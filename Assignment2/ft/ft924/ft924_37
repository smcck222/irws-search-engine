ANGELS AND INSECTS by A S Byatt Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 14.99, 290 pages
IN THE SECOND of two novellas in this volume, the poet Tennyson hears 'the
buzzing of little flying fragments of language that hung around his head all
the time in a cloud . . .', and henceforth I will always see AS Byatt
through a similar cloud of buzzing fragments.
Her mastery of the High Victorian style was demonstrated in her
prize-winning 1990 novel, Possession, but like many readers I found its
lengthy sections of pastiche difficult to enjoy. But here, AS Byatt
communicates a love of words and a delight in their diversity and power that
amounts, at times, to a giddy infatuation. The combination of high spirits
and erudition is both challenging and exciting.
Both novellas are quite separate. Morpho Eugenia refers to a large Amazonian
butterfly and is the lighter and funnier of the two. It concerns a young
entomologist, William Anderson, penniless after a shipwreck on his way back
from the Amazon. He is offered work and hospitality by one of his patrons,
Sir Harald Alabaster.
William is absorbed into the teeming Alabaster household, where he resumes
his entomological activities, providing a glass hive and glass ant-hill for
the younger children and a 'cloud of butterflies' for the beautiful eldest
daughter, Eugenia. In defiance of the conventions of Victorian realism, the
penniless hero is given Eugenia's hand in marriage. Eugenia then retires,
queen ant-like, into an all-absorbing reproductive cycle (twins twice,
giving a total of five babies in three years) while her husband argues
Darwin with Sir Harald and studies ants with the younger children and their
companion, Matty Crompton.
Matty, in spite of her lowly status as poor relation, has a considerable
intellect. While there are obvious parallels between the ant-hills they
observe so closely and the Alabaster household, Matty would extend this to
the Industrial Revolution and the American Civil War: 'analogy is a slippery
tool', says William. 'Men are not ants.'
And yet, in a sense, the reader is presented with one vast analogy, which is
also fairy tale, fable, parody and allegory. The Darwinian debates with Sir
Harald and extracts from books written by William and Matty add to the
prismatic effect, while on the realistic level narrative conventions of the
time are again defied to provide our hero - and heroine - with a happy
ending.
The title of The Conjugial Angel sent me straight to the dictionary where I
made the useful discovery that 'conjugial' was used by Swedenborg in
preference to 'conjugal'. Ah, the pleasures of erudition] This emerges in
any case from the account that follows of two seances held in 1875 in the
Margate home of Emily Tennyson Jesse. She was previously engaged to Arthur
Henry Hallam, whose death in 1833 inspired her brother's poem In Memoriam.
One of the mediums, Lilias Papagay, a clever touch, is the wife of the
Captain in whose ship the hero of the previous novella returns to the
Amazon: he has been missing for ten years, probably dead. The Swedenborgian
theorist, a Mr Hawke, is one of several characters whose condescension
illustrates just how frustrating it must have been to be a woman of
intellect in Victorian times. 'Mrs Papagay was an intelligent, questioning
kind of woman, the kind who, in an earlier age, would have been a
theologically-minded nun and in a later one would have had a university
training in philosophy . . . She did not know much history, though she had
read all the novels of Walter Scott . . .'
The matter here is more directly literary with long passages of Tennyson and
Hallam requiring a leisurely approach. AS Byatt deals with another set of
Victorian obsessions here: theology, angels, the after-life and, of course,
the conjugial. But Byatt is a compulsive story-teller and although the
telling of a story is not her prime concern, she does it extremely well.
That, and her ebullient use of language, are characteristics shared by both
these highly-accomplished novellas, the work of a first-class writer on top
form.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Books: Shades of Lear - Stephen Amidon on a novel unafraid
to be derivative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN AMIDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THOUSAND ACRES by Jane Smiley Flamingo, Pounds 5.99, 384 pages
JANE SMILEY'S remarkable new novel is a grim and utterly enthralling tale of
the poisonous effect long buried secrets can have when unearthed. Set on an
Iowa farm in the late 1970s, A Thousand Acres tells the story of an ageing
farmer, Larry Cole, who decides to divide his land among his three
daughters. The two eldest, Ginny and Rose, have lived their entire lives on
the farm and are all too willing to take control from the old man, while the
youngest, Caroline, a lawyer who has long since moved away, questions
Larry's judgment. She is summarily disowned by him, beginning a family feud
that ends in a harvest of tragedy.
If the story sounds familiar, that's because it is - Smiley has boldly
adapted King Lear into a work that lives and breathes on its own merits.
Like a Shakespearian tragedy, the story begins slowly, with a carefully
drawn portrait of the stifling customs, tedious work and suppressed passions
of a farming clan. From without, the Coles seem to be the salt of the
Midwestern earth, just what Republicans have in mind when they speak about
'family values'. Ginny, who narrates the tale, appears to be a simple,
honest woman whose willingness to take over control of the farm stems from
the most selfless of motives. Likewise with her amiably caustic sister Rose
and their hardworking husbands.
All is not as it seems in Zebulon County, however. It soon becomes apparent
that both of the sisters' marriages are fraught with violence,
misunderstanding and frustration. Their father is anything but the steady
farmer he seems to be, turning out to be an abusive, drunken tyrant. Given
this, it is hardly surprising that what starts out as an amicable
inheritance soon turns sour, the bitterness coming to a head when, true to
Shakespeare, the daughters effectively turn the crazed old man out into a
violent prairie storm. From that moment the plot kicks into high gear, with
adultery, blindness, incest, attempted murder and accidental death following
hard upon one another in a manner which manages to be both shocking and
utterly natural. What began as an almanac of honest American values ends an
epic catalogue of betrayal and loss.
The immense power of the novel stems not just from its grand scale and
pitched emotions, but also from its simple, relentless style, a voice that
reinforces the book's timeless themes and locations. It is refreshing to
read a writer who is not afraid to use such supposedly old fashioned devices
as foreshadowing to move her story along. She also manages to adhere to her
Shakespearian source in a subtle, unobtrusive way, providing the reader with
sparks of recognition without taking her eye off the plot's flow.
Smiley's strongest skill is a keen authorial balance which, perversely,
keeps us off-balance for most of the book. The reader must continually
reassess his view of characters and events. The attractive Jess, a New Age
draft dodger who becomes the love interest of the elder sisters, turns out
to be somewhat less romantic than first pictured, while Rose's husband Jack
winds up far more complex than first thought. This dark irony reaches right
down into the Iowa soil itself, seemingly fertile ground that has in fact
been poisoned by years of chemical treatment, a legacy which may very well
have caused the cancer that eats away at Rose and prevents Ginny from
bringing a pregnancy to term.
The most telling realignment in the novel comes with Ginny herself, a
confused and bitter woman who starts the story something of a saint yet soon
finds herself driven to attempted murder as she faces the most horrific of
demons. Indeed, it is by telling the story from the point of view of one of
Shakespeare's 'bad' sisters that Smiley is able to add a new perspective to
the Lear myth, showing what it must be like to be the daughter of a tyrant,
to live in a household where 'the unbroken surface of the unsaid' hides a
well of corruption and betrayal.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Books: Shylock: a figure in his own right - Anthony Curtis
on Shakespeare's favourite outcast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHYLOCK by John Gross Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18, 335 pages
AUDEN conceived of a select part of heaven where he would at last meet
Shakespeare 'lounging grandly by the bar' (rather like Sir Kingsley Amis at
the Garrick). Shakespeare as a fellow-member - the image seems wonderfully
apt. You cannot work as Shakespeare did for many years as a leading writer
and performer, part of a permanent company, without gaining a degree of
acceptance and respect from colleagues, something their obituary tributes to
him testified. And afterwards, when Shakespeare had taken retirement from
the theatre and returned to Stratford, he aimed to regain the social
position of membership of the town's hierarchy once occupied - but sadly
forfeited - by his father, a failed alderman and leather merchant.
When one turns from these sketchy biographical facts to the work,
Shakespeare's mind appears to be ignited to some of its greatest explosions
of dramatic energy by figures who undergo permanent, traumatic rejection by
the ruling group. Shakespeare endows these outcast figures with a towering
strength and puts memorable utterances of defiance into their mouths: 'I
banish you]' yells Coriolanus at his former countrymen. 'I'll be revenged on
the whole pack of you]' says Malvolio; while Timon, the devalued
entrepreneur, retires to a cave in the woods in complete isolation, uttering
curses at his former hangers-on, and living off roots plucked from the
earth. The sequence of rejection, defiance, trial and ultimate humbling (in
his case a forced conversion to Christianity) reaches its most sustained
heights in Shakespeare's depiction of Shylock the Jew.
Once conceived the figure of Shylock took lasting hold and became a part of
collective myth in a way that, for example, his stage predecessor Barabas -
Marlowe's Jew of Malta, an even more villainous character - never did. The
implications of Shylock and his career are so rich, resonating still, that
the literary and dramatic critic John Gross has thought it worth his while
to devote a whole book to this one figure. Gross studies Shylock as part of
Shakespeare's text and then as existing in his own right as a hate-icon.
With the rise of liberalism he shows Shylock being interpreted more
sympathetically - understanding alternating with hatred.
Gross resuscitates the main line of Shylockian performance from the 18th
century to the present. He demonstrates how to begin with Shylock was
established as a grotesque caricature and then transformed by a succession
of great actors into an individual of exalted stature and brought to life
with vibrant realism. This part of the story begins in 1741 when the
Irish-born actor Charles Macklin attempted the role at Drury Lane. He was in
his late forties at the time and he went on to play the part into his
eighties. Although the character he presented was in Gross's words
'unyieldingly malignant' he had researched it historically. He discovered,
for instance, that the Jews in 16th century Venice wore red hats and donned
one. Macklin's performance came as a revelation of the play's power in the
theatre.
After Macklin there were - apart from Garrick - few leading British actors
who did not attempt the part. Kean's version was a particular triumph. It
was described by Hazlitt who felt that great as it was, it tended by its
very livelines, to diminish the obsessive vengeful nature of Shylock's
character. But Hazlitt concluded that for sheer variety of response, for
'presenting a series of striking pictures and giving perpetually fresh
shocks of delight and surprise, it would be difficult to single out a
competitor'.
John Philip Kemble who played Shylock opposite Sarah Siddons as Portia - she
was his sister - was considered too remote and neo-classical. The next great
landmark was Henry Irving with whom the role underwent a complete
re-interpretation. He gave Shylock an aloof dignity based on his observation
of a Jewish merchant he had encountered while on holiday in North Africa. 'I
look upon Shylock as the type of a persecuted race', he wrote in 1884,
'almost the only gentleman in the play, and the most ill-used'.
It was a controversial reading then in a role that has continued to arouse
controversy ever since. Gross traces the lines of interpretation all over
the world - American Shylocks like Edwin Booth, German Shylocks both
pre-Nazi ones and Nazi-inspired ones like the horrible one of Werner Krauss
in 1943, and the less numerous French ones like that of Harry Baur, the
French Jewish actor who afterwards perished in Auschwitz.
There have been translations of the play into both Yiddish and Hebrew and
Gross deals with these going on to discuss Shylock in the context of the
rise of anti-semitism as a political doctrine. He scours many works of
fiction, of political and social theory, of clinical psychology, as he
tracks down the emergence of a whole family of Shylocks and Shylock-types in
novelists from Scott and Trollope to Svevo and Lewishon. Thinkers like Freud
and Marx are given their say along with the more obscure pundits who have
contributed to the debate. Gross is always immensely well-informed,
perceptive without being ponderous, and he never allows indignation to cloud
his judgment. His own view is stated clearly on the last page:
'I personally think that it is absurd to suppose that there is a direct line
of descent from Antonio to Hitler, or from Portia to the SS, but that is
because I do not believe that the Holocaust was in any way inevitable. I do
believe, on the other hand that the ground for the Holocaust was well
prepared, and to that extent the play can never seem quite the same again'.
It certainly emerges in a fresh light after one has read this learned yet
enjoyable book.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Sport: Shafts of sunlight in the shopping malls - Baseball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BASEBALL fan is both objective and subjective. Dispassionate views may
be held about players, managers, hot dogs, ballparks, even commissioners who
get sacked by avaricious mill owners, as was poor Fay Vincent's fate this
year. But there is no substitute for true passion - and for that a handy
team is the minimum daily requirement.
In this age of cable and satellite, very different from my last full season
ten years ago, that team may not necessarily be next door. Here in
Washington, superstations beam in the Atlanta Braves, whose pitching is a
pleasure to watch, and the New York Mets, who, Eddie Murray apart, please
only masochists. ESPN also provides a catholic nation wide service,
extending, for the east coast insomniac, to broadcasts of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, more error-ridden and lamentable than even the Mets.
But all this has been couch potato ersatz compared with the undiluted joy of
the real thing 45 minutes down the road. If there has been an undisputed
rookie of the season it has been Camden Yards, home of the Baltimore
Orioles, a distinguished new-old stadium built on the spot where Babe Ruth
is believed to have been born and nestling majestically among the warehouses
of the inner city. Baseball is, after all, both a city and a country game,
to be played in fields of dreams not suburban shopping malls. Camden Yards
sold out just about every home game in this its first year.
Perhaps even more miraculously, the Orioles rose to the occasion. Having
lost 95 (out of 162) games last year, they won 89 this season and were in
contention for the American League East pennant until the penultimate Sunday
of the season, dogging the much more talented Toronto Blue Jays, and only
passed in the home stretch by the resurgent Milwaukee Brewers. They did it
the old-fashioned way with sound fundamentals - solid fielding, timely
hitting and some exceptional pitching - just like the good old days when
Earl Weaver managed the Robinsons, McNally, Palmer and Eddie Murray into the
side with the best record in baseball for 20 years from the mid-60s.
Curiously, the Oriole's main man, Cal Ripken Jr, 1991's most valuable
player, had the worst year of his career. Still, he came out of it with a
Dollars 30m five year contract, the highest ever and just reward for ten
great years. With nearly 1,800 consecutive games under his belt, he is on
schedule, barring injury or complete loss of form, to pass Lou Gehrig's
record in 1995; it ought to be in Baltimore.
Round about that time, with a little luck, Mike Mussina may have record of
about 60 wins and 15 losses. In fact, if he pitches like he did in August
and September, he may never lose another game. Mind you, the same could have
been said of Steve Avery of the Braves after last season; this year he lost
as many as he won.
Mussina, in his first full season, won 18 games, lost five, averaged 7 2/3
innings per start, and gave up only just over 2 1/2 runs an outing. Only 23,
trim almost to the point of fragility, studious but self-confident, the fast
ball is quick enough, the knuckle curve wicked, the change-up capable of
rearranging a batter's spine and the control immaculate. He may have no more
natural ability than the Orioles' other young phenomenon, Ben MacDonald, but
the head is ten years older.
Robin Yount of Milwaukee and George Brett of Kansas City racked up 3,000
lifetime hits. Neither has ever hawked his wares to another club. Dave
Winfield, who does all the time, this year for Toronto, became the oldest
man ever to drive in 100 runs.
Frank Tanana of Detroit continued to win as he approaches 40. Tanana was a
flamethrowing lefty of the mid-70s. Shoulder surgery has reduced him to a
crafty military medium. The game I wish I had seen was in August in a
suburban shopping mall in Texas, Tanana against the even older Nolan Ryan,
still throwing as hard as he did when they were team mates in California.
Deviousness beat smoke and Texas did not get a run.
Of all those, only Winfield and Avery are taking part in post-season play.
The regular season title chases were underwhelming, with Pittsburgh, Atlanta
and Oakland locking up their leagues by early September. As a result I
advised the sports editor a week ago - and, amazingly, he concurred - that
the Braves would beat the Pirates simply because they had the best and
deepest pitching, and that the banged up but experienced Athletics would
knock off the Blue Jays because they had the best manager in the game in
Tony La Russa and because Toronto is not on US soil.
These predictions looked impeccable after the Braves established a 3-1 lead
and the Athletics split the first two games in Toronto. But, for Pittsburgh,
Barry Bonds discovered that he was allowed to hit the ball in post-season
play while Tim Wakefield, the casual young knuckleballer, befuddled the
Braves with gentle deliveries that danced three pasodobles and four
entrechats en route to the plate. On Thursday in Atlanta, the Pirates stood
on the threshold of the World Series, up 2-1, two out in the bottom of the
ninth, when the unheard of Francesco Cabrera, with only ten appearances at
bat all season, drove a two run single to left. The Blue Jays, meanwhile,
had shown that talent on the field can beat brains off it and beat Oakland
four games to two.
Atlanta is worth sticking with, even though its pitching now looks almost
fragile. The Braves lost narrowly the series in seven games last year while
Toronto has never been this far. Any bet is worth only a nickel, but no bet
can even be applied to the existence of next season, with the mill owners
rampant and apparently dead set on a collision course with the players, the
umpires, the fans and everybody else who denies them their unalienable right
to make a fortune.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Sport: Heavyweight selling of a title contender - Boxing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVYWEIGHT boxers are 'exorbitantly overpaid.' That's what Frank Maloney
says and he should know: he is promoting the Lennox Lewis / Razor Ruddock
fight in London two weeks from tonight and faces having to sell 12,000
tickets at an average of Pounds 86 just to break even.
'It's the richest boxing event ever staged in Britain,' claims Maloney, who
says the fight has cost Pounds 4m to stage. While that might be a lot of
money for 12 rounds on an autumn night in Earl's Court, the real prize comes
next spring when the winner fights the world champion. The reigning champion
Evander Holyfield fights Riddick Bowe on November 13.
According to many knowledgeable boxing people, Lewis is the real McCoy. 'I'm
a damned sight more confident about him than any British heavyweight in my
lifetime,' says Harry Mullan, editor of the trade paper Boxing News.
'Without any reservation, he's the best fighter I've seen in 20-odd years in
the game.'
Lewis, 27, grew up in the East End of London, the child of Jamaican
immigrants. When he was 12, he moved with his mother to Ontario, Canada. 'My
earliest memory of Lennox is of him being a rogue,' recalls brother Dennis,
now part of his management team. 'He was always a rogue. My mother took him
to Canada basically to keep him calm, because if he'd stayed in London he
would have been in trouble.'
Lewis won the super-heavyweight gold medal for Canada at the 1988 Olympics
and turned professional almost immediately. He then decided to return to
Britain rather than be lost among the heavyweight pack in north America.
'Lennox has an identity and a following in Britain that mean a lot to any
boxer, particularly one with any sensitivity,' explains John Hornewer, a
Chicago-based lawyer who has guided the fighter's career.
As a British heavyweight Lewis, inevitably, has lived under the clowning
shadow of Frank Bruno who has grabbed the tabloid boxing headlines for
nearly a decade - whether losing to Mike Tyson, opening supermarkets or
waving a fairy wand in a pantomime - and fights white South African Pierre
Coetzer at London's Wembley Arena tonight. Lewis is quite different. For one
thing, he has a penchant for 12 hours of chess as the prelude to a fight.
For another, he is a 'black' black man, with a considerable following in the
Afro-Caribbean community.
Sensing his unusual commercial potential, his management team have appointed
the RTG Partnership, as marketing consultant to the would-be champion.
Clients such as the Law Society and Marriott Hotels are more usual at RTG;
boxing is a whole new game.
'The first image is of an ugly street sport, with brutal men in the ring and
crooks outside it manipulating them,' says Mark Thomas, who is handling the
account. 'Someone like Lewis could start to change that. He's an intelligent
athlete and his operation is clearly above board. He could be boxing's
answer to Gary Lineker.'
Not the least of Thomas's strategies is to develop the appeal of Lewis to
women. The fighter's pre-fight interviews have been going to magazines such
as Chat and newspapers such as Today, which have large female readerships.
'Compared with Bruno, Lewis has started from a low awareness base,' says
Thomas. 'He's known to the cognoscenti but, when you have 17,000 tickets to
sell, you have to go outside that audience.'
No one in the camp is quite sure whether tonight's fight between Bruno and
Coetzer is a plus or a minus in the strategy. What is certain is that the
attempt by Bruno and veteran promoter Mickey Duff to interpose themselves
between Lewis and a world title bid has backfired; Holyfield has signed an
agreement to meet the winner of the Earl's Court fight at Las Vegas in
April.
Even the offer of a Pounds 5m package from Duff could not shake the pot.
'I'm not fighting Bruno. There's no chance. He hasn't fought anybody,' said
Holyfield last week. 'I have to meet either Lewis or Ruddock. It is that
simple.' Underlying the champion's 'Honest Joe' approach - bizarre behaviour
in professional boxing - is the knowledge that the World Boxing Council
would strip him of the title if he failed to meet a contractual defence.
Lewis arrived in London from his Pennsylvania training camp yesterday out of
curiousity to see the Bruno fight. He left behind an America waking up to
the possibility that there might just be a British heavyweight who won't end
up horizontal within a few rounds. Home Box Office, the cable TV station
that will show the fight, has been promoting it as part of a trio of autumn
highlights; the others are the Addams Family movie and a Michael Jackson
concert.
In practical boxing terms, the fight between Lewis and Ruddock could be the
world championship: Mullan, for one, thinks either man can beat the
lacklustre Holyfield (or Bowe, should he down the champion). Maloney admits
that Lewis's early fights were matches designed to shield him from defeat,
but claims that his recent contests have been against 'reasonable
opponents.' Mullan puts it differently. 'Lewis looks good so far, but we
haven't seen him against a really top opponent. That uncertainty is his only
weakness. If Ruddock hits him full tilt and Lewis stays up, he's the
business.'
Lewis's handlers have spent more than Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 23,000) on
sparring partners in the past month, bringing in former champions such as
Tony Tubbs and Mike Weaver. But the stakes are enormous: a British world
heavyweight champion would be a multi-million pound export industry in
himself.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Sport: The politics of creating a neutral power - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST the problems of reconciling national and international government;
then the national government's problems in forming national policies. Fate
having thus prepared current affairs for cricket, on Tuesday the
International Cricket Council announced National Grid Company's sponsorship
of 'third country', 'neutral' or 'independent' Test umpires in Zimbabwe and
South Africa this winter.
Independence is a prerequisite of good umpiring. English counties used to
take their own umpires to matches. There was so much trouble and strife that
in 1883 they opted instead for a pool of 'neutral' umpires, two from each
county, to stand only in games where their own county was not playing. It
was an immediate success.
The ICC, organisers of the new 'neutral' umpire scheme, consider the latest
plan no more than, as Chairman Sir Colin Cowdrey put it, 'an experiment . .
. a pilot scheme.' It cannot be more because it is voluntary. The ICC has no
power to enforce it. Three neutral umpires, 'Dickie' Bird and David Shepherd
(England) and Steve Bucknor (West Indies) will be on the tour of southern
Africa.
Tomorrow Bird will become the first sponsored, neutral umpire in Test match
history. Previous neutrals, notably Jack Hampshire and John Holder in
Pakistan 1989-90, were paid by their host country, not by commercial
sponsors. But then Bird is a natural for firsts and records. Tomorrow's Test
match between Zimbabwe and India will be Zimbabwe's first with full Test
status. Just for good measure, it will bring the number of Tests Bird has
umpired up to Frank Chester's record of 48.
Bird will advise local umpires in Harare and Bulawayo, where he will also
stand in Zimbabwe's two Tests against New Zealand. Shepherd and Bucknor will
umpire South Africa's four Tests against India.
What happens next is up to each country to decide for itself. India will
decide whether they want neutral umpires for England's tour of their country
after seeing how neutrals handle their tour of southern Africa. Australia
dislike the scheme and say they will not imply a lack of confidence in their
own umpires by using it.
I asked Cowdrey whether he thought the neutral scheme could be seen as a
capitulation to Pakistan's repeated demands for neutral umpires and their
complaints this summer about English umpires, as giving way to trouble
making, as weakness under pressure. 'I think we all have to look at it and
see how it goes. I can't say any more than that really.'
Presumably his hope is that the scheme will gather strength and win respect,
so that soon Test countries will only want to play where there are neutral
umpires.
The fear is that it will lose, not gain, authority for umpires by making
their nationality more important than their ability. Also by making them
more dependent on match referees, who now seem, alas, to be seen as an
integral part of game control at international level. Soon some-one will
start calling them match managers, as they sit watching their videos and
making judgments on umpires' judgments. The presence of such a reserve
force, albeit one with pitifully weak weapons, as we saw at Headingley in
July, undermines umpires' authority and lowers their confidence. If neutral
umpires are worth trying, their control should be complete.
Cricket is the last important sport without neutral umpires (or their
equivalent) for international games. The ICC accepted the principle of
neutral umpiring two years ago, but had been unable to find sponsors to make
it a reality. Only England has professional, full-time umpires. Everywhere
else the best umpires can spare little time for the job. Sir Donald Bradman
is alarmed that neutral umpires would discourage each country's
up-and-coming umpires.
National Grid's initial, and Quixotic, investment in neutral umpires is
Pounds 75,000, but neither they nor any other sponsor is likely to spend a
fortune training young umpires round the world. Not even if the umpires
discreetly advertise on their clothing the patronage they have received. So
discreet was what National Grid describe as the 'distinctive National Grid
'pylon' logo', on the breast pocket of Bird's white coat, that I didn't even
notice it, still less recognise it.
Bird is a fine umpire. He takes a simple line, unabashed by the problems of
organisation and finance. He is relying on fine umpiring to win the project
attention, approval and support. As Cowdrey said: We'll just have to wait
and see.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Motoring: Best that devalued pounds can buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL the effective devaluation of the pound change Britain's national habit
of buying more than 50 per cent of its new cars from abroad? The answer
seems to be: not necessarily, but it might.
Even if it did, would Britain's car buyers be denied a reasonable choice and
perhaps have to put up with second best? The answer to that is: emphatically
not.
To deal with the first point: There has always been an element of 'charging
what the traffic will bear' when pricing cars for various markets. Take
Denmark, for example. List prices of cars there are lower than anywhere else
in Europe. Taxes are so high that manufacturers have to slash margins to
vanishing point if they are to sell any cars there at all.
In Britain, more than 50 per cent of all cars are bought with company money
for business use. Fleets are purchased at fat discounts. This has done
nothing to lower the makers' official showroom prices, though how many cars
have been sold retail at list price in the last couple of years?
It is clear that if EC and Far Eastern makers want to keep their market
share in Britain - which you can bet your life they do - they will have to
temper the financial wind for the shorn lamb.
Mercedes-Benz UK spoke for many others when it said this week: 'We must
remain competitive if we are to preserve our highly efficient dealer
network.
'There won't be any instant price increases as a result of the pound's
depreciation against the D-mark though eventually some adjustment is
inevitable.'
What will probably happen is that the model mix of up-market marques such as
Mercedes, BMW and Audi will change slightly. Models like Mercedes 190, BMW
3-Series and Audi 80 will gain sales at the expense of the larger, dearer
cars. But the shift will not be dramatic, initially at any rate.
'We have noticed that our up-market customers are less price-sensitive than
those for our cheaper cars,' said Mercedes-Benz UK. It expects some sales
could be pulled forward as people decide to buy their Mercedes now rather
than wait for the price to rise. The big French manufacturers - PSA
(Peugeot-Citroen) and Renault - which between them account for one in eight
of all cars sold in Britain, may have to cut margins if their market share
is to keep expanding.
Italy's currency is as stricken as the pound. So Fiat (which includes Lancia
and Alfa Romeo) sees a great opportunity to lift its sagging sales and
regain market penetration in Britain. Its product range is the best for
years and it has been busy burnishing its image and improving its marketing.
But what if the pound should continue to slide and German and French cars
become costlier than they are today? The good news is that many long-term
buyers of imported cars might be agreeably surprised by the range of
British-made cars on offer.
Few motorists seem to be aware that in the near future, about 25 per cent of
the cars produced in Britain will be Hondas, Nissans and Toyotas.
The Honda Concerto sold in Britain is already made by Rover, whose 200 and
400 models are closely based upon it though nearly all have Rover's own
excellent K-series engines or a Peugeot-Citroen diesel.
Production of the new Honda Accord saloon has just started at Swindon. By
1993 this 2-litre model will be selling against the Ford Sierra (no longer
made in Britain) and the British-built Vauxhall Cavalier as well as the BMW
3-Series and Audi 80.
Other comparable British-made cars include the Nissan Primera and Peugeot
405. This French car has been assembled with many British components in
Coventry for some years. Micra will be an alternative to the British-made
Rover Metro (transformed by a heart and brain transplant nearly two years
ago) and Ford Fiesta.
Other family-type cars which can be expected to benefit from the fall in the
pound and lira are the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra (most are made in
Britain) ; and Fiat's new Cinquecento baby car, Panda, Uno, Tipo and Tempra.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Hanson unlikely to be deterred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEMERGER defence is becoming something of a textbook classic in the
takeover industry. Hanson's response to Ranks Hovis McDougall's adoption of
the ploy is that it should be flattered; but it seems unlikely to be
deterred from pursuing its bid.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, said that RHM's response
'demonstrates that there is some logic in what we do'. Even so, he seemed to
think the RHM three-way split to be a crude break up. 'People do not
understand the logic and dynamics of breaking up a business,' he said. 'You
need a clear understanding of the positioning of brands and an ability to
find the right buyer'.
Hanson is unlikely to be put off by RHM's proposal unless the prospect of a
demerger pushed the share price out of reach. That was not the immediate
effect in the stockmarket yesterday, which gave a much more muted response
than when Imperial Chemical Industries announced its demerger proposal in
July and its shares jumped 76p to Pounds 11.71 on the day. However, ICI's
shares have fallen back since, to Pounds 10.27
RHM's price is still 26p above the cash offer. Hanson need do nothing in a
hurry, apart from continuing to work on its offer document expected next
week.
It was thought from the start that Hanson would need to sweeten its offer.
Brokers believe, though, that it can pay 250p a share or more for RHM and
still enhance its earnings in the first year.
The worry for RHM shareholders would be if Hanson walked away, leaving them
without the choice of taking cash. One broker said 'Hanson has got an excuse
to walk away, but if it did it would get the reputation of being scared off
too easily.'
The bid timetable starts from the day the offer document is issued and can
then run for up to 60 days, barring an appearance from a rival bidder. RHM's
demerger plans will still be at an early stage even then. Hanson could put
more pressure on RHM shareholders by shortening the offer period, and
putting a 'take it or leave' challenge to them.

FT  17 OCT 92 / RHM fights Hanson with demerger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL yesterday, shareholders in Ranks Hovis McDougall were waiting for the
baking and grocery group to unveil a defence strategy against the Pounds
780m hostile bid launched by Hanson 10 days ago.
What they were offered was a restructuring proposal which tacitly
acknowledged that the company - or at least large parts of it - was unlikely
to remain independent under present top management for very long.
Announcing plans to demerge RHM into three businesses, Mr Stanley Metcalfe,
chairman, said the aim was to give shareholders an option to the Hanson bid
which recognised more fully the value of their investment.
'What would really be very bad news would be if our business went too
cheaply,' he said. 'We would never forgive ourselves for that.'
The increase of only 5p to 246p in RHM's shares yesterday in a buoyant
market suggests investors were not immediately convinced that they stood to
gain much from RHM's own option.
Mr Metcalfe said his board had been concerned since late spring about the
long slide in its share price, which had fallen to 135p, from 460p only
three years ago. The board had already been considering a demerger and
decided to go ahead after the Hanson bid.
A principal attraction of demerger would be to stop market perceptions of
RHM's profitable grocery and cake businesses from being clouded by the
problems of its milling and baking division, which have been largely
responsible for its weak share price.
For the past three years the division has been savaged by a bread price war,
though RHM yesterday offered a crumb of hope by announcing that it planned
to buy Dalgety's bread baking business for Pounds 28m.
RHM says the purchase, which is not conditional on the demerger going ahead,
would give it control over about half the surplus capacity in the bread
market and three modern bakeries in the south and southwest, regions where
it could use extra production. They are said to be profitable on turnover of
about Pounds 50m.
It was also encouraged by recent flour and bread price increases and by a
modest pick up in bread consumption.
However, the main bait for shareholders is in the grocery and cake
businesses, which together earned operating profits of Pounds 84.8m on sales
of Pounds 849m last year. They comprise many household names, including Mr
Kipling cakes, Bisto gravy mix, Saxa salt, Paxo stuffing and Sharwood's
relishes.
RHM believes the businesses would trade for as much as 15 times earnings as
independent quoted companies. They would also be much more exposed to
takeover by a group such as BSN of France, which has already expressed
interest in buying parts of them.
Mr Metcalfe and his colleagues stopped short of saying they wanted or
expected takeovers to be the ultimate outcome. But did not seek to conceal
the potential rewards to shareholders if they occurred, pointing out that
some branded food companies had recently been sold for 25 times earnings or
more.
Whether RHM's mixed bag of brands would command that high a multiple could
not be known until a bidder emerged. In any case, under RHM's plan, the
opportunity would not arise until after the demerger took effect in four to
six months' time.
The plan could also be complicated if there was a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission investigation into the Dalgety deal. RHM considers this unlikely
because the acquisition gives it about 22 per cent of the bread market,
below the 25 per cent threshold which triggers an MMC reference.
However, the acquisition would give RHM 35 per cent of sliced and packaged
bread sales, which account for three- quarters of the total market. That is
about the same as the share held by Associated British Foods, its main
rival.
Given these uncertainties, and the fact that Hanson's bid is governed by a
tighter timetable than demerger, RHM's newly-hatched option may offer
shareholders less of a straight choice than a fall-back contingency should a
Hanson takeover fail to materialise.

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Retailers must save themselves - John
Thornhill reports on Geoff Mulcahy's view of future trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT MONTH Mr Geoff Mulcahy will celebrate the tenth anniversary of his
leadership of the Kingfisher retailing group.
During his time at the top, Mr Mulcahy has steadily steered the group
through the 'feeding frenzy' of consumer spending that broke out in the late
1980s and the frantic frugality that has followed. In the process, he has
created one of the UK's biggest and most resilient retailers.
Born out of the 1982 buy-out of the UK arm of the Woolworths variety store
chain, the company has successfully expanded by squeezing its existing
assets and bolting on the B&amp;Q, Superdrug and Comet chains. Its market value
has grown from Pounds 150m to Pounds 2.7bn in that time.
But speaking at a Financial Times conference last month, Mr Mulcahy painted
a bleak picture of the future, warning of the strains likely to continue to
afflict the retailing sector even after the recession had subsided. His
bearish rhetoric was matched by his actions as he recently exercised his
options to sell Kingfisher shares, pocketing Pounds 1m.
In his conference speech and in a separate interview, Mr Mulcahy claimed
there had been a 'fundamental change in the dynamics of the so-called
consumer society'. The industry's obsession with continually asking when the
consumer upturn would arrive had blinded it to the underlying changes that
were taking place, he said.
'The ship's gone down and they're all clinging to the wreckage waiting for
the big white ocean liner called Recovery to come along, toss out the
lifeboats and sweep them all to safety,' he said. 'But instead of floating
about aimlessly waiting to be rescued from the shipwreck of recession, we
should be learning to live with the present conditions.'
This outburst of colourful rhetoric comes as something of a surprise from a
businessman who has built up a reputation for being laconic - even going so
far as to name his boat No Comment.
Dubbed Mogadon Mulcahy by one analyst for his dull delivery and famed for
his unnerving habit of mutilating paper clips during conversations, he
recoils from promoting his personality as was the habit of so many flashy
retailers of the previous decade.
But in many respects Mr Mulcahy now appears the man of the moment. The
retail heroes of the 1980s have all been forced to flee the scene. The
anti-hero is in the ascendant. At times, he gives the impression of quite
liking the recession; it presents him with a greater cerebral challenge.
Maybe it was because he came to the retailing industry relatively late in
his business life that he does not share the outlook of those almost born
into the trade. 'When we took over Woolworths we discovered a staff leaflet
saying that any employee sweeping the floors could rise to become chairman
We thought that was great until we realised that they viewed it not just as
an incentive but as a necessary qualification,' he says.
After a career working for Esso, Norton (the US industrial group), and
British Sugar, Mr Mulcahy has come to believe that retailing offers similar
challenges to any other business and ones that can be overcome by rational
analysis rather than instinctive responses. He believes the key determinant
of success in any industry is the ability to manage change.
In Mr Mulcahy's analysis, the rate of growth of consumer spending will be
far lower in the current decade while the challenges and costs will surely
increase. 'The demands of our customers for more convenience, wider ranges
and improved service - all at lower prices - mean one thing: lower gross
margins. Many analysts and fund managers have yet to come to terms with
this, but I firmly believe that the days of high gross margins have long
gone.'
He predicts there will only be a gradual increase in total consumer spending
over the course of the decade. While consumer credit exploded from Pounds
15.5bn in 1982 to Pounds 52bn by the end of the decade, he believes it will
grow far more slowly to about Pounds 70bn by the year 2000.
But changes in consumer lifestyles and attitudes will make customers far
more demanding, imposing additional costs on retailers. A higher percentage
of women will be employed full-time and have far less time to shop adding to
pressures for longer opening hours. The ageing population will lead to a
shift in cultural values with more discriminating worldly-wise shoppers: by
1996 the number of 35-59 year-olds in the UK will outnumber 16-24 year-olds.
The growth of 'green' consumerism will increase pressures on retailers to
scrutinise the environmental impact of their products and practices.
For retailers, Mr Mulcahy believes these strains will lead to a continuing
polarisation between the weak and the strong. Successful companies will have
to create virtuous profit circles by cutting gross margins, winning market
share, lifting levels of productivity and driving increased sales volumes
over the same space, or less - a tricky series of tasks in a sector still
suffering from over-capacity.
To succeed, he believes retailers will have to focus more rigorously on
narrowly-defined but growing markets seeking to establish market dominance.
He suggests that the focusing of the disparate Woolworths chain over the
last decade provides a template for what has to be achieved in the rest of
the Kingfisher group. 'It will be more about selling a lot of a little
rather than a little of a lot,' he suggests.
But Mr Mulcahy warns that retailers which fail to increase sales volumes to
offset the decline of gross margins will be be stuck in a 'doom loop' of
continuous contraction and cost-cutting from which it will be difficult to
escape.
City commentators suggest that Mr Mulcahy's analysis is likely to apply more
to mass consumer markets - such as DIY, electrical goods and toiletries in
which Kingfisher operates - than to specialist niche areas of the high
street which are more likely to be able to maintain high margins.
But Mr Mulcahy's remarks sound strangely reminiscent of an earlier era when
retailers - like Woolworths - derived great economies of scale from 'piling
it high and selling it cheap'. The future of retailing, it seems, lies in
the reversion to past practices - only, thanks to the wonders of information
technology, the execution of those principles can be startlingly more
efficient.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Lacroix: the man of mystery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS CHRISTIAN Lacroix is the man who put the fizz into haute couture, turning
it back into a fashion force to be reckoned with, you might expect any book
by him to be innovative. And Pieces of Pattern: Lacroix by Lacroix (Thames
and Hudson, Pounds 32) does not disappoint - at least visually. As a piece
of design in which Lacroix took a leading part, it is a succes fou, printed
in sections as bright and clashing as one of his summer dresses.
It is lavishly illustrated with collage-style photographs showing the
eclectic cultural influences on the man, and his own sketches, both for
collections and, in a cute monochrome style, of important memories, from
1960s hippies to his black-clad great-grandmother.
It will become a work of reference for students seeking to understand the
inspirations of this designer who leapt to prominence, apparently from
nowhere, five years ago. But as a read it is unsatisfactory, the title is
well-chosen because the Pieces do not add up. A series of autobiographical
sketches explain the influences but do not illuminate either his character
or background. The mystery remains, presumably intentionally.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: Cabbages fit for kings - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RED, white and green. In the beginning, that was how I thought of cabbages:
typical of the dismissive British attitude to vegetables, I suppose.
When I escaped the boarding school habit of serving vegetables killed by
drowning, I began to appreciate the differences between various varieties;
the seasons for each, their different textures and tastes - Savoy, Primo,
Christmas Drumhead, January King, Spring Greens, Curly Kale and so on.
Later still, I rejoiced in the arrival of Chinese Leaves in our shops. Pale,
crisp and mild, this most unaggressive member of the brassica tribe is
equally at home in stir fries and salads. It is excellent for stuffing and a
joy for lazy shoppers because it keeps so well.
In Portugal, my brassica tastings were extended to include Couve Galegas, a
national favourite which is more popular there than the leek in Wales. Every
Portuguese market sells this long-legged, loose-leafed vegetable (often
ready shredded for instant cooking), most gardens grow it, and no cook worth
her salt would dream of letting more than a day or two pass without putting
it on the menu.
Another lovely discovery is Cavolo Nero, which I found in Rosemary Verey's
gardens at Barnsley House*. This is a spectacular plant. Tall and
upstanding, the long leaves arch from the stems on thick, white ribs. They
are dark green and dimpled as deeply as a Savoy. The effect is most elegant.
Verey told me that she strips the ribs from the leaves, boils the greenery,
adds butter and eats it like spinach. Indeed, she sometimes refers to the
plant as Italian spinach.
Anna Del Conte - the expert to whom I turn with all Italianate queries  -
describes Cavolo Nero as having a pronounced but agreeable brassica flavour
 -slightly more bitter than many other varieties but lacking their
intrusive, cabbagey smell.
She adds that, in its native Tuscany, Cavolo Nero sometimes is just sliced
across very thinly, boiled (it might take 15-20 minutes to become tender)
and served with a good drizzle of fruity olive oil, plus a squeeze of lemon
juice if liked. More often, it is cooked with pork in rich and nourishing
stews or used in soups, of which la ribollita, the bean soup of Tuscany, is
the best known.
Here is Del Conte's recipe for la ribollita as taught at her Taste of
Tuscany cookery school and adapted for cooks who cannot lay hands on Cavolo
Nero.
LA RIBOLLITA (serves 6-8)
Whether you finish the soup with onions or not, la ribollita should always
be made a day ahead and reheated for serving, as its name implies.
Ingredients: For the beans -  1/2 lb dried cannellini beans, soaked
overnight; 1 onion, cut into quarters; 1 small celery stalk; 3 garlic
cloves; sprigs of sage, rosemary and parsley.
For the soup: 3 1/2 fl oz extra virgin olive oil; 1 sweet (red or Spanish)
onion; 1-2 dried chillis, seeded and chopped; 2 ripe tomatoes, peeled,
seeded and coarsely chopped; 1 tablespoon tomato puree; 3 potatoes and 2
carrots, cubed; 1 leek and 3 celery stalks, cut into small pieces; the dark
green outside leaves only of 1 small savoy cabbage, cut into thin strips;
about  1/2 lb spring greens, cut into thin strips; 2 garlic cloves; 3-4
sprigs of thyme.
For reheating to serve: 1-2 sweet, red or Spanish onions (optional); 8
slices of bread; 2 garlic cloves.
Method: First cook the beans gently with their flavouring ingredients in a
heavy pot with enough cold water to cover them by two inches, and 2
teaspoons of salt.
When tender, separate the beans from the liquid. Reserve 3-4 tablespoons of
the whole beans and puree the rest using the coarse blade of a food mill.
To make the soup, put into a heavy pot most of the oil, the onion, chillis,
and a pinch of salt. Saute for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and tomato puree
and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the bean puree and cook, stirring, for 2-3
minutes more.
Add the remaining vegetables and herbs. Pour on the bean liquid plus water
as necessary to make 2 pints in all. Cover and cook over the lowest possible
heat for about 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper and leave overnight.
Next day, slice very finely enough onions to lay over the surface of the
soup; put the pot into the oven and cook at 350''F/180'C (gas mark 4) until
the onion is tender, about 1 hour. (This step is optional; Del Conte
suggests omitting it if you cannot find really sweet onions).
Rub the bread with the cut garlic cloves and grill it. Put the toast into
soup bowls, ladle the reheated soup over it and dribble on the remaining
olive oil. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.
*Barnsley House Gardens, Barnsley, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire, are
open from 10-6 on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: A wine drinker's guide to the currency
markets - Jancis Robinson tries to make the best of the exchange rate
debacle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JASPER MORRIS, of fine wine importers Morris &amp; Verdin, is one of the more
exasperatingly cheerful members of the London wine trade. In the past few
weeks however, even he has been sounding as though someone forgot to wind
him up.
He is currently paying for rather a lot of 1990 burgundy priced when the
pound was worth nearly FFr10 and has also had to issue a new wholesale list
which will earn him neither friends nor profit. In Colchester meanwhile, Lay
&amp; Wheeler's man about France has been spending his days chez the local
printer, painstakingly adjusting columns of prices on his firm's new list.
Wine merchants are in the front line of the exchange rate debacle. What they
sell is almost 100 per cent imported, notably from France and Germany,
countries with expensive currencies nowadays. Here are some of the likely
and possible effects, with some suggestions as to how to make the most of
this miserable situation.
French and German wines bought recently are the worst affected, which
effectively means the younger, less expensive bottles on sale in November
and December (although champagne will not look any cheaper).
That said, the 1992 vintage in France and Germany is plentiful, if not
invariably superlative, so this should ease cellar door prices soon and
smooth out some of the currency-related increases. Don't worry, folks, we
can still give you your Pounds 1.99 Liebfraumilch]
Most major retailers are hanging back before issuing their all-important
Christmas prices. The supermarkets may decide that wine profits are worth
sacrificing in order to lure customers away from the specialist wine shops
whose pips are squeaking most plaintively.
This is a great time to buy fine wine (and fine art, antiques, houses . . .
and anything else you cannot afford). Most fine wine was imported long ago
and is now a sterling commodity. Good guys like Jasper Morris are even
responding to the almost negligible movement in the fine wine market by
reducing prices at this top end. The good news is that wines from Italy,
Spain and Portugal should not cost any more (there are healthy signs of a
return to sanity in even the most image-conscious Italian producers).
This could be just the fillip that the English wine industry desperately
needs. Look for any wine made by the skilled Australian winemaker at the
Harvest Wine Consultancy near Reading (0734- 340176). They include Thames
Valley, Boze Down, East Mersea, Moorlynch, Pilton Manor, Sharpham and
Wickham - so far. They may taste more New World than English, but that may
be no bad thing. (Waitrose, Safeway and the Co-op are trying particularly
hard with English wines.)
And New World wines themselves should not suffer too many price rises. The
British love affair with all things vinous and Australian looks set to
continue (see accompanying box).

the Galle Face. So did Lord Mountbatten. And Pandit Nehru. And Laurence
Olivier. And the Maharishi. And Bo Derek. And me.
Some are murdered with migraine. Some are banjaxed by bunions. Jet lag is my
particular purgatory. Even a London-Dublin flight leaves the body reeling
and in need of urgent resuscitation - thankfully, a commodity available
easily in the Irish capital. But a flight to the other side of the world,
especially going east, means at least a week of sleepless, nauseous nights
and fatigue-filled, dazed days.
The Galle Face is the antidote - a venerable, fusty pile of an hotel coming
up to its 130th birthday, perched on the shores of the Indian Ocean in
Colombo, Sri Lanka.
The anti-lag plan is simple. Go to Heathrow airport. Board, drink three
gallons of orange juice, sleep. Wake up, get off in the Gulf and stretch the
legs. Back on board, tease the system with a Sri Lankan-style curried
breakfast and, in a dip of a wing, fly into Colombo. Go straight to the
Galle Face. After a suitable interlude, which might last several days,
proceed on your journey, ready to meet the frenetic east head-on.
Cyril Gardner is the owner/proprietor of the Galle Face. He admits his
establishment has certain shortcomings: the water runs brown occasionally.
When it rains, the roof might leak. The lights might blink a bit. The teak
floorboards creak. Phones are not one of the Galle Face's strong points.
'I always describe my hotel as more like a cream caramel than a fancy
wedding cake,' says Gardner. 'It is imperfect, we all know that. But it is
rather special.'
Gardner purrs over the Galle Face like a cat over its kittens. He inherited
its stewardship from his wife's family, the descendants of Dutch burgher
settlers. Not so long ago, there were 600 staff. Now, there are 200. 'You
will notice many of them are elderly. I have tried to make economies but no
one has ever been sacked,' says Gardner.
To some, he might seem a trifle eccentric. There are signs at every turn:
'Please use the stairs - it's much healthier,' and 'Please don't smoke in
the bed. The ashes we find could be yours.' Gardner admits his hotel is not
everyone's cup of Ceylon tea. 'If people want business centres or all manner
of leisure activities, they should go elsewhere. People come here to relax.
There's no better place for it.'
When I was last at the Galle Face, there were few guests. The slurp of Brown
Windsor soup echoed across the dining room. Blink, and a bevy of waiters was
at the table.
One evening, at sundowner time, a black storm came galloping in from the
Indian Ocean. The tables did cartwheels across the verandah. Waiters
struggled to hold trays aloft while trying to stop the wind from blowing up
their longis. A German priest read a comic. A lady who looked like Miss
Marple ate a cream bun.
Several astronauts have touched down at the Galle Face staying in bedrooms
big enough to accommodate a galaxy. One of the hotel suites, the King
Emperor, has what is believed to be the largest lounge of any hotel bedroom
anywhere. All for a fraction of the cost of the anonymous
chocolate-on-the-pillow-type hotels which litter the world.
So far, the Galle Face has resisted takeover attempts. 'What would new
owners do with my boys?' said Gardner, pointing to two grey-haired waiters.
'They have been with the Galle Face all their lives, and their fathers
before them.'
In a perfect world, imperfect hotels like the Galle Face would be left
alone. A special fund would be created to keep the Philistines at bay. No
piped music would be allowed. Receptionists would be forbidden from saying
'Have a nice day.' Noel Coward would bounce bon mots about on the verandah.
The Maharishi would sit on the sea wall, lost to the world. Tigger Stack
Ramsay-Brown, MC, would dance with Bo Derek.
And I would sit by the hibiscus, never again to climb aboard a plane.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: An Australian alternative
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD BLOCK Shiraz may not be the only wine to be marketed as a bargain
alternative to Penfolds Grange, Australia's famously rich red 'first
growth', but it will almost certainly be the most successful. It is the
brainchild of larger-than-life Bob McLean who was trained first at Reckitt &amp;
Colman's South Australian wine operation Orlando (they who siphon off
Jacob's Creek), before moving uphill to Petaluma, the archetypal Australian
'boutique' winery now in the throes of a public flotation.
In 1988 he bought in to the then moribund Barossa Valley winery St Hallett,
determined to make Old Block Shiraz its flagship. Not content with St
Hallett's original Old Block, he started buying up every parcel of grapes
fromancient Shiraz vine stumps that could be wrested from Penfolds' grasp,
so that Old Block may now come from as many as 20 different old Barossa
vineyards and counts its production in thousands rather than hundreds of
cases.
These vines may be anything from 82 to 145 years old (although heaven knows
who keeps those vineyard records of 1847), producing almost uneconomically
small lots of exceptionally concentrated wines that are aged, separately, in
American oak casks just like Grange. The result is a deep, almost porty red
of unashamedly broad Barossa characteristics - like a softer, very slightly
lighter Grange.
The promisingly hefty 1990 vintage is expected in the UK any day now while
the exciting 1989 vintage is still in circulation for under Pounds 9 at the
Australian Wine Centre, London WC2; Adnams of Southwold; Ben Ellis of
Surrey; Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester; and Winecellars of London SW18.
The pre-McLean 1987 tastes gorgeous now and suggests that this is a wine
that, despite its come-hither appeal in youth, is worth keeping well past
its fifth birthday.
Other Barossa Shirazes made to the same Grange-like specifications somewhere
midway between Hermitage and young port include Charles Melton's Nine Popes
(which includes the Grenache grape, like Chateauneuf-du-Pape - geddit?) and
Rockford Basket Press, also sold at around Pounds 8 by Adnams of Southwold,
as well as Peter Lehmann Shiraz and Penfolds' own bargain imitation of
Grange, Kalimna Bin 28, both widely available for well under Pounds 6.
The sensational 1986 vintage of Grange sells for just under Pounds 30 a
bottle.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Lenders make cautious start to rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST building societies yesterday held back from an instant cut in mortgage
rates after the reduction in base rates, as housebuilders, homeowners and
estate agents tried to weigh up the consequences of a turbulant week.
Abbey National, the bank, National &amp; Provincial, the eighth largest building
society and Northern Rock, the 11th largest, all announced that they were
cutting mortgage rate to 9.25 per cent with immediate effect for new
borrowers and from December 1 for existing borrowers.
North of England Building Society said it was making available for some
borrowers a rate of 8.35 per cent - its lowest for 20 years. Other lenders
promised rate cuts that they would quantify later.
The prospect of a further reduction in mortgage interest rates would
normally be expected to stimulate house sales and prices, but there was only
a weak cheer when the Bank of England signalled the latest cut in base
rates. Housebuilders say most people are more concerned about the
possibility of losing their jobs than about saving a few pounds on mortgage
bills.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder,
said: 'Any reduction in interest rates is welcome, but sales are unlikely to
revive until people feel more confident about the economy and in particular
about whether they will have a job this time next year.'
Mr David Holliday, president of the House Builders Federation, whose members
build 90 per cent of the country's new homes, said the latest cut was 'a
step in the right direction, but unlikely to stimulate an immediate recovery
in the housing market'.
Abbey National, which cut its rates to 9.6 per cent for new borrowers on
Tuesday, but postponed an earlier cut in its rates from November 1 to
December 1 for existing borrowers, said the base rate cut was 'better news
than we were expecting'.
The new 9.25 per cent rate applies to loans under Pounds 60,000. Rates for
loans of Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000, are 9.05 per cent and 8.85 per
cent for loans over Pounds 100,000. These also apply to existing borrowers
from December 1.
None of the institutions cutting their rates matched the 1 point drop in
base rates.
Halifax, the country's largest building society, promised that new mortgage
rates would be announced soon and said its planned cut from 10.65 per cent
to 9.99 per cent in response to the last cut in base rates would still take
effect for existing borrowers from November 1.
Nationwide, Woolwich, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Britannia said they were
considering their positions. Alliance &amp; Leicester said it would cut rates
for existing borrowers on December 1 and announce the size of the cut next
week.
Woolwich said the size of its planned drop in mortgage rates would have to
take into account the needs of investors.
The Big Four high street banks all said their mortgage rates were under
review.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Industry calls for more of the same
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST night's welcome by industry for the cut in interest rates was tempered
with renewed calls for additional measures to end the recession.
While the Engineering Employers Federation warned that cheaper money might
feed directly through into increased consumer spending, rather than into
higher investment and increased exports, retailers said improved consumer
confidence was essential.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, welcomed the cut in
interest rates, but warned that it would not on its own lead to economic
recovery.
'It's no longer a problem of people lacking confidence,' he said.
'Businesses are paralysed by uncertainty.'
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, joined
industrialists in welcoming the reduction, but said 'still bolder' measures
were needed.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and chief executive of Ford of Britain, said he
understood the government's need to stage rates cuts in order not to 'throw
away' gains made in its anti-inflationary policy. 'We'd like to see more
cuts. But they've got to be balanced against the effect on sterling and
inflation,' he added. Mr McAllister also called for an increase in capital
investment programmes.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman of T &amp; N, the motor components group, and president
of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the cut was
'probably as much as the government can sensibly do at this time'. More cuts
were needed to improve confidence.
The Confederation of British Industry said the cut was the move 'business
has been looking for', claiming it was justified by the weakness of the
economy and by progress in trimming inflation.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said the
chancellor had now 'completed the interest rate action required' when the UK
left the European exchange rate mechanism. But the Federation of Small
Businesses said it wanted rates cut to 5 per cent.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: PM 'regrets anguish' of unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a press conference that Mr John Major would preferred never to have
given. But as the storm over pit closures engulfed his government yesterday
the prime minister had no alternative at the end of the Birmingham summit
but to give his personal account of why the government was right to put
30,000 miners onto the dole in the midst of the longest recession since the
1930s.
So as the international press filed out from the traditional EC presidency
end-of-summit briefing last night, Mr Major faced the largely hostile
questioning of a group of political correspondents scenting blood. He looked
tired and slightly irritable. But he survived with no more than a few nicks.
The House of Commons next week will be a great deal rougher.
The prime minister began with the good news - reminding his audience that
the 1-point cut in base rates would provide a further stimulus to recovery.
And if the press thought the government indifferent to the needs of
businesses, he offered assurances that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
would spend the next few weeks talking to the captains of industry.
His insistence that the 2-point reduction in interest rates and the hefty
devaluation of the pound over the past month would do nothing to re-ignite
inflation brought a cynical silence. His audience's judgment was that the
government had panicked. But it was the pit closures the journalists wanted
to hear about - and more specifically whether Mr Major would be forced to
announce his second U-turn within a month.
He gave a creditable performance. He dismissed suggestions that the
government was callous or indifferent about the miners: 'I know and regret
the anguish faced by anyone finding himself unemployed.'
He reminded critics that more often than not he was accused of shirking hard
decisions. Now one had been taken, and although there was no pleasure in
taking it there was a determination to face the economic reality that there
was no market for much of British Coal's production.
'We made the announcement sooner rather than later because we thought it
right to remove the uncertainty and because we did not think we would make a
difficult decision easier by putting it off,' he said.
'We have to get on with helping miners and their families and beating the
recession.'
Miners were emerging from a day's work to find piles of coal growing, Mr
Major said. 'Stocks are increasing by more than 1m tonnes every month and as
a result of that we have been spending Pounds 100m a month of taxpayers'
money to keep pits open even though their product has no market and is not
likely, alas, to have any market in the future.'
He was pressed on the timetable. Could the closures be phased? Perhaps
anticipating the backlash from Tory back benches next week he said simply:
'I do not anticipate any changes in the timetable.'

FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: PSBR exceeds forecasts by Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT borrowing last month came to Pounds 4bn, roughly Pounds 1bn
higher than expected, as the recession cut tax income and pushed up spending
in areas such as social security payments.
The public sector borrowing requirement for the first six months of the
current financial year came to Pounds 18.4bn compared with Pounds 10.8bn in
the corresponding period last year.
Excluding privatisation proceeds of Pounds 1.4bn, the PSBR for the month
came to Pounds 5.4bn, one of the biggest monthly totals on record. The
privatisation receipts came from part-payment investors who have taken a
stake in the regional electricity companies.
News of the worsening state of public finances underlines the probability
that the 1992-93 PSBR will exceed the Treasury's forecast of Pounds 28bn.
Many City economists think the figure will turn out at between Pounds 32bn
and Pounds 35bn.
Total cash outlays by central government departments last month totalled
Pounds 19.5bn, compared with Pounds 19.3bn in August and Pounds 17.9bn in
September 1991.
Over the first six months of the financial year which started in April, the
spending total came to Pounds 114.3bn. This figure, which is arrived at
after subtracting privatisation payments, is 8 per cent more than the Pounds
105.5bn total for the corresponding period last year.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Political turmoil is the stimulus behind cut
in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S homeowners and businesses are now in debt to the nation's
beleaguered coal miners.
The government would not have cut bank base rates by 1 percentage point to 8
per cent around noon yesterday had it not become embroiled in a bitter
political crisis over its plans to axe 30,000 mining jobs.
Before yesterday's announcement, there were growing expectations that
further cuts in base rates were in the offing following the
1-percentage-point cut to 9 per cent on September 22 in the week after
'Black Wednesday'. But it had looked as if the government might delay the
rate cut until next month's Autumn Statement containing its public spending
decisions for 1993-94 and its latest economic forecasts.
The timing of yesterday's cut - coming at midday instead of at 10am -
smacked of panic. Other circumstances pointed to a hasty decision.
On Monday, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had indicated to members of the
Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee that there would be no rapid
lowering of rates. Later in the week, the Bank of England's money-market
operations had suggested that 9 per cent base rates were likely to be in
place for at least the rest of this month.
The final decision to cut rates was taken only yesterday morning in a
meeting at the Treasury attended by Mr Lamont, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
governor of the Bank of England, Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent
secretary, Mr Eddie George, Bank deputy governor, and a number of Treasury
officials.
Although the timing of the cut was clearly linked to the government's
difficulties over the planned pit closures, yesterday's statement by Mr
Lamont provided a number of powerful arguments to justify the reduction of
base rates to their lowest level since June 1988.
The chancellor's references to M0, the narrow measure of money supply, M4,
the broad money measure, house prices and the producer prices index were
consistent with the government's new approach of basing decisions on
interest rates on a number of financial indicators. The statement also went
some way to meeting the government's promise to explain its monetary policy
more clearly to the public following sterling's abrupt departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism.
What the chancellor did not explain was how the government and the Bank of
England were taking a much gloomier view of the UK economy following events
over the past week.
Since Mr Lamont appeared before the Treasury committee, the government had
been given news of falling industrial production in August and rising
unemployment in September. It also had access to Bank of England figures,
due next week, pointing to continued slow monetary growth and subdued bank
lending last month. The coal closures, quite apart from the political damage
that they caused, were another economic factor to take into account. The
events of the week had also damaged consumer and business confidence.
Developments in financial markets also favoured lower interest rates. For
the domestic money market, it had become a question of when, not whether.
Increasingly, foreign exchange market analysts were arguing that the
prospect of a long recession was weighing more heavily on sterling than the
likelihood of a cut in interest rates.
It emerged yesterday that a reduction in base rates to around 8 per cent had
been under consideration by monetary authorities since Britain's departure
from the ERM on 'Black Wednesday'.
In the view of the both the Bank and the Treasury, UK monetary conditions
had become far too tight while sterling was linked to the strong D-Mark and
Britain was unable to bring its interest rates below German levels in the
ERM.
After leaving the ERM, the government had set about rebalancing policy -
easing monetary conditions through lower interest rates against the
background of sterling's trade-weighted devaluation of around 10 per cent -
while finalising tough public spending decisions.
Officials would have preferred to delay yesterday's rate cut until the
Autumn Statement was ready. But political necessity intervened. The decision
to cut rates was probably two-thirds rational economic judgment and
one-third political opportunism.
The anticipatory nature of the rate cut suggests that the authorities will
not be quick to follow up with a further sharp reduction in rates. The
feeling among officials is that monetary policy has been adjusted to
compensate for the earlier excessively tight conditions in the ERM.
Both the Bank and the Treasury will be watching carefully to see how
sterling reacts to developments. There will inevitably be some inflationary
impact as a result of its depreciation since Black Wednesday, although the
recessionary forces in the economy are now felt to be so strong that this
will be limited.
There is some concern that sterling - at around DM2.44 yesterday - is
undervalued against the D-Mark and that this could create unwelcome
inflationary pressures if maintained for more than a few months. But it is
hoped that sterling will recover against the D-Mark as the economy picks up
and when Germany cuts its interest rates. However, yesterday's decision on
base rates was not based on any expectation of an early relaxation of German
monetary policy.
The unanswerable question is whether 8 per cent base rates will suffice to
bring the UK's longest post-war recession to an end. Even before the plans
to close down much of Britain's coal industry, the August drop in industrial
production suggested that gross domestic product in the non-oil onshore
economy would be either flat or fall again in the third quarter. This week's
news has done nothing to allay fears that unemployment will keep on rising.
The international economy is also deteriorating. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development this week revised down its
expectations of growth in the industrialised world to 2.1 per cent next year
from the 3 per cent forecast in June. Unemployment is expected to average
more than 10 per cent in the OECD's European member states next year as
growth averages only 1.5 per cent.
There is some good economic news to be found in Britain. Unit labour costs -
up 1.8 per cent in August compared with August last year - are rising less
than in other big economies. Foreign manufacturers are also buying more from
Britain. But the bad news continues to outweigh the good, depressing
confidence and making uncertain the expansionary effect of cuts in interest
rates.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Major abandons policy for crisis management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR could not escape the painful irony. At last week's
Conservative party conference he was pursued by journalists demanding to
know how he would bridge the deep divisions in his party over Europe. As he
set about that task at the Birmingham summit yesterday he was dogged by
journalists aghast that he was absorbed in the arcane intricacies of
European decision-making when the coal closures threatened to push Britain's
economy from recession into slump.
It was no use the prime minister crying foul. After its mishandled decision
to shut down nearly a third of Britain's coal mines, the government faces
the most turbulent period in British politics since the winter of discontent
which brought down the Labour government in the late 1970s.
Belated realisation of that dismal prospect jolted Mr Major into ordering
yesterday's cut of 1 percentage point in interest rates. But the government
has yet to demonstrate that it has fundamental answers equal to the crisis.
The most startling development has been the way in which the decision to
shut the pits crystallised discontent across a broad swathe of the
Conservative party. As cabinet ministers admitted privately that they had
simply failed to foresee the scale of the popular backlash against the
closures, the fate of 30,000 miners replaced Europe as the lightning
conductor for the deep disquiet among Tory MPs.
Governments are frequently accused of being callous about the fate of their
citizens. They are used to charges of incompetence when things go wrong.
But, as one of the most thoughtful of Mr Major's ministers admitted this
week, when both charges can justifiably be levelled simultaneously, a
government must be ready to acknowledge that it has lost its grip.
The minister might have added that something has gone terribly wrong when a
Conservative government contrives to allow Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the
NUM, to present himself as a credible representative of the popular mood.
Mr Major is not alone in the firing line. Mr Michael Heseltine, one of the
most experienced ministers in the cabinet, has seen much of the gloss
stripped from his reputation by the handling of the coal decision.
Ministerial colleagues can scarcely believe that the trade and industry
secretary was bounced by British Coal into bringing forward the announcement
because of a spate of leaks - particularly since many of those were
traceable to ministers.
No-one should doubt Mr Heseltine's capacity for recovery - but even his
admirers were admitting that grand talk of a strategy to revive the
manufacturing sector now had a distinctly hollow ring.
Mr Norman Lamont's apparent inability to foresee that an immediate shutdown
of the pits would snuff out the remaining embers of hope for an end to the
recession has reinforced the judgment of cabinet colleagues that the
chancellor is living on borrowed time. Shunning those whom he suspects of
conspiring against him, Mr Lamont has the look of a beaten man.
The failure of those charged with presentation of government policy to
provide a convincing explanation of how the pits decision was reached -
yesterday's announcement that Mr Heseltine had told most cabinet ministers
on Tuesday only added to the confusion - has strengthened the impression
that Mr Major's closest advisers are political amateurs.
It was not until the Tory press had subjected the government to more than 48
hours of sustained invective that Downing Street realised there was some
significance in the way ministers had decided to put 30,000 more people on
the dole.
The cut in interest rates will ease some of the more immediate pressure at
Westminster by detaching some recruits to the threatened backbench rebellion
when MPs debate the closures next week. But the blunt criticism yesterday
from Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 committee of backbench
MPs, provided a reminder that lower mortgage costs might not be enough to
prevent a defeat at the hands of the Opposition.
Lower borrowing costs carry with them a more serious risk. Yesterday's long
Treasury justification for the relaxation of policy only reinforced the
impression that the government had been panicked into the move by this
week's critical headlines.
On Monday Mr Lamont, in his evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil
Service committee, stressed that the combination of sterling's devaluation
and the 1 point cut in rates announced last month provided ample scope for
economic recovery. Only one thing had changed by yesterday - the
government's announcement of pit closures.
Mr Lamont and his colleagues can now do no more than pray the markets do not
respond next week by sending the pound into free fall. Putting rates up
again would, in the words of one minister, be 'unthinkable'. But so too
would be another substantial devaluation.
Some in the Tory party - and in the government - are drawing a still more
dangerous conclusion. Their fear is that the vacuum at the heart of economic
policy left by sterling's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism is being filled not by a rational assessment of priorities but by
a series of reflex short-term responses to whatever happens to be the latest
crisis. The raison d'etre of economic policy for the past two years - the
defeat of inflation - has been unceremoniously dropped in favour of crisis
management.
Those in the cabinet who believe that sterling can and should be returned to
the ERM after a decent interval are fearful that over the next few months
the government may once again throw away the prize of medium-term economic
stability.
Next month Tory MPs will be asked to swallow the bitter medicine of deep
cuts in public spending. Many more than 30,000 jobs may be put at risk. The
question one minister was asking was whether Mr Lamont would then feel
obliged to lop another point off interest rates to make it palatable.
Mr Major is convinced that he will survive the storm with his economic and
European policies intact, if not unscathed. There is no tangible evidence of
a serious threat to his leadership. But in recent weeks his government has
looked like a bystander at the mercy of events. It cannot afford another
mistake like this week's.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Lamont predicts recovery based on low
inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont issued this statement after cutting interest rates:
HAVING reviewed with the Bank of England the various indicators of
inflationary pressure, I have concluded that a further cut in interest rates
of 1 per cent would be fully consistent with the government's inflation
objectives as set out in my statement to the Commons' Treasury and Civil
Service Select Committee.
M0 (the narrow measure of the money supply) is close to the centre of its
target range. Although no monitoring range has been set for M4 (the broad
measure of the money supply) its annual rate of growth, approaching 5 per
cent, is at its lowest level for 20 years. M4 lending is also growing
slowly.
House prices fell 2.75 per cent last month, bringing the fall over 12 months
to 7.5 per cent. Surveys of inflationary expectations point to continuing
downward pressure. The producer prices index, excluding food, drink and
tobacco, rose by only 2.6 per cent over the past year. There has not been a
lower rate of growth since 1969.
Recent data and surveys, in this country as in the rest of the world, show
that disinflationary forces remain strong and confidence weak.
The exchange rate has fluctuated around a level which, in current
conditions, does not pose a significant threat to the government's inflation
objectives in the short term.
These indicators, on top of the progress we have made in curbing inflation,
provide a firm basis for a sustainable reduction in UK interest rates. This
will be welcome to millions of families up and down the country with
mortgages; and to British business, which now has the lowest official
interest rates in the European Community and a highly competitive exchange
rate.
We have now had a substantial, but justified, easing of monetary conditions
since sterling's membership of the exchange rate mechanism was suspended.
Provided cost and price inflation are kept firmly under control, British
industry can look forward with confidence to a pick-up in domestic and
overseas sales.
Over the weeks ahead the government will be consulting closely with
industry; and I shall set out the prospects for the British economy,
together with the government's expenditure plans, in the Autumn Statement
next month.
A recovery based on low inflation is the only path to the secure jobs and
rising prosperity we all want to see. I am not prepared to place that
prospect in jeopardy by taking any risks with inflation and will be ready to
tighten policy if our inflation objective should be threatened further
ahead.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Industrialists call for more of the same
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest interest rate reduction was given a warm welcome by the business
community last night, although there were renewed calls for additional
measures to help end the recession.
While the Engineering Employers Federation warned that cheaper money might
feed directly through into increased consumer spending, rather than into
higher investment and increased exports, retailers said improved consumer
confidence was essential.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, welcomed the interest rate
cut but warned that it would not on its own lead to economic recovery.
'It's no longer a problem of people lacking confidence. Businesses are
paralysed by uncertainty'. He added: 'Ever since Black Wednesday there has
been an increase in this uncertainty'. He feared the country was locked in a
'downward spiral' and warned of the risk of a 'slump'.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, joined
industrialists in welcoming the reduction but said 'still bolder' measures
were needed.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and chief executive of Ford of Britain, said he
understood the government's need to stage rates cuts in order not to 'throw
away' gains made in its anti-inflationary policy.
'We'd like to see more cuts. But they've got to be balanced against the
effect on sterling and inflation,' he added.
Mr McAllister also called for an increase in road-building and other capital
investment programmes to give the construction and other industries a
kickstart.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman of motor components group T &amp; N and president of the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the cut was 'probably as
much as the government can sensibly do at this time'. More cuts were needed
to improve all-round confidence.
The Confederation of British Industry described the cut as the move
'business has been looking for', claiming the reduction was justified by the
weakness of the economy and progress in reducing inflation.
Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, said the
chancellor had now 'completed the interest rate action required' when the UK
left the exchange rate mechanism. But the Federation of Small Businesses
said it wanted rates down to 5 per cent.
Sir Malcolm Field, managing director of retailers WH Smith, welcomed the
interest rate cut but said it was unlikely to make a significant difference.
'It all helps but until such time as the housing market improves and people
have more confidence then I do not believe it will be material,' he said.
Mr John Randall, finance director of MFI, the UK's biggest furniture
retailer, said he believed the interest rate weapon may now be of only
limited use in stimulating consumer demand in the absence of other measures
to restore growth in the economy.

FT  17 OCT 92 / So farewell then, Che Guevara: John Barham on a
revolutionary who was killed 25 years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERNESTO 'Che' Guevara was born, lived and died in another time. He might
have been killed only 25 years ago this month, aged 39, but he belongs to a
different world. The future Guevara hoped to shape now seems as distant as
the utopias dreamed of by the Communards of 1870 Paris, the anarchists of
civil war Spain, or the revolutionaries of May 1968.
As perhaps the last romantic folk hero, and certainly the most famous of
Latin America's guerrilla warriors, Guevara embodied the lethally simplistic
revolutionary who believed sincerely that idealism, sacrifice and permanent,
violent, struggle could one day build a perfect society of freedom, justice
and plenty for all.
Guevara lives on, emblazoned innocuously on countless T-shirts, posters and
badges. It is easy to picture his stark features etched in black against a
flaming red background: his beret, long, scraggly hair and a distant,
mystical look in his eyes. But the teenagers who look to Guevara are less
interested in his life as a revolutionary than in the glamourous, romantic
picture of a rebellious free spirit.
Che's appeal is undeniable. He was a wealthy, middle class youth who
qualified as a doctor in Buenos Aires only to abandon the promise of a
comfortable life to travel penniless through South America. He met Fidel
Castro, then exiled in Mexico, in 1955 and they formed the nucleus of a
rebel band that at first numbered only 16 men at the beginning of the Cuban
revolution.
Their uprising is an astonishing saga of revolutionaries who triumphed
through luck, courage and determination. They almost starved and faced the
constant threat of annihilation, yet they went on to defeat - against huge
odds - a corrupt, reactionary dictatorship.
But in 1965 Che, the revolutionary hero, effectively abandoned Cuba,
probably horrified at Castro's bureaucratic institutionalisation of the
revolution. That year, Guevara quit as industry minister to lead a motley
guerrilla band in Bolivia rather than compromise his ideals by becoming
involved in the difficult - and morally ambivalent - process of organising a
state.
Che's vision of igniting revolutionary wars of liberation throughout South
America was as quixotic as it was idealistic, and demonstrated a disturbing
separation from reality. One of the perplexed Bolivian peasants present at
Guevara's death at the town of La Higuera said: 'He came to liberate us, but
we did not understand.'
His death at the hands of Bolivian troops - led by CIA advisers - on October
8 1967 seemed almost pre-destined. His violent end was appropriate for a man
fascinated by death and violence in the best Argentine melodramatic
tradition. Clearly, he had given the subject considerable attention.
Recalling (in a campaign diary he kept during the Cuban revolution) the
moment in 1956 when he was wounded slightly in a shoulder, Che wrote: 'I
thought of myself as dead. Immediately, I began to think about the best way
of dying in that minute when all seemed lost. I remembered an old story by
Jack London where the hero, leaning against a tree trunk, prepares to end
his life with dignity, knowing he was condemned to freeze to death in the
frozen plains of Alaska. This is the only image I remember.'
By dying before he grew old, Guevara passed into world consciousness as a
mystic enveloped in revolutionary purity. If he had lived, Che would be 64
now and probably be a grandfather, perhaps paunchy and balding like Fidel
Castro who has gone from beloved national hero to solitary tyrant.
In his biography of Castro, American journalist Tad Szulc comments that the
sensitive and highly intelligent Guevara probably sensed this and
deliberately chose exile and eventual death in Bolivia's benighted interior.
Our modern picture of Che, the self-denying revolutionary, could hardly be
more distant from that of his successors. The urban guerrillas of the 1970s
in Germany, Italy and Argentina appear to us now as psychopaths. The fat,
bespectacled and middle-aged Abimael Guzman, leader of Peru's feared Shining
Path guerrillas who was sentenced this week to life in jail for treason, is
linked in our minds to Pol Pot, not Che Guevara.
Guevara is, to many, forever the romantic, valiant and mystical harbinger of
peace and understanding. The famous, scratchy black and white photos of the
dead Che, stretched out with his chest perforated with bullets, has
transformed him into a modern-day hero who gave his own life for an ideal.
But the myth obscures the sinister side of his character. Like all
revolutionary purists before him, Guevara isolated himself gradually from
the real world in an attempt to create the new man of socialist society,
untainted by selfishness, competitiveness, or individualism. He dreamt of
sparking off a South American version of the Vietnam war that would unleash
great Marxist revolutions across the continent.
In his last radio message, from his Bolivian jungle hideout to a third world
conference in Havana, Che exhorted: 'How closely we could look into a bright
future should two, three or many Vietnams flourish throughout the world with
their share of deaths and immense tragedies, their everyday tragedies, their
everyday heroism, and their repeated blows against imperialism.'
Yet, in spite of this macho posturing, Guevara probably was perceptive
enough to see himself as much a Don Quixote as a proletarian Simon Bolivar.
In one of his last letters to his parents in Buenos Aires just before
leaving Havana, Che wrote: 'Once again, I feel beneath my heels the ribs of
Rosinante (Quixote's horse) . . . I return to the road with my lance under
my arm.'

FT  17 OCT 92 / Fishing: Hooked on modesty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS suggested forcefully to me the other day that I was becoming prey to
that most odious of indulgences, false modesty. No one could catch as few
fish as you and stick at it, the thesis went. Ergo, you do catch fish but
prefer to give us all that sackcloth and ashes humbug about failure and
humiliation.
My protests were brushed aside. What we want, I was told firmly, is a
triumph. And, happily, while I was pondering the morality of inventing
something, a triumph was delivered into my lap on such a scale as to render
my impatient critic speechless.
In all conscience, I cannot claim much credit for it, except that it was my
idea that we should go to Ireland and to the Cork Blackwater, now blessed
above all rivers. It was luck, pure luck. Even the least deserving of us
come by a slice now and then.
It was all the more marvellous for being so improbable. The weekend before
we were to go, appalling news came. 'He says there's a 7 ft flood,' my wife
informed me, as casually as if reporting that she had forgotten to buy bread
for breakfast. I tottered, consumed by a vision of a brown torrent bearing
smashed trees, Kerrygold cows and all our hopes out to sea.
But then, perhaps in answer to fervent prayer, the deluge ceased. By the
time we reached Careysville, the duke of Devonshire's lodge overlooking the
Blackwater near Fermoy, the river had resumed a more orderly way of life.
'You'll get a fish,' was the matter-of-fact prediction from cheery,
round-faced Paddy Egan, our ghillie. Hope struggled with disbelief.
My campaign opened disastrously. I showed Paddy my spinning line and he said
it was too light. I said it was all I had. He shrugged his shoulders. Second
cast, I hooked a fresh-run fish of about 8 lb. The line broke.
Oddly enough, it was the day Britain left the exchange rate mechanism - a
matter of trifling importance compared with my loss although I fancy Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, might have felt something of the same despair which
overwhelmed me. Paddy was not wholly sympathetic as he marched me off to the
tackle shop to replace my line.
I caught nothing that first day, although I had the dubious pleasure of
watching one of my companions pull out three within 20 minutes. Paddy beamed
at him like a teacher with his prize pupil. Since this is supposed to be my
triumph, though, I shall pass over those salmon, particularly as they
inspired in their captor an unworthy display of gloating.
Nor shall I dwell on the 12-pounder which another member of the party caught
below Careysville weir next morning. My time came that afternoon. At almost
the same spot where that gullible trio had given themselves up the previous
day, I had two salmon, 11 lb and 8 lb. Now I basked in Paddy's approval.
Thus far, all the fish had been caught spinning, with a deadly lure which
was developed at Careysville and is now famous throughout Ireland. It is
known as the Flying C - which stands, I am distressed to say, for condom.
The resemblance is undeniable.
Now, spinning is all very well but fly fishing is better - apart from which,
no true angler would wish to acknowledge that he owed all his success to an
airborne birth control device. So, the next morning I fished the fly down a
gorgeous pool at the bottom of the Careysville fishery, which they call
Corrineen.
The sun shone, a soft breeze rustled the yellowing leaves and, halfway down,
a fish took. I was transfixed and did nothing. It hooked itself and, after a
tussle, I landed it. It was small, only 6 lb, but fresh from the sea and
lovely to behold. It made me a happy man.
In fact, the whole trip had the blissful quality of the best dreams. The
house was like the nicest sort of small country hotel, without the
inconvenience of other guests. They asked us if we liked lobster and served
five between the four of us, fresh that morning from the market in Cork.
We ate like men possessed - I can still savour the smell of the hot crab pie
which preceded the apple crumble with which we were provided in the cricket
pavilion which serves as Careysville's fishing hut.
And - heaven be praised - there were fish. We had 19 salmon in 3 1/2 days,
two-thirds of them from Careysville and the rest from another stretch
upstream. Yes, it was a triumph. Now, I have gone back to being the angling
non-achiever nature intended; but the memories will keep me warm through
winter.

<TEXT>
This is one of the finest roses to grow for fruits or hips, which are long,
flask-shaped and shining red. It is one of the wild roses of China and
several variations of it exist. Probably the best for garden planting is
called Geranium but the single flowers of this have not got the magnificent
blood red of the wild plant; instead they are geranium red.
The stems are stout, heavily armed with thorns and can grow 10 ft high but
can be kept lower by pruning. The variety geranium is about half this
height. All kinds are completely hardy, will grow in any fertile soil and
need little pruning beyond removal of damaged, diseased or worn out stems in
winter.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Gardening: Paradise on the crest of a Wave - Robin Lane Fox
tracks Columbus and discovers a hint of heaven on the fringe of New York
City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER topical, I have just returned from my horticultural re-run of 1492. I
have seen it all, from Spain to America, with Columbus before me: I have
followed the poet Lorca precisely, from Spanish Granada to New York. I, too,
have shuddered at the big city's darker side while on a Lorcabout of my own:
unlike him, I have also shuddered at the rivers of modern development which
now pour ever further on to the plains beneath Granada, the source of his
poetic vision.
On present evidence, I can confirm that Columbus's one observation about
gardening was as inaccurate as all his map reading: off Venezuela, he
believed that he had found the edge of the beloved garden of Eden. To a
self-taught man, the evidence was as overwhelming as DM2.95 to the pound.
Four rivers were flowing downhill, like rivers mentioned in Genesis; the
landscape was lush and luxuriant and the residents were luscious and naked.
From this fringe of divine horticulture, Columbus believed that the world
rose upwards, shaped like a female breast whose nipple was the centre of
Eden. Significantly, he never returned to check out his anatomy at the top
of the world. It was just as well because, from Spain to America, I have
found nothing to prove him right.
Somewhere, perhaps, there is an unmapped Eden, going topless where I cannot
find it. From Granada to Central Park, I have checked out the greenery; I
have cypresses clipped like pencils on terraces of narrow carmen-gardens; I
have seen myrtles in need of pruning and bedding plants in need of instant
eradication.
On the fine hill of the Generalise garden, red salvias luxuriate, a far cry
from paradise; there is a hint of heaven in New York streets where the trees
are ginkgoes, but there is nothing heavenly in the Strawberry Fields garden
commemorating John Lennon's name. After two weeks, I needed orientation: it
was lucky that friendly gardeners told me about Wave Hill.
Wave Hill is not Eden or Sissinghurst but, if paradise is the place which
seems the best of the moment by contrast, it has a claim to be taken
seriously. It is open every day except Monday and, to find it, you must
travel along the Hudson river on a half-hour's journey from New York's Grand
Central to Riverside station and a neat, green, garden suburb.
In 1843, an American lawyer, William Morris, brought his bride to view the
hillside where he had just bought some 20 acres. 'It looks like a wave,' she
is said to have told him. So, Wave Hill was born, overlooking the broad
river on the edge of modern New York City. From its upper terrace, you might
still expect to see smoke signals rising from the unspoilt woods on the far
bank.
New York's Eden became a garden through money and immigrant talent. The site
was brought to life by George Perkins, a business partner of JP Morgan who
was hyper-active between 1903 and 1920. He worked with Albert Millard, a
head gardener who had trained in royal service in Vienna; together, they
laid out a garden in the English style. Two Scottish head gardeners
followed: like Bagatelle, the gem of Paris, Wave Hill struck an English
chord on the fringe of a great metropolis. Perkins seems to have caught
other English habits: a leading financier, he retired at 50 to focus his
abilities on social challenges. One of these was to give bits of the garden
to people who admired him. The various houses there have a long roll of
honoured residents. Toscanini rented one of them and Mark Twain built a tree
house in the garden.
Since 1960, Wave Hill has belonged to the city of New York; since 1967, it
has been managed by a hero of east coast gardening, Marco Polo Stufano, who
is its director in his silver anniversary year. He has been essential to its
identity.
Early October is an unfair test of a flower garden, even in a local Eden.
Wave Hill's trees are spectacular, covering more than 700 varieties; its
salvias are so much rarer and subtler than modern Spain's with names like
Cinegel D'Oro, a pale beauty from Mexico.
Plantsmanship is unusually evident, from the fine pans of wild cyclamen in
the alpine house to the many intriguing types of plant from American states:
odd lespedezas from California or huge bushes of vibernum Setigerum with
spectacular scarlet berries.
The climate in summer must be pretty awful and winters are a cold Zone VI:
nonetheless, echoes sound pleasantly from across the Atlantic, whether a
purple origanum Hopleys or a bright red verbena Lawrence Johnston. The
conservatories could teach us all a lesson, not least that the violet-blue
thunbergia grandiflora would look great if well-grown under grass in
Britain.
If you love best English gardens best, will it bowl you over? Not, I think,
if my eye is fair to its earlier seasons. There is too much potent colour in
strong combinations; the water garden is too reedy and feathery and,
although the climate must set limits, the plantings on the big pergola do
look rather dull.
Perhaps it is only temporary, but the view from the upper terrace falls into
a mud patch and then gives way to the wilder shores of the Hudson. The
gardens peter out into the sort of wild asters you can see on the cuttings
by the south London railway at Clapham Junction. The Garden Trail puts a
brave face on it: 'Wave Hills's urban woodland is a living laboratory for
observing human influence on our environment.' So are England's Network
South-East rail commuter lines.
Delighted by the trees and the controlled craftsmanship, I veered to the
right through the social challenges and found myself on the terrace of Wave
Hill's main house. Nowadays, they sell a palatable tea and, as the Columbus
re-run merged into jet lag, I fell into a cosmopolitan dream.
The Alhambra Spain seemed to have been auctioned on Wall Street and somebody
was asking to see my papers in the sort of German spoken in Munich's great
botanical gardens. I awoke, expecting politically correct Indians with a
blowpipe. Instead, there was a line of white-flowered fibrous begonias,
fellow-trackers influencing the environment with wonderfully democratic
indifference, and the sounds from three tables of Hebrew-quoting Jews,
appreciating the Black Forest gateau. Was not Hebrew supposed to have been
spoken in the garden of Eden? Perhaps Columbus, had been right, after all.
I took my leave of the finest green refuge on New York City's outskirts: the
evening bell was sounding and somebody was driving a car along the lower
terrace to remind us that highway morals rule. Taking leave of the lovely
viburnums, I descended the hills, to find signs to a Hebrew home for the
aged. The evidence vanished, like Columbus's before me, and I was left with
an afternoon's memory of a garden with a view across its broad, bold river
that even a Scotsman would envy.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Gardening: Moving in the best circle - Arthur Hellyer
suggests trees suitable for celebrating Europe's single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SINGLE European market is due to start from January 1 and, as part of
the celebrations, it is being suggested that tree circles should be planted
in all 12 countries of the European Community.
The idea goes far beyond planting just one or two circles in each country.
What is envisaged is that local communities, groups and individuals, such as
industrialists, schools, golf clubs - even private householders - should
plant circles of appropriate size and character in villages, playing fields
and open spaces everywhere.
If small trees are used, a circle need not take up a lot of space and could
be very decorative. Each circle should, of course, consist of just 12 trees,
one for each of the EC countries. Clearly, it is open to debate as to
whether circles should have only one kind of tree, but problems multiply if
the trees chosen do not grow at approximately the same rate and finish up at
about the same size.
Notcutts Nurseries of Woodbridge, Suffolk, has produced a useful leaflet
suggesting trees for circles of three different sizes: eight metres
(approximately 20 ft) in diameter, 14 metres (46 ft) and 25 metres (82 ft).
The smallest circle certainly should fit into many gardens and two tree
varieties are suggested for it (although of it is not made entirely clear if
they can be mixed together): the popular, erect-growing Japanese cherry,
Ama-no-gawa; and Malus Maypole one of the new Ballerina apple trees.
These carry a gene which regulates production of side branches, keeping them
all very short so that the trees are virtually self-pruning, single-stemmed
cordons. Four of these varieties already are available widely; Maypole is
the one grown primarily for ornament and also as a pollinator for other
apple varieties since its fruits are small and decorative, suitable for
jelly-making but not eating. The plentiful blossom is carmine.
A circle of this kind would certainly be very attractive but I wonder if
gardeners might not prefer to use all the four available Ballerina apples:
Polka, with light and green fruits; Bolero, which has good-sized green and
golden fruits; Waltz, red and green, all three dessert varieties; plus
Maypole.
More varieties are in the pipeline and I particularly like the look of
Telamon, which is an all-red dessert apple that seems to be a heavy cropper.
For the medium-size circle, Notcutts has four suggestions, two of them for
native trees which would appeal to conservationists. One of these is the
field maple, Acer campestre, which grows especially well on chalk and
limestone and has an extended leaf-colouring period in the autumn. The other
is the rowan (or mountain ash), Sorbus aucuparia asplenifolia being the one
selected because it is particularly decorative.
The exotic trees chosen are Malus tschonoskii and Pyrus calleriana
Chanticleer. The first is an erect-growing apple species which has white
flowers and yellowish-green fruits tinged with purple, but neither flowers
nor fruits are produced very freely.
The real glory of this tree is its autumn leaf colour when it turns crimson,
purple, orange and yellow. It is naturally like a pyramid in shape. So, too,
is Pyrus Chanticleer, and this also is grown primamrily for its rich autumn
colour. It would be easy to think of a score of others including good,
golden-leaved trees such as Robinia Frisia or Gleditsia Sunburst; or the
sweet gum, Liquidambar styraciflua, which has rich autumn colour.
For the large circle, Notcutts suggests ash, lime, Norway maple and the wild
cherry, Prunus avium. Again, the selection could be widened to take in many
other fine trees including oak, beech and hornbeam, all of which have erect
forms which take up much less lateral space than the normal types.
The narrow, or fastigiate, form of beech called Dawyck also has
purple-leaved and golden-leaved varieties. These are all particularly narrow
trees when young but, after 15 years or so, they start to widen a little
although the branches still grow upright.
The erect hornbeam has a fairly narrow, cone-shaped head of branches and is
popular for street planting. The cypress oak is called Quercus robur
fastigiata, and is as narrow as the Dawyck beech when young.
It is always upright but widens with age; my 30-year-old specimen has a
spread of about 24 ft at 10 ft above ground level. So, 12 trees of this
would require quite a big circle, although nothing like as much as for an
ordinary oak tree.
An altogether different, more formal effect could be obtained by planting
fastigiate conifers such as the Irish juniper (Juniperus communis
hibernica); the even narrower J. Virginica Skyrocket; or Irish yew in green
or golden-leaved forms or both intermingled.
These would probably be too dramatic for countryside planting, but could
look very effective in some garden and park settings and would not take up a
great deal of room.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Leaders want to speed up Yugoslav aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders agreed last night to speed up their help to the
hundreds of thousands of people in the former Yugoslavia facing death and
starvation as winter approaches.
A declaration by the 12 heads of government underlined the importance of
providing winter shelter and ensuring the delivery of relief supplies. It
said EC aid worth Ecu213m (Pounds 167m) was ready for immediate
disbursement. It includes 120,000 tons of food, medicines, shelter and 40
trucks.
Member states said they would immediately provide further staff and
resources, practical and financial, to strengthen the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees' capacity in the region. The Community would also
immediately establish a task-force to support the efforts of UNHCR to
deliver humanitarian aid.
To make aid more effective, the European Council called on the UNHCR to set
up next week a meeting of technical experts on emergency aid and, next
month, a stock-taking conference to assess the effectiveness of the
operation and recommend further measures.
The heads of government called on other international donors to make a
commensurate effort to support the UNHCR appeal.
Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Mr Dobrica Cosic, the federal president of
Yugoslavia, yesterday called for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's
resignation, intensifying pressure on the controversial socialist leader.
Mr Cosic, a writer who has wielded tremendous influence in Serbian politics,
for the first time appears to have drawn battle lines between Serbia's
ruling socialists and the federal government.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Contrite leaders try to put gloss on
Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC leaders yesterday drew up a list of ideas aimed at selling the Maastricht
treaty to the sceptical citizens of Europe.
In contrite mood, the heads of government acknowledged that the EC had
failed to explain in simple language what it was doing and why.
The British presidency and the European Commission jointly presented
proposals which combine pledges for more openness in EC affairs and a new
emphasis on 'subsidiarity' - devolving decision-making to the lowest
appropriate level.
They include a mixture of window-dressing and repackaged versions of
existing practice, emphasising, in the words of Prime Minister John Major's
spokesman, 'the human face of Maastricht':
The introduction of British-style Green Papers inviting public comment on
proposed EC legislation. Though this is current practice, British officials
said the UK wanted more formal, open procedures.
A plan by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to send individual
Commissioners to national parliaments to explain the Commission's annual
work plans. Thus a Spaniard might appear before the House of Commons, and a
Frenchman might appear before the Danish Folketing.
Britain would like partially to open up EC foreign ministers' sessions to
the public. particularly during policy debates.
In his presentation on subsidiarity, Mr Delors avoided examples of where the
Commission had overstepped the mark. He opposed repealing existing
legislation, declaring that the body of EC law and existing treaties - the
acquis communautaire - must not be affected by the subsidiarity campaign.
Mr Delors argued that subsidiarity did not mean 'cutting back' the powers of
the Commission. He also noted that the Commission was becoming less active
now that laws for the creation of a single market were virtually complete.
The UK, which has criticised the Commission for poking unnecessarily into
national nooks and crannies, yesterday agreed with Mr Delors that there
should be no change in the institutional balance of power in Brussels.
This was viewed partly as a response to fears among smaller states that
Britain, France and Germany were seeking to grab power at the expense of the
Commission, their traditional protector.
Mr Delors intends to put forward 10-20 examples of Commission proposals
which do not pass the test of subsidiarity. These could be scrapped as part
of the Community's collective mea culpa.
But ministers warned yesterday that final decisions on new working
procedures and criteria for subsidiarity would be held up until the EC
summit in Edinburgh in December.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Declaration seeks 'a Community close
to its citizens'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following is the text of the declaration from the Birmingham summit:
1. We reaffirm our commitment to the Maastricht Treaty: We need to ratify it
to make progress towards European Union if the Community is to remain an
anchor of stability in a rapidly changing continent, building on its success
over the last quarter of a century.
2. As a Community of democracies, we can only move forward with the support
of our citizens. We are determined to respond to the concerns raised in the
recent public debate. We must:
Demonstrate to our citizens the benefits of the Community and the Maastricht
Treaty.
Make the Community more open, to ensure a better informed public debate on
its activities.
Respect the history, culture and traditions of individual nations, with a
clearer understanding of what member states should do and what needs to be
done by the Community.
Make clear that citizenship of the union brings our citizens additional
rights and protection without in any way taking the place of their national
citizenship.
3. Foreign ministers will suggest ways, before the Edinburgh European
Council, of opening up the work of the Community's institutions, including
the possibility of some open council discussion - for example on future work
programmes. We welcome the Commission's offer to consult more widely before
proposing legislation, which could include consultation with all the member
states and a more systematic use of consultation documents (Green Papers).
We ask the Commission to complete by early next year its work on improving
public access to the information available to it and to other Community
institutions. We want Community legislation to become simpler and clearer.
4. We stress the European Parliament's important role in the democratic life
of the Community and we welcome the growing contacts between national
parliaments and the European Parliament. We reaffirm that national
parliaments should be more closely involved in the Community's activities.
We shall discuss this with our parliaments. We welcome the Commission's
readiness to respond positively to requests from national parliaments for
explanations of its proposals. We underline the importance we attach to the
Conference of Parliaments and to the Committee of the Regions.
5. We reaffirm that decisions must be taken as closely as possible to the
citizen. Greater unity can be achieved without excessive centralisation. It
is for each member state to decide how its power should be exercised
domestically. The Community can only act where member states have given it
the power to do so in the treaties. Action at the Community level should
happen only when proper and necessary: The Maastricht Treaty provides the
right framework and objectives for this. Bringing to life this principle -
'subsidiarity', or 'nearness' - is essential if the Community is to develop
with the support of its citizens. We look forward to decisions at Edinburgh
on the basis of reports on:
Adapting the Council's procedures and practices, as the Commission for its
part has already done, so that the principle becomes an integral part of the
Community's decision-making, as the Maastricht Treaty requires.
Guidelines for applying the principle in practice, for instance by using the
lightest form of legislation, with maximum freedom for member states on how
best to achieve the objective in question. Community legislation must be
implemented and enforced effectively, and without interfering unnecessarily
in the daily life of our citizens.
We shall also have a look at the first fruits of the Commission's review of
past Community legislation with examples.
6. Making this principle work should be a priority for all the Community
institutions without affecting the balance between them. We will seek an
agreement about this with the European Parliament.
7. The Maastricht Treaty will bring direct benefits to individual citizens.
All of us - Council, Commission and Parliament - must do more to make this
clear.
8. The European Council, in conformity with the responsibilities given to it
by the Treaty, will ensure that the fundamental principles of the European
Union will be fully observed.
Heads of state and government agreed that member states face common economic
challenges, and were concerned at lower growth and increasing unemployment.
Strong co-ordination at the Community level will help to ensure that the
economy of each member state is strengthened by the success of other member
states. It is important for member states to continue policies to reduce
inflation; to carry through programmes for controlling budget deficits; and
to improve the efficiency of their economies through open market policies.
Firm and sustained implementation of these policies establishes the basis
for recovery, for social and economic cohesion, and for the creation of the
new and lasting jobs that are needed.
The European Council underlined the importance in this context of
reinforcing the convergence process among the member states' economies,
which is crucial for maintaining monetary stability and for creating the
framework for sustainable growth and rising employment. Strict adherence to
the principles of sound economic management, as set out in convergence
programmes, formulated by member states so as to fulfil the criteria set out
in the Maastricht Treaty in order to realise the movement towards economic
and monetary union, would enable the Community to meet its objective of
proceeding together in its development. The European Council reiterated too
its commitment to the European Monetary System as a key factor of economic
stability and prosperity in Europe.
The European Council endorsed the view of economic and finance ministers
that the recent financial turbulence calls for reflection and analysis in
the light of developments in capital markets and in the European and world
monetary systems. They invited economic and finance ministers, assisted by
the Monetary Committee, with the involvement of the Commission to carry this
work forward, with the central bank governors. It should cover recent
economic and financial developments within Europe and in the major
industrialised countries as well as the implications of changes in the
general economic and financial environment in recent years, notably the
impact of the increasing size and sophistication of financial markets and
greater capital liberalisation.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Not so much a summit, more a molehill
 -Summit Diary
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, DAVID GARDNER and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH subsidiarity the main dish on the summit menu, the prospects of firing
the public's rapidly waning enthusiasm for the Maastricht treaty were always
slim.
Even non-British journalists and delegates showed more interest in Mr John
Major's domestic problems than in the agenda of a meeting billed from the
outset as only an hors d'oeuvre to the full-scale European summit in
Edinburgh at the end of the year.
The Birmingham Post, in spite of a laudable attempt to mark a great European
occasion by printing its whole front page in French, could not suppress its
normal journalistic instincts. 'Assault on the summit,' its headline
screamed. 'Confrontation avec les mineurs a Birmingham.' That put things in
perspective.
Mr Gus O'Donnell, the British prime minister's long-suffering spokesman, set
the tone for the discussions on the Community's future by instituting
two-speed press briefings: the first, in his capacity as spokesman for the
UK presidency, on the discussions in the conference hall, followed
immediately by a briefing on the latest breathtaking political and economic
developments in Britain.
Sympathy was expressed for the British prime minister in his troublesome
task of trying to persuade the House of Commons to ratify the Maastricht
treaty. But there were clearly limits to the altruism of the other leaders.
Spain was prepared 'to throw a life-belt to a drowning John Major, but not
to jump in the water to save him,' Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime
minister was overheard to say.
Indeed, the Spaniards, themselves facing dire financial difficulties as the
result of the recent turbulence on the foreign exchange markets, were
clearly in fatalistic mood. Normally, senior Spanish civil servants prepare
a list of thorny issues for their prime minister attending a summit known as
'the minefield'. This time, perhaps because of the unfortunate connotation
for Mr Major, they didn't bother.
At times, the discussions took on a distinctly fruity flavour. Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, always something of a card,
presented Mr Major with a Danish 'Ingrid Maria' apple, which apparently does
not meet EC export specifications because it is too small. 'An apple a day
keeps the Commission away,' he quipped.
Meanwhile, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Gonzalez were talking
about the Community's classification and denomination of apricots, which
prompted one bystander to ask, sotto voce: 'Is Maastricht a lemon?'
President Francois Mitterrand of France did not miss much by turning up late
for the meeting, as is his custom. And Mr Gonzalez appeared to sum up the
mood of the occasion by remarking testily: 'Given that these seats are so
uncomfortable, this should be a short meeting.' It was.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Kohl overflows with optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, last night was optimistic about
almost everything - even about Mr John Major.
At his post-summit press conference, Mr Kohl kept up the insistent bonhomie
he had shown when, on arriving in Birmingham on Thursday evening, he shook
hands with bystanders outside the conference hotel.
Running through a large selection of his favourite metaphors, the chancellor
said common resolve to ratify the Maastricht Treaty showed 'everyone wants
the European train to press on'.
He brushed aside the possibility of a points failure sparked off by British
or Danish recalcitrance. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish
prime minister, had left any doubt about their fundamental support for the
treaty. 'The Danes do not want the train to go without them.'
Asked about Mr Major's domestic political travails, Mr Kohl responded: 'I
have no doubt that my friend John Major will overcome (his domestic
troubles).' The prime minister would simply need to show the same
persistence as the chancellor himself had often displayed, Mr Kohl said.
Mr Kohl could not resist putting an optimistic gloss on all the other summit
questions.
He made optimistic noises about the outlook for German interest rate cuts.
He said the deliberations on Gatt showed 'the outlook for a successful
conclusion has improved'.
He was even sanguine about the Bundestag's decision to reserve for itself
the last word on European monetary union in 1996 or 1998. This step counters
the 'automaticity' on monetary union Mr Kohl originally wanted to build into
the treaty.
But, at his most Panglossian, the chancellor declared it was 'self evident'
that, for such a 'decisive step', parliament should have the final say.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: France sees dollar rate asblock to
Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday argued that a Uruguay Round world trade agreement could not
be concluded until the European Community and the US factored into their
negotiations the effects of the devalued dollar on farm trade, the main
obstacle to a deal.
'The fall in the dollar has been a formidable stimulus to American exports,'
said Ms Elizabeth Guigou, French minister for Europe, adding that 'we cannot
negotiate trade in abstraction from exchange rates.'
EC leaders at the summit, increasingly irritated with French obstruction of
a Gatt agreement, nevertheless reconfirmed the Commission's mandate to
conclude a deal soon on behalf of the Community.
The risk was that France's opposition to any cutback in its lucrative
exports of subsidised cereals might unravel those agreements on farm trade
reached in EC-US talks at the beginning of this week, conducted by senior
Commission officials.
These agreements forced French officials to admit privately this week that
this May's radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) - the
underpinning of the Gatt farm talks - would not work or be adhered to.
The CAP reform, which France, along with its partners, signed up to, commits
the EC to deeper cuts on subsidised food exports than the EC would have to
undertake under the worst outcome of the Gatt negotiations. French
officials, however, have made clear in private that the powerful Paris
agriculture bureaucracy does not take the CAP reform projections seriously.
Under the revamped CAP, EC cereals production would fall from 180m tonnes to
164m tonnes, with subsidised exports falling from 33m tonnes to 19m tonnes
over three years. The maximum Gatt commitment of a cut of 24 per cent in
subsidised cereals exports would still allow the EC to export 23.5m tonnes
in six years' time.
A senior French official at the European Commission, reconfirming on
Thursday that these figures remain acc-urate, explained the inconsistency in
France's position with the remark that 'it is an emotional question'.
He said, however, that the fall in the dollar was 'the only serious problem
to analyse'. Dollar depreciation not only makes US exports more competitive,
but because farm trade is denominated in dollars, adds to the cost of the
CAP in the EC budget.
There is some sympathy for France's new line of defence on the dollar.
Indeed, US lobbyists opposed to the Uruguay round settlement have also
raised concerns over currency movements as they influence world trade.
But there is no sympathy at all for France's obstruction of a Gatt deal
which all its EC partners believe could inject desperately needed confidence
into the depressed world economy.
'It is clear that France never really intended to comply with CAP reform,'
one senior Commission official said on Thursday.
'They don't care about the dollar,' a German diplomat said angrily
yesterday, 'they're only worried about their internal political situation.'
However, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, minister of state for European affairs,
said there could be no question of bringing pressure on anybody until the
Commission came up with a package of negotiated agreements for member states
to judge.
Mr Frans Andriessen, who yesterday brought the leaders up to date on the
state of the Gatt negotiations, insisted that the Uruguay Round farm trade
obligations were well within what had already been agreed on Cap reform, and
would help conserve the EC farm regime, according to one of his aides.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Deliberations cut little ice in
Ladywood - David Marsh finds scant interest in the Community among the
people of Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the people of Ladywood, yesterday's summit might have been taking place
on another planet. The sprawling 1960s council estate lies in the shadow of
the glittering Birmingham International Convention Centre, the summit venue,
and the 5,000 people who live there seemed more concerned about jobs and the
next Giro cheque than the intricacies of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Richard Tetlow, 50, the vicar of St John's church, said Birmingham city
council had ploughed considerable effort and money into the area since work
started on the Pounds 180m convention centre in the late 1980s.
'The council has now started to take Ladywood seriously. There are all
manner of schemes to help local people improve their situation.' Yet he says
the residents - 90 per cent in council homes, roughly 70 per cent depending
on housing benefit - have a strong sense of living in a divided nation.
The number of people genuinely in need calling at his door has increased in
the last two years. The church runs a fund allowing the vicar to give them
up to Pounds 2 at a time.
While the conference centre has improved Birmingham's image, it also
exemplifies gaps in society, Mr Telow says: 'If people have the sense that
others are doing better, this builds up a feeling of injustice which
destroys a sense of community.'
Mr Rod Parry, headteacher at the local junior school, felt the summit was 'a
bit of a farce'. Governments had to steer between acting for the good of
their own people and co-operating for the benefit of all. However, with
economic times getting tougher, 'they're turning their backs on
co-operation'.
Ms Karen Smythe, who helps run the Ladywood Community Business Centre, says
the spin-off of conference centre jobs for the estate has been small.
Although some residents have found casual work helping with catering and
security at Pounds 3.50 an hour, permanent employment in the centre has been
hard to come by. As for the general feeling of local people, she comments,
'I have not heard favourable responses. Most people say it's a load of
politicians talking a load of rubbish.'
This view is echoed by butcher Mr Michael Gourley. 'It's irrelevant,' he
said. He advises the summiteers to concentrate on achieving a breakthrough
in the Gatt talks 'to get things moving.'
Mrs Brenda Edwards, manageress of an off-licence, said the summit was a
complete waste of time. 'They should get off their backsides and get the
country on its feet.' Despite the recession, alcohol sales were holding up
reasonably well, she said. 'People are drowning their sorrows. They get fed
up being at home all day.'
Shopkeeper Mr John Wainwright said the summit was an irritant. He thinks
Britain should have stuck to the Commonwealth. 'Now we have to turn to
Europe. And I can't see them being very helpful. Whenever there's a
contretemps, they kick you in the teeth. The French have got problems with
farmers and the Germans have got us over a barrel on the money side.'
Business is so bad he says he is thinking of closing down. Just one sign
that, as they echo down to Ladywood, that yesterday's Birmingham
declarations will have a distinctly hollow sound.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Community agrees to hasten aid to
former Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders agreed last night to speed up their help to the
hundreds of thousands of people in the former Yugoslavia facing death and
starvation as winter approaches.
A draft declaration to be adopted by the 12 heads of government underlined
the importance of providing winter shelter and of ensuring the delivery of
relief supplies. It said Ecu213m (Pounds 167m) of EC aid was ready for
immediate disbursement. This includes 120,000 tons of food, medicines,
shelter and 40 trucks.
Member states said they would immediately provide further staff and
resources, practical and financial, to strengthen the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees' capacity in the region. The Community would also
immediately establish a task force to support the efforts of UNHCR to
deliver humanitarian aid.
In order to increase the effectiveness of such humanitarian assistance, the
European Council called on the UNHCR to set up, next week, a meeting of
technical experts on emergency aid and, next month, a stock-taking
conference to assess the effectiveness of the operation and recommend
further measures.
The heads of government called on other international donors to make a
commensurate effort to support the UNHCR appeal and to speed up the delivery
of aid already pledged.
The summit condemned 'the continuing widespread violence and cruelty and the
savage breaches of international humanitarian law' in the former Yugoslavia,
which were now the main constraint on the delivery of essential aid. It
expressed its full support for the 'unremitting efforts' of Lord Owen and Mr
Cyrus Vance to bring about an end to hostilities.
The summit also endorsed the recent UN Security Council resolutions on war
crimes and the introduction of a 'no-fly' zone in Bosnia. The leaders noted
the recent undertaking by the Bosnian Serbs to remove their military
aircraft into Serbia and agreed, that in case of violations of the relevant
UN resolution, the Security Council should be asked to consider urgently
further measures to enforce the ban on military flights.
Stressing that international sanctions and the arms embargo against Serbia
and Montenegro should be maintained, the leaders also stressed the need for
measures to prevent the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia from becoming
the unintended victim of UN sanctions.
Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Mr Dobrica Cosic, the federal president of
Yugoslavia, yesterday called for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's
resignation, intensifying the pressure on the controversial socialist
leader.
Mr Cosic, a writer who has wielded tremendous influence in Serbian politics,
for the first time appears to have drawn battle lines between Serbia's
ruling socialists and the federal government.
He followed his unprecedented criticism of Mr Milosevic with a state-of-the
nation address in which he lashed out at Serbian leaders for criticising his
peace talks with Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Despatches: Dinner for 5,750 please, James - Brunei / Kieran
Cooke sups with a sultan but finds the six-hour wait tedious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE richest man in the world issues a dinner invitation, it is best to
be punctual. The sultan of Brunei, estimated to be worth a cool Dollars 37bn
(Pounds 20.7bn) at the last count, was throwing a little anniversary bash
marking his 25 years on the throne.
Dinner was at 7.30. At 5.30, a few select members of the international media
arrived at the palace gates. The sultan is known to be a bit of a stickler
when it comes to dress. Slept-in suits were brushed down. Scuffed shoes were
given a quick wipe. Stained ties were adjusted. The man from Russian TV
looked in need of a snort of vodka.
It was going to be a cosy affair. Just us, the sultan, a sprinkling of Malay
royalty, a layer of heads of state, a few prime ministers added as garnish.
Plus a few thousand other dignitaries, even a few ordinary people. A mere
5,750 altogether, all seated in the same room.
You either hide your wealth or flaunt it. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, 29th
sultan and absolute ruler of Brunei, is not afraid of spending a bob or two.
His palace is described as the biggest in the world. There are nearly 2,000
rooms. There is a throne room that can seat 2,000. Marble covers more than
12 acres of wall. Carpets as lush as newly-fallen snow. Chandeliers that
weigh a ton apiece. Gold that hurts the eyes. Nearly 300 lavatories.
The meal was running late. No one can raise a fork until the sultan gives
the word. We waited. The dining room was a cross between Versailles and high
season at Butlins.
'G'day,' said an Australian waiter, one of more than 700 catering staff
flown in for the occasion. 'Not a bad little party, eh?'
In the kitchens, chefs sweltered and tempers frayed. Plates of prawns
collided with sides of mutton. The meat for the meal was flown in from
Australia where the sultan's ranch is twice the size of Brunei itself.
More waiting. A few of the down top table guests sloped in. Prince Edward -
representing his mother, Britain's Queen Elizabeth - sat in the corner by
the royal serving hatch. A Thai prince smiled serenely at the ceiling. A
Malay princess adjusted a troublesome tiara.
The sultan, still only in his mid-40s, has two wives and 10 children. And a
great deal else besides. Two palaces in Brunei plus a hotel in Singapore and
another which he bought, then sold, to the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), a
secretive organisation that handles an estimated Dollars 35bn of the
country's international investments.
The sultan has a mansion in Malaysia. He owns the Beverly Hills hotel in the
US, plus another couple of houses in Tinseltown.
His father was something of an anglophile who even had a special Winston
Churchill museum built in Brunei. That has been closed but the present
sultan - who spent time at Sandhurst, England's military college for
officers - still maintains strong British links.
He bought the Dorchester hotel in London but sold it recently to the BIA.
There are various flats and houses dotted round the British capital. The
sultan's main residence is a country house situated on the flight path to
Heathrow airport.
The sultan is partial to planes. He bought his own 747 recently and has a
couple of other jets in Brunei. Then there are the automobiles: estimates of
the number of his Rolls-Royces vary between 135 and 157. Plus a whole
starting grid of sports cars.
Dinner was getting very late. There were ugly mutterings from the
international press. No alcohol allowed in this increasingly Islamic state.
Diplomats, dressed in their full regalia, perspired quietly; their wives
glowed.
The sultan loves polo. He flies in whole teams to play special tournaments.
His horses are said to have air-conditioned stables.
Britain has a battalion of Gurkhas stationed in Brunei. The sultan has his
own Gurkha battalion, made up of retired soldiers who now form the palace
guard. Any mutinous sounds from the waiting diners and the kukris might be
out.
Army chaps were the only ones to maintain stiff upper lips throughout the
long wait. They would not even taste a tumbler of water until the sultan -
always referred-to among expatriates as 'HRH' - had first lifted a glass.
It was 9.45 pm when the sultan finally arrived. The whole family was in
attendance. The sultan doubles up as prime minister and minister of defence.
A brother is foreign minister, another is minister of finance.
Sultan, princes, princesses and prime ministers sat down, stock still. Not a
word was spoken. Just the sound of a thousand camera shutters clicking.
The press were ordered back to table. The sultan had given the word. Food
was fallen on. The Russian fantasised about the cold of a Moscow winter.
'And then you drink - like that,' he said, knocking back a pineapple juice.
We rose. 'Tut, tut,' said the army. Dammit all, everyone has to wait till
HRH has finished. We escaped through the kitchens.
'You people have no bloody decorum,' said the Australian waiter, smiling. We
agreed. Six hours of dinner was enough, even if it was with the richest man
in the world.

FT  17 OCT 92 / As They Say in Europe: GATT and the EC: a French farmer
writes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'VARIABLE geometry Europe is now taking shape' is the slogan I expect will
have emerged from the Birmingham Summit by the time this appears.
The Community's variable nature arises from the contradictory views of the
members on the nature of the creature. To the British, or at least the
English, it represents 11 nations jealous of the island nation's grandeur
and the perfection of its institutions.
For the diminutive northwest Europeans it is the one place where their voice
will be heard. The Germans see it as an austere school where others learn to
be more like them. For Italy the Community represents the last great chance
to get its government out of Italian hands.
For the Iberian peninsula, the Community is a rich source of modernity and
civilisation. In Greece it is a rich source of money. But for the French it
is an association of nations freely coming together that they may better
serve French interests.
Thus in the first two days of the week I counted around 30 editorials on the
subject of the GATT talks and their possible collapse. This is a result of
further US pressure last weekend to gain fair global trading terms for their
farmers. The general thrust of comment in France insisted on the inalienable
right of French peasants to my money.
Le Quotidien de Paris posed the question fairly: 'Are France's European
partners prepared not to sacrifice the vital interests of a country which,
although industrialised, lives by exporting half its agricultural
production?'
The answers came flooding in. La Charente libre said, '. . . these GATT
negotiations constitute a great moment of truth for the European union in
gestation. It is the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty which is put to the
test because it is a question of knowing whether the cohesion and the
solidarity of the Twelve will withstand the terrible American pressure.'
Le Figaro: 'If the (European) Commission gives in to the United States, the
French risk having to pay, in terms of exports, for an agreement from which
only George Bush will draw advantage.' Apart, one supposes, from the rest of
the Community and the developing world.
For Ouest-France there was a danger of France being isolated. US strong-arm
tactics 'open the door for yet another Community identity crisis.'
Nice-Matin saw the issue clearly in its own distorting mirror: ' . . . a
reduction of either our production or exports of grain, as demanded by the
United States, would cost France around FFr10bn. That cannot be permitted.'
L'Est republicain inadvertently rendered the peasants' problem totally
vacuous: 'They are simply asking for a proposal and await a thought-out
answer to the question which preoccupies and worries them: what does it mean
to be a farmworker in a country which is one of the motors of Europe?'
The other great question of the week was 'What does it mean to have
discovered America when you shouldn't have?'
The 500th anniversary of Columbus' landfall also marked the closure of the
Seville Expo which, said El Pais, had at least demonstrated that Spaniards
were not congenitally incompetent. But it added that their creation of Latin
America had not been a howling success.
'At a distance of five centuries, it is not the model of conquest and
colonisation which we would recommend, but we must note the historical
significance of those important episodes which transplanted Spaniards and
without which modern history would be unintelligible. It is the legacy of
Spain in those countries, and in particular the common language, that
permits Latin America to project itself as a cultural community.'
An editorial on the same subject in Komsomolskaya Pravda showed how the
Russians are catching up. 'When the old world felt crowded it discovered
America, but what did America give the old world? . . . The US constitution
and Latin American juntas, modern art, penthouses, pornographic comics,
melt-in-your-mouth chocolate and fizzy drink that destroys your stomach, the
'melting pot' and racial problems.'
But it was not all bad - literature, music and films had benefited from the
rise of the US. KP concluded, 'The history of relations between the old and
new worlds can be compared to Turgenev's Fathers and Sons. The badly behaved
son chose the orphanage, but he accumulated his parents' experience and
learnt from his mistakes . . . Now old Europe's task is to try to avoid the
nursing home.'

FT  17 OCT 92 / Vukovar's reluctant grave-digger: Melanie McDonagh visits
the front line in Croatia and hears about the horrors of war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MELANIE MCDONAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER MAJIC is the nearest I have come to a Helot, the class of slaves the
ancient Spartans made from the people they conquered. He is a Croat who was
forced by the Serbs of Vukovar to become a grave-digger to dispose of the
corpses produced in abundance by the siege of the city. His ordeal lasted 3
1/2 months.
I met him in Osiek, just on the Croatian side of the front from
Serb-occupied Vukovar. He lives with his wife at his brother-in-law's farm
and helps with the work. The family all were there as he explained what had
happened in an emphatic, although unemotional, voice.
It began last year when Vukovar was being bombarded by the Yugoslav army.
'At that time,' Majic said, 'my family was staying in the cellar of our
house. One day, three armed Serbs came to the door. 'Ustasha, Ustasha (the
name of the Croatian fascists in the second world war), come out,' they
said. So we came out. My son was the first. He stood on the steps of the
house. We came out after him and one of the Serbs came up to him and shot
him in the head. His brains went over his mother's arms.'
I looked over at his wife. She had started to cry and she drew her hand down
her sleeve, to show the place.
'Then they sent us back into the cellar. A few minutes later, they called us
out again. When we came out, the house caught fire: they'd doused it with
petrol.'
'Were they neighbours?' I asked.
'Yes,' he replied. Then he continued: 'We were taken to a cellar in another
house before we were separated. She (his wife) was removed to Sremaska
Mitrovica, a Serbian refugee camp. I was taken with two other Croats to
another house. I was quite certain that I was going to be shot. But we were
kept there, in a cellar that was always under a few centimetres of water.
'Every morning, we were taken out by armed men and brought to places where
bodies lay. We had to dig graves: for men, women, children, pigs and cows.
Some days, there would be 20 or 30 human bodies. But there were hundreds
that were never buried: lying in the fields and in the woods. Some of the
corpses were fresh, others a few days old. Most had been shot but many had
had their throats cut. Some had been mutilated. I knew many of them.
'We worked every day, during rain or snow, even on our Christmas day. We had
a glass of water to wash with, every day. I couldn't shave or wash my body.
And I had only one shirt and trousers all those months. In my house, I used
to have 80 shirts.
'When we began work, there were just four of us; by the end, there were 24.
We didn't talk to each other much: we didn't trust each other. I owe my life
to keeping my mouth shut. All the time, we were supervised by Serbs, some of
them with Kalashnikovs. Once, when we had to shift coal from trucks - with
our hands - we were guarded by women as well as men, with machine guns.
'A doctor came to Vukovar from Belgrade. He examined the corpses that we
brought in and set down the causes of death in a big book. After a few
weeks, he gave me leave to visit my sister in Belgrade.' He pulled out a
plastic bag of papers and showed me his exit permit. 'I got to my sister by
train and I think it was the happiest day of her life when she saw me. She
is married to an Hungarian and her son and daughters are married to Serbs.
They were all good to me.'
While he was staying there, his wife wrote to say she had been freed in an
exchange of prisoners and was in Zagreb, intending to go to her brother's
house near Osiek. Majic decided to go there, too. 'I have bad dreams at
night now,' he says. 'But I'd be mad by now if I hadn't had such good
relations. Of course I want to go back to Vukovar. But not while the Serbs
are there who have killed people. If we ever go back, only a few Serbs can
stay in Vukovar, and even them I wouldn't look at.'
After leaving Osiek, I went to Herzegovina to visit a refugee camp in the
village of Posusje. The school had been taken over to house Moslem refugees
from northern Bosnia. There were mattresses lined up in front of the
blackboards, women in Turkish dress carrying laundry through the playground,
people queueing in the caretaker's office to ask for tea or lavatory paper.
The first woman I talked with came from the village of Korovac in Prijedor,
northern Bosnia. Her son, a serious-looking 21, came over to join us. The
village, he said, had been bombarded with grenades 24 hours a day before it
was taken. It had housed a mixed population: 60 per cent Moslem, 15 per cent
Croat, the rest Serb. The local Serbs had left to join the militia on the
hills outside to help with the attack.
When the Serbs finally entered the town, they were joined by 2,500 militia.
First, they took the public buildings: the school, the town hall, the police
station. The local Serbs went from house to house to those they knew would
be armed and made them surrender the weapons. 'Why did the Serbs act that
way?' I asked. The woman shrugged. 'They were normal people before,' she
said. 'All of a sudden, they were abnormal.'
During that time, the people got food from the Red Cross. 'But,' said the
son, 'the humanitarian help went to the churches, and they were in the hands
of the Chetniks (the universal, derogatory term for the Serbs). And they
sold the food to the rest of us; only Serbs got it for nothing. I don't
suppose the International Red Cross knew what was going on.'
The only information they got was from the Serbian-controlled local radio.
From this, they learnt about three villages where massacres of Moslems had
taken place: Hrustovo, Vrhpolje and Mahala. 'We were afraid,' said the
mother. Her son added: 'The Serbs went from house to house and they made
people sign papers giving up their house or their business. We had to pay to
sign the papers. All these people had been our neighbours. There was one
man, he'd been my best friend at school.'
The son was then taken away to a camp. He said: 'It was terrible. They took
wet sand in stockings and hit people, or they used iron bars. I was beaten.
There was nothing to eat. In two days, I got a slice of bread and a glass of
water. We were kept in hangars, or an empty company warehouse. There were
always 200-300 of us, but the people kept changing. Some were taken to a
bigger camp, some were deported or killed. It was anyone the Serbs had a
grudge against. 'The UN came once to see the camp. But the Serbs knew they
were coming and we were shifted to another warehouse until they left. The UN
doesn't see anything and it doesn't want to see anything.'
'Would you go back home?' I asked.
He nodded. 'But only with a weapon in my hand. First I need a doctor, then a
gun.'
'You couldn't live with those neighbours again, could you?' I asked.
He looked at me. 'When I go back, there won't be any neighbours. My hands
are going to be red with blood to the elbow.'
In a nearby classroom, I found a small group of women; one was holding a
baby. They had come from the same village: Biscani, in Prijedor. The most
articulate of them was Emina Mrkalj, a remarkably resilient woman of 38. Her
story was familiar: the village had been bombarded before being occupied and
the local Serbs had collaborated with militia outside. But, on the local
radio, they announced a 'cleansing.' Only suspected people would be taken
away but everyone must stay in their houses and all Moslems must put a white
flag on their roofs. Whenever they left their houses, they had to carry a
white cloth.
Emina said: 'The Serbs went from house to house and called the men out.
Nearly all of them were taken 150 metres from the houses to the market
place. The women followed - some lived close enough to watch from their
windows. We saw everything. We saw them falling, one after the other. It was
a massacre. Their eyes were gouged out. We saw the dead bodies on top of
each other, beside each other. Each of us looked for her own husband.'
Emina went on: 'After they were finished shooting, the children started to
cry for their fathers. The Chetniks came back and said we'd all be killed if
the children didn't stop, if we didn't bring them everything we had. The
children had dreadful fear of the Chetniks. They threatened them and said
awful things.
'We weren't allowed to take the bodies away. The bodies were there for five
days, and on the fifth day they brought a lorry and they took them to the
rubbish dump. But one night I went out and wrapped my husband's body in a
sheet, and my neighbour's husband's body. During those five days they raped
women, and beat them. Often, when they raped a woman they would kill her.'
The Serbs from outside came from two corps: from Banja Luka and Knin. The
worst of them were the Red Berets, soldiers with red headbands or emblems.
'They said they had orders to kill us,' Emina said. 'They called it, always,
cleansing.'
Later, she was made to join a convoy. 'We were taken to the Dead Zone the
mined area between the opposing fronts) and we and the rest of the convoy
had to walk across on foot. Many people had to. On the edge of the Dead
Zone, the men with us were taken to one side and shot, the fittest-looking
ones. Our luggage was taken from us and strewn everywhere. On the Dead Zone,
you see many dead bodies. We had to walk three kilometres to the other
front, where the Bosnian Guard looked after us. From there, we walked
another 22 kilometres to safety.'
Emina's narrative was not concise but her story was borne out by the others.
(One woman said that when she crossed the Dead Zone, she had seen a mother
and child killed after stepping on a mine). Emina was astonishingly
unemotive as she told the story: probably, she had been through it many
times before. Her mother wasn't so composed, though. I went over to shake
the old lady by the hand and she cried and cried.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Property: The rich folk who live on the hills - David Hoppit
visits Hampstead and Highgate, two historic and desirable London villages
</HEADLINE>

   THAT IT should come to this
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a McDonalds in Hampstead High Street. After an 11-year legal battle, the
hamburger chain has won the right to open a franchise on the main shopping
street of the predominantly 18th century 'village' in north London.
Older inhabitants may worry for the value of their homes, but most of the
local children, as well as the huge number of teenagers who converge on
Hampstead from all over north London in the evenings, will be dancing in the
street.
'Frankly, it's a bit of a storm in a teacup. Hampstead is not a twee little
village any more; it is a busy, cosmopolitan place,' says Duncan Harding, of
Anscombe and Ringland. 'People have complained for years that it is full of
estate agents, boutiques and restaurants; now they can add hamburger bars.'
McDonalds will open early next year on a small site that used to house a far
more down-market 'burger bar. Although its design will have to be approved,
soon it will be used by the sons and daughters of those who opposed it. But
the good people of Highgate, that other favoured hilltop village nearby, are
nervous about the judgment. 'Highgate is still a delightful village and we
certainly don't want hamburgers and litter here,' said one resident. 'We
do]' chorused nearby schoolchildren.'
The two villages remain among the most desirable corners of London's vast
sprawl. They have been spared the worst excesses of modern building and
share that most wonderful amenity: Hampstead Heath, nearly 800 acres of
unmanicured park. There was a hamlet at Highgate as long ago as the 13th
century; 100 years later, the bishop of London allowed a road to be built
over the hill. It was at the foot of Highgate hill that Dick Whittington was
said to have heard Bow Bells calling him back; and it was up nearby West
Hill that the late poet laureate, John Betjeman, lost his infant heart - 'Oh
Peggy Purey-Cust, how pure you were' - on his way to school.
Hampstead and Highgate always have been the heralds of recession and
recovery. In times ofprosperity, house prices reflect the competition
between the rich for the most fashionable homes. In hard time, prices there
are the first to collapse. The villages already were a barometer late in the
late 17th century. William Blake, who founded a school for orphaned
children, built speculative houses in The Grove to help finance the charity.
He ended up in a debtor's prison. There are many in similar financial
difficulties today. In The Bishop's Avenue, famous as 'Millionaires Row,'
local agents will tell you there are only two houses NOT for sale. 'One man
I know there has bank borrowings of about Pounds 5m but his house is worth
nearer Pounds 2.5m,' says Harding.
Richard Crosthwaite, of Knight Frank and Rutley, agrees. 'A few years ago,
there was competition from all corners of the globe for the few houses for
sale in The Bishop's Avenue and Winnington Road. All that is changed; one
resident told me recently his house was about the only one not up for sale.
Behind those gilded gates paces many an anxious vendor, probably with an
equally anxious bank manager.'
But Hampstead and Highgate will always be the Rolls-Royce of the market; in
spite of McDonalds, they retain their historic feel.
Early in the 1960s, I was with the gunners stationed at St John's Wood
barracks. Every morning, we would ride up Hampstead hill to exercise the
horses of the King's Troop. Our mouths watered at the smells of fresh bread
and sizzling bacon wafting through Georgian sashes. At the top, we splashed
through Whitestone Pond, where poet Percy Shelley sailed paper boats for
children. We loved the scenery up in the villages - the architecture, the
misty heathland, the fresh-faced au pairs waving from the windows. And it is
the timelessness of 'Ham and High' that is intoxicating; small wonder that
millionaires want to live there. But the villages are not exclusively for
the wealthy. 'We have everything from studio flats at Pounds 60,000 up to
The Towers, in The Bishop's Avenue, priced at Pounds 25m; and our inquiries
are 50-50 from international and English buyers,' says Harding.
Anscombe and Ringland is finding a shortage of property to offer its
(admittedly reduced) number of inquirers; owners, like most others not
forced to sell, are waiting for better times. The firm is selling Byron
House in North Road, the Grade II building dating from 1719 that housed the
little school attended by Betjeman and Peggy Purey-Cust. Later pupils
included Elizabeth Taylor. The house, with its five bedrooms, can be had for
Pounds 650,000.
Victorian prime minister William Gladstone and his wife stayed at Heath
Lodge, another Grade II Georgian home on the edge of Hampstead Heath; it was
occupied then by his son, Henry. The house, designed by James Wyatt, has
seven bedrooms, a fine cellar and lovely walled gardens. Knight Frank and
Rutley cut the price recently from Pounds 2.25m to Pounds 1.5m.
For those who prefer a new building, the villages offer some temptations.
Savills, with Benham and Reeves, is selling five apartments and two
penthouses in a new block at Bracknell Gardens, Hampstead. The building, in
red brick with balconies, reflects the Edwardian architecture of the area.
Prices range from Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 750,000; buyers will be able to
choose their own interiors, up to a budget of Pounds 30,000.
In Highgate, St George has just acquired one of the best building sites in
London. Strolling beneath a canopy of high trees, it is easy to imagine you
are in the centre of Epping forest; yet, you are just a few yards from busy
Highgate high street while Waterlow Park and Highgate cemetery, where Karl
Marx is buried, are close by. The developer plans to build terraced and
detached houses and some two-bedroom apartments. Prices are expected to
start at around Pounds 150,000.
Millionaires come and go, fortunes are won and lost, but there will always
be people of substance to buy sanctuary behind the high brick walls of
Hampstead and Highgate. Only one thing is missing from the Highgate of
yesteryear: 'Swearing the horns'. Strangers were required to take an oath
holding animal horns and 20 local taverns observed the custom. Participants
chanted the oath: 'Both men and maids are sworn; and consecrate the oath
with dance and draught till morn.' There is a danger that this custom could
be revived.

THOSE interested in early Victorian architecture have a rare chance to buy a
building that was eccentric even by 19th century standards: the Clock House
at St Leonards, East Sussex. Its clock tower dominates the public gardens at
St Leonards, looking across them out to sea.
The Clock House was built as the focal point of a speculative development by
James Burton and his architect son Decimus. But the development cost Burton
senior the fortune he had made in building a large area of Bloomsbury,
central London.
He was more successful developing Royal Tunbridge Wells, and in raising a
1,000-strong regiment of the Loyal British Artificers to fight Napoleon.
(Building workers were the soldiers and architects the officers).
James died at St Leonards in 1837. Decimus went on to design the great Palm
House at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in 1844. Their Clock House is on
offer at Pounds 235,000 from Fox &amp; Co (0444-450-105).

FT  17 OCT 92 / Travel: In the torn-out heart of Kaliningrad - Giles
MacDonogh takes the back route to a Russian outpost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU'RE ON your own from now on if there are any problems with your papers,'
said my Polish friend encouragingly. We had arrived at the 'staff'
(workers') border crossing from Poland into the Russian province of
Kaliningrad, the Russian half of the formerly German East Prussia. The
normal crossing is on the Baltic coast, but German coaches were forming
queues which could last up to four days.
My papers seemed to please the Russians, for they established me as a
British businessman looking to cement ties with a province cut off from the
rest of Russia by the independence of the Baltic states. My Polish visa
identified me as a writer and journalist, but I had prudently put that in my
pocket.
Crossing from Poland to Russia, the architecture changed little: these were
the same Prussian villages that are also found around the Mazurian Lakes on
the other side of the divide, only here everything was shabbier, more
cluttered: an indication of the large population that was settled here in
the post-war years.
Within half-an-hour we had reached the outskirts of the old city of
Konigsberg, now called Kaliningrad. It is not a pretty sight. A big British
raid in the summer of 1944 ripped out the guts of the mediaeval city; when
the Russians arrived some six months later they decided to bulldoze
virtually everything that remained.
Unlike the Poles, the Russians had not the slightest legitimate historical
justification for their absorption of this corner of the Reich, and this
must have helped them decide to destroy all of the remaining evidence.
My first impression of Kaliningrad was of a provincial Russian city filled
with crumbling slab-blocks and jerry-built tenements swarming with squaddies
in the uniforms of all three services. In Warsaw, Intourist had booked us
into the Hotel Patriot, but both my Polish travelling companions were
sceptical about its existence. One of them called to a teenager and offered
him a few roubles to take us there. The boy got in and off we sped.
The hotel keeper eyed us with suspicion. She studied all the documents we
could provide, hoping to find some discrepancy. A missing stamp would have
given her the right to refuse us access to our rooms. The papers proved
authentic, though, and we carried our luggage into the hall where a gaggle
of Russian policemen were watching a dubbed Spanish soap opera on TV. On
each floor the guardians were engaged in similarly taxing work.
We went out to see if we could find anything of the pre-war city. In the
main square the statue of Lenin was still in place, for Kaliningrad is the
most conservative of Russian cities. Not far away were a few surviving
buildings: examples of the heavy Wilhelmine German renaissance revival of
the turn of the century.
The saddest sight of all was the old city island in the Pregel River with
the remains of its red brick gothic cathedral. Old photographs show
Konigsberg to have been a largely unspoiled mediaeval town with clusters of
ancient buildings round the cathedral and university.
Like Paris, it had begun life on an island, but had spread to either side of
the river. Now the whole centre had been cleared of buildings and their
place taken by a memorial park. All that remained was the roofless hulk of
the cathedral and, on the north side, the monument erected in 1924 to mark
the bicentenary of the birth of Immanuel Kant.
Kant was possibly the only one of Konigsberg's sons to mean something in the
Marxist-Leninist scheme of things. There is no memorial to that other great
Konigsberger, E T A Hoffmann.
Other relics of the past were few and far between. Some of the forts of the
early 19th century perimeter wall were still standing, one of them housing a
lacklustre amber museum. I was astonished to see that the Russians had
neglected to remove two portrait roundels from the facade. They represented
Scharnhorst and Gneisenau: the generals credited with the creation of the
Prussian general staff.
Another pre-war construction is the enormous market. Russians had travelled
hundreds of miles to sell off a few old clothes, the family clock or a
rusting ship's anchor. A Swedish radio team was interviewing the market
people. We got talking. They had been to see a community of ten Germans who,
together with a Lutheran pastor, had taken over the old Kreuzkirche and held
services there on Sundays. All the Germans had crept back from the Baltic
states some 20 years after the mass expulsions of 1945-1947.
We spoke to a woman who wanted to sell three dried fish for 75 roubles. My
Polish friend teased her, suggesting I wanted the fish. She offered them to
me for 70 roubles. Later in a cafe, which sold no coffee, some local boys
tossed us half a dried fish to eat with our beer. Dried fish is useful: it
provokes a thirst for vodka.
We ate that night in the Olstyn restaurant, which is more notable for its
atmosphere than its food. Among the dollar-wielding wide boys who were
making money out of the decaying Soviet system were collections of wild
girls who changed partners with alarming frequency. One in particular never
passed our table without hoisting her skirts in greeting. Later she threw a
tantrum over the defection of one of her many partners and cleared the table
of crockery.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Travel: A trip into storybook Amazon territory - One
advantage of eco-tourism is that it gives the locals an incentive to protect
their environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIRANHAS are much maligned. I can vouch for that having recently swum
unmolested in a branch of the Amazon. It was a most pleasant experience: the
water was clear and fresh, the shore soft white sand, and the sun shone out
of a clear blue sky. There was nothing sinister about it at all.
But I digress, since the purpose of my trip was neither to dice with death
nor to escape the Costa del Sol. It was to sample the wonders of the
Amazonian rain forest before too much of it falls to the logger's axe.
This year's Rio Earth Summit has quickened interest in that
newly-fashionable form of travel, eco-tourism, so where better to do it than
in the world's best-known ecological asset?
My own excursion took me to the northern part of Mato Grosso, a state in
west central Brazil bordering Bolivia, where the southern tributaries of the
Amazon rise. A party of us flew first to Cuiaba, the state capital which
bakes in the hot cerrado, Brazil's savannah.
From there we took a light aircraft for the two-hour flight to Alta Floresta
in Amazonia. Below us, as the trees multiplied, we could see the first
evidence of man's clash with nature. The ground was a patchwork of forest
and clearings, scarred by tracks in brilliant red earth.
At one point, huge earthworks dotted with pools of unnaturally blue water
appeared: this was the work of garimpeiros, the cowboy gold prospectors who
tear up the ground, wash out the precious ore and leave it bare and
polluted. Their destruction stains rivers for hundreds of miles.
Alta Floresta is a pioneer town: wide, dusty, hot. Founded only 16 years ago
by entrepreneur Ariosto da Riva as a model community, it got trampled by the
gold rush and now looks bruised. Much of the surrounding countryside has
been mown down, a few tall, charred trees a reminder of what once stood
there. But it has a fine hotel, the Amazonica, run by Ariosto's daughter
Vitoria, where a patch of preserved jungle crowds in on the bungalows, and
monkeys peer down at the visitors.
The Amazonica is the jumping-off point for the real adventure: a bumpy
hour-long mini-van drive down to the Teles Pires river, one of the Amazon's
largest southern arms, and then in a flat-bottom power boat for half-an-hour
up a smaller tributary, the Cristalino river. Here, at last, is storybook
Amazon territory: overhanging jungle, dark, fast-flowing water, and the
mystery of the tropical forest.
At a bend in the river overlooking distant rapids, Vitoria has built a
simple but comfortable lodge in a clearing: a place of brilliant coloured
flowers, countless tree species and showers of butterflies.
This was base for our excursions. Our first was an exploratory walk through
the forest - a far friendlier place than I had expected, level underfoot,
light overhead, ranks of tall, slender growths straining for the sunshine.
Hot and midgey, yes, but we were smothered in repellent.
You learn two things very quickly. One is not to expect much wildlife. The
Amazon is not Africa. The largest creature we saw was a capybara, the
world's biggest rodent, which looks like a hog. The sound you hear most is
the whoop of a guard bird which warns all the others that you are coming.
The other thing you learn is that the soil in the Amazon basin is poor and
cannot sustain much plant life, which is why most Amazonian plants obtain
their nutrients from the air with overground root systems or other weird
devices which give the jungle its fantasyland look.
Our second excursion was to view the Brazil nut trees - magnificent 150-ft
giants with vast girths, all protected by law. The tree survives in
symbiosis with a small rodent which opens up its fallen coconuts and buries
the big pips which we know as Brazil nuts. Vitoria is trying to promote
Brazil nuts as a way of encouraging conservation of the rainforest.
On the way back from the nuts, two things happened. Our boat attracted a
swarm of bees. We were unharmed, but I later learnt that bees proliferate in
the jungle, and I tasted some delicious Amazonian honey. Shortly afterwards,
in the slanting evening sunshine which picks out colours with special
brilliance, we saw a flock of bright red macaws fly noisily overhead and
settle high in the tallest tree: a wonderful sight that could have occurred
in no other place.
The following day, Vitoria took us on a three-hour boat excursion up the
Cristalino, over rapids (where I had my swim) to a distant river island
which is home to the hoatzin. This bizarre bird is half reptilian; it has
the remains of a claw on its wings and emits a nasty smell. It can barely
fly, and its young drop into the river when threatened. It is said to form a
link with prehistory. We were fortunate enough to spot one flopping from one
tree to the next, an untidy, wild-looking creature with a tiny head.
Most of the wildlife is where you can't see it - in the river. All the time,
the water plopped with rising fish. Watchful egrets, kingfishers and herons
perched on the overhanging branches. In the evening, we drifted down the
river by moonlight, shining torches under the river banks to catch the
orange glint of crocodiles' eyes.
Is eco-tourism just a way of dressing up old-fashioned travel in a new garb?
Possibly. But my trip up the Amazon was an eye-opener. You can't help
communing with nature at Cristalino. And Alta Floresta is an education in
the stresses caused by man's assault on jungle. Victoria arranged for us to
meet many members of the local community: the priest, the ranger, the
teacher. It is a tough life which makes our homely environmental concerns
seem rather precious.
The forest will be at risk until the loggers and the garimpeiros find
something more lucrative to do. One advantage of eco-tourism is that it
gives the locals an incentive to protect their environment.
Cristalino certainly has much to offer, and it is not bad value: six days
cost under Dollars 500-a-head all in. But the return flight from Rio de
Janeiro to Alta Floresta costs another Dollars 500 and, depending on
connections, could take a day-and-a-half. It is worth doing if you break the
trip at Cuiaba to take in the Pantanal, the vast marsh with its abundance of
aquatic life.

FT  17 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: Jonathan, Sophie and the perils of the
falling pound - Sterling crises, credit binges, a huge bill - what is a gal
to do? Buy British
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY FRIEND Sophie is not usually given to spending much time pondering the
problems of ERM, economic convergences and the like, but currently these
matters are furrowing her perfect little brow.
From her aerobics-honed, Dior-clad legs to her chic and shining bob, Sophie
looks expensive. Sophie IS expensive. She lunches at San Lorenzo's or Le
Caprice, buys jackets from Chanel or Valentino.
As for shoes, at the moment she is awfully fond of her dear little Pounds
200 Stephane Kelian boots, and if she needs something new will often run
into Robert Clergerie to see what he has to offer. To some Pounds 200 might
seem extravagant but when you have Sophie's . . . well, taste and refinement
were the only words that came to mind . . . then the other choices scarely
bear thinking about.
Then there's her clutch of Prada handbags which she uses when she feels that
the padded ones with the interlocked Cs may look just a little obvious. Her
watch (a present from Jonathan on that first trip to Paris) is by Boucheron,
her pearls by Mellerio and round her groomed trim person there swirls the
tantalising, elusive smell of Shalimar. No vulgar New World sock-it-to-'em
power scents for her.
Sophie, however, is worried. As she toys with her bold and witty gilt belt -
she had rushed into the new Lacroix boutique the very day it opened and
couldn't resist it - the matter of her last trip to Paris is beginning to
prey on her mind. Jonathan had been distinctly tetchy when last month's
credit card bills came rolling in and any minute now the bill for Paris
would be arriving.
The Chanel jacket which had seemed extravagant enough at FFr12,000 was going
to emerge on the credit card bill at somewhere round Pounds 1,440 instead of
the Pounds 1,200 she had calculated.
There had been the new winter coat (oh, such a delicious shade of blue) from
Lagerfeld, the Prada shoes, the Hermes handbag . . .
Well, Sophie, take heart. Resolve to turn over a new leaf. I know you were
so hoping for something from dear Karl's first collection for Chloe but
there are, believe it or not, some alternatives, much nearer home, which can
be bought in poor old devalued pounds.
First, do try and remember that labels are very, very '80s. Try and be a
'90s person. The '90s are all about caring, ecology, quiet refinement, about
quality without ostentation. Take it from me: labels are OUT, OUT, OUT.
Scarves and scarf-print shirts are all the rage. Take a look at English
Eccentrics and I think you will be happily surprised. Luscious creamy silk,
heavenly colours, prints that are both bold and subtle. But best of all has
to be the price - the shirts are Pounds 295, the scarves, Pounds 89 (you
will know better than anybody that at Hermes the shirts are Pounds 750, the
scarves Pounds 129).
I know, Sophie, that you are addicted to subtle French perfumes - and being
a Shalimar addict I sympathise - but at Pounds 44 for 100ml of eau de
toilette and, grrr, Pounds 180 for 60 mls of the parfum it is good to know
there are other options. All the sweet, old-fashioned single floral notes
are very 'in' and nobody does them better than Penhaligon's and Czech &amp;
Speake. Look out for Penhaligon's Lily of the Valley, Bluebell, Gardenia,
Violetta, Orange Blossom, for Czech &amp; Speake's Mimosa, Rose and Neroli. And
don't forget Floris - old-fashioned, traditional, understated, classy. Try
Stephanotis, another single-note floral, or Zinnia or Edwardian Bouquet,
(Pounds 28.50 for 15ml of perfume, Pounds 32.50 for 200 ml of toilet water).
I think the prices will please Jonathan.
Talking of Jonathan reminds me - remember Geo f. Trumper, whose clutch of
colognes and aftershaves are among the classiest in the world. Extract of
Limes, Wellington, Curzon, Marlborough - nostalgic names, nostalgic prices -
from Pounds 11.25 to Pounds 17.40. When it comes to shoes I am sure you will
agree there is hardly anyone to beat Manolo Blahnik for sheer glamour, but
Jonathan would not approve of the prices. So take a trip to Emma Hope, to
Johnny Moke, to Patrick Cox. At Gina Shoes, 42, Sloane Street,
Knightsbridge, London SW3 three of London's best shoemakers - Gina, Jimmy
Choo and Emma Hope - now sell their wares under just one roof.
For the new caring '90s, knitwear is the thing - ecologically sound, so much
softer than all those sharp jackets. Here you are in luck, Britain has the
best knitwear in theworld. Take a look at Marion Foale, at Nicole Farhi,at
Joseph, and then there is always cashmere which has fallen steadily in price
over the last two years.
John Smedley has become a cult name, sought after by the world's most
discriminating shoppers as well as top houses such as Hermes, Comme des
Garcon, Ralph Lauren. Take a look at the new secondskin range - simple but
sophisticated and all in the fine-gauge wool John Smedley is so famous for.
When it comes to handbags there is a problem. Britain has not produced a
must-have number since the fashion set took a fancy to proper cartridge
bags. There are names that are high on quality but less alluring when it
comes to design and others that have sassy designs but whose quality is
suspect. For sloping into supermarkets or for weekends in the country you
couldn't do better than Mulberry. Bill Amberg (The Conran Shop has a good
selection) is another name to look for. I know they aren't quite the thing
for swirling at The Caprice but they have an appealing sturdy Englishness
that makes a nice change from your sassy foreign numbers. And once again you
will be happily surprised by the prices.
So, Sophie, the falling pound need not spell sartorial disaster. British
products may not shout so loudly as their continental equivalents but they
have a life, a personality all their own and by and large they are a whole
lot cheaper. Vive, say I, la difference.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Conflict of interest?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY EMPLOYER has never had its own pension scheme but has always had an
arrangement that, if an employee pays up to 10 per cent of his gross salary
into any reputable private scheme, the company would reimburse half the
payment through payroll.
Recently, a director who is in charge of recruitment has insisted that new
employees direct their pension payments through a broker based in a small
West Sussex town. This director lives in the same small town.
As we have a desperately high rate of unemployment in our particular
industry, new employees are accepting this condition, but with extremely bad
grace.
Is this action legal, or ethical? Can a director interfere in private
schemes this way?
Although we cannot be certain from the facts in your letter there is a
possibility that your director and/or the broker may be in breach of the
Financial Services Act, particularly if the director either has a financial
interest in the broking firm or is receiving some form of benefit (such as a
share of commission, corresponding rebate on his personal business, etc).
Thus, there might be some merit in drawing this matter to the attention of
the appropriate regulatory body.
The broker's letterhead should state the regulatory body to which he belongs
(eg, FIMBRA). If you or any of your colleagues has dealt with an independent
financial adviser, you should ask him to raise this apparent malpractice
with the regulatory body and request an explanation.
He should be able to do this as a matter of public concern on a no-names
basis - ie, without having to embarrass any of you.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS divorced in 1984 but the decree nisi was never made absolute. Am I
still married and entitled to my husband's pension rights and occupational
pension?
You should where consult your own divorce lawyer about the overall
situation. But on the more general point about your rights under your
husband's occupational pension scheme - and you do not say if this is a
company plan or a self-employed/personal pension policy - we can say this.
If you are still married legally, there is a possibility that you remain
entitled to a surviving widow's pension under the rules of your husband's
company pension plan (if his plan is one of these and if he dies before
you). Some plans allow the trustees to pay a survivor's pension to a
dependent other than the legal spouse if the dead member has expressed such
a preference by letter or in an 'expression of wish' form to the trustees.
The Pensions Management Institute is conducting a major national enquiry
into the problem area of pensions in divorce with a view to making formal
recommendations for legislation to the government. It is looking for
comments, recommendations and well-presented case histories in order to
ensure that its study is as comprehensive as possible. Its address is:

FT  17 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Reclaiming losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM an American and a Lloyds's Name, with losses on the 1989 account. I
reside in the UK but am domiciled in the US. My only sources of income
available for offsetting the losses are dividends from UK companies.
Under US tax law, the 1989 losses are offsettable against passive
(investment) income arising in 1992 (not 1989, as is the case in Britain)
and may be carried forward indefinitely against any income. I understand
that, under UK law, they are offsettable against any income of 1989/90 which
is now exhausted, and may then be carried forward only against future
Lloyd's profits.
I need to know how to reclaim from the US government the 25 per cent tax
credits on UK dividends (and any higher-rate tax which I pay) arising in
1992/93 and subsequent years under the US/UK double tax treaty.
Unfortunately, you have misunderstood what you were told about the tax
relief available under US law. The IRS will give you relief for the Lloyd's
losses against your potential US tax bill for 1992 (et seq): they will not
give you any refund of UK tax or any UK tax credits in cash.
Turning now to your UK tax position, perhaps we should mention the
possibility of terminal loss relief (under section 388 of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988). We can do no more than mention this possibility
because we cannot tell from the limited data whether you are, in fact,
eligible for relief under Section 388.
If you have no accountant looking after your UK tax affairs, it might be
that your Lloyd's agent can give you some guidance through the tax maze.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Confusing advice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM receiving conflicting advice over pensions. In 1981, I became
self-employed and started a pension policy with Equitable Life. This policy
is funded to the maximum allowed by the Inland Revenue.
In February this year, I took on a full-time job in addition to my
self-employed work, and I joined my employer's superannuation scheme. This
scheme is funded 6 per cent by me and 9 per cent by my employer.
Equitable tells me that I cannot continue to subscribe to my policy there as
well as my employer's scheme, but others tell me I can have a pension for
each of my employments.
If you belong to one employer's pension scheme but also have a second job
with a different employer which is non-pensionable, or if you have freelance
earnings, then it is usually possible to obtain tax deductibility on
personal pension contributions for the this second job or freelance
earnings.
Most of the problem areas we have examined seem to have arisen where
second-job or freelance earnings have been received from the same
organisation that pays the salary for the first, even if the contractual
relationships with the organisation are totally unconnected.
We suggest that you set out in writing the source of your separate
non-pensionable earnings, showing their separation from your pensionable
employment, and ask the Equitable representative to refer your case back to
his head office. If need be, you can yourself approach your local inspector
of taxes.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Demand for back tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Weekend FT recently, there was an article headlined 'Cash in on Uncle
Dollars am.' Under the section 'Currency funds,' it was stated that interest
can be rolled up so that tax is postponed until income is bought back into
the UK.
In November 1985, I bought some shares in the Kleinwort Benson International
Income bond fund. As requested at the time, the purchase was entered on that
year's tax return. But as income received each year was rolled up in the
form of further units, no declaration of income has been made on subsequent
tax returns.
I have now been told by the Inland Revenue that the rolled-up interest
should have been declared each year, and payment of tax at 25 per cent is
being demanded together with interest due to late payment.
First, we must point out that your investment in an offshore unit trust is
quite different from an offshore deposit account, so the brief remarks in
Philip Coggan's article have no relevance to your tax position.
One message we have tried to convey over the years is that the British tax
system is complex and arbitrary, and that there is a sophisticated armoury
of anti-avoidance legislation. Nobody should invest offshore in the hope of
avoiding (or deferring) UK tax liabilities without checking tax law
thoroughly; the cost of professional advice can be less than the interest
and penalties which an investor faces if he fails to understand the rules.
On the bare facts of your case as outlined, the Revenue appears to be
correct. (This reply is based upon the assumption that, as well as being
ordinarily resident in the UK, you are domiciled in either England, Wales,
Scotland or Northern Ireland).

FT  17 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The repossession man who boards
sinking ships - Simon Lyon-Smith tells Keith Wheatley about bankruptcy at
sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR AN owner, much worse things happen to ships than simply sinking. They
can be arrested for debts - even small ones - and prevented from trading
their way back to solvency. A main engine failure can cripple a small ship
financially in a way that dwarfs the effect, say, of a similar breakdown on
a truck.
With European freight volumes low and rates at rock bottom, a good many
banks are finding themselves reluctant shipowners. Owner-skippers, often a
romantic and commercially unrealistic breed, are tying their ships up and
walking away from the debts. The more brazen simply stop making payments on
their marine mortgages and find themselves face-to-face with Simon
Lyon-Smith, a specialist in the arcane business of marine repossession.
'You used to be able to borrow 100 per cent against the right ship. A lot of
skippers want to stop being a maritime lorry driver and be their own boss,'
said Lyon-Smith. 'It's a dream to them to be a ship-owner - until you've
been one and then it's a full-scale nightmare.'
He speaks from the heart. Eight years ago, aged 25, he took a gamble on an
old ship and made a fortune plying European ports on sky-high freight rates
in the wake of the British miners' strike. One ship became four - all on
bank finance and all old and cheap. While the luck held, Lyon-Smith seemed
to be the archetypal 1980s success story. He had gone to sea at 15 with the
long-established Exmouth coasting firm of Watts, earning first his mate's
and then his master's ticket.
His time as a ship owner ended with a series of engineering calamities and a
shortage of work for the ships still at sea. The banks foreclosed.
'Explaining to the crew on Friday that you can't pay their wages or get them
home. It's horrendous,' he said. 'We're seeing it all the time now but you
just can't act like that.'
Lyon-Smith was declared bankrupt with liabilities of just under Pounds
500,000. 'We lost everything. House, car, savings,' he admits with complete
frankness. Even amid the wreckage of his business it grieved him that the
banks were unable to obtain decent prices for the ships, which were after
all their security for loans.
Now he is a poacher-turned-gamekeeper; a 'marine repo man' acting for banks
who are often all at sea and out of their depth. But Lyon-Smith also has a
mission, to reverse the banks' simple desire to sell the asset at any price
and demonstrate to them that shipping can be profitable and has a future.
'I don't want to take the attitude that it's just another bank who've made
another silly blunder. I want to show that you can make money running
ships,' he says.
So, the bank becomes the owner and Lyon-Smith manages the vessel. At worst
the income should pay the interest on the loan and, most important, the
chances of a viable sale increase. According to Lyon-Smith any tonnage sold
lying tied-up and idle is worth around 50 per cent less than a ship under
charter and trading.
British coastal shipping as an industry is in sorry decline. According to
the National Union of Marine Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers there
were 546 British-registered small coasters in 1975. This fell to 42 last
year and, says Lyon-Smith, is now even lower.
Yet, unlike steam locomotive manufacture, this is not an industry about to
wither and die. German and Dutch small freighters still crowd north European
harbours. Their governments, says Lyon-Smith, have for a decade subsidised
the building of modern, efficient ships. If Britain could weed the
over-mortgaged junk out of its fleet it might be on the beginnings of the
road back, he believes.
'The older ships, more than about 15 years, I don't recommend that the bank
even move them from the quay,' he says. 'We've got clients in the Middle
East and West Indies that will take them as long as they're floating. The
key thing then is to get the newer units trading again.'
The analogy with houses is clear. Building societies have found to their
chagrin that repossessed homes, empty and neglected during the legal
process, have to be sold at auction for a fraction of their value. Even in
the current market, a well-presented, maintained family home is still
saleable.
Banks have been pleasantly surprised - a couple amazed - that of four recent
repossessions Lyon-Smith has been able to recover 100 per cent against three
loans and 75 per cent on a more difficult case. Lyon-Smith also works as a
consultant to vet fellow seafarers with stars in their eyes about buying an
old ship and plying the coastal trade.
'I had a fellow the other day, early 40s, secure job as a captain with a
blue-chip ferry company, high salary and he wanted to mortgage his house and
invest his life savings in buying an old ship. I hope I talked him out of
it,' said Lyon-Smith.
'British shipping as an industry is in a disgraceful state but we have to
live in the world we're in. If my experience can prevent a few more
disasters and show the financial boys that shipping is not inherently
loss-making and unsuccessful then something good has come out of it.'

FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Be sure you understand just what
you're buying - Scherazade Daneshku explores the finer points of the market
/ Planning Your Pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHERAZADE DANESHKU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO you have decided to take out a personal pension. The variety of choice
might tempt many people to give up the whole exercise; but if you are not in
an occupational scheme and do not take out a personal pension, you will have
only an inadequate state pension to live on after retirement.
When it comes to choosing, the golden rule is to forget about projections
which are presented to you and are far too theoretical to be of any use. It
is better to understand how your premiums are invested so you can get an
idea of what you might expect from different types of policies.
There are, essentially, two types of personal pension plans - with-profits
or unit-linked, although there are also cash-based deposit funds.
Unit-linked
You are most likely to be offered a unit-linked plan these days. Your
contributions are invested through buying units in a selection of funds
offered by the life company. Unless you choose a cash fund, units are bought
at the offer price and sold (when you come to take the benefits) at the
lower bid price.
The difference between the two is usually around 5 to 6 per cent to account
for the cost of managing the fund and releasing the assets. There are no
bonuses. But the trouble with unit-linked funds is that they depend mainly
on stock market performance - and the aptitude of the fund manager. They
are, therefore, considered somewhat riskier than conventional with-profits
policies (see below).
But policyholders have flexibility because of the choice of funds available,
and they can seek to lessen risk by splitting contributions between funds.
For example, if you are nearing retirement, you could switch into a cash
fund to avoid a last-minute market plunge.
With-profits plans
These contracts, which date from the 1950s, used to dominate the market but
have been eclipsed by the sale in recent years of unit-linked and unitised
with-profits pension policies.
Contributions are paid into a common fund which is invested in equities,
property and gilts after initial charges are deducted. The 'profits' are
those that the fund manager is expected to make through his investment
strategy. These are passed on to the policyholder as bonuses.
The life company guarantees to pay you a substantial sum at maturity. That
amount is supplemented by two types of bonuses - annual and terminal. Annual
bonuses (also known as reversionary bonuses) are declared each year and
added to the contributions. Once the annual bonus is added to the guaranteed
sum, it cannot be taken away.
When you come to take the benefits, a discretionary terminal bonus is added
to the accumulated fund.
The size of terminal bonuses had been increasing until last year when many
life companies began cutting them. Some industry observers believe they
could disappear completely. Annual bonuses also are falling and are unlikely
to be as high as they were in the 1980s.
Unitised with-profits
These are a new product in the industry. Over the past three years, around
three-quarters of life companies providing conventional with-profits
policies have replaced them with the unit-linked version, mainly because
they are cheaper for the companies to operate.
Unlike a conventional with-profits policy, the life company does not
guarantee a sum to be paid out at maturity. Your premiums are used to buy
units, after which charges are deducted. Annual bonuses are added to the
units.
Deposit
Cash or deposit-based plans do not have the long-term growth potential of
equity-based plans but, if you are nearing retirement, you might not want to
risk stock market investment. Interest on deposits is credited gross,
instead of net, and you cannot make withdrawals until the time comes to take
the benefits. The rates of interest paid are similar to base rates.
Single or regular premiums?
If you are in regular employment and expect to remain so you could opt for a
regular premium contract.
If your independent financial adviser (IFA) works on commission, you are
likely to be recommended a regular premium contract, mainly because the
commission is higher than on a single premium contract.
Make sure you know which type of contract you are being sold - there are
still cases where people who think they have a single premium contract
realise too late that they were sold a regular premium contract.
Commission on a single premium contract is unlikely to be more than 4 per
cent, compared with as much as 60 per cent of the premiums you pay in the
first few years on a 20-year regular premium contract.
With the latter, commission usually is paid to the salesman at the beginning
of the policy term, and the expenses to the policyholder are spread over the
term of the contract. This means that if you have to cash-in the policy
early, the expenses of the commission will have to be taken out of it - and
your returns will be much lower than you expected.
Charges are lower at the few non-commission life offices, including
Professional Life and Provident Life, and with the few providers of
unit-trust pensions, which include Fidelity and Gartmore.
Single premium contracts are more suitable for those with fluctuating
earnings or younger people who might expect to join an occupational scheme
later in their working life. They also have the advantage of allowing you to
spread risk by taking out a series of single premium contracts with
different life companies.
How to choose an insurance company
Do not let yourself be sold a pension. Pensions are a personal and
complicated area and it is important to have the best advice available. For
this reason, Don Hall, of the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service,
recommends going to a fee-based IFA specialising in pensions.
But beware of fee-based IFAs promising to rebate you the full Lautro
commission - they may pocket the difference between the Lautro rates and
much higher actual rates. Avoid, too, the advice of a 'tied' agent who sells
the products of one company. His range is limited, and he will often earn
more in commission than an IFA for the sale of the same product. In the end,
it is you who are paying the commission.
Working out the charges on individual policies is a notoriously complicated
affair because of the industry's obduracy in making its charging structure
transparent. In general, your choice must be based on a combination of
performance, low charges and good administration.
Look at the top six or seven companies over at least five years and then
check if their performance has been consistent over longer periods.
Money Management magazine published its annual performance tables this
month. Offices with a consistent performance over five, 10 and 15 years on
the with-profits side (regular premiums) include Co-Operative, Pearl
Assurance, Norwich Union, Commercial Union; and (single premiums) Clerical
Medical, Pearl Assurance and Scottish Life.
On the unit-linked side, consistency of performance is harder to detect, but
companies which feature in the top five include M&amp;G over 15 years, Irish
Life (over 10) and Premium Life (over five).
The survey shows that, in general, the performance of with-profits policies
are better than those of unit-linked policies, particularly on regular
premium contracts. But when the October 1987 stock market crash falls out of
the five-year performance tables and if cuts in bonuses continue, there
could be a reversal of fortunes in the performance of the two types of
policies in the future.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Current savings at RBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland has launched a combined current and savings
account in a bid to retain money being transferred to building society
savings accounts. The bank, which has 1.5m current account-holders,
estimates that 60 per cent of these have building society accounts into
which they transfer money regularly.
Its 'Balanced Banking' initiative will allow customers an automatic transfer
of funds between a choice of two or three accounts. The package combines an
existing current account - the Gold Cheque - with two types of savings
accounts and a sweep facility to and from the savings and current accounts.
The minimum balance requirement of Pounds 5,000 means this is a package with
restricted appeal, however, and RBS admits that Balanced Banking is aimed at
'high net worth' individuals - or those earning more than Pounds 25,000 a
year.
The account works in similar fashion to Midland's Orchard account, which
also has a sweep facility. Customers specify a minimum balance which they
wish to be held in the Gold Cheque account, as well as a maximum amount.
Excess funds can then be transferred into either Gold Deposit, an
instant-access savings account, or Gold Ninety, a 90-day account which pays
higher interest.
The advantage of a dual sweep facility is that if money in the cheque
account falls below the minimum, funds will be swept back from the deposit
account; thus, there is no danger of going into overdraft. There is no sweep
facility from Gold Ninety because it is a notice account.
The Gold Cheque account has a Pounds 250 guarantee card, daily ATM
withdrawal limit of Pounds 450, and a free Pounds 100 built-in overdraft.
Interest is 3.7 per cent gross. But Balanced Banking will be judged in terms
of being competitive. The table (top left) shows interest rates on
comparable instant-access savings and notice accounts at a cross-selection
of banks and building societies.
Those of the RBS are below most other rates on savings below Pounds 2,000
but are competitive, if not providing the highest returns, on more
substantial sums. Chelsea Building Society's instant-access rates, for
example, are higher on amounts above Pounds 2,500 while First Direct's rate
of 8 per cent gross on Pounds 50,000 and above beats RBS's 7.85 per cent.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Service with a snarl - Diary of a
Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time in many years, I do not own a single share of any company
in the stores' sector, and my wife holds only a modest number in Burton
Group.
Last month, Liam Strong, the new chief executive of Sears, announced a
shake-up of his stores' empire that will include closing 350 shoe shops. The
company's shares rose sharply and market attention also focused on other
stores' groups. I resisted the buying temptation. Why? Because of history
and experience.
Over the years, my wife and I have made some nice profits from the sector -
partly because we like to wander around shops. In April 1985, she bought
shares in Debenhams because she liked its stores and also appreciated the
12.5 per cent shareholder discount on purchases.
In July that year, she accepted Burton's takeover offer and sold most of her
newly-acquired holding at between 503p and 573p. This little piece of
history is instructive because it shows what can happen to share prices.
Even missed opportunities can provide lessons. In December 1985, I bought
shares in Ernest Jones, the high street jewellery chain, at 80p. I reasoned
that sales of jewellery were becoming increasingly competitive and that
Ernest Jones might be a takeover target. But I became bored with the holding
and, by September 1986, I was concerned that it might become difficult to
sell shares in small companies like Ernest Jones. So, I disposed of mine at
78p. In 1987, Ratners bid 250p a share for the company.
I was chagrined - but I felt also that Ratners paid too much and wondered
what else it might buy at high prices. Would this lead to later problems
(especially as jewellery is a discretionary purchase: no one has to buy it)?
So, I resolved not to invest in Ratners, although many people at that time
were recommending it.
It was a high price/earnings ratio, and visits to the shops, that deterred
me from investing in Sock Shop when it was floated in 1987. Others felt
differently; the issue was 53 times subscribed and the shares went to more
than 250p. To me, though, the products seemed mainly to be low-priced items
that could be copied easily and bought elsewhere. Apart from small outlets
at railway stations, I could not see what Sock Shop had to offer compared
with other stores. It went into administration early in 1990.
Visits to shops have, however, led to share purchases. In 1988, I invested
in Daks Simpson because I liked its suits and overcoats and the staff at its
Piccadilly store in London's West End seemed always to be helpful. The store
also was popular with up-market Japanese tourists, and I thought the company
might be a takeover target. My shares cost 430p. In 1991, I accepted 585.5p
for them from a Japanese company, Sankyo Seiko.
For similar reasons, my wife and I bought shares in another up-market London
store, Liberty: the product range was good, the staff attentive, and it was
liked by the Japanese. She has been in and out of Liberty shares several
times since 1986, taking excellent profits each time.
My personal pension scheme held on to its Liberty shares for somewhat
longer. It planned to hold them for many years, but a recent visit to London
depressed me so much that I decided to sell them for a useful profit. I
believe the recession is now so deep that spending in stores will be
depressed for quite a while.
Will manufacturers and retailers take note and offer lower prices and better
service? Recent experiences in London's Oxford Street make me doubt it.
In two shoe shops, I found a style I liked. But neither shop had it in my
size and none of the assistants was particularly helpful. Why were the shops
not linked by computer to a central warehouse so they could place orders for
delivery within a few days?
In John Lewis, the department store, an 'all-day breakfast' was advertised.
I asked if I could have two eggs and toast. 'No,' came the answer - I had to
have one of the set breakfasts that included either bacon or a sausage and
one egg. I could not swap a sausage for an extra egg.
I feel most retailers are going to have a terrible Christmas; the uniform
business rate already has crippled many stores in the south. And shoppers
know from bitter experience that items for which they paid heavily as
Christmas presents will be much reduced in the January sales.
I think supermarket groups are likely to be affected, too, not only by the
recession but also their own 'dash for growth.' Many have been paying vast
sums for sites and new stores.
Take the Poole and Bournemouth area, where I live. There are two Asda
superstores, two Safeway, three Tesco, two Kwik Save, three Marks &amp; Spencer,
five Sainsbury, two Waitrose and six Gateway supermarkets - not to mention
the Co-op, Spar, and other similar shops. Tesco also has planning permission
for two more large stores in the area.
Can the population really support them all profitably? People will still buy
food in a recession - but there is a limit to how much anyone can eat.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Protection for Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROKERS and underwriters at Lloyd's have negotiated a continuation of the
insurance policy which protects the estates of Lloyd's Names, who are liable
for losses even after death.
Record losses of the Lloyd's market had threatened the survival of the
Estate Protection Plan, which meets all claims which would otherwise fall on
the families and heirs of Names.
During the summer the reinsurers paid out Pounds 33m to 1,452 estates but
premiums amounted to only Pounds 10m. Michael Wade, of brokers Holman Wade
said earlier this month that 'renewal of the contract had proved
challenging.'
However under new arrangements negotiated by Wade, an EPP initially
underwritten by Centrewrite, a reinsurance company owned by Lloyd's, is to
be made available to Names.
Premiums range from Pounds 350 for a Name aged 45 or under to Pounds 950 per
year for Names aged 61 or over. Even with the policy the estates of Names
are liable to pay a substantial part of any loss.
For example a Name who died in 1993, for example, would be liable to pay an
excess equal to 2 per cent of allocated premium income for the 1990, 1991
and 1992 years. In addition the estate would also pay an amount equal to 50
per cent of allocated premium income for any 1989 account and prior year
run-off syndicates.
The Lloyd's Names Personal Protection Plan, launched last week, is an
entirely separate insurance policy which provides limited cover (up to 150
per cent of a Names' underwriting limit) but carries no excess.
The policy offered by Merrett Life syndicate 332 through brokers Colburn,
French and Kneen is designed to be written under trust.
In the event of death, the sum assured will be paid directly to the trustees
and will not form part of the deceased's estate.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE WAKE of the cut in the banks' base rate to 8 per cent yesterday,
rates on fixed rate mortgages are already starting to fall.
Barclays Bank is offering first time buyers a one year capped rate mortgage
at 7.99 per cent (APR 8.4 per cent). The borrower can chose the repayment
method. A second mortgage offers 8.99 per cent (9.5 per cent APR) fixed for
three years for first time buyers and customers moving home. Both involve a
Pounds 250 fee. For repayment mortgages, customers must take out life
assurance with the bank.
Halifax Building Society has been slow to enter the fixed rate mortgage
market but this week unveiled an offer fixed until January 31 1995. But
having initially set the rate at 8.45 per cent, it yesterday responded to
the base rate cut by cutting it to 7.99 per cent (10.2 per cent APR). The
maximum loan is 95 per cent of the lower of purchase price or valuation,
except for remortgages, where the ceiling is 85 per cent. There is a fee of
Pounds 250 and a redemption penalty of three months' interest.
Citibank Mortgage revised its fixed rate offers in the wake of the base rate
cut. It now offers three year fixed rate mortgages at 8.75 per cent for up
to 85 per cent of the value of the property (95 per cent for an extra 0.25
per cent payment). The fee is Pounds 245. The Gold One Year Capped mortgage
offers a rate no higher than 7.49 per cent until January 1994. There is a
fee of Pounds 145. A two year cap offers a ceiling of 8.49 per cent.
Building/contents insurance is compulsory.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHS Industries, is expected to report on Wednesday a 15 per cent drop in
pre-tax profit for the year to July 31 from Pounds 120.3m to about Pounds
102m because of slowing demand in its key aerospace sector with falling
production rates of F-16s military aircraft and Boeing 737 airliners.
Cash generation is thought to have remained strong and interest income
healthy at about Pounds 14m in spite of spending on acquisitions,
particularly in its medical sector. An increased dividend of 11.2p (10.7p)
is likely. Earnings are expected to fall to 23p from 27.6p.
Albert Fisher, the fresh produce distributor and food processor, upset its
shareholders in July with a profits warning. The shares dropped 25p on the
day to 41p and have fallen further since after it said a glut of produce
would hit profits. Analysts cut their forecast to about Pounds 60m from
Pounds 77m for the year ended August against Pounds 89m a year earlier. It
has a lot of fences to mend when it reports on Thursday.
Wolseley, the heating and building supplier, announces final results for the
year to July 31 on Tuesday and is expected to reveal pre-tax profits of
close to Pounds 70m, down from Pounds 80.3m a year earlier.
With the UK market flat, analysts will be hoping for signs of upturn from
Wolseley's US operations. Results from Brossette, the French supplier
acquired earlier this year, will be included in the second half but any
contribution is expected to be small.
Paterson Zochonis, the Cussons soap and toiletries maker and overseas
trader, is likely to report on Tuesday full year pre-tax profits on
fractionally ahead from last year's Pounds 25.4m. It will be a creditable
performance considering that one-third of its sales are in Nigeria which has
suffered a 40 per cent devaluation.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Home income victims call for higher
awards - Scheherazade Daneshkhu reports on a court battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTIMS OF home income plans are fighting for higher compensation in an
action taken by a firm of solicitors specialising in home income plan cases.
Barnett Sampson, which has 450 home income plan cases, yesterday instituted
proceedings before the High Court to challenge the way in which the
Investors Compensation Scheme proposes to award compensation to people who
have lost money through the schemes.
Investment bond home income plans were sold in the late 1980s mainly to
elderly people as a 'safe' way of releasing income from their homes. In
fact, these were risky schemes which led many couples into debt, and in some
cases to the loss of their homes, when the value of their equity-linked
bonds fell and mortgage interest rates rose.
The ICS, which can award compensation to a maximum of Pounds 48,000, is
obliged to pay 'fair compensation' to those who have succeeded in proving
negligence on the part of the broker selling the policy.
However, this compensation falls short of what people might expect to be
awarded in the civil courts. If you were run over by a car and were unable
to work as a result, you would be awarded compensation both for your
injuries and for future loss of income.
Barnett Sampson is challenging the ICS's view of what is 'fair
compensation.' The ICS is presently setting a 'quantification' date up to
which it will pay compensation. For example, clients who lost money as a
result of schemes sold by Fisher Prew-Smith, which was declared in default
in early October 1991, have had a quantification date set at September 16
1991. The amount of compensation will be assessed to that date, after which
the investors' only additional claim is for interest at 2 percentage points
below base rates.
Yet since then, 'most clients will have had to face mortgage interest
payments at 2 or 3 points over base,' said Richard Barnett, of Barnett
Sampson. He says that if this is a claim against a broker for negligence,
clients should be covered for other losses. These include compensation for a
continuing mortgage debt, stress or illness caused as a result of the scheme
and the payment of professional fees incurred in putting together a case
against the brokers selling the schemes.

GARY SMITH, the chief executive of the animation and licencing group Storm,
has sold 2m shares at 10.75p. Smith still retains 5m and his chairman, James
Driscoll holds 29.7m, approximately 29 per cent of the issued share capital.
Rugby group has proved something of an exception in the building materials
sector, having outperformed the market by approximately 16 per cent over the

board with more than 1.8m shares.
John Ritblat, chairman and chief executive of British Land, has been buying
more stock, this time the 12.5 per cent bonds. He spent Pounds 258,000 on
them and Nicholas Ritblat paid out Pounds 51,000.
John Ritblat also has bought 850,000 ordinary shares since the end of March.
British Land shares remain at a significant discount to the net asset value.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: Savers need a new economic policy, too - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BASE RATE cut may be good news for mortgage payers but it represents
another blow to those savers who keep all their cash in the building
society.
As banks and building societies cut their rates over the next few weeks,
many savers may see their gross rates fall below 7 per cent. For a top rate
taxpayer, that may mean a net return of 4 per cent, scarcely ahead of
inflation.
'Building society investors are being squeezed at both ends with their
incomes falling and the real value of their capital still being eroded by
inflation,' says Clive Scott Hopkins, of Towry Law.
With some predicting that base rates may need to fall to 6 per cent if the
government is to have any hope of reviving the economy, the problems for
savers are set to grow.
For many, this is a culture shock. Building societies have offered very
attractive rates over the past few years and savers have been able to ignore
the alternatives, especially as shares have effectively gone nowhere since
July 1987.
However, if they want to avoid a drop in their standard of living, savers
are going have to consider some wider choices.
One simple and relatively secure option is suggested by James Higgins, of
financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe. He suggests that small savers with
Pounds 15,000 should keep Pounds 5,000 on deposit and place Pounds 10,000 in
index-linked National Savings certificates, which offer a tax-free return of
around 4.5 per cent plus inflation if held for five years.
Investors can then run down their deposits at a rate of over Pounds 1,100 a
year. Since they are eating up their capital, this income will be mostly
tax-free. After five years, if inflation has averaged 4.5 per cent, then the
certificates will have grown sufficiently to repay the original Pounds
15,000 of capital.
Another relatively secure investment field for those who need income is
gilts. Many are priced above face value (and thus offer the investors the
prospect of capital loss). But although gilt prices rose 1 1/2 points
yesterday some still offer yields of nearly 9 per cent, which could look a
very handy return in six months.
Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, says that the base rate cut
'doesn't much alter our medium term view that bonds and bond funds are still
attractive. We also like the permanent interest bearing shares (PIBs) issued
by building societies and some of the zero dividend preference shares issued
by investment trusts.'
Clive Scott Hopkins says the answer for savers must be to move into gilts
and to start moving into shares. He favours three products: a Generali
Lifetime Income Bond, which pays 8.5 per cent net, and is linked to War
Loan; Barclays Sterling Bond Fund, based in Jersey, which invests in gilts
and Eurobonds and pays income gross; and with profits bonds, where some
companies are currently offering 9 per cent.
It is pretty difficult to set hard and fast guidelines for savers, if only
because government policy seems to change from day to day. After all, base
rates are now almost half the 15 per cent level which the chancellor planned
to impose on Black Wednesday, only a month ago.
But the saver needs to stand back from the current turbulence to get the
right perspective. Only a few weeks ago, Britain's membership of the
Exchange Rate Mechanism seemed to indicate that the country had entered an
era of low inflation, low growth and low interest rates.
Now everything has changed. Whether the devaluation of sterling will lead to
inflation depends on which economist you ask. In the short term, there are
strong deflationary forces at work; but the recent surge in index-linked
gilt prices indicates that many investors feel inflation will eventually
rebound. The government is certainly under immense political pressure to
abandon its strong anti-inflationary stance and concentrate on dragging the
economy out of recession.
In other words, we may be returning to old-fashioned British stop-go
economics. And past experience has shown that, over the long term, shares
have been the best performers in those conditions.
So the smart investor cannot afford to ignore equities altogether. Shares
offer the prospect of capital gain (which still has tax advantages for the
vast majority) and rising income over the long term. Building societies
offer neither.
Although the arguments about whether shares are cheap today are complex (see
Page III), investors should consider how they can gradually build up an
equity component of their portfolios. Relying on the building society alone
can damage your wealth.

Line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LUCAS INDUSTRIES, one of the largest UK engineering groups, this week joined
the sad roll-call of British companies announcing sweeping redundancies.
The Midlands-based manufacturer of automotive and aerospace components has
already started a three-year restructuring programme to shed at least 4,000
jobs, half of them in the UK. As a result, the workforce will fall below
50,000, compared with more than 57,000 two years ago.
Lucas reported a slump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 22.5m
in the year to July. A controversial Pounds 90m credit from the Lucas
pension fund, taken in the first half, was completely offset by a provision
for the restructuring costs.
Yet the group's news was not entirely gloomy. A strong performance by
automotive components in continental Europe helped maintain overall sales
and profits, despite the weakness of markets in the UK and US.
Lucas and other British manufacturers have risen to the challenge of meeting
the demanding standards set by Japanese car makers, and the UK is becoming
an increasingly favoured source of components for discriminating buyers such
as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
Lucas's biggest headache is aerospace components, which saw operating
profits slump from Pounds 65.3m to Pounds 19.1m. The company blamed defence
cuts and weak demand in the civil aircraft sector, together with stock
writedown provisions.
The presentation of the restructuring plan struck the City as a pre-emptive
strike against a possible bid. Lucas was certainly careful to accentuate the
positive and wants to maintain the full dividend payment of 7p next year,
even although it is likely only to break even in the first half.
Mustapha Omar, an analyst at Williams de Broe, said: 'Despite the sensible
strategy outlined to thwart a hostile approach, the group is still
vulnerable, because it was slow to rationalise its businesses during the
recession to protect its operating margins, and as a result is inferior to
its automotive peers GKN, BBA and T&amp;N'
However, Omar points out that Lucas's prudent approach to accounting, -
writing off all its R &amp; D spending in the year it is incurred - had
depressed its earnings and hence its market rating, thereby increasing the
likelihood of a bid.
He adds: 'We are not advocating that Lucas should deviate from its former
path, but it is interesting to note that if Lucas capitalised 56 per cent of
its R &amp; D budget - like its prospective suitor Siebe - it would have
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 77.5m rather than Pounds 22.5m.'
Monday's results caused the Lucas share price to close 4p higher at 94p,
valuing the company at Pounds 660m. This mainly reflected relief that the
company had dipped into its reserves to maintain the dividend payment of
Pounds 49m. At the week's close of 99p, the shares were still well below
last year's peak of 170p, which gave the group a market capitalisation of
Pounds 1.17bn.
Lucas hopes to raise Pounds 100m in the next year by selling peripheral
concerns, such as its fluid power distribution business. Some analysts are
sceptical that the company will be able to achieve the prices it wants on
timetable in current market conditions.
The chart illustrates the recent volatility of the stock, with Lucas
outperforming the market during the post-election recovery and
underperforming it during the recent collapse in confidence.
The high yield obviously reflects market doubts that the dividend can be
maintained next year. Yet a failure to do so could well flush out
prospective bidders. Given the shares' recent record, Lucas looks an
interesting, if speculative, bet.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: Traders prepare for Clintonomics - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO broad factors will be driving the sentiment of equity investors on Wall
Street over the next fortnight - the tenor of third quarter results from
corporate America and increasing speculation about which stocks are likely
to benefit or suffer from a Clinton presidency.
The stock market has, with a few exceptions, been in a generally bearish
mood since the start of October, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average
having lost about 100 points over the two week period.
The past week opened on Columbus Day, a semi-holiday on which trading was
very light, but the Dow Jones index showed a healthy improvement anyway. The
index continued to rise on Tuesday as the first trickle of third quarter
results suggested companies might meet or in some cases exceed market
expectations.
These gains early in the week, in part a reaction to the sharp drop over the
previous week's trading, were given back by yesterday. Thursday proved an
especially difficult day as the market was dragged down by news from IBM and
Philip Morris, two of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. These companies were hit by a worse than expected loss and a drop
in cigarette shipments respectively. It should be noted, however, that the
Standard &amp; Poor's index, a broader market measure, was somewhat less
affected than the weighted Dow average.
IBM's Dollars 2.78bn third quarter loss was particularly unnerving and the
company's share price was marked Dollars 5 1/8 lower on the day, sinking to
the lowest level in a decade and contributing to the 20.80 point drop in the
DJIA. Yesterday morning the IBM price continued to slump, this time by
Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 69 1/4 at lunch-time. That made for a stunning
cumulative drop of more than 30 per cent from IBM's high this year, recorded
last July.
Philip Morris meanwhile declined by Dollars 4 1/4 , or 5 per cent, on
Thursday, to Dollars 79 3/4 . The company's share price was still falling
yesterday morning, down by Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 75 5/8 in heavy trading.
Next week a variety of bank results will be announced. In common with a
number of manufacturing companies they are expected to produce respectable
third quarter results. If third quarter figures prove to be not too bad,
however, it will be a reflection of cost cutting programmes, asset disposals
and other rationalisation measures rather than an improving macro-economic
picture. And that is precisely where the issue of Clintonomics comes into
play.
For two years US economists and supposed market pundits have been claiming
that recovery was just around the corner. The short-term American mind-set
of these forecasters has created misleading expectations and has contributed
to an overvaluation of the equity market which reached its least rational
peak at the start of 1992.
As the reality of a painfully weak recovery has become apparent, the Dow
Jones index is running at a level more than 200 points below the average of
nearly 3,400 achieved in late July. As it should be.
Clinton has meanwhile successfully hammered the Bush Administration's
absentee-landlord approach to the US economy while at the same time offering
his proposals for a kick-start during the first 100 days of his (likely)
presidency. Largely Republican Wall Street, for its part, has become
increasingly used to the prospect of a Clinton Administration.
What might this portend for the equity markets? There is an agnostic view as
far as the deficit is concerned, with few believing Clinton will be able to
chop it in half in just one four-year term. But when it comes to his public
spending plans, there is reason to look more closely at specific industrial
sectors.
Put simply, Clinton's likely fiscal stimuli, aimed in part at job creation,
should benefit companies involved in infrastructural works. That could mean
a plus for construction and telecommunication stocks. The Democrat's
expected focus on public spending in education and health care could also
hoist stock prices in the textbook publishing and hospital administration
sectors. Ditto for environmental stocks.
The downside is that defence stocks and some pharmaceuticals could suffer
from lower government expenditure and tighter price controls respectively.
While equity investors may profit from a carefully selective review of those
sectors likely to benefit from a Clinton presidency, the bond market could
turn increasingly bearish if it thinks the fiscal stimuli would prove overly
inflationary or would send interest rates higher again.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: Troubling memories of the 1930s - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO WROTE this, and when?: 'It is now fairly obvious that we are on the
downward slope of an international credit cycle. The intensity of our own
problem today is due to the fact that we now have the influence of this
international depression superimposed on our own pre-existing domestic
troubles. A year or two ago our troubles were primarily domestic; now the
international problem is at least equally important.'
Those words come from John Maynard Keynes, in the spring of 1930. They
describe the dilemma of the Major government as accurately as that of Ramsay
Macdonald's. And they cast an intriguing light on the events of the past
week.
On Friday, for example, a 1 per cent cut in UK interest rates resulted in
only a 17.3 point rise in the FT-SE share index, because the market had a
nervous eye cocked at Wall Street's jitters. And earlier in the week, while
the job losses at British Coal monopolised the attention of the UK press,
Siemens and BASF were adding several thousand job cuts to the steady stream
of labour reductions at big German companies.
Back in 1930, Keynes was a vigorous participant in the debate - which raged
over the next two years - about whether Britain should seek to escape
through devaluation from a fixed exchange rate system; and, once that had
taken place, what post-devaluation policy should be.
In the passage quoted earlier, he summed up one particularly intractable
aspect of the problem: the way in which a UK economic crisis, caused by the
failure of domestic policies, had been made much worse by a global
depression.
At the time, though, it was often hard to disentangle the domestic and the
international aspects of the crisis, the economic and the political. Just so
this week, as headlines about the EC emergency summit at Birmingham have
jostled for prominence with those about the closure of more than half
British Coal's mines.
In the background, however, lies a worsening economic picture almost
everywhere. JP Morgan, the big US bank, has nearly halved its forecast for
growth in the industrialised world next year, to 1.2 per cent. Within that,
forecasts for economic growth in Britain's most important group of trading
partners, its fellow members of the European Community, range from a high of
0.9 per cent in Spain to a low of minus 0.5 per cent in the western part of
Germany.
Of course, though these estimates may still prove to be optimistic, they are
not the world-wide slump that Britain had to cope with in the early 1930s.
Equally, however, they offer little immediate hope that the British economy
can be tugged back to prosperity by expansion elsewhere.
Forced to rely, therefore, on estimates of the likely impact of domestic
policy, the market has responded by sitting on its hands. After the
immediate sharp rise that followed sterling's escape from the ERM, the FT-SE
index has moved sideways, closing on Friday at 2563.9, 3.1 points below the
level at which it closed the week of sterling's ERM suspension. It is still
173.9 points below the level of 2737.8 reached in May this year. Adjusted
for inflation, it has lost nearly a third of its value since the summer of
1987.
Another sign of the times is the performance of the gilt market, where
long-term interest rates jumped nearly a full percentage point in the
fortnight after sterling's departure from the ERM, to 9.6 per cent,
reflecting fears of higher inflation. Since October 6, however, they have
been falling: the 9 per cent gilt maturing in 2008 closed at 8.97 per cent,
down a quarter-point on the week.
One possible explanation for the relatively strong performance of long gilts
in recent days might be that investors were confident that the government
had a long-term plan for controlling inflation. However, since what most
investors think about the performance of the government is unprintable, that
is unlikely to be the right answer. One explanation could be that
fixed-interest investors believe the economy is now so depressed that no
amount of short-term political expediency will raise the risks of inflation.
Confusion might be as likely a cause, since prices of index-linked gilts
also rose yesterday.
The gloom over the domestic economy is reflected in the performance of the
two indices shown in the chart. One of them, the FT-SE 100, is the familiar
index of the UK market's biggest stocks. The other, the FT-SE Mid 250, is
the new index that captures the performance of the next 250 companies -
again ranked by market market capitalisation. Over the course of the year,
there have been quite big swings in the performance of the two indices,
reflecting the balance of investors expectations about whether the big
international stocks in the FT-SE 100 would do better than their more
domestically oriented counterparts in the FT-SE Mid 250.
Over the past week, the pattern has been one in which a drop in the FT-SE
100 index is exactly mirrored by a drop in the Mid 250; but a rise in the
FT-SE 100 attracts only a feeble imitation from the Mid 250. As a result,
though the FT-SE 100 is only 6 per cent or so adrift of its May high, the
Mid 250 is more than 15 per cent below the figure it reached then. FT-SE 100
stocks, many of them big overseas earners, are clearly seen as better
insulated from the woes of the British economy than their mid-sized
counterparts.
One FT-SE Mid 250 company, RHM, this week failed to do much to help the
index. It announced its response to a Pounds 780m all-cash takeover bid from
Hanson: a demerger into three parts. To strengthen the weakest of those
parts, the baking and milling division, it agreed to buy Federal Bakeries
from Dalgety. Though the demerger offers shareholders, in principle, the
opportunity to profit themselves from any value released by the break-up -
rather than handing it over to Lord Hanson - the market appeared
disappointed. RHM's shares rose only 5p to 246p, 26p above Hanson's cash
offer.

FT  17 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend worry hits Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Barclays Bank fell sharply at the start of trading as the market
became increasingly concerned at the possibility of a cut in the bank's
dividend. Turnover of 25m shares has only been higher in the stock once in
the past five years - the day after Britain left the Exchange Rate
Mechanism.
Even the announcement of an interest rate cut was not enough to get the
shares out of the doldrums. They recovered as Barclays, with most other
banks, cut lending rates to 8 per cent, but the optimism did not hold and in
the afternoon the stock eased back to close a net 21 off at 317p.
Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker, confirmed it was forecasting a
dividend cut by Barclays. The house was telling clients that the bank should
come out with 15p in February against 21.15p a year ago. The house also
believes the bank could well announce a pre-tax loss of Pounds 94m; it had
previously pencilled in a profit of Pounds 188m.
Laing is especially concerned about the amount of loan write-off the bank
will have to make - particularly following its association with Olympia &amp;
York.
ICI forecast cut
The price of Imperial Chemical Industries was hit by a sharp revision from
securities house Smith New Court. The shares closed a net 25 lower at 1027p
after the house cut its 1993 profit estimate from around Pounds 825m to
Pounds 775m and cautioned that it could drop further.
The house also believes that the dividend is so thinly covered that the
share price needs to reach 900p before the yield matches the inherent risk
in buying the shares. Smiths has taken a harsh view of ICI's prospects for
some time but the latest view comes when many analysts were beginning to
wonder if the shares were low enough to present a buying opportunity.
Mr Charles Lambert, of Smiths chemicals team argues however that there is
every possibility that the dividend might be cut and that the demerger
proposed for next year could be postponed. 'It is hard to see how it (the
demerger) enhances shareholder value,' he said. The team is busily preparing
a demerger valuation for the group which it expects to publish after
third-quarter figures are released at the end of the month.
Guinness falls
International drinks group Guinness tumbled 15 to 527p as rumours abounded
of downgrades from two leading houses, one of which was denied and the other
unconfirmed. Guinness has come under pressure in recent weeks as analysts
have questioned the company's rating in the market in relation to what is
perceived as its limited scope to secure continued profit growth.
Several houses have downgraded their profit forecasts recently. and
observers believe Guinness shares, currently at a 4 per cent premium to the
market, will remain under pressure.
A flurry of excitement greeted the news that RHM (Ranks Hovis McDougall),
subject to a Pounds 680m bid from Hanson, will demerge into three separate
companies by December. Analysts said that the plan would give some of the
value of the Hanson takeover - which most believe will presage the break-up
of the group - to shareholders should RHM fight Hanson off.
Since Hanson made its 220p a share cash offer last week, RHM's shares have
been stuck around the 240p level in the hope of attracting a higher offer.
Yesterday's move by RHM added a further 10p, although the shares later
retreated to close a net 5 up at 246p.
The Pounds 24m sale of its bakery division to RHM boosted Dalgety, the
shares jumping 9 to 431p. Hopes of further rationalisation in the industry
lifted Associated British Food, 9 higher at 453p.
A large line of stock in Dixons, 3m believed to be on offer at 199p, failed
to find a home in early trading and was then quickly withdrawn after the
rate cut announcement. The shares advanced 4 to 209p. Kingfisher lost 3 to
505p, unhinged by a placing of 1.5m shares at 499p.
Abbey National saw the heaviest turnover in the market yesterday - 28m
shares. Most of the business consisted of an agency cross of 12.2m shares
dealt at 313p and representing about a 1 per cent stake in the company. The
shares rose 10 to 314p, mainly in response to the latest interest rate cut
and Abbey's statement that it would cut mortgage rates again.
A healthy rise for Shell Transport reflected yesterday's sharp currency
shifts. A fall in sterling against the dollar boosts earnings because of the
translation effect and strength in the D-Mark lifts the dividend because of
the guilder link through Royal Dutch Shell. The stock lifted 10 to 532p on
heavy turnover of 8m.
Enterprise fell a further 15 to 408p on continuing concerns about its
imminent New York listing. Burmah lost 14 at 618p with Kleinwort Benson
warning that the company was most exposed in the sector to a downturn in
France and Germany and Smith New Court said to have cut forecasts.
Water stocks were strong as the market responded to Thursday's interim
pricing agreements with the official regulator. Thames was especially
buoyant, jumping 20 to 460p.
The regional electricity companies held firm but the two generators fell as
regulatory worries continued, along with concerns over the impact of a
possible coal strike.
Lehman Brothers upgraded Wellcome which recovered 18 to 949p following
recent falls. Mr Stewart Adkins of the US investment house raised his 1993
earnings per share forecast by nearly 7p to 50.5p and argued that the group
had strong volume growth plus opportunities for margin expansion, cash
generation and tax rate reduction.
Glaxo Holdings picked up on a buoyant annual meeting and an analysts'
recommendation. Glaxo said it had made a good start to the current year,
which began in July, but much depended on the introduction of its five new
drugs to the market. Lehman Brothers raised its forecasts to reflect new
exchange rate estimates. The shares firmed 5 to 786p.

FT  17 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG expected cut in UK base rates was the trigger for an upsurge in
activity in the derivatives markets yesterday, writes Steve Thompson.
The December contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,590 and drifted back to 2,575
during a quiet early period of trading, reflecting the early weakness of the
cash market which was attributed to a number of large blocks of stock being
offered into the market.
However, the future began to move up in mid-morning, regaining the 2,590
level and racing ahead to the day's peak of 2,655, a premium of 80 points
over fair value, after the rate cut. The market's enthusiasm was
short-lived, however, as the cash market encountered profit-taking caused by
sterling weakness, as well as a poor opening on Wall Street. The future
closed at 2,607, a premium of 11 points above fair value, currently
estimated at 32. Turnover reached 11,364 contracts.
In traded options, GEC topped the list of active stock options with 3,715
contracts traded, mostly accounted for by a spread trade involving the May
240 and 260 series. Option turnover totalled 32,364 contracts.

FT  17 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market surges after surprise rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England clearly emerged as the winner in the latest game of cat
and mouse with the markets. The latter were caught on the wrong foot by the
one percentage point reduction in UK base rates, a move which saw share
prices race higher before boiling over and closing well below the day's best
levels.
Nevertheless, the reduction was the trigger for a sharp upward spiral in the
stock market, with the Footsie 100 Index ending a turbulent session a net
17.3 higher at 2,563.9. Over the week the Footsie 100 has risen 22.7. The
Footsie Mid 250 Index, which made its market debut this week, rose 12
yesterday to 2,385.9, while the Footsie 350, which combines the 100 and 250
indices, edged up 7.9 to 1,231.3.
The session began with share prices opening easier, reflecting overnight
declines on Wall Street and Tokyo, and ahead of the public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) for September. The initial easiness in the market was
attributed to ongoing nervousness about the economy, and end-of-account
selling. The market began to scent the possibility of a rate cut in the
morning, and tended to ignore the worse than expected PSBR which, at Pounds
4.1bn, compared with market forecasts of Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 3.2bn.
The Footsie, down over 10 points at the outset, was 12 points higher at
midday, minutes before the Bank of England signalled its willingness to
allow a further one point fall in rates. The equity market reacted by
surging to a day's high of 2,588, up just over 41 points, within 30 minutes.
Thereafter, bouts of profit-taking and a disappointing opening by Wall
Street saw the Footsie 100 backtrack to its closing level of 2,563.9.
There was genuine relief in the market at the rate cut, but also widespread
caution. Mr Richard Kersley, equity market strategist at BZW, explaining the
late decline in the market, said; 'the cut is good but the way it was
carried out is not good. The key factor is to get overseas investors into
the market but it will be hard work with a cloud over the currency.'
Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull said; 'Only a madman would not have cut
rates. It should have been done earlier in the week and I feel one per cent
is too aggressive, a series of smaller steps would have been seen as
controlling events.'
Long-dated Gilts posted gains of over a point, with short sterling
indicating a base-rate of 7 1/2 per cent.
Retail, or customer, business in London, fell sharply at the start of the
week, but picked up as the market sensed the likelihood of a reduction in UK
interest rates.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Week in the Markets: Columbus Day setback for gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE GOLD market
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
likened by one consultant this week to a fighter pilot's 'hours and hours of
sheer boredom peppered with a few moments of stark terror' - has moved down
a notch.
Most of the week's fall of Dollars 8.40 a troy ounce came on Monday when
European speculators chose the US Columbus Day holiday to drive the price
down Dollars 5.05 to Dollars 345.80 - hardly dramatic, but certainly worthy
enough to stifle a few yawns.
New York's Comex was open on Monday but it was thinly manned and European
sales were not matched by US buying in the afternoon. 'The US speculators
followed the movement in the physical market for a change,' said Mr Andy
Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, yesterday.
Gold's trading range is now well below the Dollars 348 to Dollars 352 level
of the past few weeks. The market closed at Dollars 342.45 yesterday, well
below the 200-day average price of Dollars 345.50, which has bearish
implications to traders who follow chart trends.
South African and Australian producers managed to catch the market as it
came down, locking in prices at R1,000 and ADollars 480, Mr Smith said.
Fears of further producer selling are likely to keep the lid firmly on the
price.
This week's fall is partly a reaction to the market's failure to move above
Dollars 352, some analysts suggest. The pace of the fall was accelerated as
funds cut their losses once Dollars 348 was breached. Analysts suggest
further falls are on the cards, especially as Thursday saw some heavy
selling from the Middle East.
It is worth noting that platinum has held up well this week, closing at
Dollars 357.35, up Dollars 1.35 from last week when it was trading at a
premium of just over Dollars 5 to gold.
On the London Metal Exchange the rate of fall in base metals prices has
slowed, although nickel and tin have been continuing headlong on the
downward path.
LME warehouse stocks of nickel rose by 1,440 tonnes on Monday and by 1,878
tonnes on Thursday, taking the total to a record 52,728 tonnes. A year ago
stocks were 8,604 tonnes and two years ago just 3,240 tonnes.
Most of the nickel pouring into LME warehouses is thought to come from
Russia, which is itself beginning to suffer from the depressed market. On
Tuesday Mr Nickolai Abramov, vice-general director of Norilsk, the world's
largest producer, said low prices and weak demand had forced the group to
cut production by 15 per cent from last year's level. Further cuts were
planned next year if demand did not pick up, he told the International
Nickel Study Group in the Hague.
The market was not impressed. 'Production cuts are all very well, but nickel
is still pouring out of Russia,' said one analyst. Mr Abramov admitted that
the country had a serious problem with the 'grey market' and urged his
government to adopt a strong policy to stop the leakage of nickel, copper
and cobalt.
No other western producer has announced production curbs to follow Inco's
cut last week, although Cominco said it had postponed a planned
fourth-quarter production increase at its Glenbrook smelter. Inco said this
week that it was likely to lay off between 500 and 1,000 workers in Canada
in the next two years.
Cash nickel closed at Dollars 6,180 a tonne yesterday, down Dollars 435 on
the week.
Tin has fallen below Dollars 6,000 a tonne this week, touching the lowest
levels for five months on the back of heavy selling, some from China. Cash
tin closed yesterday at Dollars 5,955, down Dollars 290 on the week.
Memories of the zinc squeeze are beginning to fade as fundamental news takes
its proper place on the LME. However, according to Reuters news agency,
technical tightness is developing in the new aluminium alloy contract,
centred on January 6, the first tradeable cash date. This is partly because
a grey market has been trading since June, and there is some concern that
warehouse stocks might be low when cash trading begins.
News late on Wednesday that Cote d'Ivoire had banned all purchases of its
mid-crop and sub-grade cocoa for the 1992-93 season pushed nearby prices on
London Fox up by more than Pounds 30 a tonne on Thursday morning. However,
by the close the market had settled back on perceptions that smuggling and
other measures would lessen the effect on Ivorian sales. The March contract
closed yesterday at Pounds 679, down Pounds 8 on the week.

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Buyers line up for Clarke Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of FAB and Zoom ice-creams looked slightly more secure yesterday
when the administrative receiver appointed to Clarke Foods, owner of these
and other brands, said nearly 50 potential buyers had come forward since the
receivers were called in on Tuesday.
Mr Ipe Jacob, joint administrative receiver from chartered accountants
Robson Rhodes, said several leading companies in the ice-cream trade as well
as outsiders had expressed 'serious interest'.
Clarke, founded by Mr Henry D Clarke Jr, an American, became the UK's second
largest ice-cream maker last year when it bought Lyons Maid from
Allied-Lyons. But Clarke ran into trouble missing the early summer heat wave
because of problems with new equipment.
Mr Jacob said he hoped the company could be restructured or sold as a going
concern in 'six to 12 weeks'.
Last night some 80 workers were occupying the Lyons Maid factory in Kirkby,
near Liverpool, after being told by receivers that 67 of them were losing
their jobs.

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Canadian oil restricts Hunting fall to 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTING, the defence, aviation and oil services company, yesterday reported
a 13 per cent fall in interim profits which would have been greater without
a much improved contribution from the group's Canadian oil business.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to end-June fell from Pounds 15.56m to
Pounds 13.45m on flat sales of Pounds 369.31m. Earnings per share fell from
9.1p to 8.2p and the interim dividend is maintained at 4p.
At the operating level defence profits were down from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds
3.5m reflecting the end of the group's contract to supply the MOD with JP
233 runway denial bombs that were extensively used in the Gulf War.
This division also suffered as a principal contractor in the supply of LAW
80 infantry-portable anti-tank weapons as a result of some production
difficulties among sub-contractors.
Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, said that in spite of the spending cuts,
Hunting's base load of defence business would not be eroded much beyond the
current level.
Certain contracts for which it had tendered, including one for the
management of Aldermaston, the atomic weapons establishment, could return
the defence side to growth.
Profits in the aviation division fell from Pounds 5.60m to Pounds 4.65m
following the loss of a contract to maintain BP's lazar-aided oil
exploration aircraft over the North Sea. The group has also been hit by the
reduction in the number of companies maintaining their own corporate
aircraft.
Aircraft fitting had slowed on the BAe Jetstream 31 and 41 and the Saab 340.
On the avionics side, the amount of overhaul work also fell.
The group, had however won an MOD contract to maintain the Rolls Royce
Conway engines for the RAF's VC10 tanker fleet.
On the oil services side, Gibson Petroleum, the Canadian subsidiary, helped
improve profits from Pounds 6.17m to Pounds 7.06m on sales up 17 per cent at
Pounds 237m. Despite the slow-down in Canadian exploration activity, the
group was able to increase its pipeline volumes.
The division also benefitted in the US where losses on specialised products
were reduced.

<TEXT>
Forward Technology Industries cut its pre-tax loss by Pounds 96,000 to
Pounds 539,000 in the half year to June 30 1992.
And the full year was expected to show 'we have taken a further step towards
a satisfactory profit level', claimed Mr Brian Chilver, chairman.
Electronics produced turnover of Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 14.1m) and a gross
loss of Pounds 53,000 (profit Pounds 156,000). The cleaning activity was
showing an increase, but the recession hit the welding activity, leading to
an overall reduction in business.

Losses per share came out at 1p (earnings 3.7p) and the interim dividend is

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New Cavendish Estates, the property investor and developer, lifted pre-tax
profits from Pounds 28,419 to Pounds 368,663 in the year ended June 30.
The increase was in spite of a 4 per cent reduction in gross rental income
to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.36m). Earnings per share emerged at 2.17p (0.2p).
In February the company's majority shareholder, Noro-Buckfield, said it
intended to dispose of its entire 54.51 per cent holding. It was expected
that the sale would lead to an offer being made to all ordinary shareholders
but Noro has not yet concluded a sale. The company has assisted interested
parties and the associated costs are included as an extraordinary Pounds
113,000.

Anglo St James, the commercial property developer, incurred a pre-tax loss

Last year the loss was Pounds 499,000 but was not directly comparable as St

The rental income now exceeded interest payable on an annualised basis and

Turnover amounted to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 174,000). Losses per share for the

Dunton Group reduced its loss significantly in the year ended May 31 1992,
but reiterated that a return to profitability was only likely following a
recovery in the economy and the property sector in particular.
For the year the deficit came to Pounds 803,000 (Pounds 4.45m) and the loss
per share to 1.01p (7.74p). Turnover of Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 3.24m)
generated an operating surplus of Pounds 676,000 (loss Pounds 2.5m).
Apart from property the group is interested in brick making. Those
operations had been cash generative throughout the year although output was
substantially less than full capacity, said the directors.
In property the group continued to achieve sales at or above book value.

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Brooks Service in Pounds 104,000 deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A poor trading result has been exacerbated by reorganisation costs in the
first half of 1992 at Brooks Service Group, and a pre-tax loss of Pounds
104,000 was incurred compared with a profit of Pounds 336,000.
Since the half year the work wear side continued to trade steadily and the
retail division had shown some improvement, but linen services had not shown
any indication of recovery.
Therefore the interim dividend is being passed (1.3p) on losses per share of
0.58p (1.85p).
In the half year turnover was Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 11.8m) but generated a
profit of only Pounds 55,000 (Pounds 574,000). After interest paid there was
a loss of Pounds 214,000 (profit Pounds 288,000), but that was offset by
Pounds 110,000 (Pounds 48,000) exceptional credits.

HAWTAL WHITING, which provides design and engineering services to the motor

Benefits of reorganisation were coming through and should be fully reflected

He felt the group performed creditably with turnover down only 9 per cent to
Pounds 27.3m.
The loss compared with a profit of Pounds 178,000. However, losses per share
soared from 0.7p to 22.9p as UK losses could not be offset against North

<TEXT>
THE AUDITORS of Harmony Leisure have qualified the accounts of the
loss-making pubs and restaurants group, after bankers demanded a substantial
reduction in the company's overdrafts and loans.
Hacker Young said Harmony's Pounds 1.66m banking facility, reduced from
Pounds 2.7m in the year to March 29 1991, would be extended until October
1993 on condition there was 'a phased reduction in the group's overdraft
requirements in January 1993'.
Barclays is understood to be seeking a six figure debt reduction at Harmony,
which incurred a 70 per cent increase to Pounds 3.68m in pre-tax loss on
turnover of Pounds 6.44m in the 52 weeks to March 29 1992.
Mr Robert Dawson, the newly appointed non-executive chairman who replaced
Sir Stanley Grinstead earlier this week, disclosed 'that the long term
future of the company could well be as part of an enlarged grouping'.
A number of potential bidders are thought to be interested in the property
assets, which include several well-known pubs and hotels in London and the
south east. No formal talks have yet begun.
A group of shareholders, meanwhile, is seeking the removal of the directors
at an extraordinary meeting likely to be held next month.

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Board seeks resignation of Avonside chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD OF Avonside, the housebuilder floated by Cannon Street Investments
in March, has asked its managing director, Mr Gordon Carruth, to stand down
amid signs that the group is seeking a change in management strategy.
The group said yesterday that the decision to seek a new managing director
was not linked to any misdemeanour, or the current performance  - it
announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.82m on a turnover of Pounds 25.9m in
the first half of 1992.
Mr Christopher Glynn, non-executive chairman of the Wrexham-based group,
announced he would take over the role of managing director. 'The board have
a very clear idea of what we want to do and where we are going. Gordon did a
very good job but we didn't believe he was the man to lead us,' Mr Glynn
said.
City institutions were surprised by the decision just six months after Mr
Carruth handled the flotation, which valued the group at Pounds 45.5m or
106p per share. They lost 10p on yesterday's news to close at 74p.

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Attwoods fall surprises City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTWOODS, the international waste management company, yesterday surprised
the market with an 8 per cent fall in annual profits after volume and
margins were hit in tough markets.
Pre-tax profits in the year to end-July fell unexpectedly from Pounds 38.7m
to Pounds 35.6m on sales 18 per cent higher at Pounds 341m. Earnings per
share fell from 12.39p to 8.06p but the full-year dividend is maintained at
5p with an unchanged 3.25p final proposed despite the increase in the number
of shares after last year's rights issue.
Following the results, Attwoods' brokers, Rowe &amp; Pitman, reduced its
forecast of this year's profits from near Pounds 50m to Pounds 40m.
The company's shares closed down 7p at 106p.
In the second half the US recyclables processing business, Mindis, showed no
recovery from the first half fall. An operating profit of Dollars 16.1m in
1991 evaporated to profits of Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.45m) after a slide in
world metals prices.
Mr Ken Foreman, chairman, said that a new Dollars 200m bank facility meant
the group entered the new year with the strongest base it had ever had.
Gearing had fallen from 91.6 per cent to 36.4 per cent.
The group made a Pounds 3.5m extraordinary provision to cover the costs of
fines and other liabilities that have emerged from the investigations of
over-charging by some Attwoods managers in the mid-Atlantic region. Attwoods
has now refunded affected customers back to 1981.
Administrative expenses rose from Pounds 35.6m to Pounds 44.9m partly as a
result of one-off exceptional items including the reorganisation of the east
coast operations following the fraud.
Attwoods, which has most of its US business in Florida, is expecting to be a
net beneficiary from the clear-up operation after Hurricane Andrew.
COMMENT
There was almost no element of choice about last year's rights issue - no
new money from shareholders would most likely have meant no new money from
the banks and thus curtains. But subscribers must nevertheless be dismayed
by yesterday's results. The problem is not so much the tough trading
conditions that persist, particularly in the US, but what must be most
galling is that Attwoods did not flag the potential for continuing problems
at Mindis more carefully. As it has turned out, profits have fallen off a
cliff and there is little sign of an improvement this year over the Dollars
2.5m contribution in 1992. What is more, there are few signs that Attwoods
has turned the corner. With the US flat, any improvement from the
well-managed German operation is likely to be offset by a downturn in the
UK. As a result profits are unlikely to be higher than Pounds 38m this year,
giving flat earnings of 8.1p. The 13 times prospective earnings multiple,
though a substantial discount to fellow international waste companies and
even the UK market as a whole, may well be an accurate reflection of the
company's value.

REDLAND, one of Britain's biggest building materials companies, is

The joint venture, which made a Pounds 20m loss last year, was formed in
August 1990 after Redland's original partner, CSR of Australia, sold its
share to Lafarge.
Under the terms of the deal Redland has the right to request Lafarge to buy
its remaining 20 per cent stake by December 1, this year.
The British group, which earlier this year announced it would exercise the
option, is expected to raise Pounds 40m from the sale.

<TEXT>
Sir, As the president of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, assures us
that he is in a mood to intervene in the operation of the UK economy in a
manner of his European counterparts, I trust he will not overlook Japan as a
source of inspiration.
He could do worse than first study Japan's success in restructuring its coal
industry in which employment has fallen from 348,000 at 736 mines in 1950 to
a current level of less than 5,000 at five mines. This radical restructuring
has, through government subsidy, been achieved without irreparably damaging
the fabric of Japan's traditional mining regions.
It has also been accompanied by the targeted redeployment of resources into
the development of new industries. One of the infant industries of 1950 has
over the same three decades become a global colossus. The products of this
industry are cars.

Sir, You are, of course, correct in saying in your feature on wills (Finance
and the Family, October 10) that the witnesses cannot be beneficiaries and
that, if they are, their inheritance will be invalidated. But there could be
an innocent trap in that bare statement.
Section 15 of the Wills Act 1837 not only deprives an attesting witness of
any benefit under the will, but it also deprives the spouse of such a
witness of any such benefit.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Digital's bright dawn: Michiyo Nakamoto on changing
electronic lifestyles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine on a snowy winter morning being woken up by tropical birdsong and
rays of sunlight shining through palm leaves and bougainvillea.
There is no need to venture far from this electronic paradise in your
bedroom: you can pick up the telephone and have files faxed to your study,
or hold a meeting there via a video - conference call. To keep in touch with
the office, just instruct your personal electronic communicator to forward
all telephone and electronic messages.
Such is the life that current advances in electronics, telecommunications
and wireless technology promise to bring in the not-too-distant future, say
industry executives, government researchers and market analysts.
'The world is seeing a revolution which will have an impact not far short of
the impact of the telephone and the automobile,' says Mr John Sculley,
chairman and chief executive officer of Apple Computer of the US. That
revolution will create a new industry which he estimates will be worth
Dollars 3,500bn by the end of the decade.
The source of this optimism - and what differentiates developments in
electronics and telecommunications today from previous trends - is the
growing convergence of computers, consumer electronics and
telecommunications. The three industries are beginning to overlap as the
computer enters the home in more user-friendly guises and consumer
electronics and telecommunications products take on more of the functions of
computers.
The catalyst for this integration is the growing switch in consumer
electronics and telecommunications from analogue to digital technology.
Digital signals are electrical (analogue) signals which have been converted
into binary codes. The use of digital signals makes it possible to process
and distribute a greater volume of information more rapidly than using an
analogue system. Digital signals can also be stored in a relatively small
space, such as on a floppy disc.
What makes the spread of digital technology exciting is that it provides a
common language for previously unrelated machines to communicate with each
other. Data can be shared between various gadgets and functions can be
merged. The television becomes a telephone and vice versa, computers become
both, and mobile phones turn into electronic diaries.
In telecommunications, digital technology adds a feature of the television -
the ability to transmit images - to the telephone, in the form of
high-quality video-conferencing units and videophones. The trend is expected
to encourage telecommunications services from teleshopping and home banking
to remote meter reading by utilities.
When television goes digital, watching TV will no longer be an entirely
passive experience. The digital TV set will enable users to play with
information as it is broadcast by combining, rearranging and otherwise
altering it as required. TV viewers could, for example, have access through
their TV sets to an electronic catalogue of videos stored in a central
database from which they could order a transmission of a particular film
directly on to their set.
Meanwhile developments in flat-panel displays are expected to put TV sets on
the wall. When the TV is switched off, the panels could act as an electronic
picture frame, receiving images from a central art gallery database. The
tropical jungle on the wall today could be a glittering seascape tomorrow.
In business, digitisation in the form of the personal computer has already
brought significant changes to the workplace. Computer-makers are competing
to add voice and video to text in the personal computer to create multimedia
systems that would allow users to see and talk to each other while viewing
the same visual data, such as graphs and charts, on their screens.
Pioneers in the industry are hoping to miniaturise such multi-function
machines and, with the help of significant advances being made in wireless
communications, develop hand-held mobile information and communications
tools - so called as a 'personal communicators'. Apple is launching Newton,
an electronic diary, fax machine and PC rolled into one, and AT&amp;T is working
on its own version.
The potential profits from such machines have led to the emergence of a
hybrid industry of computer manufacturing, consumer electronics, software
programming, telecommunications, cable TV, broadcasting and publishing.
Apple has joined hands with Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics
company, to manufacture its personal digital assistant (PDA). The US company
is also working with Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group, on a
multimedia player, and also with IBM on multimedia software and Kodak on
digital photography products. Tandy, the US electronics group, and Casio are
collaborating on a PDA.
The integration of industries is not limited to such partnerships. Cable
television companies already offer telecoms services in the US and UK. With
the spread of fibre-optic networks, which have even greater information
storage and distribution capacity than digital networks, telecoms operators
could link users through fibre networks to any number of entertainment
programme providers.
'The distinction that used to exist between these industries is becoming
obsolete,' says Mr Hugh Small, European director of Arthur D Little, the
management consultancy.
Such cross-industry alliances will be important in setting global technical
standards. Consumers are unlikely to want to invest in new products unless
gadgets from different manufacturers can interact with each other.
Collaboration also helps to reduce the risks of entering an untested market.
'Global partnerships and worldwide sourcing will be the key to success in
this new industry,' says Mr Takashi Yamamoto, senior vice-president and
general manager of Marubeni, the Japanese trading company.
The digital revolution, however, must still overcome several obstacles. In
particular, the new technologies will have to be tested in specific
products, which will need to pass the judgment of the market. 'We are
looking at a large number of new types of products and many will fail,' says
Mr Paul Donovan, at Apple in the UK.
But the competition to develop new products, and the huge sums being spent
in R&amp;D suggest few companies doubt the potential of digital systems.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN INGRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have read with interest your paper's excellent coverage of the recent
financial and economic events surround sterling's humiliating exit from the
ERM.
Initially, most commentators and economists, although fearing the
inevitable, were in fact stunned by the act itself. One can even include in
that description both the chancellor and the prime minister. However, after
the original stunned silence a cacophony of sound has broken out. Everyone
has a view, talking heads abound and rolling heads, still yapping, are
expected.
In the current mayhem I would like to make a point. In essence, the debacle
has been caused by the erosion of the manufacturing and commercial base in
the UK. Germany and France, countries which have nurtured their industrial
companies, have shown us up because currencies represent the true worth of
an economy. In a phrase, it is their paper. You can massage the paper by
interest rates in the short term, but in the long term it is manufacturing
performance that counts.
The powers that run Britain must put manufacturing first. It is ironic that
high German interest rates, which caused the recent problems were for the
very purpose of financing east Germany and putting it to work. Let us try to
emulate them. Martin Ingram,

FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: University/polytechnic statistics must be looked at
more closely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN IZBICKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Dixon's well-researched report ('A sad final blow for the
polytechnics', October 7) would have been even better if his interpretation
of the figures had been more detached. The recession has, of course,
affected every sector, from nursery schools to universities. Polytechnics,
it is true, fared marginally worse on the jobs market, but it would have
been wiser to look more closely at the figures.
When one analyses some of the contents of Mr Dixon's table, the following
facts come to light. The number of 'old' university graduates rose by some 2
per cent in 1991 over 1990 whereas the number gaining polytechnic degrees
rose by 14.9 per cent over the same one year period.
When you study the next category - those entering regular jobs in the UK -
one finds the proportions down: the universities by 4,150 graduates and the
polytechnics by just 800.
Finally, those who can expect an 'at best short-term UK job' again produces
nothing more than a marginal difference, with both sectors worse off:
universities by 2,016 (2.3 per cent) in the period studied and polytechnics
by 2,704 (4 per cent).
All this proves is perhaps that number-crunching and 'league tables' should
always be avoided or treated with the care. It is a fruitless task, even a
silly game, for it looks only at figures, not people. Statistics are devoid
of soul.
But Michael Dixon's concluding paragraph is absolutely correct (possibly
because he has abandoned his numbers game and returned to reality): many
employers, faced with two candidates, one from a traditional university and
one from the old polytechnics, are stubbornly snobbish enough to go for the
former, regardless of the piece of graduation paper proffered. This, as Mr
Dixon rightly surmises, is likely to change now that all the polytechnics
are universities in title as well as in fact.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Deep mine of discontent: John Major's decision to go for
growth reflects the weakness of his position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here we go again. It is U-turn time once more. We have returned to the
traditional methodology of so many post-1945 British governments: fly blind,
and back off when you bump into a rock. Yesterday's 1 percentage point cut
in interest rates, relief though it may be, was just such an instinctive
response. The Bank of England signalled on Tuesday that no early reduction
could be expected, but a handful of backbench Tory MPs indicated on Thursday
that the government could lose a vote on pit closures. Bingo: 1 point off.
Suddenly last week's protestation at the Conservative party conference in
Brighton that reducing inflation would be the guiding star of economic
policy became ancient history. The new reality is that the single question
that the chancellor and the prime minister ask themselves is: 'What will put
the government back on its feet?' (Answer: growth.) We have been here before
 -in 1972 and 1974 under the then Mr Ted Heath and, in far worse conditions,
in 1978-79 under the then Mr Jim Callaghan.
That unfortunate pair discovered that once a government is on the slippery
slope each successive attempt to save itself propels it into deeper trouble.
It could be happening again. Yesterday's interest rate cut will not
necessarily buy the votes of sufficient Conservative backbenchers, although
you can never tell how many breast-beating rebels will live up to their
pretensions when division-time comes. If true to form, some who say now that
they will vote against will abstain next week; others will change their
minds at the last minute. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the powerful backbench
1922 committee, is huffing and puffing, but will he blow the house down?
Maybe.
If all the opposition parties remain united the government's pit closure
programme could be stopped if it comes to a parliamentary stand-off next
Wednesday. Only a dozen Tory votes against the government could scupper it.
Of course if Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, perceives that humiliation is
in prospect there will be no defeat. Instead there will be a U-turn of sorts
 -perhaps an agreement to set up an inquiry into British Coal's redundancy
programme.
Mr John Major regards the prospect of any U-turn with abhorrence. Naturally.
A defeat on coal would be devastating. It may not happen. But his problem is
that every effort he makes to retrieve the authority lost on September 16 is
thwarted, either by bad luck or by poor judgment. At Brighton he showed the
doggedness for which he is justly renowned. His keynote speech seemed
sufficiently patriotic to buy him time. He insisted that he would push the
bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty through the Commons. Perhaps the worst
was behind him. That was, however, a whole week ago. Today, with everyone
wringing their hands over the state of the economy, Brighton seems
irrelevant.
Earlier this week Mr Major and his colleagues talked down expectations of
yesterday's summit of European Community leaders in Birmingham. When the
communique came last night this humility was seen to be wise. Gestures were
made towards clarifying the concept of subsidiarity. There was talk of more
open procedures - an EC citizen's charter, shall we way. Reassuring language
about national identity was used. We shall have to wait until the Edinburgh
summit in December to see whether these comforting words turn into addenda
to the Maastricht treaty. Yesterday's sideshow was at best a public
relations coup for Mr Major. It will not in itself restore the prime
minister's reputation.
In short, our old friends, alarm and despondency, have come back to stay. It
looks as if they will be around for more than a few weeks. Alarm arrived a
month ago, with the collapse of the government's European and economic
policies. It began to settle in soon afterwards, as it dawned upon the
electorate that the prime minister and his colleagues are in a state of
shock from which they will not quickly or easily recover.
Despondency made its re-appearance this week, with the announcement that the
bulk of the coal mining industry is to be shut down. This would have been an
unpopular decision at the best of times. It came at the worst of times, as
unemployment continues to rise and the recession seems endless. The nation's
doubts about Mr Major's administration have boiled over into a widespread
belief that the government is in control of nothing, least of all its own
strategies.
An outburst of anxiety expressed in many private conversations has been
matched by unprecedented public hostility from the Conservative press. 'John
Major presides over . . . a bankrupt, clueless, lying, incompetent, arrogant
administration,' wrote the Sun's commentator yesterday. 'He is weak,' said
The Times. The rest of the media, the bishops, and venerable institutions
have joined in. Politicians, who are as human as the rest of us, are not
invulnerable to such assaults.
It is difficult to say which way Mr Major will now turn. The government is
secure. The opposition has no believable alternative strategy. The prime
minister seems likely to survive in office, if only for the lack of any
other leader who could unite the party. The conventional wisdom is that he
may restore public confidence in his government if he removes Mr Norman
Lamont from the Treasury and puts in a chancellor who can successfully
present the retreat from high interest rates as a coherent package of
restructuring measures.
Perhaps. The difficulty is that there are obstacles in the way of such
decisive action. They are all internal to Mr Major, who dearly wishes to be
regarded as consistent, even when flexibility is called for. He only changes
course when forced to do so. He does not want to see a second close
colleague driven out of office by a media campaign - which is reasonable
enough. He is in thrall to cabinet heavyweights such as Messrs Michael
Heseltine, Kenneth Clarke and Douglas Hurd; he has yet to rise above them.
With an overall majority of only 21 he does not wish to risk a backbench
revolt; nor has he shown that he has the self-confidence necessary to
disturb the factional balance within a bitterly divided party.
Bold pronouncements of new directions would therefore be out of character.
Mr Major's strength is his attention to detail. He has not demonstrated an
ability to stand back and review the broad direction of his government, nor
does he enjoy sage counsel from an elder colleague, as Lady Thatcher did
when Lord Whitelaw was still active. The prime minister's course is
therefore clear. He will go for growth, bumping from wall to wall, turning
this way and that, and we will be bumped along behind him.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: Rejoining ERM crucial if wage moderation to be
sustained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER INGRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial ('Time to get tough on pay', October 15) raises some
possibilities to address the perennial problem of wage growth outstripping
productivity in the British economy. The policy you advocate amounts to a
cumbersome replacement of the discipline formerly provided by exchange rate
mechanism membership. The success in moderating wage growth in Britain
during the 23 months within ERM represents an impressive record. Assisted by
the downturn in the economy the reduction of average earnings growth from 10
per cent in the autumn of 1990 to 5.75 per cent today (the lowest level
since 1967) represents the fastest quarterly deceleration in wage growth
since the second world war. Pay settlements in manufacturing and private
services, the most responsive measure of companies' wage awards, fell from
respectively 8.8 per cent and 8.9 per cent in the third quarter of 1990 to
4.3 per cent in both sectors today.
The impact of this discipline on company wage settlements, given the high
and increasing levels of unemployment, is unlikely to be lost immediately.
The issue of wage growth has, throughout the last 40 years, restricted
Britain's room for manoeuvre throughout the range of economic policy choice.
The opportunity provided by the ERM offered the chance to redress this
weakness. The evidence of the mechanism's enduring success in moderating
earnings growth is apparent from the success of our European partners.
On the basis of Britain's recent experience, the appropriate response from
policy makers should be to rejoin the ERM at the earliest possibility.
Failure to do so would condemn the British economy to an enduring problem
which, throughout the 1980s, it was unable to solve.

</HEADLINE>

Sir, I was incensed by your article 'Engineers' salaries outstrip inflation'
(October 8), which states that the average annual earnings of a chartered

between a half and two-thirds of this sum; somewhat less than the figure
quoted for support technicians.
I do not believe that our company's salaries are that much below the
average. It is galling enough to earn half as much as our European
counterparts without having the results of what appears to be an
unrepresentative sample rubbing salt in the wound. As as for recommending
the profession to young people, I know of no one who would do so unless the

FT  17 OCT 92 / Leading Article: In the slough of despond
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PALL OF gloom has descended over Britain. The recession is deepening as
the latest wave of redundancies confirm, and market forces show no mercy, as
the humbling of the coal industry makes clear. But the government has proved
unable to offer the leadership that the crisis demands.
Simply blaming a lack of political leadership for the continued downward
slide is too simplistic. The roots of the current crisis lie deep in the
past - in the failure of Britain's industrial and education establishments
to remain competitive since the second world war, the inflationary errors of
the 1970s, the depth of the last recession and in the policy errors of the
Lawson years.
Nor is the UK the only country that is enduring a painfully long recessions
as penance for the excess of the 1980s, as Mr Alan Greenspan of the US
Federal Reserve said in Japan earlier this week. It will take years for
consumers, banks and companies in the US, Australia, the Scandinavian
countries and Japan to shake off the bad debts that they accumulated during
the fat years following the 1982 recession. The non-inflationary route to
balance-sheet health is the virtuous way to work off these debts, but one
which causes maximum pain.
Relatively debt-free Continental Europe is not faring much better. The
combination of Germany's fiscal policy errors, its impending recession, and
the efficiency with which the exchange rate mechanism is spreading the
burden of Germany's economic woes across the rest of the Continent, make the
next year look bleak for the non-English speaking world as well.
As a result, the OECD now expects growth in the organisation's 24 member
states to be only 2.1 per cent in 1993, compared with the 3 per cent it was
forecasting for next year in June.
Yet it is not true that the world is to blame for the UK's current economic
plight, however much the government wants the country to believe that is the
case.
Explosive cocktail
The UK recession has been deeper and longer than anywhere else in the
developed world, in part because the expansion of the late 1980s was
stronger and the imbalances in the economy were greater than elsewhere. With
hindsight, sterling stayed too long at too high a rate within the ERM, the
result being an explosive cocktail of high European real interest rates with
an extremely demanding exchange rate and an Anglo-Saxon debt problem.
Past errors of judgment were widely made outside the UK Treasury. But the
monetary easing that has occurred since Black Wednesday - the 10.8 per cent
decline in the trade-weighted exchange rate and the 1 percentage point
reduction in base rates before yesterday's cut - have been more than offset
by the slump in both business and consumer confidence of the past few weeks.
For that slump, the government's failure to articulate a credible new policy
framework must bear a part of the blame. Manufacturing output declined last
month, while job vacancies fell by 11 per cent in September, both figures
suggesting there is more pain to come.
Striking failure
Nowhere has the failure of government to explain its actions been more stark
than in the handling of the closure of much of what remains of the mining
industry. The closure of these pits was probably inevitable on economic
grounds. Whether it was necessary now, at the bottom of a recession and
while the rest of the government's energy policy remains murky, is more open
to question. In any event, the outcome has been a surge of public feeling on
a scale which the government failed to foresee.
Equally striking is the failure to define a new economic policy outside the
ERM. The prime minister has made no proper attempt to explain the errors of
judgment which undoubtedly occurred in the run-up to Black Wednesday. Nor
has the chancellor been able adequately to explain the government's economic
policy. His declared strategy amounts to little more than 'trust me to do
what I think is best for you'. That is why yesterday's interest rate cut,
however welcome to borrowers and even justifiable in itself, seems like a
tit-bit to pacify disgruntled backbenchers.
The markets know that economic policy with a floating pound and fragile
confidence demands keen judgment rather than fixed policy rules. The
government must balance any fall in real interest rates with credible fiscal
tightening in the longer term. Monetary policy needs also to be managed by
an institution protected against short-term political pressures, and
credible to business and labour.
An approach on these lines is required in order to re-establish confidence
in British economic management and ensure that sterling does not fall too
far too fast on the foreign exchanges. A sharp easing of monetary policy,
endorsed by a panicked government, will send all the wrong signals. Until
the government defines its strategy, everything it does, right or wrong,
will still be suspect.

closures and job losses at great British companies such as Lucas,
Rolls-Royce Motors and British Aerospace. The last recession did lasting
damage to large sectors of British industry. Can it really be happening all
over again?
The short answer is no, or at any rate not yet. Though job losses in
manufacturing are as severe as last time round, the fall in output is not.
From its peak two years ago, manufacturing output in the UK has fallen by 7
per cent. In the two years to mid-1981 it fell by twice that. Only a quarter
of the 3,300 businesses put into receivership this year have been
manufacturers. No less than 60 per cent have been in service industries. If
this recession is the worst since the second world war, it is only because
the pain is more equally distributed.
This is not to deny that manufacturing has received some hard knocks. But
not all have been primarily recession-related. Last month's closure of
British Aerospace's historic factory at Hatfield, for instance, was if
anything overdue. BAe had never made money from its regional aircraft
business. The recession simply uncovered the fact.
Again, some of the bad news turns out on inspection to be not quite so bad
after all. Much coverage was given to Monday's announcement from Lucas that
it was closing some UK plants and shedding some 2,000 workers. Less was made
of the fact that Lucas may end up producing slightly more in the UK as a
result.
The company is closing plants in Continental Europe as well as in Britain
and redistributing its output among the remainder. In the process, the UK
looks like gaining slightly more than it loses. 'The UK is a good
manufacturing base,' Lucas said on Monday. 'Some of our customers who
traditionally bought in their own countries are specifically looking to
source in the UK.'
Similarly, the Engineering Employers' Federation was widely quoted this week
as condemning the government's 'ministerial paralysis'. But it also said it
expected engineering output to rise by 3 per cent in the next 12 months. The
UK's cost competitiveness in export markets, it said, was 'probably now as
good as at any time since before 1980'.
The main reason for the EEF's optimism was the motor industry. There has
been much publicity over lay-offs at Ford, Rolls-Royce and Jaguar. But UK
car production this year is running only 3 per cent below its peak in 1989.
This is partly to do with Japanese manufacturers setting up new capacity,
but not entirely. Vauxhall's production this year is 32 per cent higher than
in 1989, and Land Rover's 28 per cent.
Again, the German car maker Mercedes-Benz has just announced that it almost
trebled the amount it spent with British component manufacturers in 1991.
'The British economy', it said, 'is under-rated'.
It seems clear from this that the idea of a recession-induced crisis in
British industry does not bear inspection. But perhaps the real issue is
wider than that. If the recession is not doing drastic damage in itself, it
may still be a stark reminder of underlying decline.
The best measure of this is not, as is sometimes supposed, the dwindling
contribution of industry to output and employment. This is a natural trend
in any developed economy, as workers are replaced by machines and
manufactured goods become cheaper in real terms. The real test is the
balance of trade in manufacturing; and it is here that the alarm bells start
ringing.
For at least 40 years, Britain's imports of manufactured goods have been
rising faster than its exports. In the mid-1950s, exports were three times
as large as imports. By a decade ago they were the same size. Ever since
then, the UK has been running a persistent deficit in manufactured goods.
The roots of the problem are simple enough. The UK's volume of manufacturing
output is now virtually the same as it was in 1973. In that time, the
economy as a whole has grown by a third. Since consumption of manufactured
goods rises with national income, imports have been sucked in to make good
the difference. In 1973, imports had a 21 per cent share of the UK market
for manufactured goods. By 1989 they had 37 per cent. Meanwhile, the UK has
lost ground in world exports. Its share in 1970 was 8 per cent, in 1980 7.5
per cent and in 1990 6 per cent.
But the UK is not alone in showing a deficit. Last year, the gap was
proportionately wider in the US, to say nothing of less developed EC
partners such as Spain, Portugal and Greece. So does the deficit actually
matter?
The answer ultimately depends on a number of imponderables. The deficit need
not matter if it can be paid for by exporting services, or indeed by
importing capital from foreign multinationals such as Japanese car makers.
Whether that can be achieved in the 1990s is not easy to judge. If it
cannot, there are those optimists who say that the deficit can be cured when
the upturn comes. What remains of UK manufacturing is better managed and
more internationally minded than it was 10 years ago. In addition, foreign
companies in the UK are now training its workforce in modern techniques of
manufacture.
There are two reasons for pessimism. First, recent large-scale foreign
investment in the UK is mostly confined to the car industry, which accounts
for only some 8 per cent of total UK manufacturing. It is not clear how many
other industries will attract such inward investment.
And above all, the long-run trend is simply too consistent. For decades,
through boom and slump, UK manufacturing has been losing ground. It is very
much in the national interest that the trend should be halted. It is asking
a good deal for it to be reversed.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The costs of closure: FT writers answer the questions
arising from the controversy over coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, IAN HARGREAVES, DAVID GOODHART and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is Britain sharply scaling down its coal industry if this will throw
tens of thousands out of work and lead to more imports?
British Coal has been heavily subsidised - to the tune of Pounds 100m a
month, according to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary. He would
rather cut British Coal down to a smaller size, even at the risk of boosting
imports, because he believes this will bring benefits for the economy as a
whole, such as greater efficiency and cheaper electricity. Britain is not
the only country to run down its coal industry. Several Continental
countries have shut down their mines for good.
2. But isn't British Coal the most efficient producer left in Europe?
Yes, by far. It mines coal at a fraction of the price of Germany and Spain,
the only two Continental coal producers of any size. But this is irrelevant
since prices in the international coal market are dictated by large
producing countries including the US, Australia and Colombia. Typical
British Coal prices are currently 50 per cent higher than imported coal. In
its restructured form British Coal's management believes it could match
imported prices within five years.
3. If Spain and Germany believe it is worth paying a price to keep their
coal industry, why doesn't the UK?
In contrast with those countries, Britain has a wide choice of indigenous
fuels, so it is not as tightly locked in to one in particular. It is also
questionable whether Spain and Germany will be able to continue subsidising
their coal industries under European Community rules. But the fundamental
reason is that the UK government believes the price is too great, and
produces unacceptable distortions in the energy market.
4. Wouldn't it be cheaper for us to pay the coal miners to go on working?
And what effect will this have on our balance of payments?
The government will spend Pounds 1bn on coal community aid and redundancy
payments, and achieve subsidy savings of Pounds 1.2bn a year, if Mr
Heseltine's figures are correct. But the public cost will be much higher if
you take into account the ripple effect on unemployment, lost tax revenues
and so on. If British Coal is privatised, the Treasury will also have to
assume billions of pounds of liabilities for pensions, mine subsidence and
free coal for miners. The cost to the Treasury will therefore be
substantial. Whether the net result is worth it depends on how far Mr
Heseltine's wider benefits materialise.
The balance of payments will suffer from a rise in coal imports, though
these may not be as big as feared because of the switch out of coal into
domestically produced gas.
5. Why do the cuts have to happen now, in the depths of a recession?
The timing is dictated by the long-term effects of privatisation of the
electricity industry. The electricity generators were privatised on the
understanding that when their contracts with British Coal ran out in April
1993, they could renegotiate them on realistic rather than inflated prices.
Negotiations on those contracts are now underway, and it is clear that the
generators want to take as little British coal as possible because of its
high cost. If the government wanted to postpone the colliery closures, it
would either have to roll back electricity privatisation, or subsidise the
1993 contracts - neither of which it is prepared to do.
6. Is the National Union of Mineworkers to blame for the closures? Or are Mr
Arthur Scargill's dire predictions being proved correct?
The effect of the Scargill-led dispute in 1984-85 was to speed up, not slow
down, the pace of pit closures. It also helped put back the recent
productivity improvements by about two years, thus preventing more pits from
reaching an acceptable cost base. Once the die had been cast for electricity
privatisation, much of what Mr Scargill had warned about was bound to come
true, but that was partly because his own union had undermined the security
 -of - supply argument for coal and made it a less attractive fuel for the
generators.
7. What is the chance of the closures being stopped?
The unions have little industrial leverage, but they hope to raise a
sufficient public outcry to frighten the government into reversing its
position, as with the poll tax. To that end Mr Scargill has adopted a
moderate strategy, eschewing a strike ballot (for now) and talking about the
costs to the taxpayer. But this is unlikely to be enough. The best hope for
a moratorium comes from Tory backbenchers and the courts. If enough Tory
backbenchers vote with Labour for a review of the closures in next
Wednesday's debate, they will presumably be stopped for at least a few
months. On Thursday the High Court is due to decide whether British Coal
abandoned its own colliery review procedure. Tory backbenchers are a better
bet than the judges.
The government would survive if it was defeated in the debate, but Mr
Heseltine may feel obliged to resign because he has become so closely
associated with the decisions announced this week.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, says his party's aim is to save the
coal mines - not bring down the government. The motion that Labour will draw
up for the debate will aim at attracting the maximum number of wavering
Conservative MPs. If the government loses, it is likely to table immediately
a motion expressing confidence in the government - which it would probably
win comfortably.
8. Are we right to be using gas when we have far less of it than coal, and
what effect will it have on my electricity bill?
There is a great deal of gas in the North Sea - enough to last at least 50
years, so there are no short-term supply problems.
The switch to gas is happening partly for commercial reasons, but also
because of bad planning in the electricity privatisation. Gas has many
advantages over coal: it is cleaner, easier to transport and converts more
efficiently into electricity. Gas power stations are also quick and cheap to
build, and face fewer planning obstacles. Whether gas produces electricity
more cheaply than coal is much disputed because although coal looks cheaper
on paper, not all calculations take full account of its heavy environmental
costs - which will grow as more green regulations are implemented.
Mr Heseltine says the closure of the coal mines will wipe Pounds 300m off
electricity bills, but Mr Andrew Horsler, marketing director of British
Coal, claims gas-fired stations will add to electricity bills because they
will replace coal stations whose costs have already been completely written
off, and therefore can produce electricity very cheaply.
Another problem is that electricity distribution companies are building gas
stations to cut their dependence on supplies from the duopoly of National
Power and PowerGen. Present rules allow them to pass the cost straight
through to customers so they have no incentive to buy the cheapest fuel.
9. If we abandon all these coal mines now, could we mine the coal again
later?
British Coal is mothballing four of the 31 collieries listed for closure in
case its market revives. But it is costly to keep mines open and these will
most likely be shut too unless there is a swift change in coal's fortunes.
If, next century, the UK decided to switch back to coal, it would have to
build new mines.
10. It sounds as if there are monopolistic practices going on in the
electricity industry which are hitting coal unfairly and adding to
electricity costs.
The National Power/PowerGen duopoly has undoubtedly been able to drive a
hard bargain with British Coal, and it has already been threatened with
possible monopoly investigation by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity
regulator, for trying to influence electricity prices. But Prof Littlechild
himself has come under fire from consumers for allegedly failing to ensure
that electricity distributors are buying the cheapest possible power when
they contract with gas-fired power stations. Some of them have threatened to
take him to court. If they win, gas power station deals might have to be
unraveled.
11. If the coal cuts go through, will Britain then have achieved the free
market in energy which the government wants?
No. The nuclear power industry receives Pounds 1.2bn of subsidies a year,
though these are being phased out. Nuclear could be in for the British Coal
treatment in 1994 when the government plans to review its future. One lesson
the nuclear power industry will have learnt this week is that it has only
two years to prove that it can stand on its own feet.
There are also tight controls on electricity distribution which effectively
create regional monopolies. These are also supposed to be phased out over
the coming years. A totally free market, if such a thing were possible, is
not in sight until the end of this decade.
12. Although the cuts are regrettable, perhaps the run-down of coal is a
good thing for the environment?
Coal is unquestionably the dirtiest fuel, in terms of the damage caused by
mining, transportation, and the emissions at power stations, all of which
place extra costs on the economy. It also faces pressure from the
government's commitment to an EC target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions
to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. If the EC were to introduce a
proposed carbon tax, its appeal would be further reduced.
Technology does exist to burn coal more cleanly, and it is being introduced
at power stations. But it is expensive and reduces the efficiency of the
fuel.
13. Will anyone want to buy what's left of the coal industry? Should Sid buy
shares?
In its truncated form, there is a realistic chance that British Coal can
operate profitably. The company was in the black last year, and prospects
exist for further productivity gains to meet the tougher terms of the new
electricity contracts. At the moment, British Coal is more likely to be sold
to another company than floated on the stock exchange as was British Gas.
Some half-dozen large companies have expressed an interest, including
Hanson, owner of one of the largest US coal companies. There are also two
buy-out proposals by trade unions.
But if none of these come about, British Coal could be sold to stock market
investors. In world terms, it would be a minor coal company with moderate
profits at best. World energy supplies are plentiful for the foreseeable
future so, barring upheavals, the price of coal is unlikely to show a sharp
increase.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Luring small investors back into
shares - Philip Coggan reports on the birth of ProShare, which was formed to
promote the benefits of buying UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FANCY a half-hour free consultation with a stockbroker? That is one of the
perks being offered by a new body for private shareholders which was
launched in the UK this week - the ProShare Association, which has been
given financial backing by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock
Exchange, and many leading companies.
This might not be the best time to persuade investors about the merits of
equity investing. Monday is the fifth anniversary of the stock market crash,
which could have frightened many savers away from shares forever.
The present economic news is hardly encouraging, either. Unemployment is
rising rapidly and many of Britain's longest-standing companies are
struggling to cope. But ProShare is relentlessly upbeat about long-term
prospects. Its chairman, Sir Peter Thompson, even said at the launch that
low inflation and falling interest rates would be bad news for
fixed-interest securities - a view contrary to conventional investment
thinking.
The new organisation points to the fact that, over the long term, equities
traditionally have outperformed other investments such as gilts or cash. The
graphic shows just how dramatic the difference can be. Someone who invested
Pounds 100 in shares in 1945 would, with gross income reinvested, have
Pounds 28,513 by now; the same sum in gilts would have grown to just Pounds
1,209.
Treasury bills were used as the best way to illustrate cash returns; it was
only in the 1980s that competition in the building society market drove up
savings rates to attractive levels. Even so, cash returns would have turned
Pounds 100 into just Pounds 2,328. (The figures do not allow for dealing
costs, but the disparity is too great for these to make much difference).
Whether equities continue to do so well is a matter of considerable debate
(see article below). And the sorry experience of investors during the past
few years is that equity returns have been outstripped easily by the
building societies.
Still, any organisation which can be a mouthpiece for private investors as
well as an information provider has to be welcome. The stock market is so
dominated by institutional investors that the small investor must feel like
Andorra trying to compete with the superpowers.
The free stockbroking consultation might seem like a gimmick but it could at
least prompt many people to investigate what often has seemed a stand-offish
profession. About 60 brokers have agreed to take part in the scheme and a
list of these will sent to those who agree to join the association, for
which membership will cost Pounds 30 a year.
In addition to meeting a broker, members will receive an investors'
handbook, a monthly magazine, a portfolio record system, and vouchers for
eight issues of the Weekend FT. Further perks will be added.
There is a free two-month trial period. Those interested in receiving more
information can call 071-971-0061.
IF YOU DECIDE that the time is right for you to buy shares, how would you go
about it and how much would you expect to pay?
Much depends on how much money you have to invest and what kind of service
you expect. There are three basic types of stockbroking service:
Execution-only brokers, who will buy and sell shares on your instructions
but who cannot give advice;
Advisory brokers, who will transact deals and give opinions on the merits of
shares;
Discretionary brokers, who will take charge of your money and invest it on
the basis of their opinions.
These services are not available to everyone. If you want the service of a
discretionary broker, you may need a substantial amount of money to invest,
probably in excess of Pounds 50,000 or so.
Execution-only brokers are far more accessible, but there are considerable
risks involved. It is hard for experts to avoid being caught out by
collapses at companies such as Polly Peck or Maxwell Communications, so the
amateur investor is even more exposed when picking stocks.
In addition, experts tend to agree that investors need a diversified
portfolio of around a dozen shares to avoid the risk that one share might
collapse.
Given the costs of dealing in small sums, this probably means that a
sensible portfolio requires a minimum of Pounds 25,000. The individual
should first make sure that he or she has rainy day savings in the building
society and other investments, such as a good pension scheme.
Those with smaller sums do have ways of benefiting from the growth potential
of shares - unit and investment trusts. Trusts hold a broad range of shares
and thus give the small investor instant diversification. Management charges
can be high but some managers have recently cut fees and offer attractive
deals - such as a Gartmore fund which aims to track the FT-A All-Share Index
and which has no initial charge.
However, some investors may simply want to back their hunches and buy shares
in a company they know well, such as Tesco. As well as the risks involved,
they need to know about the charges. These mainly consist of:
Commission
This is charged by the stockbroker with whom you deal. Brokers normally have
a set minimum commission; with bigger deals being charged in proportion to
the size of the transaction, say 1.5 to 2 per cent.
The cheapest rates tend to be found at execution-only brokers.
Manchester-based Gall and Eke, for example, have a minimum of only Pounds 10
for deals of under Pounds 1,000; Sharelink is currently charging just Pounds
50 for deals of over Pounds 8,000.
Brokers who offer advice and portfolio management will normally charge
higher commissions, but claim this reflects a better standard of service.
Buy-sell spread
Those who trade in shares set two prices; they will buy the shares at the
lower price and sell at the higher.
For example, shares in Marks &amp; Spencer were available on a spread of 325p to
327p before trading started yesterday morning. Newspaper listings, such as
the Financial Times, quote the mid-price of 326p, but if you had wanted to
buy shares you would have paid at least 327p.
Investors must make up this spread before they can make a profit. The spread
on Marks &amp; Spencer is fairly narrow; but it can be far larger on small
company shares. Take Acsis, a wonder stock in early 1987; the spread
yesterday morning was 0.5p to 1p. So an investor who bought the shares and
immediately sold them would face an instant loss of 50 per cent on his or
her investment.
Stamp duty
This is charged by the government at a rate of 0.5 per cent of a
transaction's value. You only pay the duty when you buy shares, not when you
sell them. The duty is due to be abolished when the Stock Exchange
introduces a new electronic system of share dealing called TAURUS.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Pep charges cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MURRAY JOHNSTONE, the fund management group which led the recent round of
charge cutting, has abolished all excess charges on its unit trust personal
equity plans, writes Philip Coggan.
The group's unit trusts currently have an initial charge of 1 per cent,
compared with an industry average of 5 per cent. The total bid-offer spread
varies between 2.2 per cent and 4.7 per cent.
In other words, someone who invested in a Murray Johnstone unit trust Pep
would face an instant loss of between 2.2 and 4.7 per cent on the value of
the investment. The 'immediate realisable value', as Murray Johnstone
describes it, of Pounds 100 invested would be between Pounds 97.80 and
Pounds 95.30.
That compares well with some unit trust Peps where, what with high bid-offer
spreads and additional Pep charges, the investor might easily face a hit of
8 per cent. The immediate realisable value of Pounds 100 invested would be
Pounds 92.
Other unit trust managers would point out that Murray Johnstone's annual
charge is 1.5 per cent, while many managers charge 1 per cent. This will hit
performance over the long term, which could offset the lower initial charge.
Many managers would argue that performance, not charges, is paramount. Here
Murray's performance is variable. The UK growth, smaller company and
European funds have below average performances over the three years to
October 1; the Equity Income and Acumen funds have performed better than
their sector averages over the period.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Is it time to buy?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE RINGS a bell to tell private investors when it is the right time to
buy shares. There is always the risk of buying just before the market
plunges.
Yesterday's base rate cut caused a mini-rally in equities. Any fall in
interest rates increases the attractions of shares over cash; and declining
rates ease the burdens on indebted companies and increase the chance that
the economy will recover.
But cutting rates has its dangers. The pound may weaken, leading to rising
import prices and higher inflation. And the prospect of a declining pound
may dissuade overseas investors from buying UK shares.
Nevertheless, the traditional valuation methods provide some comfort for
those who believe the time is right to buy. The dividend yield on the FT-A
All-Share is 4.9 per cent, marginally below the 20 year average of 5.1 per
cent but significantly above the rate of inflation at 3.6 per cent. In the
last quarter century, real yields have normally been negative, not positive.
The ratio of long term gilt to equity yields is even better news. The higher
the ratio, the more attractive the returns on gilts - and the greater the
danger that investors will sell shares and buy bonds. Indeed, the ratio
peaked at 3.34 on October 2 1987 - just before the Crash. But the ratio is
currently 1.9, below the 1976-92 average of 2.2.
Prospects are less encouraging if you watch the price-earnings ratio, which
relates share prices to corporate profits. Over the last 20 years, the
average p/e ratio on the FT-A 500 Index has been 11; the current ratio of
15.7 is well above that, indicating that shares are expensive in historical
terms.
But Ian Stephenson, of Smith New Court, feels that if private investors can
afford to lock money away, they should think about moving into the market.
He points out that if gilt yields fall to 8 per cent and the yield ratio
remains around current levels, share yields will fall to 4 per cent,
offering the prospect of a 20 per cent capital gain.
The gloomsters' view is that traditional valuation methods have become
irrelevant owing to fundamental changes in the investment climate. Some
argue that we face a Great Depression akin to the 1930s. Deflation will
occur and that will mean falls in asset prices such as houses and shares.
'We believe the rise from the November 1987 lows represents nothing more
than the biggest suckers' rally in history', says David Kauders, a
Taunton-based financial adviser who has been recommending his clients to
invest in gilts and US treasury bonds. In his newsletter he says: 'It is
essential at present to stand aside from stock markets, to make very few
changes to your portfolios of government securities.'
With expert views diverging so sharply, the average investor can be forgiven
for feeling confused. At least some compromises are available.
The first is the savings schemes offered by unit and investment trusts.
These allow the investor to buy into the market gradually and avoid the
danger of investing just before a crash. Pound-cost averaging means that
investors buy more shares and units when prices are low.
Guaranteed products can protect against capital loss. They are not ideal,
since the investor normally needs to hold them for a set period to receive
the guarantee, does not receive any income and may suffer a tax penalty.
Two five year bonds were launched by the Britannia Building Society and
Guardian Royal Exchange this week. The first offers 110 per cent of the rise
in the FT-SE 100 Index over five years; the GRE offer will pay slightly less
than Footsie's rise. Those interested should consult a financial adviser.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Clinton country: the rise of the new South - Thirty years on
from the Alabama race riots, America's blacks are prospering from the
economic rebirth of the US southern states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHOTOGRAPH still has the power to shock and anger: it shows a white
policeman, wearing sinister dark glasses, grasping a tall, well-dressed
black youth by his shirt as the policeman's dog sinks its fangs into the
boy's stomach. The picture - taken almost 30 years ago in Birmingham,
Alabama, at the height of America's civil rights movement - was one of those
perfectly composed images that linger in the imagination and help to define
an era.
Its portrayal of naked white violence and passive black resistance was
carried prominently on the front pages of newspapers around the world,
symbolising the struggle by blacks throughout the American South for equal
voting rights and an end to segregated facilities reminiscent of South
Africa's apartheid. The scenes in Birmingham in that spring of 1963, where
police turned dogs and water cannons on children protesting peacefully, also
gave the steel manufacturing city an international stigma it has never
shaken off entirely. Yet, a surprise awaits the visitor to Birmingham who, a
generation on, still expects a grimy, industrial backwater of malevolent
racism.
Race remains a strong political factor, notably in a long legal fight by
white municipal unions to prevent positive job discrimination in favour of
blacks by the city government. But a black mayor has run city hall since
1979 and, last month, the park in which the worst police violence took place
was dedicated as part of a specially renovated civil rights memorial
district. The city still makes steel, but most of its growth industries now
are in high technology and the wooded hills that ripple away from the centre
largely are free of industrial pollution. Birmingham has become a major
medical centre, too; actress Jane Fonda, renowned for being politically
correct, had a knee injury treated there recently.
You can get a good idea of its material wealth at the suburban Riverchase
Galleria, a vast, glass-enclosed mall which houses the same predictable
retailing names found in smart shopping centres across the continent:
Benetton, Brooks Brothers, Laura Ashley - even Crabtree &amp; Evelyn of London,
'purveyors of fine toiletries to the gentry'. Birmingham, in short, is a
prime example of the new South, the term used to describe the economic,
social and technological changes of the past 20 years which have turned
parts of the southern US from provincial backwaters into some of the
nation's fastest growing communities.
These changes have been underlined by this year's presidential election
campaign. The all-southern Democratic ticket of Bill Clinton (Arkansas) and
Al Gore (Tennessee) would have been unthinkable a mere decade ago. To the
rest of the US even then, the old South produced such conflicting images as
slavery, sentimental Gone With the Wind romance, virulent racism and Ku Klux
Klan cross-burnings, fundamental Christianity, redneck conservatism, foxy
decadence and a benighted, Gothic savagery. This potent, if confused, brew
meant that any southern presidential candidate had to be balanced by a
vice-president from well beyond the 11 states that made up the civil war
confederacy.
Admittedly, the Clinton-Gore team is not from the deepest South. Arkansas,
with its tradition of small, independent farmers and hill folk, has as much
in common with Texas (the adopted home of President Bush) as it does with
the old plantation economies of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and
the Carolinas. And Gore, brought up mainly in Washington DC, is about as
southern as Kentucky Fried Chicken. But the ticket does show - as Jimmy
Carter, America's most truly southern president to date, has pointed out -
the degree to which the region has become more like the rest of America (and
vice versa, judging from Clinton's policies which would not come amiss from
a liberal Republican).
Yet, a huge gulf still separates the bustle and post-modern skyscrapers of
Atlanta, the economic capital of the generally prosperous south-east, from
the back roads of rural Mississippi, the nation's poorest state in per
capita income. In the vast flatlands of the cotton growing Mississippi
delta, you can still come across barefooted blacks and shanty homes that
would not look out of place in Africa.
Undoubtedly, the single most remarkable change across the region is its
improved race relations. The catalyst was the civil rights movement; this
led to the passage, in the mid-1960s, of federal legislation which forced
the white South to end segregation in public places and give blacks the
vote. Schools, restaurants, toilets, and hotels became integrated. Black
voters began propelling their own politicians into municipal positions of
power.
The most encouraging example of racial tolerance now can be found in
Atlanta, which has had black mayors since 1973. The city owes its
prosperity, in part, to a realisation in the 1940s by its white business
leaders that racial harmony was good for profits; hence its long-time
slogan, 'The City Too Busy to Hate'. In the 1960s, it was the headquarters
of the civil rights movement, and the fact that it desegregated before other
southern centres encouraged many US companies to locate their regional
headquarters there. Today, the city is run by a cosy alliance of black
politicians and white businessmen.
Atlanta has long had a sizeable black middle class and America's highest
concentration of black higher education centres. Over the past decade or so,
it has become a magnet for ambitious blacks from across the nation, making
it the clearest example of a remarkable phenomenon: blacks whose parents and
grand-parents fled north earlier this century in search of a better life are
now drifting back. The reasons are several: job opportunities, a desire to
rediscover roots, and an escape from the stark racial polarisation and inner
city ghettoes of many northern centres.
Teresa Roseborough, a rising young star at the prominent Atlanta law firm of
Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan, is typical. Born in the mid-west and educated
at universities in the upper South, she could have had her pick of law firms
across the US after serving on the Supreme Court staff in Washington. She
explains that one reason she chose Atlanta was because of its greater career
opportunities for herself and her husband  - but another was that she feels
more comfortable with southern people. 'They are more likely to be cordial -
irrespective of colour,' she says.'
None of this means the South is a paradise of racial harmony. Even in
Atlanta, which stands at one extreme, the races socialise rarely. And just
50 miles north lies Forsyth county, long known as a centre of redneck
racism. Occasional Klan cross-burnings still light the southern night skies
(although these are said to be more common now outside the region, in which
the KKK is regarded more as a minor irritant than a sinister force).
You can find plenty of subtly segregated facilities - like the Little Rock
golf course where Clinton played earlier this year; or Mississippi's
university system, which was the subject of a violent civil rights battle in
September 1962 and remains embroiled in a court case over its slow progress
towards integration. And there will always be politicians, such as
Louisiana's David Duke, who try to play the race card.
But this does not undermine the surprising fact that, in many respects, the
South seems to enjoy better race relations than the north. John Lewis, the
son of an Alabama sharecropper who is now a US congressman for central
Atlanta, argues that 'the greatest sense of hope, the greatest sense of
optimism, when it comes to race relations . . . is in the South - in spite
of the past, in spite of the problems we still have.'
Improved race relations certainly have played a key role in the South's
economic boom which, over 30 years, has changed a primarily agricultural
society into an increasingly urban one that depends on industry and
services. Drive a little way out of Nashville, the home of country music,
and you will reach two of the most modern car factories in the US: Nissan's
plant at Smyrna and General Motors' Saturn factory at Spring Hill. BMW has
just announced plans to build its first plant outside Germany in South
Carolina.
Economic development, however, is grinding away at the South's distinct
cultural identity. The impact of urbanisation is one cause. Another is the
growing number of Americans from other regions who now work, or retire, in a
region with low living and property costs and good weather. But it is easy
to exaggerate this loss of identity, especially if you do not venture beyond
the big cities. Southern food, for example, remains distinctly different. To
breakfast on grits and 'biscuit' (a kind of scone) and gravy at the Holiday
Inn in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas, is to appreciate that you are a long
way from home.
Family, always a linchpin of the South, remains a powerful binding force.
And, above all, religion still plays a crucial role; the region is still
home to America's tele-evangelists despite the financial and sexual scandals
which engulfed so many of the breed in the 1980s. Author VS Naipaul, who
toured the South late in the 1980s, wrote: 'In no other part of the world
had I found people so driven by the idea of good behaviour and the religious
life. And that was true for black and white.'
Then there is the past, which also lives on as a kind of religion. In the
north, no one outside history classes mentions the civil war now. In the
defeated South, though, it has continued to be an ever-present source of
potential resentment, be it the town war memorial, the Confederate flag
flying from a state capitol, or constant references by tourist guides to the
cold-blooded devastation wreaked by the Yankee General Sherman on his march
to the sea. Yet, even this religion is now losing its force. Jim Henderson,
an Atlanta lawyer from an old Southern family, says: 'My hunch is that my
generation - and I'm 40 - will be the last for which the civil war holds a
fascination.'
It is hardly surprising that such fundamental changes have been pounced-on
by that most powerful force for cultural homogeneity, the US television
industry. One of the most popular US comedies used to be The Dukes of
Hazzard, in which good ol' southern redneck boys chased assorted villains
around the countryside, accompanied by a blonde bombshell, a corrupt
sheriff, and a dungaree-clad grandpappy. In other words, the South as
hayseed slapstick.
In the 1990s, network television's definitive southern comedy is Designing
Women, which focuses on four strong, well-dressed southern women and a
rather fey black male companion who run a Georgia interior design company.
The tone is sophisticated and feminist. There are no racial undertones, yet
the show projects down-home common sense and warm, southern hospitality. No
coincidence, then, that the producer is a close friend and adviser to Bill
Clinton.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Long View: Mortgages that threaten ruin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOOM HAS recently intensified in the British housing market, with Halifax
Building Society's estimate of a remarkable and unprecedented 3.1 per cent
average price drop in the single month of September.
True, there were exceptional factors such as the ending of the stamp duty
holiday in August, and anyway September is seasonally weak. However, the
figure only confirms the underlying downtrend, with a year-on-year decline
of 7.5 per cent. Applied across the UK's 15.5m owner-occupied dwellings that
implies a loss of aggregate wealth of Pounds 80bn in 12 months.
To a greater or lesser extent this hits us all. The biggest postbag I ever
received after one of these Saturday columns was in January 1990 when I
suggested that UK entry to the ERM would knock 25 per cent off house prices.
My correspondents - who included a Tory MP - were alarmed: could I be
serious? Indeed I was, but when the government duly entered the ERM nine
months later one of its biggest errors was its failure to warn housebuyers
of the risks.
However the politicians were thinking much more about the next general
election than about the need to protect gullible homebuyers from a powerful
lending industry keen to thrust 100 per cent mortgages down their throats.
But much water, as well as money, has flowed under the bridge. We are now
out of the ERM again, and merrily cutting interest rates. Will house prices,
freed from Germanic restraint, get back on to their former uptrend? I
suspect, not for quite a while.
On average, according to the Halifax, house prices have fallen by 12 per
cent in nominal terms since the national market peaked in July 1989.
Allowing for retail price inflation that is a decline of 27 per cent in real
terms. And although house prices have been known in the past to fall in real
terms the nominal decline of the past three or four years is quite
unprecedented in the living memory of homeowners. In London nominal prices
are down by 24 per cent since a late 1988 peak.
Of course, if you live in Scotland you may wonder what all the fuss is
about. House prices there are still rising (just) and the puncturing of the
great south-east England house price bubble has meant that the ratio of
prices in London and Scotland has returned to early 1980s levels at about
1.35 instead of the 2.3 touched in 1988.
In one sense, therefore, the housing market is simply returning to sanity,
in a thoroughly healthy way. This applies to the earnings relationship too.
Whereas the ratio of the average house price to average earnings headed
dangerously for the stratosphere in 1989, reaching almost 5.0, it is now
just about back within what could be regarded as the historically normal
range of 3.0-3.5.
But there the good news ends, because it would be prudent to expect the
ratio to undershoot on the downside: it could easily drop significantly
below 3 before the confidence of both borrowers and lenders can be rebuilt.
Moreover we must remember that although house price relationships have
become rebalanced, in one vital respect there has been a big change since
the mid-1980s: much more debt is secured on the British housing stock.
Values have been declining in the past two years, but mortgage outstandings
have continued climbing - from Pounds 294bn to Pounds 321bn in 1991, and
probably by nearly another Pounds 20bn this year. Ten years ago mortgages
represented 22 per cent of the value of the housing stock, but today the
figure is a worrying 35 per cent. This is worse than it looks, because there
are mortgages on only 10m homes, which therefore bear 54 per cent debt on
average. Within the 10m is a significant (at least 10 per cent, and growing)
proportion on which the debt:equity ratio is over 100 per cent.
Will a post-devaluation spurt in inflation help? The trouble is, only pay
inflation will ease the burden. In the next year or two pay rises are likely
to lag behind price inflation as the personal sector suffers a cut in living
standards. There is precious little comfort there, although yesterday's
one-point cut in interest rates will obviously help.
Lots of self-serving solutions are being promoted by the mortgage industry.
The other week I received a press release from a firm of mortgage
counsellors whose business is advising home owners who cannot service their
debts. Answers to the crisis, it was suggested, included encouraging banks
and building societies to offer 100 per cent mortgages to first time buyers
and finding a way in which second time buyers could carry their negative
equity over to their next house. Otherwise house prices could never recover.
But it was 100 per cent mortgages that got us into this mess in the first
place. It is hard to imagine that more of the same could ultimately be good
for anybody except debt counsellors. Of course, the lending industry is
desperate for a sharp jump in house prices that would bail everybody out of
the current disaster. Awkwardly, the rational view is that on the
fundamentals house prices at present are not low. Moreover they might well
ease further over the next year - what price homes in the Yorkshire
coalfields? - before beginning to climb slowly in parallel with average
earnings. If it works out like this, up to 2m home buyers and important
sections of the mortgage lending industry face potential ruin.
It is time for the government to be preparing a national household mortgage
workout scheme to absorb, reschedule and, where necessary, write down the
problem loans. The sums will be staggering, because the debt involved must
be of the order of Pounds 50bn. This includes the 1m-plus uncovered
mortgages which are not in most cases bad but must be refinanced on a
partially unsecured basis if young people are not to be stuck for many years
in starter homes.
Acacia Avenue is sinking under water and will soon need a lifeboat.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Pit closure legality to be debated in courts next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGALITY of British Coal's pit closure programme will be fought out in a
series of hearings to be hurried through the courts before next Friday when
the corporation is due to issue its first redundancy notices to more than
5,000 mineworkers.
A timetable for the hearings - which will take place alongside mounting
public campaigns and a parliamentary debate on the proposed closures - was
set after British Coal announced in the High Court yesterday that no
redundancy notices would be issued for another week.
The National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods, the pit deputies' union, which
are bringing the main action against British Coal, said the announcement was
'an enormous and significant concession'.
'This means a further week will go by during which the men will still have
jobs,' Mr Mark Stephens, the unions' solicitor, said after the hearing.
However, British Coal denied that it had conceded any ground, insisting it
had always intended to issue notices next Friday and that the pit closures
would go ahead as planned.
'British Coal wishes to make it clear that the closure programme continues
and that there is no legal basis to stop it,' Mr Charles Falconer QC told
the court.
The unions claim that British Coal has failed to comply with European and UK
law and the colliery review procedure in not consulting its workforce before
implementing the closures.
The case will be heard in the High Court on Tuesday. Whatever the result of
the hearing, it is certain to be referred to the Court of Appeal for a
second judgment before Friday.
In a separate case, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers won leave to seek a
judicial review of British Coal's decision to close seven Nottinghamshire
pits and one in Derbyshire.
Mr Justice Roch ruled that the union had an arguable case on the basis that
British Coal's action was allegedly unreasonable, irrational and
disproportionate and that proper consultation procedures had not been
followed.
The UDM case will be heard after that brought by the NUM.
Mr Roy Lynk, the UDM's president, yesterday continued an underground sit-in
at the Silverhill colliery in Nottinghamshire in protest at the planned
closures. Two Tory MPs who tried to visit him, Mr Winston Churchill and Mrs
Elizabeth Peacock, were prevented from going down the mine by British Coal.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Suppliers to collieries fear 120,000 job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL-OUT from this week's pit closure announcement spread yesterday with
a warning from colliery equipment manufacturers that up to 120,000
additional jobs could quickly be lost in the wake of the British Coal
decision.
Coal industry suppliers expressed astonishment at the imminence of the
closures which they said had thrown business plans into chaos and threatened
widespread redundancy.
Some companies said British Coal had already cancelled orders and was trying
to stop other orders that had been despatched by suppliers.
The Association of British Mining Equipment Companies said the closure
decision threatened tens of thousands of jobs among its own members and
within associated industries.
Mr Bill Morrell, director general of Abmec, said member companies, with a
combined turnover of Pounds 900m a year, were 'absolutely appalled' at the
pit closures.
Companies had been supplying a declining coal industry and many, as a
result, had reduced their dependency on the sector. But the decision would
still be catastrophic: 'It has taken our breath away,' he added.
Mining equipment manufacturers around the country yesterday warned of
reduced capacity and skills which would damage export opportunities.
Many doubted that the remaining pits would still provide new orders as
modern, state-of-the-art equipment would be shifted from closed collieries.
British Coal's central stocking system meant that the company already held
extensive supplies.
Mr Adrian Parsons, managing director of Century Oils Group, which supplies
fire-resistant hydraulic fluids and gear box lubricants to British Coal,
said the prospect of a 50 per cent cut in sales next year meant certain job
cuts.
Mr Philip Kellett, company secretary of Morley Electrical Engineering, the
West Yorkshire-based company which supplies industrial motors to British
Coal, said the pit closures would have meant collapse for the company if it
had not diversified into new products and markets.
Mr David Hind, technical director of Senior Davis Derby, which supplies
signalling and monitoring equipment to British Coal, said the workforce was
'shattered' at the decision.
The company, which employed about 600 people 10 years ago, now has 170
employees. Mr Hind said the pit closures inevitably meant further job
losses.
He added: 'The miners who are about to lose their jobs will at least benefit
from some comparatively generous redundancy payments. But people in supplier
industries who are about to lose their jobs will not be so fortunate.'
Mr Adrian Buckmaster, chairman and chief executive of MECO International, a
Worcester-based maker of conveyor systems, said his company had already made
500 UK workers redundant since last summer. There would be no immediate job
cuts but the outlook depended on investment plans for those pits which
remained.

VIDEO game enthusiasts will soon be able to put themselves in Batman's shoes
to exchange blows with the Penguin or cuddle with Catwoman. Or they could
choose to make a music video using film footage of popular rock musicians.
Sega, the Japanese electronic games manufacturer, this week unveiled a
compact disc-based video games system which will allow users to interact
with characters in Hollywood films as well as with popular bands on video.
The system is the first to bring realistic, digitised video film games to
the consumer market.
The videos and films that Sega will incorporate into its new games will
initially come from the libraries of Hollywood studios, such as Warner
Brothers, and music video publishers, including Sony Electronic Publishing,
with which the company simultaneously announced a strategic alliance to
develop CD-based games.
'Up to this point video games have been animated characters. Sega CD allows
players to control real actors. It's like being in a movie theatre and
controlling the actors on the screen,' says Mr Doug Glen, group marketing
director.
Sega has also set up a multimedia studio in Redwood City, California, and is
filming a game alongside Steven Spielberg, on the set of his film Jurassic
Park. The game will be launched at the same time as the film.
Video games are increasingly expected to be based on CDs, which offer better
sound quality, graphics and greater storage capacity and manipulating power
than the games cartridges currently in use.
Nintendo, Sega's main competitor, announced this week it would launch a
CD-based games system in the US and Japan in August 1993.
Sega will launch its new system in the US next month at a suggested retail
price of Dollars 299 (Pounds 173.80).

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Japanese banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese authorities have good reason to study the 1974 British
secondary banking crisis. As with Britain's property collapse then, it is
Japan's smaller banks which are first in the firing line. Yesterday Ugo and
Akita Akebono banks merged after a slump in Akita's profits. More mergers
are sure to follow, particularly among weaker trust and regional banks.
The government's reluctance to finance a bailout is understandable given
public opposition. Yet it seems unlikely the private sector lifeboat under
construction will prove equal to the task. Even by reasonably conservative
estimates, the banks have Y30,000bn (Pounds 148bn) of bad property loans.
They cannot afford to write off that amount over the next few years.
Perhaps tax relief may be given on bad loans put into the lifeboat, and the
Bank of Japan may indirectly make money available at preferential rates.
This would help, but only rapid economic growth or a strong stock market
would generate the profits banks need to repair the damage. Neither is
likely. The economy is still in trouble as yesterday's industrial production
figures underline, and August's economic package may be of limited help. It
may take the imminent prospect of bank failures to break the consensus
against government intervention.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government borrowing figures released yesterday confirm that public sector
finances are in a mess. Not too much can be read into the sharp increase in
expenditure during September, since this is a volatile figure. More worrying
for the gilts market are signs that the recessionary squeeze on revenue is
accelerating: income tax receipts were sharply lower last month, reflecting
falls in employment. It is surprising that gilts should treat this news with
such equanimity.
Deepening gloom about the prospects for growth and equities may be an
explanation, prompting institutions to switch into bonds. Interesting,
though, that long gilts should rise again after yesterday's base rate cut.
The continued demand for index-linked gilts - evidenced by yesterday's
Pounds 400m issue - certainly suggests the market retains a healthy degree
of scepticism about the chancellor's promise to bear down on inflation.
Without firm action to bring the PSBR under control, the gilts market may
find its optimism impossible to maintain. PSBR forecasts of more than Pounds
40bn next year may be premature, but funding on anywhere near this scale
would place upward pressure on yields. The government may conclude that
higher long gilt yields are a small price to pay for the political advantage
of lower mortgage rates. A deficit of perhaps 6 per cent of gross domestic
product would be easy to fund if the markets had confidence in the
government and in sterling. Both commodities are in short supply.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont cedes a point
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 1 point cut in base rates can be summed up as the right decision
for the wrong reason. As recently as Monday, when sterling closed at
DM2.5125, the chancellor promised to take the exchange rate into account
when setting monetary policy. When he cut rates yesterday, it was some five
pfennigs lower. The decision smacks of political pressure. The satisfaction
the equity market might have taken is offset by the realisation that policy
has become as unpredictable as the government's relationship with its own
backbenchers.
Moreover, it is doubtful whether a low interest rate policy can be sustained
without serious damage to sterling. Euro-sterling rates have not fallen
below their D-Mark equivalent since the spring of 1981. During the following
autumn base rates were raised from 12 to 16 per cent. That pattern need not
be repeated this time because the government may be resigned to sterling
weakness, and because German rates should be falling next year. But it still
suggests there is a limit to any further cuts.
One explanation for the equity market's lukewarm response is that currency
risk will deter overseas investors at a time when UK institutions are pretty
fully invested in shares. A weaker currency may also prompt the government
to bear down even more heavily on public spending and the PSBR which would
be bad for growth. Perhaps it is because recovery prospects are still so
bleak that the gilts market sailed through yesterday with such ease. Yet
currency risk is as much a cause for concern in gilts as it is in equities.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Rover unions back 7.3% 18-month deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS at Rover have rec-ommended acceptance of a two-stage 18-month pay
deal worth a minimum 7.3 per cent which would take effect after the current
pay freeze.
The six-month pay freeze for the UK carmaker's 34,000 workers was imposed
last month. The first stage of the increase, if agreed, will take effect on
May 1, instead of the company's normal November 1 settlement date.
The package illustrates the continuing downward pressure on private-sector
pay, with settlements currently running at about 4 per cent. The government
wants increases in public-sector pay - which are now rising faster than
those in the private sector - depressed to about 2 per cent a year, its
target for long-term inflation.
Pay talks at Rover lasted three days and both management and unions said the
talks had gone 'smoothly'.
Mr Tony Woodley, national officer with the TGWU general union, described the
pack-age as 'reasonable' for both sides.
He said there was no doubt that a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies
agreed recently with Rover had played an important part in negotiations. The
job-security guarantee was made as part of the company's 'new deal' reforms
in working practices.
Under the latest pay agreement, pay would rise by 3.6 per cent, with a
second 3.6 per cent increase from November 1993 for one year.
The package contains an inflation trigger - should inflation exceed 4 per
cent next October employees would get a lump-sum payment of Pounds 150,
equivalent to an extra 1.2 per cent for production-line workers who earn
about Pounds 240 a week.
The complicated package would give some 5,000 skilled workers an additional
3 per cent, according to union negotiators.
Mr Woodley said the package contained 24 separate improvements including
increased holiday entitlements.
The Rover pay freeze followed recent moves by Ford and Rolls-Royce to cut
2,500 jobs in the UK as the recession continues to take a heavy toll on the
British motor industry.
The freeze includes directors and senior managers as well as shop-floor
workers. Mr John Towers, group managing director, said it was necessary to
'help protect the company from the worst consequences of the recession'.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Tories urge Jubilee Line cash pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Wakeham, leader of the House of Lords, has urged the chairmen of Lloyds
and Barclays to persuade Canary Wharf's 11 banks to make a no-strings cash
contribution towards the cost of building the Jubilee Line extension on the
Underground.
The request is understood to be an important shift in the government's
intentions towards the extension. Until now, bankers have feared that the
government was happy for them to make an inadequate offer because it
provided the Treasury with an excuse to cancel the project and save public
expenditure.
Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, and Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds'
chairman, were acting as representatives of Canary Wharf's 11 commercial
banks in a meeting this week with Lord Wakeham, who is chairing a government
committee on London's Docklands.
Lord Wakeham indicated that if the banks made the no-strings offer, the line
would probably be built. A government source said that money had been
allocated for the Jubilee Line, conditional on the banks providing their
share.
The Bank of England is acting as a mediator between the government and the
Canary Wharf banks. Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of
England, has warned the government that, having invited the banks to make a
new Jubilee offer, it must not subsequently dismiss any offer in a fashion
which could appear cavalier. The Bank of England is concerned that any such
rejection would damage the government's reputation in financial centres
abroad.
Bankers warned yesterday that the Jubilee extension to London's Docklands
may yet be scrapped, since it will be difficult to persuade all 11 banks,
nine of which are foreign, to make a no-strings offer.
The banks have already offered Pounds 390m towards the Jubilee's Pounds
1.6bn costs. However, the first two pay-ments totalling Pounds 98m are
conditional on the government moving civil servants to Canary Wharf. The
Treasury is adamant that the funds should not be conditional on relocations
or any form of government support.
Canary Wharf's banks, which have lent Pounds 576m to the project, have to
decide in the coming week whether they can make an unconditional offer.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Census shows fall in London population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POPULATION of London and the six metropolitan counties fell between 1981
and 1991, according to provisional census results published yesterday by the
Office of Populations Censuses and Surveys.
The estimates from last year's census, however, show that the changes were
generally small - with Merseyside falling the most at 5 per cent - and the
inner London boroughs registered a slight increase.
Outside the cities, all but three shire counties increased in population.
Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire, Cornwall and Dorset were the
fastest-growing counties in England and Wales.
Overall, the resident population of England and Wales rose by 1.32m to
50.95m. Two thirds of this was caused by the excess of births over deaths
and the remainder by net immigration. There was a surge in the very youngest
and the oldest: the number of pre-school children rose 422,000 (14 per
cent); and there was an increase of 507,000 (6 per cent) in the number of
people over the retirement ages of 65 for men and 60 for women.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Lord Franks: academic and veteran of many committees -
Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD FRANKS, who died this week at the age of 87, was one of the few
remaining British figures whose career spanned the Second World War and the
post-war reconstruction and who was still active in the 1980s - when he
headed the review committee into British policy towards the Falkland
Islands.
There was a time when no senior committee of inquiry could be formed without
thinking of the possibility of Franks as chairman. His name also came up
whenever a top public job was on offer - whether director-general of the
BBC, secretary general of Nato, or the governorship of the Bank of England.
Yet in spite of this pre-eminence in the world of affairs, he spent much of
his time in universities.
Oliver Franks was born in 1905, the son of a clergyman. The protestant
influence perhaps never left him. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School
and Queen's College, Oxford, where he became a fellow in philosophy. Academe
might have held him for the rest of his life - he had spells at the
universities of Chicago and Glasgow - had it not been for the outbreak of
war. Franks was summoned to the Ministry of Supply and by 1945 was the
permanent secretary there.
After the war he became provost of Queen's, but the call of public life was
never far away. Franks was active in the work that led to the formation of
what is now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD). In 1948 he was appointed British ambassador to Washington.
In politics and life-style he was perhaps closer to Attlee than Churchill
and in 1952 he returned to London where he became chairman of Lloyds Bank.
It is for his chairmanship of committees that he will be mostly remembered.
When the future of higher education was under scrutiny, Franks chaired an
unofficial committee on Oxford which recommended widespread reforms and even
considered the radical possibility of turning Oxford and Cambridge into
entirely postgraduate institutions.
In the early 1970s, he led the committee on the Official Secrets Act which
came down in favour of limiting secrecy and introducing a freedom of
information act. The latter has not yet been implemented.
From 1962 to 1976, Franks was provost of Worcester College Oxford. Shortly
before he took up the post, he had stood for the chancellorship of the
university and in a famous election lost to Harold Macmillan. It was said
that Macmillan would have been happy to reward him with the governorship of
the Bank of England.
Figures like Franks - in so far as there were very many of them - were
thought to have gone out under the premiership of the then Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, who disliked royal commissions and anything like them.
Nevertheless, in the aftermath of the Falklands war it was to Franks that
Mrs Thatcher turned for an investigation of the events that led up to it. He
produced a masterpiece of Civil Service prose which, closely read, was much
more damning of British conduct than was generally realised. It is probably
true that there is unlikely to be a public figure like Franks again.

OFWAT, the water industry regulator, said yesterday that it had failed to
agree on next year's price rises with four of the 19 water companies which
it had asked to restrain prices, Bronwen Maddox writes. The deadline for
responses from the companies was Thursday.
North West Water has asked Ofwat formally to reconsider its judgment. South
West Water, South East Water and Three Valleys Water Services are still
negotiating and have until December to reach a deal.
Two weeks ago Ofwat asked the 19 companies to hold back price increases by
an average 2 percentage points below the level permitted by their licences.
Most of the companies that have reached agreement have persuaded Ofwat that
the restraint should be between 0.5 and 1 point because of extra spending to
meet environmental rules.

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday proposed that the meeting of the
full Russian parliament - the Congress of Peoples Deputies - be postponed
from December to next spring.
At the same time, he has created a new level of power, whose authority is
unclear - a Council of Republican Leaders, bringing together the presidents
of the autonomous republics and regions within Russia. The leaders, meeting
in Moscow on Thursday, called for unity among the Russian peoples, and for
decentralisation of powers to the republics.
The president warned of attempts to create 'parallel structures of power',
at regional and central level.
He said: 'We will be able to strengthen the state, provide stability, ensure
a transformation, only if we have a solid guarantee of the stability of the
institutions of power.'
The proposal to delay the Congress, backed by republican leaders, is an
effort to avoid the crisis which would result from the likely vote of no
confidence in the government from the Congress deputies, most of whom are
against the economic reforms.

<TEXT>
UKRAINE is negotiating a big arms export deal with India which could include
warships as well as spare parts for Soviet-supplied tanks and aircraft.
India, whose fleet includes modern destroyers made at the Nikolayev yards in
Ukraine, has expressed interest in additional naval vessels including
aircraft carriers, according to officials from the two countries. It
currently has two aircraft carriers bought second-hand from Britain.
It is also seeking spares for its modern T-72 tanks and earlier T-55 models,
as well as for its medium-range Antonov An-32 transport aircraft. India
previously bought most of its arms from the Soviet Union.
Mr Sharad Pawar, the Indian minister of defence, was scheduled today to
conclude a visit to Ukraine, where many of the factories and shipyards which
supply those weapons are located. The deal under discussion is expected to
be based largely on barter.
'It has been agreed by both sides that Ukraine will not have any problem
supplying the spare parts,' the Indian embassy said.
Mr Viktor Antonov, Ukraine's armaments minister, said his country's chief
aim was to replace the old Soviet-Indian contract with a direct bilateral
agreement or even three-way arrangements involving Russia as well.
He complained that payment for the An-32s - produced in Ukraine and supplied
to India in the dying days of the Soviet Union - was going to Russia.
'Our factories will not work for free,' Mr Antonov said. 'That is why, as an
independent state, we would like to conclude bilateral agreements.'
Indian trade with the former Soviet Union was facilitated by a rouble-rupee
clearing arrangement. That has now fallen apart and Mr Antonov said it was
difficult to find an alternative.
The Indian deal points to the emergence of Ukraine as an important
international arms supplier. Ukrainian officials denied suggestions this
year that the country paid for 5m tonnes of Iranian oil with weapons.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Italian dock law provokes strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S 144 ports were yesterday paralysed at the start of a four-day strike
by transport unions in protest at the government's decision to push through
a new law abolishing their monopoly on dock labour.
The move to convert into law the previous bill on abolishing the closed shop
and opening the way to greater private-sector participation in the ports
followed action against Italy by the European Commission on competition
grounds.
The Commission became involved in the long-running battle between dock
unions and private-sector port operators after the latter protested to
Brussels that the monopoly breached EC competition rules.
The festering conflict has periodically erupted in violence in Genoa,
Italy's biggest port, where private-sector interests are being given greater
flexibility in running dock activities. Separately, a subsidiary of the Fiat
group is managing a huge new container facility at Voltri, west of Genoa,
due to open next year.
Earlier this week, hundreds of self-employed lorry drivers drove through
Genoa to demonstrate against the monopoly.
Transport unions claim the decision to convert the reform bill into a decree
law, bypassing parliamentary debate, is undemocratic. However, support for
their stand outside militant strongholds like Genoa is thought to be
limited.
The Italian government has decided to leave unchanged for another year the
current structure of the television industry, split among the three
state-controlled channels of RAI TV and the private concessions dominated by
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest media group, Robert Graham writes from
Rome.
This will allow time for a more measured assessment of the role of state
television at a time of financial uncertainty and political change.

FT  17 OCT 92 / EC agrees deal on maternity protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community maternity directive, providing minimum protection for
pregnant women at work, has finally been agreed after several weeks of
wrangling.
The Italian government, which was holding out for a better deal, is likely
to abstain on the directive, which means that it can be passed at a meeting
on Monday, hours before the directive was due to lapse.
If the Italians decide not to abstain, the directive will still be passed,
as the European Commission has accepted a compromise which was agreed
yesterday.
The compromise lays down that the EC's social affairs council will prepare a
report on the directive after four years and the European Commission will
present an evaluation and, if necessary, a proposal for review no later than
five years after the directive is adopted.
The directive will improve protection in only a few countries - including
Britain - but it has been accepted by most member countries as better than
nothing at all.
The original generous provisions for maternity pay which had been proposed
by the European Commission were watered down to a right to receive 14 weeks'
pay at a level no lower than statutory sick pay.
However, the new deal will improve employment protection for British women,
by requiring employers to keep open a job for a woman who has a child
regardless of how long she has been employed.
At present in the UK, protection only applies after two years' continuous
employment. Women are then entitled to six weeks' maternity leave on 90 per
cent of full pay and a further 12 weeks on maternity benefit of Pounds 46.30
a week.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KEY amendments to Germany's constitution, granting both chambers of the
national parliament sweeping powers to oversee and propose changes to draft
legislation for the European Community, have been given the green light in
Bonn.
The changes were approved by the joint constitutional commission,
representing both Bundestag and Bundesrat, and all the political parties in
the parliament.
The two parliamentary chambers can now insist that the German government
present all Community legislation to special EC committees - and that it
must take the committees' views into account in its subsequent Brussels
negotiations.
German parliamentarians believe the plan would give them even more powers to
control Brussels' decision-making than those currently enjoyed by Britain
and Denmark, which have hitherto been the two member states with the
toughest controls.
The move represents a big shift in German thinking towards the EC, in favour
of national control of European legislation, as practised in London and
Copenhagen, rather than multi-national control through the European
Parliament.
'The constitutional commission is not entitled to issue directives. . . on
strengthening the powers of the European Parliament, but it can ensure that
the actions and policies of the German representative in Europe are
subjected to more intensive parliamentary control,' the commission announced
yesterday.
The amendments would set up a European Union Committee of the directly
elected German Bundestag, and a European chamber of the Bundesrat, in which
the 16 German federal states are represented.
German parliamentarians say their committees will be bound to back all
measures promoting 'democracy and federalism' in Europe, in line with the
rest of the German constitution. The British and Danish EC oversight
committees have tended rather to resist moves towards greater European
integration.
The constitutional changes will eventually have to gain two-thirds support
in both houses of parliament, but they already enjoy the necessary
cross-party backing to do so.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Spain seeks EFA postponement: UK worried about cost of
delays to European fighter project
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN has told its partners in the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) that
production should be postponed 'by some years' because of budget pressures
and the changed strategic environment.
However, it said that it still wanted to pursue its collaboration with
Britain, Germany and Italy on producing a joint aircraft.
The Italian government has also underlined the constraints on committing new
funds to the fighter.
The UK hopes to clarify the situation when defence ministers attend a
meeting of Nato's nuclear planning group in Scotland next week.
Italy and Spain currently occupy the middle ground between Germany, which
wants to scrap the current Pounds 20bn project in favour of a smaller
collaborative fighter, and Britain, which wants to stick to the EFA design.
The four partners agreed in August to continue working on prototypes but to
put off further development contracts until reviews on industrial costs and
military requirements were completed.
More than Pounds 5bn of the Pounds 8bn allocated to development has been
spent.
The Spanish Defence Ministry said it wanted to extend the freeze on new
contracts.
British officials accept that plans to bring the new fighter into service in
1998 have now become unrealistic. That schedule would require committing
funds to set up production around the middle of next year.
Although the initial sums involved would be relatively modest, this now
appears difficult to achieve, with all four partners - including Britain -
facing severe pressures on public spending.
Britain is concerned that further delays may add to the fighter's eventual
cost. Under the current programme, production orders would be placed in
1995. Later production would add to the problems faced by British Aerospace
in filling the gap between the current Tornado programme and EFA.
Spain's Defence Ministry is facing a cut of almost 10 per cent in real terms
in its 1993 spending, under a restrictive budget going through parliament.
'We remain interested in EFA for political, technological and military
reasons but in the present economic climate we are literally giving the
project all that we can and there is simply no more money available,' the
ministry said.

help lift Dow

<TEXT>
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH FRESH declines in IBM and Philip Morris depressed US stock markets
in the morning, demand related to the afternoon expiration of stock-index
options and futures helped share prices end mostly firmer, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down only 0.27 at
3,174.41, well off its lows for the day when it had been 32 points lower.
Secondary indices performed much better, with the more broadly based
Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finishing up 2.12 at 411.72, the Amex composite up 1.70
at 367.33 and the Nasdaq composite up 3.97 at 582.61. Turnover on the NYSE
was heavy at 234m shares. Rises outpaced declines by 945 to 803.
The economic fundamentals remained bearish, including an unexpected widening
in the trade deficit and a 0.2 per decline in September industrial
production, and the market was also troubled by another rise in bond yields.
Prices picked up during the afternoon, however, as trading linked to
stock-index futures and options expirations had a positive impact on stocks.
The story of the day, however, remained the weakness in IBM and Philip
Morris which, along with Westinghouse (which also fell sharply), accounted
for most of the losses on the Dow.
IBM ran into heavy selling from the outset, plunging to new lows for the
year as the negative reaction to the company's third quarter performance
intensified. By the close IBM had fallen Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 3/4 in
turnover of 5.6m shares.
Philip Morris suffered under a stampede of sellers, dropping Dollars 2 1/2
to Dollars 77. 1/4 in turnover of 12m shares, although there were signs of
buying support when it shares reached Dollars 75 3/8 . The stock has been
sold on disappointing news about domestic cigarette sales.
Westinghouse was also a feature, falling Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 11 3/4 in
turnover of 5.8m shares on concern that problems at the company's credit
unit could continue to affect earnings.
Airlines were markedly firmer on hopes that the price war may be coming to
an end. Delta rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 57 3/4 , UAL put on Dollars 2
3/4 at Dollars 116 3/4 , and AMR firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 59 1/2 .
Cray Research fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 20 on the news that the company
plans to cut 65 jobs.
On the Nasdaq market, Apple rose Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 49 in turnover of
4m shares in the wake of a 23 per cent surge in fiscal fourth quarter
profits to 81 cents a share. The company also reported strong sales of its
PowerBook notebook computers, and announced plans for an aggressive new
product release schedule for the coming fiscal year.
Everex Systems dropped Dollars  5/16 to Dollars  15/16 after the company
estimated it would report a loss of Dollars 35m in the fourth quarter which
ended in early August and revealed that it was in violation of some loan
agreements.
Canada
TORONTO stocks finished stronger, buoyed by recoveries in the precious
metals and transportation sectors.
The TSE 300 climbed 11.56 to 3207.7 on volume of 29.54m shares valued at
CDollars 259 million. Advances outstripped declines 274 to 256 with 265
issues unchanged.

FT  17 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Milan's recent rise perplexes the
analysts - Haig Simonian asks whether this is the start of a long-awaited
recovery, or just a technical rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big question mark is keeping Italy's equity analysts and investors awake
at nights. Does this week's sharp recovery in the Milan stock market signal
the long-awaited turning point after its long decline or is it just a
technical rebound?
'More mileage in Milan?,' asks Ms Marie-Christine Keith of County NatWest in
London, in her latest market briefing. The consensus among analysts is that
the latest surge in share prices, which saw the Comit index jump by 20.13
points or 5.1 per cent to 417.70 this week, is largely technical, supported
by a smattering of special situations.
But a few brokers believe that the climb could turn into a stampede if
sentiment among Italian investors swings in favour of equities.
The main reason for the scepticism is that fundamentals remain very poor.
'Judging by the surge in prices, you'd think Italy had turned the corner,'
says Ms Keith.
This week saw some parliamentary progress on the government's 1993 budget
plans, while there was only a lukewarm response to the general strike called
by union leaders. But the Italian economy is hardly out of the woods.
Even assuming that the budget is approved by the end of next month, the
prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, will remain on a knife edge. His
successful use of confidence motions to pass legislation has shown that
members of parliament are unwilling to topple the government. But with a
majority of just 16 seats in the lower house, his coalition remains at risk.
Short-term interest rates have edged down, raising expectations of a cut in
the Bank of Italy's discount rate. However, the Bank will not want to risk a
run on the lira, and analysts do not expect a reduction before the budget is
passed. Long-term interest rates remain high, reflecting continuing concerns
about currency risk and rising inflation.
Devaluation will help some companies' earnings next year. Mr Massimo Cenci,
of the Milan brokers Milla-Sommariva, thinks that the market has not paid
enough attention to the potential boost. One leading bank estimates that
gross operating profits should rise by 20 per cent in 1993 thanks to the
currency's fall. But other analysts think the outlook for profits remains
bleak. 'The first half has been awful and we know what to expect for the
year,' says one.
Mr Sergio Pigoli, of Pastorino in Milan, is particularly bearish about the
overall economic outlook. He admits that devaluation will help a handful of
companies such as Benetton and Eridania, which produce partly outside Italy,
and are heavy exporters. Insurers with strong foreign earnings such as Ras
and Generali also stand to gain.
However, higher inflation on account of the devaluation, high interest rates
and a slowing economy will have a 'dramatic effect' on corporate earnings
next year, he says. Combined with the new tax on companies' shareholders'
funds, there will be a 'drastic cut' in profits.
Why then has the market risen so strongly? The cause is partly technical.
Though turnover went up, especially in mid-week, the previous low volumes
have exaggerated the climb in prices. Moreover, many professionals have been
short of stock. 'Until recently, the market was oversold,' says Mr Pigoli.
Milan has also regained some of the speculative fizz that evaporated over
the summer, when negative news like Moody's decision to downgrade the
state's credit rating and the bungled handling of the Efim liquidation
seriously undermined the country's credibility.
Since then, the market has received a fillip from privatisation news and
plans to suspend capital gains tax for one year. Speculative trading is most
active in privatisation stocks, notably Credito Italiano and Nuovo Pignone.
Yesterday, shares in Credito Italiano were suspended for an excessive price
rise of 9.3 per cent, following news late on Thursday that its parent Iri
would hold a competitive, international auction for the sale of a stake in
the bank.
Apart from real or imagined privatisation candidates, Milan's 'special
situations' also include a host of private-sector companies in which
investors expect a change in ownership.
Fiat tops the list. The admission by its chairman, Mr Gianni Agnelli, that
the company may have to sell non-strategic holdings, such as Rinascente, the
department stores group, Toro, the insurance company or the Cogefar-Impresit
construction concern has powered a surge in their share prices.
Fiat's stock has also risen on the back of perpetual rumours about a deal
with a Japanese car maker, Toyota being the name which crops up the most.
Though regularly denied by all concerned, such gossip has pushed Fiat's
share price up by 6.3 per cent this week.
Other stocks in the spotlight include Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, Italy's
biggest private-sector bank. Confirmation that two of the five members of
its shareholders' pact want to sell has fuelled speculation about a possible
takeover. Questions have also been raised about the future of Grassetto, the
construction group controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Sicilian
property tycoon still languishing in a Milanese jail on alleged corruption
charges.
However, few analysts believe that speculation is enough to keep the market
rising. 'It's not yet a real turnround,' says Mr Michael Ierubino, of Milan
broker Murchio. 'All we've seen is a return of domestic bargain-hunters
based partly on bullish views about the suspension of capital gains tax.'
Ms Keith agrees. 'There will be a consolidation since the the market has
gone up too far, too fast,' she says.
Rather than expecting the bourse to fall back to last month's most depressed
levels, analysts believe that shares will give up only part of their recent
gains. After all, foreign buyers may still be cautious, but Italian equities
have now become even cheaper in foreign currency terms thanks to the lira's
fall.

FT  17 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UK base rate cut fails to lift
continental bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS of a further cut in interest rates in the UK failed to enliven
continental bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT traded quietly as options expired, the DAX index rising 8.18 to
1,461.61, up 1.5 per cent on the week.
In carmakers, where downgradings have been rife recently, Daimler led with a
DM5.50 gain at DM528 but BMW got more comment with a rise of DM4.50 to
DM458.50 as BZW put the stock on its 'buy' recommendation list after four
weeks of relative underperformance.
RWE, in utilities, closed DM4 higher at DM383.50, helped by Thursday's DM1
rise in its dividend. But in engineers, where the industry association was
gloomy in statements both on Thursday and yesterday, MAN dropped DM8 to
DM250 after news of a big fall in its order book inflow.
PARIS rose to the day's highs on the back of the UK rate cut but reports,
quickly denied, that President Francois Mitterrand had been taken ill and a
poor start on Wall Street took it to the day's lows just before the close.
The CAC-40 finally ended up 14.16 at 1,664.18 after a high of 1,683.73 and a
low of 1,650.64, in improved turnover of FFr1.9bn.
Euro Disney fell another FFr4.70 or 6.3 per cent to FFr69.75 on selling by
UK traders following a negative report in a UK newspaper and a statement
from Euro Disney's chairman that remarks about help from Walt Disney had
been taken out of context.
Moulinex dropped another FFr9.35, or 10.4 per cent to FFr80.65 as analysts
decided that the company's real first-half loss was nearer FFr50m than the
FFr11m reported late on Thursday and reduced their earnings forecasts
accordingly. Dealers reported heaving selling from UK fund managers who had
large positions in the stock.
STOCKHOLM eased in thin trading and the Affarsvarlden General index fell 0.7
to 661.6, down just under 2 per cent on the week, in turnover of SKr282m
after SKr364m.
B shares in Modo dropped SKr17 or 17 per cent to SKr83 after the forestry
group revealed an eight-month pre-tax loss of SKr811m. Trelleborg's
eight-month pre-tax profit fall of 98 per cent to SKr11m was in line with
expectations, and the B shares eased SKr0.50 to SKr49.
BRUSSELS was supported by interest rate-sensitive shares but Petrofina
weighed heavily on the market. Petrofina dropped as low as BFr7,470 on a
series of negative news reports before closing down BFr130 at BFr7,600. The
Bel20 index rose 2.66 to 1,094.45, little changed on the week.
ZURICH was prepared to go higher but a weaker Wall Street opening brought
the SMI index off its highs to close up 5.5 at 1,883.5, a fraction better on
the week. MADRID's rise on the day, 2.78 to 193.96 in the general index,
restored what it had lost earlier in the week.
AMSTERDAM ended mixed in thin trading, as selling from the options market
and Wall Street pulled some share prices down. The CBS Tendency index fell
0.6 to 105.5, down 2.1 per cent on the week.
HELSINKI bought on the bad news, and on lower domestic interest rates, the
Hex index rising 11.4 to 622.1, up 2.3 per cent on the week. The banks and
finance index was up 6.4 per cent on the day after several banks reported
large interim losses on Thursday.
VIENNA's ATX index gained 3.31 to 783.01, up less than 1 per cent on the
week. The expiry of October futures and options contracts enlivened the
market.

FT  17 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses ground in
low volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN overnight fall on Wall Street and diminished hopes of a co-ordinated
interest rate cuts by Germany, US and Japan, depressed investors, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Share prices lost ground on late index-linked selling and the Nikkei average
fell 258.68 to 17,369.81, but was 1.8 per cent higher on the week. The index
rose to the day's high of 17,617.15 on buying by public funds, but saw a low
of 17,300.50 in late trading on a fall in the futures market.
Volume rose to 220m shares from 192m. Losers led gainers by 601 to 316 with
181 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 13.38 to
1,313.27 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose just 0.03 to 1,055.53.
Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said that the recent low
volume reflected the view that share prices are too high for aggressive
buying, with the outlook on the economy still weak. On the other hand, with
public funds waiting to buy at the lower end, investors are wary of selling
heavily.
High-technology issues were depressed on weak IBM earnings overnight. NEC
plunged Y19 to Y706 and Hitachi lost Y14 to Y748. Pioneer Electronic fell
Y180 to Y2,870 on rumours of sharply lower interim earnings than originally
expected.
China-related stocks were active ahead of the Emperor Akihito's visit to
China on October 23. Yaohan Japan, the retail chain, rose Y70 to Y1,450 and
Bandai, the toy maker, gained Y40 to Y2,650.
Profit-taking pushed down pharmaceutical and chemical issues, which have
been popular on the Aids and Interferon themes. Inabata fell Y20 to Y1,140
and Green Cross declined to Y30 to Y1,530.
Leading large capital issues which were previously bought on speculation of
buying by public funds, fell on profit taking. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
lost Y11 to Y563 and Kawasaki Steel fell Y1 to Y295.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 78.83 to 19,071.33 in volume of 10.5m shares.
Roundup
THERE was only one serious winner in the region yesterday.
HONG KONG attacked the 6,000 level again, but pulled back on profit-taking
to close with the Hang Seng index 71.69 higher at 5,985.33, 6.9 per cent
higher on the week.
Aggressive rotational buying by overseas institutions swept up property and
utility laggards including Cheung Kong and Hongkong Telecom, which rose by
3.3 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively.
AUSTRALIA continued its week-long fall, the All Ordinaries index closing
19.3 lower at 1,419.8, its lowest close since March 1991, and 3.2 per cent
lower on the week. Turnover was at the highest level of the week, with
ADollars 270m worth of shares traded.
NEW ZEALAND ended marginally lower the NZSE-40 index ending 3.92 down at
1,373.95 in turnover of Dollars 18m.
Lion Nathan, a star performer over most of this year, ended 11 cents down at
NZDollars 4.20. Its exposure to the Australian economy, an increasingly
bitter legal wrangle over its purchase of National Brewing from ACIL and
rumours of an earnings downgrade by one New Zealand broker were blamed.
TAIWAN finished lower but financials were up on moderate buying in three
state-run commercial banks. The weighted index closed 21.84 lower at
3,707.18, but up 2.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of TDollars 18.8bn
after TDollars 23.4bn.
BOMBAY's brokers went back to a trading boycott after more than 200 tax
officials raided the offices of over 20 brokers, because of their suspected
involvement in Bombay's stocks and securities scandal.
They said that they had stopped trading because they were not sure whether
deals would be honoured. On Thursday, the BSE had registered its fourth
consecutive decline, closing 19.18 lower at 3,086.45.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Base rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIMING and the size of yesterday's cut in base rates from 9 per cent to
8 per cent took dealers by surprise.
Pressure had been mounting all week for a reduction in domestic rates but
the market was anticipating only a half point cut. When no announcement came
at 10am - the Bank of England's usual time for signalling base rate changes
 -speculation dwindled.
Shortly after midday the Bank announced that houses wishing to use their
borrowing facilities were invited to do so at 2.30pm when the interest rate
would be 8 per cent, one point lower than the rate at which the Bank last
lent to the money markets.
The previous rate cut was on September 22 when Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, ordered a 1 percentage point drop within days of pulling out of
the European exchange rate mechanism. Yesterday's cut takes UK base rates 1
1/2 points lower than Germany's Lombard rate.
The government's decision to cut rates was widely interpreted as a panic
reaction at the end of a week in which, as one dealer put it, '98 per cent
of the population turned against the government'.
Many believed the government would wait until the Autumn statement in
November to announce another cut. However, the political pressure for the
government to act, following a string of dismal economic indicators and the
announcement that 31 coal mines were to close, became overwhelming.
Short sterling futures bounced 50 basis points immediately, with the
December contract moving to discount a further  1/2 point cut by its expiry.
At the close, the futures market was discounting rates of just over 7 per
cent by the end of the year.
The day's shortage was Pounds 500m. The Bank operated in new bands buying a
total of Pounds 173m of bills in bands 1 and 2 at 7 7/8 per cent. It also
lent Pounds 350m to the market at a rate of 8 per cent for seven days.
Cash money market rates, dropped eratically lower. The three-month sterling
interbank rate was quoted at 8 3/32 per cent from 8 1/2 before the Bank's
signal of an easing during its midday market operations.
Further along the curve one year money was quoted at 7 7/16 per cent down
from 8 3/16 per cent.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound resilient as rates are cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING fell two pfennigs immediately after the Bank of England signalled a
one point cut in base rates, but bounced back to close at DM2.4475, writes
Emma Tucker.
Dealers were not convinced that the currency's apparent resilience would
last and said they expected further falls next week.
The market had already discounted at least a half point cut in UK base
rates, which meant that much of the shock of the one point cut in rates to 8
per cent was absorbed.
However, dealers felt the latest cut indicated a shift in the government's
approach to economic policy. Recent signals on policy have been mixed and
the market has been unsure whether the government intends to give priority
to the exchange rate or the domestic economy.
'The government has sent a signal to the foreign exchange markets that its
policy, if there is one, is to focus more on domestic growth than the
exchange rate. That is not something that foreign investors will like,' said
Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The market is now discounting 7 per cent base rates by the end of the year,
which will exert further downward pressure on the currency. In addition, the
recent high volatility of the pound means that investors are demanding a
higher risk premium on the currency, also likely to push it lower.
Sterling had already shed over five pfennigs this week even before
yesterday's rate cut was announced. The loss was prompted by the worsening
economic and political situation in the UK which convinced the market that
an easing was inevitable.
However, veiled attempts by the government and Bank of England to defuse the
rate cut rumours had put the market off the scent in recent days. Thus,
according to dealers, yesterday's cut had a whiff of panic about it.
The pound closed 1 1/2 pfennigs lower on the day, and was over 7 pfennigs
lower than at the beginning of the week. Against the dollar it closed down
over four cents at Dollars 1.6570.
The dollar shrugged off poor trade figures in European trading to end
slightly firmer against the D-Mark. It was mainly boosted by by the rate cut
in the UK. Dealers argued that the cut would put pressure on other European
countries to ease monetary policy which in turn would keep up the pressure
on the Bundesbank to cut rates sooner rather than later.
In London the dollar closed higher against the D-Mark at DM1.4765 compared
with Thursday's close of DM1.4475.
Other European currencies were overshadowed by the reaction of the
free-floating pound to the base rate cut.

tumble to low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday tried to quell Wall
Street rumours about its financial health by announcing that it was in
appliance with all covenants of its Dollars 6bn revolving credit agreement
and that its debt has received investment grade ratings.
In spite of the announcement, shares in Westinghouse tumbled Dollars 1 1/2
yesterday to a 52-week low of Dollars 11 3/4 . The stock closed at Dollars
14 3/4 on Monday.
Investors have been skittish about the stock since late Monday, when
Westinghouse announced an unexpected Dollars 155m pre-tax charge against
third-quarter earnings.
Earlier this week, Westinghouse's debt rating was downgraded by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the US credit ratings agency to reflect the continuing problems at
the financial services subsidiary. S&amp;P said, however, that the lower ratings
also reflect 'weak operating performance at the parent company and the
uncertain prospects'.

LORD KADOORIE, the chairman of the China Light utility, is to retire in
December after holding the post for 57 years, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong.
Lord Kadoorie, 93, will be joined in retirement by group managing director
Sir William Stones, 69, who has served for 18 years.
Lord Kadoorie helped lead Hong Kong's transformation from a colonial
backwater to an international trading powerhouse. He rebuilt China Light
after Japan's Second World War occupation of Hong Kong, starting with a
single turbine, into a group with power sales last year of HKDollars 11.9bn
(USDollars 1.54bn).
Lord Kadoorie will be succeeded by Sir Sidney Gordon, 75, who has been
associated with the company for 45 years.

FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: More Pratt &amp; Whitney cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARLOUS state of the US commercial aviation industry was underscored
yesterday by Pratt &amp; Whitney's decision to expand and accelerate its planned
job cuts to 7,500 by the middle of next year from 5,000 by 1995.
Pratt &amp; Whitney, the aero-engine manufacturing division of United
Technologies, said it was responding to pressures from declining new
commercial engine deliveries next year.
Aircraft manufacturers have slashed their combined 1993 production plans to
632 aircraft from 801.
Largely as a result, Pratt &amp; Whitney said its manufacturing volume for all
engine models would be 21 per cent below 1992 levels.
In spite of the increase in job cuts, the company does not expect to incur
additional charges.
Earlier this year, United Technologies took charges of Dollars 1.5bn to
cover restructuring moves and environmental costs.
A company spokesman said some flexibility had been built into the earlier
restructuring plans.
In addition, many of the new job cuts are expected to come from hourly
workers, who are less costly to lay off than salaried employees.
Shares in United Technologies barely moved on the news yesterday morning.
In a letter to employees, Mr James O'Connor, Pratt &amp; Whitney's president
said the reductions 'reflect drastically weakening industry conditions'.
Mr O'Connor declared: 'Bankrupt airlines, too much capacity and the
resulting fare wars are dragging down airline profits. These conditions are
forcing airlines to reschedule their large commercial airplane and engine
orders.'
The company's spares business was also under pressure, Mr O'Connor said,
with volumes about 25 per cent below 1990 levels.
In addition, Pratt &amp; Whitney's military fighter engine business has plunged
to about 100 engines in 1993 from about 700 engines a year in the early
1980s.

GENERAL Motors, the troubled US automobile group, said yesterday it expected
to cut losses in the third quarter by at least 20 per cent compared with the
Dollars 1.06bn deficit it suffered in the July-September period of 1991.
It added, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that the
losses would be within the range of the leading securities analysts.
Wall Street has been predicting losses of between Dollars 550m and Dollars
1bn, with serious red ink in the group's North American automotive
operations outweighing profits in European vehicles and its finance,
information services and aerospace divisions.
The company said said earnings from its information subsidiary, Electronic
Data Systems, should be 'consistent with the year-to-year earnings trend'
previously reported. In the second quarter, the business recorded a 12 per
cent rise in net income.
Earnings from the aerospace group GM Hughes would be 'substantially
improved' from the year-ago level.
Ford Motor, the second largest US auto manufacturer, is also expected to
report third quarter losses while Chrysler, the smallest of the Big Three,
has indicated it will be in the black.

TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
unveiled improved third-quarter earnings and said its semiconductor
operations returned to profitability after 10 consecutive quarters of
losses.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 57m, or 58 cents a share, compared
with a net loss of Dollars 113m or Dollars 1.45 per share in the third
quarter a year ago. Net revenues were Dollars 1.9bn, up from Dollars 1.7bn.
The results for this year's third quarter include a pre-tax charge of
Dollars 10m related to the sale of TI's multi-user minicomputer systems and
services operations to Hewlett-Packard. Last year's third quarter included
restructuring charges of Dollars 55m.
The turnround reflects the success of TI's efforts to increase the
proportion of 'differentiated' or non-commodity types of chip products it
makes and so reduce its vulnerability to the volatilities of the memory chip
market.
TI noted there has been significant improvement in the US semiconductor
market this year, but growth in the world market continued to be restrained
by sluggish economies, especially in Japan.
Revenues for the first nine months of 1992 rose to Dollars 5.4bn from
Dollars 5bn.
Net income was Dollars 170m, or 54 cents, against a loss of Dollars 324m
last year.

WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank, is planning to
sell the Channel Ten television network to a consortium led by CanWest
Global Communications, a Canadian broadcasting group.
Westpac refused to reveal the sale price But Mr Frank Conroy, managing
director, said it was 'commensurate' with the network's ADollars 245m
(USDollars 175m) book value.
Westpac took control of Channel Ten through a debt-for-equity swap last
year. It was forced to do so after the receiver failed to find a buyer. The
network had been in receivership since September 1990.
CanWest, Canada's largest private TV broadcaster, has been associated with
Westpac since last year, when it bought a majority stake in New Zealand's
fledgling TV3 network.

DAIEI, Japan's largest supermarket chain, has seen interim pre-tax profits
fall for the first time in 10 years amid a sharp deterioration of consumer
confidence in Japan.
Daiei said pre-tax profits for the six months to August fell 8.1 per cent to
Y11.5bn (Dollars 95.8m) on a 0.8 per cent rise in sales to Y1,000.1bn.
After-tax profits fell 6.7 per cent to Y4bn.
Full-year pre-tax profits are expected to fall 7.4 per cent to Y25.5bn on
sales up 1.2 per cent to Y2,050bn.
Takashimaya, a leading Japanese department store, yesterday revealed a sharp
drop in interim profits and said full-year sales and profits would fall for
the first time ever.
Pre-tax profits for the first half fell 53.9 per cent to Y3.4bn on a 4.3 per
cent fall in sales to Y392.9bn. After-tax profits plunged 65.1 per cent to
Y1bn.
Takashimaya said pre-tax profits for the full year would fall 40.1 per cent
to Y8bn on a 2.7 per cent dip in sales to Y817bn.

FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: Wall St turns on Marlboro Man -
Nikki Tait on why Philip Morris shares fell despite higher profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profit surprises from Philip Morris, the tobacco, food and brewing combine,
are about as rare as the sight of the Marlboro Man without his stetson. So
why did the shares tumble 10 per cent in two days, after the release of
solid third-quarter results?
The reaction has little to do with the bottom-line numbers. Philip Morris
remains a strong cash generator, posting double-digit earnings increases
with enviable regularity. In the third quarter alone it reported a 16.4 per
cent improvement in after-tax profits at Dollars 1.29bn on Dollars 15bn
sales.
Moreover, because of the large amounts of surplus cash which are thrown off
 -reckoned to be around Dollars 20bn over the five years from 1991 to 1995 -
Philip Morris has reinstituted a share buy-back programme. This ate up
almost Dollars 600m during the latest quarter, but helped earnings per share
to rise by an even more impressive 20 per cent.
This scale of advance, said Mr Michael Miles, the company's chairman, should
continue into the fourth quarter. It would, he added, be 'driven by
continued strong performance in our international operations'.
So what is the stock market's problem? It is true that elements of Philip
Morris's food business have had a tough time.
Hot weather, for example, in Europe depressed sales of confectionery - the
US company now owns Europe's Jacob Suchard - while a poor summer across much
of the US contributed to a fall of over 40 per cent in profits at Miller
Brewing.
But the reason for the share price reaction is the changing dynamics of the
domestic tobacco sector. For all Philip Morris' efforts at diversification
into food products and the growth of the international tobacco business,
this remains hugely important. Last year, the domestic tobacco operations
accounted for almost half operating profits, although only one-fifth of
sales.
Demand for cigarettes is on a slowly declining trend in the US, with
shipment volumes falling by about 2.5 per cent a year. But within this
overall pattern, full-priced brands are suffering particularly badly, at the
expense of 'discount' brands.
This trend is usually attributed to the squeeze on consumer spending, and is
particularly problematic for manufacturers like Philip Morris because profit
margins on discount brands - as opposed to established full-price brands -
are lower. This year discount brands account for around 30 per cent of the
US market, against about 19 per cent as recently as 1990.
So concern about how Philip Morris's key full-priced brands - in particular,
Marlboro - may fare is rampant. Recent figures provide some justification:
in the third quarter, for example, Morris's total cigarette shipments were
down by 0.5 per cent, at 53.3bn units, but this masked a 3.8 per cent
decline for premium brands overall, and a 3.9 per cent fall for Marlboro.
For the first nine months the story was similar: a 0.4 per cent fall in
total cigarette shipments, but a 2.9 per cent fall for premium brands and a
slightly larger 3.4 per cent decline for Marlboro.
The shell-shock in Thursday's announcement was that Philip Morris expects a
much larger 10 per cent fall in domestic shipments in the final quarter.
This, in turn, seems to result partly from the group's aggressive defensive
tactics. The shift towards discount brands, according to one analyst,
encouraged Philip Morris to claw extra shelf space by increasing shipping
levels. When retailers baulked at the move, a stock overhang developed,
which will be addressed in the fourth quarter.
Compounding the problem is the strong, but erratic, export demand - notably
from Russia - which is satisfied from domestic factories. Some capacity
problems and manufacturing log-jams have resulted.
But the announcement's real impact was to highlight possible long-term
problems should the discount sector continue its inroads into the tobacco
market.
Most analysts admit the swing to discount products could be a function of
the recessionary climate. But, as Barry Ziegler, analyst with A. G. Edwards,
says: 'There's always the risk that people will become used to generic
brands, and not return to the full-price brands.'
Concerns over Philip Morris's full-price brands have also been exacerbated
by the success of Camel, a competitive product sold by Morris's biggest
rival RJR Nabisco.
Finally, although the company denied a recent move by its top US tobacco
marketing executive to Philip Morris International implied either a shake-up
or a shift in strategy, some observers have sensed the management changes
could signal growing concern about Marlboro's performance.
Even so, several analysts said Thursday's stock-market reaction was
overdone. With the company still confident of 20 per cent earnings growth,
it was - said one pundit - too soon for a fundamental reassessment. After
all, in these straitened times, such numbers are something of a rarity.

origin countries has pushed domestic prices much higher, but this has not
resulted in very active trading in consuming markets - most buyers prefer to
wait and see. There were hardly any offers available from Brazil although it
is the peak season. White pepper was offered at USDollars 1,550 a tonne

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Mining Closures: TUC hopes to take lead in protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE general council of the Trades Union Congress will today try to place
itself at the head of the protest aimed at reversing the government's
pit-closure decision and link its campaign to a broader initiative to combat
unemployment.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said the
British people had 'drawn a line in the sand and said 'so far, no further''.
Mr Morris and Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, are
proposing a six-point programme to the TUC to include a mass demonstration
next weekend, a moratorium on pit closures and a Pounds 10bn stimulus to the
economy.
Mr Morris suggested that some of the Pounds 10bn could be raised through a
one-off 'windfall' tax on the profits of the privatised utilities. He said:
'There is a great vacuum of leadership on the economy at the moment and the
TUC must try to fill that and speak for the people of Britain.'
Mr Edmonds proposed a national recovery forum to discuss a short-term
recovery package. 'We need a spark to re-ignite the British economy,' he
said. He pointed as a model to the Pounds 20bn stimulus that the Japanese
government was applying to its economy.
Mr Edmonds said the government and all sides of industry should set aside
their political and ideological differences to establish such a recovery
programme. Mr Morris and Mr Edmonds are seeking a meeting with the senior
management of the electricity generation industry and British Gas.
Some union leaders believe the response of both the TUC and the Labour party
to the pit closures has been inadequate. They believe there is now a real
chance to force a U-turn in government policy and perhaps even to bring down
the government.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REBELLION among Tory MPs over the British Coal closures accelerated
yesterday - giving Labour a real chance of engineering a defeat for the
government in next Wednesday's Commons debate.
The list of Conservatives publicly questioning, if not openly opposing, the
decision already exceeds the 11 necessary to wipe out the government's
21-strong majority in the Commons.
It is not yet clear whether the extra help for miners announced last night
by Mr John Major - coupled with strong lobbying expected this weekend by
government business managers - will stop enough from abstaining or voting
against the government next week.
The two most vociferous Tory opponents, Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and
Spen) and Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme) said they hoped the pit closure
policy would be overturned.
Fresh recruits yesterday who might yet defy the government whips include Mr
David Tredinnick (Bosworth), who called for a 'breathing space' before pits
close.
Mr James Cran (Beverley) said the level of protest from his constituents had
been unprecedented. Mr James Pawsey (Rugby and Kenilworth) said: 'The speed
with which these proposals have been brought forward is precipitous.'
Other Tories who have objected in varying degrees to the closures include Mr
William Cash (Stafford), Mr David Nicholson (Taunton), Sir Rhodes Boyson
(Brent North), Mr John Carlisle (Luton North), Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend
East), Mr David Knox (Staffordshire Moorlands), Mr John Biffen (Shropshire
North), Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield), Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton)
and Mr Michael Clark (Rochford).

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Mining Closures: Only 12 vacancies at the Jobcentre -
Richard Donkin reports on the mood in Seaham where the town's last pit
ceased production yesterday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST storms of the winter were sending waves crashing over the outer
piers of Seaham harbour yesterday as the winding gear of the town's
remaining pit winched up men on the final day of production. Facing
seawards, the blank expressions of the miners gave no hint that they were
witnessing the end of Seaham's industrial heritage.
Mining breathed life into this Durham town. Before the last century it was a
small rural settlement, but coal production led to the creation of a railway
and a bustling harbour. Foundries were built and a bottle works thrived for
a time. The industry has gone and the Vane Tempest colliery is the last of
the town's mines.
The bodies of the 163 men and boys who died in the town's great colliery
disaster in 1880 are still entombed in sealed underground workings at the
old Seaham colliery. Now Seaham, with a population of about 35,000, is
withering with its dying pits.
Seaham has seen better days, but it has never been a prosperous town. People
used to search the beach for coal when times were hard. The sand is still
black - so moonlike that the makers of a new science-fiction film used it as
the backdrop for a desolate planet.
In spite of their sadness at the pit closure, the townspeople remain
stoically cheerful, retaining a sense of humour. Mr Ron Wood, who runs the
franchise of Swinton Insurance, in Church Street, the main shopping centre,
says: 'Personally I think the future for the area is tourism. Lord Byron
used to live here. Mind you Byron hated the bloody town. I can't blame him.'
This week had been 'make a will week' at Swinton's - but there had been no
takers.
Church Street sells everything necessary to sustain life, but little more.
The few shops selling electrical goods are anxious about their prospects now
all the pits have gone.
Mrs Joan Frail, manager of the Northern Electric shop, is offering deferred
payments until next March on some goods with a 20 per cent down payment. In
a further promotion the shop is offering vouchers of Pounds 100 to Pounds
200 that can be used against holidays for customers who buy on credit.
'But if people can't afford to go on holiday in the first place it isn't
much good,' she says. Her own company has just made 98 people redundant in
its retail division. 'At the end of the year it's possible that more shops
will close,' she says. 'I just hope that the Seaham branch of Northern
Electric isn't one of them.'
The town's bakeries - selling a staple food - continue to do a brisk trade.
Mrs Lorna Huntley, married to a retired miner, and an assistant at
Nicholson's bakery for the past 22 years, says: 'We make good bread that
people can still afford. Our boss understands people's problems and hasn't
increased prices for one and a half years. The bread is selling well but
people are buying less confectionery and cakes.'
Foggin's newsagents also looked busy. 'The local papers are going well
because they have all the jobs in them,' says Mrs Dorothy Carr, the owner.
Unlike most of the UK at the end of the 1980s, house prices never jumped
much in Seaham so they didn't drop much either, says Mr David Shaw, who runs
a town-centre estate agency. Average house prices are about Pounds 25,000.
Business is slow, he says: 'The house market is so bad that I don't think
the closure of the pit could make much difference.'
Seaham's building societies are looking forward to a rush of deposits when
miners bank their redundancy payments, but mortgage lending is low. 'These
days house buyers tend to take a mortgage protection policy as a matter of
course,' says Mrs Janice Ferguson, manager of the Northern Building Society.
The Vane Tempest closure had not been unexpected, she says. The husband of
Mrs Irene Henderson, one of the society's officers, has just taken
redundancy at the pit. She has no idea where he might get another job.
Not all businesses are doing badly. The Zodiac Video centre next to the
parish church is part of an expanding chain. The most popular video this
week is Cape Fear. Mrs Margaret Drysdale, the manager, says: 'People have
nothing else to do. They probably just watch the telly.'
The small jewellers' shop in Church Street gives the impression that there
must be some demand for luxury items in the town, until you go inside and
talk to Mr Wilfred Dunn, the proprietor. 'I don't sell much,' he says. 'It's
the repairs that keep me busy. You can't sell luxury goods here.'
This is confirmed by the experience of Mrs Carole Shaw, manager of
Barnardo's second-hand shop. She described business as brisk, with the
average price of clothes in the shop between Pounds 2 and Pounds 3.
Mr Eddie Owsnett, who owns a pork and beef butcher's in the town, said one
of his specialities in increasing demand
is the 50p savoury dip. This consists of a bread bun, coated with peas
pudding on one side, sage and onion stuffing on the other and containing
meat trimmings in the middle, dipped in gravy and served up hot as a
lunchtime snack.
Mr Allen Brooks, the fishmonger, says: 'A few retired people are moving into
the area from the south, so that could partly compensate for the downturn.
But morale is certainly low in the town.'
Meanwhile, the Seaham Jobcentre has just 12 local jobs on its noticeboard.
The town has about 1,500 people unemployed, but the number of jobless will
increase immediately after the 900 redundancies at the colliery. 'It will
decrease my chances of getting a job by 50 per cent,' says one of the
fishermen digging for worms in the harbour. 'There's nothing else for me to
do but fish.'
But it would be wrong to describe Seaham as a gloomy town. Its people have
suffered too many disappointments to be depressed about the latest blow. 'We
went through a year's pit strike and came through it,' says Mr John Webster,
who runs a wallpaper shop. People have pride in their homes and they still
want to decorate. They have time on their hands.

<TEXT>
A JAPANESE consortium has been awarded a HKDollars 1.6bn (Pounds 123m)
contract for airport-related infrastructure in Hong Kong, in spite of the
continued deadlock between Britain and China in approving financing for the
entire airport project.
Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), leading a consortium including Maeda, Yokogawa
Bridge and Hitachi Zosen, submitted the lowest bid for the Kap Shui Mun
bridge and Ma Wan viaduct project.
It is a combined rail and road structure which will ultimately link Chek Lap
Kok airport on Lantau Island to the mainland via the world's second longest
suspension bridge, the Tsing Ma bridge, which is being constructed by a
consortium led by Trafalgar House of the UK.
The Japanese tender is for a fixed price and compares with the government's
estimate of HKDollars 1.8bn for the project. Announcement of the award
coincided with a press conference held by the Chinese side of the
Sino-British Airport Committee in which it complained about the spiralling
costs of the entire HKDollars 163bn project.
Chinese concerns, focusing on the margin between 1991 costs and current
figures for the airport project, were dismissed by Hong Kong government
officials as unproductive. But the arguments underline the tense reception
Governor Chris Patten is likely to receive when he arrives in Beijing on
Wednesday.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Shake-out in China's leadership: Communist party seeking to
present younger image to the people
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG shake-up of China's leadership is in progress following the retirement
of more than half the Communist party's politburo - the country's leading
decision-making body.
Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, yesterday reported that
eight of the 14 members of the politburo, including President Yang Shangkun,
85, and defence minister Qin Jiwei, 78, had tendered their resignations
during the party's 14th congress.
The newspaper, which generally reflects Beijing's point of view, was silent
on who would replace the eight. There have, however, have been persistent
reports that the party wants to present a younger image to the Chinese
people as well as to the world at large.
Wen Wei Po indicated that old age was the reason for the eight to retire.
But it said the top 'leadership level and the presidium' had given a
positive evaluation of the eight's 'noble character and sterling integrity'.
A front-page commentary in yesterday People's Daily, the official newspaper
of the party, prepared the wider party for a change at the top. It said:
'With the passing of time, quite a few old comrades are getting advanced in
age and finding it hard to shoulder their heavy workload.'
In addition to Yang and Qin it named Wan Li, the 76-year-old head of the
National People's Congress, or parliament; Song Ping, 75; Yao Yilin, 75; Wu
Xueqian, 71; Li Ximing, 66; and Yang Rudai, 66. Song and Yao are on the
politburo's all-powerful standing committee and are regarded as being on the
hardline conservative wing of the party.
Their replacements, and the composition of the standing committee generally,
are being watched closely by Beijing's western diplomatic corps to assess
whether Deng Xiaoping, 88 and the nation's pre-eminent leader, has been able
to increase the number of pro-economic reformers on the standing committee.
This week the party embraced a radical, market-oriented reform programme
which envisages the introduction of free markets and the restructuring of
the country's ailing state industries. It turned its face, however, against
any form of political reform, flatly ruling out 'a western, multi-party,
parliamentary system'.
The politburo is expected to be expanded from its previous complement of 14
to more than 20 people. The expanded number is expected to allow greater
representation by provincial party bosses, including those of Shanghai,
Guangdong, Tianjin, and Shandong, in addition to Beijing.
These provinces have been the engine of Chinese economic growth and their
power has increased significantly. At the same time, analysts said, the
inclusion of more provincial party bosses on the politburo would bring them
further into the policy orbit of Beijing, from which they have been straying
recently.
The party congress is expected to close tomorrow, when a new central
committee will be appointed. It in turn will appoint the politburo and its
standing committee, which might be announced at the same time or on Monday.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Rights activist from Guatemala wins Nobel prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS RIGOBERTA Menchu Tum, the Guatemalan Indian and human rights activist,
yesterday won the 1992 Nobel peace prize.
The Nobel committee said Ms Menchu, a 33-year-old Mayan, stood out 'as a
vivid symbol of peace and reconciliation across ethnic, cultural and social
dividing lines, in her own country, on the American continent and in the
world'.
Ms Menchu is the ninth woman to win the Nobel peace prize. Detained Burmese
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi won the award last year.
Mr Francis Sejersted, chairman of the Nobel committee, said the award to Ms
Menchu - on the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in
the new world - 'was not a coincidence, but it was not the only factor' in
the selection.
Ms Menchu said recently of the anniversary: 'There is nothing to celebrate'
as 'the rights of the Indian people continue to be violated'. She returned
to Guatemala last week and has been travelling around the country speaking
to indigenous groups and supporters.
It remained unclear last night whether she could go to Oslo on December 10
to receive the SKr6.5m (Pounds 688,750) award, diploma and gold medal.
Before she gained international recognition as a human rights activist Ms
Menchu worked in the cotton fields of Guatemala and as a domestic servant
for a wealthy family.
Her mother, father and brother were killed for their involvement in
indigenous rights movements. Fear of suffering the same fate has forced her
to live in self-imposed exile in Mexico City. Ms Menchu said last week she
would use the prize to set up a foundation in her father's memory.
Ms Menchu became an international figure when, in 1983, she published her
biography 'I, Rigoberta,' detailing her experiences in Guatemala's polarised
society.
In the book she told of how, during her time as a domestic servant for a
rich family, she was expected to have sex with the family's sons and was fed
worse than their dog.
'And they gave me a few beans and some hard tortillas. That hurt very much,
that the dog had eaten very well and I didn't deserve the food the dog ate,'
she wrote.
'I, Rigoberta,' now published in 10 languages, brought the plight of
indigenous people to the attention of Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, wife of
French President Francois Mitterrand, who became a strong Menchu supporter.
Mrs Mitterrand accompanied Ms Menchu to Guatemala last year when, for the
first time in a decade, she returned home.
Ms Menchu now works with the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations and
the International Indian Treaty Council and spends much of her time in
Europe.
In 1986 she narrated the film When the Mountains Tremble, a powerful account
of the struggles and suffering of her native Quiche people.
The committee said that in Ms Menchu's social and political work, 'she has
always borne in mind that the long-term objective of the struggle is peace'.
Mr Sejersted conceded that perhaps not all Ms Menchu's civil rights efforts
were conducted peacefully, but as a whole the committee saw her work as
contributing to the development of human rights in a peaceful manner.
Despite her international prominence, the Guatemalan government treats Ms
Menchu as a pariah and accuses her of belonging to the country's leftist
guerrilla movement.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Military leads modernisation march: People's Army is helping
quasi-capitalist development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first exhibit you see on entering the Museum of the People's Liberation
Army is not a tank or missile, but four luxury cars.
Two of them - one of indeterminate manufacture and one Russian - were used
by Chairman Mao Zedong; another, a Skoda, was used by Zhu De, one of China's
great generals of the revolutionary civil war that brought the Communists to
power in 1949. But the one that people queue up to be photographed next to
is the open-roofed and Shanghai-produced Hungqi, or Red Flag, used by Deng
Xiaoping in 1985 when he rode triumphant through Tiananmen Square.
The use of cars may be odd but, along with the 20-foot statue of Mao in the
foyer and giant portraits of Engels, Marx, Lenin and Stalin, they have a
powerful symbolic importance. They underline to visitors the central fact
that the military in China is inseparable from the Communist party.
Indeed, the primary duty of the 3.2m-member People's Liberation Army (PLA)
is to defend the Communist party, a 'duty' it performed in June 1989 when
its tanks and infantry suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen
Square, in the process killing hundreds and possibly thousands of young
people.
Defence of territorial China comes second and is followed by a number of
other directives. The one of most practical importance is to assist in the
development of China through construction and production works.
It was the PLA which 12 years ago laid down the infrastructure for Shenzhen
 -China's most thriving 'special economic zone' on the border with Hong
Kong. In 1991, according to Chinese press reports, the PLA spent more than
25m work days working on 140 key projects in provincial China.
Modernisation of the PLA has been the prime aim of China's leadership since
Deng in the mid-1970s accused the army of being bloated, lax, conceited,
extravagant and inert. And, as the party is inseparable from the PLA, so too
is the PLA's modernisation inseparable from the party's policy for the
quasi-capitalist development of the country.
'The faster China develops its economy, carries out reform and opens its
door to the rest of the world, the more necessary it is to strengthen
national defence,' according to Chi Haotian, PLA chief of staff.
This view was developed in the same newspaper by General Liu Huaqing,
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and the man likely to be
appointed to the highest level of the party, its politburo.
'The modernisation of the military can be seen as a question of life and
death,' the People's Liberation Army Daily quoted him as saying. 'Military
modernisation does not just mean modernisation of weaponry, but without that
nothing else is possible.'
Gen Liu - a close associate of Deng since the 1940s - has spent much of his
career with the Chinese navy, developing it from a force which provided
coastal defence to one with something near long-distance capability.
Western military analysts say there are still weaknesses in its ability to
project Chinese power in the region - air support is poor, as is the navy's
ability to defend itself from air attack - but they respect the intelligence
with which the modernisation of the navy has progressed.
Weaknesses or not, the growth of the navy - which consists of 92 tactical
submarines, one nuclear submarine, 19 destroyers and 37 frigates - has
worried China's neighbours. Its interest in buying a Russian aircraft
carrier from Ukraine (now on hold, western analysts believe) has alarmed
Japan and caused concern in the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, which
all, along with China, lay claim to the Spratly Islands in the South China
Sea.
Gen Liu is expected to use the same energy he devoted to the navy in
modernising the army and the air force; the latter uses dated technology,
although military analysts say it has upgraded air defence capability with
the acquisition of at least 24 SU-27 'Flanker' combat aircraft from Russia.
The army is still over-manned and poorly equipped, trained and led. It is
essentially a peasant army and represents the greatest challenged to China's
military planners.
But the road to modernisation is long. To upgrade quickly China would have
to import western armaments, laying it open to dependence on ideological
foes and incurring huge costs which it is unable to bear.
China's military leaders appear to have decided instead on having a smaller
standing army that is better educated, trained and led. Modernising
equipment will come from selective foreign purchases, which will then be
analysed in China and, if possible, copied.
Gen Liu is at 76 not a young man; it is anyone's guess how long he will have
to oversee the modernisation effort. However, if he succeeds, he may find
that his staff car will join those of Mao, Zhu and Deng in the PLA museum.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Pretoria's amnesty bill defies the ANC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African government yesterday tabled a controversial bill in
parliament which would allow it to grant amnesty and indemnity from
prosecution to political criminals, including members of the state security
forces.
The bill, which has been opposed by the African National Congress (ANC),
could prove a further obstacle to progress in talks on a new constitution.
The ANC opposes the bill because it will allow President FW de Klerk to
indemnify from future prosecution state officials who committed crimes
(including political assassinations) during the apartheid era without either
trying them for their crimes or even disclosing the deeds publicly.
ANC officials have said they support the granting of indemnity, or amnesty
to state officials already serving sentences, but only if such actions are
taken by a multi-racial interim government and not unilaterally by Pretoria,
and only if there is full public disclosure of the crimes for which
indemnity is granted. Under yesterday's bill, disclosure is at the
discretion of the president.
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee made clear yesterday that the government
intended to proceed immediately with granting indemnity to all those who
committed political crimes, from any party or from the state. He said the
legislation was in line with an earlier law which allowed ANC members to
receive indemnity from prosecution without disclosing their crimes publicly.
The president will have the final word on such indemnities. He will be
advised by a panel including at least one judge, but all the panel's members
will be appointed by him.
The ANC has said it would revoke any indemnities granted unilaterally by
Pretoria, and repeal amnesty legislation, if it came to power in
multi-racial elections.
Mr Coetsee was at pains to stress that yesterday's move would not lead to a
general amnesty, as had been feared by the ANC, because the draft law does
not automatically absolve state agents of responsibility for apartheid
crimes and requires them to apply for indemnity from prosecution for
offences (although individuals can apply for indemnity for categories of
offence rather than specific offences).
But Mr Tony Leon, the justice spokesman for the official opposition, the
liberal Democratic party, dismissed this argument, saying the bill was 'a
general amnesty by another name'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO sides in Angola's political crisis were moving towards a compromise
yesterday, easing fears of a return to civil war.
Details of the deal, based on an interim government of national unity
pending a second-round runoff of presidential elections, will be hammered
out in a meeting in the next 48 hours between President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita rebel movement.
The initiative results from intense diplomatic activity by South Africa, the
United Nations and the US and follows the release of election returns
showing Mr dos Santos had failed to secure the 50 per cent majority to avoid
a runoff.
Final official results of the country's first democratic elections will be
published this morning and are expected to show Mr dos Santos won 49.5 per
cent of the vote against 40.6 per cent for Mr Savimbi. In the parliamentary
poll the ruling MPLA won a decisive victory.
The results, which overturned earlier figures showing Mr Dos Santos above
the 50 per cent mark, came after a recount of the blank and void ballot
papers.
Mr Savimbi plunged Angola into crisis two weeks ago when he claimed the
government had rigged the elections. He withdrew his generals from the newly
unified Angolan Armed Forces and made veiled threats of a return to war. An
investigation into the elections turned up evidence of irregularities and
incompetence but failed to support Mr Savimbi's allegations of massive
fraud.
Diplomats said yesterday the deal between the president and the guerrilla
chief had pulled the country back from the brink of renewed conflict. But
they also said it left the deeply divided country in limbo and uncertain of
how Mr Savimbi would act in coming months.
It is unlikely a second round of presidential elections can be organised
within the 30-day period laid down by the electoral laws, and Unita is
certain to demand that the UN plays a bigger role in fresh elections.
Unita officials and Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, have also
said the UN, not the government, must control the election machinery for
fresh polls.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Nigerian leader cracks down on political parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S transition to civilian rule suffered a serious setback yesterday
when the military government nullified the results of last month's
presidential primaries and dissolved the executives of the country's two
political parties.
The decision, prompted by widespread electoral fraud, seems likely to
disrupt the transition timetable which envisaged presidential elections in
December, and a formal handover by President Ibrahim Babangida in early
January.
General Babangida, who seized power in a 1985 coup, took the decision after
a meeting of the Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) had reviewed a report of
the National Electoral Commission.
After an AFRC meeting in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, Gen Babangida said
that caretaker committees would take over administration of the Social
Democratic party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC), while
the electoral commission would draw up new guidelines for the selection of
party candidates.
The AFRC was 'firmly committed to bringing about a viable democracy at all
levels of government in accordance with electoral laws,' Gen Babangida said.
Although most observers agree that electoral fraud discredited the
primaries, the transition process was fundamentally flawed from the start.
In 1987, in the early stages of the programme, thousands of former
politicians and government officials were banned from politics in an
ineffectual attempt to create a 'new breed' of leaders. Two years later the
government presided over the creation of the SDP and the NRC, whose
near-identical manifestos were drawn up by civil servants.
The credibility of the process suffered a further blow when the government
insisted the only way to prevent electoral fraud was to use the open-ballot
system, under which voters line up for counting in front of a poster of
their favoured candidate.
But faced with a choice between taking part in a flawed transition to
democracy or resigning themselves to military rule, many Nigerians
reluctantly opted for the former.
Should Gen Babangida delay the handover there is likely to be widespread
resentment among a civilian population increasingly critical of the
military's mismanagement and government corruption.

ITOCHU Corp, the Japanese trading group, is ploughing Dollars 50m (Pounds
29.2m) into a joint venture plastics plant in India - the largest investment
there by a Japanese company.
The decision is the most positive response to date by Japanese business to
India's economic reform programme. It comes amid evidence of a sharp
increase in planned investment in India by Japanese companies, as well as by
US and European groups.
In the first eight months of 1992 Japanese companies won approval for
investment plans totalling Rs5.3bn (Pounds 110m), against Rs525m for the
whole of 1991. Total foreign investment over the same periods jumped to
Rs28.5bn from Rs5.3bn.
Itochu is investing jointly with Reliance, the large Indian textiles and
chemicals group, in two factories to produce polyethylene and polypropylene
in a project costing about Dollars 400m in total. Each group will take a
25.5 per cent stake, with the remaining capital being raised through a
public offering in India.
Government figures published this week showed India is progressing in
efforts to increase exports to promote growth. In the first five months of
the financial year starting in April exports rose 4.6 per cent in dollar
terms.
Exports are not growing fast enough to cover increases in imports, which
rose 22 per cent, leaving a deficit on the trade account of Dollars 2.3bn.

The MPLA, for its part, is demanding that a more systematic demobilisation
and demilitarisation of Unita's armed forces take place before the runoff.
This is unlikely to occur within six months, as the oncoming rains will make
large parts of the country impassable.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPUBLICAN campaigners claimed yesterday that they still have time to break
into Governor Bill Clinton's commanding polling lead before the US
presidential election on November 3, after President George Bush once again
failed to inflict any appreciable damage on his Democratic rival in Thursday
night's debate.
'We've got over two weeks. That's a long time in politics,' said
Vice-president Dan Quayle.
But Mr Bush appeared more resigned than his ebullient running mate, all but
conceding in Thursday's debate with Mr Clinton and Mr Ross Perot that he
should have handed over the reins to another candidate.
'I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected, but it's
too late,' he said.
Many Republicans have been desperately urging Mr Bush to take his gloves off
in his assault on Mr Clinton, emulating Mr Quayle, who in his debate earlier
this week with Senator Al Gore, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate,
relentlessly attacked Mr Clinton's policies, personality and integrity.
If Mr Bush had any plans to follow this advice, he was quickly cut off by
the audience of 209 uncommitted voters who had been selected to ask the
questions in this second of three encounters between the three main
candidates.
Although he embarked briefly on what has become known as 'the character
issue', criticising Governor Clinton as 'someone who demonstrates and
organises demonstrations in a foreign land when his country is at war, Mr
Bush appeared quickly to decide that this would win him no friends in the
audience.
'The amount of time the candidates have spent in this campaign trashing
their opponents' character and their programmes is depressingly large,' one
questioner complained.
Mr Perot, who stole the show at the first debate last Sunday with his good
humour and folksy phrasing, once again managed the best one-liners, but
appeared to make no headway in convincing undecided voters that he might be
a serious presidential candidate.
Early polling suggested that Thursday's debate had little effect on voting
intentions, and there are few indications that the final debate, on Monday
night, will do any more to dent Mr Clinton's lead. He is comfortably ahead
in 26 states - already enough to ensure victory - and holds the advantage
over Mr Bush in 12 more.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Administration undergoes economic pummelling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration underwent an economic pummelling yesterday as
official figures showed a surge in the trade deficit to Dollars 9bn in
August, the biggest shortfall for two years, and a fall in industrial
production in September for the second month running.
An unexpected slump in exports, which fell 6 per cent in August, was the
main cause of the rise in the trade deficit, the Commerce Department said.
The production figures confirmed the weakness of the US economy, which some
analysts believe is teetering on the brink of a 'triple dip' recession.
The slide in exports, meanwhile, indicated that the positive impact on US
trade of a weak dollar is now outweighed by the contractionary effects of an
increasingly serious global economic slowdown.
The export decline was especially embarrassing for President George Bush,
who depicted exports as a route to economic salvation in his Thursday night
debate with presidential contenders, Mr Bill Clinton and Mr Ross Perot.
'The thing that has saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our
exports, and what I am trying to do is increase our exports,' Mr Bush said.
In financial markets, bond prices fell, partly on rumours that Mr Clinton is
planning an immediate fiscal stimulus if elected on November 3.
Some analysts fear that a short-term fiscal stimulus would put upward
pressure on long-bond yields, even if balanced by fresh proposals for budget
retrenchment in the medium-term.
The Dollars 9bn trade deficit was far higher than expected by analysts. The
main cause was a broadly-based decline in exports, which fell Dollars 2.3bn
to Dollars 35.5bn.
This was only partially offset by a Dollars 0.6bn fall in imports to Dollars
44.5bn, reflecting weak US consumer demand.
The trade deficit for the first eight months of the year was Dollars 51.9bn,
more than 20 per cent higher than in the same period last year, despite a
sluggish domestic economy.
The Federal Reserve said industrial production fell 0.2 per cent last month,
following a 0.4 per cent decline in August.
The declines were broadly-based, with significant falls in defence and space
equipment, construction supplies and durable materials.
Manufacturing output fell 0.4 per cent with durable goods production down
0.7 per cent.
Capacity utilisation in manufacturing fell to 77.2 per cent, a full
percentage point drop since May.
The production figures were the weakest since last winter when the economy
was experiencing a second economic dip.
While not necessarily implying a contraction of the whole economy, they
indicate the sluggish growth of the summer months is petering out.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Clinton files row move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTING US Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger yesterday took
responsibility for the controversial bid to find old passport files of
Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton, Reuter reports. Apparently
stung by claims that low-level officials were being blamed, Mr Eagleburger
said: 'The buck stops here.'
He said he was prepared to testify publicly on the matter before Congress.
The Senate foreign relations committee scheduled but then postponed a Monday
public hearing on charges that the State Department used improper procedures
to try to get files about Mr Clinton.
The controversy involves the recent search for files in Washington, London
and Oslo at a time when President Bush's supporters were increasing attacks
on Mr Clinton's draft record, his role in the anti-war movement as a student
and a trip he made to Moscow.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Noises on and noises off: Jurek Martin reflects from the
serenity of Sanibel, deep down Florida's Gulf coast, on this week's ructions
in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON is the best of towns and it is the worst of towns. No town
contains a greater distillation of political sophistication and no town can
be as divorced from political reality. This week demonstrated the ultimate
contrast.
All the noises in Washington are of men at war and jumping ship. If, as is
still more likely than not, the effective administration of President George
Bush has only 2 1/2 more weeks to run, its final days are not exactly filled
with sweetness and light.
But, here in the hinterland, if the questions posed by Joe and Mary Public
to Messrs Bush, Clinton and Perot in Richmond, Virginia, on Thursday are any
guide, these noises might as well be on Mars. That does not make them less
sonorous, or less important, but it does put them into perspective.
The Washington ear is tuned into the fascinating fact that the Justice
Department is investigating the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is in
turn investigating the Justice Department, of which the FBI is
institutionally a part. The Central Intelligence Agency is also trading
allegations with the Justice Department. All the fusillades have their
origins in the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) affair.
Similarly, Budget Director Richard Darman has done his best to blame
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of the
council of economic advisers, for making a mess of the president's tax
policies, They have been a bit too polite to respond, but all has been
revealed in exquisite detail by Bob Woodward in the Washington Post.
Over at the State Department, now free of the hegemony of Mr James Baker,
who is occupied with running President Bush's re-election campaign,
officials are speaking with delicious indiscretion over the circumstances of
the departmental investigation of presidential challenger Bill Clinton's
private life. That the investigation should have been overseen by an
unpopular political appointee named to her post at the behest of Mr John
Sununu, the former White House chief of staff whom all Washington loves to
hate now that he is out, is merely an explanation.
Nobody, it seems, had the will to restore order. Not Mr Baker, whose
long-awaited speech - either on the economy or on why he thinks Mr Bush
should be re-elected - remained undelivered.
Not Mr William Sessions, director of the FBI, now under fire for having
dodged taxes, billing the government for private phone calls and other
hanging offences.
Not CIA chief Robert Gates, who is in Russia, presumably looking for
evidence that the KGB planted a transmitter in Mr Clinton's lower lip 23
years ago in Moscow.
Nor - apart from Arabs buying US, not British, tanks as if they were going
out of style - was there much evidence of foreigners jumping on board Mr
Bush's ship. Most German chancellors, including socialists, endorse
Republican presidents but, consumed by Eurodramas and a few local
difficulties, Helmut Kohl has said not a word.
Nor has British Prime Minister John Major displayed any public gratitude for
the wholescale lifting by the Republicans of last spring's Tory campaign.
Even the Japanese, who tend to respond automatically to requests from the
White House, have been quiet, privately concentrating on working out what Mr
Clinton's trade policies really are. French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas
stands alone in his endorsement, and that was delivered months ago.
The curious thing is that, throughout all this, Mr Bush has remained almost
serene. He has a pit bull terrier for vice-president and assorted
rottweilers called Matalin, Fitzwater and Dornan, but the president himself
often seems as passive as his family dog, Millie.
Mr Bush does get rattled occasionally and still misspeaks himself but,
mostly, he stands on the dignity of being president. He applauded Mr Quayle
for the savagery of his debate onslaught this week, but having been set up
by Mr Quayle for the Thursday round, he barely raised his voice.
Though Mr Quayle would have taken any opportunity to impugn Mr Clinton, Mr
Bush did not. He answered the questions put to him, less well than Mr
Clinton and less entertainingly than Mr Perot, but he answered them.
Only once in 90 minutes were there even allusions to Vietnam, Moscow, trust,
character or all the other things that Washington thinks he must make stick
in order to retain the presidency. On the other side, yet again the names of
Iran and Iraq, let alone a certain subsidiary of an Italian bank, never
crossed a questioner's lips.
The Washington conclusion is there is no iron in Mr Bush's soul. The country
may well also be about to vote him out, but not because he lacks iron or any
other vitamin that might transform him into the Man Who Eats Democrats For
Breakfast. It is because he has run out of ideas on the real problems of
real people. He ought to be here; at least the tide comes in and out.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Rate cut fails to calm coal storm: Major faces toughest
crisis as Tory MPs threaten Commons revolt over pit closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was strug-gling last night to weather the most severe crisis
of his premiership after a 1 percentage point cut in interest rates to 8 per
cent failed to calm the storm of protest against British Coal's drastic pit
closure plan.
With Conservative MPs threatening defeat for the government on the closures
when the House of Commons returns next week, the prime minister offered a
second olive branch to his critics by promising training for the 31,000
miners facing unemployment.
The training measures, which will be detailed in the Commons on Monday by Mr
Michael Hesel-tine, trade and industry secretary, will be channelled through
employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils.
Mr Major acknowledged also the growing concern among industrialists that the
economic recession now threatens to turn into a slump. He promised an
intensive dialogue between Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and business
leaders to explore how the government could help industry to take advantage
of the competitive edge provided by the devaluation of the pound.
In a stark warning of the task the government faces to head off a revolt in
Wednesday's coal debate, Sir Marcus Fox, a barometer of backbench opinion in
his role as chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, had earlier
said the plan's scale was 'unacceptable' and had 'incensed' colleagues.
With their anxieties over the economy only partly relieved by the rate cut,
the number of Tory MPs publicly questioning the coal proposals easily
exceeds the 11 needed to overturn the government's Commons majority of 21 -
and some rebels were predicting victory.
A Yorkshire Post survey last night found 44 out of the 72 Tory MPs who
responded said they did not support the government's handling of the pit
closures.
Speaking at the end of the European Community summit in Birmingham, Mr Major
insisted that there could be no going back on the decision to close 31 of
British Coal's 50 pits.
He acknowledged the 'an-guish' which had been caused by the scale and speed
of the programme. But insisting there was no prospect of finding a market
for the stockpiles of coal building up at pitheads and generating stations,
he added: 'The fact was that we simply could not ignore reality.' Financing
the surplus production was costing the government Pounds 100m a month.
He said the announcement had come after a detailed analysis of both the UK's
strategic energy needs and of whether some of the 'marginal pits' could
survive.
Mr Heseltine will face the 1922 committee before Wednesday's debate in what
could be a stormy confrontation.
Labour plans to introduce a motion to attract maximum Tory support. 'We will
be doing everything possible for those Tory MPs who believe that the
government has got it wrong to record that view on Wednesday,' said Mr Robin
Cook, the party's trade and industry spokesman.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats have launched national campaigns to save
pits. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, said the prime minister had ordered 'a
panic interest rate cut and a panic announcement of extra assistance for
sacked miners'.
The crisis of confidence over the handling of the decision to shut 31 of
British Coal's 50 pits ahead of privatisation overshadowed the EC summit.
Downing Street added to the confusion by issuing a third version of which
cabinet members had been told in advance of the closures announcement.
Betraying the apparent haste with which the plans were drawn up and agreed,
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by British
Coal's decision to close the Point of Ayr pit in Wales. He has asked for
clarification and further information from the company.
Mr Major said the interest rate cut was fully justified in terms of the
government's commitment to bring down inflation. But his emphasis on his
concern to help 'families and industry' was an acknowledgement of the damage
done by the closures announcement.
Despite the Treasury's justification of the rate cut, there was suspicion
that its timing had been dictated by the mounting political crisis.
Tory backbenchers publicly welcomed the move but it failed to stop private
anxieties of many over the lack of a clear economic strategy since the UK's
withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  17 OCT 92 / RHM plans split to fight bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RANKS Hovis McDougall, the UK milling, baking and grocery products group
facing a Pounds 780m cash bid from Hanson, the Anglo-US industrial
conglomerate, yesterday announced plans to split into three companies.
Mr Stanley Metcalfe, RHM chairman, said the demerger plan was 'the most
effective way of delivering the value that is within the group to RHM
shareholders' and would give them an alternative to the Hanson offer.
RHM shareholders would receive shares in each of three companies:
A milling and baking group, including bread brands such as Hovis and
Mother's Pride, as well as Federal Bakeries, which RHM bought yesterday from
Dalgety, the food group, for Pounds 28m.
A grocery products company, including Bisto gravy mixes, Robertson's jams,
Keiller and Golden Shred marmalade.
A cake manufacturer, including the Mr Kipling brand.
Mr Metcalfe said that rather than Hanson selling parts of the business for
more than it had paid for the group, RHM's own shareholders should benefit.
He acknowledged that the demerged businesses could be taken over.
RHM's board had been concerned for months about the fall in its share price,
which reached a low of 135p in mid-September, Mr Metcalfe said. Various
options had been considered to address the fall before Hanson bid.
'Whilst it may be true that Lord Hanson (Hanson's chairman) has provided a
stimulus for these proposals, I would not wish to dent his modesty by
overstating that point,' he said.
Lord Hanson responded by saying: 'Modesty undented, I continue to believe
that our cash offer fully values RHM.'
Mr Metcalfe said the demerger would reward shareholders for their loyalty on
previous bid occasions. The group turned down an offer of 465p a share in
1988. Lord Hanson countered that 'since 1988 this loyalty has cost
shareholders half the value of their investment'.
It echoes the step taken by Imperial Chemical Industries in July when it
said it would split into two companies. Hanson had taken a small stake in
ICI last year and although it did not bid, ICI was put under pressure to
improve its performance.
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, demerged its
retailing and paper-making subsidiaries after Sir James Goldsmith threatened
an 'unbundling' bid in 1989.
Lord Hanson said the stock market's reaction to RHM's announcement 'bears
out our view that there is no added value in these proposals'. RHM shares
rose 5p to 246p, 26p above Hanson's cash offer.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Mixed reception given to one-point reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT acted yesterday to head off a further slide in economic and
political confidence by announcing a 1 percentage point cut in interest
rates.
The reduction to 8 per cent is likely to lead to lower home loans for most
of Britain's 10m mortgage holders and was generally applauded in industry,
although many executives said more reductions were needed to get the economy
moving.
On financial markets, the announcement prompted a grudging reception, on the
grounds that the move smacked of a hasty response by the government to
political pressures caused by mounting job losses and general economic
gloom.
The move to Britain's lowest base rates since mid-1988 was signalled at
around noon when the Bank of England cut the rates at which it lends to the
banking system. This was followed quickly by commercial banks reducing their
base lending rates from 9 per cent to 8 per cent.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the decision to cut rates was 'fully
consistent' with the objective of lower inflation. He said all the recent
evidence in the UK and other countries was that 'disinflationary forces
remain strong and confidence weak'. He added: 'Provided cost and price
inflation are kept firmly under control, British industry can look forward
with confidence to a pick-up in domestic and overseas sales.'
Three of the biggest mortgage lenders - Abbey National, National &amp;
Provincial and Northern Rock - announced cuts in mortgage rates of up to
3/4 point to 9.25 per cent. Other lenders are expected to follow soon,
although few are likely to pass on the full 1-point cut.
The timing of the announcement - three days after the Bank had signalled
that imminent interest rate cuts were unlikely - unsettled some investors.
Reflecting this, the pound was initially marked down by 2 pfennigs to a low
of DM2.438. It recovered slightly, closing in London at DM2.4475 for a loss
of 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day. Against the dollar, the pound lost more than 4
cents, closing at Dollars 1.6570.
In New York sterling was quoted at DM2.4400 and Dollars 1.6485 at the close.
On the London stock market, shares initially gained but fell back later,
with the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closing up 17.3, at 2,563.9,
after at one point being 41 points ahead. Gilts closed up to a point higher.

FT  17 OCT 92 / European leaders pledge to make EC more open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BIRMINGHAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders last night agreed to give a new look to the EC,
pledging to make it more open and democratic to recapture the confidence of
ordinary European citizens.
The blueprint was portrayed as vital to win popular and parliamentary
support in the UK and Denmark for ratification of the Maastricht treaty and
bolster the Community image as a vehicle for economic recovery.
But the one-day summit in Birmingham called by Mr John Major to address last
month's convulsions in the money markets was overshadowed by Britain's
increasingly serious political crisis and signs of divisions between France
and her EC partners over prospects for a deal in the world trade
liberalisation talks.
Mr Major, chairing the meeting, was pushed on the defensive after the UK's 1
percentage point cut in interest rates. The surprise move caused some
European officials to predict that it would hasten the development of a
'two-tier' Europe and make it more difficult for sterling to rejoin the
exchange rate mechanism.
But the summit declaration ruled out the prospect of an 'inner-core' of
stronger EC economies and more federally minded countries moving at a faster
pace to political and monetary union.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said everybody wanted to ratify Maastricht
and put it into action without changes.
Mr Major said it was confidence that we needed to restore' after the
'body-blow' delivered by the uncertainty over Maastricht and money markets
turmoil. A world trade agreement which would add 'an extra Dollars 200bn in
wealth every 10 years' was needed to boost confidence.
Mr Major said recent EC-US talks aimed at concluding the Uruguay Round of
trade talks had made 'far more progress than for a long time indeed'. But a
senior French official said: 'The gap is not as narrow as they would like
you to think.'
The bulk of yesterday's summit was devoted to reforming the way the
Community does business and selling the EC to European citizens.
In a self-critical draft declaration, the Twelve pledged to make the
Community more open, to respect national culture and traditions, to keep the
public better informed, and to make clear that 'citizenship of the Union'
brings 'our citizens additional rights and protections without in any way
taking the place of their national citizenship.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES MURRAY, the dissident shareholder who holds a 29.2 per cent stake
in Andrews Sykes, the specialist industrial services group, yesterday lost
his battle to unseat Mr David Hubbard, chairman, and take control of the
board.
Shareholders, led by institutional investors, representing more than 62 per
cent of the ordinary shares, voted, and issued proxies, in support of Mr
Hubbard and the existing board at an extraordinary meeting called at the
request of Mr Murray.
The vote ends a bitter six-week battle for boardroom control between Mr
Murray, who is also chairman and majority shareholder of Nu-Swift, the fire
protection, office cleaning and property company, and the Andrews Sykes
board led by Mr Hubbard who became non-executive chairman last autumn.
Mr Murray had asked shareholders to back six resolutions at the
extraordinary meeting which would have removed Mr Hubbard and Mr David
Crowe, one of the two other non-executive directors, from the five-man
board, and replace them with himself and three of his associates. All of the
resolutions were rejected by a substantial majority.
European Fire Protection, one of Mr Murray's investment vehicles, issued a
statement saying it was disappointed with the outcome but added that it felt
justified in 'focusing shareholders' attention on Andrews Sykes' poor
financial performance and the failure of management to address the decline
in profitability with an effective strategy.'

commercial campus, will be inaugurated today.
Northumberland Tec has bought Longhirst, a listed mansion in 45 acres of
parkland near Morpeth, for management training and business education.
Tecs deliver government-funded training schemes in England and Wales,
Longhirst Hall, built in 1824, is to be refurbished and run from September
next year by the Tec as a management training and conference centre.
The Northumberland Tec will also build a business college for the expanding
University of Northumbria at Newcastle, formerly Newcastle Polytechnic.
The college, opening in stages from September, will offer degree, diploma
and certificate courses in business studies, management, marketing and
accountancy for 600 full-time and part-time students, with a target of 1,000
by 2000.
Proposed developments include a block of 75 bedrooms for the management
training centre, housing for 200 university students and a business
innovation centre with start-up units.
The Tec's budget this year is Pounds 17.5m, of which Pounds 15.5m is from
government sources. It is putting around Pounds 2m of its operating surplus
into the project and has also arranged bank loans. Longhirst was bought for
just under Pounds 1m.
To meet its Pounds 10m target, it is looking for private finance and
European funding and is negotiating for venture capital.

THE AREA of countryside lost every year to urban sprawl may be twice as
great as government figures suggest, according to a report by the Council
for the Protection of Rural England, the rural pressure group.
In the first survey of land-use since the second world war, the CPRE claims
that 'an area the size of Exeter, Norwich and Oxford' could be urbanised
each year.
The survey argues that farmers have consistently under-reported the area of
land which is no longer used for farming.
It claims that 'an area the size of Greater London has been 'lost' from
official figures'.
Using new data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
together with environmental surveys, the CPRE suggests that the current rate
of urbanisation could be as much as 11,000 hectares a year.
The government's figures are nearer 5,000 hectares a year.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Franco pledge on Brazilian reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S acting president Itamar Franco said yesterday his government
remained committed to the 'basic principles' of the modernisation programme
started by President Fernando Collor, who was suspended last month on
corruption charges.
In a message to the Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in Great Britain,
yesterday celebrating its 50th anniversary, Mr Franco underlined his support
for 'the full normalisation of our relations with the international
financial community, the uninterrupted implementation of the privatisation
programme and the opening up of the Brazilian economy.'
He said Brazil would always welcome foreign capital wishing to share the
risks of the market economy and the challenges of development.
In a speech to the chamber, Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the UK Board
of Trade, urged the Brazilian government to move quickly with the
implementation of adequate intellectual property legislation and to continue
to reduce tariffs, which currently average 20 per cent. He also stressed the
importance of Brazil's fiscal reform efforts.
He welcomed recent moves by the Brazilian government to improve the climate
for foreign investment, and said he looked forward to the removal next year
of constitutional limitations on foreign investment in mining and oil and
gas exploration, production and refining.
He said British companies, which already had about Pounds 1.5bn of
investments in Brazil, were particularly interested in developing trade in
several sectors: the construction of the gas pipeline between Bolivia and
Sao Paulo; cellular telephones and fibre optics; ports and airports; oil and
gas production; water treatment and consumer products.

FT  16 OCT 92 / French threat to farm reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE has no intention of complying with agreed reforms to the Common
Agriculture Policy (CAP), senior European Commission officials said in
Brussels yesterday.
Since France is Europe's main farming superpower, and its leading farm
exporter, this may put in jeopardy principal aims of the reform, including
substantial cuts to the farm subsidy regime that is hobbling the EC budget.
It would also explain France's increasingly fierce opposition to a
compromise settlement on the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
liberalisation, raising fresh doubts about whether a deal can be reached.
Optimism among Community negotiators that they are able to conclude a deal
with the US is underpinned by an assumption that the CAP reforms agreed in
May will deliver the farm subsidy cuts demanded by the US and other farm
exporters.
Hopes have risen this week that a breakthrough is imminent in the
long-stalled Uruguay Round negotiations, following US-EC talks in Brussels
early this week, which reached tentative agreement on two of three
unresolved disputes over subsidised farm trade.
Negotiators failed to settle the last outstanding issue, on the EC's oilseed
subsidy regime, because the US could not be convinced that proposed CAP
reforms would deliver the cuts that EC officials say would follow.
During talks aimed at persuading intransigent French officials that a Gatt
deal can be agreed without adding to reforms already worked out under the
CAP reform, senior European Commission officials have told the French that
even if the EC accepts the full 24 per cent cut in subsidised cereals
exports the US wants, the Community will still be able to export 23.5m
tonnes in six years' time.
This would be more than the 19m tonnes of exports projected under the reform
of the CAP.
But French officials told them they do not believe the CAP reform will work
or be adhered to. 'It is clear now that France never really intended to
comply with CAP reform,' one senior Commission official declared yesterday.
If Washington now concludes that France, the US's main competitor, thinks
the CAP reform which underpins the Gatt negotiations is not to be taken
seriously, their last-ditch efforts to obtain a deal may evaporate. The
danger of a trade war between the US and the EC would then be grave, with
the entire international trading system likely to be affected.
The French position ignores inconvenient facts, EC officials say:
it is the US, which originally wanted 90 per cent cuts on export subsidies
and 75 per cent cuts on internal support, that has moved towards the EC
negotiating position, which most Community officials see as strengthened by
President Bush's electoral plight.
Quite apart from France's commitments under CAP reform, President
Mitterrand, UK prime minister John Major and Mr Delors all agreed at July's
Munich summit of the Group of Seven on a 21 per cent cut in subsidised food
exports, according to member-state and Commission officials.
The 24 per cent cut sought by Gatt and the US was originally put forward by
Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister and then EC president, at a meeting in
The Hague last November with Mr Bush.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has praised Brazil for its
sweeping trade liberalisation programme, implemented despite serious
economic difficulties in just two years.
In a report yesterday the Gatt secretariat says the reforms have achieved
impressive results in changing Brazil's tradition of inward-looking
policies.
However, Gatt warns that liberalisation efforts could be put at risk by
failure to tackle rampant inflation and achieve sustained economic growth.
Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's Gatt ambassador, assured Gatt's governing council
during discussion of the report that the new government of President Itamar
Franco was committed to liberalisation. He said economic reforms commanded a
growing consensus within Brazilian society.
Mr Amorim said Brazil's former policy of import substitution and state
intervention, under which it had built up its diversified industrial base to
become the world's tenth biggest economy, had not failed but had reached its
limits.
Trade liberalisation has been a key element in Brazil's structural
adjustment programme adopted by the incoming democratic government in March
1990 to stabilise the economy and boost industrial efficiency and
competitiveness.
Since 1990 the Brazilian government has scrapped almost all import
restrictions, streamlined trade procedures and slashed tariffs. Remaining
restrictions in the informatics sector are due to end this month and by
mid-1993 tariffs will average just over 14 per cent against 41 per cent in
1989.
However, the Gatt secretariat says price and exchange rate stability, and
sustained economic growth, are 'a necessary condition' for consolidation of
the reforms. 'Failure to control inflation, to revive economic activity, and
to tackle rising unemployment, would increase the political odds against the
success of the liberalisation experiment.'
The report adds that Brazil's membership of the Southern Cone Common Market
(Mercosur) cannot provide a substitute for a successful conclusion to the
Uruguay Round of global trade talks, which would improve Brazil's access to
markets in industrial nations for its exports.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fall in volume cuts UDO 37%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTON MORAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UDO HOLDINGS, which supplies drawing office equipment and reprographic
services, saw year-end pre-tax profit fall 37 per cent in recessionary
trading conditions from Pounds 9.03m to Pounds 5.71m, writes Walton Morais.
Turnover fell from Pounds 55.84m to Pounds 51.71m in the year to July 31.
Despite measures taken to modify the operational structure, no amount of
savings in overheads could offset the profit lost by the volume fall.
The company made provisions of Pounds 300,000 for further rationalisation
and reorganisation costs, which pushed total exceptional charges to Pounds
517,000 (Pounds 213,000).
Although earnings per share fell to 13.66p (20.78p), the company is
recommending a final dividend of 4.76p for a 17 per cent increase in the
total payment to 6.70p. The company cited a strong balance sheet to justify
the increased payment. Cash balance at year-end stood at Pounds 13.3m,
making up 46 per cent of net assets. The dividend cover stood at 2 times,
down from about 3.5 times.
The slight decline in the cash balance, from Pounds 13.4m, was largely due
to Pounds 2.9m cash spent on four longer-term strategic acquisitions to
increase geograpical coverage or extend services provided. This also led to
a 22 per cent fall in interest income to Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 1.75m).
Mike Wright, chairman, said the strong balance sheet was achieved through
close attention being paid to cash generation and the monitoring of working
capital.
Mr Wright forecast another tough year ahead for the group because there was
no forseeable improvement in trading conditions.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BNB RESOURCES, the recruitment, training and advertising group, suffered a
sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.26m to just Pounds 53,000 in the
first half of 1992.
The human resources side lifted its profits from Pounds 828,000 to Pounds
1.37m in the face of 'intense downward pressure' in UK recruitment markets,
said Mr David Norman, chairman. But property costs climbed to Pounds 827,000
(Pounds 341,000) because of a rent review in December 1991 and also because
the company had about 40 per cent of its building vacant for a time. This
space is now refurbished and used by ATC.
ATC, the chartered accountancy training company acquired at the end of 1991
for a total Pounds 5.25m, was the other main cause of the group downturn. Mr
Norman said that, although modest profits had been expected in ATC's first
year, revenues had declined by about 15 per cent because fewer students were
enrolling in the first half and more in the second. He expected the training
division would break even over the full year.
NB Selection's revenues grew 45 per cent and profits were doubled. Mr Norman
said the group was lifting market share in recruitment, often at the expense
of financially weaker competitors. Norman Broadbent International lifted
revenues by 16 per cent in the UK, 79 per cent in Hong Kong and 51 per cent
in the US.
The group had cash balances of Pounds 3m. Earnings fell to 0.1p (3.9p) per
share, leaving the interim dividend, maintained at 1.6p, uncovered.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Management: Consistency pays best dividends - Roger Young of
the British Institute of Management suggests a new approach to top
executives' salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate on top people's salaries in Britain has reached such a pitch this
year that there is an outcry every time a company reveals a sharp rise in
the salary of its chairman or chief executive.
At present, discussion is focusing on the disparity between the basic salary
or performance bonuses of several high flyers and their company's short-term
performance.
Instead of each rise being condemned out of hand, the debate should now
broaden to include how total remuneration for all managers should be
defined, established, maintained and controlled. The goal should be the use
of professional processes which are transparent and systematic, right
through companies - including the top.
However irresponsible the ballooning salaries of some high flyers, we must
not get carried away. Such people, although very visible and with large,
well-known enterprises at their command, are relatively few in number.
A recent British Institute of Management survey of both managers' and
directors' salaries, showed that the increases received by the directors of
small- and medium-sized organisations were far more restrained than those of
directors of large companies with substantial turnovers.
In fact, the percentage increases of the more lowly-paid directors were
below those of employees generally. They led by example as they flew over
the choppy economic waters in which their corporate rivals were sinking. In
some cases their reductions in remuneration were the surplus ballast ditched
to keep the company afloat.
So what is remuneration, as opposed just to salaries? Pro Ned, the
organisation which promotes the role of non-executive directors, defines the
elements of the remuneration package as: basic salary, a performance-related
element, profit-sharing schemes, share options and other benefits.
Pension entitlements and the wording of any service contract are the
'off-balance sheet' equivalents that I believe should be included. Too
often, these are the more costly elements that only come to light, if at
all, when the remuneration incentive package fails to achieve the expected
results and the chief executive leaves amicably to pursue other interests.
How should top executives' remuneration be established? The answer is
simple. By the same process and with the same care as any other salary in
the same company.
If this principle were applied throughout Britain, two significant changes
would occur. First, if the same high level of detailed consideration were
given to the pay and conditions of the workforce as is currently applied to
top executives' financial rewards, personnel practices would improve
significantly in many companies.
Second, throughout the workforce, a far greater level of satisfaction and
improved output would be achieved.
Employees would understand the process of evaluation, be correctly
counselled, appraised and take a greater interest in the progress of the
company. If good management practices are used, there should be little
difference in the application of the standard corporate principles to the
principals.
There are many well-established and widely-used systems offering help in
evaluating the breadth and depth of a position. Extending their principles
to directors' remuneration should prove no problem to those familiar with
their use.
The beauty of such systems is that they establish a framework. If those at
the top are included within the same framework as those under their control,
it means that all are tied to the same industry conditions and constraints
in times of austerity. Where current debate has been unhelpful is in the
assumption that directors are an industry group unto themselves and,
therefore, need to be compared across the piste.
What is different at the very top of the management hierarchy is the need
for referees. In the parlance of academia, there is a requirement for
accreditors and verifiers to maintain, respectively, the application of
standards and also their continuing credibility.
So who should take on the mantle of accrediting the application of the
remuneration process? Quite clearly, in the case of the chief executive's
salary and that of any other executive on the main board, a remuneration
committee of independent directors is the appropriate body  - providing, of
course, that the members are truly independent.
Pro Ned not only produces guides and guidance but also offers a service to
companies both public and private to find independent non-executive director
candidates.
A candidate chosen from a Pro Ned assembled list, matching criteria selected
by the company, should assuage any criticism of back-scratching from
suspicious shareholders or others.
And who fulfils the role of verifying the continued credibility of the
remuneration process? On this, we have yet to see the final deliberations of
the Cadbury Committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. My
suggestion is that the first cautious step in this direction might be taken
by the stock exchange.
If, to one of their many listing requirements, was added: 'that a statement
on the basis for establishing the remuneration of the executive members of
the board be included in the annual report and accounts', then shareholders
at the annual general meeting would be entitled to ask questions on the
subject without being ruled out of order by an obstructive chairman.
To suggest that a similar statement should be incorporated in the Companies
Act before first piloting the idea might be precipitate.
If institutional shareholders backed the Stock Exchange route and offered
advice on the amount of detail and how far companies needed to travel to
comply, then this initiative might save the need for politically-inspired
legislation.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Management: Cultural differences break down in the boardroom
 -Growing pressure for change in the way companies are run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany employs an elaborate system of checks and balances. France has an
almost Napoleonic concentration of power. And the British prefer a
pragmatic, middling path.
In the field of corporate governance - how companies are governed - as in so
many other areas of political and economic life, there remain big cultural
divisions between the world's leading industrial economies.
However, the differences should narrow significantly over the coming decade,
according to a new study* of corporate governance in the seven leading
western industrial nations prepared by Oxford Analytica, the British
consultancy.
The single most important reason, it argues, is the increasing globalisation
of business activity, which is 'profoundly changing the nature of corporate
management and organisation throughout all industrial economies and which
will exert a decisive influence on systems of corporate governance over the
next 10 years'.
International competition is becoming more intense and cross-border
takeovers are on the rise. But above all, says the report, international
investors are growing in number and clout, and companies that want to
attract capital will have to ensure that their interests in stronger
corporate governance are met. The study, sponsored by recruitment firm,
Russell Reynolds, accountants Price Waterhouse, investment bank Goldman
Sachs, and lawyers Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, is said to be the first of its
kind.
David Young, the managing director of Oxford Analytica, notes that pension
fund money invested outside domestic markets is forecast to grow from
Dollars 92bn (Pounds 53.4bn) in 1985 to Dollars 780bn in 1995.
Market forces such as these, says the report, are likely to reinforce a
trend, already occuring through European Community policy, for continental
European corporate governance practices to move towards the framework common
in Britain, the US and Canada.
Institutional investors in the three English-speaking countries - and the US
in particular - have been most active in trying to make managements more
responsive to shareholders' interests, demanding more outside representation
on boards of directors, a better flow of information to investors and
greater executive accountability for company policies and strategy.
That contrasts sharply with France and Italy, where boards have
traditionally been supine in the face of executive power. And in Japan the
board is, for all practical purposes, an extension of management with no
independent powers, and shareholders are totally passive.
However, the report argues that Germany 'is arguably the only one of the
seven countries . . . in which the system of corporate governance does
indeed result in effective oversight of management by the representatives of
other stakeholders'.
This is because of its two-tier board structure, which involves a
supervisory board, representing shareholder and employee interests, which in
turn appoints an executive board of managers.
The report suggests that the German system could provide a useful model for
companies in other countries which want to create new channels for corporate
governance, alongside an existing boardroom structure.
However, the German system is often criticised for the powerful role played
on supervisory boards by the nation's banks, both as shareholders in their
own right and as proxies able to vote shares deposited with them, which can
create strong conflicts of interest.
The survey suggests this power may be reduced somewhat over the decade, due
to a desire among banks to cut their holdings, the growth of institutional
shareholding and industry's reduced reliance on banks for capital.
At the same time, German companies will face legal and regulatory changes to
improve accounting standards, ban insider trading and dismantle restrictive
voting structures. The cumulative effect will be to weaken the power of the
boards and increase the influence of institutional investors.
In France, where until now the president or directeur-general of a company
has had almost unlimited authority, boards will become more active, due to
international competition for capital, a move by French pension funds into
equities, and increasing pressure from shareholders and regulatory
authorities for greater transparency. The same trends are likely in Italy,
though to a lesser extent, given the unusually large number of Italian
companies owned by a single family.
Even Japan is expected to move a tiny bit towards a western-style system of
corporate governance, prodded by factors such as a fledgling movement to
strengthen shareholder rights and a need to include foreign directors in
decision-making. However, there is a danger of exaggerating the impact of
all these forces of convergence. International institutional investors, who
are supposed to be the main engine of change, are still pretty passive, even
in the US, when dealing with companies beyond their borders.
The report suggests they will demand greater access to information (which
seems certain) and greater participation in decision-making (which is
questionable in the medium-term) but are unlikely to engage in the kind of
share-holder-versus-management voting battles which have become common in
the US. The 1990s will thus be an era of 'noticeable changes in corporate
governance, but not revolution'.

More bad news for Trafalgar House. The Ritz, earmarked for disposal, now
faces a Pounds 3m claim for personal liability damages after losing a
long-running court battle involving a guest's 45ft plunge from the hotel's
terrace. The House of Lords has found the hotel to be at fault in not having
a high enough balustrade.
The case hinged on whether the Ritz had raised the floor of the terrace, as
the unfortunate guest, who sustained a fractured skull, asserted. To prove
the point, his solicitor had examined old lithographs at the British Museum
to establish that an extra step up to the terrace had appeared; won a court
order to dig up the terrace; examined the tiles; tracked them down to the
factory in Germany where they were made; and obtained a statement from the
man who made them in 1976.

THE WEAKNESS of the US paper and pulp market was underscored yesterday when
two companies - Georgia-Pacific and Bowater Inc - both reported continuing
losses in the third quarter.
Georgia-Pacific reported a net loss of Dollars 37m, or 43 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of Dollars 31m, or 36 cents a share, in the same
period of last year.
The 1991 figures included a Dollars 12m after-tax loss from asset sales.
Net sales increased from Dollars 2.97bn last year to Dollars 3.06bn.
The company's building products business produced record profits of Dollars
201m, up from Dollars 129m, while pulp and paper dipped from Dollars 67m to
Dollars 23m.
Mr T. Marshall Hahn, chairman, said pulp and paper profits were negatively
affected by weak market conditions and downtime taken to reduce inventory
and reform maintenance.
Market pulp prices improved in the third quarter and despite relatively high
industry inventory, its containerboard and packaging business remained good.
Bowater, the newsprint manufacturer, reported a third-quarter net loss of
Dollars 17.9m, or 51 cents, on sales of Dollars 366.2m. This compared with
income of Dollars 7.1m, or 17 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 312m in the
same period of last year.
The 1992 results are not directly comparable because of an acquisition.
Mr AP Gammie, chairman, said he believed the company was 'past the worst'.
Newsprint prices had firmed, and while the company was still some way from
profitability in this area, it was heading in the right direction.

DU PONT Japan, the Japanese arm of the US chemical maker, and Mitsui, the
Japanese trading house, yesterday announced plans to establish a joint
venture company to increase both partners' penetration of Asian-Pacific
markets.
The new company, to be formed next month, will attempt to match Du Pont's
product development skills with Mitsui's extensive regional branch network,
as well as considering new product areas for both companies.
Mitsui said the agreement followed an approach by Du Pont. It is a sign of
Japanese companies' willingness to form strategic partnerships with foreign
producers to take advantage of growing demand in Asian markets.
The trading house has close ties to Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, the country's
third largest chemical manufacturer, and to Mitsui Petrochemical Industries,
which are both members of the Mitsui keiretsu, or family of companies.
Mitsui said the agreement with Du Pont would not compromise existing
partnerships that the two have with other companies, nor would it disrupt
their existing business networks in Asia. The new company, to be called Du
Pont MBK Alliance, is likely to have a capital of Y100m (Pounds 467,000).

CIMENTOS de Portugal (Cimpor), the state-owned Portuguese cement producer
facing privatisation, has lifted its holding in Corporacion Noroeste (CN), a
Spanish cement group, to 97.7 per cent.
The three-stage acquisition cost Esc40bn (Dollars 307m). Last month Cimpor
bought a 24.9 per cent stake. It later reached agreement for the purchase of
a further 25.7 per cent. Cimpor has also undertaken to buy 10.4 per cent of
Cementos Cosmos, another Spanish cement company, in which CN has a major

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Finnish banks deteriorate
sharply

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE FINNISH banks yesterday revealed a sharp deterioration in performance
for the first eight months, reflecting the severe Finnish recession, high
credit losses and narrow margins.
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP) disclosed a FM2.53bn (Dollars 546.43m) loss,
after credit losses jumped to FM2.4bn and profit from financial operations
fell 32 per cent to FM1.6bn. In the corresponding 1991 period it made a
FM318m loss.
The bank said write-offs for the full year would total FM3.6bn and its
overall loss would exceed FM3bn.
It also noted that non-performing loans totalled FM7.2bn at the end of
August, FM2.2bn more than at the start of the year and equivalent to 8 per
cent of total lending.
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chief executive, said: 'The financial difficulties
experienced by customers will continue to cause problems in the form of
non-performing loans and lending write-offs over the next few years.'
He warned that if losses continued at the current pace, the bank would need
to raise new capital early next year, possibly by tapping the FM20bn state
guarantee fund. The bank has already strengthened its capital this year
through a USDollars 200m subordinated note issue and a FM1.7bn injection
from the government.
Unitas, the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, disclosed a
FM1.5bn loss before extraordinary items for the eight months, against a
FM131m profit in the comparable period. It was hit by FM1.29bn in credit
losses, and a 25 per cent fall to FM1.18bn in net income from financing
operations. Non-performing loans totalled FM7.8bn at the end of August,
around 6 per cent of total lending.
Unitas expects a significant worsening in its performance in the final four
months, leading it to estimate a year-end loss of FM3bn. In particular, the
group expects to be hit by a further FM1.7bn in credit losses, of which
FM800 relates to the Pomi group.
Mr Kurt Stenvall, chief executive of the Union Bank of Finland, said the
group would be prepared to resume talks to buy Skopbank from the government
guarantee fund, providing the terms were similar to those being discussed
last week. Skopbank was initially rescued by the Bank of Finland in
September 1991.
Skopbank announced a FM2.2bn loss for the period, compared with a FM475m
loss in the first eight months of 1991, after credit losses jumped to
FM1.5bn from FM344m. Consolidated income from financial operations fell to
FM68.9m from FM452.9m.
The bank is expecting a further FM1bn in losses in the final four months,
and has warned it will need additional financial support. It has already
received more than FM4bn in state support since being rescued.
Among the smaller banks, Okobank disclosed a FM1m profit for the first eight
months, down from FM199m in the same 1991 period. It warned it was likely to
make a loss over the whole year. STS Bank posted a FM281m operating loss,
reversing a FM44m profit in the comparable 1991 period.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Mercedes trebles purchases of British parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the German car manufacturer, says sterling is undervalued and
the British economy underrated. The company nearly trebled its purchases of
UK-produced motor components last year and expects them to grow further.
Two other German companies, BMW and the Volkswagen/Audi group - now
embracing SEAT of Spain and Skoda of Czechoslovakia - are also expanding
their purchasing of components made in the UK and say they, too, expect
further growth. All three say this growth would take place even without the
devaluation of sterling following its withdrawal from the European exchange
rate mechanism last month.
Any beneficial effects from the devaluation are, in any case, unlikely to
show up for several years because of the long lead times involved in
granting supplier contracts for new vehicles.
What amounts to a minor vote of confidence by the German vehicle industry in
the UK components sector comes during a week in which Lucas Industries, one
of the UK's biggest aerospace and motor components groups, has announced
4,000 job losses and sharply reduced profits. But in spite of poor UK car
sales and weakening continental car markets, Lucas profits from motor
components were virtually unchanged from 1990.
Mercedes-Benz raised its purchases of UK-produced components last year to
Pounds 72m from an annual average of around Pounds 25m. Purchases outside
the automotive sector by Mercedes' sister companies, AEG and Deutsche
Aerospace, lifted last year's total to about Pounds 310m.
This increase pre-dates sterling's devaluation against the D-Mark and is
thanks to significant quality and efficiency improvements by the UK
components industry, according to Mr Hans Tauscher, managing director of
Mercedes-Benz (UK).
'British industry is showing itself well able to deliver the goods at
competitive prices,' he said.
Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen have each set up a full-time purchasing office
in the UK. Volkswagen/Audi, Europe's biggest vehicle maker, also expects
increased component orders.
Mr Werner Svetlik, VW management board director with responsibility for
purchasing, has told UK component companies that they have the opportunity
to increase sharply the Pounds 86m-worth of parts they supplied to the
German company last year.
BMW, the most conservative of the German carmakers in terms of UK component
purchases, is increasing its spending, albeit from a very small base. From
DM25m in 1988 it is increasing to an expected DM95m (Pounds 39m) this year,
and is forecast to rise to DM120m next year. Lucas Industries is one of the
beneficiaries, having just won some of the engine fuel-injector business BMW
once reserved exclusively for Robert Bosch, the German engineering group.
Mercedes-Benz, like other German carmakers, acknowledges it is benefiting
from the UK industry's growing ties with Nissan, Toyota and Honda plants.
Meeting Japanese criteria for cost and quality is understood to have
increased UK competitiveness.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Canary Wharf sale may face 2-year delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY Wharf may not be sold to investors for two years, whether or not the
Jubilee Line extension to London's Docklands is built.
That was the warning given yesterday by Mr Stephen Adamson, a partner in
accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, who in May was appointed one of the joint
administrators of Canary Wharf under UK insolvency procedures.
However, no decision on whether to build the Pounds 1.6bn Underground line
extension was taken yesterday at a meeting of the government's special
Docklands committee under Lord Wakeham, leader of the House of Lords,
Some government departments argue fiercely that the project should go ahead,
although the Treasury still needs to be convinced that the extension should
be built. One government employee said that 'the odds on it being built' had
improved slightly.
Mr Adamson said: 'If the Jubilee Line is built, we could restructure the
project (involving the sale of all or part of it) within two years'.
If the government decides not to build the line, as officials say is likely,
Mr Adamson cannot say when a sale of the development will take place.
He also said that Canary Wharf's 11 commercial banks, who have lent Pounds
576m to the development, are unlikely to receive any repayments until 1998
unless an investor can be found to inject new funds.
'The banks would start to get repaid in 1998 from funds generated by letting
the estate,' Mr Adamson said. 'Repayments would continue till 2006.'
Whether or not the Jubilee Line extension is built, as soon as the
government makes a decision the administrators will move rapidly to
reorganise Canary Wharf's corporate structure.
A new company will be set up, with the administrators as its shareholders,
which would take control of assets and take on responsibility for letting
office space.
This would have the effect of giving confidence to potential tenants that
they are negotiating with a well-capitalised company. Banks would inject
funds into the new company to ensure that it has sufficient resources to
maintain services at Canary Wharf and provide incentives to attract
potential tenants.
If the Jubilee Line extension is built, the banks have agreed to provide
Pounds 30m of funds to meet these needs over the next three years.
The banks have offered Pounds 395m towards the Pounds 1.6bn Jubilee costs.
Mr Adamson said yesterday that, if the government decides that their offer
is unacceptable, he would like the opportunity to revise it.
The Treasury is unhappy that the first offered payment of Pounds 98m is
conditional on more than 2,000 Department of Environment civil servants
being moved to Canary Wharf. Mr Adamson recognises that the banks are
unlikely to remove this condition from their offer.
However, he wants to try to get some or all of the money from outside
investors: 'I would not be averse to going around with a begging bowl,' he
said. His colleague, Mr Nigel Hamilton, was pessimistic: 'It's a lot of
money,' he said.
Mr Adamson also disclosed that the administrators are in dispute with
Chemical Bank, the big American bank, about its right to cancel an agreement
to rent 225,000 square feet of space at Canary Wharf. Chemical Bank said
last month that it had decided to move its offices to Alban Gate in the City
rather than to Canary Wharf.
Mr Adamson said he hoped to come to an agreement with Chemical Bank for a
'lower amount'.

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Matif plans to start long
bond futures contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Marche a Terme International de France (Matif) yesterday announced plans
to launch a futures contract based on long-dated French government bonds,
maturing in 15 to 30 years.
The new contract, due for launch on January 28, is designed to complement
the exchange's 10-year bond future, which trades an average 120,000
contracts a day.
Turnover at the longer end of the market has grown dramatically as a result
of the French government's policy of extending its debt profile.
'About 35 per cent of supply from the French Treasury this year has
consisted of 30-year bonds,' said one trader, 'but most of the dealing is
between professional players'.
Four tap stocks (OATs) due 2008, 2012, 2019 and 2023, will be deliverable
under the contract. Outstandings in these lines total FF160bn.
Dealers said the French government bond market, widely believed to be the
most liquid in Europe as a result of the government's far-sighted structural
reforms in the 1980s, is deep enough to support two futures contracts.
However, they expect liquidity to be concentrated in the 10-year notional
bond future.
On its first day's trading, the new Euroswiss option on Liffe traded 425
contracts.
OTOB, the Austrian futures and options exchange, plans to launch an interest
rate futures contract in the second quarter of next year based on the
Austrian government's benchmark 10-year govern-ment bond.

Aegis, the media buying company which has recently gone through a number of
upheavals, has finally got a new finance director - Michel Lefebvre (left) -
six months after the previous incumbent, Charles Stern, left to join United
Newspapers.
The interregnum has witnessed some of Aegis's darkest hours - the enforced
departure of its chairman and chief executive, Peter Scott, a Pounds 20m
rights issue which failed to interest the City, and a share price which has
nosedived.
Lefebvre, 45, who will join Aegis's board, will take up his new post on
November 1. He holds degrees in civil engineering, and law and economics and
is something of a polyglot, speaking English and Italian besides his native
French.
Formerly finance director of two divisions of Groupe Valeo, the auto parts
manufacturer, Lefebvre has also done stints with Olivetti, Bendix and
CII-Honeywell Bull.
He joins Aegis at an interesting stage of its development. Aegis has just
relocated the majority of its managerial functions from London to Paris,
where he will be based. One of Lefebvre's main tasks will be to merge the
financial management and reporting of Aegis, the holding company, with those
of the operating companies in the Carat network throughout Europe.

GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence group, yesterday reported a sharp rise in
third-quarter net earnings, helped by higher profits in its tactical
military aircraft operations, reduced losses in space launch systems and
Dollars 23m of special one-time gains.
The company, which is undergoing a major restructuring, involving the sale
of non-core businesses, reported net earnings of Dollars 120m, up from
Dollars 71m in the same period of last year.
Earnings per share soared from Dollars 1.66 to Dollars 3.77. During the
quarter the company cut shares outstanding by 30 per cent due to a stock
repurchasing programme.
For the nine months, it reported net earnings of Dollars 641m, compared with
Dollars 339m in 1991.
General Dynamics now groups its earnings into two categories. One covers the
four core businesses it plans to keep and other operations it is selling.
It said continuing operations produced earnings of Dollars 62m on sales of
Dollars 1.7bn, compared with 1991's earnings of Dollars 40m on sales of
Dollars 1.4bn.

APPLE COMPUTER, the US personal computer manufacturer, reported record
fourth-quarter and yearly revenues and earnings despite an industry-wide
price war and rising competitive pressures.
Sales volumes of Apple's Macintosh personal computers were up by over 35 per
cent in the fourth quarter and exceeded 20 per cent for the year, said Mr
John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive. Fourth-quarter revenues
were Dollars 1.8bn, up 17 per cent on last year's Dollars 1.5bn, while net
income rose to Dollars 97.6m, or 81 cents a share, from Dollars 81.2m or 67
cents.
Annual revenues were Dollars 7.1bn, up 12 per cent, with net income jumping
to Dollars 530.4m, or Dollars 4.33 from Dollars 309.8m or Dollars 1.16 in
1991 when there was a third-quarter restructuring charge of Dollars 138.9m,
after tax.
Lotus Development, the US personal computer software company, reported a 6
per cent dop in third-quarter revenues but
a pre-tax gain of Dollars 34.6m from the sale of stock in Sybase, another
software company, brought net income for the quarter to Dollars 30.1m, or 72
cents a share, up from Dollars 21.5m, or 48 cents, last year. Revenue was
Dollars 206.7m, down from Dollars 218.8m.
Nine-month net income rose 76 per cent to Dollars 65.8m, or Dollars 1.52 a
share, from Dollars 37.3m or 84 cents. Revenue rose 13 per cent to Dollars
654.1m, from Dollars 579.7m.
Borland International, the personal computer software company, reported
lower than expected second-quarter earnings.
Revenue rose 12.2 per cent to Dollars 127.8m from Dollars 113.9m last year.
Net income was Dollars 5.4m, or 20 cents a share, compared with a net loss
of Dollars 103m a year ago.
First-half revenues were Dollars 242.6m, against Dollars 251.1m last year.
Earnings Dollars 7.1m or 26 cents a share compared with a loss of Dollars

MAYTAG, the US home appliance manufacturer that owns the Hoover brand in
Europe, yesterday reported a Dollars 50.2m loss after tax in the three
months to end-September, compared with a Dollars 24.2m profit a year ago.
The loss came after a one-off Dollars 95m reorganisation charge, which
Maytag had already announced, and some accounting changes. However, even
with these factors stripped out, the appliance manufacturer said that
operating profits would have been Dollars 39.1m, down from Dollars 53.5m a
year earlier.
It blamed continued losses in Europe - Hoover Europe produced a Dollars
16.2m deficit in the first nine months of 1992, on sales of Dollars 346.9m,
compared with a Dollars 8.9m loss in the first three quarters of 1991 -
together with the costs of a new facility in Tennessee, a new product line,
competitive pressures, and general economic conditions.
Last month, Maytag announced it was talking to Germany's Bosch-Siemens
Hausgerate, about an alliance.

JAPAN'S oldest department store, Mitsukoshi, yesterday sent shock waves
through the retailing sector by announcing it had made an operating loss of
Y379m (Dollars 3.16m) in the first half of this fiscal year.
Mitsukoshi was one of a clutch of leading retailers, from supermarkets to
department stores, which yesterday reported steep falls in profits under the
impact of the current severe downturn in Japanese consumer markets.
Mitsukoshi's pre-tax profits fell by 87 per cent to Y1,227m in the six
months to the end of August on a 2.8 per cent drop in sales. The company,
which invested heavily in expansion and refurbishment in the past five years
expects its full-year pre-tax profits to fall by about 83 per cent to
Y1.7bn.
Mitsukoshi is cutting capital expenditure for the year from a planned Y25bn
to Y10bn and directors are taking a 10 per cent pay cut.
Seven-Eleven Japan, the leading convenience store reported a 5.1 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Y45bn for the first half of the year, on a
10.6 per cent increase in sales to Y91.7bn. The company forecasts pre-tax
profit growth for the year of about 9.4 per cent to Y85bn.
However, Seven-Eleven's supermarket group parent, Ito-Yokado, reported only
a 0.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y48bn in the first half, on a
4.6 per cent sales increase to Y749bn.
Ito-Yokado's consolidated results, which include all its subsidiaries such

depressed, with pre-tax profit down in the first half by 12.1 per cent to
Y97bn on sales growth of 11.3 per cent to Y1,523bn.
Among other retailers reporting, Marui announced a 54 per cent drop in first
half pre-tax profits to Y321m, Daimaru department store pre-tax profits fell
by 47.4 per cent to Y1.6bn, Matsuzakaya reported a fall of 70 per cent to
Y1.5bn while Nichii, the supermarket chain, announced its was reviewing its
business forecasts after a 1.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y12.9bn.

BANCO POPULAR, Spain's most profitable commercial bank, yesterday reported a
fall in third-quarter income, indicating that most groups in the sector are
likely to suffer declines as the domestic economic slowdown begins to bite.
Popular reported a 12.7 per cent rise in net income to Pta40bn (Dollars
385m) over the first nine months of the year against the same period in
1991. The figure contrasted with a net income rise of 18.9 per cent to
Pta27.8bn in the first six months of this year, and it reflected a 10.4 per
cent drop in net profits between July and September against the second
quarter.
Customer funds grew by 3.5 per cent over the first nine months but by only
0.2 per cent in the third quarter. Loans and discounts grew by 10.3 per cent
and by 2.8 per cent respectively. Non-performing loans, which were brought
down from a 2.21 per cent high of total risks in March to 2.02 per cent on
June 30, had risen again to 2.20 per cent.
Net return on average assets stood at 2.11 per cent over the first nine
months against 1.92 per cent in the same period last year and average return
on equity was up from 26.73 per cent to 27.10 per cent.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia to adopt mineral
licensing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA IS about to finalise a licensing system for the exploitation of both
new and old deposits of its mineral wealth in an important step towards
building a market system.
Mr Viktor Orlov, head of the state geology committee, said yesterday that
the state had already begun to collect royalties last month on the basis of
temporary instructions. It is these instructions, issued to give substance
to an earlier law on mineral deposits, which will be made permanent by a
government decision expected within days.
After decades of waste and abuse resulting from an absence of licensing
arrangements, which are common in the capitalist world, the Russian
royalties will have to be paid by both foreign and Russian enterprises.
The licences will also set clear terms for the use of resources to cut down
on waste and environmental damage which is so rife of the oil gas and mining
sectors. If the Russian authorities are able to enforce licensing
conditions, the new system may also help cut down on corruption.
Mr Orlov said the royalty rates levied since September as a percentage of
the value of what is produced included: 8 per cent for oil, gas and coal,
2.4-4 per cent for strategic metals, up to 10 per cent for gold, and 5 per
cent for diamonds and precious stones. These could be adjusted upwards or
downwards for depreciation and other factors, and rates for existing
deposits may be changed in the government's final document. Royalties for
new deposits will be determined by tendering authorities.
Chevron, the US oil company, and the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan
have agreed to go ahead from January 1, 1993, with a 50:50 joint venture to
exploit the huge Tengiz oil field, Russian news agencies said yesterday,
reports Reuter from Moscow.
Industry analysts say Tengiz is regarded as one of the world's top ten
fields with probable reserves up to 35bn barrels. Current output is just
60,000 barrels a day.
Chevron clinched a deal to help increase the volume in May and Itar-Tass
news agency said details had now been firmed up during a visit by Chevron
chief Mr Kenneth Derr, when he met Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh
president.

John Maunders, the property developer, lifted pre-tax profit by 10 per cent
in the year to June 30, after reduced interest charges.
Units sold increased 13 per cent to 783, but at an average selling price of
Pounds 65,900 (Pounds 78,300) turnover fell to Pounds 51.6m (Pounds 54.4m).
With interest charges cut to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 2.59m) the pre-tax profit
worked through at Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.63m).
Mr John Maunders, the chairman, said the result was outstanding taking into
account the atrocious trading conditions.
The final dividend is held at 2.65p for a maintained total of 4.95p.
Earnings per share were 10.92p (9.81p).

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Argyll makes Pounds 23m supermarket buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGYLL Group has spent Pounds 23m buying nine Grandways supermarkets from
William Jackson, the Hull-based food manufacturer and retailer, in a deal
which symbolises the ever-growing power of the national grocery chains.
The family-run William Jackson said it was 'inappropriate' to continue
operating its Grandways supermarket chain in a marketplace dominated by
'some excellent and much larger national retailers'.
Instead, the company said it would switch its resources in a 'radical move'
to become a 'major player in the convenience store sector within a short
period of time'.
William Jackson, which has been developing the convenience store concept
over the past 18 months, intends to open 32 stores by Christmas and will use
the proceeds of the Grandways disposal to accelerate its opening programme.
The company added it was in negotaitions with another group to dispose of
its 12 remaining Grandways supermarkets and expected to make a further
announcement shortly.
Argyll will convert eight of the Grandways supermarkets in the Midlands and
north east England into Presto stores with the biggest 35,000 sq ft outlet,
located in Willerby, North Yorkshire, being transformed into a Safeway
superstore.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Depressed demand and competition mean
losses for Hi-Tec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPRESSED consumer spending and severe competition from US rivals led to an
interim loss at Hi-Tec Sports, the designer and marketer of sports shoes and
leisure wear.
The pre-tax loss was Pounds 2.84m in the six months to July 31, a downturn
from a Pounds 3.74m profit. The UK was worst affected, recording an
operating deficit of Pounds 900,000 compared to a Pounds 4.2m profit.
Losses per share were 4.86p (earnings 6.67p) and the interim dividend is cut
to 1p (1.65p). The shares fell 7p to 41p.
Mr Ashley Reynolds, group services director, described the results as
'extremely disappointing'. He said Hi-Tec would be profitable in the second
half, although it was too early to say if the first half losses would be
eliminated.
Markets had been hit by oversupply of leading brands following optimistic
ordering last year. The situation was made worse by price cutting by US
manufacturers, who shifted excess stock to the UK. Hi-Tec had to cut gross
margins by an average 10 per cent.
Turnover fell to Pounds 45.9m (Pounds 64.3m). North America was the only
region to increase sales, up 19 per cent to Pounds 11.9m, helped by strong
sales of outdoor footwear.
Continental Europe reported an operating loss of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 100,000
profit) mainly because of seasonal reasons with the 'Bad Boys' brand in the
Netherlands. Mr Reynolds said the second half would be much stronger.
Interest costs were contained to Pounds 977,000 (Pounds 1.34m) helped by the
proceeds of a Pounds 10.3m rights issue in February. Net borrowings fell
Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 18.5m, giving gearing of 50 per cent.
COMMENT
With these figures Hi-Tec has achieved its goal of reducing the proportion
of UK profits, but not with the style or smoothness it hoped for. Although
the reasons for the poor UK performance are compelling, they merely
highlight how vulnerable smaller players like Hi-Tec can be when the US
majors go for volume. The other problem, consumer confidence, is unlikely to
improve quickly, either, and the UK - which last year supplied 60 per cent
of operating profits - is likely to record a loss for the full year. There
are brighter spots in the US and the Netherlands, for example, but full year
forecasts are now for no better than break even. Shareholders who subscribed
for the rights at 150p have already lost more than two thirds of their
investment. Until there are more signs of recovery in core businesses, or
outstanding growth in the peripheries, those losses will be hard to recoup.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Finnish banks incur FM6bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CRISIS in Finland's financial sector deepened yesterday after three of
the country's leading banks announced losses of more than FM6bn (Pounds
759m) for the first eight months.
The scale of the losses forced the government to reiterate its support for
the sector as it warned that billions more markka in new state grants would
be needed next year.
Three of the leading banks, Unitas (the holding company for the Union Bank
of Finland), Skopbank and Kansallis-Osaki-Pankki (KOP), warned that their
performance was unlikely to improve in the final four months, with total
losses for the year likely to exceed FM9bn.
The banks have been battered by the severe Finnish recession and the high
level of real interest rates. Credit losses and non-performing loans have
soared. Rising funding costs, stagnant credit demand and falling share
prices have added to difficulties.
The most severe problems are being encountered by small and medium-sized
businesses, many of which have been forced into bankruptcy, but the personal
sector has not escaped the ravages caused by a 13 per cent unemployment
rate. Total credit write-offs announced by the three banks for the first
eight months amounted to FM5.2bn.
The problems mean that Unitas, the holding company for the Union Bank of
Finland, will now seek FM1.75bn in preference capital from the government,
the maximum possible sum allowed under a FM8bn scheme set up earlier this
year.
Skopbank, which had to be rescued by the Bank of Finland last year, has said
it will need additional financial support before the end of the year. KOP
has indicated it may have to seek support from the FM20bn state guarantee
fund early next year if losses continue at current levels.
Mr Vesa Vainio, Unitas chief executive said: 'High domestic interest rates
are the banking sector's most acute problem. Unless interest rates come
down, no increase in net income from financing operations, the banks' major
source of income, will be possible.'
Mr Jorma Aranko, director-general of the Finnish banking supervision
authority, suggested the state may convert financial support into majority
stakes.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is one election-year battle that the Republican party has usually won
by this stage in the campaign: the battle to raise money.
Yet the comfortable flow of funds to the incumbent, President George Bush,
has slowed to a trickle in recent months and the Republicans find themselves
in the unaccustomed position of having less money in their campaign chest
than do the Democrats. In July-September, the Democrats raised Dollars 43.5m
in campaign contributions, says the public interest watchdog Common Cause,
compared with only Dollars 26.7m for the Republicans.
The presidential candidates of the two main parties receive Dollars 55m each
from the federal government, in return for accepting limits on their
campaign spending. On top of this, each party can raise Dollars 10m in
personal contributions of up to Dollars 20,000 apiece.
The Democrats had already raised their Dollars 10m for Governor Bill Clinton
by the end of August; the Republicans had only raised Dollars 2.4m by
mid-September.
However, parties can get around these limits by the use of 'soft' money,
which is not used directly for the candidate, but for more general ends such
as voter registration drives and party advertising.
Soft money can include major corporate donations. Tobacco companies such as
RJR Nabisco, which has hedged its bets with big gifts to both the
Republicans and the Democrats, are big donors.
One additional effect of the Republicans' cash shortfall is that, with less
than three weeks to go before the election, Mr Bush still has to devote a
substantial portion of his time to fund-raising events, whereas Mr Clinton
can concentrate solely on campaigning.
Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire running as an independent candidate,
will receive no federal money, so is not bound by any spending limit.
He announced his withdrawal from the election in July but spent about
Dollars 7m, almost entirely from his personal fortune, keeping his candidacy
alive before deciding to relaunch his campaign at the end of September.
Since then, he has spent heavily on national television advertising.
Efforts to reform Congressional campaign financing laws failed this year
when Mr Bush vetoed a bill backed by the Democrats, which would have
introduced a system matching, in some respects, that used for presidential
campaigns, where candidates would receive partial federal funding in
exchange for voluntary spending limits.
The average cost of a victorious House of Representatives campaign rose to
Dollars 400,000 in 1990, and a Senate seat cost nearly ten times as much.
Reports to the Federal Election Commission so far this year suggest
candidates are spending much more to get themselves elected on November 3.
The idea of a cap on campaign spending meets much voter support, but any
limit can only be voluntary because the Supreme Court has ruled that
mandatory limits would infringe a candidate's constitutional right to free
speech.

The group has been undergoing a sweeping restructuring which has resulted in
a NKr2.229bn consolidation of the balance sheet, to NKr1.752bn.
Freight income on a time-charter basis fell to NKr774m from NKr1.319bn due
to a reduction in the size of the fleet.
The group suffered a NKr61m loss on sales of ships compared with a NKr234m
gain last year, but net financial costs were reduced by half to NKr41m.

<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST capital project undertaken by a Training and Enterprise Council,
a Pounds 10m business training centre described as Britain's first
commercial campus, will be inaugurated today.
Northumberland Tec has bought Longhirst, a listed mansion in 45 acres of
parkland near Morpeth, for management training and business education.
Tecs deliver government-funded training schemes in England and Wales,
Longhirst Hall, built in 1824, is to be refurbished and run from September
next year by the Tec as a management training and conference centre.
The Northumberland Tec will also build a business college for the expanding
University of Northumbria at Newcastle, formerly Newcastle Polytechnic.
The college, opening in stages from September, will offer degree, diploma
and certificate courses in business studies, management, marketing and
accountancy for 600 full-time and part-time students, with a target of 1,000
by 2000.
Proposed developments include a block of 75 bedrooms for the management
training centre, housing for 200 university students and a business
innovation centre with start-up units.
The Tec's budget this year is Pounds 17.5m, of which Pounds 15.5m is from
government sources. It is putting around Pounds 2m of its operating surplus
into the project and has also arranged bank loans. Longhirst was bought for
just under Pounds 1m.
To meet its Pounds 10m target, it is looking for private finance and
European funding and is negotiating for venture capital.

THE AREA of countryside lost every year to urban sprawl may be twice as
great as government figures suggest, according to a report by the Council
for the Protection of Rural England, the rural pressure group.
In the first survey of land-use since the second world war, the CPRE claims
that 'an area the size of Exeter, Norwich and Oxford' could be urbanised
each year.
The survey argues that farmers have consistently under-reported the area of
land which is no longer used for farming.
It claims that 'an area the size of Greater London has been 'lost' from
official figures'.
Using new data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
together with environmental surveys, the CPRE suggests that the current rate
of urbanisation could be as much as 11,000 hectares a year.
The government's figures are nearer 5,000 hectares a year.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Franco pledge on Brazilian reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S acting president Itamar Franco said yesterday his government
remained committed to the 'basic principles' of the modernisation programme
started by President Fernando Collor, who was suspended last month on
corruption charges.
In a message to the Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in Great Britain,
yesterday celebrating its 50th anniversary, Mr Franco underlined his support
for 'the full normalisation of our relations with the international
financial community, the uninterrupted implementation of the privatisation
programme and the opening up of the Brazilian economy.'
He said Brazil would always welcome foreign capital wishing to share the
risks of the market economy and the challenges of development.
In a speech to the chamber, Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the UK Board
of Trade, urged the Brazilian government to move quickly with the
implementation of adequate intellectual property legislation and to continue
to reduce tariffs, which currently average 20 per cent. He also stressed the
importance of Brazil's fiscal reform efforts.
He welcomed recent moves by the Brazilian government to improve the climate
for foreign investment, and said he looked forward to the removal next year
of constitutional limitations on foreign investment in mining and oil and
gas exploration, production and refining.
He said British companies, which already had about Pounds 1.5bn of
investments in Brazil, were particularly interested in developing trade in
several sectors: the construction of the gas pipeline between Bolivia and
Sao Paulo; cellular telephones and fibre optics; ports and airports; oil and
gas production; water treatment and consumer products.

FT  16 OCT 92 / French threat to farm reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE has no intention of complying with agreed reforms to the Common
Agriculture Policy (CAP), senior European Commission officials said in
Brussels yesterday.
Since France is Europe's main farming superpower, and its leading farm
exporter, this may put in jeopardy principal aims of the reform, including
substantial cuts to the farm subsidy regime that is hobbling the EC budget.
It would also explain France's increasingly fierce opposition to a
compromise settlement on the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
liberalisation, raising fresh doubts about whether a deal can be reached.
Optimism among Community negotiators that they are able to conclude a deal
with the US is underpinned by an assumption that the CAP reforms agreed in
May will deliver the farm subsidy cuts demanded by the US and other farm
exporters.
Hopes have risen this week that a breakthrough is imminent in the
long-stalled Uruguay Round negotiations, following US-EC talks in Brussels
early this week, which reached tentative agreement on two of three
unresolved disputes over subsidised farm trade.
Negotiators failed to settle the last outstanding issue, on the EC's oilseed
subsidy regime, because the US could not be convinced that proposed CAP
reforms would deliver the cuts that EC officials say would follow.
During talks aimed at persuading intransigent French officials that a Gatt
deal can be agreed without adding to reforms already worked out under the
CAP reform, senior European Commission officials have told the French that
even if the EC accepts the full 24 per cent cut in subsidised cereals
exports the US wants, the Community will still be able to export 23.5m
tonnes in six years' time.
This would be more than the 19m tonnes of exports projected under the reform
of the CAP.
But French officials told them they do not believe the CAP reform will work
or be adhered to. 'It is clear now that France never really intended to
comply with CAP reform,' one senior Commission official declared yesterday.
If Washington now concludes that France, the US's main competitor, thinks
the CAP reform which underpins the Gatt negotiations is not to be taken
seriously, their last-ditch efforts to obtain a deal may evaporate. The
danger of a trade war between the US and the EC would then be grave, with
the entire international trading system likely to be affected.
The French position ignores inconvenient facts, EC officials say:
it is the US, which originally wanted 90 per cent cuts on export subsidies
and 75 per cent cuts on internal support, that has moved towards the EC
negotiating position, which most Community officials see as strengthened by
President Bush's electoral plight.
Quite apart from France's commitments under CAP reform, President
Mitterrand, UK prime minister John Major and Mr Delors all agreed at July's
Munich summit of the Group of Seven on a 21 per cent cut in subsidised food
exports, according to member-state and Commission officials.
The 24 per cent cut sought by Gatt and the US was originally put forward by
Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister and then EC president, at a meeting in
The Hague last November with Mr Bush.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has praised Brazil for its
sweeping trade liberalisation programme, implemented despite serious
economic difficulties in just two years.
In a report yesterday the Gatt secretariat says the reforms have achieved
impressive results in changing Brazil's tradition of inward-looking
policies.
However, Gatt warns that liberalisation efforts could be put at risk by
failure to tackle rampant inflation and achieve sustained economic growth.
Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's Gatt ambassador, assured Gatt's governing council
during discussion of the report that the new government of President Itamar
Franco was committed to liberalisation. He said economic reforms commanded a
growing consensus within Brazilian society.
Mr Amorim said Brazil's former policy of import substitution and state
intervention, under which it had built up its diversified industrial base to
become the world's tenth biggest economy, had not failed but had reached its
limits.
Trade liberalisation has been a key element in Brazil's structural
adjustment programme adopted by the incoming democratic government in March
1990 to stabilise the economy and boost industrial efficiency and
competitiveness.
Since 1990 the Brazilian government has scrapped almost all import
restrictions, streamlined trade procedures and slashed tariffs. Remaining
restrictions in the informatics sector are due to end this month and by
mid-1993 tariffs will average just over 14 per cent against 41 per cent in
1989.
However, the Gatt secretariat says price and exchange rate stability, and
sustained economic growth, are 'a necessary condition' for consolidation of
the reforms. 'Failure to control inflation, to revive economic activity, and
to tackle rising unemployment, would increase the political odds against the
success of the liberalisation experiment.'
The report adds that Brazil's membership of the Southern Cone Common Market
(Mercosur) cannot provide a substitute for a successful conclusion to the
Uruguay Round of global trade talks, which would improve Brazil's access to
markets in industrial nations for its exports.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fall in volume cuts UDO 37%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTON MORAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UDO HOLDINGS, which supplies drawing office equipment and reprographic
services, saw year-end pre-tax profit fall 37 per cent in recessionary
trading conditions from Pounds 9.03m to Pounds 5.71m, writes Walton Morais.
Turnover fell from Pounds 55.84m to Pounds 51.71m in the year to July 31.
Despite measures taken to modify the operational structure, no amount of
savings in overheads could offset the profit lost by the volume fall.
The company made provisions of Pounds 300,000 for further rationalisation
and reorganisation costs, which pushed total exceptional charges to Pounds
517,000 (Pounds 213,000).
Although earnings per share fell to 13.66p (20.78p), the company is
recommending a final dividend of 4.76p for a 17 per cent increase in the
total payment to 6.70p. The company cited a strong balance sheet to justify
the increased payment. Cash balance at year-end stood at Pounds 13.3m,
making up 46 per cent of net assets. The dividend cover stood at 2 times,
down from about 3.5 times.
The slight decline in the cash balance, from Pounds 13.4m, was largely due
to Pounds 2.9m cash spent on four longer-term strategic acquisitions to
increase geograpical coverage or extend services provided. This also led to
a 22 per cent fall in interest income to Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 1.75m).
Mike Wright, chairman, said the strong balance sheet was achieved through
close attention being paid to cash generation and the monitoring of working
capital.
Mr Wright forecast another tough year ahead for the group because there was
no forseeable improvement in trading conditions.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Property costs cut BNB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BNB RESOURCES, the recruitment, training and advertising group, suffered a
sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.26m to just Pounds 53,000 in the
first half of 1992.
The human resources side lifted its profits from Pounds 828,000 to Pounds
1.37m in the face of 'intense downward pressure' in UK recruitment markets,
said Mr David Norman, chairman. But property costs climbed to Pounds 827,000
(Pounds 341,000) because of a rent review in December 1991 and also because
the company had about 40 per cent of its building vacant for a time. This
space is now refurbished and used by ATC.
ATC, the chartered accountancy training company acquired at the end of 1991
for a total Pounds 5.25m, was the other main cause of the group downturn. Mr
Norman said that, although modest profits had been expected in ATC's first
year, revenues had declined by about 15 per cent because fewer students were
enrolling in the first half and more in the second. He expected the training
division would break even over the full year.
NB Selection's revenues grew 45 per cent and profits were doubled. Mr Norman
said the group was lifting market share in recruitment, often at the expense
of financially weaker competitors. Norman Broadbent International lifted
revenues by 16 per cent in the UK, 79 per cent in Hong Kong and 51 per cent
in the US.
The group had cash balances of Pounds 3m. Earnings fell to 0.1p (3.9p) per
share, leaving the interim dividend, maintained at 1.6p, uncovered.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (3): Crowd control a priority - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS a good time of year to be visiting Cumbria. The chances of rain are
much as they are in any other season, but the autumn colours in Lakeland are
the best, the crowds have receded, and there is an air of mellowness which
becomes the ancient, weather-beaten fells, and the stone-walled farms and
villages.
If you do go, you will be pleasing the Cumbria Tourist Board which is trying
to spread the tourist season away from the summer peak. And that matters,
because Lakeland's problem is increasingly one of over-use: too many cars,
fellwalkers and speedboats.
Not that this year has seen much increase in those pressures. The CTB's
mid-year survey showed fewer than a third of tourism businesses enjoyed more
custom than last year.
'The recession has certainly bitten up here, though I think Cumbria is
holding up better than most,' says Mrs Judy Johnson who runs holiday
cottages at Cartmel.
In a typical year, people make about 2.75m trips to Cumbria and spend over
Pounds 300m. The average holiday is 12 days. These figures include about
250,000 foreigners who pass through for a night or two. Tourism now ranks
number two in the county after manufacturing, surpassing farming which is in
decline - itself a matter of concern to the tourist industry.
Cumbrian tourism falls into two broad categories: the central area with the
beauties of the Lake District, and the outlying areas with fewer obvious
charms but much eagerness to share in the benefits.
The CTB's policy is to try and sustain the growth of the industry, though
without harming the very attractions that people come to see. Some might
feel that that is an impossible task. On a hot August week-end traffic can
come to a virtual standstill, while anyone struggling to the top of the Old
Man of Coniston might just as well be standing on Brighton beach.
The resulting wear and tear can be considerable. The National Park is
working with local authorities on a traffic management project. Large
maintenance works are under way to repair fellside trails, and conserve lake
and river shores. A row is also rumbling over plans to impose a 10mph speed
limit on Lake Windermere to limit noise.
Other attacks on the environment can seem more gratuitous. A notorious case
is the plan to build a windfarm on Kirkby Moor overlooking Ulverston. This
site, admittedly on the fringes of the Lake District but nonetheless
prominent, is to be dotted with 12 giant windmills to produce electricity at
a time when the big national generation companies are closing down plant
because of a capacity surplus.
One way of dealing with the pressure from tourism is to encourage people to
come at different times, or visit more out of the way places, such as the
Eden Valley to the east, Carlisle to the north, and Cartmel and Furness to
the south.
An area that is keen to attract more visitors is the west, which has been
badly hit by declining industries but enjoys none of the benefits of
communities close to the M6 in the east. An ambitious programme to raise the
number of visitors by 5 per cent a year during the 1990s and to create 1,000
jobs is ahead of target.
'Even though we're in recession, the numbers are growing,' says Joan Ellis
of the West Cumbria Development Agency. The region's appeal include the
western lakes and fells, the seaside and specific attractions like Muncaster
Castle and the Ravenglass miniature railway. A surprising hit has been the
Sellafield nuclear facility - once denounced as a blight by the local
tourist business - which now draws 150,000 visitors a year with its
open-door policy.
The quality of Cumbrian tourism depends a lot on the strength of local
support. As it becomes more of a year-round business, it provides more
secure employment, and efforts are being made to improve training of staff
and involve local communities.
But Cumbria's farm population is shrinking - specially in the uplands - as
the economics of Lakeland agriculture deteriorates because of tight prices
and production quotas. The fear is that as the farming community dwindles,
so will the well-cared-for appearance of the Lake District itself.
To combat this, the county last year launched the Upland Cumbria Initiative,
a fund to help farmers maintain the fabric of the area by repairing dry
stone walls and improving footpaths - something they previously did as a
'free' service.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (2): Ten steps forward, 11 back - Economic
Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ECONOMIC developer's nightmare is about to come true in West Cumbria. The
recession, coupled with the next round of job losses at British Nuclear
Fuels (BNF), will by next March have wiped out the same number of jobs as
those created by various vigorous initiatives in the past 10 years.
Jobs lost, or about to be, since the recession began in 1990 include 350 at
Cumberland Clothing, 35 at Cumberland Leisure, 80 at Design Fabrique, 150 at
Supamoor, 450 at Volvo Buses - which is moving to Scotland - 130 at Davy
Distington and 500 at Miller's Footwear.
Mr Tony Winterbottom, chief executive of the West Cumbria Development Agency
(WCDA), says: 'We reckon on having helped generate about 4,000 new jobs in
the last 10 years. Apart from the bigger recent closures caused by
recession, about 1,000 more jobs have been lost in a range of smaller
businesses. We still have a net gain of about 1,000 jobs, but Sellafield's
redundancies will wipe those out.'
BNF is shedding jobs, now that construction of its thermal oxide
reprocessing plant is complete. It will be West Cumbria's third dose of
large-scale structural unemployment since 1982, when steel industry closures
caused the first shock, pushing up unemployment to 23 per cent.
This was followed by the end of deep coalmining in Whitehaven in 1985.
British Steel Industry (BSI), the job-creation agency and fund-provider set
up by British Steel, was soon joined by British Coal Enterprise (BCE), its
counterpart for mine-closure areas, in the struggle for economic
reconstruction.
The locally-named Moss Bay Enterprise Trust - set up in 1982 to help
Workington - became the basis for Enterprise West Cumbria in 1985, expanding
to include Whitehaven. In 1988, BNF joined in to try to ensure the whole
area was ready for a succession of Sellafield doses of structural
unemployment in the early 1990s.
The WCDA succeeded Enterprise West Cumbria, while BNF also established a
separate fund to back promising businesses and developments in a similar way
to BSI and BCE. Each year the fund gets Pounds 1m a year from BNF and Pounds
50,000 each from Cumbria county and Allerdale and Copeland district
councils.
It sounds simple, but things have been more complex. The fund and agency
have different boards and there has sometimes been disagreement between them
on whether projects merit funding.
There has also been a sometimes confusing array of parallel or complementary
initiatives. There is a Whitehaven Development Company - comprising English
Estates, the WCDA and Copeland Borough Council - the government's Cumbria
Action Team, and the Rural Development Commission, which is very active in
the county.
In addition, Cumbria is a member of both the Newcastle-based Northern
Development Company and Inward, the north-west's agency. Both are regional
agencies for inward investment from abroad and, in the NDC's case, from
elsewhere in the UK. They are funded partly by the government's Invest in
Britain Bureau.
Then there are various other activities of the local authorities. Copeland,
for example, is a partner in the Tourist Strategic Development Initiative,
not to mention the work of bodies like Voluntary Action Cumbria and the
Prince's Trust.
On top of this is a Euro-input, since Workington, Whitehaven and Barrow are
all eligible for European Commission structural funds. And, of course, there
are still BSI and BCE, plus the local training and enterprise council.
Money from government since 1982 has totalled about Pounds 55m. This has
gone into cleaning derelict sites in Workington, and around its harbour of
Maryport, the building of advance factories by English Estates, and regional
development grants to help inward investment and expansion.
It has, however, helped lever about Pounds 260m from the private sector in
inward investment and this has helped to create 4,000 jobs - but as recent
events have shown, not all have been secure enough to withstand a deep
recession.
Mr Ken Dixon, the recently retired personnel director of Alcan's Cumbrian
plant, now chairs the WCDA. 'Most of our large companies are foreign-owned
and basically branch factories,' he says. 'In hard times, they are more
likely to cut the branches and go back to the trunk.'
He says a survey of 25 companies employing 6,200 people in the area showed
11 of them controlled from abroad, nine run from elsewhere in the UK and
only five with stay-or-go decision making power in Cumbria. The overall
position was that 5,000 of the 6,200 jobs were externally controlled, and
therefore more vulnerable than locally run - and, usually, owned -
businesses during a downturn.
Moreover, some inward investors have not been able to make much use of
Cumbria's depth of engineering and technological skills. And, part-time
feminisation of the workforce in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors
has not done much for long-term improvement of the local tax base or
spending power.
Indeed, Mr Winterbottom thinks the basic structural problem has been
disguised by BNF mopping up much male unemployment during its expansion
phase, now ending.
Mr Laurie Haveron, BSI's chief for northern England, says much future
investment needs to be targeted on existing locally-owned businesses to help
them improve their management and marketing so they can grow soundly.
This is no short-term panacea, however. BSI's own recent investments have
put about Pounds 250,000 into 12 projects, but none are big and even those
capable of large-scale, job- creating growth, will probably take years to
achieve it.
Meanwhile, there has been some disquiet among the main fund providers at the
plethora of efforts and parochialism. Inward investment policies have been
ad hoc and dependent on a sometimes tight availability of factory space.
Under political pressure, some funds have gone into propping up ailing
companies, postponing but not averting ultimate failure.
West Cumbria Development Fund recently asked Professor John Fyfe of
consultants WS Atkins to examine the effectiveness of the current structure
of economic regeneration bodies. His review has been the subject of lively,
but confidential discussions, and will result in modifications to both the
fund and the WCDA.
The fund and the agency will be merged into a new partnership which will be
refocused on areas where it is felt the greatest results can be achieved.
Meanwhile, Mr John Hancock, the WCDA's first chairman, is now chairing the
Cumbria Marketing Initiative, launched two weeks ago. He is a successful
private sector marketeer already, running Sealy beds - Silentnight's
thriving upmarket subsidiary - in Aspatria.
WCDA has seconded Ms Dawn Quigley as his full-time project director and they
are determined to cut through any confusion by establishing a clear image
for Cumbria.
Mr Hancock avers: 'I think things were fragmented. The marketing initiative
is not an organisation. We are a marketing campaign. We don't have a
bureaucracy, we are not a quango, and we don't threaten anyone. We shall be
trying to avoid looking backwards. If you spend too much time looking over
your shoulder you are likely to bump into lampposts.'

FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (4): Thorp jobs bubble bursts - The nuclear industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEEN GARDENER though he is, Mr Terry Byrne is spending more time these days
than he would wish among his plants.
Last month, he became one of the thousands being made redundant as
construction work at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site winds down.
At 53, Mr Byrne, who lives in nearby Egremont, thinks his only hope of
working again lies in possible future Sellafield developments. Prospects of
finding work elsewhere locally are grim; his 28-year-old stepson, whose
construction contract at Sellafield ended two years ago, has been
job-hunting ever since.
The Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant, a massive, world-league
complex in one of England's most isolated areas, dominates the economy of
Copeland borough.
More than 8,000 people are on the permanent Sellafield payroll and last year
contractors on the site, carrying out an investment programme worth Pounds
1.5m a day, employed a further 7,500. Even allowing for 'travelling men' -
contract workers hired from outside the county - Sellafield was employing
more than one in three of Copeland's workforce.
But this figure is now nosediving as construction work, especially on the
new Pounds 2.8bn Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP), due to begin
operating commercially next year, tails off.
Contract construction employment at Sellafield, already down to 4,700 in
mid-1992, is expected to drop to 1,500 by the end of 1993. As this bubble
bursts, it is becoming clear that Sellafield's presence has been masking
serious deficiencies in the local economy.
To make matters worse, the construction rundown has coincided with closure
of some significant local employers and the collapse of newer companies
which, it had been hoped, would diversify West Cumbria's employment base.
'Our failure rate this year will be worryingly high,' says Mr Alan Williams,
business manager of the West Cumbria Development Fund, set up by Copeland,
Allerdale and Cumbria councils and BNFL to try to diversify the local
economy. Four companies, employing in total more than 100, have closed since
March forcing the fund, into which BNFL puts Pounds 1m a year, to write off
Pounds 250,000.
A number of others which the fund has assisted are 'on the edge', says Mr
Williams. 'It's extremely frustrating, it's undoing a lot of the work we're
doing,' he says. 'With the BNFL lay-offs, the size of the problem is such
that it can't be resolved simply by business development; there's got to be
a significant level of inward investment.'
That view is widely shared in Copeland. Ironically, it was Sellafield
employment which contributed in the 1980s to keeping down Copeland's jobless
figures, resulting in loss of development area status in 1983. Since then,
says Mr Bob Metcalfe, the council's development and services director,
Copeland's sole new inward investment of any size has been a Scottish
supermarket.
Chemicals manufacturer, Albright and Wilson, the borough's second largest
private sector employer, is in Whitehaven. Now American-owned, the company
has shed jobs recently but invested heavily, spending Pounds 20m over the
last three years alone, largely on effluent discharge reduction. Its Marchon
works, dominating the Whitehaven skyline, provides 1,200 much-needed jobs; a
recent advertisement for two Pounds 3-an-hour part-time canteen staff to fry
chips for the nightshift yielded 400 applications.
Works director John Markham says Copeland's economy is fragile, even though
it has companies at the leading edge of technology.
The problems have various causes, one of which is poor transport
infrastructure. The main A595 running down the coast is in parts little more
than a country lane; the M6 motorway is an hour's drive from Whitehaven, on
very variable roads. A one-day return visit to London for a Copeland-based
businessperson is extremely difficult, and the A66 trip across the Pennines
to the A1 can be tortuous, especially for heavy lorries.
Another difficulty has been competition from Workington which has
development area and enterprise zone incentives. Local economic development
bodies are pushing for development area status for the Whitehaven travel to
work area, too. Its jobless rate, they predict, will rise from 9.6 per cent
now to 16.5 per cent at the end of 1993, largely due to the Sellafield
construction rundown.
History, too, has bequeathed problems. Having moved from dependence on
extractive industries, now largely defunct, to reliance on Sellafield,
Copeland has little tradition of enterprise culture. Its 1991 6.4 per cent
self-employment rate compares with 10.4 per cent for Cumbria overall and
11.2 per cent for the UK.
Cumbria's lack, prior to this autumn, of higher education facilities has
also led many of its brightest young people to leave the area. The new
Westlakes science and technology park, just south of Whitehaven, aims to
reverse this brain drain, and to build on the purchasing power of Sellafield
and its technology transfer potential by offering an attractive base for
knowledge-based companies.
The first phase is 60 per cent occupied but has so far brought in only one
business from outside Cumbria, south coast engineering company Gravatom, a
BNFL supplier.
BNFL is heavily committed to Westlakes. It has relocated its cytogenetics
and analytical services departments to a new Pounds 6m laboratory complex in
the park and invested Pounds 0.875m in the business space development. The
Rural Development Commission has also spent Pounds 0.875m, its largest-ever
single investment, and Pounds 1.1m has come from the European Community.
BNFL is also spending Pounds 2.5m on a new research institute at Westlakes.
Headed by Dr Roger Berry, formerly BNFL's director of health and safety, the
institute aims to become an independent unit, working for BNFL and other
clients as a centre of excellence for the study of genetics, biotechnology,
occupational health and environmental subjects.
The institute's first graduate students arrive this month; Dr Berry, who is
pursuing research contracts, is establishing links with Lancaster and
Newcastle Universities and has recruited microbiologist Professor Derek
Ellwood from Durham University to join the Westlakes research team.
BNFL's importance in West Cumbria cannot be overestimated but its presence
has negatives too. Local economic development bodies mostly deny Sellafield
exerts a deterrent effect on potential inward investors, but Copeland
council's Mr Metcalfe describes the nuclear industry as a double-edged
sword. While it is the bedrock of the local economy and a potential
attraction to some companies, he says he has evidence of industrialists who
have decided not to come, or have withdrawn investment, because of it.
Copeland people have generally defended Sellafield against what they see as
ill-informed attacks by environmentalists and outsiders. But feelings are
more mixed about the underground nuclear waste repository proposed by Nirex,
a nuclear industry body which does not enjoy the high regard locally in
which BNFL is held.
Why, many locals are asking, should they be expected to shoulder a national,
indeed international, problem which other communities in Britain have
vociferously fought off, and yet still suffer deficient infrastructure?
If the repository goes ahead, it promises to create 3,000 temporary
construction jobs, and up to 400 for operators on completion.
Before then, however, stretch years of controversy and emotive publicity
about the burial of radioactive waste deep underground. It is just the
publicity Copeland could do without.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (1): Local agony, national issue - Cumbria's economy
has been cushioned by defence spending and the nuclear industry, but the
good times have suddenly come to an end. A struggle to create new industries
and more jobs has just begun
</HEADLINE>

THESE ARE worrying times for Cumbria, the English county known best for the
Lake District. It is remote from much of England, and even more so from the
rest of Europe, but cannot be ignored, for national issues are involved.
It is not just the recession, that has wiped out around 2,000 jobs, but the
additional impact of two large doses of structural unemployment, which have
already resulted in the loss of many thousands more.
Cumbria is undergoing a traumatic change affecting two pillars of its
economic structure - warship building and nuclear fuels. Each has created a
fund of high technology talent and skills. The fear is many of these will go
to waste if they cannot be redirected.
The first dose of unemployment was expected: British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL)
has spent most of the past 10 years building Thorp, its controversial Pounds
2.8bn thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield. It is nearly complete,
and at least 6,000 construction jobs are coming to an end.
The community started getting ready for this in 1988, with BNFL putting in
the bulk of Pounds 1.15m a year of funding, in partnership with local
authorities, to try and help rebuild the local jobs market. A science park
has just opened as part of the process, but against a tide of recession,
there is little prospect of quick success.
Coping with this trauma would have been hard enough, but the end of the Cold
War has limited the market for warships. Once VSEL, the former Vickers
shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness, has finished the four nuclear submarines
needed for the Trident missile system, there will be no more such regular
orders from government.
More than 6,500 VSEL jobs have already gone and another 3,000 will
eventually reduce the workforce to 5,000. Prospects of doing better have
been dashed by the recession, which has prevented the company breaking
seriously into a depressed offshore market.
It is against this background that Cumbria is pressing the government to
grant development area status to Barrow, Whitehaven and Workington, and the
hinterlands from which they draw their labour. Local unemployment rates of
up to 17.7 per cent are forecast for next year.
Even intermediate status would be welcome, not only for the discretionary
government grants it would unlock, but because of the access it would give
to a wider range of European Commission funds. The government's dilemma is
that, increasingly, more areas are pressing for such special help as
recession bites, while the public purse-strings have been drawn tighter by
the latest economic crisis.
Cumbria, however, has suffered two other big rounds of structural
unemployment in the last 10 years, with the closure of the Workington
ironworks in 1982, followed by deep coalmining, centred on Whitehaven, three
years later.
The experience helps explain the impressive way in which people are
approaching their latest difficulties. Given positive thinking and the right
partnership between all involved, things can be turned round: Workington's
unemployment rate fell from 23 per cent in 1982 to 8.6 per cent in 1990. Of
course, development area status and an enterprise zone also helped.
Although recession has cut the net gain in jobs in the steel and coal
closure areas from 4,000 to 1,000 - and the Sellafield redundancies will
push the figure into net loss - no one is whingeing.
Indeed, Cumbria is on the reprise, renewing the attack, trying to accentuate
its assets. There are many, including the Lake District - although tourism
planners are also trying to promote the aptly-named Eden area and its
unspoiled Pennines of east Cumbria to ease pressure on the more popular
lakes and fells.
Moreover, old market centres such as Kendal, Penrith and Carlisle are
relatively well off because they are in the north-south M6 corridor. Indeed,
it is the comparative remoteness of Workington, Whitehaven and Barrow that
is one of the problems no amount of 'talking up' can counter.
Not that this has stopped the newly-launched Cumbria Marketing Initiative
from trying. It asserts in its flagship brochure that Cumbria is accessible
no matter where you are or want to get to. 'Good communications by rail,
road and sea make it easy to get into and get out of, both for people and
goods,' it claims.
The initiative, chaired by the energetic Mr John Hancock of the highly
successful Sealy bed manufacturer, is unanimously backed by public and
private sectors and the various job- creation agencies, yet these same
people and bodies are also campaigning for better roads.
'The Way Ahead,' a lobbying document they jointly produced last year, warns:
'The survival and development of West Cumbria is drastically threatened by
its totally inadequate, poor quality, transport network. West Cumbria as an
industrial region will not survive without urgent drastic action.'
Councillors and business leaders will be arguing their case again next month
with Mr Kenneth Carlisle, the roads minister.
Top priority is seen as the dualling of the A595/A66 route from Sellafield
to Scotch Corner - the A66's junction with the A1 route to Britain's east
coast ports - and of the whole A590 from Barrow to the M6.
At present, these routes are undergoing only piecemeal improvements,
although the Department of Transport's Transpennine strategy report,
published last month, has at least raised hopes of a complete dual
carriageway link between Penrith and Scotch Corner.
According to a recent consultants' report prepared for the county council,
Furness Enterprise and the West Cumbria Development Agency, the Pounds 195m
cost of comprehensively upgrading the A590, A595 and A66 into dual
carriageways would be more than recouped by the government, thanks to the
benefits of better road links in retaining jobs and attracting new inward
investment.
Cumbria's communications strategy, launched last November, also calls for
improvements to the west coast main rail line and high quality direct links
with the Channel Tunnel. The county's lack of scheduled air services is also
seen as a deficiency; a study into the feasibility of a West Cumbrian air
strip feeder service is in progress.
Because of the high technologies involved in the defence and nuclear
industries, Cumbria's roads lead to a highly qualified or skilled workforce
which could, as experience elsewhere shows, adapt easily to similar levels
of technical demands in other sectors.
The ethos and culture favour high quality, mistake-free manufacturing, but
on its own, the fear is this will not be enough.
Mr Harry Knowles, chief executive of Furness Enterprise, says: 'This is a
national issue. You cannot leave it to the local community to deal with. We
have an asset that has been built up over many years in terms of skills of
local people. If we have to rely entirely on local initiatives, we cannot
succeed. We need to be able to offer financial incentives to attract inward
investors.'
The local community is actually doing all it can to pull together -
impressing Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, with a
display of positive determination when he launched the Cumbria Marketing
Initiative in Barrow two weeks ago.
But courage is not enough. As though to prove Cumbria's needs, bad weather
forced Mr Heseltine to cancel half his programme because his helicopter
could not fly and roads were not quick enough for him to get to Sellafield
and back to London in time for a Cabinet meeting.
A few days before, a party of Korean electronics industry specialists had
been enjoying better weather, with perfect sunsets and the Lake District
turning golden with autumn.
'They were very happy with what they found out about the local skills base
and the prospects for recruitment,' Mr Knowles says. 'But they were looking
for the best package and we are up against competition from Scotland and
Wales. Without their sort of financial assistance, you are at an immediate
disadvantage.'

FT  16 OCT 92 / Arts: 'Flute' revived at the ENO - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Coliseum, John Abulafia has revived Nicholas Hytner's production of
Mozart's The Magic Flute with a sure hand. And perhaps an inventive one, too
 -there are telling bits of business that I had not remembered, and in any
case he had to accommodate a new pair of royal principals and a new trio of
Ladies. The gist of the original production remains intact: light touch,
plenty of unexpected details to refresh jaded appetites, attentive sympathy
with the whole unlikely tale.
Neither Bob Crowley's coolly elegant designs nor Nick Chelton's clever
lighting have faded by one jot. If Jeremy Sams' translation is too
sophisticated to answer very closely to Schikaneder's original text, its
knowing charm is nicely apt here. So is the contribution of Nicholas
Kraemer, the new conductor, who favours swift, 'period'-conscious tempi
(almost too swift for his orchestra in the overture) and yet ensures that
each of the little epiphanies gets full value.
The current cast is admirably even and unstarry though voice-fanciers will
be in no doubt about the stand-out performances. Those were Richard Van
Allen's Speaker, soberly, beautifully sung (and enunciated), and the
irresistibly fresh and eager Pamina of Gillian Webster, whose sculpted line
 -really distinguished in her G minor aria - carried no hint of a cut-glass
tinkle.
As Sarastro, John Connell managed only ghostly lowest-bass notes: a slight
cold, maybe. In middle register he offered commanding warmth and openness,
and acted the tetchy sage with a touch of self-satisfied mischief. For the
Queen of Night, Nan Christie's once bell-like tone has begun to spread a
bit, but her plucky attack on the coloratura heights was exciting - much
enhanced by fine, flamboyant histrionics where most Queens are content to
stand and deliver. Alan Opie's Papageno is an amiable bear now, full of
character but a degree glummer than he used to be.
At the cost of some tight, closed timbre, Paul Nilon's Tamino manages to be
staunchly stylish. As the evening goes on,he makes an ever deeper mark. The
new Three Ladies are Janice Watson, Susan Bickley and Therese Feighan, well
matched both musically and dramatically; without any vampish mugging they
convey both sexy sparks and comic malevolence. Geoffrey Pogson makes a
ripely plummy Monostatos, and Mary Hegarty a tough but fetching Papagena.
The Three Boys here (who will alternate with a second trio throughout the
run) didn't rise vocally to angelic heights, but they were appealingly
concerned and musically secure. Mostly, this Flute still gives unalloyed
pleasure.
In repertory at the English National Opera until November 13; revival
sponsored by United Airlines

FT  16 OCT 92 / Arts: Tales from Tasso - The Birmingham Poussin exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Prime Minister and his colleagues sought balm for their troubled
souls this week in Birmingham, they did not have far to go. Just as the EEC
cavalcade arrived at Birmingham, an exhibition opened at the city's art
gallery which includes no less than 15 works by the 17th-century master,
Poussin. Dangerous Liaison: Poussin's 'Tancred and Erminia' in Context
brings together some of the best-known and most beautiful masterpieces of
Poussin's early career.
The exhibition's creator is Richard Verdi, director of the Barber Institute
which houses Birmingham University's magnificent art collection, now
re-emerging after many years of obscurity. Verdi was the moving force behind
the remarkable Poussin and Cezanne exhibition some years ago in Edinburgh.
This further homage to Poussin is a great achievement - not least because
paintings from France, Russia, and Canada have been brought to Birmingham
without a penny being found from sponsors.
The starting-point is simple, a reminder of the prominent place that
now-forgotten tales of Tasso occupied among the repertoire of sacred and
secular themes in 17th-century history painting. The first room is something
of a hotchpotch of history painters selected from the two Birmingham
collections. It ranges from a neurotically vibrant 'Execution of John the
Baptist' by Schiavone to 'St Andrew Praying Before His Execution' by Carlo
Dolci and Jan Steen's convivial scene of Esther denouncing Hamon at King
Ahasuerus's dinner-table.
The second room is what really matters. Here we find the two astoundingly
beautiful 'Tancred and Erminias', one from the Barber and the other from the
Hermitage in St Petersburg. They hang next to the first theme Poussin took
from Tasso, the famous Dulwich 'Rinaldo and Armida'. What a heavenly trio of
paintings they make]
Here, at a glance, are the paintings which will dispel the common view that
Poussin is a chillingly cerebral artist whose appeal is strictly to
intellectuals.
Underlining this point, to their left hangs an earlier masterpiece of the
late 1620s, the Caen 'Venus and Adonis'. In this painting of melancholy
suffused with warm sensuality, a naked goddess kneels in tender solicitude
by the beautiful body of her dead lover. Beside this, showing just what a
mastery of dramatic effect Poussin had achieved, is the 'Deposition of
Christ from the Cross' from the Hermitage. It counts as one of the most
heart-rending realisations ever painted of this subject, and for it alone,
the trip to Birmingham is a must.
Here again, albeit pitched in an infinitely more intense and sombre key, is
a woman lamenting over the body of a man as the Virgin wrings her hands over
Christ as the Evangelist struggles to support his body. A crouching putto
leans its cheek against Christ's shin.
Grief, charity, love; these three emotions are evoked once again in the
Tancred and Erminia scenes. We may see in them at first sight a mildly
erotic but hardly profound scene, just the sort of thing one would expect
from Italian opera. But Poussin, for all his roaring, wenching first decade
in Rome, was anything but frivolous when it came to themes of his paintings.
The Tancred and Erminia story appeared in two brief, tender interludes in
Gerusalemme Liberata, Torquato Tasso's epic about the First Crusade. The
poem appeared in 1581 and became a best-seller. Poets, painters and
musicians took inspiration from it, readers borrowed the names of its heroes
and heroines for their children.
Opposite Poussin's two versions hang further Tancreds and Erminias as
visualised by Poussin's contemporaries in Rome; Guercino, Pietro da Cortina,
and by his admirer, Pier Francesco Mola, the last a ravishingly pretty
painting from the Louvre. Mola, imitating Poussin, chose the most dramatic
moment of the story.
The noble warrior Tancred is grievously wounded in single combat with the
giant Argantes. Enter his squire and the Saracen princess Erminia, his fair
captive who loves him but has not a chance because he is pining after her
best friend, Clorinda. Erminia renders first aid to her lover but runs out
of bandages once she has used her veil.
'But love could other bands, though strange, provide, And pity wept for joy
to see that deed . . .' Erminia sacrifices her crowning joy, her 'amber
locks'; As read, this comes across a strongly sexual motif, given the
ancient symbolism of hair. But Tasso's poem was an explicitly Christian
allegory on the triumph of the Church. Erminia's gesture echoes the
Magdalene who dried Christ's feet with her hair - Mola brings this out in
his version with the little box on the rock, a reminder of the Magdalene's
jar of ointment. Pagan Erminia, like the prostitute Magdalene, is a sinner
and she, too, will surely be redeemed.
The exhibition shows how in formal terms, Poussin's grouping of the figures
in his Tancred and Erminias echoes a Lamentation over the dead Christ.
Erminia is the Magdalene, and she is also the Virgin in her traditional blue
robe. In the Birmingham picture Erminia in her bare shouldered dress is
something of a maenad. She saws frenziedly at her hair with Tancred's sword,
whereas in the earlier, more tender and beautiful Hermitage version (a point
on which Verdi insists) we have no doubt the amber locks will yield to the
blade as easily as silk threads.
Tasso never actually says what happens to the pair, once Tancred is safely
back in camp with his rescuer. Poussin uses his putti in the Birmingham
picture to hint at the eventual happy outcome. They float aloft, one
garlanded with presumably nuptial flowers, both armed with the burning
arrows of love. Erminia will convert to Christianity and they will be happy
together. Charity and self-sacrifice bring their own reward. That, surely,
is the deeper reading Poussin intended for his tales from Tasso.

So far the BBC's social affairs series Public Eye has caused remarkably
little excitement. Perhaps today's programme, the first in a fresh series,
will change that. Called 'The Mad Cow Contagion', it is concerned with BSE,
an epidemic it says has become far more widespread than was ever predicted,
and which has now crossed into a number of other species (8.00 BBC2).
That is followed (8.30) by Royal Gardens, a series presented by Sir Roy
Strong who seems to be teetering on the brink of Crazed Pundit Syndrome: the
condition in which people such as Magnus Pike and David Bellamy cease to be
primarily presenters and become, instead, the arm-waving subjects of their
programmes. Strong already looks a bit like the chap with mutton-chop
whiskers who talks in tic-tac, and it would be no surprise to find him
describing Kew and Frogmore via semaphore.
The best new police series for years is Between The Lines, BBC1's drama
about an internal investigation unit. In today's episode a demonstration
turns into a riot but the investigators find themselves hampered by a police
commander (9.30).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The evenings grow chill, and post-modern dancers huddle together for shelter
under the Dance Umbrella as autumn takes hold. This year's jamboree began on
Wednesday night at Riverside Studios with two recent works from Siobhan
Davies performed by her troupe. They are planned, I suppose, as contrasting
aspects of her creativity. Make-Make is dark, constrained, and something of
a bore. But White Bird Featherless is light-filled, as teasing as one might
expect from a piece whose title is owed to an 18th century riddle, and
wonderfully bold and inventive in movement.
Make-Make (and what does that mean?) begins glumly with the sound of a
storm, rain pouring down a huge plastic sheet at the back of the dance area,
a layered babble of ethnic keening as sound-track, and figures looming in
the gloaming. We could be in any English holiday resort out of season. Where
we are, in fact, is an 'island' conceived by Miss Davies as a pen in which
to confine her six dancers. They make dull gestures and awkward mime. Small
cells of movement are generated, and build to a crescendo before the dance
returns to its original anxious signallings. There is one intriguing duet,
but the choreography does not flatter the dancers - they look costive, and
less than interesting. It was Sean Feldman who made the piece bearable for
me. His style is mercurial, quick-muscled, admirably varied and vivid in
dynamics. This bright gleam apart, the rain fell incessantly: il pleure dans
mon coeur comme il pleut sur la ville is the message.
Happily, White Bird Featherless showed us Siobhan Davies at her very best.
The piece is visually ravishing. A black setting has three looking glasses
on either side of the dance area. Peter Mumford casts a chequer-board of
light on to the floor. Antony Macdonald dresses the six members of the cast
in handsome white unisex outfits (trousers; flimsy shirts; armoured-looking
jerkins). The properties are cheerfully coloured wooden apples, pears,
pineapples, which feature in incidents that tease, intrigue, but never
obtrude into the clear fabric of the dance. Movement is inspired and
enriched - Siobhan Davies needs good music for her dances - by Gerald
Barry's strong score for two pianos and countertenor.
The white costuming, the shifting squares of light, encourage a first
impression of luminous, radiant action. But it is the dance itself, at times
buoyant and resourceful in mingling solos and ensembles, then contemplative
and questioning, which has the brightest glow. In its dynamic variety, in
its freshness of impetus, it shows Davies working at the very top of her
considerable form: caught up with ideas of movement itself, and eschewing
any introversion, it thrills the viewer.
The cast looked fine, with Gill Clark and Deborah Saxon having inspired some
rewarding incidents. But it was Mr Feldman, a newcomer to the troupe, who
again held the eye, notably in a solo that celebrated his light, sweeping
jump and the speed and richness of his response to a pose or a quick change
of direction in step. It is dancing of great distinction in a work no less
excellent. Let it please be filmed.
The Siobhan Davies Dance Company continues at Riverside Studios until Oct.
17; thereafter the company visits Sheffield, Cambridge, Newcastle upon Tyne.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Arts: Two Gentlemen of Verona and Lermontov's Last Dream -
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY and ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout David Thacker's RSC production of Two Gentlemen of Verona at the
Barbican - before, during scene-changes, and at the end - there occur
classic popular songs from the jazz/swing era. Great songs: 'Nice Work if
you Can Get it', 'And Then My Heart Stood Still,' 'Blue Moon,' 'In the Still
of the Night' and more. But will not some people in the audience go home
thinking that Shakespeare wrote them? Worse, will not some people miss them
if ever they see Two Gents again? Nobody would claim that this is
Shakespeare's best play, and there are passages when his words seem a lot
more remote than those of Irving Berlin, Cole Porter et al.
But those passages are not frequent. This production (first seen in
Stratford 18 months ago) is not one that apologises for the play; it trusts
it. Two Gents is always light and urbane; at its best, it is also
surprisingly touching. So it proves here. It is often strange how, even as
the play reminds you of situations that Shakespeare handled so much more
marvellously in other plays, you find yourself oddly affected.
At the heart of the action is the amorous perfidy of Proteus, courting first
Julia, then Silvia, both with sincere ardour, even though Silvia is his best
friend's girl. He is the male equivalent of the women in Cosi fan tutte, but
he is also an embryo Don Giovanni - especially in the balcony scene, where,
with Julia overhearing all, he courts Silvia. In this staging, Barry Lynch
is a beguiling Proteus - charming, intense, soft and urgent at the same
time, almost innocent in his treachery.
Set against his inconstancy are the steadfast affections of Julia and
Silvia. As Julia, Claire Holman is rather like a young Judi Dench; the voice
half-hoarse, half-creamy, the manner so vital and spontaneous. Josette
Bushell-Mingo (who has moved up from the role of Lucetta since Stratford) is
a perfect contrast. She has a kind of gravity, elegance and nobility that
naturally startle Proteus and make him forget Julia.
The play's more broadly comic scenes, which are really just Shakespearian
rotework, work here triumphantly. The dog Crab (played by Woolly), with his
lean and dolorous air, comes close to stealing the show. And, best of all,
that urbane beanpole Guy Henry makes Thurio as vivid as any character
onstage. His face is deadpan, his eyelids beat in hilarious bemusement, his
voice is a wonderfully humourless and solemn, and he catches exactly the
essence of a hangover. The character he plays is just a hollow drone, but
here he becomes a joy.
*****
The French Symbolist poets were not alone in fighting duels with friends.
Mikhail Lermontov, the Russian Romantic, was killed by his friend Martynov
on a cool July morning in 1841. Lermontov goaded his opponent; and light
mirth ended in grievous wounds.
Harry Meacher's complex, inventive biographic drama, Lermontov's Last Dream
for Pilgrim Productions at the Pentameters Theatre, starts on that duelling
field, Lermontov wounded, dreaming of his past life. The whiff of Czarist
sulphur hangs around Lermontov's death, but without conspiracy. It amounted
to suicide at arm's length, boredom of life ended with a little help from
his friends.
Lermontov's 27 years in Moscow and the Caucasus were, like the lives of
English counterparts Byron and Keats, a Romantic way of death. He wrote
poetry, but achieved fame for creating Russia's Byronic man Perchorin, A
Hero of Our Time in his only novel, written in 1840. The message: 'We
survive on novelty, so much less demanding than commitment.'
This play has Lermontov haunted by his own creations, controlling and
controlled by them. Like the novel, Lermontov's Dream presents a Byronic
journey of easy oaths and easier women; it knows that happiness looks boring
and virtue unappealing. Lermontov becomes the ego and the id of Perchorin,
sharing his creation's lines by entering the pattern of lies and shocks
modeled on Perchorin's misdeeds.
In Lermontov's world, all is blank hypocrisy, passion a shallow concern, and
social rules only for those who care. The characters put the hard questions:
'Lermontov, why have I never been a slave to the women I have loved?'
Learning about the world he has created, Lermontov faces himself.
In keeping with Lermontov's writing, the play avoids intimacy with the
characters. One of Perchorin's lovers, Vera, declares, 'I go from guilt to
ecstasy in a single moment; it's madness' but she never shows it happening.
The wrecking of wreckable lives and the universal duplicity of feeling
throughout are told rather than shown.
The play needs more space, more brooding, and less freneticism. However,
this makes bold, inventive theatre, with a narrative that drives the action
forward. A simple black and red set, black cossack costumes for the men and
wispy chiffon for the women create a visual unity. The acting of Harry
Meacher (who co-directs with Kit Gerould) and David Middleton as Lermontov
and Perchorin is a swift, sure interchange; elsewhere, Paul Arlington, Gail
Macfarlane and Judi Bowker are convincing as doctor, society woman and
lover.
Lermontov's Dream succeeds in conveying the bleak vision that made him a
pattern for Chekhov's Solyony (The Three Sisters). He had written in 1838:
'Knowing too much, lost in equivocation, our generation is growing old in
idleness.' How could he bear to live longer?

In happier times Norman Lamont would have loved nothing better than
returning to his old university union to debate the follies of the Labour

tonight's Cambridge Union debate.
Perhaps he was worried that he might lose. Whatever the reason, the Treasury
team is missing the urbane communications skills of former ministers,
Francis Maude and John Maples, who lost their seats in the last election.
Indeed, Observer hears that Maples - now working for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi  -
was even in the running at one stage to head Lloyd's of London, the
venerable insurance market whose current problems seem almost as intractable
as the government's own. After careful consideration, Maples decided against
entering that particular race. Could it be that he wanted to avoid a
commitment that might prevent him running in an early by-election?

Is Morgan Grenfell's John Craven about to be joined by another foreigner on

leaving Milan to take a 'senior management' post at BAI's parent Deutsche

Osculati, the former head of McKinsey's European banking practice, who was
hired to run BAI just before its sale to the Germans, has made a success of
the company, almost doubling profits in the past four years.
But the affable Osculati, 45, may have to wait a while. Like Craven he is
hardly fluent in German, and a slot on the bank's current 13 member board is
not likely to become vacant until the end of next year, when Horst Burgard
is expected to retire.

America might be getting a new president, but in one sense its priorities
remain unchanged. Candidate debates are taking a second place to this year's
baseball play-offs.
The first debate on Sunday was timed to be sandwiched between two games. As
it happened, the first ran into an extra innings (overtime to the
uninitiated), which meant that CBS never switched to the candidates at all.
The vice presidential hand-to-hand combat was also broadcast early for the
same reason.
Last night's set-to was entirely dependent on the men in pinstriped pyjamas.
If Oakland had beaten Toronto on Wednesday, forcing a deciding game last
night, then the debate would have been early again. But as Toronto were the
conquerors, it could go on in prime time.
But here's the curiosity. Sunday's TV ratings for what was a very exciting
baseball game were awful compared with the debates, not entirely explicable
by the fact that one of the teams is from Canada.
Maybe America really does prefer blood sports.

Lords Hanson and White, Sir Ralph Halpern, Richard Branson and dozens of
other business leaders can breathe a little more easily. They have not won
this year's most embarrassing business award for Britain's Most Romantic Top
Tycoon.
Mills &amp; Boon, which publishes 15m copies of its bodice-ripping yarns a year,
has conducted a nationwide search for Big Business's 'Mr Right' over the
past six months. It contacted the personal assistants of 140 top business
people and 17 replied, which sounds rather a lot.
Apart from saying that the 'winning nominee has a lifestyle that will make
most women swoon', Mills &amp; Boon's lips are sealed until the week after next.
The only clue is that when not playing with his private helicopter and jet,
the winner still finds time to cook candle-lit dinners for his 21-year-old
girlfriend. This sounds rather like Richard Gabriel, 37, the
multi-millionaire founder of parcel firm Interlink Express.
However, a word of warning to the winner. When Mills &amp; Boon last grabbed the
headlines by picking Britain's Most Romantic MP, within three years the
winner had separated from his wife and lost his seat in parliament.

Sir, As the grand-daughter of a Northumbrian miner, I watched the painful
transformation of a resilient and proud community. Long ago, I crept south
to run a service sector company.
In the past, it was possible (though not easy) to adapt. Now, what prospects
do 30,000 grief-stricken miners have?
The industrial loss will compound this country's infrastructure deficit.
There is scant evidence to suggest that any government takes a sufficiently
impartial and long-term view of the country's needs and hopes, to create the
basis for sustainable economic and social health.
We should have a published, national five year rolling plan which could
accommodate free market principles without allowing a political
free-for-all.
An abiding aspect of the miners' tragedy may be that the shaky road behind
is clear; yet the road ahead is not built, and who dare be confident that
the supposed economics of this decision are not another blind alley?

There was a call for a balanced investment programme with a continuing major
contribution from coal to ensure gas is not misused. There was also a widely
held belief that the costs of gas generation would not be lower in a
genuinely free market.
Before committing us to the decimation of the coal industry, the government
should listen to people who operate in the real world, who actually take
decisions and whose motivation is common sense, efficiency and concern for
the environment.

Sir, Michael Heseltine said on the Today radio programme (October 15) that
one of the reasons for buying gas and converting the power stations is that
it would be cheaper for the consumer. The electricity industry, like other
businessmen, had to go out and buy the cheapest option.
Has nobody ever told him, 'Cheap is dear'?
I would have preferred to have paid a little more for my electricity than
see the coal industry die, the resultant unemployment and inevitable
consequences.

<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Heseltine was reported as saying that 'British Coal cannot go on
producing coal that cannot be sold' and that the closure of 31 pits and the
redundancy of 30,000 miners was the painful but inevitable result. Even
before considering the knock-on effects of such economic devastation the
government's judgment in terms of business sense is lacking.
Instead of developing an economic framework and infrastructure that gives
some support during the recession to this national industrial asset, the
government has exacerbated the situation by allowing the short-term, narrow
interests of the power generators and suppliers to determine energy policy.
By privatising the electricity generating and supply industries, the
government gave the green light to the 'dash for gas'. Now it argues that
the demise of 'King Coal' was caused by market forces: these inanimate
processes that mere mortals, such as government ministers, cannot alter and
tamper with at their peril.
All this, of course, is ideological nonsense. Other countries - Germany,
France, Japan for instance - have market economies, but ones in which the
state is prepared to intervene to influence corporate investments, to
protect or induce industrial sectors considered essential to national
economic health. The British government kowtows to only one of many versions
of the market economy, and the one which recent history has shown to be the
least capable of delivering high productivity-high wage, prosperous
economies.

Sir, Everyone seems agreed that a major cause of the persistence of the
current recession is that so many people engaged in herd-like
over-investment in property. We now learn that most of our coal industry is
to be closed because 43 natural gas power stations are being built, or have
been proposed. I wonder whether there is any similarity between these
phenomena?

<TEXT>
Sir, The present government seems determined to prove that it is the most
committed of economic purists and to offer up whole chunks of British
industry on the altar of a 'free market' which, as we all know, is in no way
at all as free as they would like us to believe.
The decision to close so many productive coal mines can be seen as a form of
economic madness which no amount of waffling about 'the costs of production'
by Michael Heseltine can disguise. At a time when good quality coal is hard
to come by (ignoring the brown coal which floods in from eastern Europe) we
seem prepared to increase our reliance upon coal imports and to accept the
idiocy of burning vastly increasing quantities of gas - a valuable feedstock
for many other chemical and pharmaceutical products.
The decision by past governments not to invest heavily (as the Germans have
done) in de-sulphurising scrubbers for our coal-fired power stations helps,
of course, the present case against coal - and for gas  - in that the
discharge of pollutants exceeds the permitted European levels. That the
Germans are now probably world leaders in the manufacture and sale of such
equipment, and that many thousands of jobs were created by the German
government's decision to invest in this area shows what an enlightened and
pragmatic approach to problem solving can turn up.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial comments ('Coal takes the unkindest cut', October 14)
properly set out the powerful economic arguments in favour of maintaining a
strong domestic coal industry, and lay the blame for the present crisis
where it really belongs. The previous government privatised the electricity
industry in a way which creates a rigged market and permits the power
generators to build gas-fired power stations to produce more expensive
electricity than existing coal-fired stations and then pass on the extra
costs to electricity consumers. At the same time nuclear power is subsidised
by every electricity consumer having 11 per cent added to his bill.
This government is forever preaching about subjecting the energy industry to
market forces. Let no one doubt that my members have no fear of market
forces; what they demand is a level playing field so that the lowest cost
fuel available for electricity generation - coal produced in Britain - gets
its rightful share of the market.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Personal View: Russia on the brink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY SACHS and DAVID LIPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's economic reforms are falling prey to confusion, communist
counterattack, and neglect from the west.
The reformers, led by the acting prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, have
achieved great successes in launching a radical privatisation programme,
freeing prices, opening the economy and undertaking fundamental legal
reforms. But these achievements are on the verge of being swept aside by
hyperinflation. Although data are sketchy, inflation now looks to be around
30 per cent a month and rising. Still worse, the policy responses to this
threat have been mostly confused or harmful.
The urgent need is to staunch the haemorrhaging of rouble credits from the
Russian Central Bank to enterprises and the budget. But aside from the small
number of reformers in the cabinet, few Russian political leaders understand
or acknowledge the monetary aspects of the explosive inflation. Many hold
that further credits will stimulate production and thereby reduce prices,
the same fantasy that once gripped Latin America.
Many politicians and bureaucrats believe that a return to price controls,
artificial exchange rates and state orders are the real solution to
inflation.
The deep economic problem is the same as it has been for many years. Russia
and many of the other new eastern European and former Soviet states are
still bankrupting themselves by directing resources - now, via cheap credits
 -to the oversized military-industrial complex and associated civilian heavy
industries. It is mind-boggling, for example, that steel production in the
Soviet Union was 80 per cent higher than in the US, even though its economy
was less than one-eighth the size. Of course, there is no conceivable reason
to produce so much steel but it is viewed as a calamity when the steel
factories reduce their output in the face of limited demand.
Much of the political elite in Russia remains mesmerised by heavy industrial
capacity, and this clouds understanding of Russia's predicament. Almost no
one speaks the simple truth that Russia's capacity in heavy industry was
built by starving the society of shops, medical facilities, consumer
industries, housing construction and banks. Preserving the old structures
not only risks financial catastrophe, but promotes continuing neglect of
Russia's real and urgent needs elsewhere in the economy.
Poland's reforms provide some lessons for Russia. With the start of market
reforms in 1990, the Polish government maintained macroeconomic discipline
in the face of a 35 per cent decline in industrial production (much more
than has occurred in Russia). Workers and resources that had been in heavy
industry helped build other sectors of the economy, especially services and
consumer industries.
As a result, Poland's private sector has grown by 710,000 small businesses
and 50,000 corporations since the end of 1989. More than 2m people (about 15
per cent of non-agricultural employment) have joined the private sector,
which now accounts for more than half of GDP and which continues to grow
rapidly.
Contrary to the fears that were expressed in Poland in 1990, and that
paralyse Russia today, Poland's consumers have benefited enormously by the
changes. Shortages, queues and hyperinflation are gone. Ownership of
consumer goods such as television sets, videos and cars has soared. Economic
life is becoming normal.
In Russia, the military-industrial complex has bitterly resisted the decline
in production. After a fall in production of around 15 per cent at the start
of this year, the military and industrialists demanded, and received, large
flows of cheap credits to pay workers and buy inputs to try to maintain
production. It was widely accepted that the 'industrial recession' must end.
The money supply has approximately doubled since July 1, when the floodgates
of credit were opened. The credits allowed the enterprises to produce, but
did not generate customers for the output. Inventories have swelled and
enterprises have continued to cut their output. More and more, the credits
find their way directly into higher wages and into the foreign exchange
market, where the value of the rouble has been collapsing.
It is hard to judge how much is power politics and how much is confusion in
Russia's disastrous monetary policies. Surely, the lobbying pressures of the
industrialists play a role. The main 'centrist' leader, Mr Arkady Volsky,
headed industry under former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and his
goal is to preserve the old industrial structures. Many other politicians,
such as Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg, defend the
military-industrial complex because their constituencies depend heavily on
military production. In Ukraine, the head of the largest nuclear missile
plant became prime minister this week.
But the role of confusion should not be underestimated.
President Yeltsin stands to lose all by hyperinflation, and yet he is
promoting Gorbachev-style 'compromises' with the military-industrial complex
which will bring financial disaster. The swirl of advice around Yeltsin is
thick with old dogmas: that industrial decline is destroying Russia; that
unemployment is too high a social cost (despite an unemployment rate that is
less than 1 per cent); and that inflationary subsidies to industry reduce
social burdens.
The situation is desperate, but not hopeless. The Russian people generally
support the reforms, though their support has been squandered by
irresponsible macroeconomic policies. Yeltsin can still reverse his drift
back to the hardliners, by recognising the peril of his present course. The
west, too, could awaken from its reckless disregard of events in Russia, and
weigh in on the side of macroeconomic stabilisation.
At the start of this year, when the reformers had momentum, the west was
nowhere to be found. US President George Bush virtually abandoned the
international scene altogether, in pursuit of re-election. Japan's role has
been even more irresponsible, as it put the return of four tiny islands from
Russia above other considerations. And while western Europe did more, its
commitment has still been shockingly slight, given the risks of disaster on
its own borders.
The International Monetary Fund, sent by the west to co-ordinate its
assistance, has had not a single monetary expert in residence in Moscow, and
the sporadic IMF visits have just scratched the surface. The Dollars 24bn
aid package promised by the west has remained undefined and unfulfilled.
The limited flows coming to Russia, mostly from export credit agencies, have
been one or two-year loans that are not linked to reform. Even the debt has
not been rescheduled.
There can be no illusions: Russia's transformation to a democratic
market-based society will require years of change, including constitutional
reforms, new elections, privatisation, and so on. There will be deep
frustrations as well as achievements. But the process could soon turn from
orderly change to dangerous chaos if there is hyperinflation.
Yeltsin and his reform government still have the chance to steer their
country away from the brink of disaster. The west can help them at this
pivotal moment. The need for greater financial support, technical assistance
and debt relief is clear. The world's leaders, especially the next US
president and Russia's neighbours must recognise the urgency of the task.

FT  16 OCT 92 / High stakes but low hopes: Today's summit is unlikely to
break the Maastricht impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only one thing is certain about today's European summit at Birmingham: it
will not solve the problems hanging over the future of the Maastricht
treaty. The 12 European leaders will all declare their unanimous commitment
to Maastricht. But there is clearly a danger that this public relations
exercise, which is intended to help assuage the widespread popular mood of
scepticism towards the treaty, will in fact backfire, and instead persuade
the public that the treaty and perhaps the Community are irrelevant to the
deepening recession in Europe.
British diplomats say they are optimistic that the European leaders should
have no great difficulty in drafting a declaration on the elusive new
European principle of 'subsidiarity', which is supposed to reassure the
voters that the treaty will not take the European Community rushing in the
direction of a centralised federal state.
'I see no great difficulty,' says one senior British diplomat. 'All we need
are criteria and procedures for filtering new European legislation which
goes too far in the direction of centralised interference, as well as
criteria and procedures for repealing old legislation which went too far.'
Such confidence seems overdone. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, finds the problem so perplexing that he has offered a reward to
anyone who can define subsidiarity on one side of a sheet of paper. The
German government has circulated a memorandum on the subject which runs to
10 pages and is totally incomprehensible, at least in its English
translation. But even if British optimism on this particular issue should
turn out to be justified, it is already clear that the Danish government
will need much more than a declaration on subsidiarity, however lucid,
before it can submit the Maastricht treaty to a new referendum. And unless
the Danes can reverse their No vote of last June, the treaty as it stands
cannot come into force.
No one knows what would be needed to persuade Danish voters to change their
minds, and the Danish government has yet to formulate its requirements. But
the signals from Danish political parties indicate that they will be looking
for changes of substance in such areas as economic and monetary union (Emu),
defence and social policy, which would allow them to opt out of commitments
accepted by the others. Moreover, these changes would have to go well beyond
informal gentlemen's agreements, and be legally enforceable.
There lies the rub. The Danish prime minister said yesterday that special
arrangements could be made for Denmark without changing the treaty. But if
these arrangements are legally enforceable, they must be a substantive
change to the treaty itself. Since this would amount to a renegotiation of
the treaty, all the member governments would be compelled to start their
national ratification procedures all over again.
That could spell the death of Maastricht. It was only by the narrowest of
margins that the French electorate voted in favour of it last month, and
there could be no assurance that they would vote the same way again. French
officials and pro-European commentators freely admit that there are aspects
of the treaty which are open to criticism; but the last thing they want is
to open the Pandora's Box of a renegotiation. 'The treaty framework for Emu
is much too rigid,' says a senior French diplomat; 'to pretend to set up a
system which would make the movement towards monetary union unstoppable is
just puerile. But the immediate task is a salvage operation.'
The main threat to the survival of Maastricht does not come directly from
the Danish No vote, however, but from the possible knock-on in Britain. As a
matter of principle all member governments are firmly opposed to any
renegotiation. As a matter of practice, they would no doubt be prepared to
make some declaratory concessions to Denmark. But, in the last resort, they
are unlikely to be ready to jeopardise the whole treaty just to appease the
Danes. If the Danes are unable to reverse their No vote, the Community is in
a quandary with no easy solution. One option, clearly allowed for in the
Danish government's White Paper, would be for Denmark to leave the
Community.
If that were to happen, it would constitute a seismic reversal of the
process of European integration, and a traumatic blow to the European
Community. But in the case of British ratification, the stakes are even
higher. A refusal by the House of Commons to ratify Maastricht would not
merely kill the treaty, but would have far-reaching consequences for the
general trend of European integration which are impossible to predict in
detail but hard to overstate.
That is why the Danish conundrum is potentially triply dangerous. The first
danger is that Danish demands could trigger a chain reaction of similar
demands in other countries, starting with Britain, for the same or different
opt-outs. This could mean a progressive unravelling of the treaty, and
perhaps its eventual abandonment.
Second, even if such general unravelling were avoided, the British
government could find that ratification in Westminster might start to become
conditional on securing analogous treaty changes for Britain. As of now, it
may be able to intimidate the waverers with a stark choice between Yes and
No, in or out; but the argument could become more difficult if there seemed
to be a three-way choice, between Yes, No and Danish.
Third, the Danish government's drawn-out timetable, which envisages a new
referendum next summer at the earliest, could delay the ratification process
in the House of Commons. The official British line is that the UK government
only needs a clear signal from the Danish government, on its proposed
solution to the Danish problem, to be able to press rapidly ahead with
ratification towards the end of this year. The undertow of political
reality, however, is likely to force a certain coincidence between the
British and Danish timetables. That suggests that the future of Maastricht
could still be up in the air nine months from now.
It is not at all clear that the other member states are ready to wait that
long. Last month there was speculation that an inner core of member states,
starting with France, Germany and the Benelux countries, might start to move
towards monetary union without waiting for Britain or the complete
ratification of the treaty. These rumours were immediately denied and they
are still being denied: 'There is no plan for a two-speed Europe,' a senior
German diplomat said this week. 'The Maastricht treaty must be ratified by
all 12.'
Strictly speaking, these denials are true in at least three senses: there is
no agreed two-speed plan, as such, even of a contingency character; the
French, at least, are very uncertain that they want to find themselves in a
mini-Europe with the Germans; and the French and Germans both want to stifle
any talk which could make John Major's domestic predicament more difficult,
by suggesting that 'the Continent' is ganging up on Britain.
'We have a very simple idea,' says a top French official. 'We want
Maastricht to be ratified as soon as possible. We have no new initiative to
take. We want to help Mr Major as far as we can.'
When Mr Delors floated the idea of a two-speed Europe, he caused anger in
the French government. 'It looked as though Delors was trying to blackmail
the British,' says Mr Serge July, editor of Liberation, the French daily.
'The people at the Elysee thought this was stupid, because they want to help
Major, and they were wild with rage.'
There is no reason to doubt French sincerity on this point, since they have
always been committed to a universalist idea of the Community. Throughout
the negotiations on the treaty, they stuck to the view that all member
states ought to be aiming to reach the final stage of monetary union,
including such unlikely candidates as Italy. This was partly for the
semi-sentimental reason that Italy was one of the original six member
states. But closer to home is the deep conviction that the wider Community
is the essential counterpart of the Franco-German relationship.
Ever since De Gaulle and Adenauer, Franco-German friendship has been a
cardinal component in the foreign policy of both countries. For France, in
particular, it has been the vehicle of reconciliation after three
cataclysmic wars. As a result, their partnership has become the central
motor in the development of the Community, especially in the past decade.
The Maastricht treaty is primarily the result of a sequence of joint
initiatives repeatedly taken by President Francios Mitterrand of France and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. The Community serves the interests of all
its members; it also helps to resolve the painful political conflicts
inherited by France and Germany, but that heritage would be much more
difficult to handle without the Community.
Talk of a two-speed Europe has brought these doubts to the surface in both
capitals. 'It is useful that France and Germany stick together now,' says a
senior German diplomat. 'But in the medium term there will be various
alliances in the Community, and there should not be too much emphasis on the
Franco-German axis. I cannot imagine the EC going on without Britain.'
His view is echoed by Mr Karsten Voigt, foreign affairs spokesman for SPD,
the German opposition party. 'The Franco-German relationship is still a
necessary motor. But France alone is no longer strong enough to bind us.
There is no longer a balance with France.'
The French still believe in the partnership as the traditional motor of the
Community. But they fear German domination in a mini-Europe of five or six
countries, and they certainly do not want to be left alone in an
uncomfortable tete-a-tete with Germany. Moreover, there is emerging in Paris
a new tendency to see the Community in more political and inter-governmental
terms, in which the tone would be set by the triple relationship between
France, Germany and Britain. 'Our conception of Europe,' says a senior
Elysee official, 'is that France, Germany and Britain are fairly close.'
But the desire of France and Germany to help Mr Major is not unlimited, and
it will not last for ever. It will not extend to changing the treaty, and it
may not last much beyond next spring. Neither France nor Germany wants to
forge a mini-Europe; but neither is likely to be prepared to leave Europe in
limbo. Mr Mitterrand is an elderly man in uncertain health, and his
Socialist party is expected to suffer a heavy defeat in the general
elections next March. That may well be the deadline for Mr Major to show
that he can and will ratify the treaty as it stands.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Slip sliding away
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH economy is like a battered car on a steepening descent. Mr
Norman Lamont, and his weary Treasury co-drivers, seem unable to appreciate
how fast it is accelerating away from them. Even if they could catch up with
reality, there is no indication that they have any idea how to stop the
slide. But stop it they must. The longer this continues, the greater the
long-term damage will be.
Yesterday's unemployment figures confirm past pains. The post-election
recovery in spending failed to materialise; manufacturers cannot sell their
stocks either at home or abroad; so manufacturing output has resumed falling
and the rise in unemployment has accelerated.
More disturbing, the recession is now set to intensify over the coming
months. Job vacancies, a reliable lead indicator, stabilised over the
summer. But they have since fallen sharply, by 11 per cent in September
alone. This, and the latest spate of redundancies, ensure that there is much
more bad news to come.
Little wonder, with the economy still deteriorating and real interest rates
still painfully high, that consumer confidence has fallen like a stone.
There are many more bleak months ahead before Britain's consumer recession
will have run its course. The troubles in the banking sector will persist
for longer still, dampening any signs of recovery that do appear.
Yet the government's current drift and indecision are only adding to the
sense of malaise that is gripping the country. It needed to keep its head
while all around - industrialists, trade unionists or back-benchers - were
losing theirs. But it appears increasingly headless.
There is still time for the government to flesh out an alternative economic
strategy, now that sterling has left the exchange rate mechanism. But to do
so it must provide answers to a number of questions that a credible policy
framework must address:
How can the government take advantage of its new freedom outside the ERM and
allow real interest rates to fall without prompting a collapse in the
exchange rate, stoking up inflationary pressures, and eventually repeating
the mistakes that ERM membership was supposed to prevent?
How can it persuade the markets that its finances will be brought under
control, other than through more over-optimistic growth forecasts, without
employing some combination of capital spending cuts, more job losses or tax
increases?
How can it claim that inflation is under control, or indeed controllable
without government intervention, while average earnings in manufacturing are
still rising at more than 6 per cent a year? This means that real earnings
are rising at 2 per cent a year in the midst of a recession, while pay
settlements are twice as high as they need to be if the competitiveness
gains of the devaluation are not to be squandered.
At root, the government must show how it will close the gap between what
Treasury ministers and officials say and what the markets and wage-setters
are prepared to believe. Until these questions are answered satisfactorily,
the malaise will persist.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S EUROPEAN summit was convened by Mr John Major with a dual purpose:
to consider 'shortcomings' in the European monetary system, and to respond
to the concerns shown by electorates about the pace of European integration.
Mr Major was soon dissuaded from tabling serious reform of the ERM, on the
grounds that it might give markets the idea that a currency realignment was
on the agenda. He still intends to have a post-mortem on last month's
crisis, but this will not be 'a detailed operational discussion'; at most it
will come to 'some procedural conclusions'.
The main business, therefore, will be responding to public opinion - clearly
something that needs doing. Even now it is not certain that the EC's leaders
have taken the full measure of the crisis of confidence the Community
confronts. Much of what has been said in the run-up to the summit smacks
more of cosmetic presentation than of a serious rethink.
To some extent that is inevitable. The 12 governments are rightly unwilling
to tear up the Maastricht treaty and start again from scratch. A text agreed
with so much effort cannot now be jettisoned without a great risk of
torpedoing the entire European enterprise. The most important task that
Europe's leaders have at this summit is to prove that they are still united
and determined to move forward together. All are committed to Maastricht,
and if they were now to abandon that commitment they would not soon agree on
anything else to put in its place. The message received by the world would
be that the EC is falling apart.
Therefore the commitment has to be reaffirmed. Those who have ratified must
stand by the judgment of their peoples or parliaments. Those who have not
yet ratified must pledge their best efforts to secure ratification without
further delay. The Danish government must spell out clearly what it thinks
it needs to get the June verdict reversed, and the other 11 must do their
best to supply it.
Major's problem
Whether the Danes can truly conceive a set of sidebars to the Maastricht
treaty which do not require a new ratification process is open to doubt. It
they cannot, their bluff may have to be called. Polls also show a large
majority of Danes strongly attached to the EC as it stands. If invited to
vote again on a text which, this time, has been ratified by all their
partners, and is accompanied by one or more solemn declarations intended to
soothe their main anxieties, they may well prefer to come on board. On the
one hand, the debate in the other member states should have convinced them
that they will not be alone in any future battles against excessive
centralisation; on the other, they would know that by voting No a second
time they run a real risk of the others deciding to go ahead without them.
In other words, the 'Danish problem' is not really a Danish problem. It is
shorthand for a problem of European public opinion in general, and perhaps
British public opinion in particular. Indeed, many of Mr Major's guests in
Birmingham believe that the real purpose of the meeting is to save his
political skin. Luckily for him, they regard that as something worth doing.
He may not be perfect in their eyes, but he has now staked his future on
ratifying Maastricht and they do not want him to fail.
What Mr Major apparently thinks he needs from this summit is an agreed
statement on subsidiarity. Because he thinks he needs it, he will probably
get it, though it is unlikely to take any very detailed form. Whatever
preamble or sidebar is eventually to be tacked on to the treaty for Danish
consumption will not be ready until the regular summit in December. From
Birmingham, a statement of intent will have to do.
Wider malaise
But no one should imagine that such a preamble or sidebar is a sufficient
solution to the widespread malaise which Maastricht has provoked, or
revealed; or that the subsidiarity issue can ever be finally solved; or that
that issue alone constitutes the problem.
Much of the malaise is of economic origin and can only be cured by a renewal
of economic growth. That part of it which relates to the structure and
behaviour of the EC arises only partly from the non-respect of subsidiarity.
It also arises from the lack of clarity and accountability in how the EC
deals even with things which are properly its business.
Subsidiarity can certainly be improved. Mr Jacques Delors, in the paper he
submitted to his colleagues this week, suggested a sensible and carefully
thought-out approach to the problem. Britain, especially, should welcome the
emphasis he gave to the primacy of the internal market. For if this is
neglected, subsidiarity could easily be used to demolish it, as differences
in national regulations would undermine fair competition. But whatever
happens the Community is going to retain significant powers, and it is vital
that those powers be exercised in a democratic manner which citizens can
easily follow. It is simply not acceptable that the legislature enacting
rules for over 300m Europeans should be a cabal of ministers meeting behind
closed doors.
What the EC needs, and what Maastricht fails to provide, is a democratic and
clearly intelligible constitution. Maastricht is still worth ratifying. But
long before they are ready to implement its monetary provisions the leaders
of the new European Union should reconvene to design a coherent set of
institutions. One way to do this would be at a special intergovernmental
conference before 1996, when the next one is due. Alternatively, the task
could be undertaken by an elected constituent assembly, with the results
subject to ratification by referendum in every member state.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Green spirit of America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
The great green hope of the US presidential election is Senator Al Gore. He
is a man of quality, perhaps more so than Governor Bill Clinton, whose
behaviour as president is unpredictable. As vice-president, Mr Gore would
press for strong environmental policies. He is, happily, obsessed with the
subject. He would be at least as much of a positive force in favour of
strategies that protect the planet as Vice-President Dan Quayle is a
negative one.
Those of us who regard the threat of global warming as the most important
political issue since the fall of communism will feel a certain quickening
of the pulse at the prospect of an actively conservationist presidency of
the US. This matters more than the little local question of how Britain came
to be governed by a sorcerer's apprentice and his pals.
The Clinton-Gore manifesto promises US environmental leadership. Whether we
believe its fine words or not, the pair of them can hardly do worse than
President Bush. The chances are that Mr Clinton would put Senator Tim Wirth
in charge of Washington's environmental protection agency. Now retiring from
the senate, Mr Wirth is a Gore ally. He is also working hard on the Clinton
campaign. He could attend earth summits with the support of the new
president, in contrast to the recent fiasco at Rio, where Mr Bush undercut
everything the EPA stands for.
Hold on. For any of this to happen Mr Clinton has to win the election. The
conventional wisdom is that he will, but those of us who observed the
British contest in April will want to see the votes counted before being
certain. Mr Clinton is not wholly impervious to assaults on his integrity.
That is why Mr Bush is fighting dirty. If the Democrats do win, they will be
reminded of their green promises, of which the central one is to 'shatter
the false choice between environmental protection and economic growth by
creating a market-based environmental protection strategy that rewards
conservation and 'green' business practices while penalising polluters.' The
sentiment is unexceptionable, but in the US the opportunities for lobbies to
sabotage the implementation are infinite.
On his showing in the debate with Mr Quayle this week Mr Gore is not an
ideal campaigner for what should be a popular cause. Mr Quayle, of all
people, roughed him up; Mr Gore came across as tight, pre-programmed, a
little priggish. 'Lighten up Al - inhale,' smiled the vice-president,
getting in a reminder that Mr Clinton had once smoked marijuana without
breathing in. As vice-president, Mr Gore would have to develop a quicker
response mechanism to match the sound-bites put out by the despoilers who
deride greens as extremists or, worse, 'fern-feelers'.
If you read Mr Gore's passionate book, Earth in the Balance, you see the
public relations problem. It is a splendid work, but there is an air of
talking to the plants in it. The sub-title, Ecology and the Human Spirit,
says it all. This is not an age in which you can easily speak or write of
spiritual matters. Mr Gore does, at length. Over-industrialisation and the
frenetic pursuit of the fruits of growth at the cost of asset-stripping the
earth are seen as manifestations of human emptiness. The rot set in when
Plato, later followed by Descartes, sold the idea that we are disembodied
intellects, separate from nature, free to exploit it. Mr Gore is mystic in
his affirmation of the opposite view. He assures us that the proportion of
water in our bodies is about the same as the proportion of water on the
earth's surface, while the salt content in our blood is nearly equivalent to
the salt content of the sea.
It is easy to mock, but I am with Gore's analysis all the way. The
civilisation that seems to have narrowly escaped death-raying itself with
nuclear weapons is destroying itself slowly by pumping carbon accumulated
over thousands of years into the air in a few decades, while allowing the
earth's population to quadruple in a single lifetime. The senator makes
short shrift of the tiny minority of scientists who doubt this. He enters
the debate with essays on history (the catastrophes resulting from past,
nature-made climate changes), economics (which avoids issues not related to
increasing output), science, politics and religion. He goes way over the
top, as in comparing contemporary hesitations on green policies with the
1930s prevarications over facing the Nazi challenge. The thrust of his
argument is, however, sound.
Yet in the end he is a compromiser. He is, after all, a politician. Read his
high-flown prose and you will assume that he believes that only 'deep'
greenery, which implicitly denies growth, will ward off global warming. Mr
Clinton is campaigning on a promise to get the US economy moving again. His
environmental trumpet is relatively muted. Mr Gore ducks this contradiction.
With conservation and intelligent investment, he argues, you can get richer
and save the earth. These are weasel-words. But I remain an optimist. There
are green shoots in there somewhere.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Technology: Testing time for fibres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New genetic tests to determine the origins of natural materials, including
fibres, timber and meat, are being developed at the British Textile
Technology Group.
The BTTG tests could have far-reaching implications for activities ranging
from clothes retailing to the control of trade in endangered species.
The research started with the aim of finding a new way to distinguish
between different fibres in clothing materials, which would be faster and
more reliable than traditional examination by microscope. The textile
industry needs such a test to detect the adulteration of expensive animal
fibres like cashmere and mohair with cheaper wools.
BTTG scientists have discovered how to extract the small amounts of DNA
present in processed fibres and then identify the species from which it
comes. They are now developing a kit which will for the first time enable
textile buyers to check quickly and accurately whether a particular fabric
matches its specification.
At the same time BTTG's Manchester and Leeds laboratories are working to
extend genetic testing to a much wider range of natural materials.
One potential application is in the food industry, to test the origin of
meat products. An inspector or buyer could then tell immediately whether a
sausage contained the correct amount of pork, beef or venison  - and had not
been adulterated with kangaroo or horse meat.
BTTG sees the timber trade as another outlet. The genetic test could
distinguish between woods which are difficult to tell apart with
conventional methods.
The technology also has forensic applications which would supplement the
well-known role of human gene tests in rape and murder cases. For example,
DNA analysis of stomach contents might identify a murder victim's last meal.
And a single fibre at the scene of a crime could provide evidence about the
clothing worn by a murderer.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Technology: Digital politics - From Monday BBC Radio's
Westminster studio will lead a broadcasting revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC Radio is taking a big step into the digital age. From Monday, political
news and programmes produced by the BBC's Westminster studio and broadcast
throughout the UK will be recorded, processed and edited digitally, without
the use of magnetic tapes.
The move, which represents the biggest change in radio technology for 40
years, is the first stage in what is likely to be a gradual process of
digitisation of radio broadcasting, and eventually television.
'Broadcasting is about to undergo, on the radio side, one of those
fundamental changes in technology and working practices that happens only a
couple of times in a lifetime,' says Richard Ayre, head of BBC Westminster.
The news studio is the first in Europe to install digital technology.
Currently, radio programmes are compiled with the use of cassette tapes and
quarter-inch magnetic tape - bulky reels about the size of an LP record.
In preparing taped sequences for insertion into programmes, a journalist
listens to the relevant recordings of Parliamentary proceedings while
watching a screen which displays a time code of the hour, minute and second
as the recording progresses.
When he finds the section of the recording he wants to use, he notes the
time code and requests that particular part of the recording from the studio
manager.
The studio manager then physically cuts that section from the rest of the
tape and sticks it on a smaller, individual spool for the journalist to use
in his programme.
After a programme has been pieced together and recorded on to one tape, it
is sent down the telephone line to Broadcasting House in London. There, it
is re-recorded and sent to the BBC's regional broadcasting centres where it
is again re-taped.
This is a time-consuming, laborious process. A long programme can use as
many as 20 clips, each of which must be played at the appropriate time. It
is also an expensive way to produce programmes because tapes, though not
costly themselves, require expensive hardware that needs to be replaced
every 15 years or so.
BBC Westminster spends Pounds 20,000 a year on magnetic tapes. Replacing the
tape recording machines, which are just about reaching the end of their
lifetime, could cost as much as Pounds 100,000.
The new digital audio storage, retrieval and editing system, known as
D-Cart, was developed by ABC, the Australian broadcasting group. The system
consists of a black box the size of a refrigerator which is linked up to
terminals with a screen and keyboard, much like any computer terminal. The
BBC system has two 1.2 gigabyte Winchester hard disk drives capable of
storing 50 hours of audio.
Recordings can be made directly into the system from phone or broadcast
lines, satellite links or conventional tape. The Commons and Lords
proceedings, which will be used in the initial stages, come to BBC
Westminster on direct lines from the chambers.
Because the material is stored in the system on magnetic hard disks rather
than tapes there is no danger of damaging the recordings. Furthermore, the
quality of digital recordings is better than that of analogue tape which can
be marred by sound distortions.
But the greatest advantage of the D-Cart system is immediate and random
access to all the material by up to 30 people at the same time.
The recordings in the system are identified by title and number which appear
on the screen. Journalists can access any recording by placing the cursor on
the title and hitting the play key.
For editing purposes, the track is represented on the screen as a bar along
which an arrow moves as the sound progresses. When a journalist comes to the
particular section of the recording that he needs, he simply marks the
beginning and end of the relevant bit on his screen using edit keys. It is
then his to work with, mixing it with his own voice, music or other effects
in the studio.
'The system is ideal for fast-moving situations,' says John Williams, a
media consultant who is working with BBC Westminster to install the system.
D-Cart costs a minimum of Pounds 70,000 and has a life expectancy of seven
to 10 years, according to BASYS Automation Systems, which markets the system
in Europe.
Despite the high cost of the system, BBC Westminster expects to make
substantial savings through the introduction of D-Cart. It will eliminate
the need for the time- and labour-consuming process of recording and
re-recording on tape as a programme is sent from the studio to Broadcasting
House and from there to regional studios.
The recordings, which will have to be erased from the system after 50 hours,
will initially be backed-up on tape until an archiving system is developed.
Nine studio management posts are being eliminated in the first phase of
installing D-Cart and more are expected to follow during phase two in the
first half of next year.
D-Cart is widely used by the ABC network in Australia. Broadcasting House,
headquarters of BBC Radio, will begin installing D-Cart in November.
Elsewhere, the US ABC radio network in New York, CBC in Toronto and Europe-I
in France plan to install the system in next few months.
Digital editing systems are already used for producing some music programmes
but BBC Westminster will be the first in Europe to use it for news
programmes. The BBC uses a similar digital editing system for video, but
this is not yet up to broadcasting standards and does not provide multi-user
access.
Digital recording and editing forms one link in a three-way chain of future
digital audio broadcasting. Already, transmission of programmes from
Broadcasting House to regional transmitters throughout the country is
digitised.
To complete the chain, transmission from radio studios to Broadcasting
House, and from the regional transmitters throughout the UK to individual
receivers will have to be digitised. When that happens, CD-quality music and
sound will be available on radio, marking another fundamental change in
radio broadcasting.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mountain bike riding can be a painful experience without suspension - both
for rider and machine - and for serious riders suspension is becoming
increasingly important.
Muddy Fox, instigator of the mountain bike boom in the UK, has front or rear
suspension available on various models, but has now gone a stage further
with its Intereactive Suspension design combining front and rear suspension
in one system.
The concept, originated by the British inventor Dave Smart, links suspension
movement of the wheels so that they rise and fall together, relative to the
frame. No matter how the weight distribution changes, the bike always
retains level trim.
The chain tension interacts with the suspension system to ensure that the
force the rider puts into the pedals cannot compress the spring, so the bike
can climb and sprint as fast as any conventional rigid frame. Muddy Fox: UK,

One way to make a big impression in the fiercely competitive industrial
printer market is to hammer a way to success. At least that is the approach
at Swedish-owned Facit, which this week introduced a new printhead
technology to the UK market.
Facit has been selling its nine-pin printhead using the so-called Flexhammer
process for 16 years, but has now launched a 24-pin printhead. The tungsten
carbide-tipped hammers are held back from the paper electronically, but
spring forward when the current is stopped to hit the paper.
The new printhead can produce up to seven copies, and is designed to last
for more than 1.5bn characters. The heavy printer in which it is fitted is
aimed at applications such as invoicing where high-quality flexible
printing, along with economic performance, is essential. Facit: UK, 0634

A new liquid spray technology which enables droplets to be produced in a
uniform size has been invented by Cambridge Consultants (CCL), the UK design
and development group.
Conventional liquid spraying technology produces droplets of varying size
over a wide range, but uniform droplets offer potential benefits to a
variety of users.
In agricultural spraying, for example, a more regular drop size maximises
the amount of insecticide, fungicide or herbicide reaching the plants. The
drops will not be so small that they are blown away or so large that they
fall straight to the ground.
And in vehicle fuel injectors, a more uniform spray offers cleaner and more
predictable combustion, says CCL, while controlled drop size in fire-
fighting could reduce the amount of water needed. Cambridge Consultants: UK,

Engineers in manufacturing typically spend around 40 per cent of their time
looking for information - everything from Cad drawings to memos - but when
they find it they often have no way of knowing if they have the latest
version.
Now Computervision has launched a product called VirtualStation which aims
to solve the problem. This allows users to manipulate and review information
spread across multiple systems, sites and storage media from a single
workstation.
The accumulated information of the organisation is available at the click of
a mouse, says Computervision, where previously the user may have needed a
workstation, a PC and, perhaps, an Apple Mac to access all the information.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (7): Soil appeal wanes - Down on the farm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE LEAFY driveway beside the farmhouse, two-year-old Brook Wannop is
clambering into his toddler-sized plastic tractor.
Nearby, a contented tup, resting after a blissful month in a field with 500
ewes, is nonchalantly nibbling the grass.
The cows are mooing, the limpid sun dapples the autumn leaves; it is the
sort of scene that makes city dwellers long for the good life.
But Brook's father Alistair, the National Farmers' Union Cumbria county
chairman and the third generation of Wannops to farm this land near
Carlisle, hopes his son will study for a profession, if only as a second
string to his bow.
Throughout Cumbria, a county where farms are typically small and family-run,
the tradition of sons following fathers into agriculture is weakening, he
says.
'I'm about the last generation which has really gone into it in a big way,'
says 30-year-old Mr Wannop. He has no personal complaint about his choice;
dairy farms such as his are by far the most buoyant sector of Cumbria's
agricultural economy.
Even so, his farm's 5 per cent return on capital employed is not sparkling,
given the effort and constant commitment involved in running a 900-acre farm
with 280 cows. And for many Cumbrian farmers, running lowland livestock
holdings or upland hill farms, earnings are meagre and prospects poor.
'The dairy farmer in the county has high overheads but a high return; the
hill man has a low return but lower overheads,' explains Mr Wannop. 'The
lowland livestock farmer tends to get the worst of both worlds; he has
relatively low income but high overheads.'
Cumbrian agriculture is dominated by dairying, beef and sheep; in 1990 it
had 6,382 holdings providing direct employment for 14,600, nearly 4,000 of
whom were spouses or other family members.
According to Cumbria county council, net farm income in the county's less
favoured area - virtually all its upland - averages only around Pounds
10,000 annually and is expected to fall further in real terms in the 1990s.
In 1989/90, some livestock farmers depended on grants and subsidies for up
to 95 per cent of their income.
During the 1980s, Cumbria's agricultural employment dropped by nearly 900,
yet this has not triggered a large exodus from the land. Instead Cumbrian
farmers seem to have resorted to cost-cutting and ingenuity.
During the decade, the number of full-time hired workers dropped by 34 per
cent; numbers of full-time farmers dropped by 11 per cent but the proportion
of part-time farmers rose by 22 per cent. Even before the government started
urging diversification, Cumbrian farmers had begun exploring its potential,
often by hiring out themselves and their machinery on a contract basis.
Mr Wannop believes more than half the county's farmers rely on income from
diversification, ranging from bed and breakfast to wind farms.
Still, times are tough. 'Many are borrowing deeper and deeper from the
banks, selling off the odd asset, doing more outside work,' he says. 'I
don't think there's any fat to be cut in the agricultural industry.'
According to Rural Development Commission projections, Cumbria's
agricultural sector is expected to lose 1,360 full-time jobs in the 1990s;
indirect job losses are likely to double this figure to 2,720.
The implications for Cumbria's farming communities are clearly grim and the
county is trying to attract European Commission funding.
The impact of job losses on this scale should excite concern, too, among the
millions of visitors from Britain and overseas who each year pour into the
county, and especially the Lake District, to admire the scenery which
farming has helped create.
Lakeland farmers' hopes were raised last autumn by the government's
announcement that it was considering declaring the Lake District an
environmentally sensitive area. The proposal promised financial support for
farmers carrying out environmentally-friendly work, such as drystone
walling, and following less intensive methods.
But now it is rumoured that tight constraints on the latest public spending
negotiations may cause ESA status to be shelved. 'If it's abandoned it will
be a tragedy not only for those farmers and their families but also for the
Lake District landscape itself and the 20 million people who visit every
year,' says Mr Wannop.
On this matter, tourists and farmers have common cause, but, even though
tourism has provided a valuable means of diversification for farming
families, it has also imposed strains on the rural fabric, including its
housing stock.
In the Lake District national park, where strict planning controls inhibit
new building, demand for holiday homes, second homes and retirement
properties has priced many modestly-paid locals out of the market.
A recent survey by the RDC and South Lakeland District Council revealed that
nine out of 10 people on the council's housing list could not afford to buy
a home locally. Fewer than 10 per cent had an annual income of Pounds
16,000, yet in South Lakeland a three-bedroomed semi in need of
modernisation could be marketed for Pounds 135,000, said the report. Rents,
too, were affected by tourism.
A contraction of general shopping facilities, in favour of tourist-related
enterprises, was also recorded in a survey last year by Voluntary Action
Cumbria. And like many rural communities, Cumbria's countrydwellers are also
tussling with problems of scant public transport, and of maintaining vital
rural facilities like local schools and village halls.
This, though, is only part of the story. For many Cumbrians, farming exerts
a pull which goes far beyond economics. Young Brook Wannop may yet, in 20 or
so years' time, be climbing into his own, fullsize tractor.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (6): Cheap costs, high living - Carlisle, the
Cumbrian capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLISLE, THE county headquarters of Cumbria, was an important staging post
for the Romans and the Normans, and then a strategic pawn in the wars
between Scotland and England before Edward I finally won it back for England
in the 13th century. It was from Market Cross, which still stands in the
city centre, that Bonnie Prince Charlie proclaimed his father King of
England in 1745.
Despite its pivotal and turbulent history, its geographical position has
told against it in recent times. It sits in the middle of a sparsely
populated hinterland and roads of varying quality put it a long way in terms
of time from Barrow, Cumbria's second largest urban concentration.
In the past decade, however, Carlisle has flourished and grown as a regional
centre. During the 1980s there was a small but steady increase in population
to the present 107,000. A population of 500,000 lies within 60 minutes
driving.
Throughout the 1980s unemployment ran below the national average and at 8
per cent currently, remains so. In 1989 Henley Centre for Forecasting
predicted growth in the 1990s, although recession will not have helped the
city achieve it.
Mr Roger Bodden spokesman for the Carlisle City Council says: 'Carlisle
comes as a surprise to many visiting businessmen. They arrive expecting to
find the mythical north, a land of industrial decay, an unemployment
blackspot with all the attendant problems. What they find is a buoyant
economy in an attractive historic city.'
The reasons are twofold. First, there is a diversity of manufacturing which
has largely survived the two recessions of the past decade, albeit
contracting in some cases. Second, Carlisle has developed service
industries, particularly retailing and tourism.
The two largest private sector companies are in food processing. Cavaghan
and Gray is best known for supplying quiche and recipe dishes to Marks and
Spencer. United Biscuits Carlisle palnt is famous for Carr's water biscuits
among other things.
Cavaghan and Gray has reduced the numbers it employs to around 1,700, but Mr
Howard Sims, the chief executive, says this is because of productivity
gains. Other large employers include Pirelli and CMB Promotional Packaging,
formerly Metal Box.
There is also Eddie Stobart, a large private distribution company. These
companies provide a diverse, reasonably safe, employment base in
manufacturing. Employment in manufacturing is just below 24 per cent of the
workforce, about the national average.
The service sector has seen most employment growth. The city council has
promoted retailing, supporting development of the Lanes shopping precinct in
1985 and the refurbishment of the Victorian covered market in 1991. The
sector now employs 10 per cent of the workforce.
By 1990 Carlisle had just under 2m sq ft of retailing space, much of it
built in the late 1970s and 1980s. Of this, nearly 900,000 sq ft is devoted
to consumer durables and 509,000 sq ft to convenience goods.
The amount devoted to consumer goods is significant, since shoppers would
otherwise have to go to Newcastle. As a retail centre for Cumbria and the
Scottish borders, Carlisle benefits from the M6 extension nearly into the
city in the 1970s. It also helps that people generally in the region have
lower mortgage commitments than in the south of England?
A city council survey found Carlisle the 20th cheapest place in which to
live of 110 UK towns. It also found that an average Cumbrian family can
maintain the same standard of living for less than two thirds of the cost of
living in the south-east.
Tourism has also grown quickly. Carlisle estimates that between 1987 and
1989 jobs in the tourism industry increased by 80 per cent and now account
for 9.5 per cent of the workforce.
To encourage growth, the council recently spent Pounds 5m on the Tullie
House Museum, which portrays the turbulent history of the borders region.
The cathedral and the Norman castle are also being promoted. Outside the
city, Hadrian's Wall is nearby and the Lake District is close. The policy
seems to be working: Carlisle's number of visitors has risen from tens of
thousands in the early 1980s to 300,000 a year now, spending about Pounds
30m.
A new development is the establishment by the University of Northumberland,
formerly Newcastle Polytechnic, of a Carlisle campus in the heart of the
historic city. The first 80 students are now arriving and numbers will rise
to 250 next year.
Mr David Beaty of the city planning department expects the campus to bring
all kinds of spin-offs. 'We will have a student population with purchasing
power. Eventually we would hope to keep some graduates in Carlisle,' he
adds.
There are already a number of large solicitors and accountants in the town
and in recent years building societies and banks have established regional
or at least sub-regional offices.
To attract more inward investment, the council has identified 64 acres of
land for industrial use. The perceived peripherality of Carlisle is an
admitted problem and there are worries that there will be no direct rail
link with the channel tunnel.
But these weaknesses are offset by the cheapness of the area, in terms of
wages and the cost of land.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (5): Employment drains away - Small dividend from
peace for Barrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPING WITH unemployment in Barrow-in-Furness is rather like trying to fill
a bath slowly with the plug out. Jobs are draining away at a faster rate
than they can be replaced, and there is little prospect of getting the plug
in for some time.
It was the end of the Cold War that pulled the plug, two years ago. Barrow
is the home of VSEL, Britain's nuclear submarine shipyard. The former
Vickers company, privatised from British Shipbuilders in the mid-1980s,
lived off the threat from the Soviet Bloc.
Once this was removed, the switch in national defence policy from deterrence
to maintenance wiped out much of the demand for VSEL's skills. Britain's
planned fleet of 18 nuclear submarines and 12 powered by diesel-electric
motors was cut to 12 and four respectively.
Of the latter, one was already being built at Barrow, and the other three at
Cammell Laird on Merseyside, a VSEL subsidiary, so these were the end of the
diesel-electric order book. To complete the nuclear fleet, there remained a
need for only four new vessels to carry Trident missiles - and these are all
that is left for Barrow to build now.
The effect has been devastating for the Furness area of Cumbria, where the
local economy is dominated by VSEL. Scott, the tissue papermaker best known
for Andrex toilet rolls, is the second largest private sector employer and
has about 400 people. At peak, two years ago, VSEL employed 14,500.
Even now, with the workforce set to fall to just under 8,000 at Christmas,
VSEL remains a giant - and it still will be when the company has slimmed
down to 5,000 within the next two years.
However, HMS Vanguard, the first of the Trident boats, was rolled out
earlier this year and is due to sail to Scotland for sea trials this month.
The next two submarines - Victorious and Vigilant - are in production at
roughly 18-month intervals behind Vanguard, while parts of the fourth boat,
still unnamed, are in the pre-assembly stage. The total programme will
therefore guarantee the 5,000 jobs only to the end of 1994.
VSEL had hoped to bottom out at about 7,000 jobs. It hoped to diversify
partly by making more land armaments - notably its self-propelled howitzer -
and transferring skills into production of offshore components for the oil
industry. To get a foothold, VSEL bought Seabord Lloyd, a well-head
manufacturer.
The recession, however, has, at best, deferred prospects of breaking into
new markets in a big way. Furness Enterprise, the local regeneration agency,
has had to accept the 5,000-job figure and plan accordingly.
Mr Harry Knowles, the agency's chief executive, says: 'In the past two years
alone we have had an increase of 117 per cent in people out of work. Our
forecast is that 12,000 jobs will be lost in the community over five years.
Unemployment was 4.6 per cent in 1990 and is 8.5 per cent now. It will be
15.4 per cent by the end of 1993 and will rise to 18 per cent in 1994.'
VSEL's impact goes well beyond the immediate casualties. Its workers are
highly paid, not least because 70 per cent of them have professional
qualifications or levels of skill which took years to acquire. They have
long provided Barrow with a strong tax base and exercised considerable local
spending power. Moreover, every one job within the shipyard is thought to
support at least two more outside.
Furness Enterprise, which is sponsored by VSEL, Scott, the Rural Development
Commission, English Estates, the Department of Trade and Industry, Cumbria
Training and Enterprise Council and the district and county local
authorities, has set itself an ambitious target - 5,000 job opportunities
over 10 years.
However, this will still leave the community at least 7,000 jobs short when
compared with 1990. The key to achieving the target, or better, will be to
find advanced industries looking for the highly skilled, adaptable labour on
hand.
Mr Knowles says: 'We need a focused approach to make sure skills for
advanced industries are not lost. We will prevail - provided we get the
right sort of partnership with central government. We don't see this as
government intervening in the market economy, or giving us a crutch. But we
do need full development area status so that we can compete equally with
other areas.'
He would also like to see some sort of agency to help the private sector
shoulder some of the risks associated with diversification from defence
markets - a similar principle to what has been done in docklands or inner
cities through the various forms of the urban programme, or in coal and
steel closure areas.
There, reduction of risk for developers - through government paying for land
assembly and reclamation - has proved a powerful lever of even larger
resources from the private sector.
Mr Knowles thinks something comparable should be done in a
swords-to-ploughshares programme, as has been the case in the US. It would
not just be for giants like VSEL; another local defence contractor is the
family-owned Oxley Developments, an advanced electronic ceramics specialist
employing 250 and turning over about Pounds 10m a year.
Oxley's military technology - which has gone into things like infra-red
night vision lights to stop blacked-out US and UK combat helicopters
crashing into each other in the dark - is transferable to anything using
microwaves, in such fields as telecommunications, satellites, mobile radios
and fibre optics.
Dr Geoff Edwards, the managing director, says the company can more than hold
its own against Japanese competitors from a technical viewpoint, but needs
to scale up its production resources to win a viable share as the world
market develops for electronic ceramics. He needs further funding of Pounds
1m and does not want to increase borrowings or lose independence.
There are also bigger ideas on the horizon for the shipyard. The DTI
sponsors a maritime technology centre which is looking into using new
materials to make cargo ships - learning from the anti-turbulence technology
that makes submarines go faster - or developing giant submarine cargo
vessels which could traverse the oceans on autopilot.
But such things are years off. There are no quick solutions - only quick
problems. The speed of collapse of the defence market could not be remotely
envisaged in 1989.
An evident abundance of goodwill, determination and community spirit means
all sides are facing the problem squarely, but the hiatus between putting
the plug back in the bath and opening the taps wider to fill it quicker is
going to be very uncomfortable.

THE DRUG industry's consistent ability to meet analysts' expectations was
underscored by the third-quarter results of Merck, American Home Products
and Upjohn.
Merck, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, continues to benefit from
its new product line, which helped lift third-quarter net income by 17 per
cent to Dollars 644.5m, or 55 cents a share, from Dollars 552.4m, or 47
cents, last year.
Sales advanced 16 per cent to Dollars 2.46bn from Dollars 2.12bn, and were
led by Vasotec for cardiovascular disease, Mevacor and Zocor, which lower
cholesterol.
Nine-month net income rose 17 per cent to Dollars 1.87bn, or Dollars 1.61,
from Dollars 1.59bn, or Dollars 1.37. Sales were 12 per cent higher at
Dollars 7.06bn, against Dollars 6.29bn.
American Home Products, another large pharmaceuticals group, turned in
third-quarter net income of Dollars 427.7m, up 11 per cent from Dollars
384.9m. Earnings per share were 12 per cent up at Dollars 1.37, against
Dollars 1.22.
Sales grew 12 per cent to Dollars 2.11bn from Dollars 1.86bn, led by a 16
per cent improvement in drug sales to Dollars 1.21bn.
Like Merck, American Home Products' performance has been helped by several
relatively new products.
In contrast, growth at Upjohn has been held back by a lack of major new
products. The company posted third-quarter net income of Dollars 138m, or 77
cents a share, against Dollars 140m, or 77 cents, a year ago.
Sales of Halcion, the sleeping pill banned recently in the UK, fell 47 per
cent in the quarter. Earnings in the latest quarter included after-tax
restructuring charges of Dollars 15m, or 8 cents a share.
Third-quarter sales rose 8 per cent to Dollars 894.4m from Dollars Dollars
831.7m.

AMERICAN Airlines, one the big three US carriers, yesterday announced it
would dismiss hundreds of administrative workers in an attempt to cut
management payroll costs by 10 per cent next year.
American's move is further evidence of the continuing financial pressures on
the US airline industry generally - which has clocked up losses of around
Dollars 7bn during the past two-and-a-half years.
Like its two big competitors, United and Delta, American has already
announced multi-billion dollar cuts in capital spending plans for the next
few years.
American, based in Dallas, said the latest jobs losses came as part of
broader effort to prune Dollars 300m from 1993 expenditures.
It had not determined the precise number of jobs that would disappear, but
calculated that the figure would range between 500 and 1,000.
Although cuts would be made across the system, the airline acknowledged the
bulk of the job losses would occur in the Texas headquarters.
AMR, American's parent, has not yet reported third-quarter results, but it
has warned that it expected a loss.
In the first six months of the year, AMR has lost Dollars 146m after-tax.
Its shares closed up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 58 1/4 yesterday.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN, the New York banking group, yesterday reported a 7 per cent
increase in third-quarter profits to Dollars 400m, thanks to strong
corporate finance fees, net interest income and trading revenues, which
helped offset further losses on mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
The bank would not reveal the scale of the MBS losses, created by high
levels of mortgage refinancings and accelerated prepayments, but they are
believed to have contributed to the 16 per cent decline in Morgan's overall
securities trading revenues to Dollars 313m.
The bank lost Dollars 50m on its MBS business in the first quarter of this
year.
Strong profits from foreign exchange and derivatives trading, however,
helped make up for the MBS losses in the third quarter.
Like many big international banks and securities firms, Morgan earned a lot
of money from exploiting the volatile movements in world interest rates and
currency markets during September.
Corporate finance earnings were especially healthy during the third quarter,
rising 60 per cent to Dollars 123m, primarily because of an increase in
cross-border advisory business, particularly in Latin America.
Net interest income remained the biggest earner for Morgan, rising 14 per
cent in the quarter to Dollars 448m as the bank restructured parts of its
investment portfolio to boost the volume of average interest-earnings
assets.
Sales of certain US and foreign government securities and other investments,
part of the portfolio restructuring, resulted in net gains of Dollars 91m.
Increased activity in the securities lending business lifted credit-related
fees 49 per cent to Dollars 58m, and a rise in assets under management
pushed investment management fees up 21 per cent to Dollars 97m.
Morgan's operating expenses climbed 16 per cent in the quarter to Dollars
754m, a result of higher salary expenses related to increased hiring, higher
compensation payouts linked to the company's performance, and increased
technology and communications costs.
Morgan's figures were well received by the stock market, and the bank's
shares closed up  5/8 at Dollars 61 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.

CBS, the US broadcasting group which owns one of the country's leading

42.7m, a significant recovery when compared with a loss of Dollars 169.1m
suffered in the same period of last year.
The profit, on revenues 7.5 per cent up at Dollars 672.8m, translates into
earnings per share of Dollars 2.76, against a loss of Dollars 11.11 per
share a year ago.
Third-quarter earnings a year ago included a Dollars 195.5m provision
related to broadcasts of professional baseball and football.
CBS, controlled by Mr Larry Tisch, had nine-month net income of Dollars
53.8m, against a loss of Dollars 95.2m in the same period of 1991. Revenues
were Dollars 2.53bn, against to Dollars 2.09bn.

THE SLUGGISH world economy and weak aluminium prices cut Reynolds Metals'
third-quarter earnings in half. Income fell to Dollars 20.8m, or 35 cents a
share, from Dollars 41.5m, or 70 cents, in the same period last year.
For the first nine months of the year, earnings were Dollars 67.2m, or
Dollars 1.13 per share, down sharply from Dollars 130.4m, or Dollars 2.20,
in 1991.
Third-quarter sales rose to Dollars 1.48bn, from Dollars 1.44bn. Nine-month
sales were Dollars 4.31bn, down from Dollars 4.34bn.
'Reynolds' results reflect the continuation of severely depressed aluminium
prices due to the weaker than expected economic recovery and the worldwide
oversupply situation,' said Mr Richard Holder, chairman and chief executive.
Aluminium shipments totalled 388,300 tonnes in the quarter, and 1.115m
tonnes for the first nine months, up from 386,400 and 1.088m tonnes
respectively in 1991.

GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence group, yesterday reported a sharp rise in
third-quarter net earnings, helped by higher profits in its tactical
military aircraft operations, reduced losses in space launch systems and
Dollars 23m of special one-time gains.
The company, which is undergoing a major restructuring, involving the sale
of non-core businesses, reported net earnings of Dollars 120m, up from
Dollars 71m in the same period of last year. Earnings per share soared from
Dollars 1.66 to Dollars 3.77. During the quarter the company cut the number
of shares outstanding by about 30 per cent due to a stock repurchasing
programme.
For the nine months, it reported net earnings of Dollars 641m, compared with
Dollars 339m in 1991.
General Dynamics now groups its earnings into two categories. One covers the
four core businesses it plans to keep and other operations it is selling.
It said continuing operations produced earnings of Dollars 62m on sales of
Dollars 1.7bn, compared with 1991's earnings of Dollars 40m on sales of
Dollars 1.4bn.
Of the four businesses, military aircraft saw earnings rise from Dollars 39m
to Dollars 52m on sales up from Dollars 650m to Dollars 804m; nuclear
submarines produced earnings of Dollars 26m on sales of Dollars 419m, up
from Dollars 24m on sales of Dollars 453m; armoured vehicles earned Dollars
28m, up from Dollars 26m, while sales rose from Dollars 263m to Dollars
275m; and space launch systems cut losses from Dollars 23m to Dollars 11m on
sales which rose from Dollars 63m to Dollars 163m.

FIRST Chicago suffered a loss of Dollars 365.1m, or Dollars 4.65 a share, in
the third quarter, after taking a special charge of Dollars 625m to cover
loan losses and the restructuring of its commercial property portfolio.
The bank said in September it would take the charge as part of a decision to
accelerate the disposal of Dollars 2bn in commercial real estate exposure.
However, analysts said an unexpected additional loan-loss provision of
Dollars 145m lifted the Chicago-based bank's third-quarter loss above most
Wall Street projections.
In the third quarter of 1991, First Chicago had earnings of Dollars 24.6m,
or 19 cents per share.
For the first nine months of this year, the loss was Dollars 15.9m, or 65
cents per share, compared with a profit of Dollars 131.4m or Dollars 1.55
per share.
An accounting change added 10 cents per share to third-quarter earnings, and
Dollars 3.07 per share to year-to-date results.
First Chicago's bond and foreign exchange trading sectors and its credit
card division performed well during the quarter. Trading profits were
Dollars 103.3m, against Dollars 65.7m last year, and credit card revenues
rose to Dollars 138.6m, from Dollars 108m.
However, operating costs continued to escalate, rising to Dollars 473.8m in
the quarter, from Dollars 405.3m a year ago.
Continental Bank reported third-quarter income of Dollars 53m, or 82 cents,
against a loss of Dollars 185m, or Dollars 3.61, a year ago.
The 1991 loss included a Dollars 204m provision for credit losses and
charges for corporate restructuring.
The Chicago-based bank holding company reported earnings of Dollars 161m, or
Dollars 2.50, against a loss of Dollars 123m, or Dollars 2.79 a share, for
the first nine months of 1991.
Continental said third-quarter operating expenses were down 9 per cent from
a year ago, and revenues from loan syndications, structured finance, trading
activities and equity investments increased.

LOTUS Development, the US personal computer software company, reported a 6
per cent decline in third-quarter revenues as it lost ground in the market
for programs that run on PCs using the popular Microsoft Windows program.
A pre-tax gain of Dollars 34.6m from the sale of stock in Sybase, another
software company, brought net income for the quarter to Dollars 30.1m, or 72
cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 21.5m, or 48 cents, in last
year's third-quarter.
Revenue was Dollars 206.7m, down from Dollars 218.8m last year.
Without the gain from the sale of Sybase stock, earnings totalled Dollars
7.3m, or 17 cents.
'Seasonal softness and recessions in key international economies, along with
continued price competition, contributed to the quarter's modest decline in
revenue,' said Mr Ed Gillis, chief financial officer.
'We anticipate that certain of these factors will continue to affect our
business in the near term.'
Large initial shipments in the third quarter of 1991 of 1-2-3 for Windows, a
version of Lotus' spreadsheet program, resulted in negative year-to-year
comparisons, he added.
Competition from Microsoft has significantly reduced Lotus' share of the
spreadsheet market. Lotus has, however achieved a leadership position in the
emerging 'workgroup' computer software market.
'Over the next several quarters, we expect to increase our overall share of
Windows desktops, based on the strength of our offerings across the major
Windows application categories,' Mr Gillis added.
Nine-month net income rose 76 per cent to Dollars 65.8m, or Dollars 1.52 a
share, from Dollars 37.3m or 84 cents. Revenue rose 13 per cent to Dollars
654.1m, from Dollars 579.7m.

<TEXT>
WESTERN German industry expects output to stagnate in 1993, after a 1 per
cent fall this year. Leading companies expect the worst of the downturn to
be over by year-end, according to the Ifo economics institute in Munich.
Meanwhile, the German engineering industry is labouring in depressed
international markets. Many companies, including machine-tool makers, will
record losses this year, Mr Berthold Leidinger, president of the VDMA
industry association, said yesterday.
The average net return on capital had fallen to an all-time low of less than
1.2 per cent. The industry, which has annual turnover of DM250bn (Pounds
100bn), would have to cut costs by up to 30 per cent to remain competitive,
Mr Leidinger added. The 40 per cent appreciation of the D-Mark against the
dollar and a revaluation of 20 per cent against the yen over the past three
years was a heavy burden.
The motor industry has also warned of the need for cost reductions which
could trim 200,000 jobs in coming years. Germany's Lufthansa airline plans
to cut about 400 pilot jobs in 1993, as part of its cost reduction efforts,
Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Lufthansa employs about 3,200 pilots.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Panic claims breakthrough after Kosovo talks

   PRISTINA, YUGOSLAVIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, yesterday claimed he had made a
breakthrough with ethnic Albanian leaders in the Serbian province of Kosovo
after pledging to abolish discriminatory legislation.
'We have to democratise the system ..on the long road towards establishing
democracy in Kosovo, we have made the most important steps,' said Mr Panic
in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, after talks with Mr Ibrahim Rugova, the
leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
'Mr Panic has agreed to lift all discriminatory laws and I am grateful for
that,' said Mr Rugova.
The prime minister's visit followed clashes this week between Serbian riot
police and thousands of Albanians demanding the reopening of Albanian
language schools and universities closed by the Serbian authorities.
If Mr Panic succeeds in brokering a peace between the region's radicalised
Serbs and its Albanians, he will have scored an important victory in his
struggle with Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic.
Kosovo's Serbs, who comprise just 8 per cent of Kosovo's 2.1m population,
mistrust Mr Panic. They revere Mr Milosevic for bringing the province under
direct rule by Belgrade three years ago, when he stripped Kosovo of its
autonomy, dissolved the parliament, and discontinued Albanian language
media.
While Mr Panic has to convince Serbs of his nationalist credentials, he
faces an equal challenge in persuading Albanian political leaders to accept
being part of a country they have renounced. He must prove he can deliver on
his pledge to democratise a province under virtual apartheid.
Albanians have boycotted state education, attending underground schools, and
rejecting curriculum foisted on them by Belgrade.
The threat of war in Kosovo, after the death and destruction in neighbouring
Bosnia, may strengthen Mr Panic's hand. It may steer Serbs and Albanians
into reaching a compromise. Even Kosovo's Serbs, who control the province's
state enterprises, have been hard hit by the war and United Nations'
sanctions against Yugoslavia.
Britain yesterday despatched a first party of Germany-based troops to Bosnia
and fended off criticism by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, about the time
taken deploying forces to help UN relief efforts, writes David White,
Defence Correspondent.
The UK contingent, the largest among the forces assigned to the UN
Protection Force II, is being increased by a third from initial plans
announced a month ago, to 2,400. This will include 400 engineers sent to set
up accommodation, water supplies and sanitation.
Britain has to change its initial plans for escorting aid convoys in order
to avoid crossing ethnic boundaries. Its force, to be fully deployed by
November 13, will have its main logistics centre at the port of Split, with
a battalion base at Vitez, northwest of Sarajevo. The new UN force includes
French, Canadian and Spanish units.
The leader of Bosnia's Serbs, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said yesterday he would
return home from Geneva this weekend to persuade his forces to hand over
their aircraft to United Nations monitors. Mr Karadzic spoke after
Major-General Zivomir Ninkovic, head of the rebel Serb air force, refused to
honour an agreement made in Geneva by Mr Karadzic after he came under
intense pressure from peace mediator Lord Owen.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Europe's steel industry peers into the abyss: Collapsing
prices threaten to undo the gains from restructuring in the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS crisis time again in the European steel industry. Falling demand,
lower exports and increased cut-price imports have in the past few months
accelerated a gradual decline in prices that began in mid-1989. Worse is to
come.
The steel market, says Sheffield-based consultancy Meps Europe, is in
disarray. Steelmakers are rushing to offer customers incentives on already
'incredibly low' selling prices.
Some EC steelmakers, it says, are offering to sell 25 per cent of deliveries
to customers as 'over-rollings,' which are invoiced at a substantially lower
price than for prime material. In reality, all the material delivered is
prime. Other mills are delivering on a 'pay-as-you-use basis' or offering
extra rebates in return for guarantees to purchase specified quantities of
steel.
Last month, says Meps in a review out next week, steel prices plummeted in
Germany, France and the Benelux countries as low-priced offers from
steelmakers in EC countries which have devalued their currencies disrupted
the market.
Almost all Europe's steelmakers are running at a loss, as the downward price
spiral forces them to sell below their full cost of production. 'The
industry is feeling very shell-shocked,' says a consultant, Dr Rod Beddows.
'People are saying it's the end of the world.'
This week, Europe's steelmakers got together to try to avert the looming
catastrophe. Through Eurofer, the confederation of EC iron and steel
producers, they submitted to the European Commission an ambitious scheme
seeking financial support for redundancies; guidelines from the Commission
on production, consumption, exports and imports to help the industry adapt
to changing demand, and action against allegedly unfair imports,
particularly from eastern Europe.
The scheme raises a decades-old public policy dilemma that sank from view
all too briefly in the boom years of the late 1980s - how to handle the
long-term decline of a politically sensitive industrial sector whose
importance tapers off in a developed economy. But this time the policy
responses could be different.
Eurofer is adamant that is not crying wolf. Without urgent help, says Mr
Dietrich von Hulsen, Eurofer director general, the industry could throw away
all the achievements from the restructuring of the industry in the 1980s,
and risks returning to the 'unilateral financial measures' once common in
the industry - state subsidies which are against EC law.
Yet it is fair to ask quite how an industry which has received an estimated
DM121bn (Pounds 48bn) of direct subsidies over the past 15 years, and was
turned upside down in the 1980s, has got itself in its current fix.
In 1988, the industry emerged from eight years under the Davignon plan,
named after the commissioner responsible, and introduced under the Article
58 'crisis' clause in the 1951 European Coal and Steel Community Treaty.
During that time, production capacity for hot-rolled products fell from
194.5m tonnes in 1980 to 165m tonnes and employment was slashed from 672,000
to 409,000. The steel industry emerged from the Davignon period financially
stronger, helped by state aid, and apparently well positioned to make
profits.
But the late-1980s boom was too short for companies to benefit fully, and
the subsequent recession has exposed the industry's structural weaknesses
and failure to learn from past mistakes. Overcapacity is estimated at 10-20
per cent, and the industry is still chasing market share and hence
depressing its own prices.
In particular, it is shooting itself in the foot by matching the low prices
for subsidised East European steel. The effect on overall prices has
therefore grown out of all proportion to the relatively small amounts
imported.
Prices for flat products, for example, are now 30 per cent below 1989
levels. Earlier this month, the International Iron and Steel Institute
forecast EC steel consumption at 105.4m tonnes for 1992, down nearly 10 per
cent from 115.5m tonnes in 1990. The estimate, says Eurofer, is 'rather
optimistic.'
With little or no chance of the situation changing in the short term,
Eurofer wants EC help so that the industry's restructuring can continue.
Meps expects 70,000 of the remaining 385,000 jobs in the EC steel industry
to go by the end of 1996, and another heavy round of mergers and
consolidations is looming.
While some in the industry have called for another Davignon plan, Eurofer is
not invoking Article 58. It wants a large part of the Ecu750m (Pounds 590m)
fund established under the coal and steel treaty used to help finance
another 50,000 job cuts which the industry is planning over the next three
to four years, notably in the Netherlands and Germany.
Discussions with the Commission are in their early stages, but Mr von Hulsen
believes the EC has a responsibility under the treaty to prevent the sector
sinking further.
However, the restructuring could cost Ecu4bn in total, and would almost
certainly exacerbate the row between the US and the EC over steel trade. US
steelmakers who have to finance redundancies themselves would complain
violently, says Dr Beddows.
There are doubts too, over whether the EC would any longer be prepared to
intervene in the steel industry to such an extent as to draw up production
and trade 'guidelines'. Whatever the result of the Eurofer plea, west
European steel producers should do what they can to stabilise prices by
helping their east European counterparts develop viable marketing and
pricing strategies in return for agreed shipment levels, says Dr Beddows.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Brazil's reforms win praise from Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has praised Brazil for its
sweeping trade liberalisation programme, implemented despite serious
economic difficulties in just two years.
In a report yesterday the Gatt secretariat says the trade reforms have
achieved impressive results in bringing about a marked change of direction
in Brazil's long tradition of inward-looking policies.
However, Gatt warns that the liberalisation efforts could be put at risk by
failure to tackle domestic economic imbalances, including rampant inflation,
and achieve sustained economic growth.
Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's Gatt ambassador, assured Gatt's governing council
during discussion of the report that the new government of President Itamar
Franco was committed to the liberalisation process. He said the economic
reforms commanded a growing consensus within Brazilian society.
The economic system based on import substitution and state intervention,
under which Brazil had built up its diversified industrial base to become
the world's tenth biggest economy, had not failed but had reached its
limits, Mr Amorim said.
Trade liberalisation has been a key element in Brazil's structural
adjustment programme adopted by the incoming democratic government in March
1990 to stabilise the economy and boost industrial efficiency and
competitiveness. Brazil is a leading exporter of coffee, soy meal, orange
juice, iron ore and steel products. Its main customers are the US and EC.
Since 1990 the Brazilian government has scrapped almost all import
restrictions, streamlined trade procedures and slashed tariffs, notes the
report. Remaining restrictions in the informatics sector are due to end this
month and by mid-1993 tariffs will average just over 14 per cent against 41
per cent in 1989.
'A highly restricted and regulated trade regime has been changed in a
relatively very short time into one largely free of quantitative
restrictions,' the report says. It has thus 'become considerably more
transparent and less discretionary'.
However, the Gatt secretariat says price and exchange rate stability, and
sustained economic growth, are 'a necessary condition' for consolidation of
the reforms. 'Failure to control inflation, to revive economic activity, and
to tackle rising unemployment, would increase the political odds against the
success of the liberalisation experiment.'
Though the recent debt restructuring agreement signed by Brazil with
commercial banks 'should ease some of the pressures on economic management',
inflation is still running at over 20 per cent a month while sluggish
economic activity in recent years has cut real incomes.
The report adds that Brazil's membership of the Southern Cone Common Market
(Mercosur) cannot provide a substitute for a successful conclusion to the
Uruguay Round of global trade talks, which would improve Brazil's access to
markets in industrial nations for its exports.
Many of its principal exports are affected by trade restrictions in foreign
markets, while dumping of farm surpluses by the major traders is preventing
Brazil from expanding agricultural exports.
The country's trading patterns make it likely to benefit more from
multilateral liberalisation than from bilateral or regional groupings.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Italian unions win Amato concession on pensions cap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S trade unions, which staged a four-hour general strike over welfare
cuts on Tuesday, have won limited concessions from the Amato government.
The government agreed to a slight lifting of the ceiling on pensions
proposed for next year and said pension payments would rise a total of 3.5
per cent next year in two tranches. To compensate, the government introduced
measures to cover the extra expenditure.
In a second concession, the government replaced the proposed ceiling of L40m
(Pounds 18,000) annual income which would trigger a cut-off in health
service benefits. This would have excluded 20m people, according to the
unions. A formula has been introduced lowering the ceiling to L35m for
single people but raising it to L65m for large families.
The semi-indexation of pensions, at just over 1 percentage point below
inflation, will cost an extra L3,600bn. However, the government insisted the
overall target of holding the public sector deficit to L93,000bn remained in
place.
Extra revenue of L1,500bn would be raised by two main devices: a 1 per cent
increase in national insurance contributions from those with incomes over
L52m; and L800bn by making ENEL, the electricity authority, cover itself the
cost of servicing debts contracted during 1986-89.
The government yesterday converted into a decree law the bill ending the
dockers' monopoly in Italy's ports, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
The European Commission had set a September 30 deadline for ending the
monopoly and the decision, though it will be welcomed by port employers, may
trigger fresh industrial action.
Prosecutors are examining government files on Italy's aid operation for
Albania after members of parliament alleged some food suppliers had been
overcharging, Reuter adds from Rome.
Italy donated 125,000 tonnes of food to help Albania through the winter of
1991 after an exodus across the Adriatic of 45,000 refugees fleeing hunger
and poverty the previous March and August.

Hungary has called for a special meeting of the eight-nation Danube
Commission to discuss Slovakia's plans to divert the river across its
territory this month, a commission official said yesterday. The Danube forms
part of the two states' common border, Reuter reports from Budapest.
The move is part of Hungary's efforts to prevent the creation of a
billion-dollar hydroelectric scheme, which Budapest says would cause an
environmental catastrophe and violate Hungary's territorial integrity.
Slovakia, which will quit the Czechoslovakian federation early next year, is
due to divert the Danube on October 20 to drive its Gabcikovo hydroelectric
power station.

Norway's parliament is expected to ratify the European Economic Area (EEA)
agreement by a narrow margin today, despite many demonstrations against the
deal, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
The pact - to link the European Community and the European Free Trade
Association, of which Norway is a member - needs the backing of two-thirds
of the country's 165-seat parliament. At least 42 votes would be needed to
block it, but only 35 or 37 representatives are expected to vote against it.
About 20,000 North Sea oil workers staged a one-hour strike opposing the
ratification, which they claim would jeopardise their jobs when Norway is
opened to foreign competition.

FT  16 OCT 92 / West's fears delay repair to reactors: E Europe's crumbling
N-plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTERNATIONAL convention to smooth the way to repair of eastern Europe's
crumbling nuclear reactors is being held up by fears among western
governments and companies that they will be held liable for future
radioactive leaks.
As governments wrestled with the problem at a meeting of the International
Atomic Energy Agency conference in Vienna yesterday, the Ignalina reactor in
Lithuania, the world's largest remaining Chernobyl-type reactor, was shut
down for the second time in two months after an internal radiation detector
reported 50 times the normal level of radioactivity. Lithuanian radio said
there was no danger to local residents.
At the same time, environment officials in Bulgaria said the accident-ridden
Kozloduy nuclear power plant almost exploded last month when the main switch
on a 1,000MW unit short-circuited.
Kozloduy has been described as Europe's most dangerous reactor, and the EC
has provided emergency funds for repairs. It cannot be shut down because it
supplies half Bulgaria's electricity, and its output was due to be increased
in the next few weeks because of colder weather.
The week-long IAEA meeting has been split over a proposal to make United
Nations countries collectively foot the bill for cleaning up after future
nuclear leaks. The convention will determine who is liable.
The question of liability has become an acute concern since the European
Commission began providing funds in the past two years for urgent repairs to
the eastern European and former Soviet reactors. Piecemeal repairs are
proceeding but many companies have refused to accept liability.
Mr David Kyd, spokesman for the IAEA, said: 'There has been great uneasiness
among western manufacturers that if something goes wrong in those reactors
they could face law suits because their name is on the equipment.'
He added: 'This convention will eventually cover that issue, but maybe not
soon enough to solve the immediate problems.'
The IAEA and Germany have proposed to the agency's standing committee on
nuclear liability, which is drawing up the convention, that all signatories
should collectively assume liability, including liability for former Soviet
and eastern European reactors to enable them to obtain finance for repairs.
However, Britain and France have objected that other countries should not be
forced to pay for accidents at the eastern European reactors.
The IAEA standing committee has moved towards a consensus that there should
be an international commission to settle claims for liability, although
Britain and France have also resisted this move.
A final decision on the liability question is unlikely before the standing
committee's next meeting in March.

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Philip Morris shares fall on
lower US tobacco sales
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Philip Morris, which earlier this week won control of
Scandinavia's Freia Marabou in a Dollars 1.5bn bid, fell yesterday after the
tobacco and food company reported a small decline in domestic cigarette
shipments in the third quarter, and predicted a much larger fall in the
final three months.
By lunchtime, the shares were down Dollars 4 1/4 at Dollars 79 3/4 .
Overall, the company - one of the nation's most reliable profit generators -
posted a 16.4 per cent rise in net income, at Dollars 1.29bn, for the third
quarter.
The advance, which came on a 9 per cent sales increase, translated into a 20
per cent rise in earnings per share, to Dollars 1.44. Philip Morris said it
still expected to post a 20 per cent increase in full-year earnings per
share.
But the third quarter threw up a significantly smaller, 10.5 per cent
increase in operating profits, at Dollars 2.81bn. This reflected strong
advances from the international tobacco and food divisions, single-digit
profits growth in the domestic tobacco and food operations, and declining
profits at the Miller Brewing Company subsidiary, the nation's
second-largest beer manufacturer.
In the big domestic tobacco business - which accounts for almost half of
operating profits - the company saw cigarette shipments fall by 0.5 per cent
to 53bn units, although sales, in value terms, were up by 5.4 per cent at
Dollars 2.97bn, and operating profits 8.5 per cent higher at Dollars 1.3bn.
Morris warned that the trend would continue.
Results from the brewing business were also disappointing, with operating
profits falling from Dollars 94m to Dollars 55m on sales of Dollars 1.04bn
(down from Dollars 1.13bn).
By contrast, the international tobacco business pushed up operating profits
from Dollars 497m to Dollars 589m, and the international food side saw a
rise from Dollars 209m to Dollars 277m.
The results leave Philip Morris posting after-tax profits of Dollars 3.74bn
(up from Dollars 2.24bn) on sales of Dollars 44.2bn (up from Dollars 42.8bn)
for the first nine months.

KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering, shipping and shipbuilding group,
reported a NKr56m fall in pre-tax profits to NKr694m (Dollars 116.44m),
caused by a loss by its mechanical engineering division and weak shipping
results. However, profits for the year will remain on the same level as last
year's NKr1.1bn.
Group operating profit, after depreciation of NKr438m, was slightly up to
NKr560m from NKr556m last year, when depreciation was NKr414m.
Operating revenue rose by NKr347m to NKr11.977bn as operating costs
increased by NKr255m to NKr10.949bn. The mechanical engineering division
plunged into a loss of NKr162m from a NKr7m profit last year, despite a
NKr66m rise in sales to NKr2.646bn. Kvaerner warned of unsatisfactory
results for the year as a whole.
Shipping profits declined by NKr168m to NKr45m as revenue was reduced by
NKr176m to NKr654m. Kvaerner said the remainder of the year would produce
poor results, despite a seasonal upturn for gas carriers in the last
four-month period.
The offshore division improved profit by NKr18m to NKr124m as revenue rose
by NKr768m to NKr3.433bn. Good results are expected for the year as a whole.
Shipbuilding improved profit by NKr155m to NKr494m as revenue rose by
NKr236m to NKr4.140bn.
The Govan yard at Glasgow, Scotland, continues to operate at a loss, but its
performance has improved considerably since extensive restructuring. Good
results for the division are expected for 1992.
The pulping division boosted profit by NKr63m to NKr144m despite a NKr687m
fall to NKr1.227bn in revenue.

KYMMENE, the Finnish pulp and paper group, made a FM849m (Dollars 183.37m)
loss after financial items for the first eight months of the year, compared
with a FM634m deficit for the same period of 1991.
Turnover also fell slightly to FM8.421bn from FM8.531bn while operating
profit was FM243m, down from FM335m. Mr Harri Piehl, chief executive, said
the group would make a greater loss in 1992 than expected, though smaller
than the FM1.299bn of last year.
The company expects to save FM500m in earnings through cost-cutting and
productivity improvement measures. It said last November's 12.3 per cent
devaluation of the markka had improved its overseas competitiveness, but the
flotation of the markka and turbulence on international money markets made
it hard to assess the outlook.
Mr Piehl said the group's future profits were 'critically dependent on the
market for printing and writing papers,' which account for around 70 per
cent of turnover.

FT LIS, the information technology arm of France Telecom, the French
telecommunications authority, and Paribas are establishing a company to hold
the French bank's 39 per cent shareholding in Sema Group, the Anglo-French
computing services company quoted in London.
The new holding company will be owned 50.1 per cent by Paribas and 49.9 per
cent by France Telecom Group. Mr Charles Rozmaryn, head of France Telecom,
and Mr Michel Huet, head of FT LIS, will join the Sema board.
The arrangement is part of Paribas' industrial rationalisation programme
which has already generated deep controversy through its disposal of Ciments
Francais to the Italian company Italcementi. After purchasing a controlling
stake in the cement company, Italcementi discovered substantial off-balance
sheet losses at its new acquisition.
Sema Group, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.73m (Dollars 13.29m) on
turnover of Pounds 195.4m at the interim stage, has been seeking a partner
to extend its coverage of the communications sector where at present sales
are only about Pounds 7m annually. It hopes to treble its volume of
communications business through its association with France Telecom. Talks
some years ago with British Telecom with a similar objective were called off
at an early stage.

<TEXT>
METRA, the Finnish industrial group, reported yesterday a FM56m (Dollars
12.1m) loss for the first eight months of the year, a marked improvement on
the FM201m deficit suffered for the same period of 1991.
The group expects to make a profit for the whole of the year, compared with
a FM203m loss for the last financial year.
Net sales for the first eight months were Fm3.676bn, 18 per cent down from
the FM4.460bn recorded on the same period of 1991 as a result of recent
divestments. Metra added that sales were expected to reach around FM10bn for
the full year.
Metra said its sanitary equipment division (Sanitec) had seen a weakening in
profits, and net sales had not marched expectations, mainly due to
industrial disruption last summer in Germany.
The group said profits for the full year in its security division were
expected to improve slightly, but still remain unsatisfactory for the year.
Its steel operations and caravan division made a loss in the period.

HACHETTE, the French media group, stayed in the red during the first half of
this year, but forecasts a return to profit for the full financial year.
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the chairman of Hachette who is orchestrating its
merger with Matra, the defence electronics concern that also forms part of
his family's business interests, told shareholders that Hachette was on
course to meet its forecast of net profits of between FFr100m and FFr200m
((Dollars 20.92m-Dollars 41.84m) this year.
Hachette, which has extensive interests in magazine and book publishing,
made a net loss of FFr39.3m in the first half against a loss of FFr30.4m in
the same period of last year on turnover which fell by 2.4 per cent to
FFr14.5bn. It said the losses were due to 'seasonal factors' and would not
prevent it from producing a profit for the full year.
The group is expected to disclose full details of the Matra merger after the
Paris commercial court has ruled on the bankruptcy of La Cinq, the
television company, late next month. Hachette, which was the managing
shareholder of La Cinq before its demise, earlier this week indicated that
the merger was likely to involve it absorbing Matra.
Last week, Hachette's shares fluctuated on the Paris stock market on
speculation about the merger package and on rumours (later denied) of
stake-building by Havas, another force in French media. The Commission des
Operations de Bourse, the French stock market watchdog, is investigating the
share price movements.

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: S-E Banken credit losses double
to SKr6.85bn

<TEXT>
SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, suffered a
SKr2.607bn (Dollars 474.4m) operating loss in the first eight months of the
year, compared with a SKr1.68bn operating profit over the same period of
1991.
Operating profits (before loan losses) totalled SKr4.24bn, down 13 per cent
on the SKr4.85bn in the same period of last year. Receipts fell 7 per cent
to SKr9.3bn.
Credit losses have soared over the past eight months to SKr6.85bn, more than
twice the SKr3.173bn for the January-August period of last year.
Mr Bjorn Svedberg, president and chief executive, refused to make a forecast
for the year because of uncertainties over interest rates.
SEB says it has problems with 6.3 per cent of its current loans, totalling
SKr19.741bn, compared with 3.0 per cent (SKr9.580bn) at the end of last
year. Up to 78.2 per cent of credit losses in the first eight months derived
from lending to property companies, banks and finance houses.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Overseas holidays expected to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of people taking an overseas holiday could fall next year in
spite of an encouraging start to summer 1993 bookings, a survey published
yesterday suggests.
The survey, conducted for Lunn Poly, the biggest UK travel agency, revealed
that 32 per cent of the 1,000 people questioned planned to take a summer
holiday abroad next year. In last year's survey, 44 per cent said they
planned to take a foreign holiday in summer 1992. In the event, only 22 per
cent did so.
In spite of indications that the recession has dented holidaymakers'
confidence, summer 1993 bookings are up 5 per cent on last year according to
Mr Peter Rothwell, Lunn Poly marketing director.
A total of 950,000 holidays have already been sold for next summer. Lunn
Poly's own sales are up by 45 per cent.
Travel industry officials add that the early boost to bookings reflects the
strength of the north of England economy compared with the south. As flights
from regional airports are more limited than those from London,
holidaymakers book earlier to ensure they can go away during school and
factory holidays.
Sales of this year's winter holidays are down by 12 per cent. Mr Rothwell
attributed this to later booking of holidays this past summer. Travel
industry sources point out that winter holidays tend to be more popular
among those who, in better times, took second holidays.
The survey showed, however, that 41 per cent of people would be prepared to
cut other forms of expenditure to take overseas holidays.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Labour sees threat to hospital jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB LOSSES among health service workers in London resulting from hospital
closures could reach unacceptable levels, Mr David Blunkett, Labour's shadow
health secretary, warned yesterday.
He called on Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, to produce a
coherent strategy for all sectors of healthcare in the capital before the
implementation of any closures arising from the Tomlinson report.
The report on health provision in London, by Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former
chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority, is expected shortly.
Mr Blunkett said: 'In essence, we are trying to avoid happening to London
healthcare and London health workers what is happening this week to the
mining industry and the miners.' He insisted that Labour's support for any
closures was conditional on remedies for the 'scandal' of current
inadequacies in community and primary care.
'Tomlinson must not be used to bring about cuts in funding and the switch of
resources to meet the government's pledges for the coming year in other
parts of the country,' Mr Blunkett said.
Conditions in the 'agenda for change' which the government would have to
fulfil to secure Labour support for any closures included:
No changes before the pressure on acute services and the action needed to
cut London's waiting lists is assessed.
An agreed strategy for replacement facilities. A London regional health
authority to be established. All decisions on individual hospitals to be
based on health needs rather than site value.

FT  16 OCT 92 / BT fears rivalry from cable networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications is seriously concerned about growing competition
from cable companies offering telephone services.
Mr Arthur Thompson, a senior BT marketing manager, has warned staff that if
it does not respond effectively to the competitive threat, BT could lose up
to Pounds 500m in residential business by 1996.
The warning appears in Prospect, BT's internal magazine for marketing staff.
Mr Thompson says that cable franchises cover 14m BT customers and 'will put
at risk over 60 per cent of our residential revenue'. This, he concedes,
constitutes an even bigger threat to BT's residential business than that of
Mercury Communications, the Cable and Wireless subsidiary.
The number of cable telephone customers is modest, but the upward trend is
dramatic. Figures from the Independent Television Commission show that the
number of cable lines grew from 2,224 in January last year to 47,902 in July
this year.
Many of the large cable investors are north American telephone companies
which are building cable networks with capacity for telephones. Customers
are being offered discounts of up to 15 per cent.
Mr Thompson concludes: 'The cable companies are highly professional. We can
certainly beat them, but only if all parts of BT work together.'

FT  16 OCT 92 / Output of cars rises by 14.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sharp contrast between the severely depressed UK market for new cars and
the British car industry's production levels was emphasised yesterday by
statistics showing that car output rose by 14.4 per cent in September
compared with the same month a year before.
The September output figures, which included a 25.39 per cent jump in
production for export, lifted total car production for the first nine months
of this year to 962,155 - 1.88 per cent ahead of the 944,382 produced in the
same period of last year.
The statistics, published jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Central Statistical Office, showed total car production in
September at 103,738 compared with 90,613 in the same month a year before.
Production for the UK market, at 42,932, was virtually unchanged from last
year's level of 42,120.
The SMMT, in a thinly veiled disagreement with the Treasury yesterday,
pointed out that September's statistics more than compensated for a 7.75 per
cent drop in car output in August. The Treasury, commenting on 'obviously
disappointing' output for industry in August, had said the sharp drop
experienced had been 'more than accounted for' by lower car production.

FT  16 OCT 92 / North West challenges Ofwat on price increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH WEST WATER was the only water and sewerage company to challenge by
last night's deadline the request of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, to
hold back next spring's price rises.
North West said it had issued a counter-notice - a formal appeal - to
Ofwat's statement two weeks ago that if it held back prices as much as Ofwat
had asked it would not be able to afford to clean up the Mersey as required
by new environmental rules.
Two weeks ago Ofwat told the 10 large water and sewerage companies and nine
of the 22 smaller water-only companies that they should hold back next
spring's price rises by an average of 2 percentage points.
Their licences allow prices to rise each year by the rate of inflation plus
a 'K' factor, but Ofwat has argued that construction costs have been lower
than expected because of the recession, and that the benefits should reach
consumers. It gave the companies until midnight last night to respond.
Mr Clive Elphick, North West's general manager for economic regulation,
said: 'We have had to spend Pounds 430m more than planned - an extra year's
spending - between 1989 and 1994.'
Thames, Severn Trent, Anglian, Northumbrian, Wessex and Yorkshire have not
issued counter-notices. They have, however, persuaded Ofwat in the past two
weeks that they should hold back prices by between 0.4 per cent and 1 per
cent, less than half the level that Ofwat originally requested. Of those,
Anglian, Thames, Northumbrian and Yorkshire have struck two-year deals with
Ofwat, so they will avoid further changes before Ofwat's wide-ranging review
of the industry pricing structure in 1994.
Southern Water is the only company to have agreed a higher 'K' with Ofwat.
Its prices will rise next spring by inflation plus 3.9 per cent, against 3.5
per cent last year.
Mr Graham Hawker, managing director of Welsh Water, said: 'We told our
customers in June that we would hold back prices by 1.5 per cent, and Ofwat
has agreed that, so we have not sent a counter-notice.' Last night South
West Water had not issued a counter-notice or completed discussions with
Ofwat.

FT  16 OCT 92 / British Coal bidder pulls out of race: Customer's imports to
rise tenfold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO UNITED, British Coal's second-largest customer after the electricity
generators, has withdrawn as a possible bidder for the nationalised industry
because the severity of the pit cuts has left the operation too small to be
of interest.
The company is also being forced to increase its annual coal imports from
100,000 tonnes to almost 1m tonnes because of the pit closures.
Mr David McErlain, chairman, said yesterday: 'Eighteen months ago we were
looking at a business with 30 mines selling 50m tonnes to the generators.
Now it is only 20 mines. It's suddenly a small industry and getting
smaller.'
Mr McErlain also said that executives from his company would visit Australia
and South Africa shortly to discuss purchases of coal.
Anglo United owns the Coalite smokeless fuel company and also distributes 3m
tonnes of coal a year. But many of the UK mines that supply the company are
on the shutdown list. British Coal will try to meet its needs, but there
will be a growing shortfall.
Mr McErlain blamed the growth of gas-fired power generation for the
shrinkage of coal, and urged that Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
electricity regulator, investigate it.
'I hope that the government will look at this and see that people are
worried about the viability, and get it looked into,' he said.
Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former commercial director of British Coal who left
after disagreements over the cuts, is to lead a consortium which will
attempt to lease four pits due for closure in South Yorkshire: Markham Main,
Hatfield, Bentley and Rossington.
Mr Edwards told BBC Leeds: 'Here we are dealing with mines, it has been said
over and over again, which are among the best in Europe.' He said he had
held talks with Brian Nichols Associates of New South Wales who would
operate the mines.
Mr Crispian Hotson, chief executive of Ryan Group, the UK's largest private
coal mining company, said he had put a proposal to Mr Eggar to break British
Coal into five competing companies, with two in the Midlands and one in each
of Wales, the north-east and Scotland. That would break up centralised
decision-making, he said, and increase efficiency.
'Selling it as a single entity or a fudged duopoly will never achieve the
right end. If the right amount of competition is introduced, British Coal
could be the envy of the industry.'

<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST capital project undertaken by a Training and Enterprise Council,
a Pounds 10m business training centre described as Britain's first
commercial campus, will be inaugurated today.
Northumberland Tec - one of the organisations that deliver government-funded
training schemes in England and Wales - has bought Longhirst, a listed
mansion in 45 acres of parkland near Morpeth, for management training and
business education.
Longhirst Hall is to be refurbished and run from September next year by the
Tec as a management training and conference centre.
The Northumberland Tec will also build a business college for the expanding
University of Northumbria at Newcastle upon Tyne, formerly Newcastle
Polytechnic.
The college, opening in stages from September, will offer degree, diploma
and certificate courses in business studies, management, marketing and
accountancy for 600 full-time and part-time students, with a target of 1,000
by the year 2000.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Feltrim managers 'misunderstood' LMX markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGERS of the loss-making Feltrim syndicates 'did not understand the
true nature' of the reinsurance markets in which they were active, a Lloyd's
loss review has concluded.
The 850-page report by a committee chaired by Sir Patrick Neill QC was sent
yesterday to Names (the individuals whose assets back underwriting at
Lloyd's) affected by the losses. It has taken more than a year to prepare.
Syndicates 540/542 and 847 specialised in London market excess-of-loss (LMX)
or spiral catastrophe reinsurance, in which syndicates at Lloyd's and
insurance companies re-insured each other's exposure to high-level
catastrophe loss.
Between 1987 and 1990 the syndicates were hit by a sequence of catastrophes
which produced claims 'on a scale which was without precedent in insurance
history', says the report.
Reviews covering the losses of LMX syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, Rose
Thomson Young and Devonshire have been completed in the past two months.
Some 1,000 Feltrim Names suffered losses in excess of Pounds 450m, a level
described as totally unacceptable.
A Name trading on syndicate 540/542 in 1987, 1988 and 1989 would have faced
a loss of more than Pounds 73,700 for each Pounds 10,000 traded.
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, called the report
'a savage indictment of the Lloyd's system'. He said: 'It highlights an
appalling series of errors and incompetence. No one comes out of it well.'
He said it would assist the Names in their campaign for compensation.
The report says Feltrim was 'unaware of certain critical factors relevant to
the assessment of the degree of risk in the LMX market'. It adds that
Feltrim's managers and underwriters did not appreciate the scale of loss to
which they were exposed. Their reinsurance was inadequate, it says. In 1987,
for example, the two syndicates shared a reinsurance programme for the 1987
account, partially because of cost constraints.
The reinsurance programme of syndicate 540/42 was designed to protect dollar
exposures, but the big losses of 1987 and 1988 - the UK hurricane of October
1987 and the explosion on the Piper Alpha oil rig in July 1988 - produced
claims that were paid in sterling.
Mr Patrick Fagan, the underwriter of syndicate 540/542, told the Neill
committee that the 'ethos of the syndicates was to protect against the big
US windstorm'. The syndicates were also hit by the failure of insurance
companies with which they were reinsured.
Sir Patrick found no evidence of dishonesty or fraudulence in Feltrim's
affairs.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Tory MPs join forces under the rebels' banner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN in Slough, deep in the Tory Home Counties and far from any colliery,
the cuts at British Coal have already prompted 20 telephone calls to the
local Conservative association.
Mr John Watts, the town's Tory MP and a senior backbencher - he is chairman
of the all-party Treasury committee - is rarely disruptive. But he says he
would ask some pretty tough questions if parliament were sitting.
'I would certainly want to have proved to me that the government had
examined all the options,' he says.
He is one of the Tories whose anxiety is only partly buried because the
Commons is in recess. That anxiety is likely to surface with force when MPs
return on Monday as the debate over the pit closures is becoming part of the
wider concern over the government's handling of the economy, increasing the
pressure on ministers.
Sir Michael Grylls, chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry
committee, says: 'There is anxiety because it is a very difficult moment. We
are not yet out of the recession.' He adds, however: 'But we are on our way
out.'
The government whips will have their work cut out next week to stop a revolt
which could threaten the government's slender majority of 21.
On the face of it, the Conservatives have little emotional attachment to the
coal industry, and Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of
Mineworkers, is not likely to win any friends on the Tory benches.
Apart from four of the 32 constituencies with pits, most mining seats are
held with thumping majorities by Labour members - six have worked down mines
 -who form a tightly knit and vociferous but often unheard coal lobby at
Westminster.
But Conservative MPs are not immune from the industry's woes. Two
constituencies in mining areas were lost to Labour in the April general
election.
Many Tory-held constituencies are near mining constituencies, and two are
held by junior trade and industry ministers Mr Edward Leigh (Gainsborough
and Horncastle) and Mr Neil Hamilton (Tatton).
Mr James Lester, Conservative MP for Broxtowe, which had three mines when he
first won the seat, says that Tory local campaigning has been set back 'by
10 years' in Nottinghamshire.
'The ordinary fellow not only supports the miners but has a feeling for the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers who withstood the coal strike,' he says,
although he believes there is a 'grim inevitability' about the announcement.
Home secretary Mr Kenneth Clarke, the son of a miner and MP for the mining
area of Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, admitted on BBC radio that 'it was a
very critical time' for the county.
Mr William Cash, a fierce opponent of Maastricht and Tory MP for Stafford,
says the decision is a 'kick in the teeth' for miners at the Silverdale and
Trentham mines, near his constituency, who, he says, broke the 1984-85
strike.
'It is an absolute disgrace both in the manner in which it was done and the
absurdity of closing down national assets which cannot be revived once the
decision has been implemented . . . the bottom line is that British miners
are being thrown on the slagheap for the preservation of German coal-mining
jobs.'
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Tory MP for Macclesfield, has added to the flurry of
letters of protest sent to Mr John Major and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary. 'It is vital that we use our indigenous energy resources
such as coal and that we don't squander gas,' he says.
Mr Cash and Mr Winterton are regular rebels. However, other less predictable
rebels are emerging from the Tory ranks.
Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, from the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen, and Mr
Winston Churchill, from Davyhulme in Greater Manchester, were among the
first to appear on television.
'I'm all in favour of free markets but the government should not let a
strategic industry die,' Mrs Peacock said. 'The government must encourage,
and if necessary intervene, in the dispute on the coal price between British
Coal and the electricity companies.'
Even among Tories who believe that closures were necessary, there is alarm
at the speed at which they have been implemented - betraying a wider fear at
the pace at which the recession is spreading.
'The whole thing should not have been as abrupt, but should have been spread
over a longer period because of the impact on human beings,' says Mr David
Knox, MP for Staffordshire Moorlands - not far from the Staffordshire pits.
Mr Michael Fabricant, Tory MP for Mid-Staffordshire, is prepared to support
the government, arguing that coal is 'not the energy of the future' and that
to insist on power stations using coal 'is like saying that the railways
should use steam trains'.
But he calls for help for other industries to weather the recession. 'It is
ludicrous to say that we won't support industries which our competitors are
supporting. That means an industrial strategy. Sure it means getting
inflation down, sure it means getting interest rates down but it still won't
be enough.'
Mr John Biffen, Tory MP for Shropshire north and a former cabinet minister,
is prepared to let economic arguments rule but says the pace at which change
was brought about needed 'caution rather than self-confidence'.
From his constituency, which once included a mining community, he hints that
he believes the government has tripped badly, quoting Browning: 'Never glad
confident morning again]'

FT  16 OCT 92 / Two administrators of Polly Peck are fined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the administrators of Polly Peck International, the fruit and
electronics conglomerate that collapsed two years ago with debts of Pounds
1.3bn, have been found guilty by the disciplinary committee of the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales of breaching ethical
guidelines.
Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gulley, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
and Mr Richard Stone, the firm's senior corporate finance partner, were
yesterday fined Pounds 1,000 by the committee but will not face further
penalties. These could have included their suspension as administrators of
the company.
The charges arose from the fact that there had been a continuing
professional relationship between Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Polly Peck, and its
chairman Mr Asil Nadir, during the three years before the company was placed
in administration in October 1990.
Both Mr Jordan and Mr Stone have always denied that they acted in any way
improperly. The hearing began in July and has been closely followed in the
accountancy profession, where there was some disappointment at the decision
by the committee that the hearing should be held in private.
In its ruling, the committee noted that there had been no suggestion that
either man had intentionally failed to ascertain the prior connections of
their firm with Polly Peck.
The committee also emphasised that there was no criticism of the way that Mr
Jordan and Mr Stone have conducted the Polly Peck administration.
Mr Jordan and Mr Stone now have 28 days in which to consider whether to
appeal against the ruling.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Eggar sets out sell-off dates: Minister sees 'long road' to
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will press ahead with plans to privatise British Coal in
spite of the mounting furore over the decision to close more than half of
its pits.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday that he hoped to present
legislation late next month or by Christmas at the latest.
But he said there would be 'a long road' to privatisation, and he did not
expect the shape and form of the sale to be completed until next July at the
earliest.
Meanwhile, he said, 'no irrevocable decisions have been taken on issues of
concern to those involved in the privatisation'.
Mr Eggar, addressing an Institute of Energy conference, said that four
issues would be taken into account:
The safety and health of mineworkers in a newly privatised industry must be
paramount.
The reduced energy costs resulting from the cuts at British Coal must be
passed to consumers by the generators.
The mining and marketing of coal should be kept separate from the leasing
and licensing of exploration and production. There would be a new licensing
authority which would have no conflict of interest in awarding licences.
The pensions and concessionary fuel entitlements of past and present
employees must be safeguarded.
Mr Eggar also repeated a commitment to give management and staff the
opportunity to have a stake in the business. He stressed that no decisions
had yet been taken on whether there should be a trade sale, an issue of
shares or a management/employee buy-out.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Miners look to public opinion to save them: NUM stokes up
campaign to halt closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS' leaders hope that, if industrial muscle can no longer save the pits,
they can still stop the closures with the help of a poll-tax-style wave of
public discontent.
Yesterday's National Union of Mineworkers conference in Sheffield held back
from calling an immediate strike ballot, preferring to stoke up a national
and European campaign against the closures.
Statements by NUM delegates before and during the closed conference session
appear to have persuaded Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, that to call for
an immediate strike would risk splitting a severely weakened union with
little certainty of changing the government's mind.
Unusually for him, the miners' leader steered clear of making
confrontational statements. He focused instead on appearing to argue a
rational case on economic and social grounds in a language capable of being
understood by an audience wider than that formed by his more militant
supporters: 'I just want (Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary) to act decisively and sensibly and save an industry that is
economic rather than substitute it with an industry that is uneconomic.'
During the conference a delegate from the Derbyshire region warned that his
members were simply not prepared to go on strike because of the fear of
either losing their jobs or their redundancy packages.
The leader of the NUM's white-collar section, Mr Ken Hollingsworth, said
before attending the conference: 'Our men are having to weigh up that their
money might go if they take action . . . I don't think they will take the
gamble. There isn't the stomach for a fight over this but there is a great
deal of anger. It is the public that can say 'enough'.'
Another official said: 'There seems to be something stirring out there. The
fact that we are now so weak makes it a case of taking a sledgehammer to
crack a nut, and a lot of people don't like it.'
He added that the campaign would unashamedly wrap itself in the Union Jack
and argue that Britain cannot afford to let another industry disappear like
the motorcycle and shipbuilding industries.
Pressure on miners not to strike was reinforced yesterday when Mr Heseltine
repeated a warning from British Coal that mineworkers risked 'throwing away'
redundancy payments if they took industrial action.
Meanwhile Mr Roy Lynk, president of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers,
last night began his protest with an underground sit-in at the Silverhill
colliery in north Nottinghamshire. The mine is scheduled to close today.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts advance despite weakness of sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government bond market advanced in the face of the country's
deepening economic gloom yesterday, even though sterling slipped to below
DM2.46 by the end of the day.
Figures for September showed unemployment at its highest for five years,
while this week's announcement of job cuts in the coal industry and renewed
fears about the the European fighter aircraft project look set to increase
the pressure on jobs.
The gilt market's reaction was relatively modest, though, given the severity
of the latest economic signals. 'Under normal circumstances, people buy
bonds at times like this and keep buying,' said Mr Chris Anthony,of UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew. Investors continued to hold back because they were waiting
for firmer indications of the future direction of UK economic policy, he
said.
Although the government continued to hold back from an expected rate cut,
the market continued to discount such a move. Gilts rose across the maturity
spectrum, with gains of  1/2 to  2/3 of a point. On Liffe, the long gilt
futures contract jumped almost a point to end the day at 97 23/32 , though
trading volume was moderate at around 30,000 contracts.
EUROPEAN bond markets remained subdued yesterday as the latest Bundesbank
council meeting passed without any further cuts in German interest rates.
Nor were the markets enlivened by the prospect of the summit of European
leaders, starting in Birmingham today. With ministers around the EC having
ruled out significant discussions about the future of the exchange rate
mechanism, traders sensed little prospect of any agreements which would
reawaken European bond market convergence.
German government bonds ended the day firmer despite the lack of any
Bundesbank move on interest rates, with gains once again concentrated among
longer-dated bonds. The bund futures contract on Liffe rose from its opening
of 90.97 to end the day at 91.16, while the Euromark contract ended where it
had begun the day, at 91.64.
Norway will today announce the longest bond issue in more than a decade.
Analysts expect the 10-year issue to raise between NKr7bn and NKr10bn with
the funds earmarked for budget deficit financing.
AFTER a firm opening, US Treasury prices traded slightly lower late
yesterday in the wake of some mixed economic news.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 97,
yielding 7.494 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100, yielding
3.982 per cent.
The bearish news for bonds was the 16,000 decline in weekly state
unemployment insurance claims. The data disappointed bond investors, who
sold Treasuries on the news.
Prices picked up later on three sets of bullish data. The Philadelphia
Federal Reserve reported a drop in its index of regional business activity
in September, an ABC/Money magazine measurement of consumer confidence fell
for the second straight week, and the government reported a 0.2 per cent
increase in consumer prices last month, a figure that was better than the
market had anticipated.

<TEXT>
GLAVUNION, a joint venture between a Czech glassmaker and Glaverbel of
Belgium, has issued the first medium-term corporate bonds in Czechoslovakia,
paving the way for the development of a new debt market in the country.
The bonds, worth Kcs200m (Dollars 7.3m) and maturing in 1998, have a coupon
of 13.5 per cent. They are expected to be traded on the interim secondary
market.
Credit Suisse First Boston in Prague, which lead-managed the issue, has
placed the bonds with a selection of non-bank financial institutions and
corporate investors.
So far, the secondary market has only intermittently traded state bonds and
debt issued by Komercni Banka and General Credit Bank, of Bratislava, two
leading commercial banks in the Czech and Slovak republics.
The Glavunion bond issue is also expected to be one of the first securities
listed on the Prague Stock Exchange, due to open this year.
The bonds will pave the way for other local corporate borrowers to raise
money domestically outside the bank market. Local enterprises have been
hard-pressed to find affordable funds to finance investment programmes as
commercial banks are unwilling to lend money for more than one year.

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Bonds: UK expected to launch DM5bn Eurobond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPECTATION that the UK is about to launch a DM5bn five-year Eurobond
focused renewed attention on the D-Mark sector of the Eurobond market
yesterday. A number of banks are vying to win the mandate to arrange the
financing, but the timing and details of the issue are still unclear.
The Bank of England declined to comment on any financing plans.
Last month, the UK announced an Ecu10bn financing package, consisting of an
Ecu5bn three-year loan and an Ecu5bn note issuance programme. No paper has
yet been issued under the programme.
Although a number of European sovereign borrowers - including Norway,
Belgium, Finland and Italy, as well as the UK - have been eyeing the
burgeoning D-Mark sector of the Eurobond market, the recent heavy supply of
paper has increased funding costs for foreign borrowers, by eroding swap
opportunities. Higher funding costs could deter some potential issuers.
If the UK were to launch a deal priced to yield five basis points more than
the comparable German bund, as some dealers suggest, that would translate
into funding costs of 15 basis points below the London interbank offered
rate, if the proceeds were swapped, dealers said. Most borrowers will find
it impossible to achieve sub-Libor funding in the sector.
However, the sector is one of the few still open for large offerings, and
sovereign borrowers with urgent needs to replenish foreign exchange
reserves, for example, may decide to press ahead.
Despite recent supply, investor interest in the sector remains buoyant.
Sweden's DM2.5bn five-year deal launched earlier this week showed that large
benchmark offerings can attract a broad range of institutional investors to
the sector.
Yesterday, a DM200m issue by Finnish Export Credit added further supply to
the sector. The three-year issue, via Merrill Lynch Bank, was launched under
FEK's medium-term note programme.
The paper was considered fairly priced at a spread of 50 basis points above
the comparable German bond yield, but dealers said concerns about Finland's
creditworthiness deterred some investors.
Elsewhere, the financing arm of Transportacion Maritima Mexicano launched a
Dollars 75m five-year deal with a step-up coupon, and UBS Finance issued
Dollars 150m of floating-rate notes due 2002.

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Pru chief issues plea for
greater treasury detail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of one of the largest institutional investors in the UK stock
market has called for greater disclosure of corporate treasury policies in
companies' accounts.
Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief executive of Prudential Portfolio Managers, was
speaking at a conference hosted by the Association of Corporate Treasurers
in London earlier this week. Prudential Portfolio Managers has Pounds 21bn
of its Pounds 50bn of funds under management invested in the UK stock
market, accounting for 3.5 per cent of the market.
The ACT accepted a call from Mr Jenkins to 'establish a working party with
representatives of institutional shareholders in order to devise appropriate
levels of disclosure of corporate Treasury management activities for
publication in annual reports'.
The Association of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension
Funds and the Accounting Standards Board will be involved in setting up the
working party.
Mr Jenkins complained that, in the accounts of many of the largest listed
companies, reports on corporate treasury matters are 'minimal in most
cases', even though the Report and Accounts is the correct medium for such
disclosure.
Only a few UK companies, including RTZ and Courtaulds, describe their
Treasury activities, including interest rate and currency exposure
management policies, in any detail.
Mr Jenkins suggested that companies' audit committees should monitor systems
of risk control and ensure that internal control systems are adequate. He
also emphasised that a clear view of the strategic aims of the Treasury
function was vital.
Mr Jenkins added that corporate treasury departments should not be treated
as profit centres. 'Value can certainly be added, but treasurers should work
to facilitate their companies' core business activities,' he said.

The refusal of the central bank to introduce instruments to hedge the lira,

FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: No time to jump ship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDZARD REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The project for European integration has ground to a halt. That is the sober
view we must take of the impasse on the Maastricht treaty.
No one regrets this state of affairs more than Daimler-Benz, a German
company with up to one-fifth of its turnover in fellow European Community
states. We, along with 340m fellow Europeans, were looking forward to the
creation of a single, tariff-free European market on January 1 1993. But
now, less then three months before that historic date, one of the decisive
conditions for a prosperous economic area - the creation of a single
European currency - is on the verge of failure. These and other pan-European
aims are now in danger of drowning in a sea of Euro-pessimism.
For Daimler-Benz, the economic integration of nations in Europe has always
been the best guarantor of peace. Yet are the destructive effects of Black
Wednesday, when the UK was forced out of the European exchange rate
mechanism, to be allowed to render obsolete long-standing enthusiasm for
European integration? Admit-tedly the Danes' rejection of Maastricht and
France's grudging support for it are a signal that their ideal of a single
Europe is not the one to be found in the Maastricht treaty.
Throughout Europe, the treaty's shortcomings, which politicians have ignored
for so long, are being brought to the surface. The result is that jumping
off the Euro-train is beginning to sound increasingly plausible. But this
should be resisted. The only alternative is a futile go-it-alone policy
among individual nations.
Those who criticise the ERM, for instance, seem to ignore the fact that for
12 years before Black Wednesday the ERM rewarded its members with stable
exchange rates, resulting in economic convergence and lower inflation.
The fact that the ERM partially foundered on September 16 is not to be laid
at the door of the mechanism itself. The onerous financial costs of German
unification, for instance, placed enormous strain on the ERM. In any event,
co-ordinated exchange rates can only work if they are adapted to economic
realities.
The temporary withdrawal of sterling and the lira from the ERM has dealt
European integration a massive blow. And yet UK Prime Minister John Major's
stated intention of installing Britain at the heart of Europe has long since
become economic reality; 60 per cent of UK foreign trade takes place within
the EC.
Daimler-Benz employs about 2,000 people in the UK. Annual turnover totals
DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.28bn). Daimler-Benz shares are listed on the London Stock
Exchange - the most international of all stock exchanges. Against this
backdrop, tension between European partners does not shake our resolve. The
way we see it, we have long since become a partner to the British economy.
There is no better illustration of this than the co-operation between
Daimler-Benz and BAe in the Airbus consortium.
But more important for Europe than sterling's re-entry into the ERM is to
have Britain as a political ally in the drive towards European unity. Many
Britons still regard Europe as uncharted political territory. But with their
self-confidence as a former global power, the British are a model for the
continent. Many self-appointed Euro-strategists have a lot to learn from the
British view that Europe must play its part in international crisis
management. British advocacy of the principle of subsidiarity must remain a
count-erweight to the centralising magnet of the Brussels bur-eaucracy.
The other 11 EC members could have saved themselves several disappointments
if they had debated the repercussions of monetary and political convergence
with the same vehemence as did the British. Their naive visions of harmony
have been rudely shattered. It would be fatal to attempt to overcome
momentary weakness by a wait-and-see policy, just as fatal as the sceptics'
proposal to use the European crisis as a reason to abandon ship.
A 'little Europe on the Rhine', in which half a dozen EC members hare off
alone, would be the worst option, for the stability of this inner core would
be gained at the expense of those who remain outside.
The UK, current holder of the European presidency, faces a task of historic
proportions. The irrational flight from shared responsibility has to be
stopped by offering constructive reform proposals. Whitehall has shown that
faded illusions can only be replaced by concepts of realistic substance. It
is in this spirit that the EC partners must work to develop their blueprint.
Now is the time to shape the future if we are to win the day. Otherwise we
shall have to admit defeat.

FT  16 OCT 92 / People: Splitting the roles at Westbury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the same week as launching the ProShare campaign for wider share
ownership, Geoffrey Maddrell has accepted an invitation to become
non-executive chairman of Westbury. The Cheltenham-based housebuilder is
also bringing in John Bennett, previously finance director of CHB Group, as
finance director in advance of the retirement of Barrie Hall.
Richard Fraser had combined the roles of chairman and chief executive for
the past three years, although Westbury, a 1985 management buy-out company,
had had a non-executive chairman for a spell after its stock market
flotation in 1986.
Fraser had, however, indicated in May that he wished to bring in an outside
chairman - partly a reflection of shareholders' general preference for
splitting the roles, partly because market conditions demanded more of his
time.
Maddrell, 56, ex-Tootal boss, and now chief executive of ProShare, has
recently been appointed a civil service commissioner, and is a director of
the Transport Development Group. Stressing that he will make sure most of
his time is spent on the ProShare endeavour, he adds that 'it is important
for me to keep up with what is going on in industry'.
As for the choice of Westbury, he thinks he can have a useful strategic
input. 'I know from the textiles business you can be very successful in
tough markets if you stick to your knitting.'
Bennett, 44, who had also been on the main board of Beazer, left in July. He
had been preparing the flotation of CHB last autumn when Hanson snapped up
Beazer. Hall, 57, says he has known Bennett for several years, though was
unaware he was looking for another job until Bennett replied to a newspaper
advert describing the opening.
Bennett takes up his position in November - but Hall stays on until the end
of the financial year next February in his other roles of company secretary
and IT director.
Hall has been with Westbury for some 13 years - and says the MBO was his
brainchild. He had intended to take early retirement at 55, but at that
stage the housing market had 'just started on the downhill slope. Now I can
put my hand on my heart and say I am leaving a firm that has a very strong
balance sheet and is operating profitably.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Community, in spite of the peace, stability and prosperity
which it has given to all of its members, is repeatedly called into
question. The special European Council meeting in Birmingham today will have
as its main theme the principle of subsidiarity. According to this
principle, decisions must be taken as closely as possible to the citizen.
The EC should act only when individual and separate action is not
sufficient.
The principle is one which has been followed for years in the area of EC
legislation that I know best - the environment - and rational and ordered
discussion of it is something that the European Commission should, and does,
welcome. But there are signs that the subsidiarity argument is being used as
a smoke screen for another, more sinister, purpose.
In France, Germany, Britain and elsewhere political figures such as
President Francois Mitterrand, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister
John Major are rounding on the Commission, in public at least, in their
search for a scapegoat. They are seeking to blame the Commission for the
apparent gulf that has appeared, in virtually all member states of the EC,
between the elected politicians and their electorates. The real aim is to
weaken the Commission and thus slow moves towards the union to which they
all profess to aspire.
Of course, these attacks are nothing new. The Commission is used to
accusations of being a bloated, centralised, power-hungry bureaucracy. These
tend to occur especially at times of economic difficulty or recession, as is
now the case.
A dispassionate examination of the facts shows that such an argument does
not hold water.
The Commission employs some 14,000 civil servants, fewer than the city of
Birmingham or Edinburgh, both of which are hosting European Council meetings
this year. Many of the Commission's staff are employed in the linguistic
service as translators and interpreters.
Moreover, the Commission does not have direct legislative powers. European
laws are not adopted by the Commission but by the Council of Ministers which
is formed of the ministers of the democratically elected governments of the
member states.
The Commission does have the exclusive right to propose legislation but that
power, important as it is, must be put in context. In 1991, only 6 per cent,
or 30 of the 535 proposals, were put forward by the Commission on its own
initiative; the others were the result of decisions already taken or
requests from ministers. This is hardly the conduct of an overweening
bureaucracy drunk with power.
Nor is that image of the Commission confirmed if we look at the way in which
it drafts its proposals. In the first place large numbers of experts from
national civil services on detachment to the Commission work side by side
with permanent EC officials on the drafting of proposals. At each stage of
the preparation drafts are discussed, not only with the sectors concerned
(industry, consumers and so on), but also with working groups composed of
experts from all the national civil services.
The politicians seeking to denigrate the Commission today know this, but
prefer to indulge in these tactics rather than explain the benefits which
for more than 30 years the EC has brought to its member states.
They know that, without the Commission, an EC made up of states so diverse
in size, in history and in culture would have been impossible. They know
that an independent Commission guarantees the necessary impartiality between
the states both in proposed legislation and in the application thereof. They
know that the one thing that the Maastricht treaty does not do is to
increase the powers of the Commission. The democratically elected parliament
and the council of elected ministers alone emerge with enhanced powers.
Why then do the critics persist? Are they afraid of the truth? Or are they
trying to hide their own weaknesses resulting from too long a period in
power or from party or coalition problems?
Europe's people are sending a clear message to their political leaders but,
as yet, they are not receiving a clear reply. Of course, the EC must be more
open, more accountable - but the true nature and benefits of the EC must be
painstakingly explained to its citizens.
That is what the politicians should be doing, rather than reacting with
ill-judged and false accusations, with which they hope to pacify those
fanatics who would seek to haul Europe back into the past and destroy the
achievements of the past 40 years.

<TEXT>
It is easy to feel dismay about the Maastricht debate. For two issues -
national sovereignty and representative government - have become hopelessly
embroiled and must be separated if we are to think clearly about the pros
and cons of the treaty.
Representative government can exist when sovereign rights are united (as in
the UK) or when they are divided (as in US federalism). But neither form of
the state guarantees representative government.
The middle ground of British opinion - including both those who reluctantly
feel it is best to ratify Maastricht and those who unhappily conclude it
should be rejected - is chiefly concerned with the latter issue. Those who
reluctantly support ratification fear that they may be sacrificing
self-government to the development of the Community, while those who oppose
ratification fear that their concern with self-government may be
misunderstood as blind nationalism, as turning away from Europe on the
simplistic ground of preserving national sovereignty. And both sections of
middling opinion are right to fear what they fear.
The future of representative government in a more unified Europe ought now
to be the central issue. Until the 18th century it was an axiom of European
political thought that the larger the political unit, the more likely it was
to be governed despotically. Only with the help, first of the British model
of government and then of American federalism, was that axiom partially
revised by liberal constitutional theory. But that does not mean that the
causes which had previously led thinkers to take such a dim view of the
prospects of self-government outside small communities ceased to operate.
Yet in recent decades politicians have become almost cavalier about the
political or constitutional dimension of the European Community. Take, for
example, the casual way in which the population of eastern Germany was
absorbed. For 60 years some 17m people there had been subject to despotic
government, first of the right and then of the left. Can anyone doubt that
habits and attitudes formed under such regimes survive, or that an education
in representative government and constitutional issues is required to root
out authoritarian attitudes? Rostock provides a warning.
Sadly, French leaders have concluded that the best response is to 'bind'
Germany to the rest of Europe by imposing a centralised decision-making
authority which resembles nothing so much as the French state. Doubtless the
French hope that such a structure will preserve their de facto domination of
the Community, despite the increased size and economic power of Germany. It
was the urgency of this French design which led to the Maastricht treaty,
which does not begin to address constitutional issues squarely.
Such issues were scarcely identified, let alone addressed, by European
leaders at Maastricht. Why not? Since the second world war, the language of
economics has driven out the language of politics and particularly the
language of constitutionalism. Yet the latter was the great achievement of
liberal thought in the 18th and 19th century, and it was directed especially
at one problem - how authority and power can be dispersed in a political
system so that tyranny is prevented, without making efficient and just
government impossible.
The pursuit of economic integration in Europe has resulted in a curious
outcome. A Community inspired by liberal democratic principles has
increasingly acted on quasi-Marxist assumptions - assuming that when
economic progress had been achieved, other institutional improvements would
follow inevitably or as a matter of course. But that is a form of economic
determinism which has been discredited intellectually and practically.
Nothing reflects this dominance of economic over political language more
than the hasty, last-minute assertion of the 'subsidiarity' principle. For
what does subsidiarity mean? Is it a political principle  - in which case it
acts merely as camouflage for a free-for-all in which the outcome is by
definition compatible with the subsidiarity principle, since there are no
clear criteria governing the distribution of power? Or is it a
constitutional and juridical principle?
But if it is the latter, then subsidiarity implies a movement towards a
federal Europe, with an agency - presumably the European Court - being
vested with the right to settle conflicts of jurisdiction and create spheres
of authority. And if so, what are the terms of reference for the Court, what
normative framework will guide its decisions and serve to legitimate them?
And are those terms adequate?
It was the thrust of liberal constitutional theory in the 18th and 19th
centuries to consider and deepen our understanding of such questions. Its
most celebrated principles - the separation of powers, entrenched rights and
forms of federalism - were means to that end. To suppose that a quick tour
around European capitals to reach a consensus on 'how subsidiarity works' is
now enough represents an intellectual regression which could have dreadful
practical consequences in the long run.
It is shaming for Europe in the 1990s that when its leaders meet to discuss
the shape of the future EC they do not begin to match the vision of those
who drafted the US Constitution in the late 1780s. Where are our Madisons,
Hamiltons and Jeffersons? If the language in which the EC identifies and
creates itself becomes largely economic, then the prospects for
self-government in Europe are grim.

LOCKHEED, the US defence group, yesterday reported net earnings of Dollars

81m, or Dollars 1.28, in the same period of 1991, writes Martin Dickson.
Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman, attributed the increase mainly to higher
programme profits in the aeronautical and electronics sectors. Sales were
Dollars 2.5bn, against Dollars 2.4bn.
Nine-months earnings totalled Dollars 229m, or Dollars 3.69 a share, on
sales of Dollars 7.2bn, up from earnings of Dollars 205m or Dollars 3.23 on
sales of Dollars 7.1bn.

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: More job losses expected at GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Stempel, chairman of General Motors, who fell ill from high blood
pressure on Tuesday, was released from a Washington hospital yesterday, amid
reports of fresh negotiations on job cuts between GM and the United Auto
Workers union.
The company, trying to return its loss-making North American operations to
profit, plans to cut at least 54,000 blue collar jobs over the next few
years and has run into strong UAW opposition.
However, the Detroit News newspaper reported yesterday that talks had begun
between the two sides on new early retirement incentives for blue collar
workers. Both GM and the UAW declined to comment.
GM's workforce is relatively old and stronger early retirement incentives
could significantly aid its job reduction programme. The Detroit News quoted
company and union insiders as saying plans included allowing some senior
workers to retire early with full pension and health benefits, while others
would be offered cash incentives.
Such a scheme could also relieve pressure on a Dollars 4bn fund set up by GM
under its 1990 three-year wage pact which guarantees laid off workers
virtual full pay indefinitely. However, the fund is now much depleted.
GM has faced two strikes over job cuts at parts plants in the last two
months.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit agency, said yesterday its ratings of GM's
debt could be lowered by mid-1993 if there were no clear signs of a
turnround in the performance of GM's automotive operations.
It said labour problems could intensify ahead of next year's contract talks,
adding that if there were further falls in GM's vehicle market share, 'even
the sweeping programme of plant closings announced last year may not be
adequate to achieve a satisfactory capacity utilisation rate'.

FT  16 OCT 92 / SEC rules on access to executive pay data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday voted for a
package of reforms aimed at boosting shareholder democracy and placing curbs
on the expanding pay packages of some company executives.
The new rules will require companies to provide clear and understandable
comparisons of their top executives' pay packages, including bonuses and
share or option rights, as well as of their own stock price performance.
Mr Richard Breeden, SEC chairman, said this would allow shareholders to
decide on fair pay for their executives, rather than have the government set
rigid rules.
'Armed with information, and empowered to act on that information, market
forces should hopefully restore a better sense of balance to America's board
rooms,' Mr Breeden said.
At the same time, the SEC voted to remove some of the restrictions now
imposed on shareholders who want to meet or write to their fellow
shareholders. This change is expected to make it easier for dissidents to
challenge a company's board of directors on policy issues or to stand for
election themselves.
At present, shareholders have to notify the SEC if they meet more than ten
other shareholders, and have to obtain commission approval in advance of any
written material they might circulate.
This year, the SEC responded to a wave of anger about bloated pay for
executives - critics were charging that this continued to rise even though
their companies' performance had plunged - by ruling that the subject was a
'significant policy issue'. This meant that companies would no longer be
allowed routinely to exclude shareholder motions on pay from the list of
resolutions put to annual meetings.

The Russian government has lifted travel restrictions on all foreigners, in

A government spokesman said yesterday that business people and journalists
will no longer need to give advance notice of travel plans, once they have a
visa to enter the country. They will also no longer need to show visas to
buy tickets and book accommodation, and can do this through private
organisations, by-passing traditional state monopoly organisations such as

FT  16 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities bombarded with bad news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK equity market bombarded with bad news at home and from abroad came
under more heavy selling pressure yesterday, as sterling fell sharply
against the D-mark and the dollar.
The strong gains in blue chip shares recorded on Monday and Tuesday, when
the move to cut mortgage rates by Abbey National was interpreted by dealers
as presaging a UK interest rate cut, have now been wiped out. Similar hopes
of imminent interest rate reductions by the German Bundesbank and the US
Federal Reserve have also perished.
There was unmitigated gloom around the City's trading rooms from the outset
as the Conservative government was taken to task by the Press over worsening
economic news and its handling of the massive job losses in coal mining.
Worse was to come with news of the latest jobless figures, which showed
unemployment in the UK running at 10.1 per cent in September, up for the
twenty-ninth consecutive month, with male unemployment of 13.4 per cent, the
highest since the 1930s.
The Footsie 100 began the session over 22 points down at 2,552.3, as
marketmakers chopped their opening levels to deter sellers. The move proved
reasonably successful with the index holding around the level until the
unemployment, unit wage costs and average earnings numbers were announced.
These figures, confirming recent bad news on the UK economy, touched off a
further flurry of selling pressure which drove the index down to 2,536.6,
for a fall of 38.1.
Wall Street's opening brought no respite for London with the US market down
some 15 points soon after trading commenced, following an extremely cautious
statement on prospects from Philip Morris, the US foods-to-tobacco giant.
BAT Industries' shares immediately tumbled in sympathy with Philip Morris
but ended the session well above the day's lowest levels.
Towards the close, however, London stabilised and managed to edge off the
bottom with the Footsie 100 closing a net 28.1 lower at 2,546.6. The Footsie
Mid 250 index lost 27.1 to 2,373.9 and the Footsie 350 index 13.6 to
1,223.4.
One senior trader at one UK securities house said the market would have
fallen further and faster had it not been for a number of short positions
and persistent stories of possible takeover bids. But he was extremely wary
of the equity market in the run up to the US Presidential election on
November 3.
Another specialist, whilst not seeing much upside scope, felt the downside
was also limited, saying: 'There are plenty of buyers of the market around
2,500.' Turnover of 476.8m shares remained disappointing.
The absence of the much-hoped for interest rate cut cast a shadow over a
building sector badly in need of support. Banks were exceptionally weak as
fears of a 'double-dip' recession prompted renewed concerns of more bad debt
provisioning. Utilities, traditionally good buys for their defensive
qualities when the cyclical stocks come under pressure, performed well with
water stocks particularly firm after their responses to the industry
watchdog proposals on cuts in water charges.

FT  16 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS reported another reasonably quiet trading session in the derivatives
markets, writes Steve Thompson.
In stock index futures, the December contract opened lower at 2,585,
weakened by worries about the latest decline in sterling and deepening
economic gloom, before edging ahead to the day's high of 2,603 in
mid-morning. Thereafter, it declined steadily, eventually touching what
proved to be the day's low point of 2,570 just as Wall Street opened.
However, a gentle squeeze developed as the market close loomed, taking the
future up to a final 2,590, some 11 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of around 32 points. Turnover in the December was 7,092
contracts, compared with Wednesday's 6,651 contracts.
Dealers expect substantial activity prior to the expiry at 10.30am today of
the October FT-SE Index option in which there is sizeable open interest in
the 2,500 and 2,550 calls.
News that Moody's, the US credit-rating agency, had put Barclays and NatWest
on 'credit-watch' put considerable pressure on the underlying share prices
and triggered a flurry of activity in Barclays options where 2,415 contracts
were traded.
Otherwise there was disappointingly low activity in stock options. British
Gas also attracted plenty of interest after switching activity in the
underlying stock, with 1,507 contracts traded.

FT  16 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Switch advice hits Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL news and information group Reuters Holdings fell sharply at
the start of trading as the full effect of a cautious recommendation hit the
market. The shares opened 22 down and were 33 off at worst as investors
digested a recommendation by investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd that
they switch out of the stock and into SmithKline Beecham.
BZW lowered its stance on the stock, arguing that at close of trading on
Wednesday the shares had 'moved into the stratosphere with the likes of
Glaxo, Wellcome and Rentokil' and hit a 50 per cent premium rating to the
market.
A BZW salesman advised yesterday: 'If you want quality, buy SmithKline,
which we think is offering better earnings prospects on a lower rating.'
There was also some disappointment filtering through from a presentation in
New York on the prospects for Reuters new electronics dealing system,
Globex. Globex is a small part of Reuters' revenue, but forecasts for its
generative potential may have to be scaled back.
By the close, Reuters had fallen 29 to 1225p, while SmithKline had risen 4
1/2 p to 517p in the 'A' shares and 4 to 455p in the Units.
Pilkington eases
A second day's heavy trading in Pilkington saw the rise in the share price
of the last several days ease as the keen US buying interest was met with
equal selling needs by UK institutions. Although the large turnover in
Pilkington - 16m on Wednesday and a further 16.5m yesterday - alerted
dealers to renewed bid rumours about the troubled glassmaker, seasoned
brokers were dismissive, arguing that UK fund managers would be loath to
bail out prior to a bid. They also pointed out that both Chase Manhattan
Bank and Fidelity Corporation had this week raised their stakes in
Pilkington and that yesterday's activity hinted at further buying by the two
big US institutions.
However, Pilkington, badly hit by poor trading, has long been touted as a
potential bid target and talk of stake building refused to die away
yesterday. Old favourites like Pittsburgh Plate and Glass (PPG) and French
group Saint Gobain were among those being fingered. The shares declined 2 to
83p.
Waters firm
Water stocks reflected a rare oasis of optimism as the market considered
their responses to price-cutting threats by the official regulator Ofwat.
The most volatility among big league water groups surfaced in North West,
which was twice down more than 6p but rallied each time and closed a net 3
firmer at 437p. The bear case that North West could be the hardest hit by
enforced price cuts and uncertainty over the company's position is expected
to continue until a decision is reached in December.
However, some analysts were saying that, partly because the region contains
the most polluted beaches in the country, the company faces a charge of some
Pounds 430m as a result of tighter environmental controls and this high
figure should justify more government grants.
Anglian and Wessex were steadier as it was seen that the effect on their
profits by any regulatory moves would be minimal - less than 1.5 per cent in
the case of the former and 1 per cent in the case of Wessex. Ms Rachel Lucas
at County NatWest was preparing a buy note on the sector yesterday. She
said: 'It is safe to buy the water stocks ahead of results at the start of
November. Anglian and Southern are particularly attractive and if North West
suffers substantially we would recommend it.'
Cable manufacturer BICC fell back heavily after a large placing, the shares
tumbling 19 to 221p. Broking house Smith New Court bought 5m shares at 213p
and placed them at 218p a share. Traders said that the placing was the
latest of several large lines of BICC stock on offer in recent weeks, due to
institutions apparently being increasingly nervous over the group's
involvement in the Channel Tunnel and the negotiations with Eurotunnel over
costings.
There are also increasing worries over the safety of BICC's dividend.
Turnover was 12m, making it the second most heavily-traded stock of the day.
TV group Thames continued its sharp recovery, rising a further 13 to 181p, a
gain of 45p since the start of the month. Analysts said the group had
attracted the interest of US fund managers who look at the relationship
between the market capitalisation and the asset value.
Oil group Enterprise slipped 10 to 423p on concerns over its Pounds 95m
issue of new shares, which are to be traded as American Depositary Receipts
on the New York stock exchange.
Shell Transport gained 4 to 522p and British Gas fell 5 to 255p. Some
dealers were talking of a switch from Gas to Shell but there was also a
feeling that a big switch the other way round had been unwound and the
buying of Gas was now looking overdone.
Bank stocks were weak as the market registered disappointment at the fading
hopes of an interest rate cut. Barclays was particularly badly hit, losing
17 to 338p on heavy turnover of 10m shares. The shares also received a kick
from news that Moody's Investors Service might cut the bank's long-term debt
ratings. National Westminster also attracted the threat of a Moody's
downgrade and fell 12 to 339p.
The relative attractions of Far Eastern investment helped Hongkong Shanghai
Banking Corp rise 7 to 444p and Standard Chartered gain 13 to 490p.
Regional brewers bore the brunt of the selling in the drinks sector as fears
grew that colliery closures would hit sales, with Greenalls retreating 8 to
363p, Wolverhampton and Dudley 15 to 514p and Scottish and Newcastle 8 to
398p.
Grand Metropolitan was one of the brighter lights in the sector, adding 5 to
382p. US buying has buoyed the stock up in recent sessions and yesterday
US-owned broker Merrill Lynch moved from neutral to buy.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries suffered after
disappointment with figures from US group Philip Morris, particularly its
falling cigarette shipments. BATs were down by more than 40 at one stage and
closed 19 off at 823p.
The market gave a decisive thumbs down to the long-awaited board changes at
Forte, the shares diving 9 to 141p in chunky turnover of 2.2m.
Not everyone in the market liked the disposal and acquisition by
pharmaceuticals group Medeva. Some said it had sold its basic generic
products at too great a loss and paid over the odds for Armstrong
Pharmaceuticals, a US developer and manufacturer of therapeutic drugs.
However, others like Goldman Sachs, were positive and suggested yesterday's
share price fall of 13 to 180p was more representative of the possible
overhang of shares. Medeva is to issue 16m new shares to fund the US
purchase.
Slack European soft drinks volumes from Coca Cola hit Cadbury-Schweppes, the
shares falling 10 to 429p.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Rate signals ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING cash and futures markets remained bullish about the prospects for a
cut in UK base rates, despite the Bundesbank's decision not to alter
official rates at its council meeting yesterday, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank decision had been priced into the market earlier in the week,
but the news still affected European markets. The December Euromark contract
fell 7 basis points from its opening level, to a low of 91.57, recovering
later to 91.64. It priced in a 60 basis point reduction in the cost of three
month
D-Marks before the end of the year.
Sterling cash and futures markets were even more ebullient, however, despite
plenty of official indications that no rate change is forthcoming.
The Bundesbank's decision alone should have depressed sterling markets. So
should the Bank of England's recent signals that near-term credit policy
will remain unchanged. The chancellor also emphasised on Monday that the
exchange rate must be supported to reduce inflation.
However, the December short sterling contract rose 19 basis points to a
close of 92.04 yesterday, implying that base rates will be at 8 per cent or
less before the end of the year. Three-month sterling cash closed unchanged
at around 8 5/8 per cent. One-year money closed a full percentage point
below base rate, at around 8 per cent. One discount house trader said this
was the first time he could remember seeing the 'one year' so cheap compared
to such a high base rate.
These prices reflect a growing belief that the government will not hold to a
tight credit policy for long. Yesterday's jobless figures, showing a 5-year
high of 2.84 million unemployed, will put pressure on the government to cut
rates. 'Whatever the Bank of England does can still be trumped by the
government,' said one discount house dealer.
The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn and purchased Pounds 36m of
Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 16m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, and
Pounds 25m in a repurchase agreement ('repo') at 8 15/16 per cent. In
further operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 410m of Band 1 bank bills and
Pounds 651m in a 'repo'. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 51m in
Band 1 bank bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 30m.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound down on economy fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling fell nearly four pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as investors
became increasingly concerned about Britain's deteriorating economic
situation, writes James Blitz.
The pound, like other currencies, weakened against the D-Mark after the
Bundesbank decided not to alter its official rates at yesterday's
fortnightly council meeting. But sterling's fall was mostly the result of
bad economic news, including yesterday's rise in unemployment by 32,200 in
September and the impact of the recent decision to close most of Britain's
coal mining industry.
The UK appears to be entering a new economic downturn and this has weakened
the currency by 8 pfennigs in the last four days. The pound was at a high of
DM2.54 on Monday, at a low of DM2.4579 in European trading yesterday, and
closed in London at DM2.4620.
At the height of the sterling crisis, investors were concerned that the
pound was not supported by higher short-term interest rates. Mr David
Cocker, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, believes that the markets
are now placing a greater premium on a need to cut interest rates and boost
economic growth. 'Sterling would dip 4 or 5 pfennigs on the back of a rate
cut,' he says. 'But that would be it. The fall would be followed by good
buying.'
Mr Ifty Islam, a currency economist at BZW in London, disagrees. In his
view, the government would take a big risk cutting rates in the current,
highly nervous, climate. 'If the government had eased policy after
yesterday's unemployment figure, the market would have seen this as part of
a trend, pushing sterling towards DM2.30.'
A UK government's decision over whether to cut rates has political as well
as economic ramifications. A percentage point cut in UK base rate would take
it below Germany's discount rate of 8.25 per cent, establishing a very firm
break with German - and continental - policy at a time when the government
is trying to ratify the Maastricht treaty on European Union.
As Mr Cocker puts it: 'Norman Lamont would have to give up walking a
tightrope between two policies.'
The German central bank's decision depressed the dollar, pushing it about 1
1/2 pfennigs down on the day to a close in London of DM1.4470. September
consumer prices were also bearish for the US currency, showing a modest 0.2
per cent rise overall, and implying that inflationary factors would not
deter the Federal Reserve from easing interest rates.
However, the jobless claims for the week to October 3 fell to 383.000 from
399,000 the week before, slightly better than forecast. This underlined
perceptions that the Fed can afford to wait until after the US Presidential
election before easing policy.

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japanese bank closes Swiss
operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHUO TRUST and Banking, a leading Japanese trust bank, has closed its Zurich
subsidiary in response to poor trading conditions, and will concentrate its
European activities in London and Brussels.
Chuo is the third Japanese financial company, after Ryoko Securities and
Yamatane Securities, to shut its Zurich office this year. Japanese bankers
in the city say more could follow in the next few months.
Analysts say this is the inevitable crunch following an excessive build-up
in the late 1980s which saw the number of Japanese banks and securities
companies with offices in Switzerland exceed 40.
At the time, Zurich became an extension of the Japanese capital market, with
Japanese banks and securities companies helping Japanese industrial
companies float Swiss franc bond issues, usually equity-related. Interest
and exchange rates were such that funds raised, when converted into yen,
were very cheap to the issuers, occasionally even resulting in negative
interest charges.
Japanese new issue activity in Swiss capital markets remains surprisingly
strong. According to Yamaichi Bank (Switzerland), a subsidiary of Yamaichi
Securities, the total value of Japanese new bond issues launched in
Switzerland so far this year is SFr5.9bn, (Dollars 4.79bn) - ahead of the
pace of the past two years.
However, competition for this business is fierce. In the past, the Zurich
offices of Japanese banks and securities companies were able to make good
profits broking Japanese securities or in private banking, but these
activities have faded following the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble.
According to one Japanese banker in Zurich, none of their fraternity is
profitable today. Mr Hideaki Takimoto, liquidator of Chuo Trust Finance
(Switzerland), said the office, which opened only a little over four years
ago, had reached break-even level but the outlook did not look promising.
A key factor in the group's decision was a deadline for non-banks in
Switzerland to convert themselves into banks by the end of this year. That
would involve bringing more capital into the Zurich subsidiary, which Chuo
and others would rather avoid.
However, with the creation of the single market in the European economic
area next year, Chuo's office in Brussels, which has a banking licence, will
be able to participate in syndicating Swiss bond issues.

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Krups purchase puts Moulinex in
the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOULINEX, the French household electronics group, fell into the red in the
first half of the year because of the economic slowdown and the financial
impact of its acquisition of Krups of Germany.
The group slipped from net profits of FFr35m in the first six months of 1991
to a net loss of FFr11m (Dollars 2.30m) this year, on turnover which rose
slightly from FFr3.67bn to FFr3.7bn. Operating profits fell from FFr213m to
FFr171m.
A similar sluggish trend recurred in the third quarter of the year, with
turnover rising slowly from FFr5.51bn to FFr5.54bn in the nine months to
September 30.
Moulinex acquired Krups last year for DM130m (Dollars 92.10m) in an attempt
to diversify its interests. Krups specialises in coffee machines and
electric mixers; Moulinex is stronger in microwave ovens and food
processors.
Moulinex said it planned to continue its investment programme for its
production plants in Europe, Egypt and Mexico.
Thomson, the French electronics group, is strengthening its presence in
household electronics by taking full control of the domestic appliances
division of De Dietrich, another French electronics concern. Thomson has for
the past 18 months held 50 per cent of De Dietrich.

SEMI-Tech (Global), the Hong Kong owner of the Singer sewing machine group,
announced net profits of HKDollars 704m (USDollars 91m) for the six months
ended July 1992, a 210 per cent increase on the comparable period of last
year.
Earnings were boosted by the HKDollars 526m exceptional profit from the sale
of 8m shares in New York-listed Singer. On a recurring and comparable basis
 -assuming the same percentage contribution from Singer - profits would have
risen 17 per cent.
Turnover increased to HKDollars 4.7bn from HKDollars 4.5bn. Its 51 per
cent-owned subsidiary, Singer, has successfully expanded its product range
from sewing machines into consumer durables, resulting in sales growth in
the majority of its markets.
Semi-Tech is starting to focus on mainland China for expansion. Singer has
formed a joint venture in Shanghai to manufacture sewing machines for the
local market, while its parent is setting up a retail network to distribute
its products in the world's largest consumer market.
The directors recommended an interim dividend of HKDollars 0.23, up from
HKDollars 0.20 in 1991.

ownership

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT change in ownership of GiroCredit Bank, Austria's
third-largest bank, is in prospect following a truce among feuding camps at
the group's board meeting in Vienna yesterday.
Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chief executive of Bank Austria, and Mr Konrad Fuchs,
chief executive of Die Erste Osterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank, announced
following the meeting that talks would begin immediately aimed at achieving
a change in the shareholding structure by next April.
Bank Austria and Die Erste together hold a majority of Giro shares, a
situation Giro management considers intolerable because the two are also
important competitors.
Mr Haiden said yesterday that there should be one clear source of
decision-making.
Giro management, which is seeking to secure a retail base for itself, eased
the tension before the meeting by shelving proposals to buy minority share
stakes in savings banks in Salzburg and Linz.
These had been opposed by Bank Austria and Die Erste as an inefficient use
of capital.
Giro feared its two largest shareholders were trying to crowd it out of the
retail market. But Mr Haiden and Mr Fuchs acknowledged yesterday that Giro
had a dual function - as a partner of the savings banks and as a specialised
universal bank. 'It has to fulfil a function in the retail market,' Mr
Haiden said.
'We are all very pleased,' a Giro spokesman said following the meeting.
Giro management has been trying to entice Bayerische
Landesbank-Girozentrale, the German bank, to buy a large minority
shareholding, but Bayerische has said it will not make a decision until
Giro's relations with its two largest shareholders are sorted out.
A year ago, negotiations aimed at merging Die Erste, which operates a
network of savings banks, and Giro collapsed in acrimony.

FT  16 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: French confirm ban on current
account interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICHEL SAPIN, the French finance minister, yesterday confirmed his decision
to forbid the use of interest-paying cheque accounts in France.
'At present we have a balanced situation whereby account-holders do not
receive interest on their balances, but do not have to pay for their current
accounts,' said Mr Sapin. 'I am absolutely committed to ensuring that
everyone continues to have the right to a free bank account.'
The question of whether banks in France should be allowed to break with
tradition by paying interest on current accounts has long been a source of
controversy. The banking establishment, led by the Association Francaise des
Banques, has lobbied strongly against such a change.
The issue came to a head earlier this week when Mr Sapin amended French
banking regulations to ban an interest-paying account introduced late last
month by the French subsidiary of Barclays Bank, the UK banking group.
Similar accounts were available in France before the Barclays launch,
including products from the Assurances Generales de France and Victoire
insurance groups. But the Barclays account, which was heavily promoted, was
seen by the authorities as a direct threat to the status quo.
Barclays has said it will find a legal way around the new regulations. The
rumpus over its account comes shortly after a similar controversy when the
French post office was forced to withdraw a new interest-paying cheque
account.
The tradition of 'free' current accounts stems from close links between the
government and France's big banks, which have historically been
state-controlled. However, it is also in the interest of France's big banks
to maintain the status quo, because it is more difficult for newcomers to
break into the market if they cannot offer interest on accounts.
French banking margins are under pressure because of the competitive state
of the domestic market and the impact of economic slowdown.

US invasion

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH yesterday of the FT-SE 100 index on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, and a corresponding option contract on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, is the first wave of a friendly invasion of the US by
European-based index futures products.
US investors are increasingly buying foreign equities, a trend that US
futures exchanges have been quick to capitalise on in their scramble to
diversify and maintain their share of global financial trade.
The New York-based Comex will begin trading futures on the European Options
Exchange's index of most actively-traded European stocks, the Eurotop 100,
on October 26, with the American Stock Exchange offering options on the
index.
US exchanges are also eyeing Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40, waiting for
trading and regulatory climates to ripen to a point where US-based contracts
will be feasible.
The success of US derivatives on foreign markets will depend on whether
institutional investors find them more profitable to trade than home-based
varieties.
US futures exchanges are betting that fund managers will be attracted by
their lower costs, familiar trading hours, dollar-denomination, plus
familiar American regulations and settlement procedures.
Los Angeles-based TSA Capital Management, a consulting firm which advises
pension fund managers, says that less than 5 per cent of pension fund assets
are currently invested in foreign equities. Like others, he expects that to
rise to 15 to 20 per cent among more aggressive funds.
The US-based FT-SE 100 contracts will begin on a strong footing. The product
will be simultaneously available to the CME and CBOE.
In earlier editions yesterday, the FT-SE 100 index was wrongly described as
the FT-SE Eurotrack 100.

FT  16 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): IBM, Philip Morris lead Dow
into reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
APART FROM disappointing third quarter earnings from IBM and Philip Morris -
which contributed to a sizeable fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -
US stock markets were mostly flat yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20.80 at 3,174.68,
above its lows for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's
500, however, firmed 0.30 to 409.67, while the Amex composite ended just
0.54 lower at 365.63 and the Nasdaq composite rose 2.43 to 578.65. Turnover
on the NYSE was heavy at 205m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 879 to
805.
The Dow's decline was almost entirely due to losses in IBM and Philip
Morris, which were hit by poor quarterly results. According to Birinyi
Associates, the New York market analysis firm, all but a couple of points of
the decline in the Dow was due to the big losses in IBM and Philip Morris,
two of the largest constituents of the Dow.
Analysts said that the S &amp; P 500 and other secondary indices provided a
better measure of market performance, which suggested that despite some bad
corporate news the market was relatively stable.
The day's economic numbers were not particularly significant. A 16,000 drop
in weekly jobless claims and a 0.2 per cent increase in September consumer
prices were positive for the market, but were offset by a big fall in the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of local business activity and a
similar-sized decline in the ABC/Money Magazine index of consumer
confidence.
IBM dominated trading after the giant computer group reported third quarter
net income of 15 cents a share, well below the 75 cents a share forecast by
analysts. The news from IBM set off a stampede of selling, which delayed the
opening of trading in the stock for more than 30 minutes. After a hectic
day's trading, IBM shares eventually closed down Dollars 5 1/8 , or 6.5 per
cent, at Dollars 72 7/8 , the stock's lowest close for more than 10 years.
Turnover was 6.2m shares.
The day's other big story was Philip Morris, which plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to
Dollars 79 3/4 in turnover of 9.5m shares. Although the bottom line numbers
from the company were not so bad - a 16.4 per cent increase in after-tax
profits to Dollars 1.29bn - investors were disappointed by falling domestic
cigarette shipments and warnings from the company of a much larger fall to
come in the fourth quarter.
AMR, parent group of American Airlines, firmed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58
1/4 after the company announced plans to cut 1993 spending by Dollars 300m
and reduce payroll costs by 10 per cent through management job cuts.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended mixed in moderate dealings, held back by a slumping
real estate sector. The TSE 300 composite index gained 0.75 points, or 0.02
per cent, to 3,196.14, with declining issues outpacing gainers 297 to 211.
Volume was 23m shares valued at CDollars 252.1m against the previous 23.6m
valued at CDollars 215.6m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI ended higher as a rebound in stock index futures pulled the
market up in the final half hour of trading. Earlier in the session, buying
by investment trusts in a thin market helped to support share prices, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index advanced 284.46 to close at the day's high of 17,628.49,
after small-lot selling had taken it to a morning low of 17,309.83.
Volume fell to 180m shares from 253m, with arbitrageurs and investment
trusts the only notable participants of the day. Advances led declines by
529 to 404 with 163 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 7.75 to 1,326.65 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.55 to
1066.98.
Most investors continued to stay away from the market ahead of the corporate
results season in November. Early indications have come from leading
retailers, which have started to report interim figures to August; these
have been sluggish, due to the downturn in consumer spending.
Traders said that hopes of an imminent discount rate cut had receded.
Reports that the German Bundesbank would not hold a press conference after
its policy-making meeting yesterday were seen as an indication that it would
not make any important announcements, disappointing some investors.
Issues continued to be bought on the 'Interferon theme'. Inabata, the
trading company, which holds stake in the unlisted Sumitomo Pharmaceutical,
a leading manufacturer of Interferon, rose Y20 to Y1,160 on active trading.
Sumitomo Chemical, Sumitomo Pharmaceutical's parent company, advanced Y2 to
Y480.
Buying by public pension funds supported steel issues. Nippon Steel rose Y1
to Y296, while Kawasaki Steel also advanced Y1 to Y296.
Department stores were lower on an 8.7 per cent fall in September department
store sales in Tokyo. Tokyu Department Store fell Y3 to Y555 and Takashimaya
lost Y4 to Y838.
Banks lost ground with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y20 to Y2,520 and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank falling Y30 to Y1,580. Investors were discouraged by
comments from a finance ministry official ruling out preferential tax
treatment for the real estate purchasing body which will be set up by the
banks to buy up land collateral held by financial institutions.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 35.82 to 19,150.16 in volume of 18m shares.
Small-lot profit taking overwhelmed buying orders, with heavy falls in the
construction and pharmaceutical sectors.
Roundup
ALTHOUGH the region gave a mixed performance, there were indications in Hong
Kong and Taiwan that buyers were prepared to chase rising markets.
HONG KONG weighed the Sino-US trade talks success against China's latest
rejection of British proposals on financing of the planned new airport.
After a volatile day, strong overseas buying interest brushed aside local
profit-taking, and the Hang Seng index ended 106.87 higher at 5,913.64.
Turnover rose from HKDollars 2.41bn to HKDollars 3.88bn. Blue chips
dominated the day, with HSBC gaining another Dollars 1.50 to HKDollars 57.50
and China Light rising 75 cents to HKDollars 35.70.
TAIWAN rose 2.6 per cent on newspaper reports that the stock transaction tax
might be lowered. The weighted index closed 95.80 higher at 3,729.02 in
turnover up from TDollars 9.2bn to TDollars 23.4bn. Food, electronic, and
construction shares led the gains.
KUALA LUMPUR stayed busy, volume holding up at 110.5m shares against 117.0m
on Wednesday, but further selective buying alternated with bouts of
profit-taking, and the KLSE composite index closed just 0.82 higher at
607.38.
The newly-listed TH Loy topped the active list with 8.7m shares traded, and
closed at MDollars 2.70 for a premium of 50 cents over its offer price.
BANGKOK took profits on finance, securities and other smaller stocks bought
a day ago, and the SET index dropped 7.99 to 871.66 in moderate turnover of
Bt9.89bn. Declines led advances 161 to 73 with 45 shares unchanged.
MANILA sagged under Wall Street's overnight losses, the composite index
falling 18.47 to 1,368.34, largely on the New York fall in Philippine Long
Distance Telephone which lost 10 pesos to 935.00 at home.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index closed 14.7 down at 1439.0, driven down by
a combination of poor metal prices, a number of companies going ex-dividend,
and pressure from the futures markets.
News Corp was the highlight of the day, rising 2 cents to ADollars 24.12
after it successfully introduced 40m shares priced at Wednesday's close of
ADollars 24.10.

FT  16 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela shaken by right-wing violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political uncertainty caused by renewed violence prompted a heavy fall in
Venezuela's stock market last month, making it the worst performer in the
emerging markets table compiled by IFC, part of the World Bank.
The 21.7 per cent fall in dollar terms in Caracas more than wiped out the
9.9 per cent gain achieved in the relative calm of August. Mr Federico
Laffan, an analyst at Latin American Securities in London, says that the
emergence of a right-wing group which has started a violent campaign against
political figures accused of corruption has prompted investors to flee from
the stock market.
Higher interest rates linked to the introduction of new banking reserve
requirements and the resulting tightening of liquidity also prompted the
sell-off in equities. Overnight rates have gone as high as 700 per cent
while yields on zero-coupon bonds have risen by 370 basis points to 35.3 per
cent.
The central bank has contributed to the high overnight rates in an effort to
dampen domestic demand for dollars in the recent disturbances as well as to
relieve the downward pressure on the bolivar.
Although the Venezuelan stock market rebounded in the first week of October,
what was initially seen as an assassination attempt on President Carlos
Andres Perez earlier this week sent the market down again.
Mr Laffan says that the market is unlikely to recover in the short term. The
political situation remains difficult and the approach of municipal
elections at the start of December makes it unlikely that a badly needed tax
package will be passed by Congress.
By contrast, the elimination of political instability helped Thailand to
rise by 13.2 per cent in dollar terms in September. Foreign and local
investors were heartened by the formation of a coalition government under Mr
Chuan Leekpai, and daily turnover reached record levels of more than Bt20bn
(Dollars 793m).
Demand from foreign investors has caused the premium on some foreign-held
shares over locally-held shares to widen to as much as 16 per cent, from
around 5 per cent or even zero two months earlier.
The Thai stock market has now entered a period of consolidation after its
recent rally and daily turnover has dropped back to less than Bt10bn. But Mr
David Bates at Asia Equity expects the market to remain strong, saying that
its re-rating has only just begun.

FT  16 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses subdued by economic
outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH no surprises from the Bundesbank, bourses drifted lower again as they
considered the outlook for national economies and corporate profits, writes
Our Markets Staff.
At UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, economists updated their projections for Germany and
France. For the former, they said that interest rates will have to stay high
 -if not as high as they are now - to ease inflationary pressures on the
economy. For the latter, they forecast real GDP growth of just 1.1 per cent
in 1993 after 1.8 per cent this year.
Merrill Lynch economists expect more downgrades on the corporate front, and
that fundamental earnings estimates for next year reflected in August IBES
data are still 10 to 15 per cent too high. However, they say, a significant
portion of the downgrades has been discounted and markets could offer a 15
to 20 per cent upside on a 12-month view.
FRANKFURT ended little changed after the Bundesbank news with the DAX 5.10
lower at 1,453.43 and interest rate-sensitive bank shares were broadly
neutral.
Mr James Cornish, the County NatWest strategist, thinks that there is room
for improvement after a visit last week to the Bundesbank, which attached
considerable importance to the 'solidarity pact' which government, industry
and the unions are discussing, to place the financing of German unification
on a sounder footing.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, re-elected this week as leader of the IG Metall
engineering union, told the meeting which confirmed him that the union was
ready, subject to conditions, to accept that wages should rise no faster
than inflation over the next five years.
The Bundesbank contribution, says Mr Cornish, would have to be lower
interest rates, and he maintains his forecast of another cut in December.
Meanwhile, he says, County has built earnings reductions of 18 per cent into
a current p/e of 13.5 for the market. This compares with an average of 14.2
over the past five years, and on a yield basis the market is also cheaper
against bonds that it was six months ago.
PARIS lost 1.1 per cent, weighed down by the Bundesbank news and a lower
opening on Wall Street. The CAC-40 index fell 17.91 to 1,650.02 but turnover
was limited once again, at FFr1.5bn.
The biggest falls came in second-line stocks, with Accor dropping FFr44.10
or 8.4 per cent to FFr482.9 on rumours that a leading broker had issued a
negative report on the company.
Moulinex dropped FFr6.50 or 6.7 per cent to FFr90 on fears that it would
announce first half losses of between FFr30m and FFr40m. In the event,
Moulinex announced a deficit of FFr11m, and brokers expect the stock to
rebound today.
Among leading stocks, Euro Disney fell back FFr2.05 to FFr74.45 after its
recent rally while Saint-Gobain lost a further FFr15.40 to FFr466.60.
MILAN turned upwards after a weak start on renewed hopes of an early cut in
the discount rate. The hopes were fanned by news that the average rate at
the Bank of Italy's repurchase tender eased from 15.01 per cent to 14.98 per
cent, to stand just below the discount rate of 15 per cent.
However dealers said there was little logic to the rally, which was fuelled
by domestic buying while foreigners continued to stay away from Italian
equities. The Comit index rose 4.39 to 409.15 in turnover estimated at
L250bn after L225.6bn on Wednesday.
Shares in Italcementi shot up on hopes that the company and its parent,
Italmobiliare, would be compensated for any losses resulting from the
takeover of Ciments Francais. Italcementi rose L920 or 12.5 per cent to
L8,300 while Italmobiliare added L200 to L33,000. Trading in Italmobiliare
savings shares was suspended when they shot up to L14,900 in after-hours
trading, compared with an official fixing of L13,500, up L300. Trading in
the shares will resume today.
STOCKHOLM was pulled down by higher domestic interest rates and negative
impulses from abroad. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 12.6 to 662.3 in
turnover of SKr364m after SKr354m.
S-E Banken reported a a pre-tax loss of SKr2.61m in the first eight months,
but its C unrestricted shares added SKr0.50 to SKr13.
OSLO fell 2.2 per cent on the weaker dollar and disappointing results from
Kvaerner, the shipbuilding and engineering group. The all-share index closed
7.25 lower at 328.66 and Kvaerner A ended NKr8 down at NKr129.
Fine tuning was seen in VIENNA, where the ATX index closed up 0.97 at 779.7,
and in AMSTERDAM, where the CBS Tendency index lost 0.6 to 106.1. .

London COCOA rose sharply in early trade on news of an Ivorian decision to
ban purchases of mid-crop and sub-grade cocoa for the 1992-93 season. There
also appeared to be less prospect of the Ivory Coast selling cocoa around
current levels after its decision to keep its producer price for good cocoa
at 200 CFA francs a kg and a further fall in the value of sterling against
the French franc. News of a 9.2 per cent rise in the third-quarter Dutch
cocoa grind was seen as mildly supportive. GOLD was fixed little changed in
the afternoon from its four-week low morning fix on the London bullion
market. Trading was choppy after heavy Middle East selling. There seemed to
be one major player governing business after selling heavily into the
Australian market in early trade and then later into Europe, dealers said.
There were some producer sales; producers were unhappy to be selling, but
some needed to cover costs even though they were helping to drive the market
lower.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nafta redraws the American farm
trade map - The far-reaching effects of the agreement to phase out
protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE North American Free Trade Agreement goes into effect as planned in
1994 its provisions will have far-reaching effects on the region's
agriculture.
At this point, the continent's farm trade has been largely complementary.
The US and Canada export grains to Mexico, and Mexico supplies them with
tropical products, fruit and vegetables. This simple arrangement could
change over the next 15 years.
Unlike other parts of the agreement, the negotiators were unable to reach a
single farm trade accord for all three countries. The understanding between
Canada and Mexico calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff
barriers with the exception of those in the dairy, poultry, egg and sugar
sectors. Canada is expected to tackle its protected sectors within the farm
trade negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Canada will immediately exempt Mexico from import restrictions covering
wheat, barley, beef, veal and margarine. The two countries will eliminate
immediately or phase out within five years tariffs on many fruit and
vegetable products. Tariffs on remaining fruit and vegetable products will
be phased out over 10 years.
Between the US and Mexico a more extensive deal has been agreed. All
non-tariff measures affecting agricultural trade will be eliminated when
Nafta goes into effect. They will be converted into tariffs and phased out
over 15 years.
More than half of all farm trade between the US and Mexico will be
tariff-free immediately upon the start of the agreement. The US will use its
longest transition periods for sugar, certain fruits and vegetables and
orange juice. Mexico will use its longest for milk powder, maize and dry
beans.
American grain farmers are generally happy about the new market potential,
but the National Association of Wheat Growers is furious that the US
negotiators failed to convince Canada to make the workings of its wheat
board more transparent. Testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, the
president of the Wheat Growers, Mr Madison Angell, complained that Canada
currently controlled more than three quarters of the Mexican wheat market,
despite the geographical advantage enjoyed by the US.
'The reason for this abnormality,' he said, 'is that the US has been
unwilling to match subsidised competition. There is no indication that the
Bush administration will go head-to-head against the Canadians in the future
if the Nafta is implemented.'
All three countries have agreed to move towards domestic support policies
that are not trade-distorting. They have agreed to give notice of intent to
introduce a subsidy on farm exports to another Nafta country
Mr Angell called for price reporting by all exporting countries to a neutral
international body and requested US legislation requiring a system of end
use certificates specifying the name of the importer and the use to which
the grain would be put. This would preclude imported grain being re-exported
with the benefit of further subsidisation from the second country. Canada
already has an end use certification requirement on US grain.
Farm groups opposing the Nafta - and there are several - complain that one
of the worst loopholes in the agreement is the permission granted to Mexico
to import all or part of its domestic food needs from third countries. They
say Mexico would then be free to ship its domestic production to the US
duty-free.
They are particularly worried about meat. Although US negotiators say
American meat exports to Mexico will continue to rise, there is a great deal
of worry that agribusinesses will set up cattle ranches, run by cheap
labour, in Mexico to undercut US ranchers.
Cargill's Excel division - the second largest US meat packer - has already
begun to move production to a huge new plant in Saltillo, Mexico, and
expects to begin operations soon. The Institute of Agriculture and Trade
Policy said Mexico is already developing barter trades of oil for feedgrains
from Argentina, in anticipation of greatly expanded cattle feeding
operations.
Mexico now produces about 20m head of cattle each year and consumes between
18m and 19m, according to the institute.
'Under the Nafta, Mexico can eventually export to the US every single cow it
produces and simply import cheap beef from the rainforests regions of
Central and South America or highly subsidised beef from Europe to meet its
domestic food needs,' it said.
The US sugar industry will continue to be protected by a world-wide sugar
quota. Any increases in Mexican sugar exports to the US would come at the
expense of other producers, such as Caribbean countries. However, Mr Jack
Nelson, president of the Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers Association in
Texas, said in the long term the pact 'probably will end up destroying a
major part of the domestic sugar industry'.
Mexico has agreed to give the US an increased market share for its maize
exports, starting with 2.5m tonnes in the first year of the pact; all
Mexican protection for maize (as well as for beans, the other Mexican food
staple) will end in 15 years.
This puts in jeopardy Mexico's 2.74m small maize farmers, most of whom are
Indians and peasants eking out living on tiny mountain plots. They may leave
their land to seek work in either Mexican factories or in the US as
labourers.
It is unclear whether or not they will find work in the US, which has put at
risk its own fruit and vegetable sector - particularly in Florida. If it
cannot compete with Mexican fruit and vegetables, it may no longer need
Mexican workers.
There are winners and losers in all free trade pacts. The Private Sector
Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, appointed by the Bush
administration, said the gains were pretty well distributed between the
countries. A slightly larger percentage of Mexican products than US products
would benefit from the Nafta in the first ten years. However, since Mexico's
tariffs were generally much higher, the Mexican reduction would have 'a
greater trade liberalising effect'.

RESENTMENT over attacks by European environmentalists on Sarawak's timber
industry bubbled over in an address by the chief minister Datuk Patinggi Tan
Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud in Kuching this week to an audience of scientists
attending a workshop on Ecology, Conservation and Management of South East
Asian Rainforests.
He asked how much accusations tallied with facts and suggested that the
'green' lobby was political rather than scientific and, at the extreme,
could being seen as a form of protectionism restricting international trade
in tropical wood products.
His views are not surprising from a minister of the Malaysian state of
Sarawak, which is 70 per cent forest covered and depends very heavily on its
timber trade for revenue. And some of the frustration stems from a lack of
international recognition of the efforts being made to improve forest
management and control.
About 54 per cent of Sarawak's forest is classified as 'permanent forest
estate' (PFE) for timber production.
In 1990 an international team of forest and environment experts put together
by the International Tropical Timber Organisation was invited to review the
forest situation in Sarawak. One of its recommendations was a reduction in
annual log production from the PFE in order to be surer of future
sustainable harvests. As a result Sarawak set out to reduce production from
the PFE from 12.2m cubic metres to 9.2m cu m in two bites each of 1.5m cu m
in 1992 and 1993.
It has not been easy to contemplate a 25 per cent drop and the state
government has had to impose quotas on logging companies during the last
four months of this year to ensure the target is reached. Some timber
companies have had to reduce production by more than 50 per cent. Forest
areas outside the PFE are not subject to such controls.

<TEXT>
BOLIVIA HAS opened its doors to sugar imports in response to pressure from
soft drinks manufacturers hard hit by high domestic sugar prices.
Mr Fernando Campero, the exports minister, said in future the price of sugar
would be set solely by market forces. The Bolivian sugar industry, based
mostly in the eastern region of Santa Cruz, claims the decision will lead to
bankruptcies. However, bottling plants are said to be gearing up to take
advantage of cheaper sugar.
Mr Campero said the move was prompted by recent 'unjustified' price
increases by domestic producers. In the past month alone prices increased by
some 20 per cent to about Dollars 17.75 a cwt in Santa Cruz and Dollars
20.38 in La Paz.

subsidy war
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday aimed another shot across the European Community's bow with
the announcement of new offer to sell 870,000 tonnes of subsidised vegetable
oil worth Dollars 377m to 11 countries.
The subsidies, under the US Export Enhancement Program, were announced by Mr
Edward Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, one day after the US trade
representative returned from Europe without a settlement on the long-running
US-EC oilseeds dispute.
American farmers have been suffering from depressed soyabean prices because
of a large surplus by large surpluses and calls for further subsidised ales
have been made by Congressmen Jim Jontz and Tim Johnson, both democrats.
'We can think of nothing that will do more to positively affect farmer
income than boosting soyabean oil exports and thereby increasing the price
of soybean oil,' Mr Jontz said. 'Each 1 cent per lb increase in the price of
soyabean oil increases the value in the bushel of soyabeans by over 11
cents.'
In making the announcement Mr Madigan complained that the EC oilseeds
policy, found twice to have violated the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, 'provides production subsidies which guarantee EC oilseed producers
returns roughly twice the world market level.'
Mr Madigan claimed that the bundling of the subsidies would help avert sales
disruption and give farms and agribusiness 'greater certainty' on sales.
The following countries were targeted for sales: Algeria, China, the
Dominican Republic, the former Soviet Union, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Mexico,
Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Turkey.
Despite progress made on the agriculture talks in the Uruguay Round of the
Gatt, the US and EC remain far apart in their demands for settlement of the
oilseeds dispute, although an EC offer was reported to have been received.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, is due to meet at the weekend
with the trade ministers of Japan, Canada and the EC.
If agreement still appears elusive, she may then begin steps to impose
Dollars 1bn in US sanctions on EC food and beverage products. The EC has
threatened counter-retaliation.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US angers Caribbean banana
growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCREASING concern of Caribbean banana exporters, anxious over continued
preferential access to the European Community market after January, has
turned to anger directed at the US. Leaders of some of the region's banana
exporting countries have accused Washington of attempting to destroy their
economies by supporting arguments for an open market for bananas.
Caribbean officials say that in recent meetings in Washington to discuss the
likely impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement on the Caribbean
region, they were told by state department officials that the US was opposed
to a European Commission proposal for quotas to be applied to the banana
trade when a single EC market is created in January, and would support the
demands of Latin American exporters for an open market for the fruit.
'We were alarmed at the statements being made which affect our economy and
our social order,' said Mr James Mitchell, the prime minister of St Vincent,
one of the four Windward Islands whose economies depend on the European
banana market. The US position has sent the leaders of the banana producing
countries on a diplomatic offensive in Europe to argue in support of the
commission's proposals to place a quota on more competitively priced bananas
imported from Latin America, while safeguarding the access of fruit from
traditional sources.
Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, said that the efforts of
the prime ministers have been successful so far. 'The European Commission's
formula, which although not perfect, is one we can live with,' he said. 'But
the US government is absolutely opposed to this compromise and will fight to
ensure that it is not implemented and that there is free trade in bananas.'
He said if the US was successful, the banana industry in the Windward
Islands would be destroyed in within two years.
Mr Mitchell said that diplomatic forays into Europe were intended to tell
the EC countries that the banana producers did not intend to treat the US
position lightly. He explained: 'We cannot afford to give the impression
that we are taking these threats lightly'.
The prime minister said the US position on the banana market was rooted in a
botched attempt to capitalise on economic changes that had made eastern
Europe a large market for bananas and other fruit.
'In order to take advantage of these new markets, a number of American
companies began to expand production of bananas in Costa Rica and other
Central American countries,' the prime minister said. 'Because of a shortage
of foreign exchange, however, the East European countries could not buy
their bananas, so the American companies are stuck with them and are looking
for new markets in Western Europe and Britain'.
The prime minister said the companies had recruited the 'enormous power' of
the US government in an undertaking that would result in the 'destruction'
of the Windward Islands economies.

<TEXT>
Tudor, a tiles and crystal glassware company, recorded a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 117,000, after a Pounds 59,000 exceptional charge in the six months
to June 30. That followed the Pounds 71,000 deficit in the second half of
1991, when the final dividend was passed. The company was now said to be
profitable.
There is no interim dividend, against 0.5p paid from a profit of Pounds
94,000. Sales in the half year came to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 6.42m). Losses
per share were 1.06p (earnings 1.24p).

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Etam continues its recovery with Pounds
1.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETAM, the fashion retailer in which a South African concern has acquired a
34 per cent stake, built on last year's turnround in first-half profits to
make Pounds 1.2m pre-tax.
The improvement, from Pounds 35,000, followed a 7 per cent turnover increase
to Pounds 105.8m (Pounds 98.5m) in the 28 weeks to August 15. The interim
dividend is being raised 10 per cent to 1.65p.
Etam caters for women and girls from five upwards in its eponymous stores,
Snob and Tammy Girl. Less than 4 per cent of sales come from men's wear. The
group traded from 238 (239) stores and reduced its floorspace by nearly 1
per cent.
Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said sales had improved across the women's
wear ranges. Men's wear continued to lose money, and a boys' wear range had
been brought in to complement Tammy Girl. Its share of the women's wear
market had improved from 1.4 per cent in 1986 to 3 per cent.
Cost control had continued to be a priority.
While like-for-like sales were ahead since the half-way stage, consumer
confidence had 'totally disappeared in the three weeks since black
Wednesday,' Mr Miles said.
A cut in net interest payments to Pounds 25,000 (Pounds 412,000) was partly
offset by increased charges of Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 128,000) for
withdrawing from loss-making shops.
After capital spending of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 1.2m), borrowings stood at
Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 8.1m) and were expected to be eliminated by the
year-end.
After a high tax charge (is largely mitigated over the full year), earnings
per share stood at 0.52p (losses of 0.59p).
COMMENT
Etam, like Next, is well established on the recovery trail and this has been
fully reflected in the share price, which has soared above Oceana Investment
Corporation's 185p-a-share bid. The progress has been partly the product of
hard graft on costs and partly of the comparative resilience of the women's
wear market - so why bother with the Boyz 2 range? There is room to continue
marginal improvement - last year it was little more than 6 per cent at the
pre-interest level - but the task may become more difficult. Cost pressures
remain and a wage increase in the second half will make the staff line look
less flattering. Meanwhile sales at the 'Sharon' and 'Debbie' end of the
market might well be affected by rising unemployment, even if it is among
the menfolk. A full-year pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 14.5m gives a
prospective p/e of 17 to 18 on yesterday's close of 243p. This looks fully
priced. It remains worth holding for genuine recovery, and Oceana's interest
limits the downside.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fall in sales volume cuts UDO 37% to Pounds
5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UDO HOLDINGS, which supplies drawing office equipment and reprographic
services, saw year-end pre-tax profit fall 37 per cent in recessionary
trading conditions from Pounds 9.03m to Pounds 5.71m, writes Walton Morais.
Turnover fell from Pounds 55.84m to Pounds 51.71m in the year to July 31.
Despite measures taken to modify the operational structure, no amount of
savings in overheads could offset the profit lost by the volume fall.
The company made provisions of Pounds 300,000 for further rationalisation
and reorganisation costs, which pushed total exceptional charges to Pounds
517,000 (Pounds 213,000).
Although earnings per share fell to 13.66p (20.78p), the company is
recommending a final dividend of 4.76p for a 17 per cent increase in the
total payment to 6.70p. The company cited a strong balance sheet to justify
the increased payment. Cash balance at year-end stood at Pounds 13.3m,
making up 46 per cent of net assets. The dividend cover stood at 2 times,
down from about 3.5 times.

BNB RESOURCES, the recruit-ment, training and advertising group, suffered a
sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.26m to just Pounds 53,000 in the
first half of 1992.
The human resources side lifted its profits from Pounds 828,000 to Pounds
1.37m in the face of 'intense downward pressure' in UK recruitment markets,
said Mr David Norman, chairman. But property costs climbed to Pounds 827,000
(Pounds 341,000) because of a rent review in December 1991 and also because
the company had about 40 per cent of its building vacant for a time. This
space is now refurbished and used by ATC.
ATC, the chartered accountancy training company acquired at the end of 1991
for a total Pounds 5.25m, was the other main cause of the downturn.
Mr Norman said that although modest profits had been expected in ATC's first
year, revenues had declined by about 15 per cent. He expected the training
division would break even over the full year.
The group had cash balances of Pounds 3m.
Earnings fell to 0.1p (3.9p) per share and the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.6p.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Tanks and luxury cars put Vickers in
reverse - How a famous name has been left vulnerable to takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR COLIN Chandler, the ebullient chief executive of Vickers, the
engineering group, is caught between a rock and a hard place.
Making tanks is not easy in a post-Cold War world, with government defence
budgets under pressure. It is even harder to be manufacturing Rolls-Royce
and Bentley limousines in the depths of an international recession that has
seen fashion swing sharply against the conspicuous spending excesses of the
previous decade.
Unfortunately these businesses are the main pillars of Vickers, a famous
name in British engineering. The downturn in both areas has reduced its
market value from last year's peak of Pounds 637m to its current level of
Pounds 216m, making it vulnerable to predators.
Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars have fallen by 65 per cent over the
past 18 months. Last month Rolls-Royce Motor Cars said it would cut a
further 950 jobs, or nearly a third of the workforce, from its plant at
Crewe in Cheshire, leaving the UK workforce at 2,100. At the end of 1990 the
figure stood at 4,850.
Uncertain market conditions contributed to the failure of intensive efforts
this year to find a strategic partner for Rolls-Royce, despite serious
discussions with rivals such as BMW of Germany.
Sir Colin intends to trade Rolls-Royce from a new breakeven position of
1,400 cars a year, down from 2,800 in 1990. He also believes that
negotiations on some sort of partnership will resume when markets improve.
Meanwhile, however, the restructuring at Rolls-Royce has savaged Vickers'
results and share price.
In the six months to June 30, the group made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.3m,
having lost Pounds 12.4m in 1991 as a whole. The latest redundancies at
Crewe will be taken as a Pounds 12m exceptional charge in the second half of
the year.
The tanks business is profitable, but the outlook is uncertain. Last year
the group won a British government contract worth Pounds 500m to produce 140
of its new Challenger 2 battle tanks, work which should last until 1998.
However, this week Vickers accused the Americans of using political leverage
in Kuwait to clinch a tank deal for General Dynamics, involving the sale of
236 M1A2 Abrams tanks.
Vickers still hopes to sell hundreds of tanks to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates. However the current dominant role of the US in the area
following the Gulf war makes that outcome extremely uncertain. Vickers' best
chance of winning an order seems to be in Oman, which wants only about 60
tanks.
The group had also been hoping to upgrade the turrets and guns of the
British army's existing Challenger 1 tanks, but that contract seems
vulnerable in the current search for public spending cuts.
Winning a substantial tanks order would come as a welcome relief, since the
normally substantial advanced payments would help offset the cash drain
caused by Rolls-Royce Motors. Debt has been rising rapidly and is likely to
reach Pounds 110m by the year-end, lifting gearing to nearly 50 per cent.
The cash shortage and business climate has forced the group to postpone
indefinitely the costly development of a generation of new luxury cars.
Instead Sir Colin said that Rolls-Royce would be seeking to evolve its
existing models.
So what can Sir Colin do, apart from hang on and wait for recovery?
That may be the best strategy, assuming that the latest job cuts at Crewe
will staunch the luxury car losses. Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley
vehicles bounced back rapidly after the last recession, and the famous
marques are arguably still under-exploited.
But will Vickers be allowed to follow its own path. The group's combination
of famous names and low share price appear to make it vulnerable to a
predator, prepared to take a long-term view and use acquisition accounting
to cover the costs of further rationalisation.
Sceptics counter that the tank business is highly specialised, in an
industry with chronic overcapacity. And any prospective buyer of Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars would have to negotiate with Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine maker,
an entirely separate company, which owns the Rolls-Royce brand name.
Vickers does have clutch of quality niche businesses. It dominates the UK
and the US markets for neo-natal equipment such as incubators, while
Cosworth engines power many of the world's racing cars, as well as some
high-performance Ford cars. Ross Catherall makes super alloys for the
aerospace industry and KaMeWa is the world leader in water jet propulsion
technology.
Vickers could strengthen its balance sheet by selling some of these
businesses, although it has given no indication of intending to do so.
However, it would be unlikely to obtain top prices in present market
conditions, and any such disposal would counter the group's stated policy of
lessening its exposure to defence.
That Vickers is aware of the dangers of a bid was apparent in the careful
balance of its interim results statement last month. A cut in the dividend
was justified thus: 'Prospects for the year are uncertain and it is
therefore prudent to conserve cash and ensure our ability to support our
defence, aerospace, marine engineering, medical businesses, and Cosworth,
all of which are trading satisfactorily.'
Last autumn Hawker Siddeley, the diversified engineering group, came out
with a very gloomy results statement and BTR, the industrial conglomerate,
pounced with a successful takeover offer worth Pounds 1.55bn.
As a former rugby player, Sir Colin might be tempted to just keep his head
down and battle on until recovery comes.
However, there must also be strong chance that the chief executive will feel
obliged to come up with something, such as a disposal, to make it less
likely that other people's tanks appear on his lawn.

Jones Group, the Irish conglomerate, has decided to hold its interim
dividend at 4p, given a decision to pull out of Enviroquip in the US and the
satisfactory earnings performance in other divisions.
In the first half of 1992 turnover rose from IPounds 45.6m to IPounds 50.6m
but pre-tax profit slumped from IPounds 2.56m to IPounds 1.21m, or Pounds
1.29m.
Enviroquip, the group's remaining environmental company, is being sold to
local management. The consideration is a nominal Dollars 200,000; but a
package has been agreed under which the group will retain a minority
interest, carrying 19 per cent of the voting rights.
In the group accounts there is an extraordinary charge of IPounds 6.5m
representing IPounds 4.5m to cover the package and the write off of the
investment, plus IPounds 2m for goodwill.
Earnings per share for the half year came to 6.9p (17.1p).

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: European Leisure falls Pounds 45.6m into
the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN LEISURE, the troubled disco and snooker hall operator which is
struggling to reorganise despite a mountain of debt, yesterday reported a
Pounds 45.6m full-year pre-tax loss after exceptional items.
The exceptional charges in the year to June 30 totalled Pounds 47.5m (Pounds
880,000) including Pounds 36.9m in provisions for losses expected on
disposals and Pounds 10.6m in goodwill transfers from reserves, and were
Pounds 610,000 higher than the charges announced at the time of the interim
results.
The full year pre-tax loss compares with a Pounds 5.23m profit and came on
turnover down 11.3 per cent to Pounds 75.1m (Pounds 84.8m) reflecting the
impact of the recession in the UK and continental Europe.
While reduced consumer spending has affected the leisure market as a whole,
high unemployment among young people has particularly hit European Leisure's
customer base.
This, coupled with intense competition, affected profitability, although the
group's snooker operations proved more resilient and its Maygay Machines
business, which designs and manufactures fruit machines, reported a
substantial increase in turnover and operating profits.
Overall trading profits fell by almost 27 per cent to Pounds 9.58m (Pounds
13.1m), but were helped by Pounds 2m of overhead savings and tighter
management controls. Net interest payments rose to Pounds 7.7m (Pounds
6.96m).
Losses per share were 29.04p (earnings of 2.52p).
As already announced there was a Pounds 8.81m (Pounds 7.35m) extraordinary
charge relating to the disposal of the group's two floating nightclubs on
the Tyne.
Mr Ian Rock, chief executive, said the group's substantial disposal
programme, which involves selling 30 out of 111 units including all of its
loss-making businesses in France and Spain, was making progress.
With shareholders' funds reduced to Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 76.2m) the group's
gearing has increased from 94 per cent to 227 per cent.
The group remains under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office concerning
its acquisition of Midsummer Leisure in 1990.
COMMENT
European Leisure ran into trouble soon after its acrimonious takeover of
Midsummer Leisure. Since then the new management team has written down
assets to more realistic levels and identified a fifth of its retail estate,
including the loss-making continental businesses, for disposal. However, the
recession has hit the group's core young customer group hard. This means
that trading profits only just cover the costs of servicing the group's
debt. Although the full-year result held no new nasty surprises, the
management faces a long uphill struggle to sell businesses and reduce debt -
a difficult task in the current climate. Until the balance sheet is
considerably strengthened there will be no shareholder dividends. In the
meantime the share price is bumping along the bottom at 3p. For those
unlucky enough to own the stock, it is probably not worth selling.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pentland criticised as talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENTLAND'S DECISION to call off negotiations with Bernard Tapie Finance
(BTF) over the purchase of Adidas, the sports shoe company, led to a
characteristically fiery attack from Mr Tapie, and a characteristically
reserved response from Pentland.
Mr Tapie accused Pentland of trying to renegotiate the price of the
purchase, agreed in July, while Pentland said it had found problems which
BTF had been unable to resolve. Because of a confidentiality agreement,
Pentland and its advisers refused to comment on what problems they had
unearthed.
But behind the recriminations must lie a profound sense of disappointment on
all sides that a deal with remarkable internal logic and cohesion appears to
be off.
Pentland, with net cash of more than Pounds 250m from the sale of a stake in
Reebok, US sports shoe maker, wanted another international brand to nurture.
Adidas had the brand but needed new investment to revive it. Mr Tapie needed
the money to restore his business empire, which has been in decline since he
bought Adidas in a highly leveraged deal in 1990.
Mr Frank Farrant, Pentland finance director, said the company's outstanding
20 per cent stake in Adidas, acquired last year, would be retained even
though a new agreement with Mr Tapie was unlikely, especially given the
ferocity of his attacks on Pentland yesterday. 'From our point of view the
deal is now dead,' Mr Farrant said.
This leaves Adidas with the same problems which have constrained its growth
since Mr Tapie's takeover, a lack of cash.
BTF said yesterday it would invest 'between FFr500m and FFr600m (Pounds 60m
to Pounds 70m)' in Adidas and discuss with other minority shareholders, a
group dominated by Credit Lyonnais and Banque Worms, the French banks, and
the Assurances Generales de France insurance group.
Mr Tapie said they needed 'to discuss ways of saving Adidas as quickly as
possible'. It has had serious financial problems and is on course for
another year of losses.
However it is not clear whether BTF would be able to finance its share of
such a capital injection. Mr Tapie has in the past made unfulfilled promises
to provide capital for Adidas. Even if the investment is made, it will not
be enough to solve Adidas' problems.
It has been slow to take advantage of cheaper production in the Far East,
and its margins are about 1.5 per cent compared nearly 15 for rivals Nike
and Reebok. It has an inadequate share, about 2 per cent, of the world's
largest sports shoe market in the US, and its brand name needs reviving in
other major markets.
'It is potentially a great brand,' an industry observer said. 'But the
costs, financial and political, of closing factories in Europe will be very
high. And the days of premium branding and ridiculous prices for sports
shoes seem to be over,' he said.
Adidas' future is further complicated because at least some clauses of an
exclusivity agreement between BTF and Pentland remain in place. This would
appear to guarantee Pentland some first refusal over any sales of Adidas
shares, and could frustrate attempts by Mr Tapie to sell the company to a
third party.
Pentland's future is equally uncertain, although the company's cash pile
allows it time to consider its options. It has a collection of smaller brand
names, like swimwear group Speedo, which it is developing.
But the company's ambitions to manage a major brand have been frustrated
again. Analysts confessed to a sense of deja vu. Pentland tried in 1988 to
take over Parker, the pen maker, but pulled out when certain environmental
indemnities were not forthcoming.
According to BTF's advisers, the conservatism and caution of Mr Stephen
Rubin, Pentland chairman, helped scupper the deal because he kept insisting
on more and more guarantees. Pentland's advisers claimed that Pentland had
to be cautious because of the nature and complexity of Mr Tapie's group.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson shows heavier loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWEN &amp; ROBINSON, the jewellery and sports footwear retailer which brought in
new management in April, yesterday announced doubled pre-tax losses of
Pounds 2.44m for the half-year to July 31.
Both the preferred and the ordinary dividend (0.15p) are being passed.
The deepening losses from last time's Pounds 1.23m were struck on turnover
up 29 per cent at Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 7.9m). The 16 per cent sales rise in
Gold Centre, which increased the number of its shops by 22 to 59 during
1991, was entirely accounted for by those new shops, the company said.
Like-for-like sales, however, were down.
Foothold, which lifted the number of its sports footwear shops by 5 to 13 in
1991, lifted sales 66 per cent, though on a like-for-like basis sales only
rose 10 per cent.
The new management team started the group rationalisaimmediately - some 110
posts, or 25 per cent of the workforce, had been lost. The savings from this
and the other cost reduction schemes would come through in the second half,
Mr Smith said.
Operating losses were Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 450,000) and, though interest
payable was down at Pounds 405,000 (Pounds 778,000) on borrowings of Pounds
6.1m, there were exceptional costs of Pounds 300,000 relating to the
departure of senior management. Mr Smith said gearing was 'awful'. Losses
per share emerged at 5.7p (7.8p) reflecting the full effect of the 1991
rights issue.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: National Express in the fast lane - The
coach company's route to the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS BEEN a long time coming, but after years of deregulation and
privatisation, Britain's public transport sector is about to see its first
operator make a debut on the London stock market.
In the next few weeks National Express, the country's biggest express coach
service operator, plans to seek a listing through a placing and offer for
sale likely to value it at more than Pounds 50m.
The flotation is a logical consequence of the privatisation policies pursued
so vigorously in the transport sector since the Conservatives took office in
1979.
Airlines, airports, ferries, ports, roadfreight and buses have all gradually
been divested by the state. Some, such as British Airways, BAA, Associated
British Ports and NFC, have also found their way to the stock market. But
National Express is the first bus or coach operator to seek a listing.
The reason is that bus privatisation is still a relatively recent
phenomenon. Although the break-up of the state-owned National Bus Company
began in 1986, it took two years to complete and, amid the turmoil that has
accompanied the deregulation of the bus market, few companies are
sufficiently well-established to consider a flotation.
National Express is slightly different. Express coach services were
deregulated in 1980 and the big battles for market share were fought while
the company was state-owned. When National Express was bought by its
management in 1988, it was well-established as the dominant player.
Today, National Express white coaches with double arrowhead insignia are
familiar on Britain's trunk roads and motorways. The company has 180 routes
linking 1,000 towns and cities and about 80 per cent of the express coach
service market.
It is less well-known that National Express owns few vehicles. It contracts
about 55 coach operators to run its routes at fixed rates, using their
vehicles painted in the National Express livery. The company makes its money
from the difference between the fares it collects and the amount it pays its
contractors.
At first glance, this has not proved particularly successful. The prospectus
for the flotation is expected to show pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.24m on
turnover of Pounds 113.8m in the year to December 1991, compared with losses
of Pounds 2.91m on turnover of Pounds 125.8m the year before.
However, National Express has changed since these losses were incurred. In
July last year, the company was acquired by a management team headed by Mr
Ray McEnhill and Mr Adam Mills and backed by a consortium of venture capital
investors. Mr McEnhill and Mr Mills have considerable experience in
passenger transport. In 1986 they formed Drawlane, one of Britain's biggest
private sector bus companies. Drawlane companies count among the biggest
suppliers of National Express services, so Mr McEnhill and Mr Mills are
severing connections with their previous company to avoid conflicts of
interest.
According to the new management, National Express's losses in 1990 arose
from misguided acquisitions, and the losses in 1991 were caused by
write-offs incurred in disposing of them. On continuing operations, Mr Mills
says, National Express would have made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.8m last
year, and the company is likely to come to the market on a profits forecast
topping that figure.
The proportion of shares to be sold has yet to be fixed but 75 per cent of
the tranche will be placed and the other 25 per cent sold in an open offer.
Advisers are Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, and Smith New Court, the
stockbrokers.
Experience of previous privatisations is likely to stimulate interest, with
investors wondering whether they are looking at another transport success
story such as British Airways or NFC. On the other hand, National Express
operates in a mature market. An increasing proportion of long-distance
journeys are by car with rail accounting for much of the rest. Coach travel
accounts for only one or two per cent, mostly those at the budget end of the
market by students and the elderly.
Other adverse influences include downward pressure on fares as British
Rail's InterCity sector seeks to fill empty seats with special offers; EC
legislation reducing coach speeds (and, perhaps more significantly, the
speed of the lorries on the road in front of them) and rising traffic
congestion, bringing the threat of greater delays and/or road tolls.
Still, National Express is optimistic. It is planning to counter the
down-market image of coach travel and stress its modern-day comforts, such
as air-conditioning, videos and hostess service; it sees good growth in its
Speedlink airport services, expanding on the back of rising air travel and
it says it has several tricks up its sleeve which are too confidential to
talk about.
Pressed on the last, it hints that rail privatisation is opening up
opportunities for companies that see themselves as surface transport
companies instead of just bus or coach operators. Mr McEnhill says: 'It
would be amazing if we weren't paying very close attention to it.'

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gateway suppliers complain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME SUPPLIERS to the Gateway grocery chain yesterday claimed they had not
been paid for deliveries in recent days although the company attributed the
problem to a temporary 'glitch' caused by the installation of a new computer
and stressed it had surplus cash in the bank.
It is not uncommon for some retailers deliberately to delay payments -
especially when they wish to conserve cash in the business near the end of a
reporting period.
Isosceles' cashflow has also been stretched recently as a result of the
delay in disposing of Wellworth, its Northern Irish grocery chain.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 19m price tag on Linx Printing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINX PRINTING Technologies, one of a clutch of UK companies which dominate
the continuous inkjet printing business, is coming to the market through a
placing valuing it at Pounds 18.8m.
Some 3.62m shares are being placed with institutions at 130p. Of the total,
about 1.54m are new shares, and the rest existing shares being sold by
directors, their family trusts and Paribas, an institutional shareholder
involved in the initial funding of the company.
The company's advisers yesterday poured cold water on the idea that a higher
striking price had been anticipated, arguing that Linx p/e ratio should be
at a slight premium to that of Domino, the UK and European market leader.
Domino was trading at a p/e of 15.2 yesterday; at 130p, Linx' historic p/e
is 15.5. Dealings should start on October 22.
The company will receive Pounds 1.3m after expenses. Linx said it sought a
listing principally to gain access to financial markets. It was anxious to
acquire complementary businesses and it believed a number of possibilities
may become available.
The company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.65m in the year ended June 30
1992, a 79 per cent increase, on sales up 62 per cent at Pounds 10.47m.
Continuous inkjet printing produces images of lower quality than office
inkjet ('drop-on-demand') printing, but at speeds compatible with modern
production lines.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Abbeycrest Pounds 739,000 in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEMS of the UK retail jewellery trade hit Abbeycrest, the UK's
leading jewellery maker, which reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 739,000 in
the first half of the year compared with a Pounds 32,000 profit. The interim
dividend was maintained at 1.2p. The shares shares fell 5p to 33p.
However, Mr Michael Lever, chairman, said that the group was now trading
profitably. He said retailers were cautious about the all-important
Christmas period with orders later than usual. 'It will be a wait-and-see
Christmas,' he said.
Abbeycrest, which refuses to comment on its customers' business, is a
leading supplier to Ratners, the troubled jewellery retailer. In 1989 nearly
60 per cent of Abbeycrest's turnover went to Ratners, but the group has
built up its sales to other customers.
'Abbeycrest's largest customer will account for only around 15 per cent of
this year's turnover', Mr Lever said. He would not confirm if this was
Ratners.
Abbeycrest has also arranged credit insurance to protect all its turnover
against customer default.
In the first half sales fell 9.9 per cent to Pounds 14.5m and there was an
operating loss of Pounds 630,000 (profit Pounds 341,000). Net interest costs
fell from Pounds 309,000 to Pounds 109,000. Mr Lever said gearing had fallen
to less than 40 per cent at the half year end, down from twice that a year
earlier.
A loss per share of 2.1p (earnings of 0.1p) was recorded.

FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Construction downturn leaves MJ Gleeson
lower
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MJ GLEESON, the Surrey-based construction, housebuilding and property group,
reported a 16 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.8m to
Pounds 9.94m for the year to June 30.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 183m (Pounds 199m).
The company, however, is proposing to increase the final dividend by 7.55
per cent to 9.4p for a total of 12.75p (11.58p). Earnings per share were
67.1p (75.49p).
Trading profits from construction and housebuilding fell to Pounds 3.94m
(Pounds 5.83m) but were partly offset by an increase in rents from
commercial property which grew to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 3.56m). Net interest
received fell from Pounds 2.46m to Pounds 1.39m.
Because of the depressed state of the commercial and industrial property
market, the company has departed from its previous policy of revaluing one
third of its investment properties each year.
At June 30 the group's investment and owner-occupied properties were valued
at Pounds 55.1m resulting in a deficit of Pounds 7.21m. The company noted
that while the reduction in the value of properties was 'disappointing' it
represented a diminution of only 11.78 per cent on previously reported
figures.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Alastair Morton faces financial engineering test: Why
Eurotunnel's negotiations with banks will be difficult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING the Channel tunnel has to date been as much a feat of financial
engineering as of civil engineering.
But Sir Alastair Morton, the former merchant banker who is co-chairman of
Eurotunnel, now faces his biggest test. He has to persuade Eurotunnel's 220
bank creditors to continue giving the company access to its Pounds 6.8bn of
banking facilities.
Bankers are uneasy about providing this support as the Pounds 6.8bn is
inadequate to meet the company's needs over the next three years, but Sir
Alastair is refusing to give any binding commitments on how this funding
shortfall will be met.
The company's 18 leading or 'instructing' banks met on Wednesday with the
four agent, or main banks - National Westminster and Midland of the UK and
France's Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais - to discuss the
conditions they should impose on Eurotunnel in return for continued access
to the funds.
A banker described the meeting as 'lively', with two UK clearers, Barclays
and Lloyds, wanting to provide a longer-term funding commitment to
Eurotunnel than Midland and NatWest.
Eurotunnel and the banks concur however that sometime in 1994 the company
will have drawn down all its loans - having already used up all its equity -
and need about Pounds 500m more.
'We will have used up the Pounds 6.8bn by the autumn of 1994 on our
forecasts,' Sir Alastair said yesterday.
The banks, on the other hand, believe that Eurotunnel will need to ask for
new funds in spring 1994.
There are two main reasons for the funding shortfall:
The tunnel is opening later than expected, in spring 1994 at the latest. The
company's official line is that opening could be 'either side of Christmas
1993', unless there is a settlement of its long-running dispute over
construction costs with Transmanche Link, the group of contractors building
the tunnel, in which case it must open in mid-December under the contract.
There will be significant delays in the delivery of rolling stock, so
revenues will build up only gradually in 1994, while the company will have
to pay out huge amounts in bank interest. Data shown to the banks on
Wednesday illustrates that borrowings continue to rise to the end of the
decade, mainly due to interest charges.
As a result, Eurotunnel will need to be recapitalised with an injection of
new equity. However, Eurotunnel believes it is impractical to ask
shareholders for that money now.
It could not issue a formal prospectus to accompany a share issue at the
moment, because there are too many uncertainties about its future costs and
revenues. Sir Alastair wants to wait until the company has operated for a
full year - and can assess profitability - before raising around Pounds 500m
from a rights issue and possibly also the sale of convertible bonds.
But if the company will need to raise new equity, then some banks argue that
they are already 'taking an equity risk' by continuing to provide debt
finance. So they say they should earn an equity return.
The four agent banks have therefore told Eurotunnel that it should pay the
banks tens of millions of pounds in additional fees - Pounds 50m according
to one banker - in return for their continued support.
Eurotunnel was outraged by this suggestion, having been forced by its banks
to quibble over much smaller demands for payment from TML.
But Eurotunnel's more fundamental criticism of the banks' demand is that
they are only proposing to allow Eurotunnel to continue to draw funds for a
further six months - or possibly another year - after which there would be
another round of bank negotiations.
Using the bankers' jargon, the agent banks are proposing to waive breaches
of the lending covenants to allow Eurotunnel access to the loan facilities.
There is a deadline of the end of November to secure the waiver - assent is
required from 65 per cent of the banks.
However Sir Alastair wants the waiver to last until the tunnel is open. If
the banks were to concur, Eurotunnel would probably concede the payment of
additional fees, though it would still balk at Pounds 50m.
Eurotunnel needs the waiver because it is in breach of its loan covenants.
Indeed there is even a dispute between Eurotunnel and its banks about
whether the breach is a less serious, 'technical' breach, or whether the
company is in default, as the banks claim.
This latter disagreement hinges on expectations of Eurotunnel's revenues
during the early years of operation.
The banks' forecast of traffic through the tunnel in 1994 is more
pessimistic than Eurotunnel's. As a result, the banks expect the company's
peak indebtedness to be Pounds 100m higher than Eurotunnel does.
Even if Sir Alastair succeeds in obtaining a waiver until the tunnel is
open, this would probably merely defer a final showdown with the banks. In
the spring of 1994 the banks would have to provide additional debt as a
bridging loan, pending a rights issue.
Eurotunnel was taken to the brink of financial collapse the last time it
tried to obtain additional bank facilities from its banks, in the autumn of
1990. The company would not expect it to be easier this time.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Lloyds Chemists sees pre-tax profit increase 78% to Pounds
36.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Chemists, the acquisitive UK retailer which took over its rival
Macarthy in March, increased pre-tax profit by 78 per cent, from Pounds
20.8m to Pounds 36.9m, in the year to June.
Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 509.4m, from Pounds 247.5m, as the
group added in Macarthy for three months, a maiden Pounds 53m from its
wholesale operation, and the expansion of its health food and drug store
chains.
The share price shed 10p yesterday to close at 202p.
Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive, said acquisitions had added
more than Pounds 3m to profit. The figures also benefited from a full year
from the 1990-91 acquisitions, notably Kingswood chemists' and Holland &amp;
Barrett health food stores.
Like-for-like growth was 9 per cent in the chemists' shops; 4 per cent in
the drug stores; and zero in health food, turned round during the year.
Operating profit advanced by 66 per cent to Pounds 40.1m as the group
absorbed the lower-margin Macarthy businesses, including the Savory &amp; Moore
chemists' chain, and expanded its Barclay Enterprise wholesale wing.
The full-year impact of the Kingswood-linked rights issue and the shares for
more recent purchases held the advance in fully diluted earnings per share
to 20 per cent: from 20.96p to 25.05p. The total dividend rises by 33 per
cent to 5.55p after a 4p final.
Mr Lloyd said the figures included a Pounds 2m provision for the NHS-imposed
cut in generic drug prices. In the current year, this would cost Pounds
6m-Pounds 8m.
The sales breakdown showed the chemist division, with the highest margins,
increasing from Pounds 190m to Pounds 314m. Drug stores contributed Pounds
62.9m, up from Pounds 51m, and Holland &amp; Barrett, up to Pounds 46.8m from
Pounds 6.5m. Operating profit from these three rose from Pounds 26.1m to
Pounds 39.2m.
Wholesale and manufacturing, a new division, made Pounds 3.4m profit on
Pounds 83.1m turnover. Property again contributed Pounds 1.1m.
Interest costs were little changed at Pounds 3.3m and net debt rose to
Pounds 20.9m, compared with Pounds 5.5m cash, debt-equity gearing of 22 per
cent.
Mr Dick Steele, finance director, said more than Pounds 40m had been spent
on acquisitions, mostly on debt taken on in the process.

FT  16 OCT 92 / IBM falls to loss of Dollars 2.8bn in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines surprised Wall Street yesterday with
earnings far weaker than expected.
IBM reported third-quarter net earnings, before charges, of only Dollars 86m
(Pounds 50m), or 15 cents per share, far less than the most pessimistic
projections.
After previously announced restructuring charges of Dollars 4.43bn, IBM's
net losses for the quarter were Dollars 2.8bn or Dollars 4.87 per share
compared with third quarter 1991 net earnings of Dollars 177m or 31 cents.
Revenues rose from Dollars 14.4bn to Dollars 14.7bn.
IBM shares, trading recently at a 10-year low, fell to Dollars 72 7/8 at the
close in New York, down from Wednesday's closing price of Dollars 78.
IBM's disappointing performance served in part to drag the broader market
down. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 20.80 points lower
at 3,174.68.
IBM said dividend payments would not be affected. Mr Frank Metz, IBM senior
vice president, said: 'We have no need or plans to do anything about the
dividend.'
IBM blamed the European currency crisis, with slow sales of mainframe and
personal computers, for its poor third-quarter performance.
The charges announced last month covered the cost of reducing IBM's
workforce and consolidating manufacturing capacity. The company said then it
expected 40,000 employees to accept voluntary severance; twice the number it
had originally projected.
The charges were partially offset by a tax benefit.
Mr John Akers, chairman, said: 'Our business was adversely affected by
economic turmoil in Europe, particularly at the close of the quarter, and by
persistent economic weakness in the US and Japan. Our hardware profits
continued to be hurt by price pressures, especially within our personal
computer line.'
Mr Metz said IBM had not expected the effect of the currency turmoil in
Europe.
Revenues for the first nine months were Dollars 45bn, up 5.1 per cent from
Dollars 42.8bn in 1991. Net earnings, after charges and tax benefits, were
Dollars 498m or 87 cents, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.4bn or Dollars
2.46 per share in the same period last year.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Trafalgar forced to amend accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House, the engineering, property and construction group, has bowed
to pressure from the Financial Reporting Review Panel to amend its 1991
accounts. The FRRP had threatened to seek a court order requiring Trafalgar
to prepare revised accounts for the financial year ending September 30 last
year.
The amendments will cut Trafalgar's 1991 pre-tax profits by Pounds 102.7m to
Pounds 19.7m and reduce shareholders' funds by Pounds 20m. Trafalgar will
restate the 1991 figures when the 1992 accounts are published.
The FRRP was set up last year to monitor standards of financial reporting.
The Trafalgar case is the largest issue it has yet considered and the first
time it has come close to going to court. The panel said the case showed
companies that it 'would and will go to court if necessary'.
Trafalgar is under siege from Hongkong Land, which last week failed to build
on its 14.9 per cent stake in Trafalgar through a tender offer. Trafalgar
said in its defence document against the tender, published earlier this
month, that it was in talks with the FRRP but that amendments to its
accounting practices and policies should not affect the aggregate of
shareholders' funds at September 30, 1991.
The group had reclassified some properties as fixed assets rather than
current assets. As a result a Pounds 102.7m deficit on revaluation of
properties had originally been charged direct to reserves. This deficit will
now be charged against 1991 profits, cutting the pre-tax profit from Pounds
122.4m.
The company will also change its policy on advance corporation tax, adding
Pounds 20m to the 1991 tax charge originally stated at Pounds 40.4m, and
reducing shareholders funds' at September 30, 1991 by Pounds 20m to Pounds
684.6m. The change in policy on ACT will also affect the 1992 tax charge,
increasing the write-off.
Trafalgar's 1991 accounts received an unqualified report from its auditors
Touche Ross.
The Ritz, Trafalgar's luxury London hotel, yesterday lost an appeal to the
House of Lords to overturn a High Court ruling that the hotel was to blame
when Mr Anthony Ward fell over the balustrade on the hotel's terrace. Mr
Ward is suing the hotel for up to Pounds 3m, which if successful will be the
largest personal damages award ever given in the UK.

FT  16 OCT 92 / US dashes hopes of compromise on world trade talks

THE US has 'stretched as far as possible' in its negotiations with the
European Community aimed at achieving a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of
talks on world trade liberalisation, President George Bush said yesterday in
a letter to EC leaders.
In a second shot across Europe's bows in one day, the US also announced
plans to sell 870,000 tonnes of subsidised vegetable oil worth Dollars 377m
(Pounds 219m) to 11 countries. On Wednesday the US trade representative
returned from Europe without a settlement on a long-running US-EC oilseeds
dispute.
This apparent hardening of the US negotiating position coincides with a
similar hardening in the EC, as Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, said Europe should stand up to the US in negotiations on
subsidised farm trade.
His comments will hearten French officials, who have risked creating a deep
division inside the EC by insisting they will not sacrifice French farm
interests to get Mr Bush re-elected. They accuse EC negotiators of caving in
to US pressure.
EC officials nevertheless showed concern that France was opposed not only to
a farm settlement with the US, but that they did not believe the Common
Agricultural Policy reform would work or be adhered to. 'It is clear now
that France never really intended to comply with CAP reform,' one senior
Commission official said yesterday.
EC and US officials believe an agreement on the Uruguay Round must be
reached before the US presidential election on November 3, in part because
Mr Bush wants to lift his waning electoral fortunes.
Talks aimed at reaching a breakthrough fell short of a conclusion in
Brussels this week. But negotiators said they had 'narrowed the gap', and
will continue talks over this week.
Mr Bush said in the letter sent ahead of today's special EC summit in
Birmingham, where the stalled Uruguay Round will be on the agenda: 'The
negotiators have done all they can. Now we need the political will.'
On the eve of the EC summit, the British government spokesman said 'good
progress' had been made in the recent EC-US negotiations. He described
President Bush's letter as 'optimistic and encouraging' rather than
signifying the imposition of a new deadline. It was aimed at giving an
impetus to an early and successful conclusion of the Uruguay round of tariff
negotiations.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Bush battles to close poll gap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush, struggling to regain ground in the last 19 days of
the US presidential campaign, last night strongly defended his trade policy
and decried those who favour protectionism.
'Free and fair trade is the answer, not protectionism. We've had tough
economic times and it's exports that have saved us,' Mr Bush said in the
second of three televised debates with Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic
challenger, and Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate.
Answering the same question, Mr Clinton said he favoured more trade but on
fair terms. 'The trick is to expand our export base and expand our trade on
terms that are fair to us,' he added.
Perched uncomfortably on high stools, the three candidates fielded questions
from an audience of 209 uncommitted voters in Richmond, Virginia.
Although Mr Bush briefly embarked on an attack on Mr Clinton's character and
student opposition to the Vietnam war, the audience quickly made clear it
was unhappy with the mudslinging in the campaign for the November 3
election.
Mr Perot attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) recently
negotiated by President Bush with Mexico and Canada, warning that it would
open the way for many businesses to transfer jobs to Mexico.
'There will be a giant sucking sound going south,' he said.
But Mr Bush said that exports had saved the US during the current global
economic slowdown, and said Nafta would not mean job losses to Mexico.
The debate came as latest opinion polls showed Mr Clinton still well ahead
of Mr Bush and Mr Perot. A CNN/USA Today poll gave Mr Clinton a 15-point
lead over the president, based on voter surveys conducted in the three days
after Sunday's first presidential debate. It showed Mr Clinton with 47 per
cent support to 32 per cent for Mr Bush and 15 per cent for Mr Perot.
But another poll, by ABC News, showed that Mr Bush might at last be starting
to cut into Mr Clinton's lead, because it showed the Democratic challenger
just seven points ahead. The poll, conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, gave
Mr Clinton 44 per cent of the vote to 37 per cent for Mr Bush and 11 per
cent for Mr Perot.

FT  16 OCT 92 / BR fares to rise by up to 9.5%: Increases in rail and London
Transport prices prompt protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL and London Transport prompted angry protests yesterday by
announcing government-approved fare rises averaging 7.5 per cent and 8.5 per
cent respectively, more than double the rate of inflation.
The increases come as private sector businesses are moderating or foregoing
price rises in the face of a severe recession. But BR and LT are able to
impose big increases because many of their passengers, particularly
rush-hour commuters in London and the south-east, cannot realistically turn
to alternative means of transport.
Network SouthEast commuters will pay up to 9.5 per cent more for season
tickets, while holders of LT Travelcard season tickets will pay up to 10 per
cent more.
Other rail travellers will face lower-than-average increases because BR is
trying to stem the downturn in leisure travel by keeping off-peak fares
competitive.
The Central Transport Consultative Committee, the statutory rail passengers'
watchdog, accused BR of exploiting its monopoly position.
Major-General Lennox Napier, the committee's chairman, said: 'Fare increases
above the rate of inflation are only justifiable where there have been
material improvements in services and where quality standards are being
fully met.
'Both InterCity and Network SouthEast failed to meet some of their key
quality targets in 1991-92, so the decision to raise season ticket rates by
an average of twice the rate of inflation is unreasonable.'
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said: 'Britain's railways are
now the most expensive and least invested, with reducing quality, of any
developed European railway system.'
British Rail said higher fares were needed to offset a downturn in revenues.
It was also facing higher safety and security costs and needed to fund a
substantial investment programme.
It said the highest fare increases were being paid by commuters who had
benefited from new trains.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said: 'Both BR and London
Underground are in the middle of enormous investment programmes. Much of
that money comes from the taxpayer, but it is only right that passengers
should make a contribution.'
