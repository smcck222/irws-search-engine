FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (7): Peace dividend brings problems -
Richard Evans investigates Plymouth's efforts to revitalise itself
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PLYMOUTH, a big industrial centre that would probably feel more at home in
the Midlands or the industrial north. is an odd city to be in Devon.
It has managed in the past to combine the demands of an important regional
and industrial centre with one of the most enviable environments in Europe.
The balance between the two faces of Plymouth has not always been easy to
maintain, but it is becoming increasingly vital to do so.
It offers a curious mix of engineering and high-tech industries - along with
a flourishing tourist trade based on its spectacular history as the port
from which the Pilgrim Fathers sailed to colonise the New World, and Sir
Francis Drake set out to defeat the Armada after completing his leisurely
game of bowls.
Plymouth desperately needs new jobs for its growing numbers of unemployed.
It needs also to attract trade, through continued growth of tourism.
The city, which regards itself as the regional capital of the south-west,
has been hit economically by a double blow. The recession has had as much
impact as in other parts of the country; there have been closures and
redundancies and a slow-down in inward investment. But in addition, Plymouth
has been hit severely by the rundown in defence industries - the impact of
the peace dividend. Plymouth's economy is still highly dependent on the
naval dockyard at Devonport, the largest in Europe. Jobs in the dockyard
have spiralled down from 13,000 to 5,000 in the last six years. It seems
likely that they will fall further.
Unemployment, approaching 14 per cent, puts Plymouth into the top 20
economic blackspots in the country, and it has the fastest growing jobless
rate of any big UK city. However, there is now another black cloud hanging
over the city: the indication is that vital nuclear submarine refit work is
likely to be concentrated on a single site in future. Essentially this means
that a choice will be made by the government in the next few weeks between
Devonport and Rosyth in Scotland, the only other royal dock.
Earlier this year the city council, local business leaders and DML (a
private sector consortium put together by BICC, Weir Group and Brown &amp; Root,
which has run the dockyard since 1987) launched a campaign to lobby the
government on behalf of Plymouth.
It warned that failure to secure the nuclear work for Devonport would result
in the dockyard's eventual closure. This would mean a knock-on effect on the
15,000 defence related jobs throughout the area, which amount to 3 per cent
of the total workforce. In addition, up to Pounds 1bn would be extracted
from the local economy.
DML has been trying to diversify by taking on work for British Rail and,
among other projects, by refitting luxury yachts, but compared with
refitting nuclear submarines at up to Pounds 100m a time, alternative work
is small beer.
The loss of the refit contract would be a body blow - particularly after the
disappointment of failing to win the government's City Challenge competition
earlier this year, when a series of ambitious projects to rejuvenate
run-down waterfront areas were proposed.
However, there is evidence that the launching of the City Challenge bid did
a lot to draw the Labour-led city council, private sector businessmen and
voluntary bodies together and the intention is to build on this new
partnership.
As a consolation prize, the government is to establish an Urban Development
Corporation with a budget of Pounds 45m over five years to develop the Royal
William Yard on Plymouth's waterfront, which is being handed over to the
city by the Ministry of Defence as surplus to requirements.
This new initiative is likely to be the catalyst for the redevelopment of
large sections of the waterfront as part of a broadening of the local
economy. It is particularly welcome, as the city has run out of development
land, but there are problems.
The magnificent dock buildings, built in 1825 to supply the fleet, are Grade
I listed. Recent decades have brought neglect; their refurbishment will take
a big slice of the available funds.
Plans are being co-ordinated by the Groundwork Trust with the help of the
city council and local businessmen. But access is difficult through the
narrow streets, and it is unclear what will be the most effective use for
the site.
Some progress has been made in diversifying the economy. Among the most
successful locally-based companies are Wrigley, the chewing gum
manufacturer, which has defied the recession with successive production
records; Toshiba, the television manufacturer, and Murata, the
Japanese-owned high-tech producer of ceramic capacitors.
The city is also trying to attract more service industry jobs - an area
where it has been overshadowed by Exeter. It has built a Pounds 30m complex
containing a concert hall, skating rink, 'tropical' swimming pool and
conference facilities.
The dual purpose of the Pavilions complex, the biggest capital project ever
undertaken by the city council, is to bring in more business by promoting
Plymouth as a regional conference and exhibitions centre, and to add to the
city's all-year leisure facilities for tourists as well as residents.
Much hangs on the imminent submarine refit decision, but the city is taking
steps to minimise the impact of further losses in defence-linked industries.
and to ensure that alternative employment is found.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (1): A question of character - Devon's
previous over-reliance on agriculture, tourism and defence has been
lessened. Improved links with the rest of the UK and Europe are still
needed, however, to encourage further investment
</HEADLINE>

DEVON has a dilemma. As economic development planning by local authorities
and the private sector increasingly extends the employment base away from
traditional industries, the problem is how to preserve the county's
essential character.
A number of influences caused the local economy to prosper in the 1980s: the
boom in the UK's national economy; overspill from the overcrowded south east
region; an increase in defence spending, and a growing appreciation of the
importance, for business location, of a good environment.
Changes were launched, seeking to avoid over-reliance on Devon's three
staple industries: agriculture, tourism and defence. Substantial successes
were achieved, particularly in attracting service industries to the Exeter
area and electronics and light engineering to Plymouth.
Then came a series of reverses, and pressures on the local economy again
increased. The county's primary industries took a hammering; tougher farming
and fishing regulations, inaugurated by Brussels, were implemented; tourism
patterns changed as more people travelled abroad; big defence cuts were
introduced.
The 'peace dividend' arising from the end of the cold war, warmly welcomed
politically, has meant a steady rundown in defence related industries which
are particularly important to Plymouth.
Devon has been trying hard to replace these traditional employers,
vigorously encouraging inward investment and new business start-ups to
create a broader spread of economic activities.
Recession has clearly affected the effort, as it has in the rest of the UK.
But there are signs that the diversification already achieved has lessened
the impact of the recession on Devon. The county should now be well placed
to take advantage of any economic upturn.
However, there are longer term problems which remain to be solved. A variety
of influences are all likely to have a significant impact on the development
of the local economy: Devon's geographical position on the UK's southwestern
tip; the challenge of competition from the forthcoming Channel tunnel;
liberalisation of eastern Europe, with its low wage economies; introduction
of the single European market.
There is increasing concern that, as the UK integrates more with continental
Europe, areas such as Devon might be perceived as being increasingly
peripheral - and might lose out accordingly, in terms of new investment and
companies relocating to areas closer to - or actually on - the European
mainland.
The recession has added urgency to the task of reshaping the local economy,
now being addressed by both the local authorities and the private sector
with a mix of measures designed to ensure that Devon offers the right
facilities and employee skills when investment confidence picks up.
Mr Richard Clark, chief executive of Devon county council, says: 'We have to
maintain the health of our traditional industries but we also need to
attract new employers and improve our links with the rest of the UK and
Europe.'
Mr Clark believes that greatly improved communications, including faster
road and rail travel, an excellent education system (the county now has two
universities - Exeter, and the recently upgraded polytechnic at Plymouth)
and the county's well regarded quality of life will all contribute towards
widening its employment base.
One difficulty has been that Devon has lacked a consistent voice. A plethora
of organisations meant that potential target companies became confused - and
the county's message dissipated. Attempts are being made to deal with this
criticism by setting up a powerful West Country development agency along the
lines of those for Scotland and Wales, charged with devising a single
development strategy.
Responsibility for promoting and developing the local economy is now
spearheaded by the local authorities - which have a reputation for being
pro-active - by the Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau, which has
responsibility for inward investment from overseas, and by the Devon and
Cornwall Training and Enterprise Council (TEC).
The TEC, established in 1990 as a private sector body responsible for the
local delivery of training and business development initiatives, is one of
the biggest in the UK, directing money and expertise into a wide range of
services. Mr Eric Dancer, chairman of the TEC and managing director of
Waterford Crystal, says there are enough people in the area who understand
the challenges - and the priority which must be given to creating new jobs.
'We have to stimulate economic development as our number one priority, and
that means shouting hard . . . people in the rest of the UK do not always
see us as we are. They see a holiday area, and tend to gloss over the
problems we face.'
There is often less of a problem with potential overseas investors - once
the initial perception of Devon on the fringe of Europe has been overcome.
Since its inception in 1985, the development bureau has attracted projects
creating 3,000 new jobs, and safeguarded 2,000 existing ones.
Some important Japanese and US high-tech companies have been enticed into
the region, and Mr Ken Martin, chief executive of the bureau, is now setting
his sights on Europe - particularly Germany. Relatively few European
companies have considered Devon, or, indeed, the south west region, as a UK
base.
But many jobs are required to make good the current and potential losses
from the cutbacks in defence spending. Many parts of the south west, and
Plymouth in particular, have suffered significantly; there is little
prospect of a reversal. Employment at Devonport dockyard, for example, has
slipped steadily from 11,000, when its management was taken over in 1987 by
DML, a private consortium, to 5,000.
To add to local worries, rumour is rife that nuclear submarine refitting
work will be concentrated in future at a single UK yard - Devonport could
lose out to its rival, Rosyth dockyard in Scotland. Plymouth City Council
and local business leaders warn that this would be disastrous for the whole
area, resulting in the possible closure of the dockyard, with the knock-on
loss of 15,000 jobs among local suppliers.
The county council has just applied to the Department of Trade and Industry
for the retention of assisted area status for Plymouth and Bude, and for its
reintroduction for Barnstaple and Ilfracombe, Bideford, Torbay, and Totnes.
Success would bring substantial grants to improve local infrastructure and
to attract inward investment - along with the prospect of further grants
from the European Community.
Devon is primarily a small business economy, with 90 per cent of its
companies employing fewer than 10 people. There is also a large degree of
self-employment, particularly in agriculture, fishing and tourism.
It has been obvious for years that, to take account of changing economic
trends, there would have to be substantial shifts in the county's
infrastructure. Assisted area status for the less favoured areas would also
help a great deal. The enterprise culture of the 1980s has turned sour, and
the recession has begun to affect the small business sector especially
badly, by sharp increases in business rates, the cutback of capital from
traditional lending sources, a reduction in farm incomes and less spending
by visitors.
The hope is, however, that the recession will be just a temporary blip in
the progress made in reducing Devon's dependence on traditional industries.
The county's strategy is to plan for growth, targeting industries such as
electronics, light engineering, financial services, pharmaceuticals, and
health care, which are environmentally friendly and will not mar Devon's
many - and much-loved - attractions.

crop

FORECASTS OF abundant citrus supplies from Florida this year may be
depressing futures prices but they have cheered officials at the Florida
Citrus Commission.
'We've got 92m trees - the most we've ever had,' said Mr Dan Gunter,
executive director of the Florida Department of Citrus. 'Lower prices make
Florida orange juice an even more attractive, nutritious beverage
alternative.'
Although US growers were braced for lower prices, output is up so much that
they can also expect increased earnings. Some of the higher production will
be disposed of through exports. Japan, particularly, is a growing market for
Florida orange juice.
Florida dominates US citrus output. Last year it accounted for 69 per cent
of US citrus production, while California accounted for 28 per cent, and
Arizona, 3 per cent. Texas is still recovering from several freezes and last
year accounted for less than 1 per cent of US production. Acreage is higher
this year in California and Florida, but lower in Texas and Arizona.
After years of damaging freezes, the citrus growers' luck changed this year.
Hurricane Andrew and a number of punishing tornadoes passed them by. If
winter passes the region by, the state can expect the third largest citrus
crop in its history.
USDA estimated that the crop would produce 186m boxes of oranges, a rise of
33 per cent from last year. The grapefruit crop could hit 54m, a jump of 27
per cent. Production of Florida's specialty varieties - tangerines, temples
and tangelos - is expected to reach 8.6m boxes, up 15 per cent this year.
In 1991-92, the value of the total US crop rose only 2 per cent to Dollars
2.45bn. Higher production during the season led to lower prices received by
the growers. Total citrus crop values increased in Arizona, California and
Texas, while declining in Florida.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian government in a dilemma
over cotton sales
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENCES between farmers and traders and textile mill operators over the
size of this year's Indian cotton crop are making it difficult for the
federal government to keep to its policy of authorising the export of at
least 500,000 bales a year.
The differences as to when the government should take a decision on the
export of new season staple cotton surfaced at last week's meeting of the
Cotton Advisory Board. The farmers, who are expecting a bumper crop of 13m
bales, pressed for immediate release of export quotas to avoid domestic
prices collapsing under the pressure of market arrivals.
The agriculture ministry supports this point of view but the Indian Cotton
Mills Federation, whose initial estimate of the current season's crop is 12m
bales, believes that in the interest of the textile industry, the government
should not make a decision until December, when the exact size of the crop
will be known. The textile ministry agrees.
According to industry officials, the standing crop is likely to be affected
to some extent by the present spell of heavy rain and by pest attacks in
some places.
In the meantime, the government has released an export quota of 126,000
bales of old season cotton for the Maharashtra State Co-operative Cotton
Marketing Federation and Cotton Corporation of India. The decision is being
taken as confirmation that the government is expecting an easy supply
situation in the present season.
Even if the crop is only 12m bales, the total availability for the season
will be 15.3m bales, including the carryover stock of 3.3m bales. The
industry's requirement is estimated at 1.05m bales while another 800,000 or
so bales are generally needed by the non-mill sector.

GOLD fell again on the London bullion market yesterday, adding to Monday's
losses. The recent failure to break conclusively through resistance above
Dollars 350 a troy ounce has effectively capped the upside for the moment,
analysts say. If US funds now abandon positions established in the wake of
Europe's currency crisis - in spite of the likely volatility in financial
markets as the US elections approach - then gold could fall back to Dollars
340 and possibly August's lows at Dollars 335. The market could find some
support if the Bundesbank moves to cut interest rates tomorrow as rumoured
in the currency and equity markets. London COCOA prices reversed direction
in the afternoon, closing down. Dealers said there had been talk of light
selling of Ivorian cocoa with a modest strengthening in the value of the
pound versus the French franc making prices more attractive. COFFEE futures
finished easier, but above the day's lows, aided by the reversal of an early
fall in New York.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US water plan could leave crops
high and dry - Reform proposals that are pitting farmers against
environmentalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIAN growers stand to loose a significant portion of the federally
subsidised water supplies they use for irrigation if President Bush signs
into law a Bill that was passed by the US congress last week.
The Dollars 2.4bn Omnibus Water Bill provides funding for numerous
politically popular projects including dams and canals in Colorado, Utah ,
Arizona and other states.
In California, however, it is highly controversial, pitting the interests of
agriculture against those of urban water users and environmentalists.
The primary impact of the Bill would be to reallocate water supplies from
growers in the prime San Joaquin Valley growing region to environmental
projects. Cities would also gain access to federally subsidised water
supplies.
The legislation addresses a century-long battle over water rights in
California between agricultural and urban interests. At present farmers use
about 85 per cent of the state's water while city residents and other
businesses face severe water rationing after six years of drought.
The Bill would reform allocation of water supplies from the Central Valley
Project, a massive system of 20 dams and miles of canals built by the
federal government in the late 1930s, which transports water from Northern
California to the Central Valley, where it is used to irrigate about 3m
acres of farmland. The system processes about one-fifth of the state's water
supply.
The Bill would reserve 800,000 acre/feet of water per year, or roughly 10
per cent of the water the project delivers in a year of normal rainfall, to
be used to replenish river flows and reservoir levels and to restore fish
and water fowl habitats.
If the drought continues, however, the impact upon farmers could be far more
severe, according to the CVP Water Association. 'We calculate that 2m acres
would have received no CVP water last year and this year if the Bill's
regulations had been in place,' says Mr Jason Peltier, president of the CVP
Water Association.
The Bill would also raise farmers' costs by imposing a Dollars 50m surcharge
to pay for fish and wildlife restoration projects. In addition it would
reduce federal subsidies and introduce a tiered pricing system designed to
encourage conservation. Farmers now pay as little as Dollars 3.50 per
acre/foot for CVP water compared with market rates of about Dollars 150.
Farmers would, however, be enabled under the terms of the proposed Bill to
sell excess water supplies to drought-parched cities and other industries.
Agricultural interests opposed to the Bill claim that it would cost Dollars
4bn in lost income for the state's farmers. 'Federal water cutbacks will
mean idled acreage, thousands of lost jobs and increases in food prices,'
warns Mr Bob Vice, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation.
The farmers , traditionally strong Republican supporters, are urging
President Bush to veto the Bill. They acknowledge, however, that they face
an uphill battle and that political expediency may override the president's
desire to help them.
Mr Manuel Lujan, the Secretary of the Interior, and Mr Edward Madigan, the
Agriculture Secretary, have also said that they would urge a veto, as has
California's Republican governor, Mr Pete Wilson.
The Bill 'would dramatically reallocate 20 per cent of our state's water,
strike a vicious economic blow to California, and create a second century of
California water wars whose only winners will be the litigators,' Governor
Wilson claims.
The immediate problem facing Californian growers is difficulty in raising
loans. 'Lenders are saying that they will only finance growers who have
alternative sources of water in view of the uncertainties about CVP
supplies,' says Mr Peltier.
However, the reforms have broad support from business and environmental
groups in California. 'We are extremely hopeful the president will promptly
sign this legislation,' said Mr Carl Boronkay, general manager of the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves 15m

FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian nickel group announces
cut in output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORILSK, THE world's largest nickel producer, attempted yesterday to steady
the market after the metal's price plummeted again on the London Metal
Exchange following news that LME stocks had reached their highest level for
34 months.
Mr Nickolai Abramov, vice general director of the Russian group, revealed
that low prices and weak demand had forced Norilsk to cut output by 15 per
cent from the 1991 level and further output cuts were planned for 1993 if
demand did not pick up.
Traders were not impressed. 'Production cuts are all very well but nickel is
still pouring out of Russia,' Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at
Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, pointed out.
He suggested that Russia's formal nickel exports were being substantially
augmented by primary nickel alloyed with some iron so that it could be
exported as 'scrap'.
Mr Abramov acknowledged, in a statement to the International Nickel Study
Group meeting in closed session in the Hague, but released to the Reuter
news agency, that there was a serious problem with unofficial or 'grey
market' nickel exports from Russia. 'A strong policy from the Russian
government is necessary to stop the leakage of nickel, copper and
cobalt-containing metals,' he added.
Analysts said the onus remained on nickel producers to cut output.
Recently-announced measures by Inco, the Canadian group which is the world's
second-largest nickel producer, to trim 1993 planned output by 18,000 tonnes
was not enough.
Most of its other rivals have said they will not follow suit, at least for
some time, but 'other cuts of 30,000 tonnes are needed, although it's
difficult to see where that will come from,' said Mr Neil Buxton, analyst at
Metal Bulletin Research.
The LME reported yesterday that its nickel stocks had risen by another 1,440
tonnes to 50,850. A year ago stocks were 8,604 tonnes and two years ago only
3,240.
Nickel for delivery in three months, which dropped by Dollars 156 a tonne on
the LME on Monday, fell another Dollars 84 on the LME to close last night at
Dollars 6,447.50, down by another 3.5 per cent in two days.

<TEXT>
A SHARP increase in European Community demand will help boost world soyameal
consumption by 3m tonnes to a record 74.5m in 1992-93, the Oil World
newsletter says, Reuter reports from Hamburg.
Lack of domestic soft seeds is forcing widespread switching to soya in the
EC and the publication expects net imports of soyabeans and soyameal to rise
by 1.3m and 400,000 tonnes respectively in 1992-93.
Oil World puts EC soyabean imports in 1992-93 at 15.1m tonnes, against 14m
in 1991-92, with exports totalling 421,000 against 398,000. EC soyameal
imports are seen reaching 14m tonnes (13.6m in 1991-92), with exports
unchanged at 4m.
Oil World says soyameal demand will also be strong in the US this season,
and offtake is expanding in Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, China
and Mexico.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Safety fears may force Phillips
to advance Ekofisk investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILLIPS Petroleum Norway may have to bring forward investment plans for its
North Sea Ekofisk oil field because of safety concerns voiced by the
Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the country's oil industry watchdog. The
company believes that modifications and new facilities to meet the
directorate's stringent demands will cost several billion kroner.
The prolific field, Norway's oldest, is estimated still to contain about 1bn
barrels of extractable reserves. But the NPD has warned that it could order
closure of its processing and distribution tank by 1995-96 because ageing
technical equipment and inadequate maintenance has rendered it unsafe. Mr
Rolf Wiborg, a senior Phillips Petroleum Norway executive in charge of
drilling and production, said yesterday that he agreed with the
directorate's opinion that minor modifications would not go far enough to
enhance safety of the Ekofisk facilities, which are also plagued by
subsidence.
'Minor modifications of facilities are not going to get us where we need to
be in 30-40 years time,' Mr Wiborg said. He estimated that Phillips had
already invested about NKr60bn (Pounds 5.85bn) in Ekofisk since the field
came on stream in 1972.
At the end of June Phillips established a four-man task force to finalise a
plan for enhancing the field's further development, which was to be
presented at the company's headquarters in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, in
December 1993.
But the directorate is seeking a response from the company by the end of the
month to its warning about a potential closure of the complex, through which
40 per cent of Norway's total production passes.
Phillips will present a plan to the NPD within the stipulated time limit and
it concedes that it will be forced to give priority to work called for by
the directorate. The level of further investment in the field will depend on
to what extent new facilities will be required in addition to major
modifications.
'We need to propose a package which makes sense to optimise the investment
required vis-a-vis long-term maintenance costs and what is left to be
produced from the field,' Mr Wiborg said. He did not believe the expiry of
the production licence in the year 2011 would pose any great problems for
Phillips, which would apply for an extension if necessary.
On the field's subsidence problem, he said Phillips intended to call for
bids next summer for facilities necessary to expand a major water injection
programme.

MOODY'S Investors Service is reviewing the Aa3 senior unsecured debt rating
of Fujitsu, the Japanese computer group, for a possible downgrade, Reuter
reports from Tokyo. About Dollars 1.7bn of debt would be affected.
The action reflects Moody's concern that Fujitsu's low level of earnings and
cash-flow protection for debt may weaken further due to sluggish demand in
its core business of computers and semiconductors.
Mainframe computer and semiconductor markets are experiencing soft demand.

RENOWN, Japan's largest clothing maker which acquired UK fashion retailer
Aquascutum in 1990, incurred consolidated net losses of Y23.11bn (Dollars
192.58m) for the seven months to July. This compares with profits of Y7.39bn
for the previous 12 months.
At the pre-tax level, Renown made losses of Y16.7bn exceeding the company's
forecast of a Y11bn deficit and compares with losses of Y11.8bn for the
previous year.
The losses were due to poor sales, particularly at department stores, and a
rise in depreciation. Consolidated sales amounted to Y115bn, against
Y243.8bn for the previous 12 months. Depreciation of inventories at its
sales subsidiaries increased the group's losses. It also wrote off Y2.5bn of
its investment in Aquascutum.
For the six months to January, Renown expects consolidated pre-tax losses of
Y4.7bn on sales of Y130bn. It expects net losses of Y8.3bn.
The company has changed its year-end to January, and will start a 12-month
accounting year from next February.

<TEXT>
NISSAN, Japan's second-largest carmaker, has strengthened its alliance with
Robert Bosch, the German components manufacturer which has bought a 9.6 per
cent stake in a key Nissan parts supplier.
Robert Bosch, which already supplies Nissan's Japanese and European
operations, paid Y5.14bn (Dollars 43m) for the stake in Unisia, a Nissan
affiliate.
Nissan and Bosch in July announced plans to merge Unisia and Japan
Electronic Control systems, which is 12.5 per cent owned by the German
group.
By investing directly in Unisia, the German company will raise its stake in
the merged company from a planned 2.7 per cent to about 10 per cent.
Nissan's stake in Unisia, which was spun off from Nissan in 1956, will fall
from 33 to 24 per cent.
The merged company is expected to become a leading supplier to Nissan in the
next few years, by combining Unisia's brake and engine technology with
Bosch's engine control electronics. The merger is a significant step in
Bosch's relationship with Nissan because it will expand its role as a
supplier from alternators into the development of key electronic systems for
Nissan cars.
Kao, a leading Japanese household products maker, is acquiring Chemische
Fabrik Chem-Y, a German chemical company, from DSM Fine Chemicals of the
Netherlands, for an undisclosed sum, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Chem-Y,
which makes agents used in cosmetics, detergents, metal processing and
starch processing, is capitalised at DM10.4m (Dollars 7.30m) and has annual
turnover of DM50m.

FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Arnotts shares soar after offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Arnotts, the Australian biscuit-maker, jumped by ADollars 1.15 to
ADollars 9.15 yesterday, suggesting that an offer of ADollars 8.80 a share
by Campbell Soup, the US foodmaker, was too low to attract most major
shareholders.
However, analysts said the offer, which values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn
(USDollars 0.85), may be sufficient to increase Campbell's shareholding from
32.9 per cent to 50.1 per cent, subject to approval from the Foreign
Investment Review Board (FIRB).
Mr David Johnson, Campbell chief executive, said the offer was fair, and
ruled out a higher bid. He described suggestions by Arnotts' adviser that
the company was worth ADollars 12 a share as 'unreasonable'.
The board of Arnotts confirmed that directors would make no official comment
on the bid until after a board meeting today. However, Mr Sandy Dawson, a
shareholder and former chief executive, said the offer was too low.
Mr Dawson suggested Campbell would dispose of its shareholding at a
substantial profit if the bid stimulated a rival offer from another company.
However, analysts said Campbell was unlikely to withdraw.
Campbell says it wants to use Arnotts to launch a range a biscuits in the
growing markets of south-east Asia, but needs full control to justify making
available technical and marketing skills.

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS Corporation expects credit rating agencies to upgrade its debt to
investment rating within six months, Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief
executive, told shareholders at the annual meeting.
Mr Murdoch said the international media group's bank debt had been
'dramatically reduced' to bring debt maturities in line with operating
cash-flow, which would cover all future bank debt repayments.
He also said the group was negotiating a new bank loan at a lower rate of
interest to spread debt maturities. 'That is something that will come in the
next few months,' he said.
Mr Murdoch said News Corp was on the way to 'the high road financially'.
However, he said the group expected zero economic growth this year in the
US, the UK and Australia.
'We are very bearish about the economic outlook. We are not planning at any
point for any improvement in business conditions. We are working on the
assumption of zero growth in all the economies in which we are operating,'
he said.
News Corp recently reported a 65 per cent increase in net profits to
ADollars 531m (USDollars 379m) for the year to the end of June,
demonstrating a dramatic improvement in profitability since the completion
of a ADollars 7.6bn refinancing in February last year.
Mr Murdoch said he was unable to confirm analysts' forecasts that News Corp
would double its profits in the current financial year. However, he said the
downward path of interest rates and the improving profitability of core
businesses made him 'very confident' of the group's future performance.
'We ran down a long way, we fought our way back and we expect to have an
investment grade rating . . . within six months,' he said.
News Corp last month announced a twin-pronged debt reduction programme
consisting of a worldwide issue of 40m ordinary shares to raise USDollars
690m and a USDollars 1bn issue of senior debt securities.
Moody's Investors Service recently upgraded ratings for some of News Corp's
long-term debt, and the group has been placed on creditwatch for a positive
upgrading by Standard and Poor's. Mr Murdoch said the the US would continue
to provide the largest share of News Corp profits.
Twentieth Century Fox, the group's film-making arm, expected to release
several successful films over the next six months.
Mr Murdoch said News Corp's five national UK newspapers were doing well
despite the difficult economic climate.
'We don't like to admit that the current recession is any excuse for not
doing very well,' he said. 'But let me tell you times are pretty tough in
Britain at the moment.'

MOTOROLA, the US elec-tronics manufacturer, reported a 38.7 per cent jump in
third-quarter earnings, boosted by strong demand across several product
segments in international markets.
Net earnings for the period rose to Dollars 129m, or 97 cents a share, from
Dollars 93m, or 70 cents, in the same quarter last year. Revenues rose 24
per cent to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 2.75bn.
Motorola said sales of its semiconductor products advanced 24 per cent to
Dollars 1.5bn in the quarter. Orders increased in the Asia-Pacific region,
Europe and the Americas, but were flat in Japan.
In the communications segment, sales were up 20 per cent to Dollars 1.04bn,
while computer systems sales jumped 42 per cent to Dollars 932m. The company
said demand for its digital wireless communications products rose in Asia
and the Pacific regions as well as Europe.
'The order growth in most of our businesses makes us optimistic about the
future,' said Mr George Fisher, chairman. 'About half of our sales are in
international markets, and we are seeing especially robust results in the
Asia-Pacific region outside of Japan.'
'While worldwide macroeconomic signals remain mixed, the outlook for growth
in the product markets we serve is brighter.'
The company said domestic orders rose in all major markets except the
government, where electronics group's sales declined 5 per cent.
For the first nine months, earnings increased to Dollars 402m, or Dollars
3.02 a share, from Dollars 328m, or Dollars 2.48 cents in the corresponding
period last year. Sales were Dollars 9.59bn, against Dollars 8.3bn.

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the South Korean steelmaker,
yesterday approved a proposal to allow foreigners to acquire up to 8 per
cent of the state-affiliated company.
Individual foreign investors will not be allowed to have a shareholding of
more than 1 per cent under the amended by-law, which becomes effective
today.
The Korean government, which controls 35 per cent of Posco, opened the
company to foreign investment to try to revive the country's sluggish stock
market by attracting more capital from abroad.
The extraordinary shareholders' meeting also approved the appointment of Mr
Hwang Kyung-ro, the vice-chairman, as the Posco chairman. He replaces Mr
Park Tae-joon, who resigned last week for political reasons and becomes
honorary chairman.
Mr Chung Myung-sik, Posco president, was promoted to vice-chairman, while Mr
Park Tuk-pyo, vice-president for strategic planning, will become president.
Mr Hwang said his goal was to make Posco the world's biggest steelmaker by
1996 by increasing exports, which now account for 30 per cent of the
company's production.
Export growth will focus on south-east Asia, already Posco's second-largest
foreign market after Japan, and China.
Posco will also build a steel plate mill in Shanghai and steel service
centre in Dalian.
Analysts predict that Posco's sales and earnings will remain flat this year,
but profits could grow by 40 per cent next year to Won210bn as financial
costs decrease due to the completion of the company's production facilities.

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Australia Bank (NAB) may withdraw its NZDollars 1.5bn (USDollars
813m) bid for Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) if there is a public inquiry into
the target bank, Mr Don Argus, NAB chief executive, said yesterday.
He was responding to demands for an inquiry into BNZ's operations and
alleged secret deals between 1986 and 1991, for which the bank disclosed
losses of at least NZDollars 2.5bn requiring taxpayer support.
Mr Argus said similar inquiries into Australian banks had been costly,
debilitating, and had seen these banks lose their way.
He said an inquiry into BNZ had the potential of severely damaging its
franchise in the New Zealand market and its value to NAB. It might force NAB
to decide to 'go home. But I hope commonsense prevails, and no enquiry is
held'.
Mr Argus' comments are similar to those made by Mr Lindsay Pyne, BNZ chief
executive, who on Monday warned that the campaign was putting the bank at
'risk'.
The New Zealand Securities Commission will today review its previous
decision that there was no need for an inquiry.
The campaign for an inquiry began late last year following the sacking of
the former minister of Maori affairs, Mr Winston Peters, who has since
become a critic of the government.
Mr Peters has led a high profile public campaign to force the government to
hold an inquiry into BNZ. He has released a steady stream of leaked
documents in parliament, alleging misdemeanours by directors and others.
A key target for Mr Peters' campaign is the prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger,
who since the 1991 election has refused to hold an inquiry.
On Monday, Mr Pyne, in a bitter attack on Mr Peters, said an inquiry would
undo the three-and-a-half years spent rebuilding the bank, would cost up to
NZDollars 30m and last up to 18 months.

<TEXT>
HONEYWELL, the US controls group, yesterday reported third quarter net
income nearly doubled, but the increase was due to special gains from the
settlement of a legal dispute.
The company made Dollars 170.5m, or Dollars 2.46 a share, compared with
Dollars 79.1m, or Dollars 1.13, in the same quarter of last year.
The latest figures included a Dollars 91.6m, or Dollars 1.32-a-share,
after-tax gain from the settlement of a long-running patent dispute with
camera manufacturers over Honeywell's invention of an automatic focusing
device. They also included a Dollars 5.5m extraordinary loss from early
redemption of long-term debt.
Operating profits declined from Dollars 178m to Dollars 169.1m on sales
which rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.55bn from Dollars 1.49bn.
The company's home and building controls division produced operating profits
of Dollars 58.2m, down from Dollars 62.9m. It said this was due primarily to
accelerated investment in new building automation products and the start of
a process to streamline the North American field organisation. Sales rose
9.8 per cent to Dollars 601.8m.
The industrial segment produced profits of Dollars 48.4m, down from Dollars
53.1m, on sales 10.7 per cent higher at Dollars 432.2m. Margins were down on
the same period of last year as customers deferred purchases of industrial
process systems.
For the nine months, Honeywell reported income of Dollars 372.4m, against
Dollars 228.5m last year, helped by Dollars 164m of after-tax patent gains,
partly offset by the Dollars 5.5m extraordinary loss and Dollars 19.3m of
after-tax cost-cutting provisions.
Amdahl the US computer-maker, is to cut its workforce by 9 per cent, or some
900 people, next month, writes Louise Kehoe.
It said the cuts were 'in response to a recent decline in demand for the
company's mainframe computers'.

NINTENDO, the Japanese video games manufacturer, has reached an agreement
with Sony of Japan under which Sony will manufacture and market a new
version of Nintendo's television video game system incorporating a compact
disk memory system.
The new system will play existing games as well as new ones stored on CD-Rom
(compact disk-read only memory) disks. Nintendo plans to make and market a
compact disc accessory to attach to its 'Super NES' game.
The Nintendo CD-Rom system is tentatively scheduled to be launched in the US
and Japan in August 1993.

AMDAHL has become the latest US computer-maker to cut jobs. The
California-based mainframe computer company is to reduce its workforce by
about 9 per cent, or some 900 people, next month.
It said the cuts were 'in response to a recent decline in demand for the
company's mainframe computers'. Last month Amdahl said it expected a loss
for the third quarter.
'We are witnessing a curtailment of capital expenditures and a deferral of
customer buying decisions because of the difficult economic times,' said Mr
Joseph Zemke, president and chief executive.

provision

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, turned in third-quarter net
income of Dollars 14m, or zero cents a share, on essentially flat revenues
of Dollars 3.4bn, reflecting a sharp drop in order rates and a big provision
largely for losses related to an investment in Phar-Mor.
The Dollars 155m pre-tax third-quarter provision included Dollars 100m for
the Phar-Mor investment, and covered increased credit reserves and valuation
allowances at Westinghouse Financial Services.
A year earlier, Westinghouse had a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.48bn,
or Dollars 4.86 a share, including charges of Dollars 1.68bn.
Analysts had expected third-quarter earnings to fall below second-quarter
levels of 35 cents a share, but the erosion was greater than expected.
Westinghouse continues to suffer from the impact of the weak US economy on
many of its sectors, but its financial services operations have been its
greatest weakness.

STRONG results from its gaming business helped Hilton Hotels, the US lodging
company, post a 21 per cent increase in after-tax profits, at Dollars 22.8m.
Earnings per share were 48 cents, compared with 39 cents a year earlier,
while sales advanced by 17 per cent to Dollars 323m.
In terms of operating profits, the gaming division showed a 34 per cent
advance to Dollars 39.9m.
Hilton said all four of its Nevada properties had higher profits, and the
results were augmented by the recently-acquired Reno Hilton.
The hotel side also benefited from the discount air fares available
throughout the summer, which encouraged tourist travel.
In general, Hilton said that it saw higher occupancy rates - percentage
occupancy in its owned or managed hotels rose from 68 to 70 - but admitted
that average room rates were slightly lower.
The results from its Hilton Hawaiian Village property were also
disappointing, with Japanese tourist travel depressed and Hurricane Iniki
also hurting business.
With conditions in New York City remaining 'difficult' and the company
incurring start-up costs on the refurbished O'Hare Hilton in Chicago, the
hotel division overall saw operating profits fall by 5 per cent to Dollars
18.9m.
The third-quarter results bring after-tax profits to Dollars 163.5m for the
first nine months, a 27 per cent improvement on the Dollars 129m seen in the
same period of 1991. Sales are up by 8 per cent, at Dollars 894.1m.

<TEXT>
POLAROID, the US maker of instant cameras, yesterday reported a 25 per cent
improvement in third-quarter operating profits on sales which rose by 8 per
cent.
The company is benefiting from strong overseas business and a favourable
exchange rate.
Net income comparisons for the quarter were, however, distorted by an
extraordinary pre-tax gain of Dollars 925m a year ago from the settlement of
litigation with Eastman Kodak.
Including one-time items, Polaroid had net earnings of Dollars 27.7m, or 59
cents a share, compared with Dollars 582m, or Dollars 10.47, a year earlier.
Operating profit stood at Dollars 59.2m in the latest quarter, against
Dollars 47.2m last year while sales advanced to Dollars 514.1m from Dollars
474.6m.
Overseas sales climbed nearly 22 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 239.2m
from Dollars 196.5m.

<TEXT>
PRIMERICA, the diversified US financial services group, yesterday announced
a 34 per cent increase in third-quarter profits to Dollars 165m, or Dollars
1.46 a share.
Overall revenues, however, fell from Dollars 1.3bn a year ago to Dollars
1.2bn. Primerica was able to post a strong increase in profits because of
lower expenses and investment portfolio gains of Dollars 28.3m during the
quarter.
The company said the one-off investment gains were part of a restructuring
which included a reduction in Primerica's exposure to early paydowns of
mortgage-backed securities, designed to maximise the portfolio's long-term
return.
The best performance came from consumer finance services, which posted a 9
per cent increase in earnings to Dollars 50m, thanks primarily to reduced
costs and lower loan loss provisions. Credit quality improved during the
quarter, with loan delinquencies and charge-offs both down on a year ago.
Insurance services brought in net income of Dollars 45.2m, slightly less
than in 1991. Sales of new life insurance were flat, but mutual fund sales
improved.
Earnings at the group's Gulf insurance property and casualty operations were
Dollars 6m, up from a year ago even though the unit set aside Dollars 2m to
cover losses from Hurricane Andrew.
Smith Barney, Primerica's securities brokerage subsidiary, saw earnings drop
slightly to Dollars 33.4m, with lower trading results, lower net interest
income and higher expenses offsetting gains in brokerage production,
investment banking and asset management fees.
The fall in Smith Barney's profits was expected in the wake of the recent
slowdown in stock market activity.
Corporate expenses fell sharply to Dollars 11.6m in the quarter, due to
declining interest rates and lower debt levels.
Primerica's earnings were in line with expectations, and its shares eased
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 42 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
SPRINT, the third-largest long-distance telecommunications group in the US,
yesterday reported an 18.5 per cent increase in third-quarter net income,
helped by record long-distance volume and operating income.
Net income was Dollars 115m, or 52 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars
2.33bn, compared with income of Dollars 97m, or 44 cents a share, in the
same period last year on revenues of Dollars 2.21bn.
The latest figures excluded a Dollars 6m charge for the early retirement of
debt.
Long-distance operating income was Dollars 94m, up from Dollars 90m a year
ago, mainly because of increased revenues, which grew 6.2 per cent from the
third quarter of 1991, to Dollars 1.43bn, and 3.9 per cent, compared with
the second quarter of this year.
Long-distance use was up 6.9 per cent on a year ago and 3.2 per cent
compared with the second quarter.
The company attributed the increases to 'marketing and product strengths and
operational improvements developed over the last several quarters'.
For the nine months, the group reported net income of Dollars 309m, or
Dollars 1.40 a share, compared with Dollars 269m, or Dollars 1.23 a share in
1991.

BOISE Cascade, the US forest products group, yesterday posted a
third-quarter deficit but said its underlying losses had started to reduce.
For the three months to September 30, the company recorded a net deficit of
Dollars 35.2m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, compared with Dollars 14.3m, or 47
cents. Excluding extraordinary items, Boise lost Dollars 1.24 a share last
year.
Sales fell to Dollars 935m in the quarter from Dollars 1bn last time.
Boise, based in Idaho, is still being hit by weak paper prices but said
there were some signs of improvement.
Mr John Fery, chairman and chief executive, said order backlogs in pulp and
paper were relatively firm and the company had announced price increases in
some key grades.
'This emerging trend of improvement, assuming it continues, combined with
continuing cost-reduction efforts under way in the company, should lead to
further improvement in performance,' he said.

ONE OF the potential bidders for Continental Airlines, the US carrier which

has withdrawn from the running.
Benefit Concepts, a New York-based firm which was designing an offer which
utilised employee stock ownership plan debt in conjunction with former
executives of the airline, said it was abandoning the effort because of
Continental's refusal to supply confidential financial information.
So far, three outline investment proposals - from Mr Hurwitz's Maxxam group,
from Mr Alfredo Brener's Houston Air, and from Air Canada in conjunction
with a Texan investment partnership - have met the qualification
requirements.
A deadline of November 9 was for proposals.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Nobel prize winner extended the realm of economic theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GARY BECKER, named yesterday as this year's winner of the Nobel prize for
economics, is proof that economists have more to offer than dubious
forecasts, indecipherable equations and contradictory conclusions about the
behaviour of money and markets.
Revered among his fellow professionals for his seminal work on the economics
of discrimination and human capital theory, the 61-year-old professor at the
University of Chicago has spent the past 40 years extending the discipline
of economics far beyond the world of international trade and finance.
Mr Becker was the first to show that racial discrimination was economically
costly and relied upon the existence of monopoly power. Only companies with
market power could afford to ignore qualified candidates or refuse paying
customers because of their colour or religion. So encouraging competition is
the best way to end discrimination.
He also investigated how we punish criminals and why prison sentences for
unarmed robbery are much lower than those for armed robbery. Mr Becker
argued that the criminal balanced the rewards from crime against the
probability and cost of capture, so not all crimes should receive too tough
a sentence.
Attaching a life sentence to unarmed robbery would reduce the number of
thefts, but it might also increase the number of murders once the marginal
disincentive for petty thieves to use guns was removed.
Mr Becker has also examined the loosening of US divorce laws. Contrary to
conventional wisdom, allowing one party to file a divorce suit rather than
requiring mutual consent has not led to more divorces in states which have
taken this route.
However, as Mr Becker predicted, the size of financial settlements has
fallen sharply now that there is no need for an agreement to the divorce.
Mr Lawrence Summers, an economics professor at Harvard university and
currently chief economist at the World Bank, says that policymakers should
have predicted this result. 'One of the most important unintended
consequences of the divorce revolution in the US - the impoverishment of
hundreds and thousands of children - would have been apparent if they had
studied Becker's seminal approach.'

FT  14 OCT 92 / Producer prices rise by 3.2%: Slowest increase in factory
gate prices for 24 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT received encouraging news on inflation yesterday as official
figures showed that prices of goods leaving Britain's factories rose at
their slowest rate for more than 24 years.
A report from the Central Statistical Office showed that prices for UK
manufactured goods in September were unchanged on the previous month. They
rose by 3.2 per cent in the year to September compared with 3.4 per cent in
the 12 months to August.
Excluding the volatile prices of food, drink and tobacco, the output price
index rose by 0.1 per cent last month, bringing the annual rate of increase
to 2.6 per cent, compared with 2.7 per cent in the year to August.
The prices of imported raw materials and fuels rose by a seasonally adjusted
0.2 per cent in September, compared with the previous month. The figures
provided the first indications of the effect of the sterling devaluation on
September 16.
In markets yesterday, combined with a stronger performance by the pound, the
better-than-expected news on producer price inflation fuelled hopes of a
further cut in banks' base rates from 9 per cent.
An announcement by Abbey National that it was to cut mortgage rates a
further 0.35 percentage points to 9.6 per cent gave a fillip to the FT-SE
100 share index which closed up 27.5 at 2,584.7. The pound, also buoyed by
earlier comments from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that he intended to
pay close attention to the exchange rate, closed up a pfennig in London at
DM2.52. In late New York trading, it was quoted at DM2.514.
But after gloomy news of coal pit closures, job losses and more business
failures, the government suffered further attacks yesterday for its handling
of the economy. Lord Prior, a former Conservative cabinet minster, accused
the Treasury of failing industry and warned of 'serious social problems' as
unemployment continued to rise.
The government was also criticised by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of
the CBI, who said businesses were increasingly frustrated at the lack of a
thought-out industrial strategy: 'We support the government's anti-inflation
stance and we support the government's aspirations to be at the heart of
Europe. But what we have been asking for time and time again is some
recognition that the government needs to set priorities for growth which
will address the underlying weaknesses of the economy.'
The 0.2 per cent monthly rise in the prices of raw materials and fuel
followed a 0.7 per cent fall in August. The full impact of more expensive
imported commodities, however, has yet to feed through. It is likely to be
felt over the coming months but the increases will not be passed on
automatically to finished goods. With consumer demand still very weak,
manufacturers are expected to absorb the higher costs generated by the
pound's devaluation.
'The input index will pop up quite sharply over the next few months, but it
will take a while before manufacturers pass that through,' said Mr Kevin
Gardiner, economist at SG Warburg Securities.
On an annual basis, input prices continued to fall albeit at a slower rate.
In the year to September the prices of raw materials fell by 0.4 per cent.
This compares with a fall of 1.5 per cent in the year to July and a fall of
1.1 per cent in the year to August.

FT  14 OCT 92 / EC and US closer to farm trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community and the US have all but resolved two of the three
remaining disputes over subsidised farm trade, according to EC officials.
Hopes are high that this could soon clear the way for agreement on the
Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation talks under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, despite intense lobbying by farmers on both sides.
According to senior EC officials and leaders of the US Farm Bureau, the
influential US farm lobby, Washington has agreed that compensation to
European farmers for big price cuts agreed in May's reform of the EC farm
regime will be exempt from the Gatt requirement to reduce overall domestic
subsidies by 20 per cent.
The Uruguay Round 'final act' will be rewritten to reflect this
breakthrough, which nevertheless must be endorsed by the other Gatt
negotiating participants, which number 108 in all.
The two sides are also now examining the legal texts of three formulas for
cutting subsidised exports by up to 24 per cent. According to one senior
official, this is very close to being agreed.
They still differ, however, on the extent to which the EC must cut its
oilseeds output to comply with a separate Gatt ruling. The main problem here
is that the US is not confident that the EC's farm reform can deliver
sufficient cuts.
Talks in Brussels between the two sides' top negotiators were suspended late
on Monday night after 21 hours, with both sides divulging nothing except
that the gap between them had narrowed.
It is now clear that a deal could have been clinched then, but for last
minute pressure from the US Farm Bureau. Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the
Farm Bureau, agreed yesterday that he had been 'kicking his heels' in
Brussels on Monday.
Meetings are planned between Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs
commissioner, and Mrs Carla Hills, US special trade representative, in
Ontario at the weekend, and between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture
commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, probably next
week.
Officials from both sides say agreement has to be reached before the US
presidential election on November 3 if the round is to be concluded.
The betting in Brussels is that President George Bush would like to announce
an agreement on the Uruguay Round in the week before election day.
The EC is under strong pressure from France to concede nothing to the US
which will affect its cereals exports, pressure which will be highlighted by
today's 'day of action' by protesting French farmers.

FT  14 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop seems to find selling soap a lot easier than selling shares.
Yesterday's interim results showed turnover continuing to grow, but the
long-term fall in return on capital is worrying. The City is uncertain about
the full extent of the company's problems, but the difficulties of a go-go
retailer overreaching itself are all too familiar. Saturation has been
reached in the UK earlier than expected and Body Shop faces copy-cat
competition from Boots and others, putting its premium pricing under threat.
True, there were some special factors behind the 42 per cent fall in UK
profits, but confusion about the company's response to the decline is
unsettling.
As with many companies which have grown rapidly, issues such as working
capital and stock control have had low priority. While profits are growing
exponentially, that may be excused; once growth slows firm financial
controls become central to success. Were Body Shop to acquire a strong
finance director, many fears might be allayed.
That said, the company has a brand name with genuine international appeal
and a proven ability to make money overseas. Its franchising system also
avoids many of the pitfalls which have befallen other retailers abroad. In a
sector struggling to make progress the potential for international growth is
seductive. After recent falls the shares now stand at a mere 10 per cent
rating premium to the sector. The brave may see a buying opportunity; the
wary may recall Next and Ratners.

FT  14 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The electricity regulator yesterday delivered a timely reminder of his
ability to spoil the power generators' party. PowerGen was due a sharp
ticking-off for abusing its position in the electricity pool last year. A
pointed reminder of the possibility of a full monopolies commission inquiry
by 1995 was unexpected in the context of what was otherwise a narrow,
technical report. By going out of his way to link an inquiry to the
generator's prices and profits, Mr Littlechild touched on the most sensitive
point of an industry doing very nicely without price-based regulation.
On a bearish view, the threat of price controls in the constrained sector of
the electricity market - the occasional generation of additional power at
premium rates to meet demand surges - might be interpreted as the thin end
of the wedge. Dark mutterings about forced changes of ownership in this area
add to the suspicion that the regulator sees the industry's broader
structure as flawed.
The outperformance of National Power and PowerGen shares this year has been
based squarely on anticipation of a favourable coal contract with British
Coal, backed by supply agreements with the regional electricity companies.
This is still likely, despite the delay. A small yield discount to the
market, though, relies on faith that the generators can cut costs and
maintain prices without interference.

September's producer price figures already show some impact of devaluation
on input costs. Two thirds of the 0.6 per cent monthly rise was accounted
for by higher prices for petroleum products and the 'other imported
materials' category. No doubt the increases will accelerate in coming
months. But the consolation is that the output price figures show how little
inflation was in the pipeline when the sterling crisis struck. The
underlying year-on-year rate of output inflation, which excludes food, drink
and tobacco, is only 2.6 per cent. The monthly rate has been stuck at 0.1
per cent since May.
More encouraging still, the divergence between output inflation and input
prices, which have fallen 0.4 per cent over the past year, suggests
manufacturers have room to absorb higher import costs in their margins -
particularly so given the decline in unit labour costs. After yesterday's
mortgage cut by Abbey National there is ample ground to expect retail
inflation to remain subdued for the time being.
Whether that translates into an early cut in interest rates is another
matter. A poor set of unemployment figures on Thursday would be an obvious
opportunity. But if the Birmingham summit turned out to be a fiasco, the
authorities could then almost immediately find that sterling was again in
sharp decline. They must also be aware that industry will move to recoup any
loss in margins at the first sign of recovery.

FT  14 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: A daring Touche
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fund managers at Henderson and Touche Remnant would surely raise a quizzical
eyebrow if one of the industrial companies in their portfolios suddenly
announced that it was spending the bulk of a Pounds 55m cash hillock in its
balance sheet. It is, after all, no embarrassment in the City these days to
keep a little corporate money in the bank. By marking Henderson's shares 6
per cent higher, though, the stock market obviously believes that there are
valuable synergies to be had from merging two of the UK's biggest investment
management groups.
It is hard to make a firm judgment without the final price. The two product
ranges certainly appear complementary - thus boosting overall earnings
quality. Touche should bring a touch of class to the combined investment
performance. Henderson may be on the way back, but it has been through a
desperately rocky patch. The vital question is the scale of available cost
cutting which, failing a sustained bull market in equities, holds the
commercial key to the transaction. On the back-of-an-envelope assumption
that the Touche price tag might prove to be anything up to Pounds 45m - for
which the bidder would be getting Pounds 18m of cash as well as the funds
under management - Henderson shareholders will hope that Pounds 10m of
savings does not turn out to be an over-ambitious target.
It is fitting, of course, that the deal should have been announced within
days of the fifth anniversary of Black Monday - an event which wiped out
nearly 70 per cent of Henderson's market value overnight and marked such a
sudden change in the group's fortunes. The departure of Societe Generale is
also highly symbolic. It may be that unit trusts will one day be sold in
Lyon and Marseilles, and French Sicavs in Esher and Chipping Norton. But not
yet.

FT  14 OCT 92 / People: Hutchinson quits Nationwide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden departure of John Hutchinson as corporate strategy director at
Nationwide Building Society is a fresh reminder of the shaky state of
affairs at the country's second largest building society. Hutchinson, a
widely admired retail banking specialist, joined Nationwide from Lloyds Bank
three years ago. 'Have they got the right man?' murmurred some building
society chiefs gathered at a conference in London yesterday when the news
leaked out.
The whisper in the industry is that Hutchinson was found to be too
aggressive by the other men at the top of Nationwide. 'John's departure is a
clash between building society and banking cultures inside Nationwide,' one
specialist said yesterday. The society itself refused to comment on the
reasons why Hutchinson has gone or to say how much compensation he has been
paid. Given his star billing in the retail banking world, it can be
confidently predicted that he will reappear before long; some in Lombard
Street do not rule out the possibility of a return to Lloyds Bank.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Management: What price a company car? - Perks / A new series
begins with John Griffiths assessing the number one benefit's real value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The company car still reigns supreme as the most common perk in British
industry. According to the largest-ever survey of employee benefits,
published this week by the Confederation of British Industry, 98 per cent of
companies offer cars to at least some staff.
However, several factors are now combining which could threaten the company
car's supremacy. Recession has deepened, unemployment is climbing and, for
the first time, employers are having to pay National Insurance contributions
on an employee's private use of the company car.
Now there is also the prospect of the personal taxation burden on some car
users increasing sharply. More than 200,000 UK executives driving
high-specification company cars face steep increases in their income tax
bills under proposals from the Inland Revenue, likely to take effect next
April.
For a small minority, the rise could be up to 40 per cent in the tax payable
on the private benefit of their cars - although the Revenue claims that 1.2m
out of a total of 1.9m company car drivers would benefit from the revised
structure.
A growing number of companies, particularly in the financial sector, have
begun offering a cash alternative to employees' cars. Others have 'bought
out' their employees' cars and will no longer offer them to new recruits.
A few of the hardest pressed have even begun thinking the unthinkable -
simply withdrawing cars, with only partial or even no compensation.
Debate about whether the company car - introduced in the mid-1970s as a
'perk' to get round pay freezes - is still worth having has been rumbling
increasingly loudly since the late 1980s, as successive Budgets have imposed
sharply higher taxation on the company car. Until recession bit hard,
however, the debate centred on the benefit or otherwise to the employee,
rather than the employer.
However, companies are now starting to look at the fleet from the
perspective of potential savings to the company itself.
The considerations involved are not only financial. Against all logic,
company cars remain deeply emotive for many of their users at all levels.
Entitlement to a car and the hierarchy of company car models - from a junior
rep's basic Ford Fiesta to the chairman's Jaguar or Rolls-Royce -
increasingly have come to be identified by employees as a talisman of their
value to their company and their status within the pecking order.
This culture is deeply entrenched in a country where nearly half of all new
car sales are made to corporate buyers.
In all too many cases, company car policy has become a time-consuming affair
for boards of directors which, particularly in times of recession, could be
better employed in more productive work.
Even where a company could successfully arrive at a fiscally neutral
cash-for-car compensation deal, other disincentives can come into play. (As
the chart, above, on a range of deals done by nearly 220 companies so far
shows, reaching a sensible figure is more likely to be by accident than
calculation.)
What monetary value, for example, would most employees privately put on the
'no-hassle' aspects of their company cars?
Endless motor trade surveys have shown consistently that most private car
buyers loathe the new car purchase ordeal and the trade-in or private
disposal haggle even more. What price is to be put, too, on regular
maintenance and servicing?
It is considerations such as these which are giving companies such
difficulty in deciding whether they should 'buy out' company cars, maintain
the status quo, or seek better cost-saving alternatives.
National Westminster Bank, which operates one of the UK's largest and most
diverse company car fleets of 11,500 vehicles, has decided to retain its
fleet but run it it more efficiently.
According to Peter Parkinson, head of Natwest's group vehicle purchasing,
the effect of new policies has been profound. In little more than 18 months,
Natwest has saved Pounds 20m, or nearly Pounds 1,750 per vehicle, he says.
Bespoke computer software has been written to help track costs. Purchasing
by individual subsidiaries has been ended and, instead, the group's overall
buying muscle has been harnessed.
Out has gone the previously entrenched culture of allowing 'user-choosers'
at all levels to pick their car from an approved list of 29 manufacturers.
Now there is a list of only seven manufacturers and Parkinson and his team,
rather than users, specify the model and level of equipment in the cars. The
choice is determined not by initial purchase price or discounts but by
whole-life costs.
It has scrapped fixed replacement cycles to take advantage of market swings
 -and auction companies selling Natwest's old cars no longer set the
reserves themselves and simply send in the resulting cheque.
Senior managers are having their Granadas replaced by Sierras. More
economical diesels, with their stronger resale values, are being introduced
progressively.
For more junior managers, two-litre cars are becoming 1.6-litre models.
Overall, 94 per cent of the fleet is now chosen by Parkinson and his
cohorts.
Parkinson, while admitting that there was a hostile reaction within the
company, says it has not reached overwhelming proportions.
Other financial companies, most with a high proportion of 'perk' cars - and
many of them covering low mileages and thus subject to the highest rates of
personal taxation - have decided to end car provision altogether.
JP Morgan replaced its cars with allowances ranging from Pounds 4,300 to
Pounds 6,700 a year, while Bankers Trust has been phasing out its 420 perk
cars with cash alternatives of up to Pounds 7,480.
Midland Bank has taken yet another route, offering staff a cash alternative
of up to Pounds 650 a month if they moderate business mileage. Those
covering high mileages - above 18,000 a year on businesses - have to use a
company car.
For the very highest users, paying an employee mileage can work out more
expensive than supplying a car.
Companies may also find themselves having to deal with an image problem if
senior staff turn up at clients' premises in 'old bangers'.
In seeking to arrive at a sensible vehicles policy for his own company, Tony
Leigh, facilities manager for the Air Call Communications group, has become
convinced that there are no easy formulas for companies to follow in trying
to arrive at car policy decisions.
There is no option but for each company to undertake a detailed analysis of
its own and employees' positions, he says.
'In recent years,' he told a conference recently, 'a plethora of computer
models have appeared to provide the ultimate solution. Many have been
developed by accountants and economists.
'I am tempted to ask whether recent events have shown either to be capable
of running a country's economy, let alone something as complicated as a car
fleet.'

FT  14 OCT 92 / Management: Never mind the customer, just feel the quality -
Companies introducing TQM schemes for all the wrong reasons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most large companies in the north of England which have introduced total
quality management (TQM) have done so without surveying their customers'
reactions and have failed to use their marketing departments to develop
their internal TQM plans.
Two-thirds have, however, carried out surveys of their 'internal customer'
needs, involving the supply of materials, components and services between
their own departments or divisions.
The inescapable conclusion drawn by John Whyte and Barry Witcher of Durham
University Business School is that much TQM is too internally focused and
not concerned enough with what customers want - the very opposite of what
quality programmes are supposed to be about.
'We believe TQM ideally starts with the external customer - and if it does
not, then the customer quickly becomes the focus of the TQM effect. Only
then does TQM provide real total customer satisfaction,' they say.
Quality, they add, means meeting customer requirements exactly. Management's
role is to act as an enabler, creating the conditions under which total
quality can be sustained. This means commitment from the top to a holistic
approach, breaking down any tendency to divide a business into separate
compartments.
Whyte and Witcher have just published a preliminary paper on a recent survey
they carried out among 235 companies with more than 300 employees, each in
northern England. It follows a similar study they carried out for the
Scottish Development Agency two years ago.
Comparison of the two surveys, however, shows a marked deepening of
understanding of TQM over time. The Scottish survey was carried out when TQM
ideas were in their infancy; Whyte and Witcher say there is a better grasp
of principles now, possibly because TQM consultants have become more
experienced.
They were, however, surprised by most companies' failure to involve their
own marketing specialists in developing their plans. Only 8 per cent did so,
in spite of the knowledge of customers, markets and research which the
marketing specialists ought to have had.
Telling figures in the survey are that only 59 per cent of companies said
TQM involved all departments, only 43 per cent involved more than 90 per
cent of the workforce, while training took less than three days for 41 per
cent and less than a week for another 32 per cent.
Inconsistency was also apparent: although 84 per cent of companies said they
trained for quality improvement and 80 per cent planned for it, somewhat
fewer - 74 per cent of companies - monitored and measured it, and only 61
per cent set targets to achieve it.
Yet the stakes are high: of the 62 per cent which said they measured the
cost of not meeting quality standards, four-fifths estimated this as worth
up to 20 per cent of their turnover.
Most had TQM steering groups, but only 29 per cent involved supervisors in
them, 21 per cent front line operators and 12 per cent union
representatives. On achieving quality standards, only 46 per cent had
reached BS5750 Part 2, although another 33 per cent had reached the
standard's Part 1 level.
Factors impeding TQM were entrenched attitudes, lack of time or resources
and lack of understanding. The main benefits were ranked as improved
performance, better attitudes and customer satisfaction.
In their own defence, some companies told Whyte and Witcher they were using
TQM to put their own houses in order before risking it on their customers.
Ominously, however, the researchers warn that TQM has to deliver. If it
produces diminishing returns, senior managers might weaken their commitment
and look for 'another management fashion' to make an impact.

FT  14 OCT 92 / People: Wyatt - customer-driven at Bull
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Carol Wyatt has been appointed director of product operations for Bull UK,
the British subsidiary of the French computer manufacturer.
Wyatt's appointment - it is a newly created position and she takes charge of
a new organisation - reflects a growing conviction among computer
manufacturers that they should be listening to what their customers want
rather than offering them what technology can provide.
She will oversee the strategic development and restructuring of the
company's product marketing, ensuring that customer requirements are
effectively relayed to product development staff. Wyatt will have charge of
over 100 product consultants with sales, marketing and technical expertise.
Wyatt, now 35, started as a secretary with Texas Instruments, and moved to
sales of personal computers and printers before transferring to Bull  - and
some sales management jobs - in 1983: 'It was a challenge,' she says dryly
of her unorthodox career.
She seems to relish challenges. Her successes include leading the Bull team
which won the 1990 contract for the Inland Revenue's 'terminal of the
nineties' system.

forecasts with 45% rise

<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the US software group, yesterday reported a 45 per cent increase
in first-quarter earnings to outperform Wall Street expectations after being
boosted by strong sales of the Windows software program for personal
computers.
Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 209m, or 70 cents per share, from
Dollars 144m or 50 cents per share last year. Revenues were Dollars 818m, up
from Dollars 581m.
Microsoft's growth reflects booming sales of personal computers in the US
driven by lower prices.
It has proved to be one of the few companies to benefit from the price war
among personal computer manufacturers.
The quarterly results 'reflect continued acceptance of the Windows operating
system,' said Mr Frank Gaudette, Microsoft's executive vice-president and
chief financial officer.
Windows provides on-screen graphics which make personal computers easier and
faster to use and has become the standard operating system for personal
computers.
It is rapidly replacing Microsoft's Dos as the most widely used operating
system.
Sales of applications programs for the Apple Macintosh and the Microsoft
Windows operating system were also strong, Mr Gaudette said.
Total revenues for applications for Windows were 118 per cent greater than
in the same period last year.
Microsoft is preparing to launch a new high-performance version of Windows,
called Windows NT, early next year. This will incorporate features that take
advantage of the improved performance of the latest microprocessor chips.
The new program is geared toward corporate PC users with computer networks.
It will compete directly with AT&amp;T's Unix operating system and its
derivatives.
Microsoft said its research and development costs rose to Dollars 105m in
the quarter, against Dollars 74m in the same period last year. Sales and
marketing costs advanced to Dollars 264m from Dollars 178m and general and
administrative costs from Dollars 21m to Dollars 25m.
Founded in 1975, Microsoft has become the largest producer of software for
personal computers worldwide. Its success has brought enormous wealth to the
company's founder, Mr Bill Gates, who is listed this year by Forbes magazine
as the richest person in the US, with assets estimated at Dollars 6.3bn.
However, Microsoft's dominant role in the software industry has also
attracted the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which is conducting
an anti-trust investigation of the company's activities.
Microsoft has said that it will co-operate with the commission.

<TEXT>
ESPIRITO Santo Financial Holding (ESFH), the Luxembourg-based banking arm of
Portugal's Espirito Santo group, reported a 200 per cent rise in operating
revenue to Dollars 132.6m for the first six months, compared with Dollars
41.6m in the same period in 1991.
The sharp rise in revenue is mainly due to the consolidation of the accounts
of Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), the Portuguese
commercial bank which was taken over by the group when it was fully
privatised last February. The Espirito Santo family owned the bank before
its nationalisation in 1975.
ESFH net income was Dollars 18.6m, up slightly from Dollars 17.8m for the
same period in 1991. The small increase is attributed to the costs of
financing the acquisition of BESCL.

CONSOLIDATED sales of Ciba-Geigy, the Basle-based chemical and
pharmaceutical group, fell 3.6 per cent in the third quarter to SFr4.87bn
(Dollars 3.75bn) due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc against other
currencies and depressed conditions in some group businesses.
However, the group said it expects for the full year 'an increase in profits
thanks to good development of business in the healthcare and industry
sectors and consistent cost management'.
For the nine months, group sales rose 7 per cent to SFr17.13bn. There was no
distortion from currency conversions. Sales of the pharmaceutical division,
the largest in the group, rose 16 per cent to SFr4.7bn. The other health
care businesses posted increases of between 9 and 14 per cent. Sales of the
agriculture division division were flat at SFr4.1bn, with the plant
protection business down 9 per cent to SFr3.5bn.

MERRILL LYNCH and PaineWebber, two of the biggest securities houses in the
US, reported strong third- quarter profits despite the slowdown in stock
market activity over the summer.
At both firms, big increases in earnings from capital market trading - some
of it linked to the turmoil in European currency markets last month - and
investment banking helped offset the impact of poorly-performing domestic
stock markets.
The figures delighted investors, with Merrill closing up Dollars 3 1/2 at
Dollars 51 1/2 and PaineWebber Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 18 1/2 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
Merrill announced a 44 per cent improvement in third-quarter profits to
Dollars 230.1m, or Dollars 2.05 a share. It was a record performance for the
period, but still below the record Dollars 277.5m earned in the opening
three months of the year.
The biggest contribution to profits came from Merrill's trading for its own
account, where gains from foreign exchange, swaps and other derivatives
boosted revenues 26 per cent to a record Dollars 610m.
Investment banking was also strong between July and September, with revenues
rising 25 per cent to Dollars 365m.
Asset management and custodial fees climbed 11 per cent to Dollars 212m,
with assets under management at the firm also up 11 per cent, to Dollars
135bn.
Commission revenues rose 8 per cent to Dollars 563m, while net interest
income jumped sharply to Dollars 252m and expenses rose 14 per cent to
Dollars 1.4bn.
It was a similar picture at PaineWebber, where net income rose 35 per cent
to Dollars 51.7m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, following healthy increases in
revenues from investment banking, brokerage commissions, asset management
and principal transactions.
Charles Schwab, a discount broking firm, reported a 41 per cent decline in
third-quarter profits to Dollars 7.8m due to a slowdown in investor
activity.

KONE, the Finnish elevators group, yesterday reported a 19.6 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to FM240.6m (Dollars 51.35m) for the first eight
months.
The result compares with FM201.1m in the same 1991 period, and was achieved
on an 11 per cent increase in sales to FM6.2bn. Operating profits before
depreciation rose to FM548.5m from FM499.3m.
Kone said its elevators business increased sales by 10 per cent, giving it a
72 per cent share. Kone Wood lifted sales by more than 50 per cent and
MacGregor-Navire, the marine technology division, by 23 per cent.
New orders during the period were worth FM5.4bn, up 17 per cent from a year
earlier. This took the value of the group's order book at the end of August
to FM6.8bn, up 12.5 per cent.
Kone said it expected a 'satisfactory' development in its financial result
in the final four months, with sales and the value of orders received for
the year as a whole higher than last year's levels. The company is in talks
to acquire a stake in Pragolift, Czechoslovakia's second biggest lift
manufacturer.

FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Strong profits growth at
Huhtamaki
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HUHTAMAKI, the Finnish consumer products group, announced yesterday a 165
per cent growth in profits (after financial items) to FM281m (Dollars
59.97m) in the first eight months, compared with FM105m in the previous
corresponding term.
Net sales rose 9 per cent to FM4.3bn, while operating income climbed by 77
per cent to FM403m.
Earnings per share were FM7.38, up 169 per cent.
The company expects profits to remain favourable for the rest of the year,
although strong profits growth would slow and the markka's depreciation
would increase financing costs slightly, it said.
The company's three main areas of international operations are confectionery
(through the Leaf group), accounting for 60 per cent of net sales and making
it one of the world's top 10 confectionery producers; food and beverage
packaging in the Polarcup group; and pharmaceuticals, via its Leiras
business.
Huhtamaki's expansion strategy began in 1983 when it doubled in size through
the purchases of three US-based enterprises - Leaf Confectionery, Beatrice
Food and the Donruss division of General Mills. These moves transformed the
company from a group with no foreign export markets beyond the Soviet Union
into an international conglomerate.
Over the past nine years the company has made 40 acquisitions, at a gross
cost of FM3.2bn, and 25 divestments, relieving its net financial burden by
FM1.5bn.
In March, it completed its move out of food production by divesting its 50.1
per cent holding in the Jalostaja food business to Finnish Unilever.
This was followed last July by the transfer of the non-alcoholic and
alcoholic beverages business Marli to the Finnish alcohol group Rettig, in
exchange for Rettig's lozenges business.
Most of the company's FM2.6bn investment programme has been directed into
the North American confectionery business.
This has meant six plant closures and the concentration of production in
Memphis, Denver, St Louis and Centralia, with a cut to 2,300 from 2,800 in
its US workforce. Two-thirds of its confectionery turnover comes from these
operations.
Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, says that Huhtamaki wants to position its
products in 'segments of the market where they do not compete head-on with
major brands and manufacturers.'
A similar pattern can be found in the company's Polarcup packaging group,
which accounts for 21 per cent of net sales and 15 per cent of operating
earnings. In the first eight months, net sales rose by 37 per cent, helped
by the acquisition of the US Sweetheart company.
Polarcup has avoided producing corrugated board and flexible packaging in
order to concentrate on single-use food services and paper and plastic
packaging for dairies and ice cream makers.
In those markets the company has achieved substantial sales in the Nordic
region and central Europe, and also around the Pacific rim.
The Leiras pharmaceutical group is the smaller of the company's three core
areas, with a 34 per cent growth in its exports to FM224m, or 47 per cent of
total sales.
Mr Peltola sees potential for substantial growth in this sector. Two million
women, for example, already use the company's Norplant contraceptive
implant.
Over the past two years Huhtamaki has undergone a period of consolidation.
This may not last much longer, though growth will remain firmly inside the
company's three designated areas.

<TEXT>
Coventry, the sixteenth largest building society, announced pre-tax profits
up by 10.3 per cent, from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 11.8m, in the half year to
June 30.
Total net income rose from Pounds 26.7m to Pounds 27.8m and the pre-tax
result was after a reduction in provisions against loan losses from Pounds
4.42m to Pounds 3.57m, one of the best performances in the industry.
Mortgage advances in the period fell from Pounds 257m to Pounds 241m. Total
assets rose from Pounds 2.12bn to Pounds 2.5bn.
During the half year the society converted Pounds 40m of subordinated debt
into permanent interest bearing shares.

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: FR 6% ahead to Pounds 11m despite difficult
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FR GROUP, the aviation products company, yesterday reported a 6 per cent
rise in profits in spite of difficult conditions for the aerospace and
defence industries in the US and Europe.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June rose from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds
11m on sales up 10 per cent at Pounds 85.4m. Earnings per share increased
from 9.7p to 10.2p and the group is to increase its interim dividend by 5
per cent to 2.46p.
'We have selected the markets we are in very carefully but we are not immune
from what is going on elsewhere in the world,' said Mr Gordon Page, chief
executive. 'But generally speaking we are going for a reasonable year.'
Flight refueling, a growing part of the business, received a boost through
contracts with the Ministry of Defence to convert five more VC-10 aircraft
to a tanker role.
In August FR completed conversion of the first of these aeroplanes; a total
of 13 aircraft are now to be converted.
FR has also just completed the first of four kits for conversion of the US
air force's KC10 to pod refueling capabilities. A decision on conversion of
the remaining 54 aeroplanes of this class is unlikely before next spring.
The group's cash fell from Pounds 7m at the year-end to Pounds 3m after a
planned expenditure programme on the company's fleet of Falcons but also
because of slow and late payment on contracts. Mr Page said he was unhappy
with the cash position but that it would not deteriorate further during the
second half.
FR Aviation has also won a five year contract with the French Navy for
electronic warfare and target towing services.
COMMENT
Already out of favour, defence contractors must be feeling even more put
upon as they contemplate a Clinton victory in the US election. Add impending
spending cuts in the UK and their gloom is complete. FR Group could,
however, benefit. A lot depends on the MOD contracting out more services
like electronic warfare and target towing which FR already supplies the UK
and French navies. Add the potential of a bigger conversion programme for
the US KC10 and C130 and FR could be one of the survivors of the MOD/DOD
shake-out. Such is the nervousness about defence spending, however, that not
much of this is in FR's price. Brokers' forecasts of Pounds 23m for
full-year pre-tax profits give earnings of 21.3p. This puts FR on an average
market yield but a prospective earnings multiple of about 8.4 - more than a
40 per cent discount to the market.

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: William Sinclair advances nine years in a
row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER, profits and dividend have increased for the ninth year in
succession, said Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman of William Sinclair Holdings,
which supplies products to the garden leisure and pet markets. For the year
to June 30 it reported a 3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds
4.48m to Pounds 4.61m.
Mr Sinclair said that gardening was less vulnerable to recession than other
leisure activities and Mr Peter Barton, managing director, pointed to the
ageing population profile and 'green' awareness as other factors in the
group's resilience. The shares rose 13p to 209p.
Turnover grew 13 per cent to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 32.3m) and interest
receivable fell to Pounds 345,000 (Pounds 448,000). A dividend of 5.3p makes
a total of 7p (6.7p).
The garden leisure and professional horticulture side lifted turnover to
Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 23.2m), but saw trading profits slip to Pounds 2.89m
(Pounds 2.96m). Pet, aquatic and household products lifted profits to Pounds
799,000 (Pounds 415,000) on turnover up at Pounds 7.16m (Pounds 4.49m) after
the acquisition of King British and UNO, two aquatic companies, in 1991.
In April the group acquired Secto for an initial Pounds 5m and a deferred
Pounds 1.6m.
Profits in the garden sundries and Silvaperl Industrial division slipped to
Pounds 579,000 (Pounds 659,000) on flat turnover. Farmer Foster, the trellis
and garden furniture maker, was closed since the period-end and provisions
of Pounds 411,000 were taken as extraordinary items.
The group has now been reorganised from three into two divisions.
Earnings fell to 15.7p (17.2p) on capital increased 11.9 per cent by the
Secto acquisition.

Net asset value of London and St Lawrence Investment fell 11 per cent from
140.2p to 124.82p per share over the year to August 31 last.
Again in the light of the high level of income received - gross income rose
from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.23m - it had resolved to pay a special
dividend of 0.48p, although this compares with 0.6p for the previous year,
in addition to a single payment of 3.36p (3.06p) for the year.
Pre-tax revenue amounted to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.1m) and net attributable
to Pounds 827,000 (Pounds 814,000). Earnings were shown as 4.34p (4.27p).

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: A complete package for the holiday industry
 -The growing consolidation of tour operators and travel agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPECULATION that tour operator Owners Abroad is about to be taken over
and the search for a rescuer of the Dan-Air airline appear to bear out the
fervent hope of the large UK travel companies that consolidation of the
fragmented British holiday industry is under way.
After a summer which saw some fierce price-cutting, Mr Charles Newbold,
managing director of Thomson, the biggest UK tour operator, said he would be
happy to see the back of some of his smaller rivals. 'There are certainly
one or two companies that won't survive and the travel business will be well
rid of them,' he said.
The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) says 54 of its members have
collapsed this year.
The largest survivors are buying, or thinking of buying, ever bigger parts
of the business, attempting to establish a presence in all sectors of the
market: arranging holidays, selling them, and flying the customers to their
destinations.
The recent history of the UK travel business suggests, however, that having
a stake in each sector is no panacea. And the industry is no respecter of
size. Last year saw the collapse of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure
Group (ILG), then the second biggest operator. ILG's attempt to build up a
scheduled airline business brought down its aggressive package tour
operation.
The rumoured bidders for Owners Abroad, currently the second biggest UK tour
operator, include Airtours, the third biggest operator, and LTU, a large
German travel group. Airtours last month bought Pickfords Travel, the third
largest UK travel agency. LTU earlier this year bought Thomas Cook, the UK's
second largest travel agency chain. LTU has also been mentioned as a
possible buyer of Dan-Air.
Both LTU and Airtours believe it is important to own companies in all
sectors of the holiday industry. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said
owning Pickfords would enable his group to sell its holidays more
effectively. Mr Wolfgang Osinski of LTU, while refusing to comment on the
group's intentions towards Owners Abroad or Dan-Air, said: 'Offering the
complete product at every stage of the holiday, from the booking to the
airline to the hotel, means you can ensure quality all along the line.'
All three market leaders - Thomson, Owners Abroad and Airtours - have their
own charter airlines. Thomson has owned Lunn Poly, the largest UK travel
agency chain, for 20 years. Thomson and Lunn Poly insist that they operate
at arms length - a claim generally accepted by rival travel companies.
By contrast, Mr David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, made no attempt to hide
the benefits he expects to get from owning Pickfords.
Mr Crossland said that if each of Pickfords' 333 branches took an additional
Airtours booking every week, it would add Pounds 2m to the enlarged group's
pre-tax profits. He said that although the average Pickfords branch had 150
display rack spaces, Airtours brochures occupied only four of them. He made
it clear that the number of Airtours brochures at Pickfords branches would
increase.
Others were less convinced by Mr Crossland's reasoning, and worried about
the consequences of yet another travel agency being owned by a tour
operator.
Travel agents are expected to offer a wide range of holidays from various
operators. Rival tour operators were worried that Pickfords would promote
Airtours' holidays in preference to theirs. Travel agency chains, for their
part, warned that if Airtours favoured Pickfords unduly it could throw into
doubt Airtours' long-term contracts with other agents.
Mr Crossland said he did not think rival tour operators would refuse to sell
their holidays through Pickfords because of its Airtours link, simply
because they would not want to abandon a retail outlet with 333 branches.
Thomson holidays accounted for 20.6 per cent of Pickfords summer business
this year, with Owners Abroad taking 13.9 per cent and Airtours 12.4 per
cent.
As for the other travel agents, they had already demonstrated that, far from
being reluctant to sell Airtours' holidays, they wanted to be sure they
could continue to do so. He added that the combined buying power of Airtours
and Pickfords would also enable them to reduce advertising and marketing
costs.
Mr Peter Rothwell, marketing director of Lunn Poly, said he would carefully
observe the development of Airtours' relationship with Pickfords before
deciding whether its own contracts with the operator could continue. 'I
can't see a change in our relationship (with Airtours) overnight. But our
agreement with them binds both sides. If the other side provides less than
full support to us, the agreement will be broken.'
An additional concern was how consumers' might react. Mr Rothwell said: 'If
I was a customer and I knew I was going to be pushed into buying a
particular product, I would object. A travel agent is respected for
impartiality. That's why people go to travel agents rather than to tour
operators direct.'
Ms Patricia Yates, editor of Holiday Which? magazine, pointed out that some
tour operators already offered travel agents inducements like free flights
and cut-price holidays. 'Obviously, to have another arrangement, like
ownership, is a worry.'
Mr George Marcall, Airtours sales director, insisted the traveller had
nothing to worry about. 'The consumer is king. Whatever the consumer wishes
to buy, we will provide it.'

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cabra to sell two football grounds to third
party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABRA ESTATES, the heavily indebted property company, is negotiating the
sale of two London football grounds to a third party having failed to reach
agreement with Mr Ken Bates, chairman of Chelsea football club.
Mr Eoin Cotter, Cabra's chief executive, said the buyer was 'financially
reputable' and known to the group's two main banks.
The latest borrowings figure of Pounds 52m dates back to March 1991. Since
then, Mr Cotter said, there had been asset sales, including selling an
interest in a residential developer in Houston.
No balance sheet information was issued with yesterday's results from Cabra
for the year to March, although it said its net assets had fallen to less
than half the called up share capital of Pounds 24m.
This followed pre-tax losses of Pounds 22.1m (loss of Pounds 11.3m) and
further writedowns in property values. An exceptional charge of Pounds 13m
was taken to write down Stamford Bridge's value from the previous Pounds
22.85m and also to reduce Craven Cottage's value.
Mr Cotter said that as a technicality an extraordinary general meeting had
been called for November 6 because of the gap between net assets and share
capital.
Turnover fell to Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 54.3m). Loss before exceptionals was
Pounds 9.19m (Pounds 8.03m). The loss per share was 21.39p (loss of 10.2p).
There is no dividend.
One of the possibilities following the grounds' sale is that the buyer will
revert to the plan of trying to get Fulham to share Chelsea's ground,
eventually freeing up for redevelopment the Craven Cottage site
Fulham, however, has reached no agreement with Chelsea and is believed to
interested in buying the Craven Cottage ground. Chelsea's aim continues to
be to buy Stamford Bridge.

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Overseas rise limits Body Shop's decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODY SHOP International, which last month issued its first profit warning
and saw its share price fall by 41 per cent, yesterday spelt out the reasons
for the sharp decline in its UK performance.
Trading profit in the UK slid 42 per cent to Pounds 3.7m in the six months
to August 31, making up 39 per cent of the Pounds 9.56m total, down from
Pounds 10.5m. This was the first time UK profits had fallen behind those
made overseas.
Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said the row with one of the biggest UK
franchisees with six shops in the south of England had cost about Pounds
400,000 in lost profit. By the end of this week all six would be replaced by
company-owned shops.
The relocation of Cos-tec, a cosmetics making subsidiary, had cost about
Pounds 500,000. Other profit reductions were caused by franchisees delaying
Christmas orders and by the transfer of shops from company ownership to
franchisees.
Domestic turnover fell from Pounds 36.9m to Pounds 35m, in spite of 15 shop
openings, taking the total to 219. Sales had dropped off from the middle of
June, said Mr Roddick, and had remained volatile.
The UK setback led to a 10 per cent fall in group pre-tax profit from Pounds
9.15m to Pounds 8.26m, in line with the September 16 warning. Group sales
advanced 6 per cent to Pounds 67.2m (Pounds 63.2m).
Overseas trading profit grew 28 per cent to Pounds 5.1m, excluding the US
where there was an eightfold improvement to Pounds 800,000 and the 100th
store was opened. The US had been organised into four regions each under the
equivalent of a head franchisee.
The number of shops outside the UK grew from 517 to 590. In Asia, including
Japan where there will be 10 shops by the end of the year, sales rose 54 per
cent. Continental Europe grew by 35 per cent.
After capital spending of Pounds 10.7m, net debt rose from Pounds 32m at the
year-end to about Pounds 41.5m, for gearing of a little more than 50 per
cent. The main item was the Pounds 6m purchase of industrial property rights
from Constantine &amp; Weir, a supplier. Total capital spending this year was
expected to fall from Pounds 18m to Pounds 12m.
Earnings per share slipped to 2.9p (3p). The interim dividend is held at
0.68p.

ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and
electronics group, are due to meet tomorrow with Mr Mentes Aziz, the
personal lawyer of Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman, in a bid to gain
access to the assets still held in companies in the north of Cyprus.
Mr Aziz confirmed he was in negotiations with Mr Richard Stone and Mr
Michael Jordan of Coopers Lybrand following earlier meetings in Istanbul
last week. He is also due to meet the Serious Fraud Office on Friday.
On September 23 Mr Aziz appeared before Ms Laura Harris, the SFO director,
and was issued with a 'Section 2' which requires a suspect to answer
questions.
Since the PPI collapse in October 1990, Mr Aziz has taken legal action in
the Cypriot courts to prevent the administrators from gaining control of PPI
assets on the island - Unipac, a packaging company in Famagusta, and Sunzest
Trading, a fruit export concern.
Mr Aziz said he was now discussing an amicable resolution of the dispute.
However he wanted a formal undertaking from the administrators that the
Cypriot companies would not be closed.
'Whether the companies are going to be disposed of, or retained, the
interests of the company and the community must be taken into account,' he
said.

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Weak pound blamed as Wellcome shares flow
back from US market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of Wellcome shares held in American Depositary Receipt form has
fallen since the Pounds 2bn share sale in July.
At October 9, 58.9m Wellcome shares were held in ADR form, 6.8 per cent of
the group's share capital. The pharmaceutical company said that about
another 3 per cent of the shares were held directly.
In the share sale, when Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, sold 288m
shares to cut its stake in the company from 73.5 per cent to 40 per cent, a
total of 70m shares were allocated to the US market.
Before the sale few of the company's shares were held in the US although the
North American market is the largest contributor to Wellcome's profits.
One of Wellcome's objectives in the sale was to increase the proportion of
its shares held there.
Advisers to the sale said that the flowback of shares was disappointing.
They ascribed it to a general trend of selling pharmaceutical stocks by US
investors and to the fall in sterling against the dollar which made UK
shares less attractive to American holders.
Wellcome's shares fell 9p to 954p yesterday, still well above the 800p sale
price in sterling terms, but much closer to the Dollars 15 sale price in
dollar terms.

organic growth
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DORLING KINDERSLEY, the British publisher which specialises in highly
illustrated reference books for international markets, will be floated on
the stock exchange with a market value of Pounds 85m-Pounds 100m.
DK's pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, said the flotation would
raise Pounds 25m before expenses.
The offer price is expected to be announced on October 23, with dealing
beginning a week later.
Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman and chief executive, said the new funds would
be used to continue organic growth, particularly in the US, and to provide
back-up material for the group's educational titles.
Up to 75 per cent of the new shares will be placed firmly with financial
institutions.
The remaining shares will be provisionally placed, but will be subject to
clawback by financial intermediaries for sale to private investors.
The flotation is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with Cazenove as
broker.
DK said its growth in the year to next June was expected to be substantial,
but not at the very high rate of the last five years.
In the 12 months to June 30 this year, the group's pre-tax profits doubled
to Pounds 7.5m on sales up by 66 per cent to Pounds 70.9m.

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fast growth for niche technology / A look
at the development of industrial inkjet printing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINX PRINTING Technologies, a fast growing company nurtured in the
technologically fertile Cambridgeshire fenlands, comes to the stock market
this week in a move which underlines UK domination of the industrial
continuous inkjet printing business.
While nothing can be taken for granted in the present economic climate, the
company is expected to have a market value of between Pounds 20m and Pounds
30m when the shares are priced tomorrow.
Linx is a new star in a fast developing market. Worth about Pounds 220m a
year at present, analysts reckon the industrial inkjet market will continue
to grow by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent a year for the next few
years.
That represents a significant reduction in growth from the exuberant rates
over the past decade as sales generated by consumer legislation in the
European Community level off. The market leaders are actively seeking to
open up new applications and other technologies such as lasers for high
speed printing to sustain growth and profitability.
Market leadership is shared between Domino Printing Sciences, another
Cambridgeshire company, and Videojet, based in the US but owned by GEC of
the UK. Each company has about 27 per cent of worldwide sales and dominates
its local market. A French company, Imaje, is number three with 17 per cent.
Industrial inkjet printing is a niche technology which has so far escaped
the attentions of the big battalions of the electronics industry. It calls
for a complex mix of skills.
The leaders in the industry combine engineering and electronics expertise
with enough scientific knowledge to understand the physics of electronically
charged ink droplets in motion and the chemical skills to cook up a menu of
specialised, sometimes edible, inks.
Among the large electronics companies only Hitachi of Japan with a 9 per
cent market share has made much of an impact. 'It is a sleeping giant that
so far has not woken up,' says Mr Howard Whitesmith, Domino's managing
director.
The principles behind inkjet printing have been known for over a hundred
years, but it was modern legislation which provided the impetus to turn a
laboratory curiosity into a profitable business.
Today's industry grew out of research at the high technology consultants
Cambridge Consultants (CCL) in the UK and Stanford University in the US. In
1976 Stanford designed the first commercial inkjet printer for the US office
supplier AB Dick, now a subsidiary of GEC, which led eventually to the
formation of Videojet.
Cambridge Consultants had been experimenting with similar systems and in
1978, Mr Graeme Minto, CCL's inkjet team leader, left the consultancy and
established Domino to exploit the technology.
The fledgling company was given a powerful boost in 1981 by European
Community legislation which required perishable goods to be printed with a
'best before' date. Only inkjet printing could offer the combination of
speed, flexibility and reliability required.
In 1980, Domino incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 69,000 on sales of Pounds
82,000. By 1984, it was ready to go public with pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.8m on sales of Pounds 7.4m. Last year, it made profits of Pounds 9m on a
turnover of Pounds 60m.
Industrial inkjet printers of the kind made by Domino and Videojet are
markedly different from the office inkjet machines now common throughout the
world. Compared to their industrial counterparts, office printers are slow
and finicky. The geometrical relationship between the print head of an
office printer and the paper has to be exact; fast drying inks cannot be
used because of the dangers of clogging. Their life on a production line
could be measured in hours rather than days.
Industrial inkjets, on the other hand, are designed for the rigours of the
factor floor. They can tolerate distances of several centimetres between the
print head and the target. A stream of fast moving, jostling, mineral water
cans gives them no problems; neither do delicate objects like eggs or wine
bottles. They will print in any direction and on virtually any surface from
a breeze block to a shiny plastic cable cover. Superquick drying or food
grade inks are often the rule rather than the exception.
What makes inkjet printing possible is the speed of modern microprocessors.
A stream of charged ink drops, 60 millionths of a metre in diameter - about
the thickness of a human hair - is ejected continuously from the print head.
Up to 128,000 drops are ejected every second.
The technology makes it possible to print variable information at rates
which match the speed of modern production lines without contact.
Domino now makes about 600 machines a months with an average selling price
of Pounds 6,000. Three-quarters of its systems are sold outside the UK and
it won the Queen's Award for Export in 1987 and 1992.
This year the Royal Mail announced it would buy 500 Domino printers over
three years in one of the largest orders of its kind.
The world of inkjet printing is small and incestuous. Linx, a brasher, more
publicity-conscious company than Domino, was formed in 1987 by Mr Mike
Keeling and Mr Hill Weinberg, both also former employees of CCL. Helped by a
1991 European Community directive which demands that all consumables are
marked either with a sell by date or a lot number, Linx has grown by from a
turnover of Pounds 152,000 and operating loss of Pounds 496,000 in 1988 to
sales of Pounds 6.5m and operating profits of more than Pounds 900,000 in
1991. It too was awarded the Queen's Award for Export in 1992.
Domino and Linx are conscious that the market driven by EC legislation is
now mature and although similar moves are taking place in other countries,
they are nevertheless seeking new ways of sustaining growth. Mr Whitesmith
says that sales are roughly divided between legislation-driven markets and
new areas - this includes, for example, personalising or printing unique
numbers on individual copies of newspapers and magazines.
Mr Whitesmith relishes his story of supplying the late Mr Robert Maxwell
with Domino equipment to print 'bingo' competition numbers on individual
copies of the Daily Mirror - and getting paid before Mr Maxwell's house of
cards collapsed.
He has already diversified into 'Packtrack', a mimeographic carton marking
technology it acquired in a takeover, and is researching a new inkjet
technology which within five years could combine the quality of office
inkjet printing with the speed and reliability of industrial systems.

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: WB Pounds 2m sale as losses rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in WB Industries,the west midlands-based spring maker, fell 7p to 14p
after announcing increased losses for 1991 and the sale of Elson &amp; Robbins,
its profitable unit spring maker.
On turnover down 32 per cent at Pounds 9.67m (Pounds 14.2m) pre-tax losses
were Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 1.59m). The company blamed the recession and its
cash shortage.
Elson is being sold to Wade Group for Pounds 1.94m as the first stage in the
reshaping of WB. In 1991 Elson contributed profits of Pounds 75,000 on
turnover of Pounds 5.47m.
The sale gives rise to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.49m (Pounds
2.33m) relating to losses on businesses sold, of which Pounds 2.28m covers
goodwill previously written off.
A tax credit of Pounds 567,000 this time left losses per share at 70.88p
(218.06p).

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: St Ives rises to Pounds 21m in weak markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST IVES, the UK's largest independent printer, yesterday reported a 4.5 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 21.1m for the
year ended July 31 despite difficult conditions in its core magazine and
book printing divisions.
The result was achieved on turnover lower at Pounds 208.1m (Pounds 217.7m),
mainly reflecting the disposal of several small packaging companies.
Earnings per share grew to 15.2p (14.6p) .The final dividend is 3.75p per
share, making a total of 5.25p (5.0p).
Mr Robert Gavron, chairman, said that most of the group's markets were 'very
weak' but increases in market share, further cost reductions and the
benefits from the group's five-year Pounds 130m investment programme in
plant and machinery all helped underpin its performance.
Gross margins grew from 23.3 per cent to 24.2 per cent while operating
profits increased to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 19.9m) buoyed by lower
administration expenses. Pre-tax profits were also helped by higher net
interest receipts which grew to Pounds 866,000 (Pounds 286,000). During the
year the group financed Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 23.7m) of capital expenditure
from its strong positive cash flow and ended the financial year with no
gearing and net cash of Pounds 13.45m (Pounds 124,000). Having completed its
large capital investment programme, expenditure is likely to average About
Pounds 12m a year in future.
The group's core market in the UK is magazine printing which represents
about 40 per cent of turnover. During the past year reduced advertising
revenues and lower circulation figures have resulted in a contraction of the
market with fewer and slimmer titles.
Mr Gavron said this had inevitably affected both volumes and prices, 'we
have the newest factories and the most modern equipment to serve this
market, yet in spite of this our margins are still well below the levels we
achieved in the 1980s.'
COMMENT
Having completed its huge capital investment programme St Ives now has some
of the most advanced printing plants in the world which are running at about
75 per cent capacity because of the recession. The group's management has an
excellent reputation within the industry and has managed to gain market
share without undermining margins. With no gearing, net cash of Pounds 13m
and a significantly reduced capital expenditure budget the group's balance
sheet is also in good shape. Like most printing companies St Ives has high
operational gearing which would allow it to benefit very quickly from any
volume increase - although there are no signs of this yet. But even without
any economic upturn pre-tax profits should increase to around Pounds 23m
this year and earnings to about 15.9p per share. At current prices the stock
is trading on a premium prospective p/e of about 17, but still looks good
for the longer term. and for its plastic bags.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Fund managers adapt to new imperatives: The dynamics of
talks between Henderson and Touche Remnant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Selling unit trusts to a public now painfully aware of the vagaries of the
stock market is hard work.
A unit trust, like its older cousin the investment trust, offers the average
investor the opportunity to play the stock market without the agony of
picking individual shares.
For the fund management companies that manage these two types of trust,
public anxiety over share prices is not the only worry; they must also cope
with fierce competition.
Recent figures from the Unit Trust Association show that last year the
number of unit holder accounts, at 4.46m, was the lowest since 1987, but the
number of unit trust companies had risen 13 per cent in the meantime, to
157.
'It is no secret that there is overcapacity in this business,' said Mr Ian
Jocelyn, senior consultant at Touche Ross Management Consultants which
recently analysed the unit trust industry.
Its study found that more than half of unit trust companies were operating
at a loss or were earning less than 5 per cent profit on income.
Mr Jocelyn said that, to survive, unit trust companies must build bulk,
either by increasing sales or by merging. Investment trusts have a different
cost structure, but face the same pressure to generate economies of scale.
Faced with the choice of selling more or merging, M&amp;G, Britain's largest
independent unit trust company, is following the first approach: it is
overhauling its sales methods.
The second approach has appealed to Henderson Administration, one of the
main independent fund management companies, which is close to acquiring
investment trust manager Touche Remnant. Together, the two account for 10
per cent of the UK's investment trust market.
For M&amp;G, the need for higher sales is underlined by figures from
Datamonitor, a market research firm. These show that M&amp;G's market share has
fallen in 1992 to 7.92 per cent, from 8.62 per cent five years before.
The group's chief executive, Mr Paddy Linaker, is considering for the first
time the establishment of a direct sales force; he has recruited a sales
chief from Allied Dunbar, one of the Britain's hardest selling life
insurers.
Mr Linaker says the company's sales efforts will be aimed at improving the
servicing of M&amp;G's network of independent financial advisers (IFAs) who
account for two-thirds of its unit trust sales and almost all its life and
pensions products.
M&amp;G already accounts for about 15 per cent of all unit trusts sold through
IFAs; a formidable percentage. Mr Linaker says that, in the long term, he is
concerned about the ability of the IFA sector to keep pace with the
increasing competition from direct sales agents and so-called tied agents,
often building societies who sell the products of one company exclusively.
M&amp;G's shift of strategy emphasises the increasing difficulty unit trust
groups are having in containing the costs of distribution. The Touche Ross
report concluded that all of the unit trust industry's sales methods -
independent financial advisers, direct sales agents or tied agents - are
carried out at a loss. Simply put, this means that the costs of making a
sale are exceeded by the charges levied on customers for it.
The only way to remain profitable in these circumstances is to increase
funds under management and keep each customer longer. That way, annual fees
may rise enough to offset the losses incurred on each sale. If sales cannot
be increased, then merger may be necessary.
There have been no recent mergers of unit trust managers, but the industry
is alive with suggestions that, for some groups, such deals may be the only
escape from the profitability squeeze.
For investment trust managers, by contrast, distribution costs are not such
a headache. Their products, which take the form of shares in publicly quoted
investment vehicles, are largely distributed by stockbroking firms, at much
lower cost.
The drawback of this approach is that it makes it hard to raise fresh funds
for investment trusts when the stock market is weak. That keeps investment
trust groups from growing large enough to achieve the necessary economies of
scale.
Henderson and Touche Remnant have sought to avoid this problem by combining
to form a bigger group with lower cost ratios.
Touche Remnant has had an uneasy relationship with its parent company,
Societe Generale since it was acquired three years ago.
Funds under management at Touche Remnant have fallen, disappointing the
French bank, while Touche Remnant feels it has made little headway in
selling its products in Europe.
Touche Remnant had decided that if the relationship with SocGen ended, there
was no real hope of going it alone.
Henderson has also been losing volume: in the six months ended March 31,
1992, it experienced a six per cent drop in funds under management, although
profitability rose. The company's poor investment performance in the late
1980s has seen the number of its pension clients fall to 168, from 246 in
1987.
The company has fought back by achieving above average investment
performance during the past three years and by entering into a series of
joint ventures and acquisitions. Several of Touche Remnant's investment
trusts have shown above average performance and Henderson is hoping to
capitalise on TR's investment expertise.
The dilemma common to both unit trust and investment trust managers is this:
to achieve adequate profitability, you must sell enough of your products at
an acceptable cost. Unit trusts have achieved relatively high volumes, but
at a cost which risks becoming increasingly unacceptable. Investment trusts,
by contrast, have tolerable distribution costs - but cannot generate the
volumes they need. For independent fund managers in both sectors, the
writing on the wall is clear: only the big survive.

FT  14 OCT 92 / MGN may not be sold for years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR Group Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mirror, may not be sold for
up to two years, senior directors believe.
Executives of the company which was badly hit by 'the misappropriation of
assets' before the death of Mr Robert Maxwell made it clear yesterday they
were managing the business for the longer term.
Signs of stability were underlined by pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.3m for
the six months to June on a turnover of Pounds 233.7m. Earnings per share
were 2.6p, against 8.3p last time. No dividend is being paid nor is likely
before June 1994. The share price fell 2p to close at 63p yesterday. 'This
is not a drama exercise but it is a story we are proud of. The first half in
the circumstances has been very good,' said Sir Robert Clark, MGN chairman.
Sir Robert said no comparisons could be made with the first half of 1991
because the figures were believed to be unreliable but the pro-forma figures
for the year to December 1991 showed the group had pre-tax profits of Pounds
50.9m.
Operational profit was Pounds 49.4m but this was reduced by a Pounds 22.8m
net interest charge, Pounds 2.3m in losses from a stake in Donohue, the
Canadian forest products group, and an allowance of Pounds 9m towards the
deficit in the Mirror pension fund.
Net borrowings, including lease finance for the new presses to be installed
at the Daily Record's Anderston Quay headquarters in Glasgow increased from
Pounds 398.4m at the end of 1991 to Pounds 422.7m in June.
More than 54 per cent of MGN shares are held by Maxwell private companies in
administration but Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator,
repeated that the Mirror stake is not for sale at present. There is board
level speculation at MGN that shares could be offered rather as the Wellcome
Trust sold 20 per cent of the Wellcome drug company.
Combined circulation of the Daily Mirror and The Daily Record stayed ahead
of their rival The Sun but Mr Vic Horwood, MGN chief executive, conceded
that in September the Sun had edged ahead.
Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at Kleinwort Benson expected
full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 35m.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Ice cream maker requests bank to appoint receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HENRY D Clarke Jr's hopes of building a UK ice-cream empire faded
yesterday when Clarke Foods, which he chairs, asked National Westminster
Bank to call in administrative receivers. Mr Ipe Jacob and Mr Neil Cooper of
Robson Rhodes were appointed.
Mr Jacob said he was optimistic that the company would survive through a
restructuring or being sold as a going concern. He said 'most of us have
grown up with Fiesta, Zoom, FAB and Mivvi (some of Clarke's products). It is
important to preserve this essential ingredient of our epicurean heritage.'
A number of interested parties have already contacted him and Guinness
Mahon, Clarke's merchant bank. Guinness Mahon is working on a voluntary
arrangement with Clarke's creditors.
Clarke, which owns Lyons Maid, is the second-largest UK ice-cream maker
after Unilever, which owns Wall's. Clarke employs 650 people of whom 100
were made redundant yesterday.
Its shares, quoted on the USM, were suspended at 8p 10 days ago as the
company sought an equity injection. It had been trying to arrange an
overdraft facility with NatWest to provide working capital finance but
needed to secure further equity finance first.
The receivership is expected to cause a Pounds 7.6m extraordinary write-off
at Hillsdown Holdings, the food group, which sold three ice-cream businesses
to Clarke in March 1991 for Pounds 10.35m, taking an equity stake in return.
Allied- Lyons, the brewing and food group which sold Lyons Maid to Clarke
for Pounds 12m at the end of last year, is still owed Pounds 4.5m.
Mr Clarke, an American ice cream fanatic, built the company out of Yelverton
Investments. He and his family have 25 per cent of the group but any new
equity investor is likely to dilute that stake, and other shareholders.
Clarke had commissioning problems with new equipment in the early summer and
was unable to supply retailers when the weather was hot. Late summer weather
was cool and led to excess stocks.
As well as trade creditors, Clarke's debts include a Pounds 3m term loan
from NatWest, Pounds 2.5m drawn under an invoice discounting facility,
Pounds 5m of finance leases from Alfa-Laval, from which Clarke had bought
the new equipment, and the Pounds 4.5m loan note from Allied-Lyons.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Costly journey to the market: After yesterday's announcement
of job cuts and pit closures, British Coal faces a fight for survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A keen sense of the role played by coal in two centuries of British
industrial history is needed to appreciate the full impact of yesterday's
developments at British Coal. A fuel which provided the spark for an
industrial revolution which eventually swept the world is to be run down,
possibly shut off for good.
Shock and anger were the predictable reaction to this historic moment. But
there was also bewilderment at the scale, and even ruthlessness, of the
operation, to say nothing of the timing.
Why turn thousands of workers on to the streets in the depths of the worst
recession since the second world war? Why slash output of a leading national
resource at a time when coal imports are already rising sharply? Why try to
transform coal into a commercial proposition when no other country in Europe
has come remotely near achieving this?
The answer to all these questions lies in the government's determination to
end the cossetting which has kept British Coal alive for decades, and force
it to earn its place in the world. Although privatisation is in view, a
successful sale would be seen more as confirmation that British Coal had
secured that place than as a goal in itself.
Few people spoke more bitterly about the closures than the company's own
chairman, Mr Neil Clarke, who said they were 'a scant reward' for the
efforts miners had already put into streamlining the company. And even he
raised questions about the wisdom of UK energy policy.
But the cuts follow successive Tory governments' efforts - halting though
they have been - to remove the distortions from the British energy market.
Once the electricity industry was privatised two years ago and the power
generators were free to buy coal wherever they wished, British Coal's only
hope of survival lay in producing coal at the right price. Contracts with
the generators account for three-quarters of its sales.
The old subsidised contracts expire next March, and this dictated the
politically awkward timing of yesterday's announcements. The new contracts
that will replace them will be freely negotiated. If the government had
wanted to postpone the cuts until the economy was in better shape, it would
have had to extend subsidies even longer - something it was not prepared to
do. Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, said
yesterday: 'We are supporting British Coal to the tune of Pounds 100m a
month. That is equivalent to all the support I give to the rest of British
industry.'
British Coal has been preparing for this moment ever since the bitter and
protracted strike of the mid-1980s broke the back of union resistance.
Already significantly leaner than those tumultuous times, the company has
nearly trebled output per man, and even managed to report a Pounds 170m
profit last year, albeit after the government had written off billions of
pounds of debt. British Coal is the most efficient coal producer in the EC
by a long way.
But although this has involved cumulative pit closures and job losses far
greater than those announced yesterday, the drive to become competitive
continues.
British Coal currently sells coal for about Pounds 1.80 a gigajoule, well
above the world market price of Pounds 1.20gj. The new contracts now being
negotiated with electricity generators would reduce the price to Pounds
1.50gj. But that will not be enough to staunch the flow of imports which now
account for more than a fifth of the 90m tonnes of coal consumed in the UK
each year. Mr Clarke forecast yesterday that British Coal would be fully
competitive with imports by the end of the new five-year contracts.
However, price is not the only pressure bearing down on British Coal. Last
year's report by N M Rothschild, merchant banking advisers to the
government, predicted that UK coal demand would fall to 65m tonnes by
1994/95 and 60m tonnes by the end of the century. Today, those figures might
have to be reduced by a further 10m tonnes because of a decline in the
electricity industry's needs.
The factors shrinking the coal market include the growing popularity of
natural gas as a fuel for power generation. With the North Sea now in full
flood, supplies look plentiful until the middle of the next century. Gas has
the advantage of being clean and easy to transport. By building new gas
power stations, generators can take advantage of the latest technology which
produces much more electricity from a given quantity of fuel.
There are also environmental considerations. The UK has subscribed to a
European Community commitment to reduce carbon emissions to their 1990 level
by 2000. Although new technology has been developed to burn coal more
cleanly, the existing power generation structure with its old and dirty
stations makes expansion of coal inappropriate.
Nor does the traditional case for coal - the security of supply - carry much
weight these days. In spite of its advances, British Coal has yet to shake
off its reputation as a costly and unreliable supplier. And the abundance of
alternative domestic fuels has weakened whatever claim it had as purveyor of
a vital national resource.
But powerful though these arguments look, many people believe they have been
overstated. Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former commercial director of British
Coal who left the company earlier this year over disagreements about the
cuts, says: 'They are not inevitable.' He points to the subsidies which
continue to be handed to the nuclear power industry and to the distorted
prices being paid in the 'dash' for North Sea gas. Coal also has to compete
with electricity imported by cross-Channel cable from France's state-owned
power industry, and with imported coal which British Coal alleges is being
dumped by third-world countries. He believes the coal market could be
sustained at 60m-65m tonnes a year.
However, with the deed now done, the question is whether British Coal will
be able to find a new life or whether the cuts have effectively condemned it
to a lingering death.
The prospects for a European coal business based on deep mines are not
encouraging. Most EC producers have already closed their pits for good. Only
two countries still produce coal in any quantity - Spain and Germany - and
both subsidise it heavily, Spain to the tune of nearly Dollars 1bn a year.
In contrast, countries such as Colombia, Australia and South Africa produce
coal in high volume and at very low prices, mainly because their operations
are open-cast. These are the producers against which British Coal will have
to compete to survive.
Another question mark over British Coal is the impact of the new electricity
contracts. Although these have yet to be concluded, the outline agreement
suggests that the tougher terms will reduce last year's Pounds 170m profit,
though Mr Clarke stressed yesterday that British Coal would remain in the
black. The shift towards gas also makes British Coal 'virtually unsaleable',
according to the Coalfield Communities Campaign which is fighting the
closures.
The challenge facing the government will be to avoid any further cuts as it
tries to entice would-be purchasers. Mr Heseltine is committed to selling
off the 'largest viable' coal industry he can. There are potential buyers
for the whole company, including two separate trade union-led buy-out plans.
But he will also come under pressure to break British Coal into bits to
satisfy the larger number of potential purchasers who are only interested in
particular types of pit, or in operations in particular regions.
The case for trying to keep British Coal intact rests mainly on the need to
have the strongest possible bargaining partner against the duopoly of the
two big generators, National Power and PowerGen. From the buyer's point of
view, the bigger the company, the more widely the buyer can spread the risk
that its mines will run out of coal. Size also brings economies of scale.
On the other hand, a monolithic coal company might repeat the error the
government made in failing to split up British Gas at privatisation, and has
since required corrective action by the Office of Fair Trading. Two
competing coal companies, constructed with a similar mix of businesses,
might be needed to give the necessary competitive stimulus. Rothschild
believes that splitting British Coal into two - though not more - would be
viable.
But forces are arrayed against a split. 'We've already got competition
coming out of our ears,' says Mr Doug Bulmer, the president of the British
Association of Colliery Management which hopes to lead a buy-out. There is a
rival buy-out plan by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in alliance with
East Midlands Electricity.
The government will also have to decide whether British Coal should be sold
as a free-standing group, or absorbed by a larger international
conglomerate. Each course has different attractions. On its own, British
Coal would be in charge of its destiny, but vulnerable. As part of a larger
group, it would have stronger backing, but would be only one part of a
company's global coal strategy. Either way, Mr Tim Eggar the energy
minister, is keen for miners to have a stake in the company, though he may
encourage them to settle for a profit-sharing scheme rather than the riskier
direct share ownership.
Yesterday's announcement and the eventual conclusion of the new electricity
contracts will be the most important events in the run-up to the sale
because they provide the vital information in assessing British Coal's
value.
Estimates of this value range up to Pounds 500m. The main variable is the
extent to which the government takes over British Coal's huge liabilities
for pensions, severance pay, free coal for workers and pit subsidence. It is
expected that the Treasury will have to take on liabilities for British
Coal's past activities, leaving the company to assume its new ones. But this
will still leave the Treasury with a multi-billion pound bill, meaning that
however much it secures from the sale it will end up with a large deficit on
the deal.
British Coal may achieve a new existence, but it will be unrecognisable in
size and character compared with just 10 years ago. The company's fate shows
how closely interlinked the strands of the energy business can be. 'Other
people take these decisions. Coal suffers from the results,' said Mr Clarke.
To which Mr Heseltine's reply was: 'British Coal cannot go on producing coal
which cannot be sold.'

FT  14 OCT 92 / Personal View: Europe at many speeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACQUES ATTALI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
References to a two-speed Europe as a threat are misleading in at least
three respects. First, it is parochial to speak of the Community as Europe,
when the Continent also includes not only the Efta countries of Scandinavia,
Switzerland and Austria, with which the EC has negotiated an Economic Area
Agreement, but also the countries of central and eastern Europe. The
Community has signed association agreements with some of them.
Second, the idea that a diversity of arrangements within the Community would
be novel is also false. Quite apart from the Schengen agreement - still to
be implemented - on removing all border controls between eight of the 12
members, there were, even before recent events, no fewer than five monetary
relationships among the 12.
The prospect of a multi-speed Europe has been stirred by uncertainty about
the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. However, Britain's failure to
endorse the social chapter and its option on European monetary union, as
well as the implications of incomplete fulfilment of the convergence
conditions for monetary union, mean that the treaty itself envisages complex
geometry and dynamics.
Indeed, this kind of explicit conditionality might be an appropriate way of
meeting the aspirations of the countries of central and eastern Europe.
Without ratification of Maastricht, however, these aspirations will turn to
frustration, adding to current tensions and the risks of instability in
Europe as a whole. Even with ratification, the risks may remain unless the
EC takes a more enlightened longer-term view of the economic interests of
eastern and central Europe.
Finally, the language of fast and slow lanes is very misleading. While some
European countries have made rapid economic progress in the past, it is
those currently lagging which are likely to move faster on average over the
period to ultimate convergence and completion of European unity, in whatever
form it may take.
But it is right to be concerned about the form. Some form or common space is
necessary as a counter-weight against the current trends towards tribalism,
which at their most terrifying turn into the horrors of ethnic cleansing.
The challenge is how to achieve that common space while preserving cultural
diversity. How should relations between all the countries of the Continent
develop, particularly in their relations with the Community?
In fact, of course there are already three communities, not one (the EC,
European Coal and Steel Community, European Atomic Energy Authority), and
one can readily imagine the proliferation of different groupings if the 12
agree a monetary union (of about six members), free movement (the Schengen
agreement of eight) and a Social Community (of 11). In this situation, new
entrants to the European family of communities would face a choice as to
which groupings to apply to; they might find it easier or more desirable to
achieve entry to some than others.
For example, Iceland might choose to stay in the European Economic Area
rather than accept the 'communitisation' of the fisheries in its territorial
waters. Central European countries might find this limited status easier to
achieve than full membership of the pre-Maastricht arrangements, with their
implications for possible migration and the cost, to existing members, of
intra-community income equalisation. This form of step-by-step integration
is likely to prove more acceptable than an all-or-nothing decision to both
the prospective entrant and existing members.
Moreover, it may be appropriate for some eastern European countries to
maintain relatively high tariffs to protect their industries while enjoying
favoured access, under the Gatt generalised system of preferences, to the
markets of those farther down the road to transition. Nor can one exclude
the possibility of a country such as the Czech Republic (or even Estonia)
joining the monetary hard core of Europe, even before some of the EC member
states are ready to do so.
European countries have always moved at different speeds. For the past 40
years this process in the western half of the continent has been within the
framework of the shifting structures of the EC and Efta. It is crucial for
this process to continue and to expand, allowing the countries of eastern
and central Europe to move at different speeds within a common space - what
I call a Continental Common Market - at this time of profound change.
As the nature of these relationships deepens, irrespective of the healthy
assertion of the doctrine of subsidiarity (I prefer the notion of 'cultural
diversity'), the range of possible relationships is enriched. Europe a la
carte would offer the diner an embarras de richesse. Over the next 40 years
or more, the mutual nature of such decisions may reduce the real choices,
but not the richness of the resulting configuration.

Development.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Coal takes the unkindest cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKHAM MAIN, Bevercotes, Cotgrave, Frickley, Grimethorpe, Houghton Main.
The names echo across a century of Britain's industrial history and culture,
recalling a conflict here, a brass band there, a disaster elsewhere.
These six, along with 25 others, are pits which will cease to produce coal
as a result of the cuts announced yesterday by British Coal. Coming at the
nadir of recession, the loss of 30,000 more jobs, is a grave matter. It is
proper to ask who is to blame for this state of affairs and whether any
other course is available.
The accusing finger points most obviously at the National Union of
Mineworkers and its leader, Mr Arthur Scargill. It was he who proclaimed a
mission to defend the coal industry but whose reckless and misguided actions
ensured that miners became a symbol of political extremism and their
industry a byword for instability and unreliability. The Thatcher government
vowed to destroy Mr Scargill's power and had the backing of most British
people when it succeeded in doing so during the 1984-85 miners' strike.
Scargill factor
Since the strike, Mr Scargill has continued his menaces, but ever more
hollowly as the industry has crumbled around him. But his ghost has served
as a pungent reminder that coal had thrown away its biggest asset, that it
is indigenous, plentiful and above all secure. Since British coal has
powerful natural disadvantages - it pollutes the air more than gas, oil and
nuclear and is 50 per cent more costly than imported coal - this put British
Coal in a very vulnerable position.
The result has been that as soon as coal's customers in the electric power
industry achieved, through privatisation, the freedom to diversify away from
coal, they have done so, even in some cases contracting for gas-fired power
stations whose economics is questionable.
The two big generators, National Power and Powergen, are bargaining British
Coal into the ground over a five-year contract to apply from next April.
Yesterday, British Coal admitted that it can persuade the generators to take
no more than 40m tonnes of coal in the first year of the new contract,
compared with 65m tonnes this year.
By the time the details of this contract are complete, the government plans
to have submitted to parliament a bill to privatise what remains of the coal
industry.
In one way, then, the coal story can be viewed as a triumph of market
economics, albeit one with very painful consequences. The government says
electricity bills will be 3 per cent lower than would otherwise have been
the case, with obvious benefits for industrial competitiveness.
Market forces
The story is not, however, quite that simple, since the private sector
utilities to which British Coal either offers competition or supplies are
themselves imperfectly exposed to market forces. In supporting the reference
of British Gas to the Monopolies Commission this year, the government has at
last recognised that its privatisation as a single entity was a serious
mistake. It has yet to be quite so candid about electricity, where the
inadequately regulated duopoly of National Power and Powergen is a candidate
for draconian scrutiny by the competition authorities. Then there is the
nuclear power industry, still in state hands, heavily subsidised and due for
official review in 1994. This industry is already pressing its case for
investment in additional power stations, further threatening the coal
industry.
There is no case for paying British Coal to produce fuel no one wishes to
buy, and none for denying to the British economy the benefits of low world
energy prices. That other EC countries do subsidise their much more
inefficient industries cannot alter this judgment. But as they line up for
their redundancy pay, Britain's coal miners will be right to reflect that
the harsh wind of market forces has not blown uniformly across British
energy policy.
It is not possible to judge whether the Pounds 1bn the government said
yesterday it would make available to help regenerate the economies of
shattered mining communities is an adequate sum. As victims of the energy
policy errors of the 1980s as well as of their own misjudgments, the miners
deserve generosity.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Capitalism, Chinese style
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK in Beijing, the contradictions inherent in China's experiment with
'market socialism' are on display in all their peculiarity. At the 14th
national Communist party congress, the doddering men and women who rule
1.2bn Chinese are gathered to write another chapter in the country's
conversion to capitalism. The watchwords are free markets without free
politics; a vibrant private sector alongside a dominant public sector; a
further opening to the west, but a vigorous fight against pollution by
western ideas.
It is tempting to conclude that this represents an unstable mix - that the
system, like communism in the former Soviet Union, is moving inexorably
towards collapse under the weight of such contradictions. Yet that is not
how things have turned out to date. On the contrary, China's partial
liberation of market forces has produced one of the most extraordinary
phenomena of the late 20th century: an economy that has more than doubled in
size since liberalisation began in 1978 and could double again by the year
2000. China would then be well on the way to becoming the world's newest
superpower.
Whether it can manage such a transformation without domestic upheaval or
international conflict will depend in part on decisions rubber-stamped in
Beijing in the next few days. This congress will almost certainly be the
last in the lifetime of Deng Xiaoping, the 88-year-old architect of reform.
Will the cause outlive him? Or will economic change spawn social unrest and
a clash over demands for political reform?
Private enterprise
Three years ago, after the violent suppression of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen square, many observers gave pessimistic answers.
The crackdown, they said, demonstrated that the party could not cling to
power without reversing, or at least shelving, its market reforms. Recent
events suggest party bosses have drawn different conclusions: that private
enterprise holds the key to China's modernisation, and that - as in several
other recent Asian success stories - it can be harnessed without a
significant dilution of authoritarian rule. The people seem to approve.
Indeed, the evidence suggests that economic liberalisation would now be
difficult for the gerontocrats to reverse.
How long these nostrums will hold true is open to doubt. Behind this week's
sloganising lies an uneasy awareness of some difficult policy dilemmas. Most
immediately, the economy is showing signs of overheating. Given that the
authorities now seem powerless to fine-tune the economy, they may find
themselves forced into a crude clampdown on inflationary pressures like that
which helped fuel political unrest in the late 1980s. Discontent could be
fuelled by the enormous economic imbalances between the regions resulting
from the southern provinces' dash for growth, or by rampant official
corruption.
Tricky questions
The dismal performance of state industry also raises tricky questions
concerning the party's role: the streamlining of state-owned enterprises
under the discipline of thoroughgoing price reform could throw millions out
of work in a country which has hitherto guaranteed lifetime employment.
Above all, the drive for the market will inevitably mean a progressive loss
of power by the party. State industry already accounts for not much more
than half of total Chinese output, and the proportion is certain to fall
further. It is far from clear that the party or military elders are all
reconciled to such a diminution of their role. Much will depend on the next,
somewhat less elderly, generation of reformers, some of whom are expected to
be promoted to the party's inner circle at the end of the current congress.
For western countries, China's rapid development inevitably spells ever
closer involvement in its economic affairs. It also means that they have a
growing stake in ensuring that it accompanies economic liberalisation with
sensible political reform, including an improved record on human rights.
They will need to recognise that the best means of fostering broad-based
change lies in encouraging China's private entrepreneurs through trade and
investment, not in using trade sanctions on political grounds.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Arts: 'The Kingdom' and a trio with promise - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Columbus dominated radio and television at the weekend, the BBC
also found time for a small festival that set sail in quite another
direction. In Birmingham the BBC orchestras came together over four days to
present a series of concerts featuring the music of Elgar.
Most of what they played was the best-known Elgar, the exception being The
Kingdom. The oratorio had its premiere in Birmingham in 1906 and it sounded
resplendent in the Radio 3 broadcast on Saturday from the city's Symphony
Hall and the BBC forces came to London's Royal Festival Hall to give a
repeat performance on Monday.
Of Elgar's three major oratorios, The Kingdom was the last. Its maturity
shows: the choral writing is surer, there is greater expertise in the
handling of large-scale movements. While the music does not confront the
great issues of life and death or good and evil, like The Dream of Gerontius
and The Apostles, the work does exhibit the virtue of a more consistent
standard.
Its strengths, of pacing and architecture, were well realised by Andrew
Davis. We cannot now hear what Elgar himself, the young Boult and Barbirolli
would have made of the music, although we can guess at their spontaneity and
generous emotion. Davis is cooler at heart; his performance had a simple
dignity.
As is coming to look typical of Davis's time at the BBC Symphony Orchestra,
the music was scrupulously prepared. The detail in the orchestral part was
clear and articulate. The choral singing from the BBC Singers, the BBC
Symphony Chorus and (in Birmingham only) the Worcester Festival Chorus was a
good deal above what one usually encounters in this work.
In Birmingham the beautifully delicate soprano soloist was Joan Rodgers; in
London her place was taken by the more fully lyric soprano of Pamela Coburn.
David Wilson-Johnson aimed to inject the right visionary fervour into the
bass Peter's scenes, with Christine Cairns and Laurence Dale giving support
as mezzo and tenor. Ideally, however, the music demands four solo singers
with either more power or presence, or both.
                           *      *      *
There was a packed Queen Elizabeth Hall for the Sunday afternoon recital by
the trio of Joshua Bell (violin), Steven Isserlis (cello) and Olli Mustonen
(piano) - with a pleasing number of parents and children in the audience.
Chamber music of this sort, given by three exceptionally talented young
instrumentalists who are also engagingly fresh platform figures (each in his
own version of the schoolboy-scruff shirt and tie), presents an unstuffy,
welcoming impression - which is all to the good.
Whether, on the other hand, these performances of Schumann's Phantasiestucke
and D minor Trio and the great Schubert E flat Trio can be counted genuine
chamber music at all is a curmudgeonly question which haunted the concert
like Carabosse at Aurora's christening. Three such distinct musical
presences - the admirably straightforward Bell, the rapturous Isserlis, the
mercurial Mustonen - could indeed be forged into an inspired ensemble, with
repeated experience and regular applications of effort; but on this
evidence, the process simply has not begun to happen.
What we heard in all three works were three strongly individual approaches
to the music, amicably and often vigorously confronted. The 'conversational'
arts of the medium - the immediate responsiveness of one player to the
nuances of another, the sense of deep and long-range command of the
movements - remained out of reach.
In both Schumann works there was a great deal of 'feeling' on show with
lingering in soft passages and frenzy in loud. More variety of expressive
approach marked the Schubert, and individual contributions were often
beautifully eloquent. Altogether, though, the concert was an indication of
chamber-musical promise, not fulfilment.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Arts: Three Shouts from a Hill - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the 1930s, Sean O'Casey wrote three one-act farces, or as Shakespeare
said, 'tedious-brief' scenes of 'tragical mirth'. The three have been
gathered by the O'Casey Theater Company, and are touring as Three Shouts
from a Hill. The Lilian Baylis Theatre offers a plain setting for the
traditional, realistic sets which O'Casey favoured. The acting is lively and
precise and Shivaun O'Casey's direction well paced. But it takes a singular
view of laughter to smile at any of this. Nor is it the fault of play or
players, merely the genre.
The idea of farce here is Henri Bergson's: that the comic in life emanated
from human lack of control over self or surroundings. Thus the banana skin,
and thus Samuel Beckett's best Irish banana joke in Krapp's Last Tape. When
Beckett saw these plays, he applauded 'the triumph of the principle of
knockabout'.
The first, The End of the Beginning is piece of light rural hilarity about
Darry and his wife Lizzie. They reverse roles. She mows the meadow while he
tackles the domestic chores. Darry sets to, but his brother appears,
distracts him, and things get out of control. Crockery smashes, lights fuse,
oil leaks, and a heifer is tethered to a precarious slope by means of a rope
down the chimney and lashed to a chair. This farce knows how to waste time
and shows other people wasting it, frittering away their lives by the
minute.
Much better is the second piece, A Pound on Demand, a short sketch set in a
Pimlico Post Office. This amounts to a one-line joke teased into a
thirty-minute scene of excruciating delay. Two Irishmen, one drunk, lurch
into this Post Office and ask for 'A Pound on demand' from their savings
account. But the drawer is too drunk to sign his own name, and spends the
entire scene trying to write. O'Casey's sense that drunks hold bystanders
universally responsible for institutional rules is sharp and accurate. The
Post Office staff, customers, and an inevitable policeman compound the
situation.
Bedtime Story lies pillowed in the arms of Catholic guilt about sex. The
boarding-house or bachelor flat is familiar O'Casey territory. Johnjo
Mulligan, a clerk, meets Angela Nightingale, a gay lass; Daniel Halibut,
clerk and friend to Johnjo, and Miss Mossie, the lodging house keeper, look
on. A policeman and nurse wait in the wings.
The plot moves forward predictably. After their bedroom assignation, Angela
works on Johnjo's sexual guilt, claims she has lost her handbag, and waltzes
off into the night with his money, coat and umbrella. The distraught Johnjo
pursues, but Halibut and Mossie think he's sleepwalking, and summon the
authorities. This is never more than mildly amusing, nor meant to be, but
does cast up some funny lines: 'This isn't disarray, Mr Halibut, it's an
upheaval.'
Lilian Baylis Theatre until October 17; then Glasgow, Belfast, New York and
Philadelphia.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Arts: In search of the individual voice - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here we are at the start of television's autumn season when the clocks go
back, the weather turns colder and the broadcasters bring out their choicest
wares. The viewers are back from holiday, the evenings are too dark for
gardening, and ratings consequently shoot up. That, anyway, is what we have
always been told, and in the past there has been much truth in it. But for
those of us returning to Britain at the start of the 1992 autumn season
matters look rather different.
Perhaps this year the broadcasters' sights have been moved. Maybe they are
so preoccupied with the revolution in commercial broadcasting due to begin
in January 1993 that they can scarcely bring themselves to concentrate on
the here and now. There are, of course, new series but these days, with four
terrestrial channels running day and night, there is nothing unusual about
that. The most striking aspect of so many of the series that have started in
the past few days is not that they seem so different or fresh, but that they
seem so terribly familiar.
Viewers who were relieved when the lacklustre Wogan show was finally removed
from the early evening may be baffled and even appalled to find Terry
Wogan's Friday Night now turning up at 10.25. Ah, but had we not noticed the
dramatic differences? The only noticeable differences last Friday were that
instead of sitting in armchairs and being sycophantically polite while
hyping their latest disc or movie, the 'guests' sat at a table and Edwina
Currie shouted at Max Clifford. We consequently learned nothing about
Clifford (said to be responsible for such tabloid scoops as Mellor and the
actress and 'Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster') but this incident will probably
be seen by the producers as 'good television'.
The most striking concentration of derivative material occurs on Saturday
evening. The new autumn schedule includes Gladiators on ITV, a British copy
of the series described here last autumn as 'a po-faced American version of
It's A Knockout'. BBC2 offers The Brain Drain with a billing that declares
'Jimmy Mulville and a panel of comedians continue the eternal search for
answers to questions such as 'Is there a god?' and 'Why am I here?'' They
are there because the biggest comedy success of the last year or so has been
Have I Got News For You, and everyone is now determinedly copying it, not
least Hat Trick Productions, the independent company responsible for both
these series.
Most derivative of all is Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch on ITV. Barry
Humphries' astounding dame presides over a 'game' in which a hapless woman
has to watch a video of her own house being examined - bread kept under the
sink, extensive scuff marks on the walls behind the bedposts, and so on -
and listen to Edna's commentary: 'You adorable and slightly grubby woman, I
mean that in a nurturing way . . .' There are reminders here of several
other 'embarrassment' series including Beadle's About, Through The Keyhole
and Surprise Surprise but, as with Edison's light bulb, though the idea may
not be original this looks like the perfect development of the genre for
those who like such stuff.
As ever it would be unfair to imply that there has been nothing worth
watching. Tony Parsons' polemic 'The Tattooed Jungle', directed against the
pot-bellied Nike-shod lager louts of today's working classes, in Channel 4's
Without Walls, was one of the most vivid and vitriolic expressions of
personal opinion ever screened. It was all the more powerful for being
directed, in Parsons' own impeccably working class accents, against one of
the most untouchable of the medium's sacred cows. No doubt Parsons is wrong
in believing that most British workers ever were the paragons of grace,
decency and wit that his rose tinted spectacles suggest, and no doubt today
there are numerous exceptions to the mindless yobs he deplores. But after
all the years of fond idealisation of the working classes on television,
especially in drama, this was a long overdue backlash.
With all the cynicism about the American presidential election and the way
in which the mass media supposedly cheapen the electoral process, it was
also peculiarly heartening to watch, on BBC2 late on Sunday night, the first
three-way debate between Bush, Clinton and Perot. Maybe it was not the most
profound political discussion ever televised, but at least the American
candidates, unlike their British counterparts, do face each other on
television, do address the issues, do talk about broad political principles,
and are held strictly to time limits.
Nobody would pretend, however, that this was one of the big events of
Britain's television week. What were they? If you judge by attention given
in the other mass media they must have included the appearance of a Jesus
Christ puppet on Spitting Image and the first showing of the new Madonna
video, Erotica by Channel 4. Given that Spitting Image has regularly
featured a puppet of God in the past it seems odd to get excited now about a
puppet of his son, and anyway the sketch in question was anodyne when
compared to - say - Salman Rushdie's material concerning equally sacred
figures in The Satanic Verses.
As for the Madonna video, first of all the woman deserves three cheers for
the open enjoyment that she brings to matters sexual. The contrast between
her relish and the obscurantism and hypocrisy which usually surround the
subject on television, and elsewhere, is striking. Feminism clearly has its
uses since no man would be allowed to perform material as explicit as this.
That said, this video, like her previous one, would be more attractive if it
were less brutal and more subtle. Moreover it is surely time to break away
from the machine-gun editing which seems to have become mandatory in the
video world; viewers will not fall asleep if a shot is held for more than
two seconds.
Most important of all, it seems clear that, however slick the marketing,
Madonna's songs and videos are powerful expressions of her own
individuality, an increasingly unusual phenomenon in the modern world of pop
with its corporate packaging machinery. And not only in pop. It is the
individual voice which seems so rare, whatever category of programmes you
choose, in this autumn season. True, there are whole swathes of material -
drama and documentary for example - not touched on in this column, and we
shall be coming back to them. Yet here too there seems precious little so
far of striking individual merit.
The irony is that even as television becomes more and more formulaic so more
and more attention is lavished upon it. The process by which the mass media
feed upon themselves is a little like 'howl round', that awful technical
phenomenon in which a microphone picks up some of its own amplified noise
and feeds it back into the system to produce an intensifying screech which
goes round and round and reaches a crescendo which is unbearable to the
ears. With this now occurring so often the danger is that the only
individual voices remaining audible will be those that are backed and
amplified by Madonna-style promotion machines, a process which is itself
nearly always destructive in the end. Will the quieter individual voice be
noticeable at all in the television of the nineties? We shall see.

The 'public access' programme on BBC2, now called Open Space, looks more
professsional today than when it first started. Back in the early idealistic
days the idea was to hand over technology and assistance to members of the
public so they could really make their own programmes. The trouble is that
if you genuinely allow people full control you risk getting unwatchable
material. Today it is often difficult to see the difference between these
programmes and those in other current affairs slots.
Another series begins tonight with the story of Mordechai Vanunu, who was
kidnapped by Mossad and tried in Israel after his claims about Israel's
nuclear weapons programme (7.40).
Anyone who watched the opening episode of BBC2's bizarre drama serial
Downtown Lagos will surely want to see Part 2 (9.25): is it a legal yarn? A
story of wild colonial days? A drugs thriller? Who knows, yet it has style
and a powerful grip.
Channel 4 has two big attractions: the first episode in the final series of
the consistently funny Golden Girls (10.00) and another episode from the
crazy drama serial The Prisoner (11.15).

FT  14 OCT 92 / Arts: Germany at last discovers Martinu / Review of
'Julietta' and 'The Greek Passion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At long last, German opera houses are discovering Martinu. Bielefeld opened
the new season with Julietta. Mainz chose The Greek Passion, a timely
parable of Germany's refugee dilemma. Next month Mannheim will stage Comedy
on the Bridge.
Germany may have come a long way from the cultural chauvinism of the
interwar years, but there is still a strong element of condescension towards
Czech music - one reason why Martinu's operas have until now been almost
completely ignored. Unlike Janacek, who is steadily winning acceptance as a
repertory composer, Martinu had no Max Brod to translate and promote his
stage works. Nor does his music conform to the German idea of structure or
thematic development.
Martinu's attractions lie elsewhere - as the Bielefeld and Mainz productions
have underlined. Although separated by more than 20 years in date of
composition, Julietta and The Greek Passion are very much from the same
stable. Both are complex in harmony and texture, with idiosyncratic solos
for accordion and piano. Both demonstrate Martinu's willingness to declare
his debts without compromising his own distinctive musical personality - as
in the opening Daphnis-like mirage and Czech pastoral moods of Julietta, or
the explosive treatment of Orthodox chorale in The Greek Passion.
The similarities extend to subject-matter: both operas reflect Martinu's
life-long preoccupation with the relationship between reality and fiction.
In Julietta, based on Georges Neveux's surrealist play, the central
character Michel returns to a French coastal village in search of a girl
whose voice captivated him years before. He finds himself in a world where
no-one has a memory, sees his own grasp of reality growing less sure and
ends up seeking comfort from the Kafka-esque Central Office of Dreams. In
The Greek Passion, which Martinu sculpted from a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis,
villagers confronted by a group of refugees act out in real life the
biblical parts they have been allotted for their Passion Play. Hearing the
two operas within a few days of each other (and with the Lyon production of
Three Wishes still fresh in the memory), one notices how all Martinu's main
characters become captives of their roles.
The Bielefeld Julietta was designed and directed by John Dew, who is at his
best in his home theatre. The action took place on a V-shaped,
crayon-coloured set, which went through a 360-degree turn in the course of
the evening - an apt metaphor for the plot's mysterious deja vu circle. The
characters wore stylised 1930s costumes, but the modern travel-agent
associations of the Central Office of Dreams were suggested by a soul-less
computer-desk. There was some humour - particularly from Ion Bric and
Michael Vier as the Old Man and Woman - but the stage performance was more
worthy than inspired.
Richard Decker's tall young Michel seemed to be feeling his way into the
role, an arduous one which keeps him on stage virtually the whole evening.
As the elusive Julietta, whose brief contributions provide the opera's most
memorable music, Claudia Taha sang better than she looked - appropriately so
for a character who can be heard more often than seen. The production's
chief asset was the orchestral playing under Geoffrey Moull. Dynamics,
rhythm and texture were expertly judged, pointing up the many deft touches
in Martinu's restless, underwhelming score.
The Greek Passion at the Mainz State Theatre was both a revelation and an
event of heartwarming consolation - that rare occurrence when one's own
stubborn belief in a work is totally and utterly vindicated by a performance
beyond one's dreams. Here was not the awkward stage oratorio of repute, nor
the episodic quality which characterises Julietta. Instead, The Greek
Passion emerged as a fully-fledged music drama, a concise and moving
masterwork in which Martinu crowns his search for the humanity in man.
Much of the credit goes to the excellent Mainz orchestra (well-remembered
from last season's Gloriana) and its conductor, Peter Erckens, who made the
most of Martinu's biting, richly-contrasted colours and exultant chorus
music. The opera benefited from being played without a break. Heidrun
Schmelzer's set amounted to little more than an open space shaped like a
Crucifix, one of several subtle references to the work's Christian
symbolism. Peter Brenner's staging grew out of the music and made sense of
it, with dignified central performances and well-grouped, disturbingly
familiar refugee scenes.
Robert Ciesla was a Manolios of almost saintly conviction. Elaine Woods
captured the moral frailty and virtue in Katerina, the opera's Mary
Magdalene-figure. As the two priests, Friedemann Kunder (Grigoris) and Hannu
Niemela (Fotis) offered rounded personalities. The smaller parts were all
convincingly sung. If ever there was a landmark production capable of
revealing an opera's true merit, this was it.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: A big loss of energy - Bronwen
Maddox explains why Britain's carbon dioxide emissions are lower than
previously forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recession and the decline of the British coal industry are some of
the most effective ways of combating global warming. Those are two of the
messages tucked away in the UK government's latest models of how much carbon
dioxide the country will pour into the atmosphere in the next three decades.
According to Energy Paper 59*, published last week, the UK will emit around
10 per cent less carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases, than was
feared two years earlier in Energy Paper 58. On its most cautious
projections, the UK is on course to bring carbon dioxide emissions back to
1990 levels by the year 2000, in line with international targets.
That alone is not news: projections showing that future emissions could be
much lower than was once feared began to trickle out last December. But the
new report spells out for the first time the reasons for the new, lower
numbers.
It also sheds light on the future of the UK energy industry, casts doubt on
some of the government's favourite environmental boasts and shows that
transport is one of the toughest remaining environmental obstacles.
Most greenhouse gas emissions come from the use of energy. The model takes
the two factors which have the biggest impact on the UK's demand for energy
 -fossil fuel prices and GDP growth - and plots different combinations of
them, adding in non-energy sources of greenhouse gases at the end. The
calculations reveal several main reasons for the new, lower forecasts.
Recession. Although the central scenario is the same in both models - annual
GDP growth of 2.25 per cent - the high growth path now assumes 2.75 per
cent, not 3.25.
Changes in the structure of the economy. The decline of the energy sector
from 9 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 4 per cent in 2020, and the decline of
energy-intensive parts of manufacturing such as bulk chemicals. Service
industries, which use relatively little energy, are expected to rise from 50
per cent of GDP in 1990 to 54 per cent in 2020.
Changes in methods of electricity generation. In 1990, coal-fired power
stations produced 68 per cent of the UK's electricity and nuclear 21 per
cent. Since then some have been closed, and other closures announced.
By 2020 the new model suggests that coal's share of electricity generation
will have fallen to 27 per cent and nuclear to 2 per cent, on the assumption
that no new nuclear stations are built after Sizewell B. Gas, which produces
lower carbon emissions, may then have a 57 per cent share.
The radical revision of the numbers, within two years, is a lesson about the
crudeness of some of the models which are the basis for wide-ranging and
costly international directives.
It also raises a few sceptical questions about the government's proud
adoption last summer of the year 2000 as the target for stabilising carbon
dioxide emissions at the 1990 level of 160m tonnes, rather than its previous
target of 2005.
Energy Paper 59 suggests that economic slowdown and structural changes have
made the target of the year 2000 much more accessible than was previously
thought. On the other hand forecasts of emissions in 2005 - between 166m and
201m tonnes of carbon - still look disturbingly high.
It is those longer-term projections which still give cause for worry.
Falling energy prices, which push up demand for energy, are a principal
concern, as the report acknowledges. One of the messages of the recent World
Energy Congress in Madrid was that prices are unlikely to rise as shortages
are not imminent.
Carbon taxes have been proposed internationally as a solution. However, the
report makes clear that this may not solve the problems of transport and
households - together they produce 47 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions
and their demand for energy is the least responsive to a hike in prices. The
model shows transport overtaking industry as the largest single polluter by
2000.
This weekend the Department of the Environment (DoE) launches a three-year
Pounds 10m campaign to encourage households to lag water tanks and turn off
lights.
Transport will be tougher - the DoE has already made clear that
controversial initiatives such as road pricing must wait for studies from
the Department of Transport, which are unlikely to be completed for another
year.
*Energy-related carbon emissions in possible future scenarios for the United
Kingdom, Department of Trade and Industry, HMSO Pounds 9.95.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Eco-tourism gets a collective
voice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There may not yet be a television promotion inviting holiday-makers to 'Come
on down' to the Brazilian rain forest or the Rwandan gorilla park, but one
may not be far off. The travel and tourism industry is reaping the benefits
of environmental awareness, aided and abetted by the World Travel and
Tourism Council (WTTC).
The Brussels-based organisation, formed by 50 of the world's chief executive
officers to influence government decision-making at the highest levels, is
now formulating a 'coherent compelling environment message'.
It also has a messenger: Geoffrey Lipman, the council president, who was
plucked from an aviation consultancy firm to promote the industry. Last
week, speaking in Washington, he said eco-tourism is emerging as a rapidly
growing segment of the travel and tourism industry, which in itself is one
of the fastest-growing industries in the world. This year it is expected to
generate more than Dollars 3,000bn (Pounds 1,600bn) worldwide in gross
output or sales. Eco-tourism is attractive for the young, who are
particularly worried about inheriting a despoiled Earth; the growing number
of environmentally-conscious travellers; and also for vacationers bored with
beaches and resorts.
In the US alone, the market potential for eco-tourism is considerable.
According to Donald Hawkins, a professor at George Washington University,
the most popular special interest tours are related to nature-oriented
outdoor activities. Between 4m-6m Americans travel overseas each year for
nature-related trips. About 30m Americans in the US belong to environmental
organisations and 80m Americans call themselves bird watchers.
The travel and tourist industry itself is striving for environmentally
compatible growth, Lipman said. Hotels are adopting sound energy management,
car hire companies are switching to lead-free petrol and airlines are buying
more fuel-efficient aircraft.
The WTTC has established a new World Travel &amp; Tourism Environmental Research
Centre in Oxford to establish a database of environmental policies and
programmes, and to become 'a catalyst for responsible policies'.
Lipman also promotes 'rural tourism' in the EC as a substitute for
inefficient agriculture. He is annoyed that the Community has allocated less
than Dollars 10m a year to promote the concept.
'I'm not just thinking of bed and breakfast on farms, although that is no
bad starting point,' he said. 'I'm thinking of theme holidays, nature
trails, health holidays, rambling trips and so on.' But first the farmers
must be convinced of the economic future in 'nature tourism' because it will
require infrastructure, investment, education and promotion.
Lipman is also pushing eco-tourism where it has a 'competitive advantage in
scenery or wildlife'. It could become 'a major source of income and
potential for economic development' in third world countries with nothing
much else to sell beyond increased exploitation of their natural resources.
He envisions the creation of a Pan African fund to market the continent as a
whole and allow individual countries 'to piggyback' their own programmes.
Lipman is something of an idealist - he left a good job as chief of staff
for the International Air Transport Association to set up an organisation to
represent passengers. But he admits, he has not yet changed his own
environmental habits. 'I'm Mr Average,' he said. 'I think recycling is the
right thing. I sometimes do it. I don't do it enough. If I'm to be a better
person I should do it more.'

FT  14 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Confusion still clouds dioxin
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dioxins might be the world's most toxic poisons, but scientists are still
unsure of precisely how dangerous they are to humans. The poisons  - a large
family of related substances - are produced in minute quantities as a
by-product of industrial activity in which chlorine is involved. Typical
sources are wood-pulp processing, herbicide manufacture and waste
incineration.
Dioxins are emitted with other waste products and ingested by animals and
absorbed by plants. Humans take in dioxins when they eat meat, fish and milk
products. Early research showed that dioxins could cause cancer. Now some
scientists suspect that the poisons can have a detrimental effect on the
immune system and can retard physical and mental development in children.
The lack of knowledge has direct effects on some businesses. European
incinerator operators, for example, will soon have to make big - and they
say expensive - reductions in their permitted dioxin emissions.
Dioxins first came to public attention when they were found to be a
contaminant in a defoliant called Agent Orange, used by the US during the
Vietnam war. Some people who came into contact with the defoliant developed
a skin condition called chlorachne, but there was no conclusive evidence
that dioxins killed people.
Nevertheless, scientific concern about the poison led to the evacuation of
an entire community in Times Beach, Missouri after dioxins were found in a
chemical waste dump nearby.
More recently the Dutch authorities banned the sale of milk from cows that
were grazing near a waste incinerator. And this year the UK government
stopped the sale of milk from two farms in Derbyshire when high levels of
dioxins were discovered in animals, milk and plants near an industrial
plant.
The World Health Authority in 1990 revised the safe levels for human
consumption upwards to 0.01 nanograms per kilogram body weight per day. The
level was increased after a panel of leading scientists decided that dioxins
provided less of a threat to human health than at first thought. Last year a
US report described the danger from dioxins as no more harmful that a week
of sunbathing.
But the US government is now in the process of revising the official view
and it looks likely that dioxins soon will be back on the extreme danger
list. The chlorine industry has been lobbying hard on both sides of the
Atlantic to prevent stricter regulations.
A review of global research into dioxins - by the industry-funded European
Chemical Industry Ecology and Toxicology Centre - is due to be published
this month. According to Peter Jones, a scientist who worked on the report:
'I think the dioxin issue has been overblown but I am not saying that it is
unimportant. Some concern is certainly due, but not paranoia,' he says.
But environmental campaigners are concerned about the increase in the number
of incinerators and the continuing use of processes and chemicals that
create dioxins.
'There are some powerful vested interests that are trying to cloud the
issue,' says Rebecca Rees of the Women's Environmental Network. 'The most
recent findings indicate that there is no tolerable level of dioxins for
humans, even one molecule can trigger an effect in the body. In the long
term we are looking for a phase-out of the chlorine industry,' she says.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Jobs: How universities fared - St Andrews pips Durham to top
employment league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN free to choose, the Jobs column likes to give readers at least a
fortnight to recover between doses of data about graduates. But alas, as the
official number-crunchers brook no delay, last week's dollop of same is
being followed today by another - as witness the table to the right which is
this year apt to be particularly controversial.
Before telling why, though, I'd better explain how the table goes about its
task of ranking United Kingdom higher educational institutions by the
jobs-market performance of their graduates.
As was the case a week ago, the graduates in question are those who gained
first degrees, as opposed to the higher kind such as doctorates, in the
summer of 1991 which is the latest year for which statistics are available.
Since then, as is all too well known, the jobs market has gone from bad to
evil.
One difference from last week is that we are concerned solely with British
graduates, in the sense of being deemed domiciled in the UK as distinct from
coming to study from other countries. Another difference is that the table
refers only to largely state-funded universities which held that status in
1991. Former polytechnics newly translated into universities are left out of
account, as are other types of higher educational institutions including the
Open University.
The first column of figures gives the total number of new UK graduates such
universities produced in the summer of last year. The second shows the
percentages of same who had vanished from their Alma Mater's purview by
December 31, six months after taking their degree.
The next section of the table, consisting of five columns, looks at the 1991
graduates whose whereabouts were known. After the numbers thereof, we have
four sets of percentages.
The first denotes those who obtained a job with longer-term prospects, and
the second those continuing in full-time study or training. Both those sets
might be said to have found regular occupations for their highly educated
talents. But the other two groups are different.
One is the people who declared themselves not available for employment at
all, as distinct from those who returned to some organisation which had kept
them on its books while they studied. The next lumps together those
unemployed at the year-end, and those in a temporary job lasting at most
three months.
So much for the graduates of the single year 1991.
It is the table's final section that raises the controversy. For it provides
the basis of the ranking of the universities by job-market performance,
which is as fair as the statistics available permit.
The criterion is the number of graduates in the category that lumps together
the unemployed and those in temporary jobs only. But instead of taking a
single year's performance which may be skewed by odd events, the last
section takes the graduate outputs of the three years 1989-91.
Moreover it compensates for variances in the mix of subjects taught from one
campus to another. Otherwise, since engineers are normally more in demand
than historians and such, universities strong in engineering would have an
unfair start over those more concentrated on the arts.
So the last section begins by giving each campus a 'target' representing the
number of its graduates who would have been in the unemployed-and-temporary
category if they'd conformed to the all-universities average for their
respective subjects.
Then comes the number who actually ended in that category. And the final
column shows the percentage by which each place either bettered its target
or fell short, which decides its rank.
What ushers in controversy is that judgments on such matters vary. In
particular, on Monday the Times newspaper (no relation of the FT) printed a
league table of universities which was more ambitious than my effort, being
based on a range of criteria. But one of them was employment, and by that
gauge the Times's ranking differs much from mine.
For example, although its top performer in the shape of Bath is only two
notches lower in my list, it gave third place to Sussex which is bottom by
my measure - which is supported by the 22.5 per cent of Sussex's 1991 crop
in the unemployed-temporary slot.
Even so, since there is likely to be argument, I'd better specify the source
of the data on which my ranking is based. It is the official document,
University Management Statistics and Performance Indicators in the UK, just
published by the Universities Funding Council jointly with the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Abbey National cuts home loan rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National yesterday announced a cut in its mortgage interest rate which
will postpone until December the benefit of the recent fall in base rates
for most of its customers. But it will earn Abbey Pounds 19.5m in extra
income.
At the same time, it has postponed the earlier cut in its rates which was
due to take effect on November 1, along with those of most other mortgage
lenders.
Abbey National said yesterday that it would cut its standard variable
mortgage interest rate by 0.35 percentage points from December 1, bringing
the interest charged on a mortgage of less than Pounds 60,000 from the rate
of 9.95 per cent due to apply on November 1 down to 9.6 per cent. The new
rate applies immediately for new borrowers.
Most other lenders are charging 9.95 per cent or 9.99 per cent from November
1, while new customers benefit immediately.
Other lenders pointed out that the Abbey move appeared to be based on the
assumption that base rates would be cut by 0.5 percentage points by
December. 'This means that if there is a 0.5 per cent cut, Abbey National
will actually have widened its margins and not passed the benefit on in full
to its borrowers,' said one.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
expressed surprise at the decision not to apply the latest interest rate cut
until December. He said it would mean that the society would earn Pounds
19.5m in extra income between now and December 1 by keeping its rates at
their levels of before base rates fell to 9 per cent.
The cut is so small that other lenders believe it will not make much
difference to the housing market. They believe that it is no longer interest
rates, but uncertainty about the economy that is now holding back a recovery
in the housing market.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Treasury management set-up to alter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has altered its internal management structure to improve
decision-making after acting on suggestions from Mr Howard Davies, the
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry.
The move to set up an all-encompassing management board at the Treasury, in
place of a number of committees that decided on internal policies, is part
of a broad effort by the department to take on new ideas after criticism
that it has become cut off from academic economists and industry.
Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, asked Mr Davies for advice
last year. At that time, Mr Davies, who took over as head of the CBI in July
and is a former management consultant, was controller of the Audit
Commission, a government public-spending watchdog.
Mr Davies made his suggestions at a special meeting in the spring this year
with about 15 senior Treasury officials held at the chancellor's official
country residence.
The Treasury's new management board, headed by Sir Terry, includes the top
10 or so Treasury officials and meets once a week. It is largely concerned
with non-political judgments and does not in-clude government ministers.
The board replaces the Treasury's former policy co-ordinating committee
which considered broad questions of economic policy, and several other
loosely formed groups that considered questions of internal management such
as staff organisation.
Senior officials felt, after taking soundings from Mr Davies, that the
structure of the co-ordinating committee and the other committees had become
too unwieldy, which made it more difficult for the Treasury to focus its
thoughts and make timely decisions.
Mr Davies's work for the Treasury has now ended. He helped the Treasury,
unpaid, in his spare time from the Audit Commission. Some of the ideas
generated from his suggestions - such as the need for less secrecy, with
more contacts with outsiders - were outlined by Sir Terry to the Treasury's
top 70 officials at a meeting at the Institution of Civil Engineers earlier
this month.
Behind Sir Terry's decision to enlist Mr Davies for advice was the latter's
reputation as someone who combines knowledge of Whitehall with wide
experience in the business world. Mr Davies was a Treasury official for six
years until 1982, then spent the next five years with the McKinsey
management consultancy.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Number of business failures fell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of business failures fell for the second consecutive quarter,
according to figures from Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurer.
It said 1,780 companies collapsed in the three months to the end of
September, a decline of 7 per cent on the previous quarter, which was in
turn 8 per cent below the first-quarter figure.
Trade Indemnity's figures showed the number of failures as 51 per cent
higher than the same three months a year before. The group said the failure
rate continued to rise 12 to 18 months after the end of the early 1980s
recession.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey highlights consumer caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS have become much less keen over the past four months to make large
purchases, according to a survey of retail buying trends, Peter Marsh
writes.
Verdict Research, a consultancy specialising in retailing, says its index of
purchasing trends stood at 107 in September, the lowest since it started the
survey in June.
The consultancy says the numbers of people keen to buy houses and cars are
'particularly depressed'. It adds that 'short-term prospects of a
consumer-led economic recovery are very slim indeed'.
Verdict organises its survey by asking 2,000 people every month whether they
are 'seriously considering' buying one or more of a number of consumer items
 -including houses, cars, furniture, clothing worth at least Pounds 100 and
decorating goods, such as paint sufficient for a room.
The latest survey covers the first week of September and so was not affected
by withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism.

CONSTRUCTION of the privately financed Pounds 300m toll bridge across the
River Severn is under way. The bridge is three miles from the existing
bridge, which was built 23 years ago and cannot now handle the traffic
expected to be generated by an improved economy in south Wales.
Construction is being managed by an Anglo-French joint venture of John Laing

FT  14 OCT 92 / Confidence 'falls through floor' in north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence has plunged in the Yorkshire area and Humberside,
according to preliminary figures collated by Leeds Chamber of Commerce.
They show rapid deterioration in home markets and reversal of rising trends
in exports.
The data were collected before September 16, when sterling left the exchange
rate mechanism. Mr Ian Kelly, assistant director of the chamber, said
yesterday: 'We can assume from anecdotal evidence that the state of trade is
now much worse. We have been bouncing along the bottom for months. We have
now fallen through the floor.'
The indicators, drawn from regular quarterly surveys of business carried out
by all chambers in the region, come a day after 10 chambers of commerce in
north-west England warned that serious losses of industrial capacity were
likely if demand continued to fall. The regions jointly account for up to 18
per cent of UK gross domestic product and contain the bulk of northern
England's manufacturing industry.
Leeds chamber yesterday released the trend indicators from the combined
results of the surveys in the form of balance figures - the difference
between companies reporting increases in any factor and those reporting
falls.
Among manufacturers, the balance figure fell by 20 percentage points for
home orders, 16 points for home deliveries, 22 points for export deliveries
and 18 points for export orders from the previous quarter. All the figures
are now negative - more companies reporting falls than increases - ranging
from - 3 percentage points for export deliveries to - 17 points for home
orders.
In June, all four figures were positive and recovering strongly. Combined
with the results from chambers in north-west England, the statistics point
to a marked double dip to recession throughout the M62 motorway corridor -
the main wealth-producing band of northern England.
The Yorkshire and Humberside survey covered 529 manufacturers employing
70,616 people and 886 service companies with 91,554 employees.
Service companies reported similar, but less severe, trends to
manufacturers. Home sales fell 17 points to a balance of - 10 points, while
home orders also fell 17 points, this time to - 12 points.
The balance of export sales by service companies remained positive at 6
points, down from 16 points in June and 13 in March. Export orders fared
worse - down to 3 percentage points from 17 points in June and 11 points in
the first quarter.
In all sectors, labour-shedding intensified, with yet more job losses
forecast for the present quarter, particularly in manufacturing.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Cabinet may trim capital spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL PROJECTS are still among the areas that are likely to be cut as the
cabinet committee on public spending met yesterday and finished the second
stage of the public-expenditure round.
The six-strong committee, known in Whitehall as EDX, chaired by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, concluded its assessment of priorities for spending
in 1993-94. It will use its discussions today and tomorrow to focus on the
impact of those decisions on departmental programmes.
Officials are working towards an Autumn Statement in the week beginning
November 9, and the tough schedule of meetings is partly to compensate for
the decision not to continue the spending discussions during last week's
Tory party conference.
Ministers highlighted last week the need to keep the pressure on
public-sector pay and hinted at a squeeze on social security benefits.
Although they played down the more politically contentious course of cutting
back on capital spending, construction projects are still under threat.
Industrialists have already reacted with dismay to the prospect of large
reductions in capital investment, which is seen as having a vital
contribution to make to the survival of the construction industry.
Lord Prior, a former Tory cabinet minister and now chairman of GEC, the
defence group, said yesterday that it would be 'devastatingly bad' for
industry if the government cut back on capital projects in the present
public-spending review.
There are still ominous signs over some building expenditure. One Treasury
official highlighted the link between the signal in Mr John Major's speech
to conference last Friday about relaxing the rules for public and private
co-operation on infrastructure projects, and the expected cuts in the
Department of Transport's roads programme.
A few pieces of capital spending - such as central government support for
local light rail projects - have already been scrapped. Defence spending and
the Department of the Environment's housing budget have also been widely
identified as likely victims.
In spite of earlier suggestions that the Treasury might be trying to get
spending below the Pounds 244.5bn planning total for next year, the latest
signals are that the intention is to meet that target rather than cut
spending below it.
The Treasury keeps formally to the line that 'nothing is decided until
everything is decided'.
The view from spending departments, however, is that the first round of
'easy' cuts has already been made, and that the Treasury's aim now is to
give itself room to increase spending on a few high-priority programmes
while keeping within the overall target.
EDX has not yet decided whether departmental ministers should be invited to
put their arguments in person or whether they should have no opportunity to
query the committee's judgments until they go to full cabinet in early
November.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Rise in new businesses falls away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP rise in business start-ups that marked the second half of the
1980s slowed to a trickle last year, according to figures for businesses
registering for value added tax announced yesterday.
The wholesaling sector performed best as the recession deepened, while the
construction sector was worst affected.
The net number of VAT-registered businesses - new registrations minus
deregistrations - fell to 3,000 in 1991 from 55,000 a year earlier, and a
peak of 80,000 in 1989.
Some 206,000 businesses registered during the year, while 203,000
deregistered. The total of VAT-registered businesses was practically
unchanged at 1.7m, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
VAT registration figures do not record all businesses at the moment of
start-up, since many trade for a long time before reaching the VAT
threshold, which was annual turnover of Pounds 35,000 last year. Nor do
de-registrations indicate that a business has failed. But they are a good
guide to trends in numbers, the DTI said.
Wholesaling emerged as the most buoyant sector, recording a net increase of
5 per cent in the number of companies. Companies engaged in 'other services'
 -including advertising, management consultancy, entertainment and funeral
directors - grew by 4 per cent while finance, property and professional
services grew by 3 per cent.
The number of companies in all other industry sectors declined, with
particularly sharp falls occurring in the construction sector (4 per cent or
10,000 businesses) and transport (2 per cent), the DTI said.
In the 12 years to the end of 1991, all industry sectors, with the exception
of retailing and agriculture, recorded net increases in the number of active
companies. The retail sector underwent a 4 per cent decline in numbers while
the finance, property and professional services sector grew by more than 100
per cent.
The slowdown in the net number of new businesses was spread across all
regions of the UK. The 1991 figures include an adjustment for the increase
in the VAT registration threshold from Pounds 25,400 to Pounds 35,000 in the
March 1991 Budget.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Amount saved by NAO tops running costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Audit Office identified savings to the taxpayer of Pounds 200m
in the 1991-92 financial year, five times its Pounds 40m running costs,
according to its annual report, which is published today.
The savings resulted from the NAO's audit of the accounts of government
departments and public bodies, and its investigations of value-for-money in
particular activities.
That brings the total saved for the taxpayer over the past three years to
Pounds 500m, Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, says.
Greater freedom for the managers of public services requires close scrutiny
if standards for conducting public-sector business are to be maintained, he
adds.
The largest savings identified by the NAO come from the 47 value-for-money
studies carried out last year. They are estimated to have identified
economies of some Pounds 165m, including:
Savings of Pounds 30m a year in the running costs of married quarters
provided by the Ministry of Defence for members of the armed services.
Revised procedures on small-company tax relief, which saved the Inland
Revenue Pounds 12m a year.
Almost Pounds 1.5m from selling three of six surplus sites identified in a
study of the Metropolitan Police estate management.
Further savings of Pounds 35m were identified in the NAO's audits of the
accounts of 478 organisations in the public sector, including all government
departments, more than 70 executive agencies and a wide range of other
public bodies such as the Charity Commission and the Sports Council.
The accounts of 22 bodies were qualified, in eight cases because departments
had spent more than the amounts authorised by parliament. Other
qualifications related to uncertainty over accounting for sums of public
money.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Procter &amp; Gamble cancels claim in cosmetic advert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE, the US consumer product group, has retracted an
advertising claim that could have been understood to suggest that one of its
products - Clearasil, a medicated moisturiser - would leave every user
spot-free.
The magazine advertisement claimed: 'Moisturisers left me with spots; New
Clearasil moisturiser leaves me spot-free', and was subject to a complaint
that was upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority in its latest monthly
digest of complaints.
The ASA report said P&amp;G 're-examined their documentary evidence before
receiving the complaint' and 'recognised that it was insufficient to support
the impression that the product would necessarily leave every user spot-free
and they had discontinued the advertisement'.
The ASA upheld complaints against a number of other advertisements in the
health and dietary sectors, including promotions for products tackling
baldness, obesity and arthritis.
Complaints against Canon UK and Minolta, both on performance claims for
cameras, were upheld, as was a complaint against the London-based Institute
for Independent British Business.
The institute had taken out press advertising aimed at redundant and
early-retiring executives, claiming that annual income of Pounds 36,000
could be obtained, on a 12-month contract.
The advertisement failed to specify that the contract was available only to
those who participated in a development programme costing Pounds 6,227.50
and that, once employed, 20 per cent of the advertised annual earnings would
be payable to the advertisers.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Health food group fined Pounds 1,000 over 'IQ' pills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LARKHALL Natural Health, a health food company, was fined Pounds 1,000 and
ordered to pay Pounds 35,000 prosecution costs yesterday over claims that
its vitamin pills could improve the intelligence of children.
In a case brought by Shropshire trading standards officers, it was found
guilty of three charges of making false claims on packaging and literature
about Tandem IQ.
Mr Harry Hatchard, Shrewsbury stipendiary magistrate, said he did not regard
the marketing of the product as a deliberate hoax. He believed Dr Robert
Woodward, Larkhall chairman, genuinely thought the pills could enhance the
intelligence of children.
The company's offence was in not taking sufficient care in limiting claims.
The prosecution had alleged that labelling on the vitamin pill packets
conveyed the impression that the product could increase the IQ of the vast
majority of children.
There was no indication that only some children would benefit, said the
prosecution, which accepted that the claim could be true for a minority who
had a poor diet.
Mr Robin Spencer, for the trading standards department, said the letters
'IQ' on the front of the packaging were intended to convey 'intelligence
quotient'. He said the company had tried to disguise that inference by
stating on the back of the packets that IQ meant 'ideal quota'.
The magistrate said he was satisfied there was reliable evidence that only
children with a dietary deficiency were likely to benefit from vitamin and
mineral supplements.
He was also satisfied that a significant number of potential customers could
be misled into thinking that the tablets were capable of a general and
widespread effect in increasing the IQ of children.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Industry heyday
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDUSTRY'S heyday was in the mid 1950s, when output ran at 225m tonnes a
year. Since then, it has been in steady decline, under pressure from high
costs, restrictive practices and the growth of alternatives such as gas.
In the past five years, British Coal's mission to transform itself into a
commercial business has accelerated the shutdown of lossmaking pits. NM
Rothschild, the merchant bank advisers to the government, estimates that a
commercial business would have a maximum capacity of 50m-55m tonnes a year
by 2000.
That has meant sharp cuts in pits and jobs, and a rise in imports from
virtually nothing in the early 1970s to 20m tonnes a year now.
But output per man has more than doubled since the strike of the mid 1980s,
and the business has begun to make a profit.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Union fears lack of strike support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR NUM officials conceded yesterday that they might not win a ballot on
industrial action to fight the pit closures. With at least 12 months of coal
stocks at power stations, the amount of leverage a strike could apply is
minimal.
Some argue that action would at least disrupt the privatisation process of
what is left of the industry, but for that very reason the miners in pits
that will survive are unlikely to back a strike call.
Even though the shock and anger were widespread, it will not be enough to
bury the enmity between the Yorkshire-based National Union of Mineworkers,
which represents the majority of miners, and the Nottinghamshire-based Union
of Democratic Mineworkers, which was formed after the 1984-85 miners'
strike.
The UDM, which worked through the 1984-85 strike, and which received public
backing from Conservative ministers for its employee buy-out proposals, that
has the most reason to feel let down by the closures.
Some UDM officials such as Mr Neil Greatrex, president of the union's
Nottinghamshire area, are calling - like the NUM - for industrial action.
But the UDM's main approach is to try to challenge the government in the
courts, either through European Community competition law or through
contesting the abandonment of the colliery review procedure.
That procedure was strengthened in the 1984-85 strike to persuade Nacods,
the supervisors' union, not to join the strike. Mr Peter McNestry, Nacods
general secretary, said yesterday that he was considering legal action to
reinstate the procedure and at least slow down the closures.
The NUM, which still represents about two thirds of miners, will almost
certainly back industrial action tomorrow.
British Coal says: 'Industrial action would result in the withdrawal of all
ex-gratia redundancy payments'.
Mr Ken Capstick, vice-chairman of the Yorkshire area NUM, said this was the
'Alamo' for the industry, and argued that action would at least 'raise the
temperature' and draw attention to the unions' case for keeping a
competitive coal industry.
But a strike may not seem attractive to many young miners. The average age
is now 32 so that few would be old enough to qualify for the maximum
redundancy pay-off of Pounds 37,000. Equally, few will want to jeopardise
the money coming their way.
Also, Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM leader, might negate some of the public
sympathy for the miners if they took industrial action. Mr Ian Watts,
president of the Yorkshire area of the NUM's white-collar section,
disagreed.
'Arthur can be very inspiring. At the Labour conference he was one of the
few people that filled the hall and got a thunderous reception, despite
being so unpopular with the leadership,' he said.
Mr Scargill does not come up for re-election until next year, so, come what
may, he will be defending the NUM's Alamo.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Mansfield's misery fills a pint pot: Richard Donkin feels
the body blow to a town where job prospects are already bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KELVIN BREED, a 39-year-old face-worker at Clipstone Colliery, was
leaning against the bar of the Dukeries Social Club, a pint of beer in one
hand, when a friend broke the news that the pit was to close. His face
betrayed no emotion.
'Where can I find a job? I was in the Army before going down the pit 20
years ago. What sort of work is there for someone who knows how to kill and
work down a mine?' he said.
Clipstone is one of four pits in the Mansfield area that are to be axed,
with the loss of about 4,600 jobs. Staff at Mansfield's Civic Hall were
preparing to change the notice board that gives the town's unemployment
figures. Yesterday the total stood at just over 8,000. Within days the
unemployment rate for the town will top 20 per cent.
On some estates more than a third of householders will be out of work.
Mansfield is famous for two things - beer and coal. In the past two weeks,
Mansfield Bitter has become less the local brew and more a frame of mind in
this community of 55,000 people. For those without jobs, prospects are
bleak.
Just outside Mansfield centre at Forest Town, a few coal heaps behind coils
of barbed wire mark the remains of the old Mansfield colliery which closed
about three years ago.
But as the pits are consigned to history, Toray, the Japanese fabrics
manufacturer, is shaping the future. Its factory will employ 400 workers
when it comes fully on stream in the summer of 1994. About 70 vacancies have
been filled to date from 3,000 inquiries.
Many of those recruited for the first phase of operations next spring are
former miners whose ability to work as a team has impressed the Japanese
managers.
The Pounds 50m Toray factory is the only significant inward investment in
the area. 'The factory is very welcome but we would need 25 Torays next
week,' said Mr Jim Hawkins, the leader of Mansfield District Council.
'That's the size of the problem.'
The most worrying aspect of the closures is the lack of alternatives to
mining and the knock-on effect for other businesses. The town grew up around
mining at the turn of the century. Mansfield's coal had few impurities and
made ideal steam coal, prized by the steel industry and the railways. But
the local communities have seen more than 20,000 mining and related jobs
disappear in the East Midlands coal field since 1985.
The decline has been matched by the decline in textiles, Mansfield's other
large employer base. Iron foundries have also suffered. Once there were six
in the area. The foundry of James Maude and Co is the only survivor and
workers have been on short time. The brewery has also had cuts.
THE most severe effect of the closures outside British Coal is expected to
be among the hundreds of related businesses that supply the industry. Mr Mel
Brown, a former miner who runs a mine equipment refurbishing business
employing seven people, said: 'We are almost 99 per cent dependent on the
local pits. A lot of small businesses like ours will be directly affected.
All we can do is hope we can see it through.
Mr Ian Linney, chairman of Mansfield Newspapers, which publishes the weekly
Mansfield Chad, estimated that the closures would lead to the loss of as
many as 100,000 jobs in the region and cost more than Pounds 1bn to the
government in lost taxes and extra unemployment benefit.
'I don't think there is a hope in hell of filling this gap for 15 years,' he
said. 'As I see it the government has looked at only one side of the balance
sheet. I just cannot see the economic sense of this. If these were
inefficient pits unable to compete in the market I would probably agree with
these measures, but these pits are producing a 27.5 per cent return on
capital.'
The bewilderment is reflected throughout the community. Mr Philip Asquith,
Mansfield's Economic Development Officer, said: 'What this means is that we
will undergo all this misery and suffering for more expensive electricity at
the end of the day.'
The council welcomed yesterday's announcement that Mansfield would be given
assisted-area status for which it has lobbied hard. Mr Richard Goad, the
chief executive, said: 'It is something we desperately needed but in the
present climate we need a lot more and quickly.'
There have been some success stories from previous redundancies. Mr Tom
Wright used some of his redundancy and a bank loan to set up a sealant
business with his nephew when he left the Clipstone pit a year ago. He is
among a number of former miners who have been helped to start new businesses
by Mansfield, Sutton and Kirkby Training and Enterprise Council.
'It's been hard going but we have full order books and I have no regrets. I
could have sat at home and rotted away, but it wasn't for me.'
For every success story, though, there are countless failures. Some former
miners are resigned to a life on the dole. Mr Breed said he would look for
work. 'But if I can't find it,' he said, 'the government will have to keep
me. It put me here.'

MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, put the task of
improving UK manufacturers' competitiveness at the heart of his industrial
strategy yesterday. His comments were part of the government's response to
criticism of yesterday's pit closures announcement.
He defined the prime goal of the strategy as enabling industry to 'compete
in an increasingly competitive world'. He added: 'That means we have to
search for the opportunities for lower costs and for more effective
products.'
His remarks followed criticism by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British industry, who said business was frustrated at the
lack of a thought-out industrial strategy.
Pointing to the present level of subsidies for British Coal of Pounds 100m a
month, Mr Heseltine criticised those calling for legislation to prevent the
closures. He said such a move would 'make our manufacturing base less
competitive'.
'If you are arguing that I should subsidise the coal industry, then you have
to argue that that is the best use of national resources,' he said. 'If you
are trying to make British industry competitive, which is the only way out
of this recession, then helping them to contain their costs - possibly even
to reduce their costs - is a significant part of that process.'
Describing the industrial and economic case for rationalisation as
'unanswerable', he said that savings to electricity consumers of Pounds 300m
 -applied uniformly - implied 'householders' electricity bills up to around
3 per cent lower than would otherwise have been the case'. Governments had
always tailored domestic coal production to the scale of demand, he argued.
Mr Heseltine made little attempt to disguise that the announcement comes at
a particularly difficult time for the government. The 30,000 job losses will
swell the growing ranks of the unemployed, while the Pounds 1bn cost of the
proposed redundancy payments comes with the public-sector borrowing
requirement threatening to spiral upwards.
The timing may also make for a vituperative passage of the paving bill for
coal and rail privatisation through its committee stage in the House of
Lords. Ministers had confessed to not relishing the prospect even before
yesterday.
Mr Heseltine said he had hoped to inform MPs of the closures in a
parliamentary statement next week, but had changed his plans in the light of
widespread 'leaks and speculation'.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, called on Mr Heseltine
to intervene to halt the closures. It was 'a bad energy strategy and a worse
economic policy,' he said. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury
spokesman, described the closures as 'a fatal body blow' that would increase
Britain's trade deficit.

FT  14 OCT 92 / NCB chief blames 'mad' dash for gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL CLARKE, British Coal's chairman, blamed the 'economic madness' of
Britain's rush to switch from coal to gas for electricity generation for
yesterday's sweeping programme of pit closures.
The 'dash for gas', he warned, would push up electricity prices and result
in a huge excess of generating capacity. Plans for gas-fired power stations
already announced would squeeze 30m tonnes of coal a year out of the market.
'A sizeable portion of the electricity generation market has been shut off
for coal,' Mr Clarke said. He stressed that the new gas stations would
produce electricity more expensively than coal stations they were driving
out of business.
The dash for gas was prompted by the discovery of huge natural gas supplies
under the North Sea. The first of a new generation of gas-fired power
stations was opened earlier this month. By some estimates, gas might account
for 20 per cent of the market by the middle of the decade.
The attraction of gas is that power stations are quick and cheap to build.
Gas is easy to transport, and is environmentally friendly.
Many of the stations are being built by electricity distribution companies
keen to escape the duopoly run by National Power and PowerGen in England and
Wales. Because they are allowed to pass through all generation costs to the
consumer, they have been criticised for failing to ensure the cost of the
gas is economic.
A group of coal community interests and electricity consumers has challenged
Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to investigate gas
contracts and rule them uneconomic. He has declined to take specific action
and is to be challenged in court.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday: 'The
investment in gas is taking place as a result of decisions by people to
invest money in economically viable enterprises.'

FT  14 OCT 92 / Shake-up comes as little surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL'S restructuring came as no surprise yesterday to most of the
groups that have expressed an interest in acquiring the state-owned company.
Most pointed out that the shape of the industry proposed was little
different from that in a leaked report prepared last year by NM Rothschild,
the merchant banker that is advising the government on the privatisation.
East Midlands Electricity said: 'What is now required is an explanation of
the government's intentions for the privatisation of the industry.'
The company is part of a consortium that includes the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers; Sir David White, the deputy chairman of NFC; and Mr George
Guise, a former director of Consolidated Gold Fields. It is advised by
Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, said it was a sad day for the mining
communities, but potential purchasers now had a clearer idea of the future
shape of the industry.
Other groups that have expressed interest in acquiring some or all of
British Coal also include Hanson, Anglo-United, the chemicals company that
owns Coalite smokeless fuel, and the private coal companies Young Group,
Ryan Group and Budge Mining.
The consortium involving East Midlands Electricity said it was negotiating
with both UK and foreign mining groups to find two and possibly three
additional partners.
It is proposing that Brit-ish Coal should be split into two groups. The
southern one would include all fields up to and including South Yorkshire.
The northern group would comprise the remaining pits.
East Midlands Electricity said if a split proved impossible it was
interested in the entire company.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Communities face uphill task in spite of Pounds 1bn aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PACKAGE of aid worth Pounds 1bn for coalfield areas affected by pit
closures was outlined yesterday by the government. But experience of earlier
closures suggests that the measures are unlikely to prevent a big rise in
local joblessness.
The money will cover redundancy payments of up to Pounds 37,000, depending
on length of service and weekly earnings, as well as measures aimed at
regenerating local economies.
The 30,000 redundancies announced yesterday bring to about 170,000 the
number of miners who have lost their jobs since the end of the miners'
strike in March 1985.
The link between pit closures and local unemployment is not straightforward
in areas that are depressed, but unemployment levels in 'travel to work'
areas affected by pit closures are on average about 3 percentage points
higher than the national figure of 9.9 per cent.
The picture is worse in the mining communities, with parts of Barnsley, for
example, suffering unemployment of 20 per cent.
Recent government projections indicated that unemployment in travel to work
areas might rise by an average of almost 2 percentage points as a result of
the 29 pit closures then envisaged.
Since 1987, the main body charged with finding jobs for miners has been
British Coal Enterprise. BCE says it has resettled 80 per cent of the 20,000
former miners' who have approached it - about a third of those made
redundant since it started work.
Many miners return immediately to the industry, employed by private
contractors on short-term contracts. Many others move into driving, security
and warehousing jobs, where BCE concedes they earn less than they did at the
pit. A 1988 study of Yorkshire miners found that 10 per cent of former
miners who had found work were earning between Pounds 70 and Pounds 100 a
week less than they had with British Coal.
Mr Steve Clemerson, BCE's outplacement manager, said: 'We would like
everyone to come to us, but there are those who find work for themselves,
take early retirement or simply want nothing more to do with British Coal or
its subsidiaries.'
The Coalfields Communities Campaign, an alliance of local authorities,
argues that BCE-aided workers often displace other local labour, so that the
overall level of unemployment in an area is unaffected. The campaign says
coalfield areas need a package like the one Corby's steelworkers got when
they lost their jobs in 1980.
For the next three years coalfield areas will benefit from Pounds 135m under
the Rechar programme, an EC initiative intended to regenerate the areas.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIX executives from five of Japan's leading printing companies were
yesterday arrested on suspicion of sharing profits of more than Y100m
(Pounds 485,000) after rigging their bids for Y670m contract to print
security seals for a central government agency.
The arrests by the Tokyo district prosecutor's office follow an
investigation into the way the five companies fixed their bids for the
contract to supply the social insurance agency.
The case is likely to fuel foreign criticism that Japan's system of public
sector procurement is prone to collusion among suppliers.
The high profile arrests, made during raids on the companies' premises, are
a signal of the significance which the authorities attach to the case.
The executives arrested include two officials from Dai Nippon Printing,
Japan's largest printing group and a manager from each of Toppan Moore,
Kobayashi Kirokushi, Hitachi Information Systems, a software house and BF, a
Hitachi affiliate.
The companies are alleged to have met three days before lodging apparently
competing bids for a contract to print a specially designed security seal
which the social insurance agency introduced for documents sent to
pensioners.
The executives are accused of agreeing that Toppan Moore should be allowed
to win the competitive bidding with a bid of Y670m. Toppan Moore then paid
each of the other companies between Y30m and Y60m from its inflated profits
on the contract.
It is thought that Toppan Moore added about Y2 to the price for printing
each of the special labels which cost about Y10 to print, inflating its
profits by more than Y120m.
The social insurance agency introduced the seals in 1989. It buys about 175m
a year through six-monthly competitive bids among a small number of
specialist printers.

<TEXT>
ELEVEN senior officials of the Democratic Liberal party (DLP) quit yesterday
in the latest indication that South Korea's ruling party could disintegrate
just two months before the country's presidential election.
The defections are part of a growing revolt within the DLP against the
party's presidential nominee, Mr Kim Young-sam, a former opposition leader
who joined the DLP in 1990.
The exodus of other party members, including MPs, is expected this week
after the resignation last weekend of Mr Park Tae-joon, party co-chairman
and leader of the majority faction.
The dissident DLP members are likely to form a new political party to
challenge Mr Kim Young-sam, who is the current leading candidate, and Mr Kim
Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition Democratic party.
Dissatisfaction against Mr Kim Young-sam is strong within the DLP majority
faction loyal to President Roh Tae-woo.
They resent the growing power of Mr Kim, who commands only a minority of the
party's members.
But some Roh faction members are disturbed that a DLP split could deliver
the election to Mr Kim Dae-jung, and they are urging party unity.
The new party being discussed by the former DLP members may nominate Mr Park
as their presidential candidate or Mr Kang Young-hun, a former military
general who served under President Roh as prime minister.

THE Philippines expects to start negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) next month on a medium-term financing programme to
support the new government's economic development plan, writes Jose Galang
in Manila.
Mr Ramon del Rosario, the finance secretary, said yesterday the proposed
three-year financing plan would replace the current 18-month standby
arrangement that expires next March.
Without disclosing the amount to be sought, Mr del Rosario said the new
programme would be 'growth oriented', as opposed to the austerity and
stabilisation themes of the series of short-term standby arrangements that
Manila had concluded with the IMF since the local financial crisis in 1983.
The IMF's extended fund facility (EFF) will be tapped for the new programme.
According to other monetary officials, the Philippines may seek up to
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 587m) for its 'growth-oriented' economic scheme.
Funds releases for the final stage of the present standby facility were
approved late last week by the IMF executive board in Washington, after a
favourable report on Philippine economic performance.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Kanemaru likely to resign from LDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S most powerful politician, Mr Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather' of the
ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), last night said he would resign from
the party and the parliament in response to public outrage over his
violation of political funding laws.
But the suggestion of resignation was characteristically Kanemaru. Even Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was puzzled by the intentions of the
'godfather' and the Japanese public wondered whether the resignation would
be permanent or merely one more strategic turn by a master strategist.
Mr Kanemaru, 78, was said by colleagues to be planning a formal announcement
today, but senior members of his faction, the largest in the LDP, were
already brawling over their share of his power, which is considerable. The
faction has the final say on most important matters of policy and personnel.
From early yesterday, Mr Kanemaru received officials from his faction, some
of whom said he had decided to retire, while others suggested he had yet to
make a final decision. Mr Miyazawa, who owes his position to the
machinations of Mr Kanemaru, appeared confused by the day's events, and
heard second-hand of his intentions.
The controversy began in late August, when Mr Kanemaru announced that he had
received Y500m (Pounds 2.4m) from a scandal-tainted parcel delivery company,
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Even though the amount clearly exceeded the Y1.5m limit
on funds a politician can receive from one company, Mr Kanemaru apparently
believed he would not be pursued by prosecutors.
Having created a controversy, Mr Kanemaru retired to his Tokyo house for
more than a month, negotiating indirectly with prosecutors, who allowed him
to draft his confession at home and merely sent him a notice that he should
pay a Y200,000 fine.
The lenient treatment outraged ordinary Japanese, and petitions were
circulated demanding that he quit.
Mr Kanemaru presumed the pressure would soon fade, but the calls for his
resignation have grown in recent days, with a government minister suggesting
on Monday that he must leave. The minister said the violation was
unacceptable, as were Mr Kanemaru's dealings with gangsters, whose good
offices he apparently used to silence protests against the LDP by extreme
right groups.
The same groups were cruising Tokyo streets in their sound vans last night
warning that Mr Kanemaru's departure would allow a former prime minister, Mr
Noboru Takeshita, to regain control of the faction and eventually to become
prime minister again. Mr Takeshita was forced to resign three years ago
after having been implicated in a stocks-for-favours scandal.
However, the faction is in danger of splitting. Opponents of Mr Kanemaru's
chosen successor, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, are attempting to muster enough support
to force him to share power with them. Policy-making will become even more
tortured than usual, as the most influential politicians struggle to secure
their positions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE industrial investment, which has been falling for almost two years,
is still depressed, according to official figures for new machinery orders
published yesterday.
The Economic Planning Agency said private sector machinery orders in August,
excluding shipbuilding and electricity suppliers, rose by 3.9 per cent from
the month before.
However the increase was largely due to an extraordinary 204 per cent rise
in orders from oil and coal producers.
Excluding this surge which is likely to be temporary, overall private sector
orders for new machinery fell by 2.4 per cent in August from the month
before to a level 20 per cent below August 1991.
The level of new machinery orders from the private sector is a closley
watched indicator of investment trends. Private sector investment in plant
and equipment, which accounts for about a fifth of Japanese gross national
product, has been cut back severely as manufacturers cut costs in the face
of a steep fall in domestic demand.
In the late 1980s investment, which grew at a rate of about 15 per cent a
year, was one of the main engines of economic growth.
Car industry orders rose by 32 per cent to Y46bn (Pounds 223m) from July,
but the level of orders is still about 15 per cent below the Y54bn of August
1991. Orders from the electronics industry, which rose by 6.7 per cent on
July, were a third below their Y92bn level of August 1991.
The paper, chemicals, rubber, ceramics and food industries saw falls in
August ranging between 16 per cent and 45 per cent. Non-manufacturing
machinery orders fell 12 per cent in August from the month before with
information services orders down 63 per cent. Construction orders fell 15
per cent.

THE National Australia Bank will consider calling off its NZDollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 478m) takeover bid for the Bank of New Zealand if there is a full
public investigation of the bank, Mr Don Argus, NAB's chief executive said
yesterday.
He was responding to rising calls for an inquiry into the bank's operations
and alleged secret deals between 1986 and 1991, when it had required
taxpayer support.
The Securities Commission is due to meet today to review its previous
decision that there is no need for an investigation.
Mr Argus said similar inquiries into Australian banks had been costly and
debilitating and such an inquiry had the potential to severely damage BNZ's
franchise in New Zealand.
The campaign for an inquiry began late last year following the sacking of Mr
Winston Peters, the former minister of Maori Affairs, who has become an arch
critic of the government. He has since released a steady stream of leaked
documents in parliament, alleging misdemeanors by the bank's directors and
others.
On Monday, Mr Lindsay Pyne, the BNZ's chief executive, said Mr Peters'
allegations were 'unsubstantiated, opportunistic, and self serving' and that
he had produced no new Evidence. Mr Pyne said alleged improper underwriting
fees had been fully disclosed, improper lending was in fact proper, insider
trading claims had been rejected by the Securities Commission, tax scams
allegations had been rejected by the Inland Revenue, claims of falsified
accounts were completely wrong, and altered audit report claims were 'sheer
fantasy'.
The New Zealand government recorded a deficit of NZDollars 2.53bn (Pounds
807m) in the year to June 30, compared with a forecast NZDollars 3.16bn,
writes Terry Hall.
Interest rates fell and the exchange rate firmed following yesterday's
announcement.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Angola deal takes shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HUAMBO, ANGOLA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A POSSIBLE political solution was beginning to take shape in Angola last
night, despite an outbreak of fighting in several parts of Luanda and the
mobilisation of rebel Unita troops in several provinces.
Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign minister, has emerged as a key
mediator in Angola's tense political crisis and is negotiating a possible
deal between Mr Jonas Savimbi, the hardline leader of the former South
African and US-backed rebel Unita movement, and President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, the leader of the former Marxist MPLA government.
Mr Botha yesterday flew to the central Angolan city of Huambo and met Mr
Savimbi, who has alleged that Unita's defeat in the war-shattered country's
first democratic elections was rigged.
In a four-hour meeting, attended by the Financial Times, Mr Botha began the
process of hammering out a political deal between Unita and the MPLA to pull
the country back from renewed conflict.
He also urged Mr Savimbi to take the 'moral high ground' and pledge himself
to 'discussion and dialogue' rather than threaten the southern African
region with renewed civil war.
Mr Botha's mission came as the United Nations and western observers are
beginning to accept that the elections have been flawed, more out of
incompetence and ignorance than out of design, and that it is time to broker
a political deal between the two sides.
Convinced that alleged irregularities in the electoral process had cast
doubt on the credibility of the outcome of the poll, Mr Botha put forward
the outlines of a possible political compromise on genuine power sharing in
a government of national unity.
He also suggested some negotiation on a new form of administration of the
provinces such as Bie, Huambo, Benguela and Cuando Cubango where Unita swept
the polls.
'The irregularities of the elections, the small margin the president has
above 50 per cent and the starkness of the choice must force each side to
reach for a political solution,' he said.
'It will take time to ripen and we need a balance of interests to see that
resorting to force will only make both sides losers but that striking a deal
will make both sides winners.'
Mr Savimbi asked Mr Botha to 'convince President dos Santos that he needs us
to bring this country together. There is an important part of the country
which does not want him anymore. But I accept that we also need President
dos Santos.'
Mr Savimbi also promised that he would not 'use force to achieve a political
solution but I categorically reject the electoral fraud,' he said. 'We need
another pragmatic and just solution which is not imposed on us.'
He said he could not accept the election results, which show him trailing Mr
dos Santos with about 39 per cent to Mr dos Santos's 50 per cent after 90
per cent of the results were announced.
If Mr dos Santos does not get more than 50 per cent then the law dictates a
second round run-off between the two candidates.
Mr Botha took several messages from Mr Savimbi back to Luanda for President
dos Santos, including his agreement to meet the president 'anytime anywhere'
and a warning that the government should not publish final election results,
expected today, before the conclusion of an investigation into Unita
allegations of fraud.
'I want you also to tell dos Santos that I can listen to you because you
have been my friend and you have never betrayed me like others have betrayed
me,' the guerrilla chief told Mr Botha.

could place a serious obstacle in the way of early progress to a
multi-racial interim government.
Mr de Klerk told a special session of the country's white-dominated
parliament that he did not expect the South African Communist party (SACP),
the ANC's closest ally, to form part of the first multi-racial government
'because they do not have the support of the people'.
This is likely to be contested by the ANC, many of whose top leaders are
also officials of the Communist party.
Communist leaders have made clear they intend to contest the first
multi-racial elections in alliance with the ANC.
Following the deaths of 26 people during an ANC march, led by SACP leaders,
in the Ciskei black homeland, Mr de Klerk has taken a tougher line against
radicals in the ANC, whom he sees as frustrating talks on a new
constitution.
Mr Roelf Meyer, the minister of constitutional development, highlighted the
slow pace of these negotiations when he said on Monday night that he did not
expect the first all-party elections to take place before the end of next
year.
Mr de Klerk has recently come under sharp criticism from whites both inside
and outside his party for making too many concessions to the ANC, including
a recent agreement to free hundreds of political prisoners, some of whom
committed terrorist crimes.
Yesterday the president said the ANC would have to become a registered
political party before he would consider sharing power in an interim
government. 'I am not willing to form a government of national unity with
the ANC as it is now. It must get rid of the radicals . . . it must undergo
a transformation,' he said.
He added: 'It must get rid of the uniforms and the weapons . . . it must be
transformed from a militant movement into a political party.' ANC
spokeswoman Gill Marcus said the policy-making national executive committee
would consider Mr de Klerk's comments on Wednesday.
Wrapping up a two-day debate on multi-party democracy talks and measures to
combat the country's endemic political violence, Mr de Klerk said he would
never submit to radical pressure or hand power to a dominant majority.

THE DEATH toll in the Cairo earthquake rose yesterday to an estimated 450
people, with some 4,000 injured.
Casualty figures may range higher as the search for survivors continues in
collapsed buildings, many of them crumbling tenements, in poorer areas of
the city of 12m.
It has been one of Egypt's worst national disasters and prompted President
Hosni Mubarak to cut short a state visit to China.
Among the worst tragedies was the collapse of a 14-storey building in the
comfortable middle-class suburb of Heliopolis.
Early yesterday, rescue teams were still scrabbling through the debris with
little hope of finding anyone alive as tearful relatives looked on in
stunned disbelief.
In the poorer areas of the city hundreds of flimsy, jerry-built structures
were made uninhabitable.
According to official figures, more than 100 buildings collapsed or were
partly damaged, but this almost certainly underestimates the extent of the
destruction in a city where lax building codes are the rule rather than the
exception.
At Cairo's main Kasr el-Eini hospital, Dr Khayri al Samra, the
superintendent, said many injuries were caused by panic. People had suffered
fractures after jumping from swaying buildings or had been trampled
underfoot in the mad rush to escape wildly-shaking tenements. Others were
trapped in alleyways.
Fearing a second quake, thousands of people spent the warm night outdoors,
some driving into the desert and others taking refuge in the open areas of
private clubs.

ETHIOPIA'S central bank yesterday raised interest rates as part of a bold
package of economic reforms, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa.
Ethiopia hopes the reforms will encourage foreign donors to fund a
rehabilitation programme.
The official Ethiopian news agency announced that rates for personal and
business loans had been raised from 9 per cent to between 11 and 15 per
cent.
Interest rates on savings were increased from 6 per cent to 12 per cent.
The move caused jitters amongst businessmen and appears to have immediately
undermined foreign currency rates on the black market, economic analysts
said.
The government also raised wages of government workers by up to 110 per
cent, for the first time since Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in the
1974 Marxist revolution.

According to official figures, more than 100 buildings collapsed or were

destruction in a city where lax building codes are the rule rather than the

The quake hit just on peak hour as children were streaming out of schools
and office workers were returning home for a traditional late Egyptian
lunch. As the casualty toll mounted, the government broadcast urgent appeals
to motorists to stay off the roads to allow ambulances and fire engines
clear passage.
At Cairo's main Kasr el-Eini hospital, Dr Khayri al Samra, the
superintendent, reported that casualty numbers were the worst since the 1973
October war against Israel.
Many injuries, he said, were caused by panic. People had suffered fractures
after jumping from swaying buildings or had been trampled underfoot in the
mad rush to escape wildly-shaking tenements. Others were trapped in
alleyways.
Most schools were closed yesterday as the authorities checked structural
damage. Many among the 450 so far feared dead were children crushed while
escaping from classrooms.
Fearing a second quake, thousands of people spent the warm night outdoors,
some driving into the desert and others taking refuge in the open areas of
private clubs.
Egypt's famed monuments appear to have escaped unscathed. No damage was
reported to the Pyramids or to the Sphinx and museums survived more or less
intact. The Aswan High Dam, about 1,000 kilometres south of Cairo, was
unaffected.
Life in Cairo yesterday was returning to normal with most offices
functioning and streets filled with traffic. However, there were many
citizens with sad stories to tell.

<TEXT>
A NEW aviation trade dispute, between the US and Japan, loomed yesterday
when United Airlines, the Chicago-based carrier, said it might have to
postpone the start-up of a new service between New York, Tokyo and Sydney.
The service had been scheduled to start on October 25. However, United said
yesterday that, when it made its normal winter schedule filing, the Japanese
authorities refused to accept that portion of the schedule which covered the
new flight.
Instead they requested that a separate filing be made to cover the new
service - a demand which United refused, fearing that this would impede the
operation.
The US airline insisted yesterday that there was 'no legal basis for Japan
to refuse the schedule filing', and maintained that the new service was
authorised under the US-Japan Air Services Agreement, the bilateral aviation
accord between the two countries.
It said that the issue had been raised with the US Department of
Transportation and with the State Department and that United had asked them
'to ensure that Japan honour its international obligations'.
The potential trade dispute with Japan comes at a time when the US is
already battling to win greater access for its airlines to European markets.
That policy, in turn, generated tension earlier this year between the US and
both France and Germany.
Aviation relationships between the US and the UK are also at a delicate
stage.
British Airways is seeking to purchase a large minority stake in USAir, the
sixth biggest US carrier, and the big three US airlines insist that approval
for this deal should be conditioned on a much more liberal aviation
agreement between the two countries.
'Japan now seems to be joining the Europeans in limiting US carriers' access
to markets for which the US has negotiated and paid for in terms of
reciprocal access for carriers of those countries to US markets,' claimed Mr
Stephen Wolf, United's chairman yesterday
The US Department of Transportation said it was investigating the situation.

<TEXT>
CHINA Eastern Airlines, the Shanghai-based carrier, yesterday said it was
ordering five Airbus A340 four-engine widebody airliners worth about Dollars
555m (Pounds 311.7m), writes Paul Betts. The order reflects a boom in civil
aviation in China, which is currently seeking to modernise and expand its
domestic airline industry.
The Airbus order was announced in Hong Kong by Wang Lian, president of the
fast-growing Chinese regional carrier. China Eastern is one of the country's
six largest regional carriers which are expected to become increasingly
autonomous from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) by the end
of this year.
Wang said the airline was considering eventually floating its shares on
China's stock market as well as recruiting foreign expertise into its new
management. One problem facing China's regional carriers is a shortage of
qualified ground and air crew at a time of expanding business with the
introduction of western jets into domestic airline fleets.
China Eastern operates a large fleet of western aircraft including Airbus
A300s and A310s, McDonnell Douglas MD82s and MD11s, British Aerospace 146s,
Shorts 360s and De Havilland Dash-8s. It also has on order additional A300s
and Fokker 100 jets.

FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Oilseeds still block agreement on Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The principal stumbling block to a settlement of the Uruguay Round of talks
on world trade liberalisation is a still-yawning gap between the US and the
EC on Europe's oilseed subsidy regime, according to a leading US farm
lobbyist.
Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau, said, at the end of
two days in Brussels lobbying US-EC trade and agriculture negotiators as
they fought to settle a 20-month dispute over the EC's subsidised farm trade
regime, that he was not optimistic that differences on oilseeds could be
settled.
His mood yesterday contrasted with that of the negotiators, who despite the
apparently inconclusive end to negotiations on Monday night, appear
confident agreement can be reached.
This confidence has been underpinned by significant progress in settling two
issues at times felt to be intractable: US demands that the EC cut the
volume and the value of its subsidised farm exports, and EC demands that
compensation payments to European farmers for price cuts under the Common
Agriculture Policy reform should not be seen as subsidies, and so exempt
from any agreement on subsidy cuts.
'You don't have anything until you have everything,' Mr Kleckner warned,
pointing to considerable differences between the US and the EC on oilseed
production. US negotiators are demanding the EC cuts its output from the
current 13m tonnes a year to 7m tonnes in six years.
EC negotiators are currently refusing to cut below 9.5m tonnes.
He warned that failure to reach agreement in the next 10 days would 'make it
a dead certainty' the US will carry out threats to impose punitive tariffs
amounting to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 587m) on EC farm exports in retaliation for
alleged damage done to US farmers by the EC oilseeds regime.
'There's a little more time, but we are counting in days,' he said. 'If we
failed to reach an agreement, that would be dreadful for the Uruguay Round,
and for economies throughout the world.'
He insisted negotiators could be even further apart on the oilseeds dispute
than the public realised, largely because the EC's target of 9.5m tonnes
annual output will be based not on firm policy objectives, but on an
assumption that the CAP reforms, intended to reduce the acreage sown with
oilseeds, will automatically achieve the targeted reduction.
'It would create a firestorm of protest among US farmers if the
administration were to settle for anything less than a cut to 7m tonnes,' Mr
Kleckner said. 'The gap may not seem great, but we just can't believe the EC
figures are accurate.'
EC officials did not share Mr Kleckner's pessimism yesterday, as they
weighed the significance of the breakthroughs achieved on farmer
compensation and volume cuts for farm exports.
It is understood that US negotiators, in accommodating EC demands on
compensation, have agreed to nothing less than a re-drafting of relevant
parts of the draft Uruguay Round agreement published in late December last
year.
It will allow direct payments to farmers under production-limiting criteria
to be exempt from year-by-year reduction in subsidies.
In settling differences on the US demand for the EC to cut the volume of its
subsidised farm exports, three formulae have apparently been tabled:
the EC is willing to agree a 24 per cent cut in all farm products by the end
of six years, provided annual progress to that eventual target allows for 10
per cent 'swings', with certain products moving towards 24 per cent faster
than others.
the US accepts this proposal, but insists on the annual 'swings' being
limited to 4 per cent.
a standby proposal for volume cuts to be limited to 21 per cent at the end
of six years. This appears the least likely to be agreed upon.

FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Japan plays grudging game on trade - Gatt
Policy Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S professed faith in the multilateral trading system is undermined by
its readiness to accept bilateral 'managed trade' solutions to appease
trading partners, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) says in
a report published yesterday.
The country's grudging approach to trade liberalisation, undertaken largely
in response to pressure from trading partners, and the measures adopted to
reduce trade frictions, come in for strong criticism from the Gatt
secretariat.
The report calls on Japan, as the world's third biggest trader after the US
and the EC, to help promote the health of the multilateral trading system by
'more active reliance' on Gatt regulations, making more use of Gatt disputes
procedures and lowering trade barriers in protected sectors, notably
agriculture.
In its second review of Japan's trade policies and practices, Gatt says that
since 1990 Japan has continued to improve foreign access to its market,
especially for industrial products, in an effort to help reduce its
'persistent and growing' merchandise trade surplus. This topped Dollars
100bn last year, as recession dampened import demand.
However, many of the market-opening measures announced last August -
designed to boost imports by an extra Dollars 5bn over the next 18 months -
stemmed from commitments announced before 1990, the report says.
Increased financial and tax incentives aimed at promoting imports 'may even
help to increase Japan's trade surplus to the extent that access to
lower-cost imports contributes to stimulating exports'.
Gatt calls on Japan to implement a resource-efficient strategy that expands
foreign competition through removing existing impediments to imports.
Greater trade liberalisation, it says, 'should be pursued by Japan for its
own benefit, including long-run economic competitiveness, rather than seen
as a fix for bilateral imbalances'.
Nowhere is this more true than in the farming sector, one of the most
heavily subsidised in the industrialised world. Though Japan remains overall
the world's largest food importer, it continues to pursue a policy of
self-sufficiency in rice, including an import ban it has been battling to
preserve in talks on farm trade reform within the Uruguay Round of global
trade negotiations.
Assistance to farmers imposes an implicit tax on food consumption of around
11 per cent and costs the Japanese economy more than 1 per cent of gross
national product, according to OECD estimates.
Domestic food prices are, on average, double world levels, ranging up to
four to five times world prices for rice and milk products, and well over
three times for sugar.
A 'hard core of protection' also exists in certain industrial sectors such
as leather and leather footwear, textiles and clothing. Gatt argues that
liberalisation in these areas would promote structural adjustment at home
and benefit developing country exporters. In general, however, industrial
tariffs are low at 5.2 per cent on average and most import restrictions have
long since been scrapped.
Gatt also believes the protectionist effect of informal barriers -
government procurement practices, technical standards, anti-monopoly
legislation, the distribution system, keiretsu (industrial groupings) and
other business practices - 'may be less important than often claimed'.
Despite the emphasis put on these barriers by the US in particular, a recent
survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan ranked them well behind
other factors such as high fixed costs and staffing problems, the report
notes.
Though exports remain highly concentrated, with motor vehicles, machinery,
office equipment and telecommunications apparatus accounting for half total
export value, import patterns have been changing rapidly.
Manufactures accounted for more than half Japan's total imports last year,
compared with less than a third in 1985.
The regional pattern of trade has also changed. South-east Asia overtook the
US last year as Japan's biggest overseas market, partly because of trade
with Japanese subsidiaries in the region, taking 31 per cent of Japanese
exports compared with 29 per cent for the US and 19 per cent for the EC.
However, Tokyo remains wary of entering into any regional trading
arrangements that might provoke a retreat into rival trading blocs by the US
and EC and undermine the multilateral trading system.
Japan's stated support for the Gatt system contrasts with its readiness to
enter bilateral trading agreements instigated by its main trading partners,
the report argues. It concedes that most such deals - such as the 1991
semiconductor accord with the US - carefully avoid discrimination.
But, it says, the agreement on car parts earlier this year between Tokyo and
Washington appears to endorse specific objectives for purchases of US parts
by Japanese car manufacturers. Other US/Japan deals have also been attacked
as discriminatory by third governments. Similarly, Japan has shown continued
willingness to manage sensitive exports through 'voluntary' export
restraints and export monitoring arrangements on products where it is highly
competitive.
Japan thus 'gives the impression of a country which, while seeking to reduce
frictions with all trading partners, favours growth of grey-area measures
and managed trade in certain sensitive areas'. This, Gatt warns, contributes
to erosion of confidence in the multilateral trading system and of the
system itself.

JAPAN put up a vigorous defence of its trading policies to Gatt's governing
council which yesterday concluded discussion of the critical secretariat
report, writes Frances Williams.
Mr Kazuo Asakai, a senior trade official in Geneva, said Japan was committed
to free, non-discriminatory trade in accordance with Gatt principles. The
main reason Japan undertook voluntary export restraints was that importing
countries were not acting in conformity with Gatt rules. These measures were
taken as emergency or unavoidable expedients and to the minimal extent, he
said.
Mr Asakai also queried Gatt's analysis of its import incentives, which he
said were analogous to tariff cuts, not export subsidies. He defended
Japan's stance on farm trade in the Uruguay Round which he said should take
non-trade aspects such as food security into account.

FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Turkey's patent law ready
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kaan Dericioglu, an Ankara lawyer, has spent 10 years on a government
commission preparing a patent law for Turkey. The current draft, the eighth
since 1951, is now back in the cabinet in-tray awaiting ministerial approval
before being submitted to parliament.
The patent law, a major bone of contention with both the US and the EC, is
seen as a test case of Turkey's commitment to liberalise its economy. At a
symposium in Ankara this week, Mr Tahir Kose, Turkey's trade and industry
minister, predicted a new patent law would be passed before the year ends.
The new draft, despite some shortcomings, is welcomed as a 'vast
improvement' by western diplomats in Ankara. But problems remain. The draft
updates a 1879 patent law. As originally drafted, it included full
protection for pharmaceuticals, which was explicitly excluded in earlier
proposals. Since the commission finished its work in 1990, the State
Planning Organisation (SPO) has moved to water down the draft. Already, the
law is only to apply to drugs after a 10-year transition period. Turkey is
also to introduce compulsory licensing, which requires a foreign company to
license a drug with a local producer even if he does market it in Turkey.
The law provides no protection during the so-called pipeline period, during
which new molecules are registered, and the drugs go through clinical trials
before going to the health ministry for approval. 'Taken with the transition
period, this means that for the next 22 years no new molecule will be
protected in Turkey,' one foreign executive said.
Mr Ergun Ozsunay, professor of civil law at Istanbul University and a member
of the commission, believes that even if the draft gets through cabinet in
its present form, it may meet opposition in parliament, where nationalist
sentiment on issues such as patent remain strong. Remembering the bitter
experience of earlier failures, Mr Dericioglu suggests it might be advisable
to exclude pharmaceuticals, at least to have some form of patent protection
on the statute books.
For many ordinary Turks, the commercial priorities of the foreign
multinational drug companies seem increasingly at odds with the health needs
of Turkey's poor. But the battle lines are now drawn between the foreign
pharmaceutical concerns, and the health ministry and its supporters among
big local producers.
Industry officials point out, of total world market of about 3,000 drugs,
just 72 products are now under patent. In Turkey, patentable products
account for 20 per cent of total annual drug sales of Dollars 1bn (Pounds
500m), the rest being generics or cheap copies of patent brand-name drugs.
Of the 72 products, 24 are imitated by some 200 local copies.
The health ministry, backed by the large local drug concerns, is arguing
that patent law would provide carte blanche for foreign companies to raise
prices. Foreign drug companies estimate the cost to Turkey of a new patent
law at just Dollars 25m - the difference in unit price between the patented
product and the copy.
Those opposing the law fear losing market share to foreign competition.
Eczacibasi, Turkey's largest drug company, with 16 per cent of the market,
is arguably well able to compete with foreign companies, and publicly is
committed to protection. But Mr Ayhan Suskun, the technical director, argues
for a transition period to let local companies catch up. 'If you are
planning to be in the international market, you have to have a patent law.
The question is, how soon it should be applied,' he says. Industry officials
are concerned any backsliding on the patent law will deepen a worsening
crisis in the sector.

<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE in Venezuela's ability to return to stability following a failed
military uprising in February has been shaken by renewed political turmoil.
President Carlos Andres Perez admitted this week that several officers in
the armed forces had been questioned by the military intelligence office.
Newspaper reports, which could not be independently confirmed, have
indicated that both military officers and civilians had been questioned
about an alleged conspiracy against the government.
The reports came after several weeks of heightened political tension,
following an attempted assassination, death threats against allegedly
corrupt politicians and renewed student protests.
This week the government was forced to deny initial reports that a
presidential assassination attempt was made on Monday when Mr Perez was
visiting the western state of Zulia.
According to official reports, a lorry drove at speed past a bus carrying Mr
Perez and other officials following the inauguration of a new hospital in
the town of Paraguaipoa. The truck refused orders to halt, and the
president's security team shot and killed the driver and his passenger,
identified as Guajira Indians who were said to be drunk.
The incident follows an attempt last month on the life of Mr Antonio Rios,
the former president of Venezuela's largest labour organisation, the CTV.
The alleged perpetrator, Cesar Eduardo Pena La Cruz, said he was working
with a new political organisation which was dedicated to killing prominent
Venezuelan figures identified as 'corrupt'. Mr Rios, who was shot and
seriously wounded, is facing charges of influence peddling. He has denied
wrongdoing.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Bush plays Clinton draft issue to the full: Revised economic
blueprint for second term being drawn up by James Baker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush served warning yesterday he will not stop criticising
Mr Bill Clinton for avoiding the draft and taking part in demonstrations
against the Vietnam war 23 years ago. It was time, he said, for his
Democratic opponent in the presidential election 'to level with the American
people,' writes Jurek Martin.
The second string to his arguments in the two remaining presidential
debates, Mr Bush indicated, was that the economy was not in such bad shape.
Mr James Baker, his chief of staff, was preparing a revised economic
blueprint for a second term, to be implemented by a completely new
administration team under Mr Baker's direction, at least initially. Mr
Clinton was instantly dismissive of Mr Baker's new broom. 'They're on a
losing streak and the coach wants to fire the team. In America, when you
have a losing season the coach gets fired, not the team.'
Appearing unannounced on a morning television programme commemorating the
200th anniversary of the building of the White House, Mr Bush said
repeatedly that he was not impugning Mr Clinton's patriotism but his
judgment and character in protesting against the war while Americans were
held prisoner by the North Vietnamese.
He directly addressed Mr Clinton's most effective intervention in Sunday's
debate. 'He talked about my father. My father served his country and my
father believed in duty, honour and country. And I, like my father, do not
believe in McCarthyism and this isn't McCarthyism.' Mr Bush said Mr Clinton
'ought to come clean on the draft. I mean, a lot of kids ducked the draft,
some of them went to Canada. But they didn't try to have it both ways;
protect the political viability and then tell different stories about it.'
He bristled when asked if he, too, should 'level' with the country about his
knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair, saying he and his staff had answered
thousands of questions on the subject.
Mr Clinton responded by saying his draft record and Iran-Contra were not
directly comparable because 'the meagre evidence we have supports my account
while. . . the documentary evidence of the phone calls of two of (Mr Bush's)
cabinet members, the record of the meeting he was in, all that stuff,
contradicts his account.'
The president's answers suggest a continuing conviction that Mr Clinton can
be brought down by the issue and a certainty he will try to make the most of
it in the next two debates. To Mr Bush's critics and to the Clinton campaign
this smacks of desperation.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Caracas to accelerate sell-off programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Venezuelan government plans to accelerate its privatisation programme
with the sale of more than 100 enterprises and minority shareholdings by the
end of 1993.
Mr Carlos Hernandez Delfino, president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund
responsible for privatisation, said the programme would include the sale of
three electricity generation and distribution companies - Enelbar, Enelven
and Enelco. The sale of the Planta Centro thermal power generation plant is
also planned.
The privatisation programme has been almost moribund since an attempted
military coup in February, which marked the beginning of a period of
political turmoil in the country. Government figures suggest only Dollars
17m (Pounds 9.5m) has been raised in privatisations so far this year.
Mr Hernandez Delfino said late last week in an interview that the government
was 'totally committed to the privatisation programme.'
Many enterprises that belonged to the defunct Venezuelan Development Corp
can be sold as soon as the government is ready. The assets of one, Ceramicas
Cumana, will be auctioned tomorrow.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Department of Justice is investigating Mr William Sessions, director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and his wife for the possible
violation of ethics rules.
The probe of Mr Sessions comes just three days after the Justice Department
called in the FBI to investigate whether Central Intelligence Agency or
Justice Department officials deliberately concealed intelligence reports
relating to the scandal over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) of illegal loans
made to Iraq by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
(BNL).
The investigation of Mr Sessions and his wife - concerning allegations made
in anonymous letters that they misused government cars and aircraft and that
Mrs Sessions misused her FBI building pass - triggered suggestions by
Democrats that the probe may be a politically inspired attempt to intimidate
the FBI.
Mr Paul McNulty, a Justice Department spokesman, yesterday denied these
suggestions, which came from congressional investigators. 'That is utter
nonsense. There is no tension between us. It just ain't so,' he said.
The FBI fracas comes in the wake of a public row between the Justice
Department and the CIA over the BNL affair.
The FBI acknowledged yesterday that there had been 'some confusion reflected
in the media concerning the investigation of certain issues relating to the
Department of Justice prosecution in the BNL case.'
Last weekend Mr William Barr, the attorney-general, called in the FBI, which
reports to him, and asked it to investigate possible misconduct by senior
administration officials in the handling of CIA reports. The reports, which
were withheld from Judge Marvin Shoob, the federal judge who presided over
the BNL case, contradicted the central premise of the government's argument
in court that the Dollars 5bn of Iraqi loans were single-handedly
orchestrated by BNL's former Atlanta branch manager.
An aide to Senator David Boren, chairman of the Senate intelligence
committee, confirmed yesterday that Mr Sessions had assured him the FBI
would conduct its BNL probe without sharing its information with the Justice
Department, whose officials might be targets of the investigation.
But Mr John Collingwood, the FBI spokesman, said yesterday the FBI and
Justice officials would work closely together on the BNL probe.
He said Mr Sessions told Mr Boren the FBI would pursue the investigation
wherever it led. 'What the director meant to tell Senator Boren is that he
does not expect to be inhibited by Justice or by anyone else,' Mr
Collingwood said.

<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S parliament yesterday voted overwhelmingly for the appointment of
the manager of the world's largest missile factory, Mr Leonid Kuchma, as the
country's new prime minister.
As head of the Yuzhmash plant in eastern Ukraine, Mr Kuchma is a political
unknown. But he was proposed by President Leonid Kravchuk and won the
support both of nationalist MPs and the majority ex-communist bloc in the
legislature.
His appointment represents a victory for Ukraine's increasingly vocal
industrial lobby but its implications for Ukraine's faltering economy are
unclear.
A western diplomat described Mr Kuchma, a spare, white-haired engineer with
a reputation as a good manager, as 'a Ukrainian Volsky' - a reference to the
leader of the Russian industrial lobby who is seeking to put a brake on
Russian economic reform.
Fierce criticism of the handling of the Ukrainian economy - which is plagued
by inflation of more than 30 per cent a month and a steep fall in industrial
production - forced Mr Vitold Fokin, Ukraine's first prime minister, to
resign last month.
In a brief policy statement, Mr Kuchma said his goal was to 'transform the
post-socialist economy into a market economy'. But, echoing the policy of
the previous government, he said that reform must be 'evolutionary' and
guided by 'a combination of administrative and market methods'.
He suggested that as a transitional step to privatisation all Ukrainian
enterprises should be transformed into joint stock companies, in which the
government would retain control over the majority of shares.
This approach is bound to cause concern among western experts, who have
warned that it would only superficially change the form of ownership and
would not weaken the government's stranglehold over the economy.
The consensus inside parliament yesterday contrasted sharply with violence
on its steps as hundreds of police clashed with students demonstrating for
new elections and Ukraine's exit from the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
Two students were taken to hospital and two dozen students and a western
cameraman detained by regular and riot police armed with tear gas and rubber
truncheons.
The parliament, which was elected under restrictive conditions in 1990 and
is dominated by ex-communists, is under fierce attack from the student
protesters. Two years ago hunger-striking students forced a prime minister
to resign.
Meanwhile, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said it
would concentrate on financial sector reform and privatisation, agriculture,
energy, transport and environmental protection in its strategy for Ukraine.
Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, said the role of the bank should be to
assist the country's commitment to democracy and market economics and
encourage Ukraine in its efforts to transform the economy through greater
reliance on market forces rather than central planning and state control.
A giant Ukrainian military transport plane crashed in a forest near Kiev
yesterday, killing all nine crew.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are significant gaps in the efforts of industrial nations to spread
economic, management and political expertise to the former Soviet republics,
says a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
Reviewing 'technical assistance', or the spread of know-how to the newly
independent states, the OECD said:
Western donor countries were providing insufficient guidance to the
republics on environmental problems.
The donors' aid efforts, in both the humanitarian and know-how sectors, gave
too little attention to the republics' need to improve shelter, housing and
construction.
The number of projects aimed at building democracy was, at only 2 per cent,
too small in view of the republics' inexperience in such matters.
The provision of expertise about health and social safety nets is neglected
in some republics.
The geographical spread of technical assistance is uneven, with the needs of
the central Asian republics being crowded out by larger republics.
The OECD's report was prepared for a meeting in Tokyo later this month of
ministers and officials from up to 70 donor and recipient countries and
international organisations. This will take a critical look at the provision
of technical and humanitarian aid to the former Soviet republics.
Aid officials say pressure is growing to abandon 'horizontal' co-ordination
of assistance across the republics of the former Soviet Union in favour of
aid that is tailored to the needs of individual states.

SERBIAN police yesterday used tear gas and truncheons to disperse a
demonstration by ethnic Albanians in Pristina, Kosovo, the mostly Albanian
province in southern Serbia.
Army jets swooped over the Kosovo capital as the protesters gathered for the
second day, demanding the opening of Albanian language schools and
university.
Mr Ibrahim Rugova, the Albanian leader, said in Pristina yesterday the
violent break-up of the demonstration was a provocation by Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic intended to show he still controlled the province.
Scores were killed in 1989 when the Serbian president forcibly brought
Kosovo under direct rule by Belgrade. Mr Milosevic may use Kosovo, seen by
Serbs as the cradle of their civilisation, to rally popular support in
Serbia, flagging after 15 months of war and United Nations sanctions.
Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, said yesterday it would be
easier to get sanctions lifted if Mr Milosevic resigned. Mr Milosevic is
seen by the international community as the main instigator of the war in
Bosnia.
To re-integrate Kosovo's 1.9m ethnic Albanian population into Yugoslavia, Mr
Panic has pledged to reform the educational system, boycotted by Albanians
after Serbia imposed its own curriculum.
The United States was last night consulting its allies on ways to enforce a
no-fly zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina and considering pushing for a tougher
United Nations resolution, Reuter reports from Washington. The UN Security
Council imposed the no-fly zone last Friday.
State Department spokesman Joe Snyder said Bosnian Serbs flew numerous
sorties, including bombing raids, on Saturday. There were no flights on
Sunday and Monday but Bosnian Serb aircraft started operating again
yesterday, he said. However, UN officials said there had been no violations
since Saturday.
Meanwhile Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has offered to
remove all his aircraft from Bosnia and station them at airfields in the
rump Yugoslav state under UN observers. The UN said Mr Karadzic made the
offer at Geneva yesterday in a meeting with Lord Owen, co-chairman of the
peace conference, in an attempt to facilitate implementation of the
resolution on the no-fly zone.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Banks row stifles Russian oil output
</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN LLOYD

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW between western bankers has blocked finance for desperately needed
equipment to help Russia arrest its rapid decline in oil production.
The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development has a plan to finance
purchases of oil and gas equipment through credits from western commercial
banks and the US Exim bank.
Oil output has plunged from a peak of 570m tonnes in 1987 to about 395m this
year and an estimated 340m-350m in 1993. Russian oil producers in the Tyumen
region have a Dollars 1.5bn shopping list for production equipment, 5bn,
although so far only Dollars 150m of that has been costed and agreed.
However, the entire project has been held up by objections from the World
Bank. The issue, over which body has first call on repayments, now has to
solved by Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank chairman, and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
acting Russian prime minister.
The Russians aim to pay back the credits with revenue gained from the extra
production which the new equipment will bring, a pledge which the EBRD, Exim
Bank and other banks are willing to accept.
However, under the World Bank's 'negative pledge' rule, it will not permit
other lenders to be treated more favourably than it in the repayment of
credits - and sees a pledge of future oil output to the EBRD, when no such
pledge has been made to it, as more favourable treatment.
The World Bank is providing more than Dollars 1bn of credits for various
projects.
The issue is important, since the World Bank must protect its 'Triple A'
credit rating from possible dilution by such deals. Russian officials are
now suggesting deals of this kind to other future lenders, but are being
held back by the World Bank's objections.
Efforts by the World Bank and the Russian government to circumvent the
problem have met stiff resistance from the Bank's lawyers. The nervousness
of all concerned is rooted in the perception that Russia now is a high risk
debtor, suffering from a chronic lack of hard currency and unable to pay
either principal or interest on existing loans.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has intervened to lift the travel ban on Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, on 'humanitarian grounds' so
he can attend the funeral of former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in
Germany at the weekend. Russia's constitutional court imposed the ban in an
attempt to force Mr Gorbachev to appear at hearings deciding the fate of the
Communist party.

ITALY yesterday reiterated its opposition to a draft EC directive on
maternity rights, leaving social affairs ministers without their hoped-for
compromise during an informal meeting in Wales. The council of ministers has
until October 19 to adopt the directive.
Today deputy ambassadors of the EC will try to forge an agreement after
yesterday's meeting offered the Italians two small olive branches. These
included a review of the directive five years after its implementation.
In alliance with the European Commission and parliament, Italian ministers
have repeatedly vetoed a watered-down package tabled by the Dutch and backed
by the 10 other governments. The Italians are seeking 16 weeks maternity pay
at a level of at least 80 per cent of the woman's average wage. The other 11
member states have agreed to introduce a right to receive 14 weeks at a
minimum of statutory sick pay.

<TEXT>
RADICAL right-wing movements will present the most serious threat since 1945
to Germany's political stability, two German specialists warned this week.
A large number of Germans in the east and west already supported militant
right-wing opposition to asylum-seekers entering and living in Germany,
according to Mr Ernst Uhrlau of the Hamburg Agency for the Protection of the
Constitution, which collects and evaluates information about German
extremist movements. They had become disillusioned with the existing main
parties.
He feared that extremist parties would come to represent the 'silent
majority' of Germans who were being pushed towards the extreme right.
Right-wing extremists, whom he numbered at at least 60,000, had provoked
1,400 assaults this year.
Mr Uhrlau was speaking at a conference organised by the Aspen Institute in
Berlin.
Mr Claus Leggewie, professor of political science at the University of
Giessen, said he believed that as much as 20 per cent of the German
electorate had passively supported right-wing extremist views in the past.
He feared such people would actively support parties espousing those views
in the 1994 national elections.
In Bonn yesterday, leaders of Germany's governing parties agreed that asylum
seekers from states deemed free of political persecution should be expelled
immediately without a court hearing. However, the draft plan requires a
constitutional amendment which depends on the backing of the opposition
Social Democrats.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Violence mars Italian strike: Four-hour stoppage by at least
6m workers takes toll of industry and transport in staggered action across
the country
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST 6m workers yesterday took part in Italy's tenth general strike in
12 years, hitting industry and transport in a four-hour staggered stoppage
marred by violence in Milan.
Mr Sergio d'Antoni, leader of the CISL, the Christian Democrat-controlled
confederation, was slightly injured on the lip when union militants and
right wing extremists joined forces to hurl coins and bolts at the speaker's
podium as he addressed a mass meeting. Milan was also the scene of violence
last month during a four-hour regional stoppage.
The strike had been pressed for by the largest and most combative of Italy's
three union confederations, the CGIL, which is run largely by former
communists. Called in protest against proposed welfare cuts in the 1993
budget, it was the culmination of a series of co-ordinated regional
four-hour general stoppages begun last month and organised by all three
confederations.
However, the strength of the protest was undermined by public divisions
between the unions, a lack of public support, and a growing appreciation of
the government's lack of room for manoeuvre.
The CISL and the Social Democrat-oriented UIL accepted the national stoppage
with reluctance and deliberately called it for yesterday, too soon for the
statutory two weeks' notice needed to include essential services.
Yesterday's action seemed as much as anything a controlled exercise in
allowing the rank and file to vent their fears and frustrations over
impending austerity, reduced welfare benefits and the loss of the link
between wages and inflation.
The demonstrators themselves appeared mostly to be on the streets out of a
mix of nostalgia for the mass protests of the seventies and confused
impotence in the face of an economic crisis.
The system of indexed wages, the scala mobile, was abolished by mutual
agreement in July between the union leaders, Confindustria, the employers'
confederation, and the government. The agreement provoked a groundswell of
protest against the union leadership, especially the CGIL, causing Mr Bruno
Trentin, its leader, to offer his resignation. He agreed to stay on only
after a special congress, but he has since been treading a tightrope between
placating this discontent and supporting his friend and former CGIL
colleague, Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister.
His task has been complicated both by the tough measures proposed in the
1993 budget capping pensions and reducing national health benefits, and by
the prospect of wages being eroded next year by the inflationary effects of
the lira's devaluation.
The Amato government has little room for manoeuvre in making concessions
without reducing anticipated revenues and in the process undermining
domestic business and international confidence. Equally, if the government
holds firm, union leaders risk being exposed as weak.
The authority of the three confederations has already been eroded by
declining membership and the formation of workers' committees in key sectors
such as the railways, education and air transport. The CGIL also reflects
the continuing ideological turmoil caused by the collapse of communism and
the split in the former Italian Communist Party. At least 15 per cent of the
CGIL consists of hardline communists threatening to form their own
confederation.

FT  14 OCT 92 / The colour is grey for Paris spring fashions: Economic chill
takes the brightness out of French designers' big week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS morning the Paris fashion designers will unveil the first of their
spring collections in the sumptuous Cour Carree of the Louvre museum against
the gloomy economic backdrop of the global economic slowdown and this
autumn's currency crisis.
The Paris designers, like the rest of the international fashion industry,
are already bruised by two years of recession in the US and the downturn in
Europe. After a decade of uninterrupted growth their combined sales fell by
about 11 per cent to FFr4.55bn (Pounds 530m) last year, according to the
Chambre Syndicale de laCouture, the body which represents the French fashion
houses.
This year has been worse. Until recently the designers could count on
healthy demand from Japan, by far their most dynamic market in the 1980s, to
compensate for the slowdown in the west. But since the collapse of the Tokyo
stock market in March, sales in Japan have fallen sharply.
'The market is in a very sensitive state, although we had anticipated most
of the problems apart from the difficulties in Japan,' said Mr Michel
Pietrini, chairman of Lanvin, one of the oldest French fashion houses which
is staging a lavish relaunch in Paris this weekend.
There are already signs of strain among the fashion houses. Jean Colonna, a
leading young Paris designer, filed for bankruptcy this spring, although he
has since managed to start up in business again. Yves Saint-Laurent, the
bastion of France's fashion establishment, barely broke even in the first
half of this year. Recent reports in the Japanese press suggest that some of
the Tokyo designers may stop showing in Paris next season, which could
damage the city's credibility as the international fashion centre.
The outlook is worse. The immediate problem is the currency crisis which
could depress sales of this week's collections because of the French franc's
strength against key currencies such as the US dollar and Italian lire.
'Of course, the currency crisis is of prime concern,' said Mr Bernard
Arnault, chairman of the LVMH luxury goods group, whose fashion interests
include Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix and Givenchy. 'But it isn't the
first and it won't be the last.'
The short-term pressures of currencies and recession have disguised the
longer term problems facing the fashion designers. One issue is the impact
of the expansion of the new breed of luxury goods groups, notably LVMH and
Dunhill, which this summer bought the Karl Lagerfeld fashion house and also
hired Mr Lagerfeld as chief designer for the Chloe collection which will be
shown this afternoon.
These groups have deployed their financial resources to raise the cost of
competing in designer fashion. Advertising budgets have escalated, as have
the bills for fashion shows. The super-models, Linda Evangelista and Claudia
Schiffer, can command fees of Dollars 10,000 to Dollars 15,000 a show
because the big houses are willing, and able, to pay them.
Mr Arnault has sunk at least Pounds 18m into launching Lacroix. L'Oreal, the
cosmetics company, and Orcofi, the luxury goods consortium, are relaunching
Lanvin on a similar scale. Such budgets, like the super-models' fees, are
well beyond the means of independent houses and have intensified the
financial pressure on young designers such as Jean Colonna.
The designers must also adjust to the change in consumer tastes away from
the ostentatious affluence that dominated the 1980s and was so beneficial to
sales of designer fashion. 'Flamboyance is out,' said Mr Arnault. 'Today
consumers prefer to indulge themselves rather than to show off.'
So far the designers' have failed to respond. Fashion in the early 1990s has
polarised between the baggy, black recyclage (recycled) look of the young
designers, Jean Colonna and Martin Margiela, and the fin de siecle stylistic
excesses of the established houses.
The 'hippy de luxe' look seen at last week's fashion shows in Milan marked
the start of the designers' attempts to adapt to the new era. It is now the
turn of the Paris designers to show what they can do - however chilly the
economic climate may be.

reports. Economists had mostly forecast 0.2 per cent, so the franc, Paris
shares and government bonds all rose on the news. But the response was muted
as the figures showed a continuation of the low inflation trend the
government has maintained with high interest rates and tight spending
policies for several years.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S powerful savings bank movement yesterday urged the Bundesbank to
stand firm in its tight monetary policy, and resist calls from both home and
abroad to relax interest rates.
Mr Helmut Geiger, president of the German savings bank federation, delivered
a staunch defence of the central bank's policy, criticising countries like
the US, Britain and Italy for being too lax in their monetary control.
He also underlined the continuing doubts in the German business and banking
community about the Maastricht treaty, saying the recent turbulence on the
currency markets showed that economic and monetary union should not be
introduced too hastily.
Mr Geiger's support for the Bundesbank, while predictable, will provide
welcome public backing at a moment when calls for interest rate relaxation,
in order to prevent the German economy tipping into prolonged recession, are
multiplying.
'We call on the Bundesbank to stand firm by its money supply policy,' Mr
Geiger said. 'This is the only chance we have to create reliable
preconditions for economic growth. The Bundesbank must not give in to
pressure. A premature cut in interest rates might be understood by the
public as a capitulation to monetary depreciation. It might cause market
rates to rise rather than fall.'
He flatly rejected accusations that the Bundesbank was itself responsible
for the upheavals in the currency markets. 'That responsibility lies with
those governments who simply failed to adjust their currency parities in
good time to the changes in their value,' he said.
As for the Maastricht treaty, he warned that European union would only
succeed if currency union worked as a force for integration, not dynamite to
blow the EC apart.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Danes head for clash with EC over treaty

<TEXT>
DENMARK appears to be on a collision course with its European Community
partners by calling for Maastricht treaty changes which may make a second
round of Community-wide ratification necessary next year.
The scale of Maastricht amendments proposed by a majority of parties in the
Danish Folketing (parliament) suggests that some renegotiation of the treaty
may be required.
This would directly oppose the line taken by the other 11 states after
Denmark rejected the treaty in its referendum in June. The rest of the EC
then decided to press ahead with the ratification process, hoping to regain
Danish support for Maastricht in a second referendum next year.
A first reaction to latest Danish thinking could come today when Prime
Minister Poul Schluter and Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister,
meet President Francois Mitterrand in Paris.
During the last few months, support for a hard-line approach to the problem
caused by the Danish No has increased in the Danish parliament. This policy
is supported above all by three non-government parties, the Social Democrats
(SDP), the Socialist People's party (SPP) and the Radical Liberals. Together
the three have a majority of the seats in the Folketing.
Spokesmen for all three parties say that special arrangements for Denmark
must be built into the treaty with a legally binding character.
Mr Holger Nielsen, leader of the SPP, which looks certain to play a crucial
role in any Danish compromise on Maastricht, says he 'cannot imagine' a
solution which will not involve a new ratification process for other member
states.
Mr Nielsen is pressing for changes above all in the treaty's language on
defence and monetary arrangements. He also wants to slow the drive to
European union in other areas such as police co-operation.
Arguing that significant alterations will be needed to make the treaty
palatable to the electorate, Mr Nielsen says: 'We cannot just have the same
text and some candy-floss. If we just have candy-floss, the Danes will not
be in favour.'
'It is difficult to see how a result can be achieved which will not require
new ratification by the other states,' commented Mr Niels Helveg Petersen,
European market affairs spokesman of the Radicals, after a meeting of the
Folketing's market affairs committee.

FT  14 OCT 92 / EC pressed to back Pounds 3bn steel restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S steelmakers, hit by overcapacity, recession and cheap non-EC
imports, are planning a radical restructuring which could cost more than
Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.14bn) and lead to the loss of 50,000 jobs.
The chairmen of the EC's 15 largest steel companies have asked the
Commission and member states for aid to cover the redundancies. They also
want 'guidelines' on market developments, and swift action against unfair
competition from outside the Community.
The move could raise fears among EC free-traders, like Sir Leon Brittan,
competition commissioner, that the industry wants to return to the sheltered
and heavily-subsidised steel regime of the 1980s.
It could also add to trade tensions with the US, which is already looking to
impose duties on EC steel products.
Mr Dietrich von Husen, director general of Eurofer, the confederation of EC
iron and steel producers, said yesterday there was a real danger that the
efforts and successes of the last restructuring would be put in doubt. 'If
we don't take urgent action, 1992 and 1993 will be catastrophic,' he said.
Commission officials said they hoped to react positively to the steelmakers'
proposals. The problem would be finding sufficient financial resources. Coal
and steel treaty reserves amount to Ecu750m (Pounds 590m), of which Ecu500m
is in principle available.
The steel industry's plan would involve:
Restructuring, including a redundancy programme which could cost at least
Ecu2bn over the next three to four years. Eurofer indicated that related
costs, such as incentives for plant closures and reduction of supply, could
more than double that figure. State aids will be 'resisted', said the
steelmakers, but if member states grant subsidies then capacity and
production will be reduced in return.
Market regulation. The Commission would draw up guidelines on production,
consumption, exports and imports, to help the industry adapt to changing
demand.
Protection from increased imports, for example, by accelerating the
procedure for examining dumping complaints against third countries.
The industry is particularly concerned about low-price imports from east
European countries and the former Soviet Union, which have increased by 70
per cent over the last year.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Down the fast track to a pot of gold: Dublin will defend the
punt strongly within the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government has felt shocked and helpless over the past month as it
has watched sterling plunge to unprecedented levels against the punt and the
UK stumble forward in search of a new economic policy to replace the one
left in tatters when sterling abandoned the ERM.
The economic tidal wave from across the Irish Sea has forced Dublin to spend
about half its currency reserves in defending the punt. It has also obliged
it to renew borrowing overseas, has pushed up interest rates by three
percentage points and has placed an estimated 30,000 jobs at risk, in a
country with 300,000 unemployed - 21 per cent of the labour force.
When the Irish delegation arrives in Birmingham for the EC summit this
Friday, they will doubtless acknowledge and welcome assurances from Prime
Minister John Major that in due course sterling will be back inside the ERM
and that his government will keep Britain, Ireland's main trading partner,
firmly at the heart of Europe.
But they will not be making any plans on the basis of those assurances.
Instead, their voices will be among those arguing that the ERM crisis has
demonstrated the urgency of moving even faster towards monetary union and a
single EC currency. That point has been made many times by Mr Albert
Reynolds, the prime minister, since the ERM crisis began, and he is likely
to restate it in Birmingham.
Mr Reynolds, told the Dail (parliament) last week that government policy
'is, and will continue to be, the maintenance of a firm exchange rate within
the narrow band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism'.
He said: 'Beyond the single market beckons the prospect of economic and
monetary union which, through its co-ordination of economic and monetary
policies, a single central bank and ultimately a single currency, will
enable us in a market devoid of currency and interest rate fluctuations, to
gain for our people a much higher standard of living.'
That pot of gold lying at the foot of the EC rainbow has convinced the
government that the cost of defending the currency over the coming months
will be worth bearing.
Those costs have been spelt out by independent sources in the past week.
Goodbody stockbrokers in Dublin estimate that at an exchange rate of Pounds
1.05 to the punt, IPounds 250m will be lost by Irish manufacturers to UK
competitors over one year. The 3 per cent interest rate increase will
meanwhile reduce investment by IPounds 200m, and personal consumption by
IPounds 100m.
Indeed, it is the high interest rates rather than the exchange rate itself,
which are seen by most analysts as potentially more damaging. Mr Jim Lacey,
chief executive of the National Irish Bank, said last week that high
interest rates would reduce growth this year and impact adversely next year.
'Real interest rates in Ireland now stand at 14 per cent. This is a heavy
burden to bear and is the price of our link with the D-Mark.'
He and most Irish economists conclude, however, that there is no viable
alternative and that interest rates can best be brought down by defending
the punt. 'Interest rates will remain high over coming months and will only
decline once German investors decide to put their money into this country
again,' he said.
In his speech to the Dail, Mr Reynolds said: 'Our position is based on the
conviction of the markets that government finances are firmly under control.
Nothing can be done to shake that conviction. This is not the time to start
thinking that we have leeway to increase the level of government borrowing.'
He noted that economic stability and low inflation 'was brought about by the
consensus approach we adopted of forming an alliance between the government,
employers, trade unions and farmers.'
A continuation of the consensus through the difficulties ahead is vital if
the government is to succeed in maintaining the current exchange rate
policy. So far it has held.
To reinforce it, the government will be looking for reassurance in
Birmingham that the proposed Delors II package of substantial increases in
structural and cohesion funds, of which Ireland will be a major beneficiary,
has not been discarded in the wake of the ERM crisis.
Mr Maurice Doyle, central bank governor, sounded a warning this week saying:
'Realistically, these (funds) are likely to fall short of what is required,
and must in any case be regarded as a second-best alternative to fiscal
federalism. While European integration provides opportunities for less
prosperous regions, it does not in any way guarantee an adequate narrowing
of differences in real living standards between countries.'
If such reassurance is not forthcoming, then it should not be surprising to
hear a growing number of Irish voices being raised to question whether being
in the fast track to monetary union is indeed worth the cost of
ever-lengthening dole queues.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Brussels fails to agree curb on powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission last night failed to endorse its radical proposals
to curb its own powers, compounding the failure of the European Community's
member states at last week's foreign ministers' meeting to define the
principle of subsidiarity.
The risk now is that the emergency EC summit in Birmingham on Friday could
magnify the impression of Community disarray.
The defining of subsidiarity - that the EC should act only where national or
local measures would not be appropriate - was the issue which Mr John Major,
the prime minister and holder of the EC presidency, had hoped to make the
centrepiece of the summit in an effort to demonstrate to sceptics in his own
Conservative party and across Europe that the powers of the Commission were
being reined in.
'John Major's problem is that everbody expects the member states to have a
good go at the Commission to demonstrate that Brussels has been tamed,' a
senior Commission official said. 'The timetable now clearly points towards
(December's summit in) Edinburgh, and it's difficult to see what people can
do in Birmingham, because there's now no real agenda.'
Concern that Birmingham will produce no substantive results was evident in
Bonn yesterday, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl met Mr Jacques Delors, the
president of the European Commission.
German officials insisted that a 'German initiative' is not being pressed by
Mr Kohl. However, they admit that he is very anxious to ensure that the
Birmingham summit does not collapse in disarray.
In addition to the delay on agreeing subsidiarity:
Debate on reform of the exchange rate mechanism in the wake of last month's
currency turmoil has been taken off the Birmingham agenda in case it
provokes new market instability.
A strategy to recapture Danish voters' support for the Maastricht treaty
cannot get under way until the power struggle between Brussels and the
member states is resolved.
Summit efforts to win EC endorsement of the emerging Uruguay Round world
trade deal are likely to be muted because of the risk of isolating France,
which is determined to protect its subsidised cereals exports.
Although there will be no agreed text on subsidiarity at Birmingham, Mr
Delors will report to the 12 members on Brussels' attempt to define the
division of powers in the EC, and the summit is expected to produce a
statement of intent on subsidiarity.
Nevertheless, although Mr Delors failed to convince his colleagues with his
subsidiarity proposals, he received a favourable reception from ambassadors
of the 12 when he presented the text to them on Monday.
One ambassador described the text as 'a useful first step' towards easing
public fears about Brussels' powers and centralisation.
But he and other EC officials acknowledged that the EC would have to wait
until Edinburgh for agreed details on how subsidiarity will work.
Mr Delors' subsidiarity plan, which would not require renegotiating
Maastricht, aims to clarify that power in the EC rests with the member
states unless specified otherwise. It would also devolve some policy and
management to the 12.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Consortium pledges support of Pounds 30m in ITN bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of four media com-panies yesterday made an offer for Independent
Television News, including a Pounds 30m commitment to support the news
organisation.
The move by Carlton Communications, Central Independent Television, London
Weekend Television and Reuters, the news and information group, comes at a
time of financial uncertainty for ITN.
The news organisation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the ITV companies, is
facing a Pounds 25m deficit over the next five years on the lease of its
headquarters in London's Gray's Inn Road.
An agreement in principle has just been reached on a five-year contract,
worth an average of about Pounds 53m a year, to supply news to ITV.
The consortium is offering Pounds 1 a share for all of the 400,000 existing
Pounds 1 shares in ITN that its members do not already own. The Pounds 30m
commitment will take the form of a subscription for new equity. Half the
money would be raised by partly paid shares, with the rest on call when ITN
needed it.
A condition of the deal is that the consortium members would each hold at
least 20 per cent. The final 20 per cent of the enlarged share capital would
be available to the existing shareholders.
Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, said last night: 'ITN
is very important to the ITV network. There appeared to be a logjam. This is
a solution.'
One ITN shareholder suggested yesterday an alternative to the offer could be
a mixture of equity finance from existing shareholders, plus a bank loan.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, a majority of the ITN shares is supposed to
be held by non-ITV companies by the end of 1994. Because of that, ITN has
had talks with three US broadcasting organisations - ABC, CBS and CNN -
about the possibility of them taking a stake. Meanwhile, the ITV companies
are likely to lobby the government to be allowed to retain a majority stake.
Mr Richard Dunn, the chairman of ITN, said last night the consortium's
proposal would be considered at an ITN board meeting on Monday. A meeting of
all shareholders will be called.
There are close links between the consortium members. Carlton is a 20 per
cent shareholder in Central and a fellow shareholder with LWT in Good
Morning TV, the breakfast television company. Carlton and LWT are also the
shareholders in London News, the seven-day television news service. Mr Green
is a non-executive director of Reuters.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Anger over scale of pit closures: British Coal to shut down
31 mines - 30,000 jobs to go - Pounds 1bn aid package pledged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor, CATHERINE MILTON, DAVID GOODHART
and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL announced sweeping cuts in its operations yesterday with the
shutdown of 31 pits and the loss of 30,000 jobs.
The closures, which will start this week and mark British Coal's first
compulsory redundancies, will devastate large areas of the east Midlands and
north-east England where unemployment is already high.
The government immediately announced a Pounds 1bn package of redundancy
payments and measures to help the affected areas. But the severity of the
company's action, which will leave it with only 19 pits, set off a wave of
protest and anger from trade unions and coal communities over what they
claimed was the virtual destruction of the coal industry.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, said the cuts, which include the
mothballing of four collieries, were necessary 'in light of harsh conditions
in the electricity market and the urgent need to bring supply and demand
back into balance'. He said it was clear that the company's sales of coal to
UK electricity generators, its main customers, would be sharply reduced next
year to 40m tonnes from 65m tonnes this year.
'However much we dislike this - and we dislike this very strongly - it is a
reality that we have to live with,' he said.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said he knew the
announcement would come 'as a severe shock to a great many miners and their
families'. He went on: 'But British Coal cannot go on producing coal which
cannot be sold. These decisions have been taken only after the most careful
consideration. They are painful but they are essential to secure the
industry's future and cannot be postponed.'
He said the remaining coal industry 'will be well placed to achieve a
profitable and sustainable future'. The government hopes to privatise
British Coal next year.
For Labour, Mr Robin Cook, the party's trade and industry spokesman, called
on Mr Heseltine to intervene 'in the same way that the German government
intervenes to help German industry'. He said taxpayers would pay 'millions
more in redundancy' for miners to claim unemployment benefit instead of
producing coal.
As part of its aid package, the government will give assisted area status to
Doncaster and Barnsley in South Yorkshire and Mansfield, Nottinghamshire.
About Pounds 11m of European Community money will be available, with
possibly more to come.
Government agencies and British Coal Enterprise, its job creation arm, will
also work to rehabilitate stricken communities. British Coal said the usual
procedures for appealing against pit closure would be suspended, and Mr
Clarke warned miners that protest action would result in lost redundancy
entitlements.
Union leaders greeted the announcement with dismay. Mr Arthur Scargill,
leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, described it as an act of
industrial vandalism and urged his members to take industrial action.
Officials of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which broke away from the
NUM in the 1984-85 strike, were even more stunned, having apparently won
support for an employee buy-out plan from ministers.
The union said it was considering an injunction against British Coal's
abandonment of the review procedure and might invoke EC competition law. The
UDM, which estimates the total cost of closure at Pounds 8bn, also called
for a public inquiry into the future of the industry.
Mr Peter McNestry, leader of the Nacods pit supervisors union, said direct
job losses could be as high as 45,000 because of the number of private
contractors working in pits.
British Coal is negotiating new long-term supply contracts with the
electricity generators which will be based for the first time on commercial
rather than subsidised prices. Although this is forcing British Coal to
shrink, it will also drive down the cost of power generation.

HENDERSON Administration said yesterday it was close to buying fellow fund
management company Touche Remnant from the French bank Societe Generale. The
combined group would have more than Pounds 9bn of funds under management and
would be the largest manager in the UK investment trust sector.
The proposed deal may herald a period of rationalisation in the fund
management sector, where companies have battled sluggish stock markets and a
lack of enthusiasm of private investors in recent years. A survey by Touche
Ross Management Consultants recently found that half of all unit trust
companies earned marginal profits or made losses in 1991.
Henderson has seen a decline in its funds under management from Pounds
9.57bn at the end of September 1987 to about Pounds 7bn at present.
On the institutional side, Henderson has lost a number of pension fund
clients because of poor investment performance in 1987 and 1988. In retail,
Henderson lacks the direct sales force operated by many of its bank and
insurance company rivals.
Touche Remnant also lacks a direct sales force, but it will add Pounds 1.3bn
of funds in the investment trust sector, where the quality of earnings is
high.
Henderson said the enlarged group should also achieve economies of scale in
head office, advertising and technology costs. Each group has a wide range
of unit trusts, where funds can eventually be rationalised.
Societe Generale, one of France's largest banks, bought Touche Remnant in
1989 for Pounds 50m, intending to use it as a base from which to expand into
the UK unit trust market. In the late 1980s a number of European banks
bought UK fund management expertise.
Equity markets, however, have performed poorly since 1989 and the value of
Touche Remnant's funds under management has shrunk from Pounds 2.9bn at the
time of the acquisition to Pounds 2bn last year.
The French bank said it had decided that Touche Remnant no longer had the
necessary critical mass needed in fund management.
No price has yet been agreed for the deal.

FT  14 OCT 92 / AWD bought by defence company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AWD, THE former Bedford trucks business that went into receivership in June,
has been sold for an undisclosed sum to a subsidiary of Marshall of
Cambridge, the privately owned UK aerospace and defence support services
contractor.
The purchase will almost certainly mark the end of truck making at AWD's
Dunstable plant after more than 50 years - but it also means that the long
Bedford tradition as a manufacturer of both military and civilian trucks is
likely to be preserved and strengthened.
AWD's product designs and most of its assets are being transferred to
Marshall SPV (special production vehicles).
Originally established as Marshall of Cambridge (Engineering) to make
vehicle bodies and exploit the international market for specialist military
vehicles such as field ambulances, it changed its name to Marshall SPV
earlier this year. It has been seeking to extend its activities in the
civilian vehicles field and its product range now includes refuse disposal
vehicles, single-decker buses, and car transporters and trailers. Recently,
it also acquired Carlisle, the Birmingham-based bus maker.
Marshall, a reticent company that prefers to conduct its affairs out of the
public spotlight, employs 2,500 people - mostly at its sprawling
airfield-based headquarters near Cambridge.
Under its purchase agreement with Mr Tony Thompson and Mr Roger Oldfield of
KPMG Peat Marwick, the joint receivers, Marshall is buying AWD's product
designs, global spare parts business, order book and the rights to the AWD
and Bedford names.
It is taking a short lease on the 45-acre Dunstable plant, where the
receivers have been employing 150 former AWD workers to build about five
trucks a week.
AWD had stopped making trucks for several months before the receivers moved
in. 'However, we wanted to sell AWD as a going concern, got some orders
ourselves - mostly from the military and overseas - and were able to restart
production,' Mr Thompson said yesterday. Marshall is to employ some of the
Dunstable workers on a temporary basis, but is expected to move production
to its Cambridge site in the longer term.
Commenting on the takeover, Mr Bernard Williams, managing director of SPV,
said: 'In AWD we have acquired products with a tremendous reputation in the
specialist market for four-wheel-drive trucks. We believe that there is
synergy between the AWD products and Marshall SPV which will prove of great
benefit to us with our plans for further expansion in civil and military
markets worldwide.'
AWD, then named Bedford Trucks, was bought from General Motors in 1987 for
about Pounds 20m by Mr David Brown, a Yorkshire entrepreneur.
Under GM's ownership, Bedford had been losing Pounds  1/2 m a week in a
plant that had the capacity to produce 60,000 trucks a year and which, up to
the start of the 1980s, had employed 6,000 people.
At its peak under Mr Brown's ownership AWD was employing more than 1,300,
and he spoke of creating a company employing more than 2,000 people and
building 10,000 trucks annually.

Rumours that Lord Gowrie's days as chairman of Sotheby's non-American
operations are numbered are doing the rounds again - a product of the
enduring cultural chasm between the establishment figures who dominate the
London saleroom and Sotheby's president Alfred Taubman, the US shopping mall
tycoon, who bought the company to please his wife.
The arrival last October of former Hollywood producer Roger Faxon as a
cost-cutting managing director in London left Lord Gowrie concentrating his
talents on selling Sotheby's to the rich and famous and using his contacts
to acquire goods for sale in competition with the sharpened-up Christie's.
But now the promotional job has disappeared as well with the arrival of Luke
Rittner, former boss of the Arts Council, as head of corporate affairs. Lord
Gowrie is still a great asset at Sotheby's - which he joined in 1987 after
quitting the government because he could not live on his ministerial salary
 -and the London operation has withstood the recession better than the New
York end.
On the other side of the Atlantic, the whispers concentrate on Taubman. He
is believed to be wearying of the social whirl that comes with owning the
world's biggest auction house. More to the point he has been raising cash
this year and there is even talk that he may depart before Gowrie.

Tomorrow will be better - Prospects for the stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEAN-FRANCOIS Theodore is a confident man. The president of the Societe des
Bourses Francaises leans back in one of the black leather chairs in his rue
Cambon office and oozes optimism about the prospects for the French stock
market.
'Everything is in place,' he says. 'The necessary reforms have been made. We
have one of the world's most sophisticated computer systems. There is
legislation in the pipeline - privatisation and pension reform - which will
bring more business to the market and we're ready for it.'
The same confidence is voiced by almost everyone associated with the French
stock markets. All are convinced that, over the long term, the gradual
privatisation of France's big state-controlled companies, coupled with the
creation of a new breed of private pension funds, will stimulate the
investment sector.
This rosy scenario is rather different from the present picture. In the
1980s the French stock markets underwent a period of radical reform in an
attempt to prepare them for life in the intensely competitive markets of the
1990s.
The reforms may have succeeded in modernising the mechanics of the Paris
markets. They also created the successful MATIF futures market which is now
one of the largest worldwide. But many of the stock markets' traditional
problems persist. The new rules on block trading, transactions in large
amounts of shares, are so tight that Paris has continued to lose business to
London. Moreover Paris still suffers from its old problem of poor liquidity.
The French government's influence over industry, which means that 20 per
cent of output comes from state-controlled companies, has created a dearth
of equity. This problem has been aggravated by the anachronistic ownership
structure of France's private sector companies, where large chunks of stock
are held by friendly banks and 'sweetheart' shareholders.
The state's stranglehold over the pension system means that pension funds
represent just 10 per cent of the Paris stock market, compared with 60 per
cent in London, thereby creating a shortage of investment.
This lack of liquidity has also contributed to the financial problems of the
Paris stockbrokers. The 55 French broking firms made collective losses of
FFr600m in 1991, according to the Association Francaise des Societes de la
Bourse, a slight improvement on their combined deficit of FFr666m in 1990.
This scenario has already catalysed a rash of cost cutting. There were 480
job losses across French broking last year, according to the AFSB, with the
workforce shrinking from 5,340 to 4,860. Most practitioners maintain that
there are still too many companies chasing too little business.
Mr Theodore is convinced that the industry has reached the bottom of the
cycle and that conditions can now only improve. 'It's just not true that
there are too many players on the Paris market,' he said. 'There are 45
stockbrokers in Paris and 580 in New York, but the New York market is only
10 times bigger than Paris.'
The global securities groups seem to agree. In recent months a number of
international names have opened or extended their banking or broking
operations in Paris, including Kleinwort Benson and Baring Brothers of the
UK, Morgan Stanley of the US and Japan's Nomura.
These companies are pinning their hopes on the long-term prospects for the
Paris market. One reason for their confidence is the sustained support of
France's socialist government. Throughout the 1980s the government,
spearheaded by Mr Beregovoy, squashed every stereotype about socialist
opposition to the investment sector by championing the modernisation of the
Paris markets.
One of the few areas where the government has not been as supportive as the
brokers wished is in its failure to abolish the bourse tax on share
transactions which, they claim, puts them at a major disadvantage to London,
particularly for large transactions. The proposed reform of the rules on
block trading has been put on ice until its abolition.
However, the markets are really much more interested in the prospect of
privatisation and pension reform which, they believe, will also accelerate
after the elections, whichever political party wins.
'The Paris stock market has already made a lot of progress,' says Mr Jean
Saint-Geours, president of the Commission des Operations de Bourse. 'It is
not as international as London, but it has the potential to become one of
the main European markets as part of a network with Frankfurt, Milan and
Madrid.'

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - France (9): Lure
of the City - French banks in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK DE JACQUELOT, London correspondent, Les Echos
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRUGGLING in the recession but still determined to be significant players,
France's big banks are having another difficult year in the City of London.
The French are busily reducing staff and cutting costs in their UK
subsidiaries, which are often at the heart of the international operations.
Having increased their London presence on a grand scale in the 1980s, French
banks now share the predicament of the rest of the British financial sector.
If most think 1992 will not be too bad, it is only by comparison with
previous years.
The French were hard hit by corporate collapses such as British &amp;
Commonwealth, Polly Peck and Brent Walker. Last year, the Maxwell saga
proved expensive for Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit
Agricole and Societe Generale. French banks came second only to the British
in the list of Maxwell lenders.
So far, 1992 has been quieter, but that does not mean results will be much
better at the end of the year. 'Twelve months ago we believed that all the
firms which would collapse had already done so,' says one French banker in
London. 'We were wrong. Some companies that were relatively strong in 1991
are now far weaker.'
One problem is the precarious state of the property market. Credit Lyonnais,
for one, was a heavy lender to Heron and Mountleigh. It was also a big
creditor of Olympia &amp; York, the stricken Canadian property group behind the
Canary Wharf development, but this business was not booked in London. In the
leisure industry, Mowat's demise hit Banque Indosuez.
Some French banks such as BNP, Paribas and Societe Generale expect to make a
profit, albeit a modest one, in 1992. Others, like Credit Lyonnais, say they
will still be in the red.
Unsurprisingly, the banks are now emphasising rigorous management. The days
of generous lending are over. 'We do not want to develop relationships with
customers based only on credit,' says Mr Denis Antoine, head of Paribas in
London. 'It must be part of a broader package, together with other financial
products such as swaps.'
Management rigour often implies cost-cutting. BNP will employ 300 people in
the UK by the end of the year, down from 350 a year ago and from 460 four
years previously. Indosuez now has 205 staff, against 330 three years ago.
Another common characteristic of rationalisation is a move towards better
co-ordination between the banks' traditional branches and their financial
market subsidiaries. Banque Paribas and Paribas Capital Markets will be
housed under the same roof by December. At Societe Generale, Mr Patrick
Pagni, the new chief executive of the branch, was previously in charge of
the brokerage subsidiary, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
Trying to make the most of huge bad debts is viewed as important. 'This
group has to take an active role in creditors' committees, saying 'We want
our money back,' just like Margaret Thatcher with the European Community,'
says Mr Olivier Mas, chief executive of Credit Lyonnais in London.
The scenario is not entirely gloomy. Most French bankers in London are
trying to invest and develop some activities. Many, such as BNP, put the
emphasis on what they see as the strongest market in the City of London:
treasury and foreign exchange operations.
Similarly, Societe Generale wants to focus on large and medium-sized
companies with international operations.
Paribas wants to develop its corporate UK client base. 'Until recently we
were using London as an international financial centre and neglecting the
domestic side,' says Mr Denis Antoine. 'We would like now to be seen more as
a British bank.'
Credit Lyonnais is more ambitious than its compatriots. In the past two
years it has opened 10 branches throughout Britain, aimed at middle-size
companies, and more are to come. 'The next step is retail banking,' says Mr
Mas. 'We would need several dozen branches by 1995.'
The only French bank in Britain with an expanding staff, Credit Lyonnais
employed 420 in 1990 and has 500 staff today, with 550 forecast for the end
of next year.
Yet other French banks are emerging in London. Credit Locale de France has
joined forces with Municipal Mutual. Credit Commercial de France is said to
be looking at Charterhouse, the merchant bank put up for sale by Royal Bank
of Scotland. Next year BNP may raise its 4.5 per cent stake in Kleinwort
Benson, in association with Dresdner Bank.
For all its present difficulties, the City of London is still a place where
France's big banks feel they ought to be.

MITSUBISHI of Japan and Daimler-Benz, the German industrial group, yesterday
reconfirmed their growing co-operation, after talks at the weekend in Japan
between their executives.
Mr Takeshi Eguchi, vice-president of Mitsubishi Corp, the trading company
that is the nucleus of the group, said the mutual understanding between the
two groups had been strengthened.
Mr Eguchi added that of the several projects being studied, an important
agreement between the two companies may be concluded by the end of this
year.
The weekend meeting is the fourth since the highly publicised decision in
1990 between Daimler-Benz and four companies in the Mitsubishi group to seek
a broad strategic alliance.
However, in contrast to the initial excitement over the tie-up, Mitsubishi
underplayed the importance of the alliance. So far, the groups have failed
to come up with any significant deals.
Mitsubishi Motors and Mercedes-Benz are discussing deal under which
Mitsubishi will supply the German vehicle group with diesel engines for
light trucks.
An earlier agreement under which Mitsubishi dealers in Japan sell
Mercedes-Benz cars, has run into difficulties as the German company wants to
develop an independent dealer network.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Maxus Energy, a Texas oil company, rose in New York yesterday on
the news that Kidder, Peabody, the Wall Street investment bank, had agreed
over the weekend to pay Maxus Dollars 165m to settle an insider-trading
lawsuit that was due to go to trial later this week.
The lawsuit was originally filed in 1987. It alleged that insider trading by
Mr Martin Siegel, a former senior executive at Kidder, and Mr Ivan Boesky,
the disgraced arbitrageur who was imprisoned for insider trading in 1988,
forced Maxus' predecessor company, Diamond Shamrock, to pay too much in its
1983 takeover of Natomas, a San Francisco based energy company.
According to Maxus, Mr Boesky used confidential information supplied by Mr
Siegel, who at the time was acting as Kidder's adviser to Diamond Shamrock,
to force up the price of Natomas just before Diamond Shamrock paid Dollars
1.27bn for the company.
Under the agreement, which was concluded just three days before jury
selection for the trial began, Kidder will pay Maxus Dollars 125m in cash,
plus Dollars 40m in exchange for five-year warrants to buy 8m Maxus shares
at Dollars 13 each.
Both sides said they settled the lawsuit to avoid the cost and time of
litigation.
News of the settlement pleased Maxus investors, who bid up the stock Dollars
 1/4 to Dollars 7 1/4 .
The share price of General Electric, Kidder's parent, rose Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 75 3/8 .
Kidder said the payment to Maxus would have no material impact on its
business because the firm had already set aside reserves relating to the
matter.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VEBA, the German conglom- erate, is to become the largest shareholder in
Sydkraft, one of Sweden's leading power generation companies, in the biggest
privatisation yet in Sweden.
Preussen Elektra, a Veba subsidiary, is to pay SKr1.07bn (Dollars 197m) for
part of the voting and non-voting shares owned by the council for
Helsingborg, a large town on the south-west coast of Sweden.
Veba's expansion is one of the first examples of the increasing likelihood
of higher levels of foreign ownership in Swedish industry.
The removal of the final legal restrictions to foreign ownership of any part
of a Swedish company, which was in place for over 50 years, took place
earlier this year.
Last year, the German company purchased 10.5 per cent of the equity but only
1.7 per cent of the voting shares in the Swedish power company.
Under the proposed deal, Helsingborg council is issuing a bond to Preussen
Electra which gives the company the right to take over its stake in Sydkraft
on January 1 1995 when the existing consortium agreement of southern Swedish
local authorities in Sydkraft comes to an end.
As a result of the agreement, the German company will acquire Helsingborg
council's 6.2 per cent equity and 9.9 per cent voting rights in Sydkraft.
This will make Preussen Elektra the largest shareholder in the company and
the second-biggest owner of voting rights in Sydkraft after Malmo city
council.
The Helsingborg council said that the deal would provide it with a profit of
about SKr1bn.
'Both from an ideological and economic point of view the deal is a very
great success', said Mr Jerker Swanstein, head of the council.
'A local authority should not own assets which can be owned by the private
sector. The need for direct ownership is less important in a liberalised
electricity market.'
This is the first example of a local authority in Sweden privatising its
stake in a utility. But over the next few years other local authorities are
expected to follow the latest move in order to raise resources at a time of
financial stringency.
The deal with Veba shows that the privatisation programme in Sweden has not
lost momentum, in spite of the moratorium agreed two weeks ago at national
level between the Swedish government and the Social Democratic opposition on
the sale of Sweden's state-owned enterprises.
As a result of the sale Helsingborgs will cut its current loan debts, said
Mr Swanstein. At present, Helsingborg council is controlled by a coalition
of non-Socialist parties, but in a statement it said that the Social
Demo-cratic opposition also supported the deal with Preussen Elektra.
Mr Goran Ahlstrom, chief executive of Sydkraft, said he knew nothing about
the deal.
While the news agencies had been informed, he had not.

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA) would not try to exert close management control
over Qantas - the Australian international carrier which the government is
planning to privatise - if it succeeded in taking a 20 per cent holding, Mr
J Y Pillay, SIA's chairman, said yesterday.
In a warning to Canberra over the future independence of Qantas, he
contrasted this promise with British Airways' apparent plans to direct the
activities of USAir, in which it proposes to acquire a 44 per cent stake for
Dollars 750m .
The UK carrier has, however, denied such plans, describing its proposed
USAir investment as a partnership.
BA - which has also expressed interest in buying a stake in Qantas - would
have a veto of USAir board decisions in spite of only having a minority
shareholding. 'We do not want a BA/USAir-type deal,' said Mr Pillay.
Canberra is particularly sensitive to accusations of giving up control of
the national airline before elections next year.
A significant interest in Qantas would help BA fulfil its plan to build a
global airline. Earlier this year, Lord King, BA chairman, said the airline
needed a stronger presence in the Asia Pacific market.
Mr Pillay said SIA wanted board representation only in proportion to its
stake, but that details had yet to be worked out.
The link would reinforce SIA's position in the Pacific region. Mr Pillay
admitted that its ties with Delta, the US carrier with which it has a 5 per
cent crossholding, 'could be a lot better'.
Delta has been 'pre-occupied' with dealing with its heavily loss-making
routes especially in the highly competitive domestic US market.

MAYBANK, Malaysia's biggest banking group, has reported taxable profits of
MDollars 560m (USDollars 223.3m) for the year to June, a rise of 26.1 per
cent on the previous year's figure.
Maybank's commercial and merchant banking activities accounted for MDollars
472m of the 1992 profits.
Finance and leasing operations contributed MDollars 72m, with other
activities contributing the remainder.
Maybank has concentrated on its home market and therefore benefited from the
rapid growth of the Malaysian economy over the past four years. More than 80
per cent of the group's taxable profits came from its operations in
Malaysia, while about 12 per cent came from activities in Singapore.
Maybank also has operations in Brunei, Hong Kong, London and New York.
Mr Ahmad Mohamed Don, managing director, said growth prospects for the bank
continued to be favourable given the continued growth of the Malaysian
economy. In each of the last four years, Malaysia's economy has grown by
more than 8 per cent. The latest estimates are for growth of 8.7 per cent
this year.
Mr Ahmad also announced that Maybank had acquired a life insurance licence
through the MDollars 15m purchase of Safety Life &amp; General Insurance.
The life insurance business in Malaysia is considered to be underdeveloped,
and Mr Ahmad said the sector had the potential for long-term growth.
According to Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, the number of new life
insurance policies rose by 25 per cent in 1991.

constitutional talks with the ANC and other parties, including Inkatha which
suspended talks with the government two weeks ago.
He lashed out, however, at the ANC shortly after thousands of its protesters
surrounded the parliament building, demanding that it scale down its
campaign of mass action which he blames for exacerbating political violence.
The ANC demonstration, called to protest at continued exclusion of blacks
from parliament and at government plans to amnesty police and army officers,
was much smaller than expected, with only about 5,000 people taking part.
Organisers had expected 25,000.
South African Communist party veteran Joe Slovo addressed the crowd. 'We
want this place closed down and replaced by a people's parliament. The
people have no vote here. The only parliament you can participate in is the
parliament of the streets,' he said.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Ex-securities chief faces fraud trial: Spotlight on illegal
share dealings in Johannesburg

<TEXT>
THE extent of illegal share dealings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
(JSE) comes under the spotlight today in the Rand Supreme Court with the
start of one of the most widely publicised securities cases in years.
Mr Greg Blank, then a director of one of the largest firms on the JSE,
Frankel Max Pollak Vinderine (Frankels), is being charged with 49 counts of
fraud, allegedly involving an illegal gain of about R10m (Pounds 2m). There
is no precedent in South Africa for a JSE member being charged for irregular
dealings on such a large scale.
Lack of convictions for securities offences in the past has led to
speculation , fiercely denied by the JSE authorities, that illegal trading
is widespread.
They will be hoping that, should Mr Blank be found guilty, a stiff sentence
will be handed down which will help dispel suspicions about the JSE,
justified or not.
Mr Blank's conspicuously wealthy lifestyle has also focused attention on the
case, as has the fact that his alleged accomplices occupied senior positions
at the Old Mutual, South Africa's largest insurance company. Mr Blank was
the person responsible for Old Mutual's dealings with Frankels.
The bulk of the charges relate to the practice known as 'front-running'. It
is alleged that, between 1989 and 1991, Mr Blank, in collaboration with his
three accomplices at the Old Mutual - two portfolio managers and the chief
trader - bought numerous lines of stock for the account of a company in
which they were joint beneficiaries.
Once a sufficient quantity of the particular share had been accumulated, and
the share had reached a particular price, it would be sold to the Old
Mutual, normally within two to four weeks.

   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR FW de Klerk, the South African president, said yesterday that government
officials would meet the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party within a
fortnight, removing one of the most serious obstacles to the resumption of
multi-party talks on a new constitution.
Delivering a 'state of the nation' address to a special session of
parliament in Cape Town, he stressed his determination to proceed with
constitutional negotiations with the ANC and other parties, including
Inkatha which suspended talks with the government two weeks ago.
He lashed out, however, at the African National Congress shortly after
thousands of ANC protesters surrounded the parliament building. He demanded
that the organisation scale down its campaign of mass action which he blames
for exacerbating political violence in South Africa.
The ANC demonstration, called to protest at the continued exclusion of
blacks from parliament and at government plans to amnesty police and army
officers, was much smaller than expected. Only about 5,000 people took part.
Organisers had expected a crowd of 25,000.
Top ANC leaders addressed the crowd, which formed a human chain around the
parliament building. 'We want this place closed down and replaced by a
people's parliament,' South African Communist party veteran Joe Slovo
demanded. 'The people have no vote here. The only parliament you can
participate in is the parliament of the streets,' he said.
ANC leaders condemned government plans to introduce legislation in
parliament within the next 10 days to amnesty security force officers who
committed crimes under apartheid.
Mr de Klerk outlined principles on which he demanded agreement before an
interim constitution could be agreed, including devolution of power to
regional and local governments, multi-party power sharing at the executive
level of government, and a bicameral legislature to protect special
interests. The ANC and government positions on all of these issues remain
sharply at odds.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Antiques trade association launches code of practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE antiques industry has launched a code of practice in an attempt to
improve consumer confidence in a sector where some dealers have gained a
reputation for sharp practice.
The London and Provincial Antique Dealers' Association, which has 700
members throughout the UK, has drawn up an Antique Buyers' Charter,
outlining dealers' responsibilities and shoppers' rights.
It has been approved by the Office of Fair Trading.
Shoppers will be able to take complaints to the association, which will
consult antiques experts for arbitration, scrutinised by an independent
adjudicator. Statutory legal rights will not be affected by the process.
Lord Derwent, association chairman, said: 'Antiques is an unusual business
in that it relies on expert opinions which sometimes genuinely differ. If
you buy a refrigerator and it does not work that it is pretty clear-cut. But
what happens if you buy some Meissen and do not believe it is Meissen?'
Member companies will display the charter in their shops and give detailed
information about an article's price, date of manufacture, material and
maker's name, and state whether it has been subject to restoration or
reproduction.
Members found to have broken the code will be required to resign.
The number of antique dealers in the UK is not known but the association
estimates that it represents about a quarter of the industry.
Shoppers' charters are becoming increasingly common in service industries -
the Office of Fair Trading is working with about 30 trade associations to
draw up codes.

FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Algerians sign gas deal with Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SONATRACH, Algeria's state oil and gas monopoly, has signed a 20-year
contract with the Italian state electricity company ENEL whereby Sonatrach
will deliver 4bn cubic metres of gas a year starting in 1995. The gas will
go through the trans-Mediterranean pipeline which takes gas to the Italian
mainland through Tunisia and the Straits of Sicily, and whose capacity is
being doubled.
The contract means Sonatrach will more than double its exports to Italy by
the year 2000, to 30bn cubic metres a year. Mr Franco Viezzoli, president of
ENEL, has signalled his company's wish to start immediate talks on doubling
the amount it has contracted to buy. Gas now accounts for about 19 per cent
of Italy's electricity, a figure set to rise 50 per cent by the year 2000.
The contract with ENEL underlines the advantages for Sonatrach of the more
flexible oil and gas policy adopted by Algeria since 1988. Selling gas for
electricity generation is a competitive business if compared with the more
rigid liquefied natural gas trade.
Sonatrach hopes to double its gas output over the next few years as demand
abroad has outstripped the company's capacity to deliver. Mr Hacen Mufti,
Algeria's energy minister, has indicated Algeria will allow oil companies
negotiating for enhanced oilfield recovery schemes the option of acquiring
equity sharing in some oilfields.
Premier Belaid Abdesselam appears to attach less importance than his
predecessor, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, to getting large front-end cash bonuses
from companies sharing in such schemes, preferring to stress the importance
of developing proper technical models to develop the fields.

FT  13 OCT 92 / A changing Dr Jagan in a changing world: Guyana's president
with a past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Dr Cheddi Jagan, the new president of Guyana, joins his colleagues at a
Caribbean Community summit in Trinidad in a fortnight, they will all be more
than slightly anxious to discard some mutual reservations.
Over the past three years Dr Jagan had repeatedly prevailed on his Caricom
colleagues to help correct what were widely held to be repeated
irregularities in the process leading to elections in Guyana and which Dr
Jagan claimed had kept the People's National Congress party of Mr Desmond
Hoyte in office. Dr Jagan wanted Caricom to send a team of observers to
monitor the elections.
The Caricom leaders were, largely, unmoved by Dr Jagan's appeals and did not
send a mission to Guyana. In the event the Caricom presence at the elections
was contained in a Commonwealth team. This, said functionaries of Dr Jagan's
People's Progressive party, was because no Caricom leader wanted to upset Mr
Hoyte. 'Despite this, I will not hold it against the Caricom governments,'
said Dr Jagan.
Dr Jagan, a 74-year-old dentist and a former premier of Guyana, has said,
rather, that strengthening ties with Guyana's colleagues in the Caribbean
will be a foreign policy priority of his new government. Whatever
reservations the Caricom members had about monitoring the elections, the new
president will be welcomed by his colleagues.
Dr Jagan, once an avowed Marxist, has been a victim of the ideological sea
change which has overtaken many third world leaders over the past decade.
However, his move towards moderation and his recent advocacy of a market
economy have allayed concerns, held until recently by some of the more
conservative Caricom leaders, that Dr Jagan was a closet communist.
The new president will also do well in mending fences with the US, which he
describes as one of Guyana's 'traditional friends'. In the administration of
Mr Forbes Burnham, Mr Hoyte's predecessor in office, Washington found itself
not easily able to decide who might be a better friend.
Mr Burnham's state capitalism, in the pursuit of 'co-operative socialism',
including the nationalisation of foreign property, was the alternative to Dr
Jagan's Marxism in the days of the cold war. Mr Hoyte's volte face in
economic policy in deregulating the economy and distancing himself from the
economic and political excesses of Mr Burnham apparently only strengthened
the appeal of the reformed Dr Jagan.
The Hoyte administration's revised policies were part of a structural
adjustment programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank. Dr Jagan, in opposition, had attacked the government for
implementing the programme, arguing that the measures were too harsh.
The PPP now says that it will try to modify the IMF pact. 'We feel confident
that the IMF can be persuaded to renegotiate the harsh conditions which have
been imposed on the weak PNC administration,' the party said.
In taking over the government of the English-speaking republic of 900,000
people located on the north-east shoulder of South America, Dr Jagan faces
several formidable challenges. The first is that he is in danger of being an
anachronism. Dr Jagan last held political office 28 years ago, and since
then has had to lead parliamentary opposition to the PNC. Much has changed
in the world since, and old habits die hard.
The new president still speaks of his desire to act on behalf of the
'working people', and an apparent objection to the sell-off of state
enterprises and the involvement of foreign investors has had to be reversed
and clarified by his advisers in the face of questions raised by foreign
business.
Another challenge facing Dr Jagan is the economy, which is based on sugar
and rice production and bauxite and gold mining. In breaking the mould of
state capitalism and in deregulating the economy, Mr Hoyte took the hard
decisions. But the price paid by Guyanese has been high. A 64 per cent
depreciation which followed the floating of the currency last year
contributed to high inflation and reduced the standard of living of most
Guyanese and led to increased emigration.
Foreign investors have looked favourably on Guyana. But Dr Jagan will need
to encourage many more with significant amounts of money to rebuild the
economy, which had been declining steadily until last year when it expanded
by 6 per cent before growing by twice that rate in the first half of this
year.
Guyanese voted largely along ethnic lines, with the PPP being supported by
those of Indian origin, about 52 per cent of the population, and the PNC by
those of African descent, about 38 per cent.
Dr Jagan has promised to work to end racial divisions, to begin with by
appointing a multi-ethnic cabinet.
Dr Cheddi Jagan, who was sworn in at the weekend as president of Guyana, is
seeking the assistance of two small political parties, as his victorious
People's Progressive party (PPP) has only a one-seat majority in the
assembly, writes Canute James.
Dr Jagan said he would ask the Working People's Alliance and the United
Force if they were interested in a coalition. The left-of centre WPA and the
conservative UF trailed the PPP and the former ruling People's National
Congress (PNC) in elections last week. Mr Jagan said he would not be seeking
PNC support.
PPP officials said the most likely partner for the party was the WPA whose
presidential candidate, Mr Clive Thomas, could be given a senior cabinet
post.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Engineering groups condemn ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE jobs shake-out in British manufacturing continued yesterday as
engineering employers accused the government of 'ministerial paralysis' in
failing to enact policies for lasting economic recovery.
Lucas Industries, one of the UK's largest engineering groups, meanwhile
announced it was shedding at least 4,000 jobs - more than half of them
outside Britain - over the next three years as part of a restructuring
programme.
The company has already announced the closure of eight sites - none of them
in the UK - and says a similar number of factories in unspecified locations
are also likely to shut.
Lucas's restructuring takes place against a background of depressed
automotive and aerospace markets, which the company says show only faint
signs of revival.
Its announcement coincided with the results of a survey which showed that
500 UK manufacturing sites have closed in the past year, taking with them
another 47,000 jobs.
There was harsh criticism from the Engineering Employers' Federation over
the government's handling of the economy. It accused the Treasury and the
Department of Trade and Industry of not supporting manufacturing industry
and failing to introduce an industrial strategy for stimulating
manufacturing investment and boosting public spending on infrastructure.
Mr Neil Johnson, the federation's director-general, said engineering skills
were going to waste in the recession, threatening Britain's longer-term
ability to compete. He said the 'vibrant core' of British engineering had
not yet been dismantled but he attacked the government for having no clear
vision about how to achieve economic recovery.
He added: 'A policy of waiting for something to turn up is demonstrably not
going to provide the sort of positive results industry has the right to
expect.'
The federation said the recession in engineering - which has cut total
output by 13 per cent since 1989 and left more than 300,000 people
unemployed - has bottomed out, six months later than first forecast. But it
warned that a further 55,000 engineering jobs could still be lost in the
next year.
Engineering output in 1992 will have fallen, according to the federation, by
more than 3 per cent on 1991. It is expected to increase by nearly 3 per
cent in 1993, almost entirely because of a projected 10 per cent increase in
motor vehicle output.
The survey of manufacturing sites by Remploy, which provides skilled workers
under contract to manufacturing companies, says factories and jobs have
continued to decline as companies have pursued closures and mergers to
combat the recession. London has been worst hit, followed by south-west
England.
Another survey painted a gloomy picture for manufacturing prospects in the
north-west. Chambers of commerce in the region report a slump in confidence
as new orders have continued to nosedive, wiping out the more optimistic
picture reported earlier in the year.

Brent Chemicals International is acquiring certain assets and the business
of Chemical Systems of the US for a total of Dollars 5.3m (Pounds 3m).
If certain conditions can be met Brent will also acquire the assets and

Dollars 850,000.
Sales of Chemsys in the 1991 year were Dollars 3.9m. Adjusting the pre-tax
figures to reflect the change of structure under Brent's ownership would
have shown profits of Dollars 900,000.
Net assets at the end of the year were Dollars 600,000.
Brent is paying Dollars 1.8m for the assets and business with a further
Dollars 3.5m under a sub-contract manufacturing agreement with Chemsys and
non-compete and consultancy agreements with the joint owners of Chemsys.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Adam board comfortably survives meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN and board of Adam &amp; Company, the small Edinburgh-based private
banking group, whose banking subsidiary lost twice its capital in irregular
foreign exchange futures dealing, yesterday comfortably survived an
extraordinary general meeting held to consider the affair.
There was no call at the meeting for the resignation of either Sir Charles
Fraser, chairman, or of Mr James Laurenson, deputy chairman and managing
director, and two shareholders asked for the opportunity to put more money
into the bank.
Sir Charles, a leading Edinburgh solicitor and company director, told
shareholders that if the senior executives and directors who were
'technically responsible' for the loss were to resign, 'you would have no
Adam &amp; Co.' The company was too small to sustain the departure of its top
executives.
But he said: 'I apologise unreservedly to shareholders for what has
happened. An expression of remorse is entirely appropriate.'
Adam &amp; Co, a bank which caters for wealthy individual clients, suffered a
loss of Pounds 21m in its London treasury department due to operations by
its foreign exchange dealers who 'acted as a rather inexperienced gambler at
a roulette table,' he said.
Although the loss wiped out the bank's Pounds 10m capital, Adam &amp; Co was
rescued by Mrs Francoise Schlumberger Primat, a 75-year-old director, who
agreed immediately to inject Pounds 21m into the bank by means of an issue
of perpetual convertible non-cumulative preference shares which carry no
coupon till 2003.
The Schlumberger family of France, whose fortune is founded on its company
which operates systems for measuring the flow of oil wells, was already the
largest shareholder in Adam &amp; Co, following Adam's acquisition of
Continental Trust in 1986.
Adam &amp; Co - then the first new Scottish bank since 1844 - was created in
1984 by Scottish private and institutional investors and named after the
economist Adam Smith.
Sir Charles told about 120 shareholders in a sober and attentive gathering
at the Caledonian Hotel in Edinburgh that the loss occurred in a
discretionary currency portfolio set up for a client and came to light on
August 26 when the two dealers involved disclosed the situation.
Losses were incurred, he said, 'at an early stage in the management of the
portfolio.' But the dealers were 'extremely nervous about reporting such
losses' and believed they could avoid doing so by 'rolling contracts forward
in the expectation of a reversal of the trends which had created the
losses.'
Because of the accounting techniques employed by the dealers neither the
client nor the senior managers or directors of the bank were ever aware of
the extent of the overall exposure. The quarterly reports 'on almost all
occasions indicated that there were no outstanding forward contracts at the
reporting date. This we now know to be totally untrue.'
The dealers were backing the US dollar against the D-mark at a time when the
US currency was falling steadily. 'The dealers acted as a rather
inexperienced gambler at a roulette table and continued to bet on the same
outcome, backing the dollar against the deutschemark and doubling up as the
situation became more desperate.'
Some 22 outstanding rolled-over positions were concealed. Fictitious deals
were also booked to the portfolio account and, according to a specially
commissioned report by Price Waterhouse, the dealers had 'thought of
everything, even to the extent of selecting counterparties which they
thought would not be approached by the auditors.'
The two dealers, Peter Wood, 31, and Richard Turnbull, 27, were immediately
suspended and are now no longer employed by the bank, Sir Charles said.
The chairman said that such 'operations can only be carried out by
knowledgeable dealers who are prepared to manipulate the bank's reporting
systems in order to avoid detection.' The control over the management of the
discretionary portfolio was 'clearly not adequate.'
Sir Charles said that Adam &amp; Co had decided to stop operating discretionary
foreign exchanges portfolios and close its London foreign exchange dealing
room, retain only the one in Edinburgh.
Price Waterhouse is now finalising its 'forensic' report on the affair and
how it escaped detection which will be sent to the Bank of England.
The chairman said that fewer than 20 client relationships had been
terminated because of the affair and the bank, which is a subsidiary of Adam
&amp; Company Group, now has net assets of Pounds 12.2m. A major clearing bank
had confirmed the validity of Adam &amp; Co's controls and highlighted areas
where they might be strengthened.
Until the deficit on reserves of Pounds 18.8m has been eliminated
shareholders cannot receive dividends from the bank, which made a profit of
Pounds 1.2m before the exceptional loss. The bank is therefore considering a
scheme, which would require court approval, to eliminate the deficit on
reserves by reducing the nominal value of the share capital of the bank.
Although some shareholders raised critical points at the hour-long EGM, one
shareholder, Mr Jimmy Walker, a fund manager, quoted Henry Ford's words:
'History is bunk.' Adam &amp; Co must look to the future and give its
shareholders the chance of subscribing new capital through a one for one
rights issue.

FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Outokumpu in FM62m loss for
first eight months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, made a FM62m (Dollars 13.2m)
loss in the first eight months, reflecting lower-than-expected metal prices
and a weak dollar.
The result was considerably better than the FM255m loss recorded in the same
period last year, but the recovery has been slower than expected because of
reduced investment activity in the group's European and US markets. In the
first four months, the group made a FM3m profit.
Sales in the last eight months rose 1.5 per cent to FM8.147bn from
FM8.029bn.
Outokumpu said profitability had improved considerably compared with last
year. It highlighted the November 1991 devaluation of the markka, growth in
stainless steel sales, and the implementation of efficiency measures as
positive factors.
The group said both its copper products and technology divisions continued
to make losses, while stainless steel and base metals recorded positive
results.
Outokumpu said Finland's decision last month to float the markka would
worsen its 1992 result by FM50m, assuming a 15 per cent devaluation. It also
said its decision to close down Outokumpu Copper Kenosha's drawn products
line in the US would lead to FM130m in write-offs and expenses.
However, the company says its 1992 result is expected to 'improve
significantly' on last year's FM768m loss, although it will stay in the red.
AMER, the Finnish consumer products group, reported a first-half pre-tax
profit of FM40m (Dollars 8.52m), compared with a break-even result in the
same period last year.
The improvement for the six months to August 31 came despite a 5 per cent
fall in net sales to FM3.33bn. The group blamed the drop on a continued
decline in the Finnish car market and reduced demand for wholesale paper
deliveries.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (9): Livening up the
picture - Olivetti transfers the videophone from science-fiction to reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE operators of two personal computers will exchange data between Pisa and
London today. The information will be flashed across Europe using Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN) telecoms standards.
There's nothing unusual about that. What merits a public demonstration at
Wembley's Interactive Multi-Media Event is that video cameras fixed to each
monitor will transmit a live video image of either user.
The picture forms one frame of a split screen using windowing software.
Other windows will contain still images that can be modified by one party as
the other looks on. A telephone handset completes the communications
package.
The Personal Communication Computer (PCC) is the result of collaboration
between British Telecom and Olivetti multi-media research labs in Pisa.
It marks the transition of the videophone from science-fiction gimmick to
working tool, and owes its existence to the maturing of international
communications standards.
Mr Chris Hart is a BT manager for architecture, technology and standards. He
has watched video communications struggle after a false start. 'The original
BT video experiments were in the '70s, but what came out of them was
teletext. BT had a belief in video telephony then and it bombed.'
Transmitting a moving image digitally was the problem.
That was before ISDN arrived to support the speed of transmission and
provide an internationally agreed standard to carry the data. ISDN has been
fuelled by the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) initiative towards open
standards in computer communications.
Without a widespread data standard the PCC would be an expensive laboratory
toy. A communications computer that would only talk to machines from the one
supplier would not appeal to any sensible user.
With commonly defined standards, BT can launch PCC products with any other
computer maker it choses. An alliance with IBM is already in the works.
The PCC only began to make sense with market acceptance of multi-media, the
technology that ties video, audio text and graphics together in one PC
package. Olivetti used off the shelf products (the video camera is from
Panasonic or Sony) and married them to the PCC. The product owes its
existence to these underpinning technologies.
Not every business application cries out for live video links. Foreign
exchange dealers do not require their trading partner to witness the chaos
of a dealing room. And because ISDN signals still travel over copper wires,
the video rate is slowed down to 10 frames a second, around a third of TV
transfer rates. The result is a slightly jerky picture.
But EC-funded work carried out as part of the Research into Advanced
Communications in Europe (Race) project suggests live video links are more
than an elaborate gimmick.
Prototype PCCs became popular with staff at Allied Irish Bank. The ability
to communicate with a live member of staff is the next step in the use of
multi-media in retailing.
Interactive systems using video disks are currently used to sell financial
services. But they are limited to answering whatever queries the help-screen
has been pre-programmed for.
Sooner or later human intervention is required. One expert at one location
can service several retail outlets via a network of PCCs.
With enhanced versions on the way, Olivetti is proposing to rent out a pair
of PCCs for Pounds 2,000 a month, with imminent upgrades thrown in. Used
imaginatively the ability to redesign plans and documents on-screen over
great distances could offer significant cost benefits.
And the advance of open computer communications has already been seized on
as a force multiplier by the retail banking industry.
Olivetti will deliver 1,000 network controllers to National Westminster Bank
this year. The bank is spending Pounds 20m in the current year to get a
comprehensive dedicated computer communications systems up and running.
These controllers are powerful workstations known as file servers that will
run NatWest retail banking applications in each branch and summon personal
account data via the bank's network. The X25 OSI protocol is the key to
NatWest's plans. Building a network around the open systems model permits
chopping and changing suppliers at will, provided they meet OSI criteria.
Olivetti is prime contractor on the project. It integrates software from the
bank and third parties and ensures that the resulting system will run
happily across a wide area network. This contract comes as recognition of
its status in the open systems world. But that achievement also contains a
threat.
NatWest is buying in Olivetti expertise in creating a broad-ranging network
that will be open to other sources of technology. Doing the job properly and
within cost is the only guarantee Olivetti has of being asked back to
participate next year.
Olivetti was an early and enthusiastic participant in the business of open
communications. Historically it had never invested in its own proprietary
protocol. The pay-off comes with contracts such as the NatWest deal.
But dedication to OSI has its drawbacks. Older, non-open standards still
enjoy a massive user base, especially in the US.
'We were first in when the OSI ball started rolling, but the market hasn't
embraced OSI to the extent planned and Olivetti has invested a huge resource
in it.'
Mr Chris Wilson is group communications manager at Olivetti in the UK. He is
well aware that a religious adherence to OSI can earn little recognition.
'Most OSI work we sell is embedded under other products,' he says. A
majority of UK building societies now rely on OSI networking products from
Olivetti. But the company's crucial code-writing skills have a low
visibility.
As customers exert greater pressure on costs, Olivetti will have to fight to
justify prices that reflect a great investment in baseline communications
technology. If the PCC is popular BT will have Olivetti's rivals queueing up
to adapt their business computers to the world of video links. Getting in
first has obvious advantages, but staying ahead of the pack could be tougher
than acquiring an open communications capability in the first place.

FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Alcoa falls 33% to ADollars
203.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALCOA of Australia, the aluminium group, yesterday blamed weak world prices
for a 33 per cent fall in net profit to ADollars 203.5m (USDollars 145.30m)
in the nine months to the end of September, on sales down 20 per cent to
ADollars 1.5bn.
Alcoa said lower prices for alumina, aluminium and gold contributed to the
fall in earnings, but were partly offset by lower energy and power costs and
a marginally weaker Australian currency.
Alcoa said aluminium prices had fallen below USDollars 1,200 per tonne after
exceeding USDollars 1,300 earlier this year. However, alumina's price, which
provides about three-quarters of revenue, had improved from about USDollars
140 per tonne to USDollars 160.
Net profits were also boosted by settlement of a tax dispute which reduced
the tax payment from ADollars 198m to ADollars 126m.
'While conditions in the industry remain difficult, the company is confident
it has the capacity to respond to the requirements of its customers as
markets improve,' the directors said.
Alcoa last month paid a fully-franked annual dividend of ADollars 60m,
taking its total dividend payments for the nine months to ADollars 180m, a
return of 43.3 cents a share.
Alcoa is 48.3 per cent owned by Western Mining Corporation, the Australian
resources group. Western Mining warned shareholders in its annual statement
that markets for most of its mineral products were likely to remain
depressed in the current year.
'Improvements in the major world economies appear slow at best and 1992-93
will most likely be another poor year for the mineral industry,' said Sir
Arvi Parbo, chairman.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Observer: In the cold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile in Berlin last weekend, a formidable collection of intellectuals
assembled for a 'last encounter with the cold war'.
Foregathered in the former Soviet Friendship Society were many of the
veterans who had fought hardest against the tyranny of communism - Edward
Shils, Irving Kristol, Robert Conquest and Melvin Lasky, the long-standing
editor of Encounter, the monthly which, it believed, fought the intellectual
cold war almost single-handedly and which died two years ago.
So what are the new dragons to slay? One idea is that there might be another
magazine, even a new broadcasting station, designed to expose the lack of
intellectual freedom in communist China. Another view is that the real enemy
today is within, coming from demands for political correctness in American
universities - though the Europeans were less inclined to spy this as the
new Marxism.
Now that the cold war is over, intellectuals on either side of the Atlantic
may indeed be going their separate ways, as was perhaps already obvious at
the time of Encounter's demise, when there was plenty of American foundation
largesse, provided that some money - if only a symbolic amount - came from
Europe. It did not.
What lives on is the old fighting spirit. Lord Dacre was in Berlin to attack
ideologies of all forms - including religion. It was for that kind of
irreverent approach, as much as for helping to sink the cold war, that the
magazine is missed.

<TEXT>
CUBA'S Communist party has broken its official silence on the sacking three
weeks ago of Mr Carlos Aldana, the party's ideology and foreign relations
chief, saying he was dismissed because of a financial scandal, writes Canute
James.
The party said Mr Aldana, who was also responsible for culture, science and
sports, had accepted favours from a company director who had earlier been
arrested for the evasion of taxes and customs duties and for violating the
country's strict foreign currency regulations.
The statement is an apparent attempt to end speculation that Mr Aldana, an
adviser to President Fidel Castro and one of the architects of government
policy, had been dismissed because he had argued for a moderation of
economic policies, including a more tolerant attitude to private enterprise
in some sectors.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Christian Democrat (DC) leadership yesterday elected Mr Mino
Martinazzoli, a former defence minister, as secretary-general, entrusting
him with the task of revitalising a discredited and divided party .
Mr Martinazzoli, 61, is on the so-called left of the party and is one of the
few senior figures untainted by the series of corruption scandals and
allegations of misuse of power.
He comes from Brescia in the north, where the party has suffered at the
hands of the populist Lombard League. Recent local elections in Mantua
showed DC support had been almost halved within a year, accelerating the
tendency for the party's strength to be reduced to Rome and further south,
where traditional patronage politics still hold sway,
He takes over from Mr Arnaldo Forlani, who was widely blamed for a badly
misjudged campaign in the April general elections when the DC vote fell to
29 per cent - below 30 per cent for the first time. Mr Forlani offered to
step down in the immediate aftermath of the elections, and resigned formally
two months later. But he was persuaded to stay on while the party attempted
to find a successor.
Mr Martinazzoli's main problem is retaining the loyalty of Mr Mario Segni,
the reformist politician who has gathered considerable support inside and
outside the party in a movement to reform Italy's institutions via
referendums.
On Saturday at a rally in Rome, Mr Segni made clear that his ideas about
changing the system squared little with those of the mainstream Christian
Democrats.
Mr Martinazzoli is believed to have offered Mr Segni the number two job in
the party and appears anxious not to lose him since he is the DC's most
attractive electoral card. He is also expected to use the existence of Mr
Segni's reformist movement to get rid of the party's old guard.
The latter, exemplified by men like Mr Forlani and Mr Giulio Andreotti, the
former prime minister, have been keeping a low profile. But it is far from
clear whether they realise the extent to which the rules of the political
game have changed.
Italy faces a four-hour general strike today in protest against proposed
welfare cuts in the 1993 budget. The strike is expected to cause substantial
transport disruption but essential services for health and the public
utilities will be working.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Island row halts Iranian hands of friendship: The dispute
over sovereignty of Abu Musa has poisoned relations in the Gulf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHERRY MOSTESHAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPUTE between Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over control of
the small Gulf island of Abu Musa has shaken the region's recent calm and
handed an unexpected victory to hardliners opposed to the policies of Mr Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's president.
Three years of policies aimed at improving Iran's relations with its Arab
neighbours have been undone in less than a month - and hardliners, ousted
from power in the May elections to the country's assembly, are saying 'we
told you so'.
The issue of who has sovereignty over the island, in the south-eastern Gulf,
has also raised wider antipathies. Iran's old opponents in the region, such
as Egypt, as well as some it has acquired more recently, most significantly
Algeria, have come out in support of the claims of Sharjah, one of the seven
city states which make up the United Arab Emirates, to the island.
Both the Gulf Co-operation Council (Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait,
Bahrain and Qatar) and the 21-member Arab League have condemned Iranian
'aggression' over Abu Musa.
Two months ago Iran was set to restore diplomatic ties with Egypt. But
Iranian hardliners are claiming that a recent statement by Mr Amr Moussa,
the Egyptian foreign minister, that the Arab countries must not give in to
Iran, proves they were right to warn against the liaison. Iran and Sharjah
agreed to share the island under an agreement signed in 1971 which gave Iran
control over security and permitted an Iranian garrison on the island, while
giving Sharjah sovereignty. The dispute now centres on claims that Iran is
using its control of security to take over sovereignty.
Abu Musa and the flanking islands of Lesser and Greater Tumb, also under
Iranian control but disputed by the UAE, form a strategically vital triangle
at the mouth of the Straights of Hormuz at the entry of the Gulf.
Despite President Rafsanjani's protestations in mid-September that his
government's 'hands are ready to press hands of co-operation and friendship
in the region', Tehran appears to be using the Abu Musa dispute to show the
GCC there can be no security in the region without Iran.
Iran has, in particular, been aggrieved that the attempts by the GCC states,
Egypt and Syria, to forge a regional defence structure out of the post Gulf
war Damascus Declaration, little though they have so far come to, have been
made without attempts formally to include Tehran.
Tensions over the island have been growing for eight months, since Iran
refused to allow a boat carrying Sharjah nationals to land at Abu Musa.
Saalam, a daily newspaper which reflects the views of the Iranian
hardliners, has called for a reduction in the level of the Iranian mission
in Abu Dhabi and restrictions on trade with 'the sheikhdoms supporting
hostile policies'.
A report last week by AFP, the French news agency, quoting diplomats in the
UAE as saying that 'Iran has no alternative but to leave the three islands,'
provoked Iranian officials to break with the reconciliatory tones adopted.
Mr Khamel Kharazi, Iran's representative to the UN, and Mr Morteza Sarmadi,
the foreign office spokesman, both claimed that all three islands belonged
to Iran.
Mr Javan Larijani, a senior foreign policy official and member of the
Supreme National Security Council, then used last week's Friday prayer
service to issue a warning to his Arab neighbours. Mr Larijani, said
policies adopted by the Arab Gulf states would lead them to 'destruction'.
He said: 'Experience has proved that Islamic Iran will not allow aggression
against its territorial integrity.'
He also discounted claims by the UAE to have an historic right to the
islands, saying that few of the present Gulf states existed 70 years ago,
while Iran has a history of more than 2,500 years.
While the politicians and negotiators talked of peace in Abu Dhabi, where
the two sides met inconclusively late last month to seek a solution to the
row, several Iranian military chiefs have been using more belligerent tones.
Mr Mohsen Rezai, commander of the Revolutionary Guard, last week told his
troops that if diplomatic means failed 'we are ready to protect our
territory'. General Satari, head of the Iranian air force, said that if any
aircraft took off against Iran, his men would be ready to defend Iran's
soil.
But Iran's newly assertive policy over Abu Musa is also thought to reflect
domestic pressures in the country. A political analyst in Tehran explained:
'Iran is having trouble in her economic policies. This is already putting
pressure on the government. The government therefore cannot afford to give
up an inch of what the people see as Iranian land. It could have a
devastating effect internally.'
What is certain in all the confusion, is that Iran will not move on the
territorial issue. Lose now and the country fears condemning itself to the
second tier in the power structures of the region. More than friends, more
than trade deals and more than international goodwill, Iran believes it must
re-establish itself as a power to be reckoned with in the Gulf, the Middle
East and the Moslem world. Abu Musa appears to be round one in the process.

FT  13 OCT 92 / South Korean TV makers take a bold grip on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE small French town of Fameck near the Luxembourg border recently became
the site of Europe's third South Korean television manufacturing plant when
Daewoo Electronics, the electronics subsidiary of South Korea's Daewoo
Group, opened its Dollars 30m factory.
Samsung started TV production for the European market in Billingham on
Teesside a few months ago and Goldstar has opened a factory in Germany.
The added capacity to European TV production comes at a time when the
European industry is experiencing some of the most difficult trading
conditions in recent history. Television manufacturers throughout Europe
have been under intense pressure as recession has slashed demand and prices
have fallen.
'The market is basically flat in Europe,' says a representative at Philips,
the largest manufacturer in Europe, which dominates the market together with
Grundig, the German manufacturer in which it owns a controlling stake.
Television sales in Europe declined 2 per cent from 22.5m units in 1990 to
22.1m units last year, while in terms of sales value the drop was greater at
6 per cent from Ecu8.49bn (Dollars 11.88bn) to Ecu7.99bn.
The television division of Grundig, which has a strong base in Germany, is
expected to be one of the most affected by the group's decision to cut its
overall workforce by 3,000. It has already closed a TV factory in Barcelona.
Ferguson, which is owned by Thomson Consumer Electronics, closed a
television factory in the UK last autumn. Philips introduced short-time
working in the first half of this year, although its plants are back to
capacity now. Nokia, the Finnish group, expects to ship just 1m television
sets out of a total capacity of up to 2m.
The Japanese manufacturers which set up in the UK have also been hurt.
Panasonic, which has a television manufacturing plant in Wales with a
capacity of 1.2m units a year, announced last month that it was moving to a
four-day working week.
Unruffled by the climate in Europe, South Korean manufacturers have steadily
built up a presence with Samsung claiming brand leadership in the 20-inch
colour television market in the UK. 'Our strategy is to develop a local
business,' says Mr Matthew Simmons, marketing manager at Samsung in the UK.
Mr Chan Jong Lee, deputy general manager for electronics at Daewoo, echoes
his sentiments. 'In order to sell in local markets it is better to
manufacture locally. We are doing this with the European people,' he says.
Both Daewoo's new factory, which will be producing sets ranging from 14 to
33 inches, and Samsung's factory in the UK, have a manufacturing capacity of
500,000 sets each. Compared with the European market of over 20m units sold
in a year, that may be a 'pin prick' as one of the leading European
manufacturers said. The European manufacturers also enjoy strong brand
loyalty in markets such as Germany and France.
However, the South Korean presence in Europe will doubtless intensify
competition in a market where European manufacturers are already feeling the
heat from Japanese manufacturers.
'In terms of brand share development, the overall positioning of European
manufacturers has slightly decreased over recent years,' according to BIS
Strategic Decisions, the market consultants.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Sabah tries to flex its muscles: A look at the worsening
stand-off with Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT takes two-and-a-half hours to fly from mainland Malaysia to Sabah in the
far north of the island of Borneo, almost as long as the flight from Kuala
Lumpur to Hong Kong.
Sabah is the most far-flung state in the Malaysian Federation and has always
had a large degree of independence from the federal government authorities
in Kuala Lumpur.
But trouble is brewing in what the early explorers called 'The Land Below
the Wind'. The government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, accuses Sabah's leaders of plotting to take Sabah out of the
Malaysian federation.
Several people, including the brother of Sabah's chief minister, have been
locked up. The chief minister himself is fighting petty corruption charges
brought by the Malaysian public prosecutor.
The origins of the present stand-off between Kuala Lumpur and the
authorities in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah, go back to the last
Malaysian national elections in late 1990. A few days before polling the
ruling Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) in Sabah decided to pull out of Dr
Mahathir's National Front government.
'We felt the opposition offered more to Sabah than the National Front,' says
Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, leader of the PBS and Sabah's chief minister. The
opposition also looked at the time as if it would win. In the event Dr
Mahathir's National Front government was returned to power, though the PBS
retained its control in Sabah.
Since that election relations between Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu have
gone from bad to worse. 'These people,' says Dr Mahathir of Mr Pairin and
the PBS, 'have no principle, or any commitment at all.'
The PBS says Kuala Lumpur has cut off much needed development funding. While
much of the rest of the Malaysia is fast industrialising, Sabah is
stagnating.
'I feel,' says Mr Pairin, 'like a man under siege.' Mr Pairin insists the
PBS has no wish to take Sabah out of the Malaysian Federation, nor does he
seek a confrontation with Dr Mahathir.
'We want good relations with the federal government,' says Mr Pairin, 'but
Kuala Lumpur has a responsibility to develop the country as a whole - it
should not matter whether the PBS is in power in Sabah or not.'
Race and religion as well as politics are involved in the conflict between
Kuala Lumpur and Sabah.
Dr Mahathir's National Front government is dominated by the United Malays
National Organisation (UMNO), the main party of the Moslem Malays. Sabah has
a population of only 1.7m. More than 50 ethnic groups plus many hundreds of
thousands of immigrants from the Philippines and Indonesia make it one of
the world's more colourful cultural crossroads.
Whereas politics on the Malay peninsula has tended to be split down racial
and religious lines, Sabah has a more pluralistic political tradition.
While Sabah was a member of the National Front government, Kuala Lumpur left
its politicians alone. But now UMNO is using its considerable financial
resources to organise in Sabah. The PBS, many of whose senior members are
Christians, says UMNO is recruiting Moslem immigrants into its ranks. It
says UMNO's arrival in Sabah is divisive and threatens the state's racial
and religious harmony.
Mrs Dayang Mahani, a native of Sabah and an UMNO supporter, disagrees. 'The
PBS has caused the disharmony. We need UMNO here so as to restore relations
with the federal government and make sure Sabah shares in Malaysia's
economic progress.'
Local businesspeople are also concerned that the state is falling behind the
rest of the country. Sabah, with its abundance of natural resources
including timber and off-shore oil deposits, was once one of the richest
states in the Malaysian federation. Now it is one of the poorest. Power
costs twice as much in Sabah as it does in peninsular Malaysia.
The PBS accuses the federal authorities of doing nothing to encourage
foreign investors into Sabah while the big domestic concerns - many of whom
have connections with the governing political parties - will not risk
official disfavour by investing in the state.
There were many in Sabah who objected to the state joining the rest of
Malaysia nearly 30 years ago. Over the intervening period both Indonesia and
the Philippines have launched claims to the state. Now Dr Mahathir is
determined once and for all to claim Sabah for his UMNO party. 'The Land
Below the Wind' will be buffeted by some strong political storms over the
coming months.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Last ditch effort on pregnancy directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LAST-DITCH attempt to save the European Community directive protecting the
jobs and incomes of pregnant working women will be made today at the
informal EC social affairs council in Chepstow, Wales.
The directive would be the first in the social field to lapse since 1985 if
agreement is not reached before October 19. Although some countries with
good provision for pregnant workers are not concerned about a lapse, the UK,
currently President of the EC, is keen to push through a deal.
A possible compromise is likely to centre on an addendum to the directive
which would make some commitment to improving the benefits for pregnant
workers within a specified period. That might persuade Italy, the dissident
country, to fall back into line.
The original proposal was to ensure women the right to return to work and
give them 14 weeks on full pay. UK pressure saw the proposal scaled down to
14 weeks on the equivalent of statutory sick pay.
The terms were then improved to 16 weeks on 80 per cent of salary. Member
states except Italy wanted to stick to the original sick pay proposal, but
to do this they had to reject unanimously the improved package. Italy then
broke ranks, arguing it was not worth having.

<TEXT>
CPC International, the US food company whose products range from Hellmann's
mayonnaise to Knorr soups, saw after-tax profits rise from Dollars 75.5m to
Dollars 117.4m in the three months to end-September.
The strong improvement came on sales up by 7.7 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn,
and translated into an increase in earnings per share from 48 cents to 76
cents.
The figures take after-tax profits for the first nine months to Dollars
318.8m, compared with Dollars 262.6m at the same stage in 1991. Sales for
Dollars 4.81bn, compared with Dollars 4.64bn.
CPC said that the advance reflected 'a solid pick-up' in the North American
consumer foods business, and that it expected a good performance in the
final quarter.
It admitted, however, that it was still feeling the 'effects of recession'
in several European countries.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US household and personal care group, has formed a
joint venture with Compania Manufacturera de Papeles y Cartones to market
disposable diapers and feminine pads in Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay
and Bolivia, Reuter reports from Cincinnati.
The company said the joint venture business in Chile would be conducted
through Prosan, one of the companies in the Compania Manufacturera group,
and each partner would have a 50 per cent stake.

PACIFIC Enterprises, the US energy group, is to sell a large part of its
domestic oil and natural gas assets to Hunt Oil of Dallas for Dollars 371m,
Reuter reports from Los Angeles. The proceeds will be used to reduce debt.
Pacific Enterprises said it took a Dollars 156m, or Dollars 2.09 per common
share, after-tax charge against earnings to reflect an expected loss on the
sale.
The agreement is for the bulk of the company's oil and gas exploration and
production operations, which in 1991 were 5 per cent, or Dollars 324m, of
its operating revenues and 10 per cent, or Dollars 689m, of total assets.
Mr Willis Wood, chairman and president, said the sale was part of a
restructuring plan under which the company will divest from its non-utility
businesses to focus on its core business, the Southern California Gas Co.
He added that, by the end of 1992, he expected to complete negotiations to
sell the company's Canadian oil and gas exploration and production unit,
Pacific Enterprise Oil.

FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Record sales boost Intel
quarterly income by 19%

INTEL, the leading US semiconductor chip manufacturer, yesterday unveiled
record third-quarter revenues and higher-than-anticipated earnings.
Net income rose 19 per cent to Dollars 241m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, from
Dollars 202,m or 96 cents, a year earlier. Revenue was Dollars 1.43bn, up 20
per cent from Dollars 1.19bn.
'This was the best quarter in our history,' said Mr Andrew Grove, chief
executive. 'Our products are enjoying broad acceptance in the marketplace;
our factories are performing at record levels, and our bookings are
excellent.'
Third-quarter results were driven by strong personal computer sales as
buyers took advantage of falling systems prices. Intel is the leading
supplier of microprocessor chips that form the 'brains' of personal
computers. Sales of Intel 486 microprocessors exceeded those of the older
Intel 386 products for the first time.
'The Intel 486 microprocessor is clearly the new personal computer
standard,' noted Mr Grove. The company said business conditions were
strongest in the US and Europe, although improvement was beginning to be
seen in the Asia-Pacific area. The shift to the Intel 486, combined with a
weak dollar, was fuelling business overseas, even in economically troubled
Japan.
During the quarter Intel declared the first cash dividend it its history of
10 cents per share.
For the first nine months, net income wasDollars 638m, or Dollars 2.98 per
share, against Dollars 630m or Dollars 3.01 1991. Revenues were Dollars 4bn,
up from Dollars 3.6bn.
Advanced Micro Devices , which competes with Intel in the microprocessor
market, said its was proceeding with plans for a 'timely introduction of its
versions of the 486 microprocessor' following rulings on Friday in a
long-running copyright dispute between Intel and AMD.
In June a jury found that AMD had used Intel 'microcode', the internal
programs that control a microprocessor, without licence. The case addressed
an earlier math co-processor chip, but forced AMD to postpone plans to
launch its own versions of the 486 microprocessor.
Now AMD believes that the jury decision 'does not resolve questions related
to AMD's rights to microcode in microprocessors', which will await a ruling
by the judge.

<TEXT>
CORNING, the US specialty glass group, yesterday reported flat third-quarter
net earnings of Dollars 107m, or 57 cents a share, compared with Dollars
106.7m, or 57 cents, a year ago.
Stripping out one-time gains of 1 cent a share in the 1992 quarter and 4
cents a share a year earlier, Corning said its earnings per share rose 4 per
cent in the latest quarter.
Sales grew 20 per cent in the three months, to Dollars 1.15bn from Dollars
963.5m.
For the first nine months, Corning earned Dollars 257.2m, or Dollars 1.36,
against Dollars 231.2m, or Dollars 1.24 last year. Sales advanced to Dollars
2.87bn from Dollars 2.43bn.
Mr James Houghton, chairman, said earnings from consolidated operations
showed strong growth in the quarter. The modest earnings performance, in
spite of strong sales growth, was blamed on a Dollars 15m decline in
earnings from Corning's equity companies, particularly Dow Corning.
Equity income from Dow Corning, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical
and Corning which was once the leading US manufacturer of silicone breast
implants, dropped Dollars 12m in the quarter.
Although Dow Corning did not take any charges linked to its now defunct
silicone breast implant operations, the joint venture yesterday reported a
60 per cent drop in third quarter net income.
For the latest quarter, Dow Corning's net income was Dollars 16.4m, against
Dollars 40.5m, on sales of Dollars 500.6m against Dollars 458.7m.
About half of the profits fall was blamed on losses in financial
transactions linked to the recent upheaval in European financial markets.
Weak operating results accounted for the rest of the earnings decline.

<TEXT>
INGERSOLL-RAND and Dresser Industries of the US are going ahead with a plan
to merge virtually all their worldwide pump interests following a decision
by the US Justice Department last month to drop its opposition to the
scheme.
The formation of the joint venture, Ingersoll-Dresser Pump, comes almost 18
months after they originally announced their intention to create the world's
second-biggest pump company after Ebara of Japan.
The move creates a company with about Dollars 900m of sales last year and
8,000 employees.
UK manufacturing facilities at Gateshead, Coleshill and Newark are included
in the deal, but not Dresser's Mono Pump operations.
The merger was cleared by the European Community in January, but the Justice
Department had said the deal was likely to lessen competition substantially
in the US.

CPC International, the US food company whose products range from Hellmann's
mayonnaise to Knorr soups, saw after-tax profits rise from Dollars 75.5m to
Dollars 117.4m in the three months to end-September.
The strong improvement came on sales up by 7.7 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn,
and translated into an increase in earnings per share from 48 cents to 76
cents.
The figures take after-tax profits for the first nine months to Dollars
318.8m, compared with Dollars 262.6m at the same stage in 1991. Sales for
Dollars 4.81bn, compared with Dollars 4.64bn.
CPC said the advance reflected 'a solid pick-up' in the North American
consumer foods business, and that it expected a good performance in the
final quarter. But it admitted it was still feeling the 'effects of
recession' in several European countries.

<TEXT>
ONE OF the potential bidders for Continental Airlines, the US carrier which
has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since late 1990,
withdrew from the running yesterday.
Benefit Concepts, a New York-based firm which was designing an offer which
utilised employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) debt in conjunction with
former executives of the airline, said it was abandoning the effort because
of Continental's refusal to supply confidential financial information.
Continental, by contrast, said Benefit Concepts failed to meet the standards
of a 'qualifying bidder', and hence was not entitled to the information.
So far, three outline investment proposals - from Mr Hurwitz's Maxxam group,
from Mr Alfredo Brener's Houston Air, and from Air Canada in conjunction
with a Texan investment partnership - have met the qualification
requirements.
The approach from Lufthansa, in conjunction with Mr Marvin Davis, the
Californian investor, is still be evaluated. A deadline of November 9 was
recently set for all bidders to submit proposals.

Mr Brian Hall, chairman, said the group had reached agreement with its

repay the balance over the next two years. This would improve the financial
position and, together with the expanded exploration portfolio, strengthen

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday turned in
third-quarter net income of Dollars 14m, or zero cents a share, on
essentially flat revenues of Dollars 3.4bn, reflecting a sharp drop in order
rates and a big provision largely for losses related to an investment in
Phar-Mor.
The Dollars 155m pre-tax third-quarter provision included Dollars 100m for
the Phar-Mor investment, and covered increased credit reserves and valuation
allowances at Westinghouse Financial Services.
A year earlier, Westinghouse had a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.48bn,
or Dollars 4.86 a share, including charges of Dollars 1.68bn.
On Wall Street, Westinghouse shares closed unchanged at Dollars 14 5/8 . The
results were released after the close of trading, and the stock was
unavailable for late NYSE trading.
Analysts had expected third-quarter earnings to fall below second-quarter
levels of 35 cents a share, but the erosion was greater than expected.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENCES between the economic performance of countries cannot be
explained by differences in their electoral systems, according to a study
published yesterday by the Electoral Reform Society.
Proportional representation is neither the threat to economic progress
alleged by the prime minister, nor a panacea for the UK's economic ills as
claimed by the Liberal Democrats and other supporters, the society says.
The study, by Professor Richard Rose of Strathclyde University, compares
five economic indicators for 21 OECD countries to see whether there is any
link between their economic performance and their electoral system.
It finds virtually no difference between countries with proportional
representation and those with first-past-the-post systems in their average
annual growth rates, debt interest as a proportion of GDP or unemployment
rates.
Public expenditure and inflation have risen faster on average in countries
with proportional representation.
What are the Economic Consequences of Proportional Representation? Electoral

<TEXT>
TAY HOMES, the Leeds-based housebuilder, saw year-end pre-tax profits dip 26
per cent in depressed conditions. But turnover increased as it sold more
than 1,000 houses for the first time and it cut gearing.
An increased final dividend of 4.65p was declared, making 5.85p (5.3p) for
the year.
Taxable profits in the year to June 30 1992 declined to Pounds 6.14m (Pounds
8.26m) on sales of Pounds 76.22m (Pounds 70.58m). Operating profits were
down to Pounds 9.25m (Pounds 11.63m).
Reduced gearing of 47 per cent (66 per cent) on borrowings of Pounds 14.2m
was partly due to a shift of costs on a show house joint venture being
shifted off the balance sheet. Interest charges fell to Pounds 3.11m (Pounds
3.37m).
Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, said the year-end figures were an excellent
achievement in uniquely difficult conditions. He said that while a forecast
was difficult, the group's ability to generate profit reflected its capacity
to weather the recession and recover strongly when conditions improved.
Sales of houses, mainly in Yorkshire, rose to 1,094 from 849. The Midlands
was also strong but trading in Scotland declined. Average prices dipped to
Pounds 64,900 (Pounds 74,300), reflecting a focus on cheaper housing.
Sales of mainly Scottish plots from the group's land bank, which stood at
4,800 units at year-end, totalled Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.3m).
Funds tied up in part-exchange homes totalled Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 5.2m) at
year-end.
Shareholders funds rose to Pounds 30.31m (Pounds 28.05m) representing assets
per share of 138.2p (127.9p). Earnings declined to 18.1p (25.1p).

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hongkong Land fails to lift Trafalgar stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SIMON Keswick yesterday confirmed that his Hongkong Land company had
failed to increase its stake in Trafalgar House beyond the 14.9 per cent it
acquired on October 1.
Mr Keswick, chairman, later met Trafalgar House directors to discuss
possible boardroom changes at the UK engineering, construction, property,
hotels and shipping group.
The positions of Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chief executive, and Sir Nigel
Broackes, chairman, are thought to be vulnerable following the Hongkong Land
approach and recent shareholder criticism of the group's management.
Trafalgar said discussions with Hongkong Land had been amicable but no
decision had been taken on management changes, including whether Hongkong
Land would be invited to the board. A full statement on various matters
would be made in due course.
Hongkong Land had sought to raise its stake to 29.9 per cent, but said that
it had received acceptances increasing its holdings by only 1 per cent. The
tender offer, therefore, had been declared void.
Mr Keswick said his company had achieved its objective of acquiring a
strategic investment in Trafalgar, which owned several world class
businesses.
He said: 'Provided the company (Hongkong Land) is adequately represented on
the board, its investment will be long term and it will devote its resources
to the future expansion and development of Trafalgar.
'The investment in Trafalgar represents some 3 per cent of Hongkong Land's
shareholders' funds and leaves the company well placed to pursue other
investment opportunities such as participation in the development of Hong
Kong's newest container terminal.
'In this task Hongkong Land will be able to call upon the assistance of the
wider Jardine Matheson Group.'
Jardine controls 32 per cent of Hongkong Land and jointly owns with
Trafalgar, Gammon construction group in Hong Kong.

PRICE Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, reported fee income rising 2 per
cent to Pounds 395m in the year to June 30.
Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner, said: 'The full impact of the recession is

Audit and business advisory services, comprising one third of total income,
fell 2 per cent to Pounds 137m.
The most significant rise came in the corporate recovery division, which
rose by nearly one third to Pounds 40m, reflecting the firm's work on
companies in financial difficulty.
Management consultancy fell 5 per cent to Pounds 97m. The firm said this was
the result of clients postponing discretionary spending in efforts to
weather the recession.
Corporate finance and privatisation rose 19 per cent to Pounds 16m, while
tax consultancy grew 3 per cent to Pounds 105m.

FRANK G GATES, the east London-based Ford motor dealer, continued to suffer
from the fall in new vehicle sales, especially in fleet sales, and saw
pre-tax profits decline from Pounds 692,000 to Pounds 216,000 in the six
months to June 30.
Turnover at the company, which has five Ford franchises, was down at Pounds
25.8m (Pounds 29.3m). However, Mr Edward Gates, chairman, said that sales in
August, traditionally the highest selling month, were up 85 per cent on the
previous August.
Price-cutting had led to lower margins in new vehicle sales, he said, but
the company was aiming to hold profits rather than just shift units. Service
was 'in line with last time'. The contract hire side (about 80 per cent of
the fleet was sold to Ford Motor Credit Company for Pounds 7m in November
1990) continued to grow - to about 60 per cent of its size before that sale,
said Mr Brady.
Borrowings totalled about Pounds 4m, split between the contract hire side
and the newly refurbished Bishop's Stortford dealership. Interest charges
rose to Pounds 255,000 (Pounds 49,000) as a result. Earnings declined to
0.68p (2.19p) per share.

Holders of the group's two bond issues, which total SFr 200m, also agreed to

date.
The group's banks, which recently agreed to a third standstill arrangement
running until October 31, are providing facilities so that it can continue
trading.
The group's shares were suspended in October last year, when the Serious
Fraud Office sent in investigators. The company was built up by Mr Nazmu
Virani, who is facing fraud charges relating to the collapse of Bank of
Credit and Commerce International. Mr Virani resigned as chairman and chief
executive in April.

sales in the last two months.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 rose from Pounds 2.69m to
Pounds 2.84m on turnover which fell slightly to Pounds 29.51m (Pounds
30.37m) as a result of the disposal last year of the non-core Grimson
stairlift business.
Operating profits, before exceptional items, increased by 13.3 per cent to
Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 2.77m), but the increase was partly offset by higher
net interest payments which grew to Pounds 301,000 (Pounds 83,000).
Earnings per share increased by a modest 2.6 per cent to 2.11p (2.06p) and
the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.2p.
The core commercial and consumer wallcoverings business managed to boost its
market share and increase its turnover by 4.6 per cent to Pounds 25.47m,
mainly because of the inclusion of the Harlequin distribution company in
Germany, acquired in December.
Without this new business Mr Charles Wightman, chief executive, said first
half sales would have been flat. After a strong first quarter Mr Wightman
said sales declined in May and June as business and consumer confidence
evaporated after the election. However he added that there had been signs of
a slight improvement in August and September.
Operating profits from the wallcoverings manufacturing and distribution
businesses, which now also include growing fabrics businesses, rose by 11
per cent to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 3.42m) as a result of 'tight cost control'
and reorganisation benefits.
During the first half Bloom Signs, the group's illuminated sign business,
continued to suffer as a result of the declining UK market and recorded a
Pounds 805,000 pre-tax loss in the first half despite a further substantial
rationalisation. Earlier this month 85 per cent of the business was sold to
its management team for Pounds 650,000.
The interim results include a Pounds 484,000 (Pounds 474,000) extraordinary
charge. The latest charge mainly relates to the costs of the group's
litigation against Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, and William Carr and
his son, Alan, for about Pounds 15m in damages and interest in connection
with the Pounds 3.5m acquisition of Alkar, a shopfitting company, in January
1987. The High Court began hearing the claim on October 1.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Lucas puts new components in place - Paul
Cheeseright details the three-year programme designed to meet changing
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS INDUSTRIES has joined the lengthening list of large engineering groups
engaged in changing the shape of its business.
A three-year programme, embracing the normal gamut of cost reduction moves,
seeks to bring the group more closely into tune with the changing
relationship between component manufacturers and the assemblers of finished
aircraft and motor vehicles.
Competition in the aerospace and automotive industries, where Lucas does the
greater part of its business, has become harsher as recession has deepened.
At the same time, the main vehicle and aircraft manufacturers are reducing
the number of their suppliers. They prefer the stability of a long-term
relationship with a limited number of suppliers to a shifting free-for-all
based on tenders for a particular product.
As its customers change their habits, Lucas changes its own. But it is
changing them against the background of a deteriorating financial position
which has pushed it, like GKN, Glynwed and a host of other engineering
groups, into a search for economies.
The most obvious manifestation has been the growing number of job losses,
which at Lucas will take the size of the payroll to fewer than 50,000 from
more than 57,000 in July 1990.
The changes at Lucas include following the conventional dictum of cutting
back to core activities. It is putting up for sale companies which could
raise about Pounds 100m during the current financial year. The first four to
go have combined sales of about Pounds 150m a year and employ in the region
of 2,000.
The biggest is the fluid power distribution business, which has most of its
sales in the US, Autocentres, a vehicle parts business in the UK with 65
outlets, Defence Fabrications, which makes missile casings in Burnley, and
Aircraft Transparencies, a Luton company making aircraft windows.
The group has also started to consolidate its plants, narrowing the
geographical range of its factories, to have, for example, one product made
in one factory and not in three.
Thus, in Buckingham, where Lucas had three assembly test operations, it has
closed one. It has closed one small plant in Germany and another in France.
Seven units from the group's applied technology division, the largest
employing 250 people, have closed in the US. A Los Angeles plant in the
aerospace division has shut. But new plants have opened in Cleveland,
replacing an outdated one, and in Salt Lake City.
There will be more, so far unspecified, plant closures, with the loss of
jobs evenly split between the UK and other countries. But Sir Anthony Gill,
the chairman, made clear that the UK is likely to remain the group's
manufacturing base.
Although 81 per cent of Lucas's products are sold outside the UK, half of
them are manufactured in the UK. 'There may be an increase in UK
manufacturing. This is a good base,' Sir Anthony said, although he warned
the government to keep inflation down.
Yet there will be shifts in the nature of the manufacturing. Lucas, it is
now clear, will be buying in more components for its systems.
'Opportunities have been identified for more outsourcing, to achieve cost
savings and to enable investment within Lucas to be concentrated on our own
more valuable, specialised and sometimes unique capabilities,' said Sir
Anthony.
The more Lucas concentrates on the higher value-added parts of production
and the more it rests its future on its ability to design products at the
higher end of the technological markets, the greater the need for
investment. Research and development and capital expenditure held up over
the last financial year, but Sir Anthony is making it clear that the group
would like to spread development and investment costs.
Lucas is no stranger to joint ventures. It recently announced two new
partnerships, with Sagem of France and Autobrzdy of Czechoslovakia. And it
wants more.
'What we'd look at is an area where we have a unique capability which we can
exploit more quickly if we go in with somebody else, that's the nature of
the trade-off,' Sir Anthony said.
The search for joint ventures, the simplification of the Lucas manufacturing
network and the re-shaping of the group will be under the control of a new
and, Lucas hopes, streamlined and more responsive senior management.
Following tension on the board earlier this year and the appointment six
weeks ago of Mr John Grant as finance director, Lucas has now decided to
strip out a tier of management. The effect will be to cut central overheads
by 25 per cent. Throughout the group the number of management positions will
be reduced by 250.
Lucas used to have a series of group, sector and divisional executives.
These have been scrapped and replaced by a new and small group executive,
each member of which will be responsible for one of the five portfolios into
which Lucas businesses have now been grouped - aerospace, applied technology
and three automotive areas.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Kunick sells 50% of nursing homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Kunick gained  3/4 p to 5p yesterday after the company announced
it was selling a 50 per cent stake in its nursing homes business to reduce
borrowings.
County NatWest Ventures will pay Pounds 12.5m for a stake in Goldsborough
Holdings, a new holding company for the nursing homes business. About Pounds
18m of Kunick borrowings will be transferred to the new holding company. A
further Pounds 6m of bank borrowings will be repaid once certain
Goldsborough properties are sold.
This will reduce Kunick's net borrowings from Pounds 46m at March 31 to
about Pounds 10.5m.
He said Kunick intended to keep its stake in Goldsborough, which may be
floated at a later stage.
The nursing home business has been burdened by heavy borrowings, and
recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 900,000 in the year to December 31.
Kunick's two French nursing homes are not part of the deal and are being
retained.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (12): Mirror to
market growth - Profile of Novell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH A commanding 60 per cent share of the Dollars 800m worldwide market for
local area network software, Novell is the standards setter in the fastest
growth segment of the computer systems software market.
The company's flagship product, NetWare, had become the de facto standard by
the end of 1986 and since then has steadily gained market share. The program
is a network operating system that manages and controls the sharing of
services, data and applications among personal computers linked to workgroup
and departmental networks as well as company-wide information systems.
The network operating system market grew by about 40 per cent last year,
according to market analysts, and is expected to maintain at least a 30 per
cent growth rate over the next several years. Novell's growth has mirrored
that of the market it serves.
For the first nine months of 1992 the company reported revenues of Dollars
673m, an increase of 49 per cent over the same period last year. Net income
rose to Dollars 179.5m for the nine month period, an increase of 60 per
cent.
The use of local area networks (LANs) has evolved over the past decade to
become a primary element of corporate computing systems. While early LANs
were used primarily to link PCs so that users could share printers or data
storage devices, today many corporations are building 'enterprise-wide'
networks that encompass all of a company's computer systems.
Such 'internetworks' become, in effect, the backbone of a corporate
computing system and the network operating system is a critical element of
the software environment.
Industry analysts predict that, over time, applications programs will
increasingly be written not just for stand-alone computer operating systems
but also for network operating system, enabling data to be more easily
shared among different types of computers.
Novell's expanding role in the software market reflects the growing
importance of networking as an alternative to traditional host computer to
terminal links.
Novell is expected to launch, before the end of the year, a new version of
NetWare that will include features designed to implement international
enterprise-wide internetworks.
The market for enterprise-wide network operating systems is potentially even
larger than the current market for LANs operating systems, according to
industry analysts, and could reach Dollars 1bn over the next few years.
In the low end of the network operating system market for 'peer to peer'
LANs Novell is, however, facing a new challenge from Microsoft, the world's
largest software company, which is about to launch a new version of its
'Windows' operating system designed for use by 'workgroups'.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, claims Windows for Workgroups will
'subsume' Novell's popular 'NetWare Lite' program, a stripped down version
of NetWare designed for small office networks.
Novell has not responded to Mr Gates' taunts, but in spite of its dominant
role in the PC operating system market, Microsoft has so far failed to
unseat the network software leader.
The primary focus of Novell's strategy is in any case focused at larger,
rather than smaller, networks. Recent product introductions include message
handling software, hub software, routing software and network management
software aimed at large scale networks.
Last month Novell also began shipping NetWare SNA Links, a program designed
to enable International Business Machines customers to connect
geographically dispersed PC networks via existing mainframe computer links.
Meanwhile, Novell is mounting its own challenges to Microsoft in the
computer operating systems market. Novell offers DR DOS, an alternative to
Microsoft's MS DOS PC operating system. Through Univel, its joint venture
company with AT&amp;T's Unix System Laboratory, Novell aims to expand the use of
the Unix operating system on PCs, competing with Microsoft's planned Windows
NT. Novell owns 55 per cent of Univel.
In recent years Novell has bolstered its technology base with a series of
acquisitions. The latest is Annatek Systems, a developer of automated
software distribution and management systems that allow network managers to
keep track of software distribution, installation and updates.
Still, large portions of the potential market for Novell's networking
software products remain untapped. Currently about 30 to 35 per cent of PCs
in the US are linked to networks. The penetration of local area networks is
expected to rise to almost 100 per cent over the next decade. Market
analysts expect virtually all PCs used in large organisations to be
connected to networks.
International markets are increasingly important for Novell. For the first
six months of fiscal 1992, sales outside the US represented 48 per cent of
total revenues, up form 44 per cent in fiscal 1991.
Japan represents the company's most promising new market. With an estimated
10 per cent of the world's PCs installed in Japan, fewer than 5 per cent are
currently linked to networks, according to industry estimates.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (14): Not prepared to
play second fiddle - Profile of Cisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG Silicon Valley's 'hot' high-growth companies, Cisco Systems is a
sizzler. The networking equipment manufacturer's revenues have soared over
the past four years with rising demand for products that link incompatible
computers and local area networks (LANs) into enterprise-wide
'internetworks'.
Cisco and others in the internetworking field provide solutions to the
problems of companies and organisations that find themselves with a muddle
of different types of incompatible computers that cannot 'talk' directly to
one another. While there is broad recognition of the advantages of linking
computers into a single 'internetwork' the task is like that of sorting out
a Tower of Babel.
'It is as if you had people trying to communicate by telephone speaking
different languages,' explains Mr John Chambers, Cisco senior
vice-president.
The obvious solution would be to demand that all computers adhere to
standards so that they can share data directly and all 'speak the same
language'.
This, in fact, is the ultimate goal of 'open systems' advocates. In the
meantime, however, computer users are seeking ways to exploit the full
potential of their existing computer systems as well as tying them in to new
equipment.
Rather than attempting to force computer users to buy only computers that
comply with a particular set of data communications protocols, Cisco aims to
enable users to link any and every type of computer on a single
'internetwork'.
'The network should be chosen to suit the computing technology - not the
computing technology to suit the network,' Cisco maintains.
Cisco's 'routers', 'bridges' and 'communications servers' are used to sort
computer data into 'packets', regardless of the data communications
protocols, and then to find the most efficient and economical route to
deliver them to their destination on the network. They also assign
priorities to different packets, delivering the most urgent ones first.
The market for such 'internetworking' products has grown rapidly over the
past few years as corporate computer users have looked for ways to connect
different types of computers and LANs into a single internetwork.
Sales of internetwork equipment will increase from Dollars 344m in 1989 to
Dollars 892m in 1994, according to International Data (IDC), a US market
research group.
Cisco's roots, like those of Sun Microsystems, the leading computer
workstations manufacturer, lie in a Stanford University project to build a
campus-wide network connecting all departments and laboratories.
Work on this experimental network, in the late 1970s helped to establish
several networking standards.
The Stanford group worked closely with the Defense Department's Advanced
Research Projects Agency (Darpa) task force assigned to defining a new
network protocol for use in the international defense research network,
Arpanet. This work led to the development of the Transmission Control
Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) which have become de facto standards
internetworking.
The Stanford network became one of the world's largest LANs in the 1980s,
linking thousands of terminals, personal computers, workstations and
mainframe computers. Recognising the commercial potential of their work, Mr
Len Bosack director of computer facilities for Stanford's Computer Science
Department and Sandy Lerner, director of computer facilities in the Graduate
School of Business, formed Cisco in 1984.
By late 1987, Cisco's monthly revenues were approximately Dollars 250,000.
Five years later, they are running close to Dollars 38m per month.
For fiscal 1992, ending in July, the company reported sales of almost
Dollars 340m, up 85 per cent from 1991, with net income of over Dollars 84m
an increase of 95 per cent from the pervious fiscal year.
One of the biggest challenges - and opportunities - facing the
internetworking industry is developing ways to link systems based upon
International Business Machines' proprietary networking protocols into
PC-based LANs.
Over 60 per cent of large US companies use IBM's Systems Network
Architecture (SNA) as the primary method for tying their computers together.
These networks form the backbone of data communications for many companies,
but they are based upon an hierarchical computing model that is rapidly
becoming outdated by 'peer to peer' networks of PCs and workstations.
Last March IBM made what it called its 'most important networking
announcement since the introduction of SNA in 1974'.
Big Blue unveiled its plans for an Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking (APPN)
scheme that will give mainframe computers an equal footing with other
computers, even PCs, on a network.
IBM promised to make its new APPN protocols available to other computer
makers so that they could build products that can talk to IBM networks.
Rather than play second fiddle to IBM, however, Cisco is establishing a
consortium of companies involved in networking to develop 'open' standards
for linking SNA networks to LANs.
Taking on the computer industry giant, Cisco is promoting its competing
Advanced Peer-to-Peer Internetworking (APPI), as an open, free-of-charge
standard available to all users and vendors.
This bold bid to usurp IBM's traditional role as the computer industry's
'standards setter' may determine whether Cisco can continue to set industry
records for growth.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (13): Widening
horizons worked - Profile of 3COM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PIONEER of local area networking technology, 3Com is also proving to be a
survivor. The Silicon Valley company which played a vital role in creating
the local area network (LAN) market in the early 1980s is making a strong
come-back after refocusing its product line on global networking hardware
two years ago.
Founded in 1979, 3Com commercialised 'Ethernet' networking technology, which
remains a pervasive industry standard for PC networks. Ethernet 'adapter
cards' - add on circuit boards that plug into personal computers and enable
them to be linked to a network - remain 3Com's bread and butter products and
represent over half of the company's revenues.
Ill fated attempts, in the late 1980s, to broaden the company's
participation in the markets for network servers and diskless PCs for
networks were jettisoned last year. 3Com also withdrew from the network
operating systems market in which it had first attempted to establish its
own software standard and then linked with Microsoft by backing LAN Manager.
Already, however, 3Com's new focus on global networking is paying off. In
September, 3Com announced first quarter 1993 net income of Dollars 4.8m on
record sales of Dollars 130.9m. New product orders totalled Dollars 125.9m.
For fiscal 1992, ending May 31, 3Com reported total revenues of Dollars
408.4m, up from Dollars 393.6m in 1991. Net income was Dollars 13.3m, down
from Dollars 15.4m in the previous year, when the company recorded
restructuring charges of approximately Dollars 43m.
Mr Eric Benhamou, 3Com's president and chief executive, attributes the
company's new-found strength to two strategic directions: a relentlessly
global outlook and a steady stream of broad product line announcements to
address important links in the networking chain.
The company is now focused upon four core product lines; network adapters,
terminal servers, wiring systems and hubs and internetworking platforms.
In September, for example, 3Com simultaneously announced 12 new hardware
products in Budapest, Hong Kong, Paris, Sao Paulo, Stockholm and Milan.
These products range from network adapter cards, to structured wiring hubs
for directing and managing networks, to bridgers and routers for connecting
local and remote networks.
These are some of the fruit of Dollars 120m spent in research and
development over the past three years as 3Com beefed up one of the
industry's broadest product lines.
In April 3Com launched the well-received NETbuilder II router that positions
it solidly in 'internetworking', the trend toward linking far-flung local
and wide area networks which enables users to connect their existing
incompatible networking equipment without having to purchase a completely
new networking system.
The internetworking market has huge growth potential. According to Frost and
Sullivan, the US market research firm, 70 to 80 per cent of the 3.7m LANs
installed to date have yet to be linked to internetworks. With the number of
LANs expected to grow to 12.7m by 1995, growth in the internetworking market
may even exceed the pace of growth in the LANs.
3Coms other product plans include an Etherlink family of adapter cards for
the 100 megabit-per-second Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
marketplace. These products are aggressively priced yet carry good profit
margins, analysts say.
The company has also announced a strategy for Asynchronous Transfer Mode
products. It also is expected to launch adapter card products for use in
Apple Macintosh computers and portable PCs.
3Com still faces some stiff competition. In the adapter board business, for
example, Intel, the leading microprocessor manufacturer, has been making a
run at becoming a big time player with aggressively priced 16-bit cards.
3Com also faces stiff competition in the internetworking market from
companies such as Cisco Systems and Wellfleet.
Nonetheless, 3Com has positioned itself to participate in the fastest
growing segments of the networking equipment market and in particular is
targetting the European market.
This year, 3Com announced the acquisition of the networking operations of
BICC Group plc, Europe's largest manufacturer of networking hubs. The
acquisition is expected to strengthen 3Com's market position by expanding
its hub and low-end internetworking lines.
3Com has also recently opened a new manufacturing plant near Dublin,
Ireland. The new plant, in Blanchardstown, represents an investment of
Dollars 16.5m and is 3Com's first production plant outside the US.
Totaling 60,000 square feet and expected to employ 175 people within four
years, the new facility has been specifically designed for the production of
3Com's network adapter cards but may, if necessary, be expanded to produce
internetworking products, the company said.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (7): Waiting to plug
in - Network management potential remains untapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NETWORK management is one of the big challenges confronting the information
technology industry today. The promised land of open systems, which depends
heavily on more effective network management, looks to be still a long way
off.
The aim is to be able to manage distributed information systems as well as
the present generation of centralised mainframe or minicomputer systems. But
experts say this will not happen much before the turn of the century.
Mr Steve Wendler, vice-president of US market research firm Gartner Group,
predicts cautiously: 'In the latter half of the decade we shall start to see
these problems more comprehensively addressed.'
Meanwhile systems managers remain unable to harness the full power of
distributed processing for transmission of large volumes of data across
multi-vendor networks to support their critical applications.
Network management is a relatively new subject.
Estimates of the proportion of IT budgets consumed by network management
range vary from 2 per cent to 20 per cent, but it is generally agreed that
as recession puts budgets under pressure, investment in network management
products has been cut back.
Mr Tony Miller, a consultant systems engineer at Hitachi Data Systems says:
'There is a general reluctance to invest in network management, because
people don't realise that the network is the system.'
The upgrading of corporate networks has been stalled - and in some cases
reversed - by the recession. Meanwhile mergers and takeovers among systems
suppliers have created a lot of work in rationalising their product lines.
Mr Bob Broadbent, general manager of consulting and technical services for
ICL says there are no off-the-shelf solutions yet, so that tasks such as
configuration management and software version control, often require outside
systems integrators to handle.
The network management issue is bigger than most which the industry has
tackled up to now because it requires the collaboration of many large
companies in computing and telecommunications.
Many in the industry say the situation is made worse by the plethora of
consortia and standards bodies which appear to be more in conflict than in
collaboration.
The supreme authority is the International Standards Organisation, which is
developing its open systems interconnection (OSI) framework. But there are
no full specifications for network management within OSI nor are there
likely to be for perhaps 10 years.
The principal network management software products, such as IBM's Netview
and equivalent packages from Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems are moving
gradually towards OSI.
No supplier now questions that OSI is the ultimate goal, but users are left
wondering how to cope until OSI matures. The problem is how to avoid a
strategy which results in their technology being obsolete in three years'
time.
For instance, many users face s choice between the OSI standard CMIP (Common
Management Information protocol) and the SNMP (Simple Network Management
protocol), supported by the Internet organisation.
Many think CMIP will be the long-term winner, since it is seen as the
cornerstone protocol of OSI, but wonder if in the short term they would be
better to back the cheaper and easier, if less secure, SNMP.
SNMP has been widely adopted by users who want to integrate their local area
networks, while CMIP has so far only been taken on by a few large users
seeking to unify their management information from a range of diverse
networks.
These leading users, mainly multinational corporations, will start to adopt
OSI standards more widely in two or three years time. But they will probably
not be able to create a full OSI network until well into the next century.
There are some hopeful signs. One is that the Network Management Forum (NMF)
dropped the 'OSI' from its title, signalling its willingness to adopt a more
pragmatic stance. This has strengthened its position as driver of the
campaign to set networking standards. It continues to support OSI as a
long-term goal, but recognises that users have immediate problems which may
compel them to adopt interim solutions based on less than ideal products.
Omnipoint, an initiative run by the NMF, has brought out a set of standards
for interoperability which appears to be gaining acceptance.
Some users are looking to solve the problem by outsourcing their networks as
well as the rest of their IT. The potential cost-savings from this policy
are less impressive than those gained by devolving responsibility for
hardware or software, but any savings are seen as worthwhile in the current
economic climate.
More importantly, outsourcing can secure access to scarce skills. Mr Chris
Massey, IT manager for the Ticketing Group, part of Wembley, the London
event organiser, says this was the motive in letting Systems Reliability
take charge of his network of Compaqs and Apples.
High level skills such as those required for network management remain in
great demand even amid a rising tide of unemployment.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (6): ATM changes the
rules - Local Area Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth of computer networks in the past decade has pushed communications
technology to its limit.
As companies connect increasing numbers of personal computers and
workstations to their enterprise-wide networks, the limitations of the first
wave of local area network (LAN) technology have become evident.
In addition, companies now see LANs as more than just a way to connect
conventional computers together. They see the potential of multimedia
networks and the applications opportunities they offer.
Consequently, they want to use the same network to carry voice traffic and,
looking to the future, they want to be able to use it for video and images
too.
The combination of these different forms of traffic and the increased volume
of digital data they generate means that existing networking technology is
inadequate.
Fortunately a new technology, which can meet the demands of future networks,
has emerged from the international telecommunications sector: Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) promises to overcome the limitations of current
networking technology and, more importantly, to bring a common form to
networking traffic regardless of its content.
Larger companies are starting to plan for ATM technology and it has backing
from a broad range of computer and communications suppliers:
'ATM technology offers a different way to build networks and will change the
whole networking industry,' says Ms Bobbi Murphy, vice-president of
marketing for Hughes LAN Systems, the communications subsidiary of Hughes
Aircraft.
Hughes LAN is one of the first communications suppliers to come to market
with ATM products. Ms Murphy says existing LAN technology is limited in
'bandwidth', a measure of the amount of data which can be carried on a
communications line. 'If you put more users on the network you run into
performance problems because of the small band width. And it is made worse
by the way that LAN technology works,' she says.
Most LANs us either Ethernet technology or 'token-ring' technology. In both
cases, data is sent around the network in variable length 'packets' - a
method which incurs processing overheads.
Furthermore, a number of different network formats or protocols has grown up
over the past decade and, when a company wants to connect two different
types of LAN together, data must be translated from one format to the other.
When LANs are connected to external wide area networks (WAN), further
translation or 'protocol conversion' is usually needed.
ATM technology aims to solve many of these problems. Like current LAN
technology, it also uses 'packets' to carry data. But it avoids many of the
problems by using a fixed-size packet. Each ATM packet - known as a 'cell' -
contains only 53 bytes of data, including five which are used for addressing
and routing the data through the network.
This has a number of advantages - the most important being that the cells
can be handled by hardware, thus speeding up the network. The speed of
transmission is crucial when carrying the voice and video signals over the
network. Current LAN technology operates at a maximum transmission rate of
10 megabits a second and has the potential to handle much higher rates.
Mr David Drury, European general manager for US supplier Fore Systems, sees
the scalability of ATM technology as one of its main virtues: 'There is a
hierarchy of speeds possible with ATM from 155 megabits up to 2.4 gigabits.
'If you run out of bandwidth between points in the network - you don't have
to throw it all out - you can upgrade those parts of the network where
higher speeds are needed,' he says.
'It is the first time you will have all communications in a single media
format. It is not just a 'go-faster' technology - it enables new
applications.'
Fore Systems began delivering ATM compatible networking products in May and
sees it as an important growth area. Like Hughes LAN, Fore Systems sees the
main demand for products which can help the transition from current LAN
technology to ATM.
'We can provide products which can link to current technology like Novell's
Netware,' says Mr Drury.
A big advantage of ATM is that the large telecommunications suppliers -
including AT&amp;T and MCI in the USA and British Telecom in the UK - are
committed to move to the technology for their long-haul networks. Once in
place, all types of data can be moved from source to destination without the
need for conversion.
'It will probably be 1995 before the wider ATM infrastructure starts to slot
into space. But there are opportunities now for companies to use it for
high-speed LANs,' says Mr Drury.
The UK could be in the forefront of the move to ATM technology. Plans have
been approved by the UK government to upgrade the Janet network, which links
UK universities and research institutes, to ATM technology. The new network
will be known as SuperJanet and will use ATM technology to link 200 sites
across the UK.
'We aim to offer much higher performance and provide a multi-service network
to handle voice, data and multimedia,' says Dr Robert Cooper, director of
networking for the UK universities and national research institutes.
'We are moving more towards image-based communications and this will open up
all kinds of new applications.'
Dr Cooper says education and medical applications in particular will benefit
from the faster speeds and greater bandwidth offered by ATM. A pilot
application to link six UK sites with ATM is scheduled to start in March
1993.
It seems likely that this will be the first of many moves towards ATM
technology for future networking needs.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (8): Towards a world
without paper / A look at the ways electronic data interchange is being put
to work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rapid growth in the use of electronic data interchange (EDI) by
companies and other organisations to exchange information, particularly
routine documents such as orders and invoices, is beginning to transform the
traditional paper-based business transaction.
EDI is a value-added network service which enables two organisations, such
as customer and supplier, to exchange business documentation in a standard
electronic form using their own computers linked through a service provider.
It is one of the most dynamic applications made possible by computer
networking and is expected to grow steadily in importance and eventually
replace paper-based transactions in many business sectors.
Typically, a standard business transaction such as an order is generated on
a computer, printed out, sent to a supplier and then re-keyed into another
computer. EDI provides an electronic 'short-cut' which is faster and often
cheaper than paper-based transactions and reduces the need for re-keying
data and therefore the risk of error.
Orders or invoices sent by EDI can be placed and confirmed in seconds and
one US study suggested that electronic trading can reduce the cost of
processing a form by 90 per cent. By reducing the time taken to process a
transaction manufacturing companies and retailers can reduce their level of
stocks and adopt management techniques such as just-in-time inventory
control.
Trading information electronically can also help suppliers and their
customers align their operations more closely to sales patterns and other
variables, and lead to a closer 'partnership' between supplier and customer.
In addition using EDI automatically sets up an 'audit trail' which enables
an organisation to check and validate electronic documentation or bill a
transaction between separate parts of the same organisation.
These benefits have brought big growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it
originated and in the UK, which is generally accepted to be the EDI leader
in Europe. However, Ovum, a consultancy specialising in telecommunications
market, suggested in a recent forecast that the rest of Europe is catching
up fast. Two years ago, Britain accounted for 60 per cent of European
EDI-users. Now, the proportion is down to 40 per cent.
Between 6,000 and 7,000 companies and organisations in Britain are using
electronic trading and the number is growing by more than 20 per cent a
year. But there is still room for growth. Some recent estimates have
suggested that only 3 per cent of business transactions in the UK are
currently handled by EDI.
International Network Services (INS) the biggest of the UK-based EDI
services providers with an estimated 55 per cent market share, handles over
6m documents a month on its Tradanet service and says 100 new companies are
joining it's 'EDI community' every month. Its customers include 78 of the
top 100 UK companies, nine of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest
pharmaceutical companies, 17 of the top 20 non-life insurers, 10 regional
health authorities and four clearing banks.
Other EDI network service suppliers in the UK include AT&amp;T Istel, which has
a strong base in manufacturing industry, British Telecom, IBM, and
SD-Scicon. Companies use these service suppliers because they provide a
central 'post office' function, directing message traffic to the appropriate
recipient and providing any 'data translation' needed between different
computers or message standards.
UK sectors which have pioneered the use of EDI include the motor and
electronics industries and the retail trade, particularly the supermarket
chains. The large scale usage by supermarkets in particular highlights the
particular attractions of EDI to businesses with high volumes of low-value
transactions and those involving fast-moving or perishable goods.
Although EDI is still a relatively new use of networking technology some
clear trends are emerging. According to Mr Colin Billinge, marketing
director for INS, these include:
Internationalisation. There is an increasing use of Edifact (EDI for
Administration, Commerce and Transport), the emerging group of international
message standards. Mr Billinge estimates that somewhere between 15 and 20
per cent of INS's customers now have international links. Retailers led by
Tesco and Boots, which have developed extensive domestic supplier networks
using EDI, are now doing the same with overseas suppliers.
Tesco started its international programme in January with MD Foods, its
Danish dairy products supplier. Since then it has extended its use of
INS-Tradanet overseas to include selected Belgian, German and French
suppliers. By the end of this year it expects to have established EDI links
with 50 or more overseas suppliers.
'Our aim is to extend significantly our electronic trading links with
European business partners, initially for the transmission of EANCOM
purchase orders, followed by invoices and other documents such as forecasts
of expected demand,' says Mr Geoff Warburton, Tesco's controller.
In Europe, where only about 2 per cent of EDI traffic is trans-national,
this process is likely to be accelerated by the introduction of the EC
single market at the end of this year.
Mr Patrick Smith, Boots' EDI manager, says: 'The single market is providing
us with the springboard from which to extend our electronic trading links to
our numerous international suppliers. The benefits of international EDI are
likely to be even greater than we have seen nationally to date, shrinking
both time and distance, enabling us to ignore geographic boundaries.'
Increasing Sophistication. Originally EDI tended to be used only for basic
transactions like ordering and invoicing. However as familiarity with
electronic trading has grown, so has the range of information transmitted
over EDI links.
Some EDI users are now using the system to exchange information, such as
demand forecasts, with their suppliers.
For instance Tesco, which has built a network of more than 1,000 firms
communicating electronically, has begun to issue 13-week rolling forecasts
of demand to some of its suppliers. By cutting the time between placing an
order and delivery retailers and their suppliers can operate more
efficiently, cut their administrative costs and keep stock levels to a
minimum.
Some EDI pioneers have even begun to introduce self-billing and automatic
re-stocking of customers. Using EDI trusted suppliers can be authorised to
deliver goods as their customers' stocks run low, without needing order
messages. Meanwhile customers can invoice themselves and arrange payment
through the banks, which are also starting to join in the EDI networks, thus
eliminating the whole paper transaction cycle.
Integration. EDI is being integrated into the fundamental business process.
One effect of this is that there is a growing use of EDI to exchange
'unstructured data' for example design work or cad-cam drawings.
EDI is also being integrated into existing internal electronic mail systems.
Using EDI in this way enables a customer to link two incompatible Email
systems, for example in different departments or divisions.
Software such as INS- Ediswitch is being used by companies to provide both
an internal data switch and a gateway to the outside third party services
providing what Mr Billinge describes as 'the first complete 'one-stop shop'
for electronic trading.'
EDI is also gradually reaching a wider audience. Not only are new sectors,
such as the book industry in the UK, beginning to adopt electronic trading,
but customers are devising new innovative uses for EDI.
EuroDollar, the UK's second largest daily car rental company, is using it to
combat car crime. When EuroDollar purchases a new vehicle its details are
sent electronically to HPI, a vehicle information specialist, to be stored
in its Security Register. Over 16,000 motor dealers check the history of a
used vehicle they are offered against the register.
If the vehicle appears on the register, HPI warns the enquirer and the
owner, so if EuroDollar receives an 'alert' from HPI, it knows one of its
fleet is being illegally offered for sale and can take immediate action.
Government departments and other public sector organisations such as the
national Health Service are also increasing their use of EDI. Within the UK
government, the Education Department is probably most advanced in its use of
EDI and electronic messaging and all 117 education authorities have now been
linked into its dedicated EDI network. Other departments, including the Home
Office and the Central Statistical Office, are also examining the potential
use of what has become known as administrative EDI - to differentiate it
from the usual commercial uses of EDI.
The growing use of EDI by both the private and public sector means that it
is becoming increasingly important for even small suppliers to have access
to an EDI network. Already many big UK companies have begun signalling to
their suppliers that they must adopt EDI in the next few years if they want
to continue trading together. EDI capability is rapidly becoming part of the
cost of doing business.

FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa in talks to sell part
of stake in luxury hotel chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German airline, said yesterday it was negotiating to sell
part of its 42.6 per cent stake in the Kempinski luxury hotel chain.
The negotiations follow Lufthansa's announcement last June that it was
scaling down plans to merge Kempinski with Air France's Meridien chain.
Lufthansa said it was in talks with several interested parties, but the most
likely buyer of the Kempinski stake is thought to be Advanta Management, a
German investment group controlled by Mr Hans Dieter Bock.
Der Spiegel, the German news magazine, reported recently that Lufthansa
would retain an interest in the chain of about 10 per cent. It is believed,
however, that Lufthansa would like to keep its stake in the chain at above
10 per cent.
The plan to merge the Kempinski and Meridien chains was announced last
April. It would have created an 80-hotel group with 25,000 employees and
annual sales of Dollars 1bn. Air France would have been the majority
shareholder in the merged company. The hotels would have retained their own
names.
Meridien has 60 hotels worldwide. Kempinski is strongest in Germany, but
with a growing presence in North America and Asia.
In June, however, Lufthansa said it regarded the merger as a long-term
objective only. In the interim, it said, co-operation between the two hotel
groups would be limited to a joint marketing arrangement.
Lufthansa said if the marketing arrangement was successful, a mutual holding
company would be created.
It said that no further decision would be taken without the consent of
Lufthansa, thereby ensuring that the interests of the Kempinski chain would
be assured.
The scaling-down of the merger plan led to speculation that the Kempinski
management had opposed the deal. Lufthansa was also said to be concerned
that a merger could threaten standards at the Kempinski hotels. The German
airline said that any arrangement would have to ensure that quality of the
Kempinski hotels was upheld.
Lufthansa said it could not comment on the future of its relationship with
Air France while the current negotiations were in progress.

FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: French adventure leaves sour
taste - Italcementi's takeover of Ciments Francais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Mr Giampiero Pesenti, the entrepreneur who controls Italcementi, Italy's
biggest cement group, it has been a week to forget. Less than six months
after catapulting his company to the top of Europe's cement league through
the surprise purchase of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais of France,
the deal has turned sour following the discovery of substantial off-balance
sheet losses at the French company.
Italcementi's problems are doubly ironic for both its chairman and
Mediobanca, the powerful Milanese merchant bank that is its main adviser.
Last April's agreement to buy control of Ciments Francais was hailed by
Italian investors. After Pirelli's failure to buy Continental and the
Agnelli family's discomfiture at the hands of Nestle in the battle for
Perrier, an Italian entrepreneur had finally pulled off a cross-border coup.
The praise was shared with Mediobanca. The bank's low-profile approach to
corporate finance, based largely on personal contacts with a select group of
institutions, appeared out of place. The Italcementi-Ciments Francais deal
showed that the bank was not superannuated.
That the transaction has turned complex is a blow to both Italcementi and
Mediobanca, two companies equally renowned in Italy for their distaste for
publicity.
Visitors to the Milan headquarters of Mr Pesenti's Italmobiliare holding
company, which controls Italcementi, might easily think they have strayed.
The impressive palazzo bears no nameplate. Only after passing a discreet
porters' lodge, which bears no reference to the company, comes the security
check giving access to Mr Pesenti's domain.
The low profile contrasts with the policy of Mr Pesenti's father Carlo, who
built the group into one of Italy's leading conglomerates.
The price for expansion was debt. Following his father's death in 1984, Mr
Pesenti sold assets to reduce borrowings under Mediobanca's guidance.
Italmobiliare slimmed down to its core cement business, retaining some
sidelines in engineering, publishing and tourism. Meanwhile, Mr Pesenti won
admirers, culminating in his appointment as chairman of Gemina, the
Fiat-controlled investment and financial services group in which Mediobanca
and Italmobiliare are also shareholders.
In the past two years, Italcementi, which has been solidly profitable
throughout, has been making a more public come-back and has been expanding
at home and abroad.
Last year, it bid unsuccessfully for Cementir, the state-owned cement group
put up for sale by the IRI holding group, and Heracles, the Greek
cementmaker, which fell to Ferruzzi's Calcestruzzi cement and building
materials subsidiary. But Italcementi managed to purchase two of
Czechoslovakia's leading cement producers. Buying into Ciments Francais was
its biggest coup. With a combined production of around 36m tonnes a year,
the group is now the world's second-largest cementmaker.
But even Italian plaudits for the purchase were clouded by criticisms of its
financing. In spite of its liquidity, Italcementi had to launch a rights
issue, along with a convertible bond, raising about L650bn (Dollars 500m) to
help pay the L1,700bn purchase price.
Minority shareholders were furious to be offered only non-voting savings
shares in the bond, and to have to pay the same price for ordinary and
savings shares in the rights issue. Some were further incensed by the sharp
fall in Italcementi's share price in the run-up to the deal, triggering
demands for an investigation into insider trading.
Typically, Italcementi has made no official statement about the problems in
France, while Mr Pesenti himself remains incommunicado.
Company officials merely note that matters are being tackled jointly by
Italcementi, Mediobanca, Ciments Francais and Paribas, the French bank that
controlled the French cement producer, and that all four are determined to
reach an amicable solution.
Italcementi also stresses it will not suffer financially. It claims the
recent devaluation of the lira has actually worked in its favour, as it had
already bought French francs - now worth more in lira terms - to finance the
deal prior to the lira's slide. Nor does the discovery of off-balance sheet
losses at Ciments Francais affect the 'industrial logic' of the deal, it
says.
However, it is still far from clear how easy it will be to plug the gap in
the finances of Ciments Francais, which was discovered by Italcementi's
auditors, KPMG.
Two ideas are now being touted. Either Italcementi, which will not pay for
the acquisition until year-end, will re-negotiate the price, or Paribas, as
vendor, will make up the losses.
Renegotiation could be a minefield in view of the fact that Ciments Francais
launched a big share placing in July. Though largely shunned by investors,
allowing the Italians to pay less for the company could require compensation
to shareholders who subscribed to the issue.
Hence Italcementi's apparent preference for the second option. Letting
Paribas make up the 'gap' in the accounts of Ciments Francais means
Italcementi would buy what it expected, and minority shareholders in Ciments
Francais could not claim compensation. With Paribas considering legal
action, that idea so far seems to be more popular in Milan than Paris.

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday reported
a decline in profits to NKr369m (Dollars 61.5m) from NKr445m for the first
eight months. The company was saved from going into the red by a NKr680m
profit on the disposal of its stake in Cia Valenciana de Cementos, the
Spanish cement producer.
However, Aker did fall into an operating loss of NKr93m in the period, from
a profit of NKr341m last year, due to a NKr430m loss at Norwegian
Contractors, part of the oil and gas technology division.
Mr Tom Ruud, Aker's president and chief executive, said that new equity and
group transfers totalling NKr400m would be injected into NC before the end
of the year.
Aker's two main divisions - cement and oil and gas technology -
significantly increased sales to lift group operating revenue to NKr11.487bn
from NKr8.303bn in the same period last year.
The oil and gas technology division increased sales by NKr3.1bn to
NKr7.534bn, although it fell into an operating loss of NKr223m from a profit
of NKr211m last year, and order reserves rose to NKr15bn from NKr11.5bn in
the period. The cement division lifted sales by NKr217m to NKr3.963bn.
Operating losses fell by NKr2m to NKr53m.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (11): Tackling change
head on - Profile of Digital Equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment is betting its future on open systems. The world's
second-biggest computer company - and the first to build its success on the
popularity of minicomputers - has declared that open systems are vital to
its survival.
This is radical stuff, particularly for a company that built its fortunes on
'proprietary' computer designs. However, according to Digital Equipment's
new president and chief executive officer Mr Robert Palmer, the company will
not make it to the end of the century without these changes.
'Digital is facing a much more competitive environment than it has ever
faced before,' he said in his first major speech since taking the top job at
Digital. 'Driven by open systems and by breakthroughs in silicon technology,
a massive change has been sweeping through our industry. The historically
high margins on hardware and the business model upon which Digital was built
are no longer sustainable.'
Mr Palmer says Digital has had to change totally the way it operates. 'As
computer hardware performance skyrockets, open systems and the competitive
process are driving down prices and squeezing margins, requiring that we
lower our cost of doing business.
'We understand that very clearly. It comes to us in the almost paradoxical
messages that we get from our customers. In terms of hardware, customers
have never been as empowered to control the market as they are today.
'At the same time, the rapidity of technical change and the difficulty of
integrating divergent systems has had an unsettling effect on many
customers.
'Some customers are outsourcing - delegating total management of their
computers to us. Others are seeking a greater level of advice, support and
partnership from us than ever before.'
One clear demonstration of this commitment has been the development by
Digital of its OpenVMS environment - an 'open systems' variation on the
company's popular VMS minicomputer operating system for its VAX range.
Critics of OpenVMS might suggest that this is merely Digital's attempt to
cash in on the popularity of open systems. But Digital says that it has
changed the name of VMS to OpenVMS to reflect its 'product branding' from
the X/Open independent open systems group - and that OpenVMS is now the
first premier, commercial operating system to achieve such a level of open
systems conformance.
According to X/Open spokesman Mr Michael Lambert, Digital's work towards
more open systems by conforming to the standards set by his consortium will
serve it in good stead.
'OpenVMS represents a clear response to user needs and the strongest
possible commitment to open systems,' he said. 'Digital is clearly confident
that OpenVMS can compete on its merits without the protection of a
proprietary lock-in.'
In addition, Digital says the OpenVMS environment - along with the OSF/1
(Open Systems Foundation) and Microsoft Windows NT operating systems - form
the foundation of Digital's new strategy.
Meanwhile, Mr Martin Hingley - a senior technology analyst at International
Data Corporation (IDC) - suggests that Digital seems to be taking the right
approach by building 'open systems compliance' into both the name and
content of VMS.
'Open systems are about a lot more than just Unix,' he says. 'With OpenVMS,
Digital's customers no longer need to make choices between 'standards' and
the high performance of VAX. Digital also stands to expand its government
business in Europe.'
Digital has another weapon in its open systems arsenal. Known as Alpha, it
is a 64-bit computing architecture designed to give Digital a huge
performance edge over the competition.
The first implementation of the Alpha architecture is Digital's DECchip
21064 - which it claims is the world's fastest microprocessor, running at
clock speeds of 150 to 200 Mhz. The fastest microprocessors typically used
in today's personal computer systems only run up to 66 Mhz.
Digital says that although its latest systems do not use this much-touted
Alpha architecture yet, they have been designed to be 'Alpha-ready'. This
should mean that the company's current and prospective customers can
'migrate' in the future from existing systems to more powerful VAX or
Alpha-based systems.
The final word on these and other plans belongs with new Digital boss Mr
Palmer. 'We are committed to the concept of being customer driven,' he
promises. 'As our customers demand more, we intend to deliver what they tell
us they need. For example, customers are demanding open systems - open
systems are driving this market. Digital will therefore do whatever has to
be done to be a leader in open systems.'
The company, he adds, is also aggressively investing in systems integration
and consulting expertise as a part of this drive. 'Digital's systems
integration business is growing at more than 20 per cent per year and is
profitable.
'It represents an excellent opportunity, exceeding Dollars 2bn in revenue in
our fiscal year. We will continue to focus here, and in our multivendor
service capabilities. We now service more than 10,000 hardware and software
products from 1,300 different vendors.
'And that number is growing. Digital does a better job integrating multiple
vendors, hardware and software products than anyone else in the industry,
and we will continue to focus on that capability . . . We are committed to
expanding our industry-focused applications by substantially growing the
number of our software partners.'

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (10): Manna to the
management - Executive information unlocks data stored in different systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVE information systems have been around since the mid-1980s but it
has taken developments in other areas since then to get them widely
accepted.
Recent studies suggest that over 40 per cent of the top 1,000 companies in
the UK now have these systems and that 7,700 managers in those companies use
them. The number of users is expected to grow by 30 per cent this year.
In theory and, increasingly, in practice, executive information systems are
the answer to senior management's prayers. They unlock the masses of data
stored in different systems across an organisation and present it as
colourful, graphical summaries. Users can seek further detail by touching
areas on the screen or using a simple keypad or conventional keyboard, but
the emphasis throughout is on ease of use.
The raw data behind the charts and graphs comes from the traditional
corporate or departmental systems handling order processing, stock control
and so on. Other possible sources include external databases or news
services, word processors and electronic mail systems.
The executive information system's role is to extract the relevant data from
many sources and present it as information in the formats demanded by the
users, often on a personal computer connected to a central system. The PC
can usually be connected to gather the latest data and then used on its own
for examining the information.
The format and content of each chart have traditionally been fixed when the
system is set up. The idea was that the system would reflect the periodic
management briefing book.
There are simple links between charts: an executive could move from a
consolidated sales graph to a chart about a troubled subsidiary and then to
a region and down to an individual shop, product or salesman - each time at
the touch of a key or a spot on the screen.
Instant access to summary information, the potential for highlighting
exceptions or variances with budget and the ease with which executives can
find the reasons for a variance, in terms of an individual salesman's
performance, have thrown up major implications for entire organisations.
Users have pointed out that with paper reports, if a problem is highlighted
at a monthly directors' meeting, someone is asked to gather information for
the next meeting. An executive information system provides the detail
immediately.
This in turn means people further down in the organisation, close to the
problem, have to confront realities and react quickly: they can no longer
fudge an answer for senior executives, because those executives have the
hard data.
The direct access to information and closer ties between with junior
managers also mean the top executives no longer need all the support people
who in the past would have been responsible for gathering data and turning
it into information reports. In some cases companies have cut three or four
layers of management after setting up an executive information system.
Even so, views on the success of the systems have been mixed, at least until
recently. At the start of the 1990s studies by Business Intelligence, a
research company which largely specialises in executive information systems,
found that although 75 per cent of managers had seen improvements in
financial control, information quality and problem solving, similar numbers
reported no advantages from replacing existing paper systems.
Mr David Harvey, a director of Business Intelligence, says the
disappointments were largely due to a failure to apply technology properly.
'Simply replacing the briefing book is like using a racehorse to pull a
cart,' he says. 'Too many of these companies failed to think through exactly
what they wanted. You have to think about how the system can change the way
the organisation is run.' However, two separate recent developments are
starting to change attitudes towards executive information systems and to
expand their use.
First, in the past year suppliers have responded to developments in
so-called client-server computing, open systems and graphical user
interfaces and have built more flexibility into their systems.
Established and traditionally mainframe computer systems are now being
offered for PC networks. Where systems used to draw data from corporate
files into their own databases specifically for their own use, they now
provide direct links into popular database systems such as Oracle and
Ingres. In addition, system development aids are being provided so that a
user company's computing specialists can set up screens and the links
between them.
'Originally executive information system suppliers provided a closed package
of user interface software, processing software and data, but now we're
separating the components and going for open systems architectures,' says a
spokesman for Pilot Executive Software, which vies with Comshare for the
title of market leader.
Prices have also moved more into line with what PC users expect: traditional
mainframe systems have cost tens of thousands of pounds to set up;
Comshare's new offering starts at Pounds 13,700 for 10 networked PCs.
The second development affecting executive information systems is in
business thinking.
'Traditionally finance has been the only measure of corporate finance and
executive information systems have tended to provide financial reports,'
says Mr David Harvey at Business Intelligence. 'But now there is pressure to
redefine business performance measurement and bring in other factors.'
Such developments have helped increase both the use of executive information
systems and users' satisfaction with them.
At Norwich Union, for example, a Comshare system is used daily to look at
relevant news from the financial press and analyse it under headings such as
insurance companies and disasters. Yorkshire Water monitors trends in water
quality, as well as capital investment and human resources.
The expanding application of executive information systems seems to have
brought greater user satisfaction. New research by Business Intelligence*
shows that 33 per cent of users mention tangible benefits, 58 per cent
intangible benefits and 10 per cent both. Only 4 per cent report no
benefits.
In addition two-thirds say their systems have 'substantially' improved their
decision making, largely through the ability to get to the bottom of
exceptions.
The expanding application and the increased satisfaction are leading to
wider use. In the Business Intelligence survey 40 per cent of respondents
said they would have over 50 users within two years and a further 20 per
cent expected similar growth in the next three years. In 7 per cent of
organisations there would be 1,000 users by 1997.
Such growth perhaps explains why suppliers, while keeping EIS as their
product name, are increasingly changing the meaning to enterprise
information systems.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Australians may bid for parts of RHM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOODMAN Fielder Wattie, the Australian food group which unsuccessfully
offered Pounds 1.7bn for Ranks Hovis McDougall in 1988, yesterday said it
might bid for RHM's continental European baking and milling activities if a
hostile Pounds 780m takeover by Hanson succeeds.
Mr Michael Nugent, chief executive, said some of RHM's continental
businesses 'could be of interest to us, and we will keep watching that
particular situation.' He did not divulge which businesses interested GFW,
or how much it would be prepared to pay.
RHM's continental European business had net assets of Pounds 16.9m in the
August 1991 balance sheet and achieved trading profits of Pounds 2.6m on
sales of Pounds 73.6m in the 1990-91 year, down from Pounds 4.7m and Pounds
75.8m previously. They comprise three milling and one bakery company in the
Netherlands, and a bakery group in France.
GFW's European foods division generated sales of ADollars 750.5m, a fifth of
the group total, in the year to June 30, and the group has made no secret of
its plans to acquire further businesses.
European activities centre on milling and baking businesses in Belgium, the
Netherlands, France and Germany, where Mr Nugent believes long term European
growth will be strongest.
Earlier this year the group merged its Melvin and Bakkerij Hendriks baking
businesses in the Netherlands into a single business under the name Quality
Bakers Europe.
It described the ADollars 14m acquisition of Limburgse Molens, a
privately-owned Belgian flour miller, as a step towards building 'critical
mass' in milling and baking.
GFW disposed of its 29.9 per cent holding in RHM after its bid failed, and
was later the target of a failed ADollars 3.1bn counter offer from RHM. Last
week it sold its Wattie Foods business in New Zealand for ADollars 428m and
paid ADollars 330m for the Uncle Toby's food and snack group.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Publisher with a flair for the right image
 -Dorling Kindersley plans to raise Pounds 30m through a flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRIKING combinations of images and text on the page have fuelled the rapid
growth of Dorling Kindersley, the British publisher which is soon to be
floated on the stock exchange.
The Covent Garden-based company, which is likely to have a market
capitalisation of Pounds 75m-Pounds 100m, is best known for books such as
Penelope Leach's Baby and Child manual and its encyclopaedias of gardening,
plants and flowers, produced in association with the Royal Horticultural
Society.
Mr Peter Kindersley, the company's chairman and chief executive, said
illustration used to be an afterthought in British publishing, with poor
pictures and graphics just dropped anywhere into an already written text.
DK's reference books are conceived from the outset as an integral
combination of images and words, with captions wrapped round high quality
photographs and graphics, printed on clear white backgrounds.
The company spends as much as Pounds 2,000 per page in its books - well
above the industry average. Mr Kindersley, 51, who trained at arts school,
believes publishing has suffered from a failure to invest sufficiently in
its products, which in turn leads to low profit margins.
DK recoups this heavy investment by achieving high sales of its reference
books for adults and children. Most of the company's titles sell more than
100,000 copes, even although the majority are in hardback. To date, 38 have
sold more than 500,000 copies and 12 titles have sold more than one million
copies.
The sales level results from the company's decision to focus on the
international market. DK's books currently sell in more than 80 countries
and in 37 languages. Last year 30 per cent of group sales were in the UK, 32
per cent in the US and 38 per cent from the rest of the world.
The increasingly international outlook of the business has spurred growth at
DK, which saw its pre-tax profits double to Pounds 7.5m in the year to June
on sales which increased by 66 per cent to Pounds 70.9m.
Mr Kindersley believes that publishing has suffered from the dominance of
author's agents, who have been been able to extract huge advances by forcing
individual publishers to bid against each other for each new title in
separate territories around the world.
DK's royalty rates and advances tend to be lower, since the company normally
originates the concept and is responsible for commissioning authors, rather
than bidding for ideas from authors. Some titles have no named authors, thus
saving royalties completely.
The company publishes a relatively small number of titles, bring out only
168 in the last year. DK says this enables it to concentrate its efforts on
achieving high quality and on heavily marketing the finished products. Of
the company's 700 employees worldwide, 400 are editors and designers.
DK describes itself as market-led, with each new book idea being developed
after extensive market research. The group aims to ensure that likely sales
will cover the costs of each new title, and employs no fewer than 50 people
on foreign rights.
Since the company was founded in 1974, DK has published more than 560
titles, 90 per cent of which are still in print. About 30 per cent of the
group's turnover comes from 'backlist sales' - titles which have been
published for more than a year or two. DK said only 6 per cent of its books
were returned by shops - compared with an industry average of more than 20
per cent.
Another strong selling point has been DK's success in signing up learned and
official bodies - such as the British Medical Association, Red Cross and
London's Science Museum - to advise on and endorse publications, in exchange
for royalties. The American Medical Association endorsed a Family Medical
Guide which has already sold 5.3m copies and continues to sell 100,000
copies a year, providing a steady stream of income.
DK's pathfinder prospectus, being published today will seek to raise Pounds
30m in new money for the company. The flotation is being sponsored by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with Cazenove acting as broker.
The shares will be firmly placed with financial institutions, but will be
subject to clawback by financial intermediaries for sale to private clients.
Mr Kindersley's family will own about 45 per cent of the enlarged share
capital.
One of DK's most successful ventures has been its Eyewitness series of
children's books, which it established in 1987 with the French publisher
Gallimard. Since 1988 the Eyewitness series has sold more than 13m copies in
30 languages.
Mr Kindersley is at his most eloquent about the growing importance of
education. He believes that in a culture flooded with fleeting images, both
children and adults can best learn by browsing and indulging their
curiousity in a careful blend of images and text.
Perhaps the most exciting long-term prospects come from DK's link with
Microsoft, the US computer software company which after the flotation will
have a 20 per cent stake in the British company.
Both companies have just finished work on their first joint project, an
interactive CD 'reference book' of musical instruments. Having slotted the
CD into an appropriate personal computer, users can interrogate the huge
database - calling up pictures, words and sounds of the world's instruments.
Mr Kindersley believes this interactive form of education has huge
potential, and will also provide a lucrative outlet for DK's existing
archive of more than 500,000 images.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Exports offset Highland home downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG growth in export sales of The Famous Grouse scotch whisky helped
Highland Distilleries to recover from first-half setbacks and increase full
year pre-tax profits 2 per cent from Pounds 28.16m to Pounds 28.74m.
Exports of the company's premium scotch brand rose 29 per cent in value and
16 per cent in volume compared with overall industry export gains of 12 per
cent and 4 per cent respectively.
Earnings per share for the year ended August 31 were maintained at last
year's 15.1p. A final dividend of 4.55p (4.14p) lifts the total payout to
6p, an 8.9 per cent increase.
Operating profit declined from Pounds 22.41m to Pounds 21.92m on turnover 4
per cent higher at Pounds 169.4m (Pounds 163.37m).
Export sales of Famous Grouse amounted to Pounds 25.5m compared with Pounds
19.9m in the previous year. Distribution through Remy Cointreau secured
increased sales in a number of European markets including France, Sweden,
the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal.
Highland now exports 37 per cent of its whisky. Overseas sales of Famous
Grouse have risen from 50,000 cases in 1975 to 750,000 cases.
Volumes declined 6 per cent in the UK market where overall Scotch sales were
11 per cent down - a trend which provoked strong criticism of the UK
government's taxation policy on spirits from Mr John Goodwin, chairman. 'The
complicated and illogical tax system reduces UK employment and damages the
balance of payments,' he complained.
Famous Grouse, the best-selling whisky in Scotland with a 24.5 per cent
share, consolidated its number two position in the UK as a whole, raising
its market share from 13.3 per cent to 14.2 per cent. Prices were increased
11.5 per cent in the UK and 8.6 per cent overseas.
Sales outside the group of new and mature whisky for blending were 30 per
cent lower than last year as customers reduced stocks. Industry production
was cut 7 per cent in the first half of 1992 following last year's 4.4 per
cent reduction. Highland's distilleries are now running at 60 per cent of
capacity.
Cash flow generated Pounds 10m of funds and net gearing was reduced from 13
to 6 per cent.

First-half 1992 pre-tax profits from Mid-States, the London-quoted
distributor of car parts in the US, were 17 per cent down on the
corresponding figure, but 37 per cent ahead of the second half of 1991
largely as a result of cost reductions.
Pre-tax profit this time for the company which is based in Nashville,
Tennessee, came to Pounds 1.92m, against Pounds 2.33m and Pounds 1.4m in the
second half, generated from turnovers of Pounds 24.9m, Pounds 23.8m and
Pounds 25.1m respectively.
Earnings per share worked through at 3.2p (4.1p) and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.75p.

landfill.
Turnover came to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 23.3m) and the loss before tax to
Pounds 1.21m, compared with Pounds 1.39m. Continuing activities provided
Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 2.76m) of sales and Pounds 204,000 (Pounds 440,000) out
of an operating profit of Pounds 399,000 (Pounds 897,000).
Mr Peter Woodman, chairman, said the group was currently trading above break
even, but he remained cautious about the year's results.

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of 13 Maori tribes, has failed to stop the New Zealand government
backing a deal that could see forestry group Carter Holt Harvey selling its
Sealord fishing division to a joint venture of Maori people and Brierley
Investments.
The dissident group, including Maori from the distant Chatham Islands,
opposed a deal that was previously agreed by most Maori tribes. This was
supposed to be a 'final settlement' of all fishing claims dating back to the
Treaty of Waitangi signed with the British in 1840.
Mr Justice Heron, in the High Court in Wellington, yesterday rejected a bid
to order the Crown not to settle the deal until there was a full court
hearing about the rights of Maori who didn't agree with the settlement.
His decision permits the government to lend the Maori people NZDollars 150m
(USDollars 81m) to form a joint venture with Brierley Investments to buy
Sealord, which is New Zealand's biggest deep-sea operator, and owns 26 per
cent of all New Zealand fish quota.
Mr Justice Heron refused to grant approval for the objectors to continue the
case. He ruled that a substantive hearing, involving points raised by the
objectors, could be heard before the year-end.
Maori and the Crown have been negotiating for years to try to settle Maori
fishing claims.
Some Maori had already signed the deal, but others refused or said it was
signed on their behalf without authority.
The hearing removes the major obstacle for the Maori-Brierley Investments
offer for Sealord to go ahead. A rival group, led by a Danish group Royal
Greenland, has also said it is bidding for Sealord.
Carter Holt Harvey is expected to make a decision on the rival bids shortly.

World Trade Centre to Resourceful River, a mainland Chinese concern, for
HKDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 323m), Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Mr David Lee, WTC general manager, said the deal to sell the shopping and
office complex in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay district would bring a net profit
of about HKDollars 650m. Shareholders have yet to approve the deal.
In May, Hongkong Land sold a central district block to a Chinese consortium
for HKDollars 3.8bn.
Mr Lee said: 'The proceeds will be used to repay debts, finance the
company's various projects in China, and for strategic investment in Hong
Kong and south-east Asia.'
On September 1, the Hong Kong government appointed an inspector to probe the
affairs of WTC and Tomson Pacific after a Securities and Futures Commission
investigation into certain share deals by the two companies.

FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Campbell launches bid for
Arnotts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the US foodmaker, yesterday launched a surprise ADollars 8.80
a share offer for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, in which it holds a
32.9 per cent stake.
Campbell, which has a sizeable biscuit and bakery division in the US where
it manufactures the 'Pepperidge Farm' brand, said its objective was to
secure control of Arnotts by acquiring a further 17.2 per cent of the shares
at a cost of ADollars 209m (Dollars 149.20). However, the group said it was
prepared to move to 100 per cent control at a cost of ADollars 943m.
The offer, which is subject to approval by the Foreign Investment Review
Board (FIRB), values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn. Campbell already has FIRB
approval to acquire up to 40 per cent of Arnotts.
Arnotts, which was informed of the offer only minutes before it was
announced by the Australian Stock Exchange, advised shareholders to take no
action until after a scheduled board meeting tomorrow.
Schroders Australia, the investment bank appointed to advise the Arnotts'
board, said the offer was 'not nearly good enough' to secure control of the
group's large range of premium brands.
'I would have thought a first shot across the bows would have been in the
region of ADollars 12,' said Mr Paul Binstead, a director of Schroders'
investment banking division.
Analysts said the small premium over Arnotts' closing share price of
ADollars 8 suggested Campbell was testing the market, possibly to flush out
potential rival bidders such as Pacific Dunlop, the diversified Australian
manufacturer, or United Biscuits of the UK.
Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive and himself an Australian, said
the offer was 'a logical extension' of the technical and marketing
relationship between the companies, which began in 1985 when Campbell helped
Arnotts resist a bid by Mr Alan Bond.
'We are sharing high-value ideas, technology, and know-how with Arnotts. We
need majority ownership to justify sharing of our proprietary assets,' he
told the Arnotts board in a letter.
Campbell had started to buy shares in Arnotts in 1984, and pointed out
yesterday that it was 'invited by the Arnotts board to become a major
shareholder in 1985'. Today, Campbell has two representatives on the
Arnotts' board.
Mr Johnson said Campbell would develop Arnotts' dominant position in
Australia and help it increase sales in Asia, widely seen as a potentially
lucrative market for Australian food manufacturers.
Arnotts', he indicated, would become Campbell's 'pan-regional brand' in
Asia, and could utilise the US food company's sales and distribution network
in the region.
The US company's existing biscuit and bakery division had sales in the year
to August of Dollars 808.6m and operating profits of Dollars 90.6m.
'The world food and biscuit industry is becoming increasingly globalised.
Arnotts needs a global partner to help it take advantage of new
opportunities,' he said.
Campbell said Arnotts would remain a stand-alone company run by its current
management team.
Analysts said this was probably an attempt to deflect criticism of the sale
of the company's well known brand names to an overseas owner.
The offer is the fourth big development in the Australasian food market in
little more than a year.
In the earlier deals, Pacific Dunlop acquired Petersville Sleigh from the
collapsed Adsteam group last year, while Goodman Fielder Wattie sold its
Wattie offshoot in New Zealand to Heinz of the US for ADollars 428m and
bought the Uncle Toby's group in Australia for ADollars 330m.

Disgruntled shareholders in Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale
brewer, have requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting at which
resolutions to replace two directors with two shareholders will be put.
Mr Richard Cattermole, leader of the dissident group and a 5 per cent
shareholder, said he was waiting to hear from the company when the meeting
would be held.
Mr Cattermole said he had circulated the group's shareholders and found a
high level of dissatisfaction among them. He owns Ryan Elizabeth Holdings,
which owns 45 pubs and a chain of hotels.
There has been speculation about a takeover of Hoskins by Ryan Elizabeth. In
the year to March 31 Hoskins' pre-tax profits were Pounds 83,000.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Lifting market share through co-operation -
How British insurers are running their overseas businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S troubled insurance companies continue to shy away from joining
forces in the domestic market, but overseas they are becoming increasingly
keen on co-operation.
Recently, for example, Sun Alliance and Royal Insurance merged their
Australian subsidiaries, and Prudential sold its Canadian general insurance
side to General Accident.
The deals reflect an increased tendency for the UK's composite insurers to
join forces or co-operate in rationalising their interests in markets,
typically those in the Commonwealth, where individually they lack
significant market share.
And at a time of worldwide capital shortage, they also reflect the
increasing popularity among insurers worldwide of alliances as a means of
expanding abroad.
Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, described the Australian deal as
'another step in Royal's strategy to operate overseas when appropriate,
through joint ventures in collaboration with partners.'
Royal, which joined forces with Aaachener and Muenchener, of Germany and
Fondiaria of Italy, to form a European joint-venture last year called EPIC,
is particularly keen on the idea, partially because of the weakness of its
own capital base, which has been eroded by heavy losses in recent years.
EPIC, based in Rotterdam, pools together the non-domestic market operations
of all three companies. The decision to sell its Dutch subsidiary, Royal
Nederland, to EPIC, has provided valuable capital to boost its balance sheet
at home. The Australian merger with Sun Alliance released a further Pounds
50m which can be deployed at group level.
Mr Gamble also stresses the potential economies of scale that co-operation
brings. Management resources are often scarce in smaller markets, and
co-operation allows companies to save in areas like information technology.
He says that improved return on capital can be obtained, pointing to the
success of Royal's South African subsidiary, in which it shares ownership
with Old Mutual, one of the Republic's biggest insurers.
Royal also shares - with Commercial Union - ownership of La Republica, one
of Chile's leading companies, and has joint ventures in Kenya, Malaysia and
Zimbabwe.
In the past Sun Alliance, the country's strongest insurer, has been less
enthusiastic about joining forces with rivals. But Mr Roger Neville, the
group's chief executive, last week hinted at a change in approach. 'We've
tended to do it 100 per cent but times have changed,' he said.
In recent years Sun Alliance has signed co-operation agreement with insurers
in Japan, South Korea and China. And in May it reached agreement with
Helvetia of Switzerland to jointly develop international commercial lines
business.
In Australia Sun Alliance already shared with Royal Insurance ownership of a
78 per cent stake in AAMI, a successful direct writing motor insurer, as
well as a marine insurance agency. Sun Alliance initially approached Royal
about a merger of its Australian operations in June, and teams from both
companies worked throughout the summer on the project
Neither company was big enough individually to influence general rating
trends explains Mr Tony Barron, director of Sun Alliance (Overseas). The
combined operation, with a market share of over 6 per cent, is in a much
stronger position. Sun Alliance was particularly influenced by the increased
success it enjoyed in New Zealand after it acquired the local interests
there of Guardian Royal Exchange in January last year.
In a similar example earlier this year GRE chose to merge its operations in
Australia with the Swiss company, Zurich Insurance. GRE owns a 25 per cent
stake in the merged operation, creating Australia's fourth biggest insurer.
In Canada, the Prudential chose to sell its non-life operation to GA, which
has now become the biggest insurer in the Canadian market with a share of 8
per cent.
All the companies involved are keen to stress that the deals are limited to
particular markets and do not foreshadow integration of operations in the
domestic market.
Commenting on the Australian deal, Mr Neville of Sun Alliance emphasised
that 'every territory is different and must be taken on its merits' while
Royal's Mr Gamble is keen to stress the number of companies with which Royal
is prepared to do business.
Even so, as competition in the 1990s gets tougher and the UK faces up to the
continuing threat from Europe, the lessons learned abroad may yet have
application at home.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 3.65m sale by Medeva of non-core
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY

<TEXT>
MEDEVA, one of the newest arrivals on the pharmaceuticals scene, is raising
Pounds 3.65m from the sale of some of the products which it bought as part
of a package from Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham earlier in the year.
'We have achieved the acquisition of the jewels without having to hang on to
the others,' said Mr David Lees, finance director. The 'core' products being
kept include Pregaday, Fefol and Feospan, which are iron supplement products
for pregnant women.
The products being sold to Goldshield Pharmaceuticals and Forley have annual
sales of Pounds 2.5m. The consideration represents a slightly lower multiple
of sales to that obtained by Glaxo and SB when Medeva paid Pounds 18.4m for
the original package.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Rebels call for Clark to be put up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARDROOM split at C&amp;J Clark took a further twist yesterday when the
rebel directors called on the board to put Britain's largest shoe
manufacturer up for sale.
A circular is being prepared by the rebels urging shareholders to call for
the drawing up of a sale prospectus which would put Clark into play. Robert
Fleming, the merchant bank, has agreed to act for the four board members.
The move comes just four days before the extraordinary general meeting aimed
at deposing the chairman, Mr Walter Dickson, and non-executive director, Mr
James Power. The rebels are seeking changes to the corporate strategy
pursued by Mr Dickson.
The requisitionists, as the rebels are named for calling the egm, have
proposed two new board candidates, Mr Hugh Pym, ITN journalist, and Mr
Michael Markham, a businessman. They claim to represent some 40 per cent of
the Clark family holding. The Clarks control 80 per cent of the company
through direct stakes and family trusts.
Mr Markham said yesterday that the decision to call for a sale came as a
result of the approach received from management consultant, Mr Colin Fisher,
backed by venture capital group, Electra Investment Trust.
'The requisitionists accept that the company has been put on bid alert,'
said Mr Markham. However, he questioned whether an offer backed by Electra -
which would depend on the failure of the requisitionists proposals - was in
the best interests of all shareholders.
'The company has to get the best offer,' he said. The discussions with
Electra 'do not give a flat playing field to anyone else.'
The board said yesterday it was aware of the rebel's latest move but it too
was considering soliciting other bids through Schroders, its financial
adviser.
The rebel's efforts to attract bidders is, to some extent, a gesture to the
large number of Clark family members who might be interested in selling
their holdings. Mr Markham said the requisitionists wanted to dispel any
suspicions that they had a 'bunker mentality', an image which could reduce
shareholder support on Friday.
The company nearly embarked on a partial flotation in 1987. It came close to
rounding up support from the necessary 75 per cent of shareholders but it
dropped the proposal shortly before an egm.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Insurance proceeds help lift S Lyles to
Pounds 1.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
S LYLES, the yarn spinner and dyer, marginally improved its profit in the
year ended June 30, but taking in a Pounds 260,000 exceptional credit the
increase was 40 per cent.
Including the credit, which represented insurance proceeds arising on the
death of a director, the pre-tax balance rose from Pounds 813,000 to Pounds
1.14m.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 16.7m reflecting a decrease
both in home and export sales. Earnings per share came to 10.66p (7.42p) and
the final dividend is 3.35p for a total of 4.9p (4.45p).
Mr John Lyles, chairman, said trading conditions were difficult and the
'whiff of the optimism detected this spring in the home market fast
disappeared. We have so far had a disappointing start to our year'.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Shepherd Neame expands 10% to over Pounds
4m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shepherd Neame, the independent Kent brewer, raised pre-tax profits by 10
per cent from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 4.06m in the year ended June 27, 1992,
on turnover 14 per cent higher at Pounds 35.82m.
Operating profits climbed 20 per cent to Pounds 6.22m indicating the
economies of scale from supplying an enlarged pub estate. Finance charges
were up 27 per cent at Pounds 2.18m.
Mr Robert Neame said the increase had been achieved despite the company
trading almost exclusively in the south east, where the recession had been
most severe.
The Faversham-based company had leased 58 pubs from Whitbread, which offered
the opportunity of increasing volume throughput without further capital
outlay. Together with the purchase of other pub packages from Bass and
Courage the previous year, this took the Shepherd Neame pub estate to 372.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK bus group buys into New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAGECOACH, the UK's largest private bus company, has won approval from
Wellington City Council in New Zealand to buy its bus, tram and funicular
railway services for NZDollars 8m (Pounds 2.56m).
The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of this month and
will add about 270 vehicles to Stagecoach's 3,000-strong worldwide fleet.
The Wellington operations employ about 450 people, mainly on the city's 'Big
Red' bus services.
Stagecoach, based in Perth, Scotland, operates six regional bus companies in
the UK. But about 20 per cent of turnover is overseas, from locations as
varied as Kenya, Malawi, Canada and China.
A company spokesman said Stagecoach had been interested in New Zealand since
the country passed legislation similar to the UK in 1989 to privatise bus
services. 'They drive on the left, which also helps,' he said.
Staffing levels are now similar to those among privatised UK bus operators
and the spokesman said cost savings from efficiencies would be small.
Although the company is interested in further New Zealand acquisitions,
other large councils such as Christchurch and Auckland have yet to announce
plans to open up services to the private sector.
Stagecoach has also looked at Czechoslovakia and is trying to break into
Hong Kong, which recently announced plans to increase competition for the
colony's bus services. The company lost out in the first new franchise to be
offered earlier this year.
Stagecoach already has a small joint venture in Hong Kong which repaints
second-hand buses with advertisements for Japanese and South Korean
companies. The buses are then given to China for free, while Stagecoach is
paid by the advertisers.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Dan-Air in talks on rescue with BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVIES &amp; Newman Holdings, owner of the Dan-Air airline, is in rescue talks
with British Airways after abandoning negotiations with Mr Richard Branson,
owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways, writes Paul Betts.
British Airways yesterday refused to comment on whether it was considering
the rescue of Dan-Air. It appears to have been approached by Mr David James,
Davies &amp; Newman's company doctor-chairman, and may be re-examining the
Gatwick carrier after ending talks last month.
Airline industry analysts said BA might be put off any salvage operation if
that entailed lengthy regulatory hurdles from the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. Last night British Midland expressed concern at a possible
BA/Dan-Air link and said it would call for scrutiny by the MMC and
regulators in Brussels.
Mr Branson said that if his withdrawal resulted in 'letting in a big bad
wolf . . . then Virgin European Airways will be born'. He believes that
sufficient routes would be shed to enable him to set up a niche carrier.
Hopes have faded that Dan-Air can survive as an independent entity without a
substantial partner and refinancing.
It is feared that this year's losses will take the pre-tax deficit for the
past three years towards the Pounds 100m mark. The parent company looks
certain to breach its ceiling for bank borrowings this winter.
LTU, the German travel group, refused to comment on Dan-Air yesterday.
After buying the Thomas Cook travel agency chain, it is looking at other
areas of the holiday industry.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Lucas to lose 4,000 jobs in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, one of the UK's largest engineering groups, is shedding at
least 4,000 jobs in a three-year restructuring programme. It will sell
companies which are not central to its aerospace and automotive business and
move its manufacturing operations on to fewer sites.
To pay for the restructuring, the group made a provision of Pounds 88.4m in
its 1991-92 results. The figures, announced yesterday, showed a sharp
reduction in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.5m from Pounds 82.8m in the year
to July 1991, and a net loss of Pounds 8.8m compared with a net profit of
Pounds 49.4m last time. Lucas had a loss per share of 1.2p, against earnings
per share of 7.1p a year earlier.
The performance came as no surprise to the stock market which was heartened
by the maintenance of the dividend at 7p a share. The share price quickly
climbed 10p before settling to close at 94p for a day's rise of 4p. This
gave Lucas a market value of nearly Pounds 660m.
Lucas started its restructuring programme earlier this year. It has already
reduced its workforce by 1,250. The remaining 2,750 jobs will be lost,
roughly evenly, between the UK and overseas, taking the total number of
people employed worldwide by the group to around 47,000 from more than
57,000 in July, 1990.
Sir Anthony Gill, chairman, warned that the first half of the current year
will be little better than the 1991-92 first half, when Lucas had pre-tax
profits of Pounds 200,000 topped up by a Pounds 90m contribution from its
pension fund.
The pension fund contribution is offsetting the future cost of the
restructuring programme. In 1991-92 Lucas had in any case paid Pounds 23.7m
in redundancy and reorganisation costs. These sliced into trading profits
and left operating profits at Pounds 58.3m, half the previous year, but
earned on sales 5 per cent down at Pounds 2.37bn.
Lucas found all its aerospace markets weaker: operating profits were reduced
in the UK while losses were incurred in North America and continental
Europe.
By comparison, its automotive business had a glittering year. Operating
profits at Pounds 38.6m nearly reached the level of the previous year and
sharply higher profits in continental Europe more than offset losses in the
UK and North America.

VOLVO, Sweden's leading car corporation, confirmed yesterday it will decide
next month on closure of two of its three assembly plants in the country
with the potential loss of 1,630 jobs. The step reflects Volvo's severe
overcapacity in a shrinking car market.
The plants have been operating at half capacity for some months. Their
shutdown would concentrate production in Sweden in Gothenburg.
A decision to close the two other plants, at Kalmar and Uddevalla, would
produce an annual saving of between SKr300m-SKr400m (Pounds 42m).
It was mainly due to the idealism of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's executive
president, that the plants were created as showcase examples of the
company's commitment to a production revolution. This involved the
abandonment by Volvo of the traditional mass-assembly method of assembling
cars in 1974 when it opened the new plant at Kalmar. Multi-skilled
assembly-work teams were introduced and backed by computer technology in the
provision of supplies.
The Uddevalla plant was opened only in May 1989 at a cost of SKr1.5bn and
quickly became a focus for international attention as Volvo claimed it was a
complete break with the Henry Ford way of car production. It produces the
940 model at the moment.
Yesterday Volvo also announced it was making a further cut of 12,000 in its
car production programme for next year in response to the continuing decline
in sales. This follows a decision taken two weeks ago to reduce production
at the company's Ghent plant in Belgium by 4,000.
Volvo said that a joint investigation was being carried out with the Swedish
trade unions on the future of the Kalmar and Uddevalla plants. This will be
completed early next month and then presented to the Volvo board for its
final decision. It seems unlikely that either plant will remain open for
much longer.
Volvo insisted yesterday that any decision to close Kalmar and Uddevalla
stemmed from over-capacity problems and not poor productivity or other
troubles at the two plants.
Yesterday's announcement from Volvo comes as no surprise. Only last week Mr
Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault, Volvo's French
partner, warned that there had to be a 'a profound restructuring' of the
Swedish carmaker which would be 'painful but necessary'.
In August Volvo reported a SKr103m loss (after financial items) for the
first half of the year and it has continued to suffer from declining sales
in the vital North American market. By the end of this year the company will
have cut its annual cost level by about SKr5.2bn since 1990. The latest
announcement is in addition to its earlier cost reductions.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Mastering Gatwick's history lesson: The dilemma facing
operators at one of the world's busiest airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
History may have caught up with Davies &amp; Newman, owner of Dan-Air - the
oldest British airline still operating under its original name.
If Dan-Air collapses, its demise will echo that of other Gatwick-based
scheduled carriers. Air Europe sunk with its parent, International Leisure
Group, in March last year. British United was taken over by British
Caledonian in 1971. Nearly four years ago, BCal was in turn bought by
British Airways which is still trying to turn around the Gatwick operations.
Some will blame the recession and recall that Dan-Air entered it in a
weakened state. Others will ask whether Mr David James, the company doctor,
was too daring in expanding the scheduled side of the business, rather than
cutting costs and losses.
But the question will also be reiterated: is it commercially viable for an
independent airline to run a scheduled European network based on Gatwick?
The crux of the problem is whether enough higher-fare business travellers
can be attracted to Gatwick to prop up the yield (average revenue per seat).
Gatwick is one of the busiest international airports in the world, with
nearly 20m passengers a year, but only one in five are business travellers.
That compares with nearly half of the 44m passengers at Heathrow.
Gatwick suffered last year when the London air traffic distribution rules,
preventing new carriers operating from Heathrow, were abolished. That
prompted several airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, to move flights to
Heathrow.
According to BAA figures, Gatwick traffic has fallen by 11 per cent, from a
peak of 21.2m in the year to March 1990 to 18.9m in 1991-92. Business travel
shows a decline to 20.7 per cent, from 22.5 per cent in 1990-91.
The BAA also uncovered uncomfortable statistics last year among business
people based in the Gatwick heartland south of London. 'Four out of five
Brighton businessmen were driving past and going to Heathrow; and only one
in six from Redhill was using Gatwick.'
Gatwick's prominent role in carrying leisure traffic is reflected in the
high proportion of charter flights and of leisure travellers on scheduled
services. The 44 per cent of non-scheduled flights from Gatwick compares
with 0.2 per cent at Heathrow.
Heathrow's greater volume of business traffic creates a virtuous circle,
whereby it can offer frequency of flights and connections with other
airlines' flights.
To offer comprehensive timetables, airlines have to run off-peak services at
lower yields to complement their busy morning and evening trips.
Again, Heathrow has an advantage. As Mr Randolph Fields, a former
shareholder in Davies &amp; Newman, puts it, Heathrow's ability to 'skim off the
high-yield cream' also enables airlines operating from there to 'penetrate
the low-yield market at will on a marginal cost basis'. The competition for
off-peak traffic is effectively cross-subsidised.
The advantages are reflected in the contrasting fortunes of Dan-Air and
British Midland, the UK's second biggest scheduled airline, which controls
14 per cent of the slots at Heathrow.
British Midland is profitable and has attracted a substantial partner.
Scandinavian Airlines System paid Pounds 50m for a 40 per cent stake in its
parent company.
British Airways' losses at Gatwick bode ill. BA is tackling this by making a
virtue of Gatwick's 'one-terminal hub and spoke facility', dovetailing
short-haul and long-haul services. Traffic has increased after a
rescheduling exercise and costs have been cut; about 300 jobs were shed
earlier this year.
Two conclusions Virgin reached studying Davies &amp; Newman's books were that
Dan-Air should be pruned and simplified.
The gravity of Davies &amp; Newman's financial position has incurred the problem
of ebbing customer confidence.
The UK's top three package holiday companies, Thomson, Owners Abroad and
Airtours, all have their own airlines. It is, perhaps, no coincidence that
Airtours, once a big Dan-Air customer, announced that it was setting up an
airline in late 1990, about the time of the first Davies &amp; Newman financial
crisis.
Uncertainty exacerbates the situation since the suspension of Davies &amp;
Newman's shares on September 28. The pressure is on Mr James to organise
swiftly the third rescue in two years.

<TEXT>
KRAFT General Foods Inter-national, part of the Philip Morris group of the
US, yesterday won control of more than 50 per cent of the capital in Freia
Marabou, Scandinavia's leading chocolate and snacks producer.
Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest publicly quoted company, which controls 44.1
per cent of Freia's shares together with its pension fund, yesterday
accepted the offer which values the company at Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 882m).
It also accepted on behalf of Procordia, the Swedish food and medical group,
and Paulig Services, a Finnish company. 'Consequently, a total of 54.9 per
cent of the shares of Freia Marabou is covered by the acceptance,' Norsk
Hydro said.
The move virtually extinguishes any hope held by Hershey Foods of the US to
acquire the company through a rival bid which it was considering with Orkla,
the diversified Norwegian food group.
Hershey controls 18.6 per cent of Freia's capital. KGFI needs a two-thirds
majority to push the deal through and the many small shareholders could pose
an obstacle to a rapid conclusion.
KGFI subsidiary Jacobs Suchard on September 28 offered to acquire Freia
Marabou for NKr450 a share. Freia Marabou's B-shares closed NKr5 up to
NKr435 yesterday on the Oslo bourse, but news of the Norsk Hydro acceptance
came after close.
If the bid is successful, the company is to be called Freia Marabou Suchard.
The offer offer expires on November 11.
KGFI promised Freia's shareholders it would ensure the company's growth and
expansion. With the help of Jacobs Suchard, Freia's exports could rise by
5,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes within five years.
It said Freia's activities, board and management would remain intact and the
company would take over responsibility for Jacobs Suchard's chocolate and
sugar confectionery in the Nordic region, as well as in Britain, Belgium,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the Baltic states.
Norsk Hydro stands to gain pre-tax profit of NKr2.4bn on the disposal which
it says will strengthen the company's financial position. Norsk Hydro's
pension fund will receive NKr500m from the sale of its 5.8 per cent Freia
Marabou stake.

FT  13 OCT 92 / US political clout won tank deal, says Vickers: Lost
contract with Kuwait could cost British jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICKERS, the UK engineering group, yesterday accused the Bush administration
of using political leverage to clinch a crucial Kuwaiti tank deal for the US
company General Dynamics just ahead of the American presidential election.
The company is considering asking the British government to protest to
Kuwait over the way the decision was handled.
Vickers was hoping for a contract from Kuwait worth Pounds 1bn for
Challenger 2 tanks, including spares and support. One of its two tank
assembly lines at Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne could face closure if other
Gulf export deals for the new tank fail to materialise by the end of next
year.
News of the Kuwait setback follows announcement last week of a wage freeze
at the two plants, each of which employs about 800 people.
General Dynamics yesterday confirmed that Kuwait had signalled its intention
to buy 236 of its M1A2 Abrams tanks. Details were still to be negotiated. It
would not comment on allegations of administration pressure on Kuwait but
said it welcomed any US official support.
According to several reports, Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary,
wrote to the Kuwaiti authorities stressing the importance of the deal for
continued US military aid in the region.
Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, said he was 'not in any way
critical' of the British government's role.
The company had received full backing from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence
secretary, who visited Kuwait last month, and Mr John Major, the prime
minister, had expressed a personal interest in the deal.
The Ministry of Defence said yesterday: 'We share in the disappointment.'
Last year Vickers won a British government contract worth Pounds 500m to
produce 140 Challenger 2s, partly on the strength of the tank's export
prospects.
Sir Colin said he believed Vickers was able to offer Kuwait a lower price
than General Dynamics. It had submitted its bid only last week and was not
expecting a decision until next month. 'We've not even discussed our price
with them,' he said.
General Dynamics said results from Kuwaiti trials earlier this year would
show that the Abrams 'outperformed Challenger in every category'. The trials
focused on mobility, firepower and engineering.
Sir Colin said, however, that the Kuwaitis initially appeared to be
'favourably impressed' by the Challenger. The company thought it had done
'quite well' in firing trials.
Vickers claims Challenger, although slower on the ground, has the edge in
crew protection and in maintenance costs.
Losing the Kuwaiti contract is the second upset for the Challenger 2 after
its exclusion from a competition in Sweden for a similar-sized order.
Production work on the UK Challenger order, due to last until 1998, would
not on its own be enough to sustain the two plants, Sir Colin said.
The most immediate export prospect is Oman, which is seeking about 60 tanks.
But Vickers would need a larger contract - either from Saudi Arabia, which
is in the market for more than 200 tanks, or the United Arab Emirates, which
is set to buy 390.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Deadline on VAT change nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of thousands of companies throughout Europe must urgently complete
radical changes in the way they handle value added tax if they are to meet
the January 1 deadline for creation of the European single market.
Many companies will not have enough time to modify internal information
systems and alter computer systems, tax specialists said. They may be forced
to carry out large numbers of VAT calculations manually, hire scarce
information technology consultants or employ external computer bureaux at
extra cost.
The new VAT rules have been devised to take account of the abolition of
border controls which will mean that customs officers will no longer monitor
shipments at border posts. The responsibility for reporting VAT liability
and recording trade statistics will be shifted to companies themselves.
The new rules are intended as a first step in a move from levying VAT on
imports to imposing the tax on exports. The change-over is due to be
completed in 1997. It affects only trade between European Community member
states so businesses dealing with other countries will have to operate two
sets of VAT procedures.
Accountants report considerable resistance from many of their clients to
making preparations for the VAT changes. Part of the reluctance stems from
the fact that the new EC legislation has not been finalised and last-minute
changes may still be made.
Business organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry and the
Institute of Directors in the UK, the French Patronat and the German
employers' association, BDI, are concerned that the new VAT rules will
impose a heavy bureaucratic burden on business with few corresponding
benefits.
'It is a horribly complex system,' said Mr Adrian Ogley, a tax specialist at
the CBI. 'Tax is not glamorous politically so it has been left to the
administrators from the 12 member states and business has not had much
input.'
The abolition of border tax controls is expected to lead to savings of up to
Pounds 10bn, according to one estimate. But business organisations fear that
much of this will be offset by the costs of adjusting to the new VAT
regulations.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Perot flies high after debate as Bush comes out loser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's uphill struggle to be re-elected looked even tougher
yesterday as he was widely judged to have given the poorest performance in
the first televised US presidential debate on Sunday night.
Three of four overnight polls proclaimed Mr Ross Perot, the independent, as
the 'winner,' followed by Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate,
who was reckoned to have done best in the fourth poll. Mr Bush trailed badly
in all of them.
But Mr Perot's typically rambunctious and humorous act did not appear to
make him a more credible threat to his opponents. Translated into voting
preferences, two surveys found him rising to the 12-14 per cent range, with
Mr Clinton gaining a point or two to 46-47 per cent and Mr Bush losing
between 3 and 6 points to 31-35 per cent.
Apart from the mini-movement towards Mr Perot, probably a greater threat to
Mr Bush than to Mr Clinton, most respondents said their minds had not been
changed by the debate. With three weeks to go to election day this must
delight the Democrats and distress the Republicans.
The debate was seen as crucial for Mr Bush to turn the tide. His spin
doctors said he had done well, but he elicited no measurable mistake from Mr
Clinton during the mannerly evening.
In the sharpest exchange between the two, Mr Clinton invoked Mr Bush's
father, the late Senator Prescott Bush, as a fighter against the McCarthyite
tactics which, he claimed, Mr Bush was using over his role in organising
demonstrations in London against the Vietnam war 23 years ago.
Mr Bush was not helped by the fact that most of Mr Perot's barbs were
directed his way. When the president proclaimed the virtues of his own
experience, Mr Perot quipped: 'I don't have any experience in running up a
four trillion dollar debt.'
The surprise of the evening came when Mr Bush said he wanted Mr James Baker,
who switched from secretary of state to head the White House staff in
August, to run the economy in a second term. But a campaign spokesman said
Mr Bush was referring to the period between election and inauguration.

FT  13 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The steadiness of Trafalgar House shares in response to the result of the
Hongkong Land tender prompts the question of whether there is a floor around
85p. The answer is only a qualified yes. The wholesale rejection of the
tender by institutional investors suggests they think the company is worth
more. If Trafalgar House fails to appoint a board capable of unlocking that
value, then, presumably, Land will eventually be back in part or in full.
That said, one should beware of assuming the company can be turned round
quickly or that the fortunes of the engineering and construction industries
are at their nadir. Just because Trafalgar's assets are worth more than 85p
per share now does not automatically mean they still will be in 12 months'
time.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, may be forgiven for feeling
depressed that the Kuwaiti tank order has gone to the US. Whatever the
political shenanigans behind the decision, it highlights the risks of
relying on the defence business. Vickers needs another order for its
Challenger 2 tank in the next 18 months, and Kuwait was one of its best
opportunities. Oman or Saudi Arabia may yet come up trumps, but no decisions
will be made there until well into next year.
The cash injection from an order would have come in handy. Rolls-Royce
Motors has been sucking cash out of the business and gearing has risen
uncomfortably, limiting Vickers' room for manoeuvre. If BMW were still
interested in acquiring part or all of Rolls, it might feel the price has
just fallen.

FT  13 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: BAA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA can afford to observe Dan-Air's struggle for survival from the
comfortable position of a near-monopoly supplier. It is unlikely that
Dan-Air attracts many passengers who would otherwise not fly, as Laker
Airlines did in the 1970s, so there is not much of a threat to overall air
traffic volumes. Dan-Air's charter commitments could be met by other
carriers, and most would fly from BAA airports. Some scheduled landing slots
at Gatwick might remain unfilled - as happened following the collapse of Air
Europe - but the busy routes would be snapped up. There is limited risk of a
bad debt charge, even if the worst does come to the worst.
The loss of Gatwick's second largest customer would dent hopes of developing
that airport into a serious hub for scheduled business travel. Gatwick has
been losing out to Heathrow since air traffic control restrictions were
liberalised last year, as yesterday's traffic figures show. Annual growth at
Heathrow is 6 per cent, against 2 per cent at Gatwick. But since charges are
higher at Heathrow, why should BAA care?
Perhaps because another failure at Gatwick would have a knock-on effect on
Stansted, London's third airport, which is still some way from break-even.
It looks increasingly as though the Pounds 400m recently invested there will
take longer than expected to produce a return.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps it was lack of incisiveness in the Treasury select committee
questions. Perhaps the chancellor remains unexcited by open discussion of
economic policy after all. Perhaps the authorities still do not have
coherent ideas on policy. Whatever the reason, Mr Lamont's answers yesterday
scarcely left the markets any wiser. Without clear economic criteria,
short-run policy decisions will probably continue to depend mainly on
politics.
True, one could read into Mr Lamont's remarks an indication that a rate cut
is in the offing. Inflation, he noted, is a lagging indicator. So the fact
that the UK is only just inside this particular target may not matter. The
chancellor also focused on the exchange rate which has conveniently rallied
since last week. Yet there is less immediate political imperative to cut
rates now the party conference is over. The authorities may prefer to give
the market more time to savour the prospect. After all, they can hardly
afford to spark another precipitate fall of sterling by cutting too hastily.
One might expect the emphasis on the effective exchange rate index to create
a little additional leeway. In fact, since Black Wednesday sterling has
fallen by just under 10 per cent against both the D-Mark and in terms of the
effective index. So the choice of yardstick has little immediate relevance,
and looks designed as a sop to those who want nothing more to do with the
ERM. It may narrow the government's freedom of manoeuvre next year, however,
if, as many expect, the dollar starts to appreciate significantly against
all European currencies.

FT  13 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Lucas hits the brakes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas has been looking optimistically over the horizon for economic recovery
almost since the recession started. Yesterday's annual figures finally
included an Pounds 84m restructuring package, but Lucas still seems to take
the notion that an upturn will cure its basic ills. The management talks of
aiming to pay the full Pounds 49m dividend from operating earnings in
1992-93, when in the year just past it came entirely from reserves. Given
that the company admits the first six months are unlikely to be much better
than 1991-92, that implies quite a turnaround in the second half.
Cash is also a headache. When the company scooped up its Pounds 90m windfall
from the pension fund last year, it expected gearing to fall from 40 per
cent to below 30 per cent. It is now 44 per cent. The new finance director,
Mr John Grant, will have to get a firm grip on working capital to prevent
gearing rising further. The new programme for disposing of non-core
businesses may not produce much by the way of profits above book value. It
is probably more important that it will bring in cash.
Perhaps comparison with the likes of GKN, which battened down the hatches
early in the recession, is a little unfair. Lucas has good products too, but
its markets may be more competitive. Capital spending is needed to keep up.
Nonetheless, a poor long-term record for cash generation is just the type of
problem the likes of BTR enjoy sorting out. Unless Lucas addresses the issue
itself, it may find that keeping shareholders sweet with their own money is
not enough.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (4): Tangled web of
interchange unravels - The Technologies, OSI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU can die of boredom sitting in a standards meeting week in week out,'
says Mr Mark O'Neill. He should know. As a strategy chief at the Department
of Trade and Industry he is responsible for getting the UK business
community interested in the implementation of Open Systems Interconnection
(OSI).
OSI offers a complicated seven-layer model of communications protocols.
These should ensure a seamless exchange of information across computers from
different suppliers. And the Government OSI Profile (Gosip) is aims to
simplify the tangled world of OSI protocols.
'We try and reduce the sheer number of options available to people by
focusing on those areas of direct use and interest to people,' he says.
Mr O'Neill and his team at the DTI's Millbank Tower have concentrated the
world of OSI into manageable chunks.
OSI base standards for local area networks contain detail on the
co-efficiency of the wrapping applied to electrical cable. Mr O'Neill that
thinks the end-user can be spared such fine print.
'You find yourself with a 300-page document, and that is not realistic for
the end-user. Gosip reduces it all to something simple.' Gosip has whittled
the 400 options contained in the OSI model down to 12 essentials.
Although it is a government sponsored initiative, Gosip aims to lead the
commercial sector. 'We don't just sit in Millbank and make it up,' says Mr
O'Neill, 'because we want to do what people want we built feedback into the
process.'
Computer suppliers have been quick to hitch their own standards groups to
the official bodies and have good incentives for keeping abreast of
standards. 'The government backing for OSI is driving us as suppliers,' says
Mr Simon Goodwin, connectivity manager at NCR in London. A user base in
local and national government obliges NCR to sign up.
Suppliers have done more than ape the OSI line. They have set up a parallel
bureaucracy. EurOSInet brings together representatives of the leading
vendors in meetings around Europe. Companies nominate one European office to
represent their perspective on evolving standards. Internal documents make
it plain that active participation in maintaining common European standards
is commercially vital.
NCR's Copenhagen office is responsible for briefing the rest of the
organisation on the significance of a European procurement standard. It
characterises the OSI market in stark terms: '320m people, a yearly spending
on IT equipment in the Dollars 100bn size.'
Enter the EC and a new acronym. European Procurement Handbook for Open
Systems, Ephos, is the Brussels answer to Gosip. It is serious. 'In order to
sell in Europe NCR must deliver products that follow the procurement
standards or be able to justify why the NCR approach is better.' This is NCR
Copenhagen's line on Ephos.
Ephos owes its existence to a 1987 EC directive that sought to include IT
systems in the single market boat. On March 26 this year, 200
representatives of standards bodies gathered in Brussels to push the Ephos
boat out.
The message was that Europeans could establish IT procurement standards on a
par with the rigid US government rules. The list of attendees sounds like a
lost language. Ositop, Spag, Ewos and OSTC were among the acronyms
celebrated.
Where does Ephos leave Gosip? Some observers of the standards scene are
cynical about the proliferation of OSI committees.
One source close to the DTI claims that commercial realities seem to have
taken a back seat in the round of meetings between the two.
An industry observer uncharitably characterises the Gosip/Ephos interface as
'the bleeding edge'.
'Ephos promises a level playing field for suppliers across Europe,' says Mr
O'Neill, stressing the cordial relations Gosip staff enjoy with their near
neighbours in Ephos. 'We fully support the Ephos initiative. There is some
repetition of work, but not as much as you'd think.'
Mr Colin Tulley is on the IT planning group at Trafalgar House. It is his
lot to translate the work of EC and DTI standards bodies into useful tools
for a conglomerate that embraces shipping, engineering and construction
interests. He displays a refreshingly practical attitude. 'We've said we'll
support the Gosip profile where possible but we'll go outside the guidelines
if there's a business argument for doing so.'
One of the key features of OSI is X400. This is a communications protocol
that provides a common electronic mail vehicle for the internal networks of
large organisations. Trafalgar House has implemented X400. Mr Tulley speaks
of the achievement with a mix of surprise and pride. 'We've actually got
X400 up and running. Trafalgar House has a plethora of different computer
systems and X400 is a flexible E-mail based vehicle for outside clients
too.'
John Brown Engineering is an arm of Trafalgar House that has pioneered OSI.
Documents, images and drawings are the stuff of its precision engineering
business. These articles need to be transported internationally. 'The idea
is to exchange technical drawings, to update and come to agreement readily,'
says Mr Tulley. The means is X400.
OSI compliance has meant a modest investment for Trafalgar House so far. A
Hewlett-Packard Unix machine to run the Open Mail X400 product cost around
Pounds 40,000. As the John Brown project expands, one or two more of these
machines will be dedicated to communications.
But pricing out a communications strategy is not a high priority. 'There
probably isn't an identifiable tangible payback for this kind of
technology,' says Mr Tulley, 'The point is that it helps you service your
customers more effectively.'
From the John Brown pilot, Trafalgar House plans to expand the reach of its
OSI products via a private network that will link every operation in the
group. Mr Tulley is at pains to underline the commercial reality behind the
conglomerate's attachment to the DTI's favourite protocol.
'We have a sceptical view, freedom to choose suppliers is our motive, in an
ideal world we want to switch from hardware platform to platform with ease.'
Mr Tulley welcomes Gosip as a cut-down version of OSI that allows the user
to choose which options he wishes to support. But he claims many standards
are open to interpretation and says a full scale implementation of OSI is
impractical. 'It takes up too much room on the machine and that's the
penalty you pay for having standards built by a committee.' Such instinctive
dislike of officialdom may be the grand design's biggest handicap.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (5): E-mail moves
away from mainframes - Emma Woollacott finds local area networks are now
playing host to electronic message systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA WOOLLACOTT

<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC mail is changing fast. A few years ago, it was largely the
preserve of mainframe-based systems, and notoriously difficult to install
and manage. But nowadays an increasing number of large corporates are
downsizing to local area networks and are phasing out host-based e-mail
systems in favour of LAN systems.
Mr Mark Hassall, Microsoft's product marketing manager for Mail 3.0, says:
'LAN-based e-mail can give all the things people were looking for in
mainframe systems.
But users of things like Profs and All-in-One are paying exorbitant
maintenance fees. There's a 10-to-one ratio between those costs and the
costs of a LAN system'.
BP Oil has recently switched from a mainframe-based environment towards Unix
and PCs.
Mr James Cunningham, project leader at BP, says: 'It was particularly
attractive in the early days to our European associates, where it would be
less easy to justify the cost of huge pipes to tap into an IBM mainframe.'
LAN e-mail packages have also become more secure and flexibility and
connectivity are improving. The main suppliers are beginning to introduce
global naming, a feature which allows every server on a wide area network to
distribute a list of all its users to every other server.
This feature already exists in Banyan's Vines system, and will be included
in Novell's next release of NetWare, NetWare 4.0, early next year. Combined
with suitable gateway connections to other messaging systems, it allows a
server route to make calls right across a WAN.
There are now approximately 10m e-mail users worldwide, of whom around half
are using a PC LAN-based system. Figures from market researcher Romtec
suggest that some 90,000 UK users hooked up to a new PC-based e-mail system
during the first half of this year. This makes e-mail one of the
fastest-growing software areas and one which is winning a lot of attention
from suppliers.
The most important innovation is the emergence of the mail-enabled
application. Whereas sending a mail message currently involves calling up
the e-mail program separately, and creating a text-only message, in future
'Mail' will simply be a menu option in virtually any program, similar to the
'Print' command.
Users will be able to create a spreadsheet in Excel, for instance, and mail
it to any other user running Excel on the network, adding comments, graphs,
even sound. Gateways will allow messages to be sent from PC to Mac to Unix
workstation, even a fax machine.
Mr Gavin Lennox, Lotus' product marketing manager for cc:Mail, describes a
demonstration where sales reps used pen-based portable PCs out in the field
to fill in electronic forms and then sent the information back to the office
LAN instantly, using a wide area radio network, where it was automatically
routed and processed.
This type of application takes the emphasis away from simple messaging and
into the area of workgroup computing, where groups of users can work
collaboratively on shared information. E-mail conferencing becomes possible.
Work flow can be automated so that, for example, an electronically-created
expenses form can be filtered by the system and automatically routed to a
manager for approval if the total exceeds a certain amount.
Mr Allan Paterson, director of planning and control at Bass Breweries, is in
the process of introducing Microsoft Mail throughout the organisation. Over
6,000 users worldwide will be added to the system over the next two years,
and there will also be gateways to the e-mail systems of the company's
principal customers and suppliers.
'It's improving productivity already,' he said. 'And in the last couple of
weeks we've put it on the most senior desks, and we've found once they've
tried it people are asking 'can you put it into my home?', or 'can you add
such and such a person?' A me-too attitude soon builds up.'
The snag in this vision of collaborative working is in the lack of a
standard covering how the mail-enabled applications communicate with the
messaging back-end, and how that back-end controls the addressing and
routing of calls.
Many mini and mainframe e-mail systems, in particular, make no distinction
between the application and the back-end.
In fact, few of the several hundred e-mail 'standards' currently in
existence even agree on the definition of a message, let alone a common way
of addressing and routing calls.
Standards body CCITT has published a messaging standard, X400, but suppliers
have found this so limiting that they have tended to implement their own
versions of it, leading to a distinct lack of compatibility. Novell's
Message Handling Service (MHS) has become something of a de facto standard
for communication between different LANs, and is supported by most e-mail
suppliers, but up to now there has been no standard way of mail-enabling
applications.
Until now, each e-mail transport system has had a different API and software
developers have had to produce different versions accordingly.
Two groups of suppliers have taken it on themselves to put an end to this
confusion by producing a standard for writing applications programming
interfaces (APIs) to allow developers to mail-enable applications.
Microsoft is pushing the Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI),
and has support from Digital Equipment Corp (DEC), Basnyan Systems,
Hewlett-Packard and others.
Meanwhile Lotus, Apple, Borland and IBM have teamed up to produce the Vendor
Independent Messaging (VIM) standard. Novell is a member of both camps, and
has promised that it will adapt MHS to support both.
Users have pressed each group to include support for the other's standard,
but so far with little success.
The best bet for compatibility is the fact that both MAPI and VIM have been
submitted to the X400 API Association, which is expected to produce a
compromise Common Application Call Set in the near future.
Once this happens, mail-enabling can really take off in earnest, although
this won't happen overnight. Both Microsoft and the VIM consortium will take
some time to bring their APIs into line, and the chances are that, just as
with the original X400 standard, developers will add their own elements.
And until a true mail-enabling standard emerges, users will be restricted to
packages from either Microsoft or the main VIM members.
As Lotus' Mr Lennox says, 'both groups are in around the same position - and
that's close to the starting block'.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (2): User and service
divide - Client-server technology permits more flexible applications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE client-server model separates information technology systems into users
(clients) and services (servers) and meets a rising demand for cheaper, more
flexible and more responsive applications.
'Client-server technology will affect large segments of suppliers and users
and client-server products will account for some 23 per cent of the software
products market by 1996,' says market researcher Ovum in its 1991 report
'Client-Server Computing: Commercial Strategies'.
The client-server model provides an economical way to distribute computer
power, while maintaining the controls associated with centralised computing.
It takes advantage of the lower costs of open, component-based systems and
the trend towards industry-wide standards in software and communications.
Client-server systems use standard software and communications networks to
distribute functions across multiple computers with different operating
software. Powerful personal workstations, with advanced graphical user
interfaces and local processing power (the clients), sit at the front end.
Special-purpose 'servers' - providing services such as shared printing,
communications links and database storage - are available, through the
network, to workstations.
So far the client-server approach has been used mainly for database
applications. Using an IBM-designed standard called SQL, client workstations
are able to send complex requests for data to remote server computers.
But the past year has seen moves to broaden the appeal of the client-server
approach and use it for more traditional data processing applications -
particularly those which involve transaction processing.
Database suppliers such as Sybase, Oracle, Informix and Ingres have been in
forefront and have placed increasing emphasis on the transaction processing
features of their database products.
At the end of September IBM announced a version of its popular CICS
transaction processing software which uses the client-server approach. It is
based on AIX, its version of the Unix operating system, and runs on IBM's
RS/6000 workstation computer.
CICS is, perhaps, IBM most successful software product with over 33,000
sites worldwide. It is the market leader by a wide margin and IBM's decision
to move it to an open environment and re-engineer it to use the
client-server model is important.
IBM's announcement came in response to a trend towards the use of open
systems as a base for transaction processing applications. The use of the
client-server model provides an appropriate infrastructure for complexities
associated with transaction processing in modern computing environments,
which can be based on a variety of hardware and operating systems from
different manufacturers.
Traditionally, transaction processing applications have been based on
single-supplier, proprietary computer systems such as IBM's System 370
mainframe.
Until recently, proprietary systems were the only systems which could
provide the infrastructure to cover security of access, data integrity and
disaster recovery.
IBM's decision to move CICS into an open environment - backed up by an
unprecedented policy to licence CICS to other manufacturers - comes against
a background of important activity in the transaction processing area.
Computer suppliers see transaction processing as an important factor in
promoting the cause of open systems. Many companies rely on transaction
processing as the base for important online operational tasks such as
accounting and customer service support.
If open systems are to continue expanding, they must be able to cope with
complex transaction processing and, in the past two years, the standards
infrastructure has grown to include the mechanisms to make this possible.
The IBM-backed Open Software Foundation (OSF), for example, has published a
standard for distributed computing which covers this. It includes a
technique called the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) which can pass the complex
messages through a network, regardless of the operating environment or
computer hardware. IBM's new version of CICS uses the RPC to allow it to
work across different systems.
But IBM is not alone in seeing the advantages of offering open systems
transaction processing. Hewlett Packard announced that it would licence
IBM's open CICS software, hard on the heels of the IBM announcement and
other key manufacturers are expected to follow suit. Both Stratus - which
already has strong links with IBM - and Sun Microsystems have been suggested
as possible future CICS licensees.
Meanwhile Unix International, a rival faction in the open systems market,
has put its weight behind an alternative transaction processing system,
Tuxedo. This again uses the client-server model of computing to provide
support for transaction processing in a mixed environment.
One of Tuxedo's main sponsors is the Japanese-owned, UK-based manufacturer
ICL, which uses Tuxedo on its Unix-based computers. Mr Nicholas Connor,
marketing manager for distributed information systems at ICL, says the
future of open client-server systems is tied closely to transaction
processing.
'Client-server systems will grow more complicated and will need to be
transaction-based,' he says.
'A simple business requirement, like, say, adding a new employee, generates
several transactions. One to update the payroll file, one to up date
employee file, one to update the pension file and so on. The business
requirement is for a single transaction - but current systems demand many
different entries. Tuxedo provides the mechanisms with which to enter it
just once and then distribute it automatically through the system,' he says.
Mr Connor suggests that this sort feature will give companies the
opportunity to improve customer service too.
'The introduction of a new telephone subscriber or a new client for a bank
poses the same problem. Automatic transaction processing and distribution
would enable them to improve their service to customers. In the current
economic climate this is obviously very important,' he says.
Although Tuxedo and IBM's CICS look set to compete with each other in the
market for open transaction processing systems, they could end up
co-operating. Tuxedo is able to work with CICS systems already and IBM has
announced that a version of Tuxedo will be available for its mainframe
computers - running with its AIX/Unix - next year.
Either way, transaction processing in an open client-server environment
looks set to become a big issue for suppliers and users of computers across
the industry.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (3): Fending off the
fraudsters - Security Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPEN systems have been portrayed by almost all in the computer industry as
'a good thing' - but they have also made life more difficult for those who
design security systems for computer systems.
In a true open system - where systems from different manufacturers can
connect with one another - the security of the whole system is no weaker
than the weakest link in the chain. The weakest of those links has
traditionally been the personal computer.
The PC was originally designed as a personal productivity tool - only one
person was expected to use it and few considered the possibility that
crucial corporate data would ever appear on its screens. The PC was
something you would use to do word-processing, a little spreadsheet work and
perhaps keep electronic versions of your address book.
Today's PC is far more powerful and is used for all manner of applications -
many of which involve 'networking' these PCs together with one another as
well as with minicomputer and mainframe systems. For this reason, PC
industry local area network (LAN) market leader Novell has had to serious
come to grips with implementing credible data security technology.
According to Novell UK spokesman Mr Dominic Storey, many companies do not
think about LAN security. He said a recent survey suggested few companies
conducted risk analysis, developed security guidelines, set up security
configurations, co-ordinated security training or periodically reviewed
security compliance for the networked PCs.
'LANs are basically distributed multi-user computer systems and, as such,
have similar security requirements,' he says. 'The computer needs to be
protected from physical damage, the software programs from virus attack and
the data from accidental or intentional damage.'
He says that the advent of viruses make the PC much more prone to breaches
of security than minicomputer systems or mainframes - and therefore sensible
precautions must be taken.
'Virus detection can be performed by specialised programs which look for
sequences within program code,' explains Mr Storey. 'No virus detection
program is foolproof, as new viruses are created on a distressingly regular
basis. The best form of cure is prevention - and to do this, users must be
discouraged from uploading suspect software or else have their rights
restricted to prevent virus contagion.'
One of the other keys to building a secure PC network lies in the features
contained in the network operating system - such as Novell's NetWare. It
starts with the 'log-in' password, which must be entered every time a user
starts working on the network.
Passwords under NetWare are stored in special files on the file server
called 'bindery' files. Within these files, all user passwords are stored in
encrypted form using a one-way or 'trap-door' encryption function. When a
user logs in, the password is never seen. Instead, a special code (called a
key) is passed to the PC. The PC uses the password to encrypt the key, and
the encrypted key is passed back to the server.
Passwords under NetWare must also be of a minimum length (thus reducing the
statistical chances of a hacker guessing them) and can be 'force-changed' by
the network administrator, must be unique (so that no two users have the
same password).
Most network system also allow network administrators to specify which
system features each user will have access to. These can limit the times of
the day the system can be used, the amount of time, the amount of disk space
they use and the way they use dial-in 'modems'.
Mr Storey says that PC networks also need to offer an 'audit trail' of their
use. He admits that NetWare is still not ideal in this respect. 'No security
system is perfect; it is essential to log information, so that a security
compromise can be traced,' he says.
'System audit information is available in a limited form for NetWare and
will be extended to full file system audit in future releases. At present
various logs are stored - the error log logs all hardware and system errors,
and account information (bindery logs) can be generated using a supervisor
utility.'
In the end, however, security on PC networks is all about using common
sense. And that means instituting company-wide procedures for PCs in the
same way as for minicomputer and mainframe systems.
'To maintain good standards of security, companies should employ tried and
tested authentication procedures,' says Mr Storey. 'Use of initial passwords
during account generation ensures that new accounts do not represent a
security hole. Use of existing security features make a system which is
flexible to the user, yet secure.
'If implementing a secure system with high expectations of data integrity,
lock the file server away. A system will never be truly secure while the
file server is easily accessible.
Above all, train users to think securely. Make sure, for example, that they
use hard to guess passwords and do not place the password under the desk.
This will reduce the possibility of user ignorance leading to unexpected
security compromises.'

FT  13 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Think-tank urges energy
conservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RUSSIAN think-tank yesterday warned against throwing money at Russia's
ailing oil and gas industry without tough energy conservation measures and
savage structural reforms to privatise or close down loss-making
enterprises.
The report, produced for the Russian Foreign Policy Foundation by experts
including Mr Andrei Konoplyannik, a deputy energy minister, also lays great
stress on the need for energy conservation, saying that 40 per cent of
energy produced in 1991 had been wasted. While national output had fallen by
7.5 per cent, oil consumption had decreased by only 2 per cent. Expectations
that resources would be freed up for additional exports had also proven
unfounded.
It forecast that oil production this year would fall to 380m tonnes, an even
gloomier figure than the 398m tonne estimate by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
deputy prime minister responsible for energy policy. Although the gas sector
is generally considered more stable than oil, production could fall 10 to 12
per cent over the next year after showing no growth in 1991 unless urgent
(but unspecified) action was taken.
While stressing the importance of foreign capital both for Russia's oil and
gas industry, and the West, which would promote secure supplies and
stability within Russia, the report says that foreign investment which
focussed exclusively on oil production would be a catastrophe. Unless
foreign capital flowed to a broad range of sectors (including conservation),
oil reserves would be rapidly exhausted without sufficient compensation for
the country as a whole.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Safety fears may force closure
of Ekofisk tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORWEGIAN Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, is
considering an order to close the main processing and transportation
facilities on the tank in the giant 10-platform Ekofisk field by the winter
of 1995-96 for safety reasons.
Phillips Petroleum Norway is the operator of Ekofisk, a major part of the
world's biggest oil and gas transportation system, and holds a 37 per cent
stake in the field. Petrofina holds a 30 per cent stake and Agip has 13 per
cent.
Oil is processed and transported via Ekofisk to Teesside, England, and gas
to Emden, Germany. Mr Jan Hagland, an NPD official, said that about 40 per
cent of Norway's petroleum production was transported via Ekofisk
facilities.
The directorate said ageing technical equipment combined with inadequate
maintenance were the main causes for its concern and that subsidence of the
field had contributed to a worsening of the situation. It added that studies
carried out by Phillips also revealed safety-related deficiencies on the
installation.
Phillips and its partners have three weeks to reply to the NPD, which said
that further modifications to facilities would not sufficiently compensate
for continued deterioration in the situation.
Mr Hagland said the NPD thought there was time for Phillips and other
licence holders to establish new, similar capacity to avoid permanent
closure of the field.
In 1987 Phillips and partners invested NKr4bn (Pounds 395m) to jack up the
steel platforms in the field's centre to secure them against the
consequences of subsidence, which is thought to be caused by a drop in the
pressure in the field's two reservoirs.
In 1989 a protective concrete wall was installed around the Ekofisk tank to
enhance safety, and a major water injection project is under way to increase
recoverable reserves beyond the year 2011, when the group's licence in the
field expires.
Phillips said it was studying changes to the existing Ekofisk processing and
transportation system and to this end would respond to the NPD within the
stipulated period.
The oil ministry, which oversees licensing of fields, has not yet received a
request from Phillips to extend its licence beyond the year 2011, but
analysts said this would be necessary if the group was to make significant
investments to meet the NPD's demands.

TIN came under heavy selling pressure on the London Metal Exchange. The
market slumped to five-month lows at the close and further declines seem
likely. Persistent liquidation, and merchant and Chinese selling meant there
were very few buyers, dealers said. Available supplies are more than
adequate to meet current depressed demand, and physical market premiums have
contracted recently. Charts are weak and the next major objective is Dollars
5,800 a tonne for three-month metal. NICKEL was also in retreat, dropping to
new 32-month lows. Dealers said lack of significant production cuts and
plentiful supplies of Russian metal in Europe continued to weigh on the
market. COPPER closed above earlier lows, but showed little inclination to
rally, given sluggish fundamentals and expectations of further stock rises.
ALUMINIUM edged away from earlier lows in late trading on some option-linked
buying, although the market remained easier as consumers were unwilling to
chase three-month metal up to Dollars 1,200 a tonne.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold tumbles while US backs are
turned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN SPECULATORS chose the US Columbus Day holiday for a relatively
successful attempt to drive down the gold price, traders and analysts
suggested. Gold closed in London at Dollars 345.80 a troy ounce, down
Dollars 5.05 from Friday's close.
Although the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) was open, speculators knew
it would be thinly-manned because of the holiday.
'It was the one day when Europe could sell without Comex buying in the
afternoon,' suggested one trader.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of the Banque
Bruxelles Lambert group, suggested that 'because they (the speculators)
failed recently to push the gold price up through resistance at Dollars 352
(an ounce), they decided to push the other way'.
The Europeans hoped to spark selling by the US funds, she added, and some
funds did liquidate their holdings. But the gold market fundamentals were
sound, Ms O'Connell insisted, and yesterday's fall was 'just professionals
having some fun and games'.
Traders suggested the volume of gold traded yesterday was not large although
some producer selling from South Africa and Australia took place as the
price began to fall. The pace of gold's fall was also accelerated when some
funds cut their losses at the Dollars 348 level.
Some gold producers, notably Newmont Mining of the US, have recently unwound
their forward sales and hedging, gestures meant to signal they were
confident the price did not have much further to fall.
However, American Barrick Resources, the Canadian group, announced at the
weekend it had completed a 1m-ounce, ten-year gold hedging facility that
allowed it to receive Dollars 450 an ounce for gold sold forward under spot
deferred contracts.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, suggested that this
news may not have helped the market psychologically.
He suggested that the uncertainties associated with the US presidential
election might help the gold price in the next few weeks, 'but after that
you can't be too optimistic'.
Ms O'Connell said that Dollars 345.50 was an important chart resistance
point for gold and if the price broke through that level it might go to
Dollars 343.
Some traders went even further and suggested a fall below Dollars 345.50
might trigger substantial liquidation of US fund holdings and a drop to
Dollars 338 an ounce.
At Dollars 350 an ounce about one third of gold production outside the
former eastern bloc is unprofitable, SG Warburg Securities, the financial
services group, points out in its latest International Mining Outlook.
It is forecasting 'only modest price improvement and volatility over the
next two years'. Warburg suggests the gold price will average Dollars 345 an
ounce this year, move up to Dollars 370 in the first half of 1993 and to
Dollars 380 in the second half.

RUSSIA'S OIL industry, second in size only to that of Saudi Arabia, is on
the verge of a major reorganisation that could admit more private
investment. Last week Russian oil industry and government officials approved
the draft of a plan to restructure the oil sector into a handful of
vertically integrated joint-stock companies under the aegis of a single
super-trust, tentatively named Rosneft.
According to the programme, which still has to be approved by Boris Yeltsin,
the Russian president, Russia's 40-odd self-financing oil producing groups
would be marshalled into a limited number of integrated 'well-to-pump'
trusts by December 1. A controlling packet of 49 per cent of the shares in
each trust would be placed in the hands of Rosneft, allowing the government
to retain effective control.
'It is impossible not to worry that the momentum for change will be lost
during the transitional period the programme outlines,' said Mr Peter
Cameron, a European energy expert who was in Moscow to hold a workshop for
Russian oil and gas specialists.
The draft programme, which stipulates that foreign and domestic private
investors may purchase shares in the new trusts, is being billed in Russia
as a three-year transitional step which would prepare the oil industry for
more far-reaching privatisation.
However, the immediate effect of the plan would be to beef up centralised
control and curb the autonomy Russian oil producers, most of them in distant
Siberia, have enjoyed in the chaotic months since the collapse of the Soviet
Union. According to the draft plan, the government would guide overall
policy, control exports, and have the right to block take-overs. Rosneft,
the super-trust, would not have the right to dispose of its shares.
'The repercussions of radical change are frankly frightening them,' said Mr
Cameron, citing the Russian government's fear of unemployment, higher prices
and a dilution of central authority. 'This may be the best that they can do
for the moment.'
For Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, deputy prime minister responsible for the
petroleum sector, the programme represents a delicate balancing act between
Siberia's powerful oil barons and Moscow's Fuel and Energy Ministry.
'By no means should we impose it (the program),' he told journalists. 'The
principle is that it must profit the producers and the whole country.'
The Russian oil industry, potentially an engine for economic recovery, is
collapsing almost as quickly as the rest of the economy.
Figures published over the weekend in Delovoy Mir, a Russian business
newspaper, indicate that oil output fell by 14 per cent in the first eight
months of the year and the government predicts that in 1992 Russia will
average 8m barrels a day, down 1m b/d from 1991.
Moreover, western investors have been wary of Russia, preferring the warm
welcome and clear lines of command in other former Soviet republics such as
Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.
'It is remarkable that a country with as much oil and gas as Russia cannot
conclude a single major contract with a big Western company,' said Mr
Cameron. He said that western oil men were reluctant to finalise deals in
Russia because of uncertainty about who actually controlled the oil wells.
The reorganisation of the oil industry into trusts might open a window of
opportunity for western investors, but Mr Cameron predicted that they could
be reluctant to commit substantial funds into companies in which the
government retained a dominant voice.
Mr Cameron said that the promotion of 54-year-old Mr. Chernomyrdin, who won
a reputation as a tough manager in his days as the head of Russia's gas
monopoly, to the top job in the Fuel and Energy Ministry, had strengthened
the hand of the conservatives.
'There are indications of a growing conservatism (in the oil industry),
based on social and political concerns rather than economic ones,' he said.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Bush seems
the lesser evil to US growers - Fear of runaway environmentalism is likely
to outweigh dissatisfaction with the president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON

<TEXT>
VIRGINIAN CROP farmers are generally speaking rather 'laid back'; at least
they are when they discuss the size of their crops. They become quite
animated when they turn to sport but I was not in the US last week to talk
about ball games.
All of the farmers I visited were busy combine harvesting corn, or maize as
we call it in the UK. Most crops were yielding exceptionally well and even
my most reticent hosts admitted to bringing in more than five tonnes an acre
(12.5 tonnes a hectare). But the only sign of satisfaction was the
occasional lazy smile followed by a remark to the effect that the big crops
were causing storage problems.
These are the kinds of problems farmers dream about, and it was as clear as
the leaves on the trees that cloak the slopes of the magnificent Shenandoah
that those who farmed the land between them were moderately optimistic, in
spite of the troubled US economy.
Harvest has not been as good across the whole of the US, however. Some
dry-land wheat areas once again had severe drought conditions during a
crucial period in the growing season and crops in those states were
disappointing. The total US yield of what this year has, in fact, been
estimated at about the same as last year's and carryover stocks remain
tight. It was announced some time ago that there would be no land set-aside
requirement for US wheat growers in 1993.
American maize, on the other hand, seems set to yield 30m to 35m tonnes more
than last year at 220m to 225m tonnes and stocks will be increased
significantly. In spite of this some US grain exporters pleaded with Mr Ed
Madigan, the agriculture secretary, of not to impose set-aside on the crop
next year on the grounds that world demand would increase and reduced
production would inhibit their ability to export.
Mr Madigan ignored their requests and a few days ago announced that to
qualify for loan rate subsidies in 1993 US farmers will have to set-aside 10
per cent of their maize acreage. As well as cutting supplies, of course, the
move will also harden prices, which may not be entirely divorced from the
coming presidential election and, if the opinion polls are accurate, the
somewhat desperate requirement of President George Bush for all the farm
votes he can get.
Traditionally most farmers do vote Republican. But along with the rest of
the electorate the sector has recently become disillusioned with the
president' s apparent inability to control the economy. They are even more
fed up, however, with the mass of petty, expensive, environmental
regulations sent down from Washington recently and there have been rumblings
of discontent in rural areas.
Mr Bush's response has been to launch a beefed-up Export Enhancement Program
for US grain, which will effectively dump almost 30m tonnes on to world
markets. Quite how this fits in with US ambitions to get a quick settlement
on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also for electoral reasons,
is not entirely clear. The cost to the US treasury, incidentally, will be
around Dollars 1bn.
In addition the president has overturned the recommendations of his
Environmental Protection Agency by backing farmers' calls for ethanol, an
extender or replacement for petrol manufacture from either grain or sugar,
to be encouraged as a 'green' alternative to fossil fuel. The agency had
said that ethanol, while being lead free and therefore desirable from that
viewpoint, could cause air pollution because of other chemicals in its
make-up if used in large conurbations.
By personally approving this alternative market for farm crops the president
has shown that he takes US farmers seriously even though they account for
only about 2 per cent of the electorate.
But would many farmers have voted for Bill Clinton or Ross Perot anyway? A
poll of farmers conducted by Farm Futures magazine before most of the above
measures were announced indicated that 53 per cent favoured Mr Bush, 32 per
cent would vote for Mr Clinton and 15 per cent were undecided. At the time
it was not clear whether or not Mr Perot was intending to run.
And while there is little enthusiasm on farms, even after the recent
financial sweeteners, for four more years under Mr Bush, there is a real
fear that a Clinton-Gore administration would make life more difficult for
farmers.
For although Mr Clinton has said very little about agriculture during his
campaign, and even less in his policy proposals, it is expected, should he
win, that Al Gore, his running mate, will be put in charge of the
environment. That, farmers believe, will lead to even more regulations and
interference in their affairs, which they detest. For Al Gore is seen as a
loony leftist on the environment. His views were expressed in a book first
published a couple of years ago, entitled Earth in the Balance. It has been
described by Mr Fred Smith of the US Competitive Enterprise Institute as 'a
kind of Mein Kampf of the environment movement'.
In his book Gore said, for instance that 'the time has long since come to
take more political risks - and endure much more political criticism - by
proposing tougher, more effective solutions (to perceived environmental
problems) and fighting hard for their enactment'. He wrote of 'our
ecological system crumbling as it suffers a powerful collision with the hard
surfaces of a civilisation speeding towards it out of control'.
The book contained much more in like vein and as the Clinton-Gore bandwagon
has rolled onward and upward it has entered the best seller lists across the
US. Many copies have undoubtedly been bought by farmers who now fear that
they may be easy targets for extremist environmental protection measures by
a new Democratic presidency. But one farmer summed up the more general
feelings of many when he told me: 'I'm fed up with Bush; I don't trust
Clinton and Perot is a joke. To tell the truth I'd rather abstain. But I
guess on the day I'll hold my nose and vote for Bush'.
If the opinion polls are even close to being right that will not make much
difference. 'Slick Willy' Clinton will become president. But only one poll
counts and that's the one on November 3. And as an American television
presenter said the other evening: 'It ain't over till the fat lady votes'.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Leading Article: A bluff too far
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE dire warnings currently emanating from Paris are any guide, the
future of the world trading system now hangs on the whims of a million
Frenchmen. That is only a mild exaggeration of the absurd backdrop to this
week's farm trade negotiations between the European Community and the US in
Brussels.
Although the talks stalled last night, grounds exist for a deal on
agriculture which would unlock the Uruguay round of multilateral trade
negotiations. If the talks eventually fail, it will be due to a failure of
nerve by the EC or to the French government's fear of its farmers. For the
sake of a world economy in which the prospect of a Gatt deal is a rare
glimmer of light, they must succeed.
Both the European Commission (anxious to demonstrate that the EC is not
completely paralysed by its Maastricht problems) and President George Bush
(desperate for a boost to his sagging political fortunes) perceive a narrow
opportunity for a deal before the US presidential election on November 3. An
agreement now on agriculture would in theory clear the decks for rapid
progress on other outstanding Gatt issues early next year. Without one, the
Uruguay round will - de facto if not de jure - be dead, and a rash of
tit-for-tat trade wars will probably ensue.
Hence the shrill noises from France in recent days. President Francois
Mitterrand knows that his European partners want these talks to succeed, if
only because a weakened Mr Bush will be more accommodating than a President
Clinton.
He is also in no doubt that a Gatt deal which includes a mandatory reduction
in subsidised farm exports will enrage his farming community and make his
Socialist government all the more certain of defeat in elections next March.
His answer is to threaten to block whatever compromise is hammered out in
Brussels.
Mr Mitterrand may be bluffing. Under the EC treaties, Community commercial
policy is decided by a qualified majority vote. France can temporise in the
hope that Germany will shy away from an intra-EC confrontation, but without
German support, the only way France can stop this deal is by exercising a
rarely used and legally questionable veto on grounds of vital national
interest. It is hard to see how a group whose output accounts for such a
tiny proportion of French GDP can plausibly be placed in that category.
For the EC to retain any credibility as a body capable of concerted action
on trade, the Commission and its other 11 member states must call Mr
Mitterrand's bluff - if necessary by presenting him with a fait accompli. If
in so doing they trigger a French veto, at least it will be clear where the
responsibility for failure lies.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Lamont tries to clarify
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'TRUST US,' is what, in effect, the chancellor told the Treasury and Civil
Select Committee yesterday. Trust us to bear down on inflation. Trust us to
read the signs given by the monetary indicators. Trust us to exercise
judgment wisely. But no British government can be trusted with the exercise
of such complete discretion.
The chancellor of the exchequer has ruled out return to the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) until several conditions are met, the most important being
that 'the requirements of German monetary policy and those of the UK must
come closer into line'. Official German interest rates may soon fall
further. British monetary policy has already eased. The chancellor could
soon decide that the 'requirements of German monetary policy and those of
the UK' are closer in line.
Would he be right to do so? Probably not, with equal emphasis on the
'probably' and the 'not'. ERM membership has not provided the best possible
monetary regime for the UK. But it might well be better than the policy that
the government will actually pursue. Nothing in Mr Lamont's discussion
stilled worries on this score.
Mr Lamont stressed that monetary policy has to be judgmental. He is right.
But the more judgmental the policy, the more necessary it is for the
policymaking institutions to be both focused in their goals and open in
their procedures. A chancellor of the exchequer working through the Treasury
cannot meet these requirements.
The addition of a target for inflation of 1-4 per cent hardly helps. It is
worth remembering, after all, that the former chancellor, Mr Nigel Lawson,
whose policies ultimately led to inflation of more than 10 per cent,
announced in 1986 that he intended to eliminate inflation in the next
parliament.
The gap between long-term interest rates on conventional and index-linked
bonds - now some 5 1/2 percentage points - makes it clear that investors do
not trust Mr Lamont's 4 per cent target, let alone the 2 per cent he has set
as his longer-term aim. They must be right not to do so.
So many targets - that for a balanced budget or, more recently, for zero
inflation - have come and then gone. The government felt unable to raise
interest rates in the summer to defend the ERM parity, even though the UK's
inflation performance was still mediocre by European standards. Then,
following the abrupt exit from the ERM, the chancellor cut interest rates as
soon as he decently - or indecently - could. Above all, investors know that
Mr Lamont is subject to fierce pressures to declare victory over inflation
too soon.
The only thing the government could plausibly do to increase its credibility
is what it is apparently determined not to do: to tie its own hands. The
government's determination to avoid making the formation of monetary policy
more independent lowers its credibility, makes the cost of achieving low
inflation higher and so, in turn, renders the target still less credible.
Whatever the rhetoric about a new, more open approach to policymaking, the
UK is back to secretive choices, under day-to-day political pressures, among
multifarious indicators, in the pursuit of imprecise goals. Existing
institutional arrangements will not deliver the credible policymaking that
the UK needs. It is time to shift to the kind of arrangements that might.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Bush cues the St Louis blues: Clinton has survived the first
presidential debate and remains on course for the White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ross Perot may well have won the battle of St Louis on Sunday night but it
will take a hatful of miracles for him to win the war for the White House.
Bill Clinton does not need divine intervention to become the next president
of the United States, but George Bush probably now does.
This is the safe conclusion from the first of the televised presidential
debates, a process which has in the past proved influential in the selection
of the president. In part they are watched for the knock-out blow or the
killer mistake, but they also constitute an opportunity for candidates to
parade themselves and their policies. Within the constraints of having to
answer every question in no more than two minutes, they served that purpose
on Sunday night.
Absent the grand faux pas, what came across the nation's TV screens was a
sitting Republican president who really does not think there is much
chronically wrong with the country, an earnest Democratic challenger who
believes government can help put right what is economically amiss and an
independent stuffed with pithy aphorisms about impending catastrophe but
whose solutions, beyond the summoning of innumerable task forces and town
meetings, are a little threadbare.
Mr Perot's performance has the potential once again to disturb the waters of
what had increasingly seemed a still electoral pond, with Mr Clinton sailing
serenely to victory and Mr Bush slowly sinking. On Sunday, it sometimes
seemed the little billionaire was intent on encouraging this progression,
for most of his best one-liners were at the president's expense. Responding
to Mr Bush's assertion of experience as a prime qualification for the White
House, he tartly observed: 'I don't have the experience of running up a four
trillion dollar debt.'
Again, intervening in the only truly acrimonious exchange of the evening
between Mr Bush and Mr Clinton, over the latter's role in organising
protests against the Vietnam war in London 23 years ago, Mr Perot commented:
'When you're a senior official in the federal government spending billions
of dollars of taxpayers' money and you're a mature individual and you make a
mistake, then that was on our ticket. If you make it as a young man, time
passes.'
But with lines like 'we practise 19th century capitalism, the rest of the
world practises 21st century capitalism', Mr Perot also succeeded in making
both his opponents seem precisely what they are - professional politicians
shaped by the status quo. To the extent that the public is fed up with
politics as usual, as it clearly demonstrated by its early summer flirtation
with Mr Perot, the blunt Texan again offered himself as a rallying point to
the disaffected. The probability is that his stock is again on the rise.
As confirmed by the overnight polls, the critical difference between now and
June, when he briefly led some national public opinion polls, is that most
people have stopped believing that he can actually win. Moreover, the core
of his support - among the military, its veterans and the elderly, the
majority white - constitutes a bloc that mostly votes Republican or does not
vote at all. This last month of the campaign may dispel the notion that he
is a 'quitter', but it remains hard to see that it will amount to much more
than that, beyond the confines of particular states like his native Texas.
Still, it was Mr Bush who insisted that Mr Perot be a part of the debates,
in the hope that he would shake up the political impasse. It was a gamble
and it might be backfiring. It is possible that Mr Perot and Mr Clinton may
end up splitting the movement for 'change', but it is probably more likely
that having to defend his economic management from attacks from two quarters
will only put the president further on the defensive.
This is exactly where he cannot afford to be now. Just about the only
offensive manoeuvre Mr Bush managed to spring on Sunday night was his sudden
announcement that, if re-elected, he would ask James Baker to fix domestic
affairs as he had succeeded in fixing foreign affairs. Later, White House
officials started hinting that the current economic management troika -
Nicholas Brady at the Treasury, Richard Darman at the budget office and
Michael Boskin, the economic adviser - was definitely on its way out.
None of this is new. Neither Mr Brady nor Mr Boskin expects to be in office
in January even if Mr Bush wins, while Mr Darman's pitch has been thoroughly
queered by a recent series of Washington Post articles, for which he was a
prime source, detailing the bitter administration infighting over taxation
policy. Even the 'economic tsar' notion was kicked around prior to the
Republican convention in August, but was reportedly rejected by Mr Baker as
too gimmicky.
Even now, it is not clear how firm the proposal is. After the debates, one
Republican spokesman said the president was only thinking of putting Mr
Baker in charge of domestic matters during the transition period between the
election and inauguration in January, after which he would return to his old
haunts in the State Department. Mr Bush himself said 10 days ago that that
is what he wanted his old friend to do.
Critics also had an instant field day with the resurrection of Mr Baker. One
TV commentator openly wondered if it meant that he, not Mr Bush, would
appear in the second or third debate, since it was apparent that he was the
real president. Mr Baker may tell all later this week when, after weeks of
invisibility in the White House, he is emerging to give a formal speech. He
was even interviewed on television after the debate.
More important was Mr Bush's inability to crack Mr Clinton's defences.
Thoroughly prepared for the predictable, the Democrat scored one of the more
palpable hits of the night by recalling the record of Senator Prescott Bush
of Connecticut. 'Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy; you were
wrong to attack my patriotism. I was opposed to the war, but I love my
country. And we need a president who will bring this country together, not
divide it.'
Mr Bush never really got another opportunity to impugn his opponent's
character or otherwise to rattle him. He was left with his stock campaign
lines of optimism ('this country is not coming apart at the seams' and 'we
are still the envy of the world'), foreign policy achievement (most
effective in defending his policies towards China) and the conviction that
less government, not more, is what the country needs. But it was all the
familiar stuff that simply has not been working so far and, as the debate
unfolded, Mr Bush, initially quite relaxed, became more petulant and
repetitive. For the record, it should be noted that no questions about Iran
or Iraq were asked.
As the favourite for the White House, Mr Clinton had, in a sense, most to
lose on Sunday night, though his campaign consistently argues that by merely
holding his own with the president he enhances his credibility. Certainly,
by committing no serious mistake, factual or otherwise, he avoided the worst
imaginable pitfall. He also treated Mr Perot rather gently, joining in his
attacks on Mr Bush but saying nothing that might be construed as critical of
the independent candidate beyond the suggestion that he was putting too much
emphasis on attacking the deficit and not enough on stimulating economic
growth.
In truth, Mr Clinton often looked tense, until he warmed up in the final
half hour, over-programmed and sometimes falsely folksy. But his purpose,
successfully prosecuted, was to hammer away about the economy and the
structural problems of the country, such as healthcare and education, to the
exclusion of most else. When pressed on his credentials for the White House,
he commented that 'experience counts, but it's not everything' and that his
experience 'was rooted in the real lives of real people', not in the
out-dated precepts of the cold war and trickle-down economics.
His message was of 'change', not revolution. He declined an invitation to
criticise the Federal Reserve, saying its monetary policies 'seem to me
pretty sound'. He doubted the US needed to maintain 150,000 troops in
Europe, but said 'we certainly must maintain an engagement there' of, say,
100,000 or slightly less. He thought 'economic security is a whole lot of
national security'. US ground troops should not be sent to Bosnia or
Somalia, but 'it is important to recognise that there are things which can
be done', including a greater effort on refugees and consideration to ending
the arms embargo on Bosnia.
His best moments - and Mr Bush's worst - were on social policy issues like
health, race and drugs. He cited facts and figures on the unsustainable
costs of healthcare, whereas the president devoted most of his answer to an
attack on malpractice lawyers. He asserted his campaign had reached out
across all racial divides, while Mr Bush merely complained that Arkansas had
no civil rights act.
Mr Clinton said his brother's addiction to cocaine had given him a unique
perspective and convinced him that legalisation was not the answer, while Mr
Bush gave the impression that the war on drugs was making real progress.
This left him wide open to one of Mr Perot's better ripostes. 'There are
guys, who couldn't get a job third shift in a Dairy Queen (a fast food
chain), driving BMWs and Mercedes selling drugs and these old boys are not
going to quit easy.'
There are two more presidential debates to go, on Thursday and next Monday,
broken up tonight when Vice-President Dan Quayle, Senator Al Gore and
retired admiral James Stockdale, the running mates, have at each other. If
Sunday was reasonably civil, the suspicion must be that the next
confrontations will be much less so, for the very obvious reason that Mr
Bush still has not found the key to rescuing his presidency.
Since the start of September, his campaign has oscillated wildly between
attempts at constructive criticism of Mr Clinton and, as this made no
inroads, increasingly negative onslaughts on his character. Mr David Gergen,
senior editor at US News and World Report and formerly in the Republican
White House, commented recently that Mr Bush and Mr Baker seemed to have
concluded that 'if the mud doesn't stick, start throwing the sewage'. The
fact that this is not sticking either does not seem to be a deterrent to
hauling up another bucketful.

<TEXT>
It is Mr John Major, not Mr Norman Lamont, who should have been grilled by
the Treasury select committee yesterday. For the economic strategy that
collapsed on September 16 was the prime minister's before it was the
chancellor's. Both were wedded to maintaining the exchange rate with the
D-Mark, but it was Mr Major's repeated public oaths of eternal fidelity to a
magic number that made a voluntary sterling devaluation politically
unthinkable. The chancellor could not make pre-emptive use of the
flexibility designed into the exchange rate mechanism even if he had had the
prescience to do so. The prime minister's pride was the one excuse Mr Lamont
could not allow himself in his televised self-defence.
As the fits-and-starts search for a believable new strategy proceeds we are
back to a further chapter in the same old story. It is once again Mr Major's
weak political position that lies at the heart of the problem. Nobody who
attended the Conservative party conference last week can have any doubt that
the average Tory would rather see a return to higher rates of inflation than
endure a further period of recession. The small businessmen who march behind
the Conservative banner want interest rates sharply down at once, even if
that means the abandonment of monetary policies aimed at holding the
underlying rate of inflation to between 1 and 4 per cent. The prime minister
and the chancellor are doubtless sincere when they say that keeping
inflation low remains their top priority, but their supporters are clearly
unwilling to take more pain.
The markets are aware of this. That is why the events of Black Wednesday
took place. What remains to be seen is whether Mr Lamont's current strategy,
which is to read the newspapers in the morning and then decide what each new
day may bring, will carry conviction. Yesterday he would not admit to any
reason why it should not. As he reminded the committee, he has not so far
strayed from the path of monetary rectitude. True, but 'leave it to me' is
no longer good enough. This is a circular argument. If the individual upon
whose judgment everything hangs has the markets' confidence, his judgment
will be effective. If not, not. But luck does come into it. The markets can
be moved by a variety of exogenous forces. If there are positive upwards
movements in sterling and on the stock exchanges, for whatever reason, that
will be counted in the chancellor's favour. If sellers predominate, Mr
Lamont's tenure of office will be brought to an early end. Fate will roll
his dice.
A strong prime minister, confident of his own position and secure in the
unity of his party, would not find it difficult to devise a better system
for measuring both the performance of his chancellor and the progress of the
economy. He could give responsibility for controlling inflation to an
independent Bank of England. He could introduce genuine accountability, by
setting out precise measures of performance and obliging the Treasury to
report to parliament at regular intervals. Neither option has even been
discussed. When I put the question to members of the cabinet in Brighton
last week they all replied that the subject had not come up.
The remaining option is to bring in a new chancellor, one whose credibility
has not been destroyed by events. In more settled times, the prime minister
would simply move Mr Lamont to another department - the Home Office, perhaps
 -as part of a general reshuffle. For a while at least the government would
look fresh. Mr Major is, however, trying to maintain a fragile union of,
shall we say, rightwing nationalists and British Christian Democrats. He
needs to watch the balance between these two parties in his administration
as closely as he would similar partners in any continental coalition.
The short list of potential replacements for Mr Lamont is composed of names
that would upset the Westminster coalition. Mr Michael Howard, who, as is
proper for an environment secretary, is busying himself with the promotion
of 'Helping the Earth' week, is known to regard even the distant prospect of
re-entry to the ERM with hostility. Mr Michael Portillo, the young chief
secretary to the Treasury, is of a like persuasion; anyhow, his proper
promotion, which could be sky-high, lies in a more distant future. Three
other potential chancellors - Messrs Kenneth Clarke, Michael Heseltine and
John MacGregor - are all solidly pro-ERM. None of the above say they want
the job; all are straightening their ties. Meanwhile Mr Lamont has managed
to acquire a reputation for being both in favour of the ERM and against it,
which gives him a short-term political advantage at the cost of the last
shreds of his reputation.
If Mr Major was not so petrified at the prospect of further upsets within
his party he would cut through all this. The longer he waits, the more he
risks the humiliation of having the decision taken for him by events.

WILL THE taxman spoil the celebrations when the single European market comes

The problem arises because the abolition of customs checks at borders has
brought about changes to the VAT rules and to procedures for collecting
trade statistics. Companies will take over responsibility for administering
VAT and gathering trade data.
Not only are the details of the changes highly complex, they are also being
rushed through in a very tight timescale. The implications may not have been
fully thought through and businesses have very little time to adjust.
The new rules are an uncomfortable compromise between the present
'destination' system, which taxes goods at the import stage, and a fully
fledged 'origin' arrangement, which taxes goods when they leave the factory
gate, to be introduced in 1997.
The transitional system was needed because EC governments could not agree on
a closer harmonisation of VAT rates (the UK, for example, might have had to
drop zero-rating for children's clothes and many food items). There were
also doubts about the ability of some governments to operate the clearing
house for VAT payments which would have been needed.
There is little that can be done at this late stage to modify the proposed
transitional system, though business organisations must start now to plan
for 1997.
Companies should give a higher priority at board level to preparing for the
new regime, and concentrate the efforts of their computer experts on the
complex modifications required.
The customs authorities have indicated that they will be understanding of
genuine lapses by companies but in the UK, at least, Customs &amp; Excise has
gained a reputation for hard dealing. Customs needs to be properly
understanding of the real problems businesses will have to face.
Business organisations, for their part, must do more to make their voices
heard in Brussels. If they had taken early, effective action when the VAT
rules were under discussion they might not need to be so vociferous now.
Finally, ministers must take greater account of the needs of business when
approving legislation. The European idea has fallen out of favour with many
ordinary voters. The last thing the Community now needs is to alienate
businesses as well.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Business Law: Why lawyers should consider consultancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD SUSSKIND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the increasingly competitive legal marketplace, lawyers are seeking to
extend the range of topics on which they feel qualified and competent to
advise.
One natural development will be the provision of consulting services in
fields of expertise in which competence has already been established within
their own firm.
If a firm has invested heavily for internal purposes in areas such as
information technology, marketing, human resources, training, recruitment
and administration, it can recover that expenditure not only through the
cost savings and enhanced performance that would normally be expected, but
also by selling on that expertise.
The potential clients for these services are legal departments of companies,
other professional service providers, public sector lawyers, legal advisers
in Europe and elsewhere, and even other local law firms.
This last eventuality is perhaps the most iconoclastic, in that it may seem
wrongheaded to be helping one's competitors. However, the business benefits
of advising potential competitors may outweigh the advantages of withholding
such advice (given also that the advice will inevitably be obtained from
other sources).
There is a second and more subtle way in which lawyers might move into
consulting - through the provision of legal services proactively, using
techniques and adopting a perspective that would normally be regarded as the
province of management consultants.
Traditional lawyering is reactive, in the sense that clients come to their
solicitors with their perceived legal problems and the lawyer then reacts to
them. There are two well-known difficulties with this approach: first, by
the time the client perceives a problem it may well be too late; and second,
it is unlikely that clients will be able to perceive all their legal
problems.
Increasingly, in recent years, corporate clients in particular have been
asking for a more proactive approach.
In dispute-oriented work, the theme of proactivity is that of dispute
pre-emption rather than dispute resolution; while, in transaction-based
activities, lawyers will be retained not just to crystallise in legal
terminology a deal already agreed on by the parties, but as advisers on all
legal risk management.
Many lawyers will claim that they are already proactive. Most are not. Nor
can they be until they change their working practices radically. Genuine
proactivity goes beyond the ad hoc foresights of a bright lawyer. It
requires the deployment of techniques (often based on information
technology) similar to the more structured and formalised processes and
procedure developed for other tasks by the first-rate consulting practices.
Not until these techniques are established and are being injected by lawyers
into the hearts of organisations and at key points in the life cycles of all
relevant projects can lawyering sensibly claim to be proactive.
Comprehensive (often automated) audits and health checks will be compiled to
assist in surveying the general effectiveness and efficiency of clients'
legal affairs, looking at matters such as exposure to liability,
preparedness for litigation, soundness of document management practice,
quality of standard form contracts, and the mechanisms in place for the
identification of legal problems.
Additionally, these audits will assess whether clients comply with relevant
regulations (for instance, EC directives).
Legal risk management methodologies will also become the order of the day,
akin to those already used by consultants in risk assessment generally.
These methodologies will stipulate, in advance, when and what legal
precautions and measures should be adopted by clients to help them identify,
manage and control potential legal risks; and the teachings of these
methodologies will be integrated with wider corporate practice.
Clearly, a shift towards proactive legal consulting of this sort will
require lawyers to reorientate themselves, using a more familiar analogy,
from practitioners who cure diseases to those who administer a more
preventative medicine. This demands that lawyers release themselves from the
confines of considering the particular consequences of highly specific facts
to functioning (as legal academics have always done) at a higher level of
generality by considering the implications of a wide panoply of potential
scenarios, risks and opportunities.
Whatever the future of consulting by lawyers, comparisons between the
accounting and legal professions are inevitable, not just because the former
has borne substantial management consulting practices but also in light of
accountants' admirable record of recognising and exploiting commercial
opportunities often only loosely related to their core business.
There are lessons here for lawyers. One is that the marriages of accounting
and consulting practices have not always been entirely happy (in forms firms
not least because consulting has not been profitable).
Although both accounting and consultancy services tend to be provided under
the same corporate label, there are clear cultural differences between the
groups that provide the two sets of services and cross-selling and
collaboration opportunities are exploited far less frequently than might be
expected. More vigilant human resource management by lawyers at the outset
may ease such tensions.
Another lesson for lawyers relates to the accounting giants' ability to
recognise commercial opportunities and to marshal formidable resource in
quick exploitation, a capacity of which lawyers have been simultaneously
distrustful and envious.
Taxation, trusts and insolvency work are the best documented illustrations
or markets being taken from the legal profession on the strength of this
entrepreneurial flair.
But the field of data protection offers a more powerful example: when in
1984 a piece of legislation was enacted governing the pervasive practice of
processing personal information electronically, the majority of the legal
profession awaited instructions from clients in the time-honoured reactive
manner while the market was largely captured by the accounting and
consultancy firms who met the real business needs of clients.
In a daunting barrage of professional proactivity in a field beyond their
mainstream business, these accountancy firms provided consulting services in
precisely the way that lawyers can and should today in many other areas of
business.

Wickes, which operates a chain of highly successful DIY stores, was almost
sunk last year following a disastrous diversification into the timber
business but has since steadily clawed its way back from the brink.
McGrath can therefore expect an easier ride than his predecessor had; he
will have more time to spend developing the company's core business in the

McGrath joined Wickes in 1987 following the acquisition of the Builders Mate

FT  13 OCT 92 / People: Alexander squares the circle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Alexander - who revolutionised tea drinking habits through
introducing the round tea bag - has been appointed managing director of
Lyons, the company's manufacturing sector, at the youthful age of 36.
Alexander modestly denies having invented the round tea bag. He says he was
'the guy lucky enough to have approved' the invention of the round, as
opposed to square, tea bag, one of Allied-Lyons' most successful ventures of
recent years. 'Ian Prutton, the deputy marketing director and Bob Hodges,
his managing director, at Lyons Tetley take the honour of inventing it,'
says Alexander.
The round tea bag was launched by Tetley in the south of the UK in mid-1989
and has been 'a tremendous success', he says.
According to Alexander, 'the tea market is a very conservative market place,
where normally one was used to looking at market share movements of decimal
points. Tetley round tea bags put on a full five points of market share, and
the Tetley and the Quick Brew tea brands are now in effect only available in
round form'.
Alexander, a Cambridge University law graduate, joined Allied-Lyons in late
1982, starting out by running the export side of Lyons' tea business. He
went on to run Lyons' ice-cream business and went on to the board of Lyons
in March 1988.
He is appointed to the new position from November 2 and will take over
responsibility for the food sector when David Beatty, Lyons' deputy
chairman, retires at the end of February.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Exporters pick up the
pieces as barricades fall - Next year's European Single Market may bring
with it a bureaucratic nightmare for companies that charge VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radical changes in the way that businesses in Europe account for value added
tax (VAT) are causing consternation among companies and industry
associations throughout the European Community.
From January 1 the formal creation of the Single European market will lead
to the abolition of border controls and remove the customs posts which at
present monitor VAT and collect trade statistics.
Companies with customers and suppliers elsewhere in the Community will
record their own VAT information and compile their own trading records.
There are widespread fears that this, the most fundamental shake-up of the
VAT system for two decades, will create a bureaucratic nightmare and impose
considerable extra costs.
The new VAT and reporting systems will affect the 140,000 UK companies which
currently trade with other EC countries while some 30,000 companies will be
required to fill in far more detailed monthly returns on exports. Many
hundreds of thousands of businesses in other EC countries must also comply.
'We have been horrified at what is happening,' says Sandy Anson, tax
specialist at the Institute of Directors (IOD). 'This was a political
decision taken by the Community before anyone thought of the practical
ramifications. The more you look at it, the worse it gets.'
Other industry groups around Europe share these fears. The French Employers'
Association, the Patronat, doubts whether the new system will really
simplify cross border trade, while its German counterpart, the Bundesverband
der Deutschen Industrie, describes the transitional system as 'an optical
illusion'.
By moving from customs posts to internal controls within companies, the
Community is merely exchanging a visible hindrance to trade for a less
visible, but equally, powerful barrier, says Winfried Eggers, the BDI's tax
specialist.
The tight timetable which has been imposed has meant that many businesses
are scrambling to modify their VAT procedures and their internal data
collection systems. But others remain unaware of the implications of the
changes.
Many companies have made the mistake of treating the new VAT rules as a
purely technical issue and have delegated responsibility to junior managers
in their tax departments. 'There is not the grasp at board level of the
importance of the new system,' comments John Arnold, a tax partner at
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'We are looking at major changes in the way
companies operate.'
The need to have the new system in place by January 1 has put pressure on
both the European Commission and national governments. Amendments to the new
system are still being considered in Brussels while many member states have
yet to pass the legislation needed.
Under the present system, no VAT is payable on exports but tax is levied
when the goods reach their port of destination. When border controls go,
this system will no longer be possible so the European Commission proposed
moving to what it calls an 'origin' system of taxation.
This would have meant an exporter based in London and selling to a customer
in Milan would charge UK VAT just as if he were selling to Liverpool. The
Italian businessman would then recover the UK VAT through his Italian VAT
return and charge Italian VAT when he sold the goods to his Italian
customers.
The problem with this proposal was that it would have required far greater
harmony between VAT rates in the different countries. It would have probably
meant that the UK would have had to drop its zero-rating of childrens'
clothing and many foods, a step with serious political implications.
A clearing house would have been needed to redistribute VAT revenues around
the member states and many countries doubted whether this could have been
made to work effectively.
These difficulties persuaded to the Commission to go for a transitional
system from next January with the aim of launching a full-blooded 'origin'
system in January 1997. Under the transitional system, there is still no VAT
on exports to another EC country and the importer, if it is a VAT-registered
business, pays VAT when it takes delivery of the goods.
But if the purchaser is a private individual, or an organisation not
registered for VAT, the goods are taxed in the exporting country. And
special rules have been drawn up for 'distance sales', such as through mail
order and for sales of high value, easily moveable items like cars, boats
and planes to non-VAT registered individuals.
Finally, since VAT inspectors will no longer be collecting data at border
posts, companies will be required to submit details of imports and exports
to Customs. Smaller traders must file what is known as a European Sales List
every quarter while larger companies, buying or selling more than Pounds
135,000 a year, must make a more detailed declaration every month.
UK Customs &amp; Excise acknowledges that the new tax regime is complex but says
it represents a necessary compromise between the demands of the 12 EC member
states. It has been publicising the new system for more than a year and has
already visited 20,000 companies.
'We hope people will get it right but, realistically, they will not at the
outset so we will treat errors and misunderstandings leniently in the early
stages,' Customs says.
Despite these worries, even the new regime's critics accept that it will
bring some benefits. There should be an end to border delays and a saving on
freight clearance costs at ports. According to one estimate, the abolition
of tax controls at the frontier will lead to Europe-wide savings of Pounds
10bn.
Importers will no longer have to provide bank guarantees to Customs for VAT
payments due. Since the banks set these guarantees against their customers'
total loan facility, this could free a total of up to Pounds 3bn worth of
capital for other uses, the IOD's Anson calculates.
But there are considerable doubts about many of the details of the new
regime. They include:
Difficulties in accounting for what is known as 'triangular trade', when a
buying office in, say, Germany orders goods from Spain for delivery to a
branch location in France. To avoid the risk of being taxed twice, the buyer
must choose where to register for VAT purchases. Triangular trade is far
more common than at first thought.
It may be difficult for an exporter to provide proof his goods have gone
abroad. The government has said exporters will not be penalised if they take
all reasonable precautions but business organisations wonder how
understanding Customs will be. Exporters must record their customers'
VAT-registration number on invoices but some countries, such as Germany and
France, are only now issuing numbers.
Mail order companies doing substantial foreign business must appoint a
representative to handle their affairs locally and provide a contact point
for the local VAT authorities. It may prove difficult and expensive to find
such agents since they will assume an unlimited liability for paying VAT,
says Adrian Ogley, tax specialist at the CBI. 'The cost of maintaining a
local representative may wipe out any profit for a small company.'
Differing currency valuations, transfers to overseas branches which have to
be registered as sales, and alternative ways of doing business such as
leasing, may all create distortions in the reporting of trade information to
the VAT authorities. Many UK companies will have to modify their internal
data collection methods to provide the much more detailed information
required.
The potential for fraud. At present if Customs suspect a misdeclaration of
the value of a shipment, they can hold on to the goods. In future they may
have to check back on the value of consignments made three or more months
earlier.
Confusion could result in the first few months of 1993 because many
countries have yet to introduce the legislation needed to implement the new
system. Countries such as Germany, Italy and Denmark will be introducing
detailed legislation to implement the new VAT system this month or next. The
EC itself is currently working on a 'cleansing directive' to sort out some
of the problems created by the original VAT directive but this may not be
agreed until November or December.
Industry lobbyists around the Community agree that there is little they can
do now to change the way the transitional system will work from January 1
though they are determined to make their voices heard before the final
system is introduced in 1997.
Ultimately, apologists for the new system claim, acceptance is just one of
the start-up costs of the single European market which is forecast to bring
general trading benefits of Pounds 170bn to businesses in the Community.
'But the benefits come in the general commercial area while there are a lot
of costs on the VAT side,' says the CBI's Ogley. 'Everyone wants the single
market but the question is, do they want it at this price?'

FT  13 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Building up a core of
expertise - Case study of The large company
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For British Steel , the problem of responding to the new VAT regulations
hinged on the scattered nature of its operations.
The group had been formed from 14 separate companies, all operating
independently and frequently with incompatible data collection systems.
Group VAT returns are at present compiled from 31 separate 'manual' returns.
With more than a quarter of British Steel's Pounds 4.6bn annual sales made
to other Community members and significant volumes of raw materials and
other goods coming in from continental Europe, the company clearly faced
considerable changes.
British Steel had a choice, explains Harvey Collyer, a manager closely
involved in the project.
It could get each of its operating units to provide the VAT data to Customs
&amp; Excise or, alternatively, it could centralise data collection.
The latter approach had its attractions but the company had never before had
a central commercial data base.
Despite this, British Steel opted for a centralised approach because this
would allow it to build up a core of expertise in single market issues while
the head office experience of VAT matters could be applied to any problems
which arose.
It would avoid individual businesses putting different interpretations on
the reporting requirements.
In addition, the company would have to maintain only one system to process
data for single market requirements and if changes were made in the
reporting requirements, there would only be the need to make one set of
amendments to the system.
Once the decision had been taken to introduce a central system, British
Steel discovered other benefits, says Collyer.
Not only would the information be more accurate, it would also be more
timely because by avoiding the need to cross-check the data, it could set a
later cut-off date.
Delivery information required from national producers under early EC
legislation could be provided centrally and a corporate commercial data base
could be set up.
Responding to the new VAT regulations has produced some valuable and
unexpected benefits but it has also thrown up some tricky administrative
problems.
The two main ones have been obtaining the VAT numbers from its European
customers and deciding on a uniform method of allocating a tariff number,
which identifies a product for customs' purposes, to its purchases.
At present British Steel has no need to record the tariff number, or even to
note the country from which the goods have been supplied.
From January 1 it will have to record this information.
BS believes it will achieve its twin aims of providing the trade data
required by the European Community and automating its VAT returns by January
1.
This is despite the fact that the new VAT legislation is still not complete.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Race to get the systems
right - Computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most companies are now faced with a race against time to make the necessary
modifications to their core computer systems to meet the requirements of the
new regulations.
The alternative will be a time consuming and expensive monthly struggle to
collate information manually.
Many, however, have still to tackle the strategic issues concerned with
changing business practices to meet the 1993 requirements, let alone
modifying their computer systems to produce the information.
Some estimates indicate that only 10 per cent of the 30,000 companies which
will have to submit the most detailed reports have yet begun to assess the
detailed systems changes which will be required.
It seems a classic example of a business imperative falling into the gulch
between general management and information systems management. Each believes
the other is responsible for initiating and implementing the necessary
changes, and as a result nothing has been done.
The heaviest burden will fall on the larger companies - exporting or
importing more than Pounds 135,000 worth of goods a year - and those trading
with several European countries. For companies which have not yet begun to
modify their systems, it may be already too late to meet the end-of-year
deadline.
The reason is that although the software changes might seem slight, they are
extensive, affecting the programs responsible for sales order processing,
purchase order processing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, fixed
assets and inventory. Changes to these core systems cannot be made quickly
or easily.
Many companies rely on accounting software developed years ago in
technologies now obsolete. The design details of these 'legacy' systems
often become obscured and programmers are reluctant to make changes because
of the risk of crashing the entire system or generating errors in other
programs.
Modification becomes more complicated when a company is using a number of
systems. Only a minority have so-called 'integrated' accounting software
which uses common descriptions of data and accounting conventions. Another
reason why time is short is the chronic shortage of skilled staff which
already inhibits companies' ability to develop new computer applications.
There are software packages on the market designed to cope with the new
requirements, but companies cannot simply buy their way out of difficulty by
installing a package. Software of this kind needs data to process and the
only place this can come from is the corporate accounting system.
Companies which have yet to prepare for 1993 have three options, other than
modifying their existing systems.
They can write, or have written, a special piece of software which will
accept data from their existing accounting system and turn it into reports
acceptable to the Customs authorities. This could cost between Pounds 6,000
and Pounds 80,000.
They can buy a cheap and cheerful software package which will generate the
appropriate VAT returns. The data will have to be keyed in by hand, however,
which will be costly in time and money.
They will have to prepare reports manually or pay an agent to do the job for
them.
VAT reports can be submitted on paper, on half-inch magnetic tape, 3.5 inch
diskettes, or via electronic data interchange - a range of options which
some firms may find restrictive.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Switching staff to a new
range of duties - Case study of The small firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Morrisflex, a small manufacturer of rotary tools and finishing machinery,
has been gearing itself up for the VAT changes since April.
The company, which exports one-third of its Pounds 3m turnover, mostly to
other European Community countries, is fortunate in having a full-time
computer manager, says company secretary Jeremy Theaker.
Many companies of similar size - Morrisflex employs 75 people - would not
have a computer specialist and so would have to employ outside consultants.
Morrisflex's computer manager is currently working on creating a database
for the information the company will now have to collect, though it expects
it will also have to do additional manual data collection.
Morrisflex recently wrote to its 100-plus European Community customers to
ask them for their VAT numbers which will have to be included on all
invoices from January.
Just over half have replied so far but there was a particularly poor
response from Germany (which is issuing new VAT codes) and Italy. There was
a good response from the Netherlands, says Theaker.
Morrisflex, based in Braunston, Northamptonshire, does not see much
advantage from the switch to the new VAT system. It does not, for example,
expect to benefit from the removal of border checks because it sends most of
its consignments by parcel post. This means it does not normally experience
customs delays or have to bear the cost of clearing agents.

great tax paperchase - An accountant explains the details / A look at how
the changes will affect European and non-EC companies alike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ARNOLD

<TEXT>
The 1993 VAT changes will affect only the movement of goods between EC
countries. The present rules and systems will remain for all imports and
exports of goods from non-EC countries; services, except for those such as
transport, freight handling and similar services, will not be affected.
Businesses exporting to or importing from both EC and non-EC countries will
have to cope with at least two separate systems. A non-EC business, which
owns goods located in the EC and sells across EC borders, will also be
affected, even if it only acts as an invoicing company.
Until now, EC tax authorities have controlled the payment of VAT due by
monitoring each shipment of imports. But with the removal of border
controls, this will no longer be possible; instead, the controls, including
the requirement for payment of import VAT, are being transferred to the
premises of the importer and exporter.
A UK company importing goods from other EC countries will have to apply the
reverse charge to the value of all its imports. This procedure (which
already applies to many services) involves the company charging itself
output tax and, at the same time, taking relief for the same amount of input
tax - in other words, grossing up both sides of its VAT account.
For a business which can recover all VAT paid, there will be no cost with
this procedure. But partly-exempt businesses, such as banks and other
financial institutions, which cannot recover all their input VAT, will
suffer the same VAT cost as if they had acquired the goods from a UK
supplier.
A UK supplier exporting to another EC country will need to obtain the
customer's VAT registration number (if the customer is registered for VAT)
and quote it on the sales invoice. If it can be demonstrated that the goods
have left the UK, the supplier will be entitled to zero-rate the
transaction.
This procedure applies not only to 'sales' in the conventional sense, but
also to many other cross-border movements of goods, such as transfers
between branches within the same legal entity.
If the customer is not registered for VAT, is a private individual, and the
UK supplier arranges delivery or transport, then the supplier will charge UK
VAT on exports up to an annual limit per country of Ecu 35,000 (about Pounds
24,500) or Ecu 100,000. Over that limit, the supplier will have to register
for VAT in the customer's EC country and charge 'local' VAT. EC countries
are able to choose which limit to apply, and it appears currently that most
will go for the higher.
If the non VAT-registered customer is a legal entity, for example a
governmental organisation, then it will have to register locally if the
level of its imported goods from other EC countries exceeds the local annual
limit, which must be at least Ecu10,000. Once the customer has registered,
the procedure will be the same as for any other VAT-registered customer;
below that level the UK supplier will have to charge UK VAT.
There are also special export rules which principally apply to new cars,
boats and small planes, and require the purchaser to account for VAT in the
EC country of use.
As a further control, exporters will have to submit to Customs &amp; Excise
aggregated listings of all such zero-rated sales per customer and per
country on a quarterly basis. Customs will exchange these listings with the
tax authorities in other EC countries.
But that is not an end to the paperwork. Importers and exporters with annual
intra-EC trade in excess of Pounds 135,000 a year will also have to provide
detailed trade statistics on a monthly basis. Each item exported in the
month must be aggregated according to the Customs Tariff commodity code and
then a further 10 separate pieces of information supplied per code. The
return is due within 10 working days from the end of the month.
This will be a particularly onerous requirement for businesses, many of
which have hitherto relied on freight agents to compile and submit the
documents. Freight agents can of course continue to be used, but the
information will have to be aggregated, and this could cause problems where
more than one agent is involved.
Many businesses will, for the first time, have to register and charge VAT in
another EC country. In addition to the circumstances already described, this
is most likely to occur where the business holds stock in other EC countries
or is involved in 'triangulation'.
This occurs where the invoicing route does not follow the movement of the
goods, for example where A sells to B who on-sells to C (who are all in
different EC countries) but the goods are transported directly from A to C.
Many multinational companies operate in this way.
The UK and some other EC countries are pressing for simplification measures
in order to avoid a multiplicity of VAT registrations across the EC.
The UK and two other EC countries have provisionally introduced their own
simplification measures, and are pressing for their adoption across the EC,
but this is still under discussion.
Registration is a complex administrative and compliance burden, with
additional costs arising from multi-currency and multi-rate VAT invoicing in
another language. Tax representatives or fellow-subsidiaries may be used as
agents, although local subsidiaries may not be able to cope with their
current resources. Registration can also bring direct tax problems as well
as considerable cash flow costs in countries such as Italy if the business
is to be in a VAT repayment position.
There are, as always, penalties both in the UK and elsewhere for compliance
failures. But the biggest risk for exporters is that if they fail to obtain
and quote their customers' foreign VAT registration number and retain proof
that the goods have left the UK, they will be liable for UK VAT at 17.5 per
cent. Proof of export from the UK will not be easy where the customer
arranges the transport. While Customs have suggested that a deposit for the
UK VAT could be required from the customer, this may be difficult
commercially.

European VAT network.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK 'tough' with Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday summoned Iraq's senior diplomat in London to demand the
release of two Britons detained in Baghdad, following charges that the US
administration had acted much more robustly to free an American citizen held
by Iraq.
The two Britons, Mr Paul Ride and Mr Michael Wainwright, are serving long
jail sentences after being convicted of entering the country illegally. Mr
Chad Hall, the American citizen freed by the Iraqi authorities at the
weekend after being held for only two days, was detained on a similar charge
of illegal entry.
Mr David Gore-Booth, deputy under-secretary at the Foreign Office, was
'extremely tough' in demanding a response from the Iraqis.
The Foreign Office has clearly been stung into action by complaints of the
families of the two imprisoned men and by opposition politicians that
Britain has been doing too little to secure their release.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Cairo earthquake kills at least 370

<TEXT>
THE most powerful earthquake in Egypt's history hit Cairo yesterday, killing
at least 370 people and injuring about 3,400 in the heavily-populated
capital and surrounding areas.
Among the dead and injured were children crushed in stampedes when people
tried to rush from shaking buildings into the streets. Security sources,
which gave the casualty figures, said there were reports of 80 collapsed or
damaged buildings across the city, which has a population of 12m.
The one-minute quake, which measured between 5.5 and 6.0 on the Richter
scale and was felt 425km away in Jerusalem, struck soon after 3pm local
time. Mr Safwat Sherif, Egypt's information minister, said the dead included
children crushed in stampedes at schools. President Hosni Mubarak had cut
short a visit to China to return to Cairo, he said.
Last night Saudi Arabia, which has a large resident community of Egyptian
workers, said it was sending Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) to Egypt in aid for
the victims. The official Saudi News Agency said King Fahd had also ordered
a medical team to be made available.
After the quake Egyptian radio and television urged drivers to stay off the
capital's normally traffic-clogged streets to allow ambulances and fire
engines clear passage.
Relatives besieged a hospital in the northern slum district of Shubra
el-Khaimah, where doctors said they had registered 34 deaths. Riot police
cordoned off the hospital.
The US Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, said the earthquake's centre
had been 30km south-west of Cairo.

FT  13 OCT 92 / China 'must experiment' on economy: Fourteenth Communist
party Congress told to embrace the continuing free market reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA should be bold in exploring new ways and 'dare to experiment' in
changing from the old economic structure to the new, Jiang Zemin, general
secretary of the Communist party, told delegates to its 14th congress
yesterday.
Jiang, addressing the first congress since the fall of the Soviet Union,
said that practice had showed that, where 'market forces have been given
full play, the economy has been vigorous and developed in a sound way.'
He foreshadowed further price and state enterprise reforms and an overhaul
of China's elephantine bureaucratic structure.
He revised China's target growth rate upwards, from 6 per cent to 8-9 per
cent for each year to the end of the decade.
He warned, however, that simultaneous prosperity for everyone was not
possible, saying that China must allow and encourage some areas and
individuals to grow rich first.
Jiang held out little hope for any form of political reform, despite a
pledge to improve the country's legal system. He said the goal of this
reform was to build a 'socialist democracy' and 'absolutely not a western,
multi-party, parliamentary system.'
Diplomats said that much of what Jiang said on politics was defensive and
underlined that, while the party was prepared to adopt western economic
methods, it had set its face against western ideas.
They doubted, however, whether China could absorb the west's economics and
remain untouched by its political ideas.
The decision by the Congress not to reappoint the Central Advisory
Commission, a 190-member body containing the party's elderly members, and
Jiang's encouragement for younger officials were seen as positive
developments.
He wrote off the June 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations for democracy - which
ended in bloodshed after the military was called in - as 'a political
disturbance' over which the party and government took a 'clear-cut stance.'
The collapse of the Soviet Union last year was obliquely referred to as
'drastic changes in the international situation' which the party weathered
calmly.
Much of what Jiang said concerning economic reform had been well leaked
before the Congress or had already begun to be implemented over the past
year. As such, it came as little surprise to diplomats and observers in
Beijing, but the very fact that he said it gave the measures the imprimatur
of the party, they said.
'The people have now got a formal endorsement from the top to go out and
make money,' one western banker observed.
According to one western diplomat: 'Anything is almost possible in China and
this document will give companies the ideological underpinning to get out
and do what they want.'
The top priority for China's leadership is the reform of the state
industrial sector. 'We must change the way in which state-owned enterprises
operate and push them into the market,' Jiang said.
He foreshadowed the separation of ownership from management by making all
large and medium-sized state enterprises legal entities which would be
responsible for their own financial performance. Limited privatisation was
also forecast with small state-owned companies to be leased or sold to
collectives or individuals.
Jiang indicated that the cost of change might be unemployment.
He said the state should speed up the establishment of a social insurance
system 'covering unemployment, old age and health and the reform of housing
in the cities and towns.'
Those responsibilities are at present borne by the state industrial sector.
Reform of the price system was key to the success of economic reform, Jiang
said. He said it was necessary to proceed more rapidly with price reform and
establish a system where most prices are determined by market forces.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Korea's perennial opposition leader boosted by DLP split:
Kim Dae-jung looks set to gain as leading figures quit a ruling party still
dogged by division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE presidential hopes of Mr Kim Dae-jung, South Korea's perennial
opposition leader, have suddenly improved as the ruling Democratic Liberal
Party (DLP) appears to be splitting apart.
The crisis in the DLP reached a critical point over the weekend with the
resignation of Mr Park Tae-joon, head of the party's majority faction.
The departure of Mr Park, who also resigned last week as chairman of the
state-affiliated Posco steel company, is likely to trigger the exodus of
other important DLP figures who could establish a new conservative political
party.
That would damage the chances of Mr Kim Young-sam, the DLP nominee and
current leader in the presidential election, expected in mid-December. State
television said yesterday that Mr Kim would announce that he was resigning
as a member of parliament today to devote himself to the presidential
campaign.
Analysts said that by quitting parliament he was hoping to heal the rifts in
his party.
Conservative support for Mr Kim has already been eroded by the candidacy of
Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the South Korean conglomerate Hyundai who
formed the United People's Party (UPP) earlier this year.
By contrast, Mr Kim Dae-jung's support, which mainly consists of working-
and middle-class voters in Seoul and his home base in the rural
south-western Cholla region, remains firm. He is now running a close second
behind Mr Kim Young-sam.
The DLP has been an uneasy political alliance since its creation in 1990 as
a result of a merger of President Roh Tae-woo's Democratic Justice Party
with two opposition parties, including Mr Kim Young-sam's Reunification
Democratic Party.
Mr Kim agreed to join the government and give it a majority of parliamentary
seats in return for a promise that he would receive the DLP presidential
nomination this year. The constitution bans Mr Roh from standing for
president again.
Mr Kim, who stood as an opposition presidential candidate in the last
election in 1987, duly received the DLP nomination in May.
But his recent actions have alienated Mr Roh and his supporters, including
Mr Park, who constitute the majority faction in the DLP.
Critics have accused Mr Kim of becoming arrogant and pushy, placing his
supporters in the top DLP positions in spite of his minority status within
the party.
Mr Kim also angered Mr Roh last month by pressing him to appoint a new
cabinet as part of an effort to improve his chances before the election.
Mr Kim was concerned that allegations of government vote-rigging in the
parliamentary election last March might tarnish his image and he wanted a
neutral caretaker cabinet to supervise the forthcoming poll.
But Mr Kim's demand backfired. While agreeing to a cabinet reshuffle, Mr Roh
also resigned from the DLP in the name of electoral 'fairness'. Mr Roh's
move was interpreted as a withdrawal of his support for Mr Kim.
This intensified factional squabbling within the DLP, culminating in Mr
Park's departure over the weekend.
Mr Park may join a nascent political party being formed by Mr Lee Jong-chan,
a popular Seoul MP who unsuccessfully stood against Mr Kim in the DLP
presidential convention in May.
Mr Park has discouraged speculation that he would be the presidential
candidate for the new political group. Instead, the nomination may be
offered to Mr Kang Young-hoon, prime minister between 1988 and 1990 and now
head of the South Korean Red Cross.
But there are doubts whether the new party can be organised in time for the
election. This has prompted proposals that Mr Park and the other
dissatisfied DLP members might merge their forces with Mr Chung and the UPP,
which is a well-financed and established organisation with 31 seats in the
299-member National Assembly.
Co-operation between Mr Chung and Mr Park would bring together two of South
Korea's most prominent industrialists and establish a precedent for business
playing an independent role in Korean politics.
Korean companies have traditionally accepted a subservient position to the
government, financially supporting the ruling party in return for political
favours.
Mr Chung broke that tradition by challenging the government with the
formation of the UPP. The political revolt staged by Mr Park confirms that
the nation's businessmen are aggressively seeking a more equal partnership
with government.
Mr Park has reportedly met with Mr Chung at least three times recently to
discuss a political alliance. But the former Posco chairman wants Mr Chung,
who is now a distant third in the opinion polls, to step down in favour of
another candidate. Mr Chung so far appears determined to remain the UPP
candidate.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Kanemaru urged to resign over Tokyo gang links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE disgraced 'godfather' of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, Mr Shin
Kanemaru, was told yesterday to resign from parliament by a senior member of
his own party, Mr Taku Yamasaki, the construction minister.
The resignation call was ignored by Mr Kanemaru, leader of the LDP's largest
faction, who is at the centre of a controversy over his violation of a
political funds law and his links to gangsters.
Mr Yamasaki, a member of a separate LDP faction, said Mr Kanemaru must
resign because the gang links had undermined his reputation. The 'godfather'
is said to have used those links in an attempt to persuade extreme-right
wing groups to stop protesting against LDP leaders in recent years.
The call by Mr Yamasaki was criticised by other government officials, but
reflected the tension within the party over the sustained public criticism
of Mr Kanemaru, who was recently fined Y200,000 (Pounds 935) for illegally
receiving Y500m in donations from a parcel delivery company.
Heads of four business organisations, including the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren) and the Association of Corporate Executives, also
demanded that Mr Kanemaru give up his parliamentary seat. Mr Kanemaru has
been confident that he can ride out the criticism, but the controversy has
forced him to keep a low profile.
Public prosecutors, who announced that their investigation into illegal
donations to politicians was over, have felt a need to respond to the
continuing protests.
They said yesterday that investigations into the Y500m may be re-opened,
raising the possibility that some of the 60 politicians who later received a
share of the money could be questioned.
Meanwhile, Mr Kanemaru's faction has settled a few of its internal
differences by announcing a new structure in which some power is transferred
to groups opposed to Mr Kanemaru's chosen successor, Mr Ichiro Ozawa.
The appointment of two new deputy chairman within the faction is likely to
lessen the influence of Mr Ozawa, one of the more outward-looking of Japan's
leading politicians. In the longer-term, the new power-sharing arrangement
could weaken the ability of the faction and the LDP to decide on new
policies, both domestic and foreign.

<TEXT>
MR PIK BOTHA, South Africa's foreign minister, arrived in Angola yesterday
to join efforts to try to save the war-shattered country's fragile peace
process.
Mr Botha's arrival came amid signs that the international community, led by
the United Nations, is increasingly unable to keep a lid on tension between
the government and Unita, the former South African and US-backed rebel
movement.
Western observers hope that Pretoria, which backed Unita's guerrilla war
with South African troops and weapons between 1975 and 1990, may be able to
exert some influence on Mr Jonas Savimbi, the hard-line, egotistical rebel
chief. They say that the key to Angola's future depends on what Mr Savimbi
really wants - a question no one seems able to answer.
Unita has alleged fraud in the country's first democratic elections last
month and has made veiled threats to return the country to civil war. The
elections were won by the MPLA government and President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos.
Yesterday Mr Elias Salupeto Pena, one of the most senior Unita officials,
warned that if the government published official election results, expected
today, it would amount to a declaration of war. He demanded that the
elections be annulled.
An investigation of Unita's allegations of fraud is nearing completion but
officials say they have found evidence only of incompetence. Many observers
believe Mr Savimbi is using the fraud allegations either as a bargaining
position to get a transitional government of national unity in his favour or
as a pretext to buy time and to prepare a military strategy.
Mr Botha said yesterday he had come to listen to both sides to try to find
common ground between them.
He will meet both President dos Santos and Mr Savimbi today. He arrived 24
hours after heavy shooting erupted in Luanda which left at least four people
dead.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S banks yesterday reported a sharp increase in individual payment
defaults, with 171,613 cases in the first eight months, up 63 per cent on
the same period last year.
The figures are generally interpreted as an indicator of personal
bankruptcies, and the rise this year continues a trend begun in 1989, when
the number of cases rose 29 per cent. In 1990, following the collapse of
stock prices, cases increased 54 per cent.
The Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan said the increase this year
was linked to the continuing weakness of stock prices, which had undermined
the asset base of some families, and a rise in credit card delinquency.
Individual Japanese are generally thought to have weathered successfully the
economic downturn, but the banks say that rates of borrowing compared to net
income have increased sharply, while overtime earnings have fallen.
A continuing surge in individual bankruptcies would suggest that consumers
are more burdened by debt than the Economic Planning Agency has reckoned,
and are less able to lead an economic recovery.

THE United Nations yesterday presented to donor nations a 100-day action
plan for Somalia intended to strengthen UN relief operations in the war and
famine-ravaged country.
This follows strong criticism that the UN aid effort has been feeble and
badly co-ordinated.
Mr Mohamed Sahnoun, UN special representative for Somalia, said at least
300,000 Somalis, mostly children, might have died over the past 18 months
'whilst the UN and (most of) the international community . . . watched
Somalia descend into this hell'.
The UN said almost 1m Somalis were on the brink of death from starvation and
disease, and millions more might die if urgent assistance was not
forthcoming.
It is appealing for Dollars 82.7m (Pounds 46.4m) to implement its plan for a
massive infusion of food aid, alongside provision of shelter materials and
medical supplies, a mass measles immunisation campaign and the start of a
longer-term programme of recovery and rehabilitation, including delivery of

Baroness Chalker, Britain's overseas aid minister, yesterday urged Mr
Sahnoun to make security his highest priority.
'We have a duty to the starving to make clear to those who are using
violence to frustrate the relief effort that the international community
will no longer stand by and see the poor and sick held to ransom,' she said.
The precarious security in Somalia, which has led to widespread looting of
food supplies, preoccupied delegates on the first day of the two-day donors'

FT  13 OCT 92 / Arts: Nureyev's 'Bayadere' just hints at riches - Clement
Crisp attends the opening performance of the Paris ballet season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ballet season began at the Paris Opera on Thursday night with Rudolf
Nureyev's production of Petipa's Indian spectacular, La Bayadere. This has
been a long-cherished project for Nureyev, but in view of his ill-health the
staging can best be considered a sketch of what he might have achieved under
happier circumstances. With sets by Ezio Frigerio and costumes by Franca
Squarciapino, it looks opulent enough to have emptied a Rajah's treasury
down to the last emerald. In interpretation, though, it only hints at
riches: the Opera dancers don't yet know how to wear these jewels of dance
and drama.
When Nureyev first mounted part of Bayadere in the west he put on the
'Shades' scene for the Royal Ballet in 1963 - he was giving us the best of
the work. The rest had been much edited and revised in Leningrad, with a
massive cut in 1919 when post-Revolutionary stringencies lopped off the last
act so that the story lost its denouement. Six subsequent producers laid
hands on the text: what we see today at the Kirov Theatre is far from
Petipa's original. It is nonetheless sustained, given credibility, by weight
of performance tradition and the immense dignity of the Kirov dancers'
style. We believe, because their every action speaks of belief.
For Paris, Nureyev has reproduced the Kirov version, with the assistance of
the distinguished Petersburg ballerina Ninel Kurgapkina. He had intended, I
believe, to provide his own recension of the lost fourth act - as did
Natalya Makarova in her 'complete' staging which we know with the Royal
Ballet and with American Ballet Theatre - but circumstances precluded this.
There are, otherwise, only a few small additions owed to Nureyev; the Minkus
score (replete with those traditional Hindu waltzes) has been lightly
cleaned by John Lanchbery, and is admirably played under Vello Pahn's baton.
When he became director of the Opera Ballet in 1983, Nureyev put on Raymonda
as his first production, and inculcated in his casts a sense of the
harmonies of Petipa style which gave a commendable seriousness to the
ensemble. This quality was too little apparent in the new Bayadere. Save for
Elisabeth Platel's Gamzatti and Laurent Hilaire's Solor, interpretation was
light-weight, self-centred. Visual extravagance seemed to underline a lack
of faith in the text, as if luxury would impress where performance failed,
and gorgeous trappings disguise a dramatic void. Frigerio has provided grand
and somewhat claustrophobic settings for the Rajah's palace, and an
oppressive facade for the temple in the crucial first scene. (PierLuigi
Samaritani's painted back-cloths for Makarova's staging are to be preferred.
They show the locales specified in Petipa's original libretto, and echo the
production strategies of the Kirov version - whose ravishing scenery dates
from 1900). The jungle vista in which Frigerio places the Shades is,
however, most poetic; and Solor has a splendid property elephant - as in
Petersburg - for his entrance in Act 2.
Franca Squarciapino has plundered the east for fabrics, and for decorative
ideas - the priests wear what look like small golden Burmese temples on
their heads. Silk and sequins, gold thread and pungent Indian dyes, gleam
and blaze; fantasy rather than historical probability is the key. Thus
accoutred, the Opera dancers turn drama into a dress parade. Wearing tinsel
and glitter, they propose tinsel and glitter in playing. A Russian Nikiya,
emerging from the temple for the first time, carries her fate and the whole
action of the ballet with her, as we known from Makarova and Asylmuratova.
It is this vital sense of purpose that must now be given to the Opera casts
as they start to explore La Bayadere. On Thursday the soloists in the Grand
Pas and in the Shades scene offered vivacity instead of harmony; the Chief
Brahmin was petulance incarnate; the Rajah had the nobility of a used-car
salesman involved in a dodgy deal. Of course, in physical expertise and
elegance of manner the Opera dancers are magnificent; their redoubtable
skills, though, seem hardly to impinge upon La Bayadere.
The Nikiya was Isabelle Guerin. Her reading was conscientious, but the heart
of the role was untouched. (I wish she could see the spiritual fervour that
fires Asylmuratova's playing.) Even her superbly easy account of the Shades
scene was oddly unmoving, poetry lost amid flawless pirouettes. Happily,
Elisabeth Platel has the physical and emotional assurance that bring
Gamzatti to life. Whether glaring balefully at the end of the first act as
she meditates vengeance on Nikiya - curtain-fall frozen by her basilisk gaze
 -or showing a radiant assurance in the Grand Pas, she is mistress of the
role. Laurent Hilaire is a fine Solor, bold in presence as in dance, and
with a refinement of manner that compels our belief in this warrior hero.
Since his earliest appearances in the West, the power of ballet's traditions
has ever concerned Nureyev. In La Bayadere, as in his other classic
stagings, he asserts the continuing potency of the old repertory and of the
academic style. In this last gift to the Opera, he reaffirms his concern:
his dancers have yet to comprehend the grandeur of the example he has given
them.
La Bayadere continues in performance at the Palais Garnier, Paris, until the
end of October.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Arts: Barbican triumphs for Rattle and Uchida
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Barbican on Saturday, Simon Rattle and his City of Birmingham
Symphony enjoyed another of their resounding triumphs. The piece de
resistance was Szymanowski's Violin Concerto no. 1, with Thomas Zehetmair as
a superb soloist, but the other performances on offer were anything but mere
fill-ups. In particular Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, nowadays a familiar
war-horse, galloped into newly vital life. Rattle had ensured maximum
horsepower for it: twelve cellos, for example] - which paid sonorous
dividends in the crucial low-string recitatives. His own imaginative
wrestling with Bartok's score secured prizes beyond the merely aural.
I should reckon Rattle's account of Mozart Symphony no. 39 as carrying
roughly 2 1/2 times the communicative power of Previn's performance with the
LSO a week earlier. That was 'respectful'; by contrast Rattle and the CBSO
were lithe and constantly alert, every movement stamped with muscular
character.
As for the Szymanowski concerto, Zehetmair and Rattle gave it the rapturous
shove it deserves toward the permanent repertoire. Some years back, William
Mann described it as the most sheerly beautiful music ever written. In a
performance like this, it seems just about that: not only because
Szymanowski's opulent orchestra is so exquisitely balanced against the
soloist's exacerbated lyricism, but because the score is so cogently knit
around its hyper-poignant harmonic nodes.
Zehetmair was cagey about those. With the recurring 'motto' theme - a
descending five-note phrase which takes a heart-stabbing upward wrench
toward its sixth note - he played mock-innocent: no freighting of the final
note, which he left the orchestra to colour. Otherwise he sang out with
thrilling confidence, eloquent in the high ledger-lines and commanding in
throaty, rough-bowed passages at the lower extreme, appealingly frail in
pianissimo confessions.
Under Rattle the orchestra matched him, though in a bright-eyed, hard-edged
focus that lost the ultimate degree of heady suggestiveness. We ought to be
seduced, not rampantly overwhelmed. Yet Rattle remains our leading advocate
of Szymanowski's cause - for he gives the music full value as music, and not
just as a musical equivalent of nitrous oxide.
                           *      *      *
The Barbican Hall remains an unfriendly place in which to hear pianists,
diffuse and hard to focus, but Mitsuko Uchida's recital there on Sunday
afternoon was an unqualified delight. There are few contemporary pianists
whose encounters with untried works are so eagerly awaited as hers; every
item she adds to her programmes becomes a voyage of discovery which carries
its own invitation.
On this occasion the unknown territory was the expanses of Schubert's G
major Sonata; Uchida's performance, complete with exposition repeat, was the
focus of the second half of her recital. It was unfolded as a sequence of
beautifully fashioned panels. The first movement, taken at a very broad
moderato (though with nothing like the slowness of Richter's famous
performance), emerged with perfect naturalness, the Andante stirred into
fierce life for its central section, the minuet enclosed a trio of
musical-box delicacy; each reprise of the final rondo offered a different
perspective, a change of lighting and emphasis.
Immediately before the Schubert Uchida had played Webern's Variations Op.
27, gradually building the tension until she could diffuse it all magically
in the coda, and after it offered as an encore another perfectly chiselled
miniature, the second of Schoenberg's Op. 19 set. The first half of the
recital had been devoted to Beethoven and Schumann - the E minor Sonata Op
90, launched with tremendous elan and carried along in a series of bold
imaginative sweeps, and +Carnaval+ conceived, it appeared, as a single
seamless span that scarcely paused for reflection. On this kind of form
Uchida is the most irresistible Schumann player imaginable, every musical
image burnished bright and laced through with the most intense threads of
lyricism.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Arts: Latin-American fiesta - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Columbus's arrival in the New World 500 years ago may not have been a cause
of unequivocal celebration in the world outside, but in the world of music
it provided the excuse for the presentation of New World-related
compositions in big, enjoyable splashes. On Sunday - Columbus Day itself -
Radio 3 devoted 14 hours of its schedule to a continuous stretch of live
concerts from around the world; the chamber group Lontano, on air from
London from two to three in the afternoon, made their contribution (of music
by Villa-Lobos, Revueltas, Chavez and Roldan) the climax of a four-concert
series entitled 'A Fiesta of Latin-American Music'.
The theme of this series, devised by the Lontano conductor Odaline de la
Martinez, was the exploration of the musical relationship between the
European and American cultures - a theme loose enough to allow an easy
mixture of styles, with brightness of colour and sharp rhythmic definition
as common factors. On Tuesday at the ICA, in a programme featuring the
American Betsy Schramm, the Argentinian Michael Rosas Cobian and the first
two parts of Colin Matthews's impressive chamber epic The Great Journey,
Lontano made a particular success of Going with the Grain (1991), for solo
marimba and small ensemble, by the young English composer Martin Butler.
In common with Butler's O Rio, a highlight of the 1991 Albert Hall Proms
series, this piece delights the ear through the sway of gentle syncopated
rhythms - identifiably if not pin-down-ably Latin - and the parallel
teasing-out of seductive colour-patterns. It is a kind of concerto for
marimba (brilliantly played by Richard Benjafield) without the element of
battle between soloist and accompaniment usually associated with the
concerto form; and its exoticism is fully absorbed into the fabric of the
invention, not facilely tacked on.
On Saturday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Lontano were joined by the London
Chamber Symphony for the third (1938) of Villa-Lobos's Bachianas Brasileiras
 -the one with an elaborate solo piano part (played here by Gilberto de
Matte) - in which jungle bird-song and neo-Baroque musical forms achieve a
raucously appealing marriage.
The British premiere of Algebra on Fire (1991) by the Brazilian Alejandro
Vinao attempted an analogous confrontation of modern technology (including a
role for computer) and instrumental ensemble - of, as it were, European
rational discourse and Latin irrational imagination. The experience, full of
dramatic potential and dark, fiery textures, was hampered by the recourse to
amplification, which rendered everything monochromatically loud.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Arts: Imaginative implication of the monumental - William
Packer discusses the sculptors Eduardo Chillida and Igor Mitoraj
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Catalan sculptor, Eduardo Chillida, is now at 68 firmly established as
one of the great artists of the post-war period, widely and regularly
exhibited on the continent and in the US over four decades. Yet in Britain
one would hardly know it, until the autumn of 1990, when the South Bank
Board made magnificent amends in giving him a full-dress retrospective at
the Hayward. Yet even then an exhibition as physically beautiful and
impressive in its installation was shamefully neglected critically and
under-visited. Any Chillida show is therefore still a major and remarkable
event, and this at Annely Juda, only the fourth in London in his long
career, all the more to be welcomed.
This present show of recent work is entirely in the character of the whole
oeuvre. It includes nothing on a truly monumental scale, yet the
free-standing pieces are weighty enough, and even the tiniest of the
maquettes, or the most delicate of the paper reliefs, carry all the
imaginative implication of the monumental. And it is all extremely
beautiful.
He is a carver and a modeller, never the assembler or collagist, even though
much of his material may only be cut or bent by the heaviest industrial
equipment. The sense is always of the object made directly under the
artist's own hand. The imagery is nominally abstract and unspecific,
referring to nothing outside itself, yet the carvings offer spaces to enter
and inhabit in the imagination, the metal arms and fingers writhe and twist,
inviting a real embrace. Human in scale, directly active and physical in
their engagement, humane in all their connotations and suggestions, these
things tell us that nothing that touches our experience can be truly
abstract.
Does this reach to the nub of the problem? To be accepted as the thoroughly
modern artist in official eyes, must one stand back from the material and
the making of the work and any intuitive development in favour of a coldly
cerebral, theoretical engagement? But Chillida has ever been his own man, a
thoroughly modern artist yet sublimely indifferent to the supposed
imperatives, the ever-changing orthodoxies of avant-garde and critical
fashion. Such is his strength, which is why he is so good and, in the longer
term, will surely be seen to be so significant an artist of our time.
Igor Mitoraj, the younger artist by 20 years, was born in Germany during the
war and brought up in Poland. He now divides his time between Paris and his
studio at Pietrasanta, near the marble quarries of Carrara. He too is a
carver and a modeller, and his work, currently on show at the Yorkshire
Sculpture Park and three London galleries, is nothing if not figurative. He
derives his imagery from classical example and is particularly intrigued by
the isolated and portentous, often massive fragment - the foot of some
vanished colossus or perhaps the mask, the 'shattered visage' of old
Ozymandias , with its 'frown, and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command'.
A head is draped and bound into anonymity: a group of heads, broken and
split, gaze calmly out upon the world; a headless torso in its breastplate
rises monumental on its high plinth; androgynous angels stand quietly
together; a high-stepping centaur, a head peering from its belly, strides
out across the hillside.
This is neo-classicism revived not as principle but as romantic day-dream
that frequently comes perilously close to kitsch indulgence and
sentimentality. Mitoraj is no Canova, and the marble carvings especially
have much of the quality of Victorian funerary statuary, more worthily
competent that convincing. And yet there remains a certain imaginative
potency that, in the more successful pieces, is very strong.
There is much in all four shows for an English sensibility to resist, the
slickness the overall air of cultural chic. But the prejudice should be
resisted, for it is unfair. As a modeller, in the terracottas and the cast
bronzes, Mitoraj shows himself to the greater advantage, especially so in
the more intimate pieces. The touch is sure and lively, the observation
acute, the realisation, for all the symbolic adaptation, distortion and
fragmentation, close to the physical reality presence of the human model. It
would seem that in this newest work, despite all the success of public
commissions on the largest scale, Mitoraj is still growing rapidly as an
artist and moving in unexpected directions. These several shows make us look
forward to whatever comes next.
Eduardo Chillida: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until November
14; Igor Mitoraj: Yorkshire Sculpture Park, West Bretton, West Yorkshire,
until spring 1993; supported by The Henry Moore Foundation, Visiting Arts &amp;
the European Arts Festival; also at the Academia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate
SW7, until November, supported by the Arts Council of Great Britain; the
Berkeley Square Gallery, 23a Bruton Street W1, until October 14: the
Economist Plaza, St James's SW1, until December.

A promising night. BBC2's often excellent foreign affairs series, Assignment
(7.45) considers the reduction to second class citizens of those Russians
who, when the Soviet Union collapsed, found themselves marooned in such
places as Latvia and Estonia which are now once again independent republics.
C4's arts magazine Without Walls, also often excellent, promises Simon
Callow on Shakespeare's sexuality ('challenging the conventional notion of
his heterosexuality', which hardly sounds novel, but still) and an
examination of Brigitte Bardot's influence on style and sexuality in France.
Battlecries (9.50 BBC2) considers the relationships between officers and men
in the trenches of World War 1 and in Japanese PoW camps in World War 2.
Omnibus (10.25 BBC1) provides a profile of film director Ridley Scott, so
strong on atmosphere (from the Hovis ads to 'Blade Runner') but weak on
narrative and character.
ITV's four-part documentary series on The Kennedys (10.40) begins with
Joseph, father of John, Robert and Edward.
There are few good movies about television; Network (11.20 BBC1) is one.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (1): Paths to open
systems clear - As telecommunications and computing converge, the drive
towards seamless networked systems is speeding up and the large vendors are
at last backing the introduction of an industry-wide set of rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLOW but inevitable convergence of computing and telecommunications is
providing the motive force for an implosion of new information processing
practices and technologies.
A lexicon of neologisms has emerged to label these concepts: enterprise-wide
computing, co-operative computing, client-server architectures,
plug-and-play environments, rightsizing.
What they all amount to is new ways of describing a concept more than a
quarter of a century old: distributed data processing or ddp, the idea that
computer power can be spread throughout an organisation if it can be
contained in small enough packets. For many companies it means substituting
a large number of small computers connected in networks for a small number
of larger machines.
International Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest computer
manufacturer and staunchest defender of data processing centred on mainframe
computers, is joining in. Last month among a raft of new communications
products it announced adaptors (special circuit boards) that allow portable
computers unprecedented access to corporate information systems as well as
announcing plans that could see CICS, its flagship transaction processing
software, dominating the open - or vendor independent - systems environment.
The range of issues now encompassed by distributed data processing is
bewilderingly broad. At one end of the spectrum is the dilemma of how to
manage very large data networks, now the biggest concern among information
technology managers. At the other, the question of which operating system
should prevail in the open data processing environment of the late 1990s.
It is also providing the dynamo for the growth of a large number of
entrepreneurial companies which were quick to recognise the possibilities of
computer communications. These include Novell, the leader in software for
personal computer networking and 3Com and Cisco which specialise in
'internetworking', providing the hardware and software which allows local
and wide area networks to talk to one another.
These developments are taking place against a background of the worst
instability the computer industry has known. Prices are tumbling as improved
technology cuts the cost of components. Distribution channels are being
undermined as gross profit margins narrow. The global recession is forcing
customers to put a cap on capital investment.
The large telecommunications companies, meanwhile, are taking a new interest
in computing services, the fastest growing area of the computer industry.
BT has emerged as one of the largest systems integration companies in the
UK. France Telecom is negotiating to take a stake in Sema Group, the large
Anglo-French services company. Mercury Communications, BT's principal
competition in the UK is moving into managed data communications, securing,
among others, a Pounds 15m, five-year contract with TSB Retail Banking and
Insurance.
The purpose behind these activities, whether overt or not, is the creation
of 'intelligent networks' which will give customers greater control of their
telecommunications and cost savings from improved allocation of network
resources.
For the telecommunications companies intelligent networks will provide an
integrated, managed, services environment. Competition is already developing
between the big companies to provide managed voice and data networking
services for international companies.
The growth of computer communication is underpinned by a number of trends,
including the evolution of open systems.
Standards are at the heart of open systems. One of the most abused of
industry terms, open systems simply imply computers that can easily be
connected into communications networks and with the capacity to run software
from any supplier obeying the open systems rules.
Last month Mr Jim Manzi, chief executive of Lotus Development Corporation
told the Etre conference of top computer industry executives that open
systems were the only way customers could expect an uninterrupted return on
their investment in computerisation.
Many corporations share a common dilemma. Their operations, whether national
or international, have grown in response to a business strategy in which
information technology played little part.
The result is all too often an electronic Tower of Babel of incompatible
computers and software which denies senior management the chance to create
enterprise-wide communications and has meant corporations have derived fewer
benefits than expected from considerable investments in computers and
communications.
This dissatisfaction is driving the open systems movement. Large vendors,
while paying lip service to open systems, have been less than enthusiastic
about implementing them because of heavy investment in their own designs.
Digital Equipment and IBM were networking pioneers - IBM through its
mainframe networking protocol Systems Network Architecture and DEC through
its VAX compatible computer line - but tardy in implementing open systems.
Both are now changing rapidly. Earlier this month IBM announced early
support for the latest version of an industry-wide set of rules that
guarantee a product conforms to open systems standards.
The rules are set by X/Open, a worldwide, independent open systems
organisation which is dedicated to developing a multivendor Common
Applications Environment, based on both formal industry standards and
standards which have become accepted de facto.
X/Open's new set of specifications, XPG4, comprises 22 separate components
covering operating systems and languages, data management, user interfaces,
general interworking, mainframe interworking, PC interworking and media.
Products which meet the XPG4 specifications will pass the open systems
interoperability test and can safely be connected together in corporate-wide
networks.
Advances in open systems are still confused by the arguments over operating
systems. There are still those who see open systems as synonymous with Unix,
a multi-tasking, multi-user operating system developed by AT&amp;T and now
championed by Unix International, a non-profit organisation responsible for
directing the evolution of Unix System V, an industry standard.
Competition for Unix will be seen from Microsoft with Windows NT, IBM with
OS/2 and Taligent, an IBM and Apple joint venture, with a operating system
codenamed 'Pink'.
Just as portable telephones have revolutionised conventional communications,
so tiny portable 'digital communicators' capable of handling voice, data and
image, are expected to revolutionise computer communications. Apple, AT&amp;T in
co-operation with Matsushita, Marubeni and EO, have already announced
product intentions. IBM is not expected to be far behind.

Friday's sell-off

Wall Street
US MARKETS yesterday regained some of the ground lost during last week's big
sell-off, but trading was light because of the Columbus Day holiday, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 37.83 at 3,174.41,
almost recouping Friday's 39.45-point loss. The more broadly based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 4.77 at 407.43, while the Amex composite
finished up 1.13 at 365.98 and the Nasdaq composite 3.32 higher at 573.84.
Turnover on the NYSE was 126m shares.
With banks and the bond markets closed for the day, trading was subdued. The
rise in share prices was seen primarily as a reaction to the 120-point drop
in the Dow over the preceding seven trading days.
Although the underlying mood of the market remained gloomy, both about the
economy and third quarter corporate earnings, some investors believed the
recent losses created attractive buying opportunities.
Investors were also cautious about trading ahead of this week's economic
statistics. Retail sales and producer prices for September are due tomorrow,
followed by consumer prices (Thursday) and industrial production (Friday),
both also for September.
There was little reaction from the markets to Sunday's presidential
television debate. Political analysts judged that the none of the three
contenders established a clear advantage during it, and consequently
Governor Bill Clinton's lead in the polls would probably remain
unchallenged.
Among individual stocks, the motor sector was in strong form, buoyed by some
positive comments from Mr Scott Merlis, the industry analyst at Morgan
Stanley, about the outlook for the big three manufacturers in 1993. Ford
climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 36 1/4 , General Motors added Dollars 1 5/8
at Dollars 30 3/4 , and Chrysler rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22 7/8 , all
in heavy trading.
Advanced Micro rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 12 1/2 after analysts at two
broking houses, Merrill Lynch and Gruntal &amp; Co, upgraded their ratings on
the computer company's stock.
IBM climbed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 as some investors bought in
anticipation of a better-than-expected earnings report on Thursday.
Maxus Energy rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 7 1/4 after Wall Street invest
ment bank Kidder, Peabody agreed in an out-of-court settlement to pay the
Texas-based energy group Dollars 165m to settle an insider trading lawsuit
stemming from a 1983 takeover. General Electric, Kidder's parent company,
was unaffected by the news, and was up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 75 3/8 .
Avalon jumped Dollars 1 to Dollars 3 5/8 and Zemex rose Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 5 1/2 after Dundee Bancorp proposed to acquire the former for
Dollars 3.75 a share and the latter, in which Avlon holds almost 50 per
cent, for Dollars 5.50 a share.
Toronto was closed yesterday for Thanksgiving.

<TEXT>
AN intraday recovery in Germany and a strong opening in New York helped the
FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index recover from early lows, writes Our Markets Staff.
Madrid was closed for a holiday.
FRANKFURT broke below its 1992 closing low of 1,420.30, recorded last
Tuesday, the DAX index hitting a day's low of 1,415.94. But the index
recovered to close 7.12 down at 1,432.54.
Mr Matthias Welticke of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that there were three
reasons for the intraday recovery: first, closing of positions ahead of the
expiry of October call and put options next Friday; secondly, the belief of
many Germans, especially short-term operators, that the market will bottom
out; and, finally, the apparent resistance of the DAX to any permanent break
below the 1,420 level.
Nevertheless, falls were the day's main individual talking points. Bayer,
the premium stock among the big three chemicals,
dropped DM5.10 to DM242.40, some dealers blaming a tenuous link with a
hazardous materials case, others the industry association's recently bearish
assessment of general profitability and prospects.
Siemens, which added redundancies in its semi-conductor operations to
earlier problems in its Siemens-Nixdorf computer business, extended its
period of relative weakness with a fall of DM6.30 to DM539.20.
MILAN ended lower, weighed down by selling linked to the exercising of call
options yesterday, and as investors sold out, disappointed that a cut in
interest rates had not been announced at the weekend. The Comit index fell
0.72 to 396.85 in turnover estimated at L150bn after Friday's L238bn.
Dealers expected trading to be technical ahead of the close of the account
tomorrow.
The insurer, Ras, was one of the day's biggest casualties, falling L2,000 or
11.8 per cent to L14,900 after Friday's news that its one-for-four rights
issue would start tomorrow.
Fiat rose L107 to L4,181, supported by reports that Alcatel Alsthom of
France was interested in buying Fiat's 25.4 per cent in Alcatel Italia.
PARIS fell at the opening following Friday's drop on Wall Street and then
rebounded in the afternoon as the US market opened firmer. But there was
little else for Paris brokers to get their teeth into, and turnover was a
mere FFr1.06bn. The CAC-40 index ended 2.29 lower at 1,655.05.
The main moves in the day came in the second-liners. Among leading stocks,
Michelin fell FFr4.10 to FFr174.60, Societe Generale fell FFr7 to FFr520 and
Paribas added FFr10.90 to FFr291.
AMSTERDAM saw dull trading as the CBS Tendency index lost 0.3 to 107.5.
Pirelli Tyre Holding gained Fl 1.20 or 9.4 per cent to Fl 13.90 after
Friday's plunge on news of its plan to double its share capital. KNP was
down 30 cents at Fl 39.50, ahead of news after the close that it expects a
sharp fall in 1992 earnings.
BRUSSELS was weaker in quiet trade although Petrofina bucked the trend with
a gain of 1.2 per cent. The Bel-20 index lost 2.33 to 1,092.54 in turnover
of BFr557m.
Petrofina recovered BFr100 to BFr8,050 after Friday's 5 per cent decline on
news that Norway might close an important North Sea installation in which
the group has a 30 per cent stake.
ZURICH was little changed, the SMI index firming 3.1 to 1,881.5. Among banks
UBS bearers gained SFr1 to SFr788.
STOCKHOLM eased in thin trading, the Affarsvarlden General index falling 2.7
to 665.3 in turnover of SKr213m after SKr354m. B shares in Volvo lost SKr1
to SKr213. Reports that the car company would cut production of 1993 models
by 12,000 units and was considering the closure of two of its Swedish
assembly plants came after the close.
VIENNA's ATX index recovered from an intraday low of 766.55 to end down 5.64
at 770.52. ISTANBUL's 75-share index gained 81.42 to 4,021.92.

FT  13 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Italy gains 10 per cent on moves in
political arena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN equity markets remained volatile last week, amid sporadic hopes
that Germany would ease monetary policy. This helped both Italy and Spain
register substantial gains in the FT-Actuaries World Indices while senior
European bourses recorded falls. The FT- Actuaries World index was 1 per
cent lower on the week.
Italy rose 10 per cent in local currency terms as investors were encouraged
by moves in the political arena and proposals to suspend capital gains tax.
With no one wanting the collapse of yet another coalition government, there
were hopes that the budget package would be passed by parliament in the next
few weeks, in spite of opposition from trade unions. At the weekend four
subsidiary laws to the budget, dealing with local government finance, health
and pensions, were passed, clearing the way for approval of the main
legislation.
Ms Marie Christine Keith, Italian analyst at County NatWest, says
short-covering also boosted the market's performance last week, helping to
push Friday's turnover to a high L238bn. She noted that the devaluation
effect lifted the share prices of companies with strong export markets, such
as Benetton, up 14 per cent on the week, while Generali's 13 per cent gain
also contributed largely to the advance in the Comit index. Another insurer
in demand was Ras, ahead of Friday's news that its planned share capital
increase was to commence this week.
Spain saw a negative start to the week, a 3.6 per cent decline on Monday,
one of the year's steepest one-day falls, followed by strong gains during
the sessions to follow. By mid-week domestic and foreign investors returned
to the market, as the threat of a further devaluation in the peseta waned
and the Spanish government said it had no plans to raise interest rates in
the short term. In contrast to Monday, the 3.2 per cent rise in the general
index on Thursday was one of the best sessions of the year.
However, Mr Stephen Hughes, Spanish analyst at Nikko Europe, remains
cautious about the market. 'Foreign investors are rightly still wary of the
forex controls . . . and a consensus remains that the peseta will have to
devalue further in the short term,' he said. 'For a sustainable rally to be
established, the currency risk for foreign investors must be relieved.'
Nordic countries remained depressed last week with Denmark limping along
under the weight of a shattered financial sector. Last week two more banks
were downgraded by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, and another placed
on the watch list. The market continues to lack direction, analysts say,
while uncertainty over the Maastricht process lurks in the background.

FT  13 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei, Hang Seng rise
against the trend

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices firmed in quiet trading on index-linked buying towards the end
of the session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 242.23 to 17,302.01 after a low of 17,086.66 and a
high of 17,307.02. Investment trust funds and public pension funds moved in
to support share prices late in the afternoon, and foreigners were seen
buying in small lots.
Volume totalled 150m shares, the lowest since August 17, falling sharply
from Friday's 483m. Settlements for October option prices had boosted
activity at the end of last week.
Advances led declines by 520 to 370 with 186 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first-section stocks gained 10.68 to 1,309.33 and, in London trading,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.11 to 1049.5.
While public fund managers have provided a floor for share prices by
indicating buying interest below the 17,000 level, analysts said that this
in turn seemed to be causing the stagnation in the market.
'The price-earnings ratio is currently too high and buyers are waiting for
an adjustment,' said Mr Yuichi Kohashi, strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The dollar firmed against the yen, lifting some high-technology exporters.
NEC rose Y30 to Y715 and Sony advanced Y80 to Y4,030.
Ito-Yokado, the supermarket chain, rose Y110 to Y4,040 on reports that the
company expected a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the current fiscal
year, despite a fall in consumer demand.
Hanshin Department Store fell Y78 to Y527 on profit-taking. The issue had
surged previously on the strength of Hanshin Tigers, the Osaka-based
baseball team. However, failure to win the league series prompted heavy
selling. Other Hanshin group companies were also lower, with Hanshin
Electric Railway down Y34 to Y431.
Environmentally-related issues were actively traded by speculators. Chugoku
Marine Paints, the leading paint maker, finally fell Y3 to Y685 after rising
on hopes of higher orders of its pollution-free ship bottom paints.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 59.25 to 18,953.14 in volume of 6m shares.
Investors dabbled in low-priced theme stocks, but overall activity remained
low. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y60 to Y9,850 on the rise in the
dollar against the yen.
Roundup
SPECIAL circumstances took Hong Kong up against the trend in the region
yesterday.
HONG KONG had an exuberant opening in the wake of the Sino-US trade
agreement which concluded on better terms than had been rumoured on Friday.
The Hang Seng index ended 128.86, or 2.3 per cent higher at 5,725.57, after
hitting 5,790.70 at the opening.
Turnover was a relatively heavy, at HKDollars 3.58bn. Property developers
were the most active stocks on the day, with Sun Hung Kai and Cheung Kong
gaining HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 33.50 and HKDollars 0.60 to HKDollars
21.20 respectively, while HSBC led the banks up with a rise of HKDollars
1.00 to HKDollars 13.40.
NEW ZEALAND fell 1.1 per cent to a new 1992 low in early trading, the
NZSE-40 index dipping to 1,366.88 before a recovery to 1,375.56 at the
close. The five major companies that make up around 70 per cent of the
exchange's capitalisation have run foul of US and European pessimism with
forestry combine Fletcher Challenge, which has lost half its market value in
the past three months.
BANGKOK saw a technical correction, after recent rises and on investors'
concern about volatility in New York. The SET index ended 14.63, or 1.65 per
cent lower at 871.71, its largest daily loss for four months, in turnover of
Bt9.40bn.
AUSTRALIA was subdued by overseas uncertainties, and even the ADollars
1.23bn bid for the biscuit manufacturer, Arnotts, by Campbell Soup of the US
failed to generate enthusiasm. The All Ordinaries index closed 3.3 lower at
1,463.0 and Arnotts, after suspension, was unchanged at ADollars 8.00
against Campbell's ADollars 8.80-a-share offer.
SEOUL wobbled on the departure from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party of
its co-chairman, Park Tae-joon. The composite index shed 10.87 to 514.90,
with turnover of Won152.09bn, against Won137.34bn for the half-day on
Saturday.
MANILA's blue chips weakened as second liners rallied and the composite
index fell 16.25 to 1,391.88. Combined volume surged from 5.79bn shares to
7.81bn, but turnover eased from 342m to 331.6m pesos.
BOMBAY fell sharply after a World Bank report warned India about a possible
balance of payments crisis; the market was also hit by a rise in inflation
to 9.2 per cent for the week ended September 26, from 7.4 per cent two weeks
earlier. The BSE index fell 109.05, or 3.3 per cent to 3.166.52.

CONCERNS about the sharp fall in New York on Friday sent Johannesburg lower
and the overall index fell 54 or 1.8 per cent to 3,024.
Gold shares were weak following the decline in the bullion price and the
index lost 36 or 4.2 per cent to 817, while the industrial index shed 28 to
4,038.
De Beers and Anglos, which together have a combined weighting of about 17
per cent on the overall index, led the declines.
De Beers lost R1.90 to R48.35 and Anglos closed R3.75 or 4.6 per cent down
at R77.50.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Money Markets: UK rates ease again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH rates in the sterling money market softened yesterday morning as
dealers continued to believe that a near-term cut in UK base rates might
become possible, writes James Blitz.
However, towards the end of the day, several dealers felt that the
possibility of a base rate cut had receded following comments from the
chancellor of the exchequer to the House of Commons Treasury Select
Committee, and an analysis of the Bank of England's operations in the
sterling money market.
As one discount house dealer put it: 'Nothing in what the chancellor said
gave me the impression that base rates were about to come down.'
The structure of Mr Norman Lamont's economic policy was not fleshed out in
any more detail, but some dealers felt that there was a clearer commitment
to managing the exchange rate to ensure that inflation is controlled.
In the morning, the Bank of England's offer to deal in the early round
without a repurchase agreement fuelled speculation that a rate cut was
imminent.
Traditionally, the Bank offers to buy a 'repo' at the established rate when
it wants to kill all thought of a base rate move.
The news that it was offering to deal in the shorter-dated Bands 1 and 2
actually heightened speculation of a cut, pushing 3-month money down to 8
3/4 per cent. The December short sterling contract shot up to its highest
level since 9 per cent base rates were introduced, peaking at 91.98.
According to one dealer, the Bank turned down offers to buy bills at cheaper
rates, re-establishing the rates for Bands 1 and 2 at 8 7/8 per cent. 'By
turning cheaper deals away, the Bank sent a strong message to the market
that rates are not going to change,' he said.
The December short sterling contract later fell back to close at 91.89, 1
basis point up from its opening level. Cash rates retained their optimistic
tone, with 3 month money closing  3/16 per cent down on the offered side at
8 3/4 per cent. One month money closed at 8 15/16 per cent from 9 1/8 per
cent offered.
The Bank revised its forecast shortage down from Pounds 750m to Pounds 500m,
buying Pounds 4m of Band 1 bank bills, a further Pounds 254m in the
afternoon, and providing late assistance of Pounds 165m.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: DM tensions may not be over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR closed weaker against the D-Mark at the end of European trading
yesterday, as dealers digested Mr Alan Greenspan's weekend comments
expressing concern at the lack of economic growth in the US, writes James
Blitz.
At the end of last week, analysts asserted that the 6.5 percentage point
differential between US and German interest rates had widened to its fullest
extent, and that the heavy investment in D-Marks might subside. The dollar
was well supported on that view.
Yesterday, despite a quiet day in the markets because of the Columbus Day
vacation in the US, there were signs that an easing in the differential is
not imminent. The chairman of the US Federal Reserve said that no US
monetary policy initiative could be ruled out, and the dollar fell in
Monday's Asian trading to DM1.4610. In Europe, it regained its poise, but
closed 1 1/2 pfennigs down on the previous close at DM1.4720.
An 11 basis point drop in the December Euromark futures contract signalled a
revision away from the thinking that the Bundesbank will cut rates at its
council meeting on Thursday. The market was over-optimistic about the
prospects for a cut at the last Bundesbank council meeting, and people are
still divided over how the German central bank is responding to the
recession.
Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros Bank in London, believes that a
German rate cut will come soon and that there will be 7 per cent interest
rates in Germany by the end of 1993. Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at the
International Bank of Japan in London, is more cautious. 'The market is too
far ahead of the Bundesbank,' he said.
Uncertainties on German policy may be gently undermining the French franc,
which closed down more than a centime yesterday at FFr3.40. compared to its
ERM floor of FFr3.4305 against the D-Mark.
The franc, the benchmark of currency stability in Europe, could still
survive in the ERM without a devaluation. But the franc's defence has left
French commercial banks borrowing money from the authorities at a rate
several points higher than their own lending rates.
'All the good news about German rates is already in the market,' said Mr
Hannah, 'and, if the French ease rates now, it's hard to see where they can
go next.'
Sterling was barely affected by Mr Norman Lamont's appearance before the
Treasury Committee of the House of Commons. Mr John Hall, an economist at
Swiss Banking Corporation in London, spoke for several analysts when he said
that that there was nothing new in the speech barring the restatement of a
highly pragmatic economic policy. The pound closed down against the D-Mark
at DM2.51.

Meeting his manager when going to cut a lettuce in two for a customer, a new
assistant in a US store remarked: 'There's a stupid woman who wants half a
lettuce . . .' Then noticing the customer had followed him, he added: 'but
this nice lady would like the other half.'
Impressed, the manager later offered to promote the assistant to a
supervisor's post in Detroit. 'Oh no]', said the young man. 'All the women
shoppers there are either prostitutes or hockey players.'
'I'll have you know my wife comes from Detroit,' the manager snapped. 'Which
team did she play for?' came the reply.

More evidence, if such were needed, that the two parts of Germany are

Evidently US defence company General Dynamics, which has just ousted
Britain's Vickers from a tank deal in Kuwait, still believes in the
traditional ways of winning friends in the Middle East.
Off to the Gulf are its chairman, William Anders, and fellow board member
Frank Carlucci, the former US defence secretary, together with wives and a
bulging gift-sack which, besides such baubles as crystal and expensive
briefcases, includes three ceramic falcons and another of bronze.
Observer understands that Saudi defence minister Prince Sultan can expect to
receive the bronze example today. In Kuwait, where the delegation is due
tomorrow, the prime minister, Crown Prince Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah,
can likewise count on adding a statue to his collection.
Meanwhile, a special present is being reserved for Abu Dhabi's Sheikh
Mohammed, third son of ruler Sheikh Zayed and a highly influential figure in
defence procurement. He gets a bowie knife.

Fancy whiling away the odd hour blasting off a bazooka on your visit to this

Tiananmen Square towards the airport and, a bit to the west, you'll find the
16 1/2 -acre China North International Shooting Range.
Billed as the first 'entertainment type shooting activity place' in the
country, it is 'provided with over 20 kinds of small arms, such as various
pistols, rifles and machine guns, rockets, designed and built by China to be
fired by friends of all nations'.
Moreover, if you suspect that the other friends' aim may be wayward, don't
worry. You can blast away from inside one of 20 shooting compartments
'fitted with bulletproff (sic) steel plate'.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Observer: Dispenser of privilege
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Card-carrying ex-comrades have just gained a new privilege in Moscow,
although in today's world there are only about 600 of them in Russia's
population of 150m-plus. The cards in question are needed to work a newly
installed cash-dispensing machine which Visa claims is the first in the
former Soviet Union.
Located in Moscow's exclusive Metropol hotel, it disdains the plunging
rouble which the authorities are trying to make convertible. The system will
dispense only dollars to tourists and the 600 inhabitants with Visa cards.
The cards - fastidiously issued to elite holders of hard-currency accounts
through a local commercial bank called Credobank - were instituted by Visa
last year as a contribution to the development of a market economy. But the
blessings are going mainly to foreigners who have found it near impossible

Although Visa says it will proceed step by step until a mass market for
cards evolves in Russia, it looks forward to having cash machines at other
tourist centres in the country by the end of next year.
By then, who knows, a bit more than 0.0004 per cent of the indigenous
population will be deemed rich enough to benefit, too.

</HEADLINE>

   From Dr GERALDINE D KAYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to Peter Somner's letter on insurance protection for
software (October 8), could I suggest that he undertakes a course of study
in actuarial science before commenting on what is or is not feasible using
modern-day actuarial techniques. Actuarial judgment is of value wherever a
combination of both mathematical reasoning and common sense is required.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Letter: Fiscal conflict that is not a matter for despair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M R WEALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's article ('What I would do as chancellor', October 8)
ends with the suggestion that the conflict between GDP exchange rate and
inflation targets may be irreconcilable. There is no need for this note of
despair provided one makes a distinction between those variables which are
intermediate targets, used as guides for short-term policy and medium- to
long-term goals.
The exchange rate is surely in the former category. I doubt people felt
happier when Pounds 1 was DM11.76 (or in 1923 when Pounds 1 was RM1010) than
they do now. On the other hand inflation and output are the latter category.
and most economists would agree with Mr Brittan that they are best combined
into a target for money GDP. The exchange rate has an important influence on
money GDP, and the most obvious thing to do is to use the exchange rate
target as a short-term guide to interest rate policy, while varying the
exchange rate target with reference to current performance of money GDP.
Obviously this is not compatible with a permanently fixed exchange rate, but
it is compatible with membership of an ERM in which realignments are seen as
a matter of course and not as the worst crisis since Dunkirk.
To relegate fiscal policy in the way that Mr Brittan does is surely a
mistake. If money GDP were on course to grow at target rate with the old
exchange rate, the devaluation must have raised the rate of growth of money
GDP and a fiscal contraction is needed to offset this. Of course, if money
GDP were growing too slowly at the old rate, then a change in the exchange
rate must have been a good, not bad idea.
The combination of a money GDP target with some measure of saving (like
public saving or the PSBR) requires joint use of monetary and fiscal policy.
If the two instruments are separated, there is a risk that the monetary
authority will find itself having to offset the effects of fiscal policy on
monetary GDP, while the fiscal authority has to offset the effects of the
monetary policy on the budget balance. For this reason I hope he is too busy
as chancellor to push through his Bank of England Act.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Letter: Unilever's divided view of social chapter queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was interesting to read the endorsement of the Maastricht treaty by
the chairman of Unilever, Mr Michael Perry (Letters, October 9).
There is just one thing that puzzles me, and that is Mr Perry's enthusiastic
support for the exclusion of the UK from the social chapter.
Could he explain why the improved rights to consultation and information for
workers, which the chapter will help bring about, should apparently apply to
employees of Unilever NV but not Unilever plc? What have his British
workers, and our members, done to deserve this second-class status?
I was under the impression that both companies are part of the same
transnational operating in an integrated European Community. Have I got it
wrong?
I think we should be told.

FT  13 OCT 92 / When unity can sap the strength of a union: Germany's IG
Metall wields unusual power, but will have to struggle to maintain its
influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's 3.5m-strong engineering union, IG Metall, is an increasingly rare
organisation in the industrialised world - a trade union with power and
self-confidence.
But Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the leader of the union who this week presides
over its triennial Congress in Hamburg, will need all his own strength to
keep it that way, as German politicians and employers look to organised
labour for the sacrifices needed to finance unification and to resist
recession.
Mr Steinkuhler's union faces these difficulties from a position of relative
strength. It has won for its west German members a 35-hour week and, in 1991
and 1992, secured pay deals which were above the rate of inflation. For its
850,000 new east German members it has done even better - winning a deal
with the engineering employers to implement a phased equalisation of wages
between the two parts of Germany by 1994.
Much of the union's historic success has been rooted in laws which give
employees a significant voice at both plant and board level in German
industry. IG Metall, the largest of Germany's 17 industrial unions, has also
played an important role in the institutional web of government, employers,
unions and the Bundesbank, which steers the German economy.
But as the economic costs of unification have become more apparent, the
German corporatist model - and in particular the privileged position of
organised labour - has come under increasing attack.
Critics, led by the liberal Free Democrats, the smaller party in the
coalition government, say that while the model may have helped to distribute
wealth in a steadily expanding economy it should now be jettisoned. They
claim that the external shock of reunification, exacerbated by the threat of
recession, has revealed the lack of flexibility in the corporatist system.
Mr Steinkuhler sees his job as maintaining the union's place at the centre
of economic management during what he describes as a defensive period for
organised labour.
He accepts that a dialogue over financing reconstruction in the east is
urgently required, and is even ready to accept a five-year pay agreement,
providing wages are raised in line with inflation and taxes.
But in contrast to the government, which wants cuts in pay and welfare in
the west to form the centrepiece of a 'solidarity pact' to finance a
transfer of funds to the east, the union wants more tax increases. This
time, says Mr Steinkuhler, the taxes must last longer and 'all social forces
must pay according to their ability to do so'.
By that he means that the self-employed and public officials - who were
excluded from part of last year's unification tax increase - should bear a
greater share of the burden. He also favours a levy on post-tax profits,
which would be higher for companies not investing in eastern Germany. In
support of his demands he says that, since 1990, employees have contributed
DM73bn (Pounds 29.2bn) to the cost of unity compared with only DM17bn from
employers.
Mr Steinkuhler is equally clear in rejecting arguments for a suspension of
the wage equalisation deal for eastern Germany. Employers say the agreement
merely protects the well-off western workers from competition by raising
unit labour costs in the east.
Mr Steinkuhler believes that the problem in the east is not wage levels but
a lack of marketable products. He says that where workers have taken pay
cuts - such as at the MZ Zschopau motorbike plant - factories have still
closed.
There is also said to be opposition to the wage equalisation agreement from
within his own union. Some of the eastern members of IG Metall are believed
to oppose the deal because they attach more importance to job security than
to wage increases. Mr Steinkuhler, however, claims that the equalisation
deal is popular in the east. 'Our people there tell us that they cannot pay
capitalist prices with socialist wages,' he says.
The equalisation deal is also a measure of how attitudes towards the
financing of reunification have changed. In 1990 the deal enjoyed almost
universal assent. It was expected to promote the swift social union that the
east Germans had been promised as well as helping to slow the exodus of east
Germans to the west.
Mr Steinkuhler argues that the emigration from east to west continues and
that without the agreement it would accelerate again. Many economists,
however, claim that the flow is driven by unemployment more than low wages
and that the equalisation deal is contributing to the loss of jobs.
The IG Metall leader appears to concede there is some connection between
higher wages and unemployment in eastern Germany. For example, he quotes
approvingly the expectation that real labour costs in eastern Germany will
remain 20 per cent below those in western Germany even after wages are
nominally equalised in 1994. That is because east Germans will not receive
many of the extra benefits enjoyed by their counterparts in the west. A
senior colleague also says that the union might offer a freeze at the 1994
wage level in the east for several years.
Even if he wins the arguments on such issues, however, Mr Steinkuhler is
facing more practical problems. Most worrying is the fragmentation of the
bargaining system in the east. German employers say that a large number of
companies in the east have not joined their respective employers'
associations and even those that have are often paying below the agreed
level - with the approval of their employees.
In western Germany a 21-month deal agreed in May has resolved wage disputes
for the duration of the pact, but IBM Germany, a subsidiary of the US
computer company, has recently announced its withdrawal from Gesamtmetall,
the engineering employers' body. Other big employers, such as Daimler-Benz,
are transferring jobs abroad. In another worrying precedent for IG Metall,
the DAG white-collar union recently offered a pay cut at Lufthansa.
This must all seem a long way from the union's last West German Congress in
1989. Then it was rallying for its successful assault on the 35-hour week
and developing a new bargaining programme for eliminating distinctions
between blue and white-collar workers.
As in Germany, times have also become harder in international markets. In
response, IG Metall has tried to support the international competitiveness
of its members by strengthening sister unions around the world and by
pushing the Social Charter within Europe. For the moment, according to Mr
Steinkuhler, the big challenge is to prevent a flood of cheap labour from
eastern Europe.
Ahead, he observes, lies a period of 'tougher distributional conflict'
throughout the industrial world. But few other unions are as well equipped
to tackle the struggle.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Letter: Retailers are victims of arbitration process, not
lease terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your graph ('Nightmare on the high street for UK retailers', October 6)
shows retail rents increasing by 80 per cent more than retail sales in
1986-90, whereas throughout 1971-86 rents and sales stayed close.
This overshoot of rent over sales involved a shift of resources from tenant
to landlord reasonably explicable by market forces. The sales surge meant a
shortage of retail premises, tenants paid high rent increases at review,
equating increased demand for shops with limited supply. Had the boom
continued high rents would have resulted in more shops. In recession retail
sales collapsed, many shops fell empty, yet rents continued to rise in
arbitrations.
(Had market forces been allowed to work, rents would have fallen more than
sales, allowing retail prices to fall to equate supply and demand, empty
shops to reopen and recovery to start. Resources would have started to shift
back from landlord to tenant.)
Instead retailers suffered closure and ruin and the Retail Price Index was
falsely inflated, not by market forces, but by the failure of the present
arbitration set-up. Upwards-only clauses of shop leases have rarely operated
in the slump, since arbitrators still award increases. Thus the arbitration
set-up, not lease terms, is the main problem.
Retailers, who in 1986-90 accepted an 80 per cent rent overshoot over sales,
realise that a corresponding undershoot under sales cannot happen in
arbitrations, and they will be forced to keep paying the inflated 1986-90
rents for at least 14 years (see Professor Burton's 'Retail Rents: Fair and
Free Market'). For retail landlords a rent review means heads I win in
booms, tails you lose in slumps.
Reasons for unfair rent reviews include: landlords and their agents
deliberately suppress or rig rental evidence in arbitrations; reviews are
settled by two or three local dealers in the second-hand house market;
modern valuation methods are not employed.
Retailers with a residential house enjoyed both an overshoot in house price
during the boom and suffered a price collapse during the slump. If their
house was collateral the bank often closed their over-rented shop. For
retailers in boom or slump it's heads landlord wins with high retail rents,
tails I lose on house prices. Now retailers understand what is happening we
will refuse to allow the arbitration scandal to continue.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Retailers leading Europe in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's biggest retailers continue to be the most profitable of their kind
in Europe in spite of the recession.
According to an analysis by Management Horizons consultants, the six most
profitable retailers in Europe last year were UK companies. Their
profitability, the report says, stemmed from big investments in own-brand
development; superstore construction; information technology and
distribution systems.
J. Sainsbury topped the profit list, notching up Pounds 628m last year. It
was followed by Marks and Spencer; Tesco; Great Universal Stores; Boots; and
Argyll Group, owner of the Safeway chain. UK companies accounted for 24 of
the 50 most profitable European retailers.
Management Horizons cautioned that direct profit comparisons across Europe
were fraught with difficulties because of differences in national accounting
policies.
Some of Europe's biggest retailers - such as the privately owned Tengelmann
and Aldi groups of Germany - were also excluded because they do not publish
their level of profitability.
Nevertheless, Management Horizons said the study highlighted the efficiency
of UK operators and the differences in retail markets across Europe. UK
retailers had benefited from operating in a market in which shopping
environment and product range counted for more than just low prices, it
said.
The concentration of retailing power was higher in the UK than in many other
markets, affording the leading companies greater economies of scale, it
added.
'The 1990s will be characterised by an increasing amount of cross-border
activity, with the advent of 1993 and the opening up of eastern Europe set
to accelerate the process of pan-European co-operation, expansion and
integration.'

FT  13 OCT 92 / Rover revives MG sports car marque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the British Aerospace volume car subsidiary, today formally launches
its MG RV8, a redesigned and more powerful variant of the MGB sports car
last produced in 1980, claiming that it already has 'hundreds' of orders.
The RV8 was initially in-tended to be sold in the UK only. But Rover said
yesterday that, because of the level of inquiries both from continental
Europe and Japan, where Rover's Mini has already be-come a 'cult' car, that
it was considering re-engineering the car for export.
Company executives say the Pounds 26,500 RV8 has been developed to mark the
30th anniversary of the MGB, more than 500,000 of which were built. The MGB
production plant at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, closed in 1980 with the loss of
more than 1,000 jobs when the marque was killed off by former British
Leyland chairman Sir Michael Edwardes.
The new model is also intended to resurrect the MG name in public awareness,
as the precursor to the probable resumption of large-scale production of
sports cars from the mid 1990s.
Rover has refused to confirm details of its model programmes for the middle
of this decade, however, it is widely believed to have finalised
specification and production plans for a small sports car that could be in
production within three years of financial approval being given.
Production of only 15 RV8s a week is planned and deliveries will not start
until early next year. The cars will be assembled at Rover's Cowley plant,
which has had more than Pounds 130m spent on flexible production systems and
manufactures the Rover 800, Maestro, Montego and yet-to-be-launched Synchro
model.
The RV8 has a new outer body shape from the MGB, but its main body structure
is almost identical to that of the old car. It will be produced using partly
original tooling - some of it rescued from dumps after the Abingdon plant
was dismantled. The bodyshells are produced by British Motor Heritage, a
subsidiary of Rover Group set up four years ago to supply remanufactured MGB
bodies to the enthusiast aftermarket.
The MG name remains extremely valuable to Rover, particularly in North
America. The US was once the largest market for MGs, and the name is one of
the few in the former British Leyland stable that appears not to have been
affected by the ignominious withdrawal from North America first of Rover and
then Rover's Sterling subsidiary in the 1980s as a result of declining sales
and a poor reputation for quality. Currently, only Range Rovers are sold in
the region.

FT  13 OCT 92 / DTI to query photocopier sales tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is to raise with the Office of Fair
Trading renewed allegations of unscrupulous sales tactics by photocopier
salesmen.
The move follows a meeting last week between Baroness Denton, the DTI
minister responsible for consumer affairs, and members of the Campaign to
Clean Up Copier Contracts, which has the support of the Confederation of
British Industry.
More than 1,500 companies have complained to the campaign about very high
hidden costs in 'copy plan' contracts, which amalgamate the capital and
running costs of photocopiers into a single charge and charge customers on a
'per copy' basis.
There have been allegations that some finance companies add the concealed
cost of settling earlier photocopier agreements to the cost of new capital
equipment.
Many companies complain that they are unwittingly signing leasing deals
lasting up to nine years for equipment with a three-year life. Any variation
in copier requirements can mean that the contract period starts again.
The campaign leaders told Baroness Denton that, in spite of an OFT
investigation into the activities of one photocopier distributor in 1991 and
attempts by some trade organisations to enforce new codes of conduct in the
leasing market, evidence remains of widespread malpractice involving
photocopy contracts.
The OFT says it will consider revoking consumer credit licences if
leasing-contract abuses are discovered.
Lady Denton has been given a portfolio of cases alleging misrepresentation
and possible fraud.
She is being pressed to pursue changes in the law to offer companies a
two-week 'cooling off' period once contracts are signed.
The campaign also wants businesses to have the same protection available to
individuals under the Consumer Credit Act.
The campaign has announced the establishment of a panel of lawyers and
accountants who will analyse complaints, identify the biggest offenders and
provide advice on how contracts can be challenged.
The DTI confirmed that the issue would be discussed at its next scheduled
meeting with the OFT.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Carlton TV ready to take on franchise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON Television, winner of the London weekday franchise, put on a glitzy
face yesterday for its first presentation to advertisers at the London
Palladium.
Carlton will take over from Thames Television at midnight on January 1 and
is putting Pounds 92m into the ITV national network schedule plus Pounds 11m
into regional programmes apart from a Pounds 7m contribution to setting up a
seven-days-a-week news operation with London Weekend Television.
Mr Nigel Warmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television, promised to offer
'both continuity and change'. The changes include a daily one-hour magazine
programme about life in the capital. There is continuity in the reappearance
of entertainers such as Dave Allen and the transformation of Nicholas
Parsons and his radio programme Just A Minute into a television programme.
Current affairs will include a documentary on Vietnam 20 years after the
Paris Treaty and there will be education in the form of the Good Sex Guide.
The typographical Carlton, the designers have decreed, will in future will
have a small 't' tucked into the capital 'L' and the company will be branded
on screen by 70 people, famous and not so famous, emphasising the theme
'Television For London'.
Ms Christine Walker, chief executive of Zenith Media, the UK's largest media
buyer, and one of those appearing in the Television For London promotions,
was relieved at what she saw yesterday. She said: 'I was afraid they would
go for designer television. They haven't. It's safe but I don't think
they'll match the ratings of Thames this year.'
Not surprisingly, the franchise losers have been maximising their audience
figures and their advertising earnings in their final year as broadcasters.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Buyers are attracted by garden ornament auction: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALEROOMS are kept busy these days selling off the stock of dealers.
That is partly because of bankruptcies in the recession and partly - as in
the case of the long-established T. Crowther &amp; Sons, of Fulham, London -
through companies deciding to call it a day.
The Crowthers have long dominated the world of antique garden ornaments and
architectural furnishings and a cadet branch will continue to trade as
Crowthers of Syon Lodge.
About 1,500 items from stock are being auctioned over three days by
Christie's on the Crowther premises at 282 North End Road, and the first
morning brought a packed courtyard, with many new faces among more than 400
registered buyers. The opening session totalled Pounds 173,000, well over
the high estimate of Pounds 153,000, and was 98 per cent sold.
A Regency mahogany partner's library table, or large kneehole desk, was
within estimate at Pounds 17,600 and a Derbyshire Blue John urn, 20in high,
of the late 18th century, beat its forecast at Pounds 7,150.
A modern pine library bookcase in the style of George III more than doubled
its estimate at Pounds 6,820 and an inlaid mahogany dwarf sideboard of the
early 19th century realised Pounds 5,720.
The auction seems destined to prove that even in an art market recession
objects with a good provenance sell well.
Another market where demand remains good is the specialist field of
banknotes. Spinks sold the George Webber collection for more than Pounds
220,000. A specimen five shillings from an issue destroyed in November 1919,
believed to be unique, doubled its estimate at Pounds 12,980.

FT  13 OCT 92 / DoT computer service privatisation plan expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is expected to announce plans in the next few days to
privatise DVOIT, the organisation that provides computer services to the
Department of Transport and its executive agencies.
Based in Swansea, DVOIT has about 500 employees providing computing services
to the Department of Transport and its agencies. Its largest customer is the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which registers and licenses drivers
and vehicles and collects vehicle excise duty.
DVOIT also processes data for the Department of Transport and two of its
other agencies, the Vehicle Inspectorate and the Driving Standards Agency.
Its three mainframe computers can be accessed from some 4,000 terminals in
200 offices throughout the UK.
DVOIT was made a government executive agency in April, shortly before the
general election. Mr Christopher Chope, then a junior transport minister,
said that he hoped it would develop 'a more commercial style of operation .
. . to pave the way for privatisation in a few years' time'.
Immediately after the general election, a review was established into the
method and timing of privatising DVOIT. The resulting report is now with
ministers. A decision to proceed with privatisation much sooner than
expected likely within days.
With much of the government's IT work likely to be put out to tender in the
next year, DVOIT would be the first of almost 80 government executive
agencies to be privatised.
Like other agencies, DVOIT has been encouraged to compete for new work to
augment income. As long as it remains an agency, however, it cannot compete
outside the public sector.
'If we are privatised, we would be able to compete just like any other
company,' said Mr Tony Fitzgerald, DVOIT's business development manager.
'We are keen to get into new markets and with other government IT divisions
likely to be privatised in the future, we would rather be at the forefront
in getting the new business,' he said.
The consultants who prepared the report are believed to have approached a
number of companies in the private sector to see if they would be interested
in buying the agency. Companies likely to bid for DVOIT include EDS-Scicon,
Hoskyns and Sema.

A DOWNGRADE and bearish comment from broker Nomura knocked Bass, shares in
the brewery group retreating 14 to 548p on heavy turnover of 1.7m. Nomura
lopped Pounds 35m from its full-year forecast to Pounds 495m and warned that
the brewing industry was on the verge of a damaging price war as the leading
protagonists sought to protect market share.
Analyst Mr Ron Littleboy believes the cost of such a policy will mean that
Bass will have to make further exceptional charges of Pounds 25m above the
Pounds 50m already pencilled into most City forecasts. He said: 'Bass is
clearly signalling that it will do everything needed to maintain its
position in a shrinking drinks market. We have the makings of an extreme
price war between the big five, with no one prepared to lose market share.'
He added that he expected the volatile situation to last into the medium
term, keeping selected brewery shares under pressure, in particular Scottish
and Newcastle, off 6 yesterday at 416p.
Lucas volatile
Shares in aerospace and automotive components group Lucas Industries had a
volatile session in heavy turnover of 6.4m, making one of the day's most
heavily traded stocks. The shares jumped 10 to 100p early in the day, with
the market relieved by a maintained final dividend of 4.9p against earlier
fears of a cut, and profits of Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 82.8m) ahead of the
predicted figure of Pounds 20m. The market was also pleased with
restructuring plans at the company.
Lucas said it hoped to report a covered maintained dividend for the current
year, although Mr Sandy Morris at County NatWest warned: 'It is going to be
another difficult year, mainly due to the weak European car market, so I
still think the dividend is at risk.' He predicted full-year profits of
Pounds 41.5m. Mr John Goldschmidt at Charterhouse Tilney was 'on balance
more optimistic' on the outlook for the company and predicted current-year
profits of Pounds 60m.
Recent bid speculation surrounding Lucas continued to circulate and some
analysts likened their meeting with the company yesterday to a defence
meeting. Profit-takers moved in during the afternoon, causing the shares to
surrender some earlier gains. They closed 4 up at 94p, on high turnover of
6.4m.
Rank reversal
Adverse press comment and rumours of further disposals sent Rank
Organisation tumbling, although turnover was below average. The press
comment reiterated market nervousness over Rank's large debt and brought
back whispers of the possibility of a rights issue. There were also strong
suggestions that Rank had put its Odeon cinema chain and film distribution
company up for sale. Bears in the market described the alleged move as a
fire sale brought about by Rank's inability to sell its hotel chain, which
has been on the market for several months.
Ms Lisa Gordon at County NatWest said: 'This just points to the plight of
the company in having to try and sell its way out of debt. The problem for
Rank is that there are no buyers.' However, Mr Peter Hilliar at BZW was more
supportive of the stock, arguing that there had been no new trading news on
Rank and that the bearish sentiment had been overdone. The shares fell 14 to
507p.
Shares in defence and motor cars group Vickers tumbled on news that it had
lost out on a Dollars 1bn Kuwaiti order for its Challenger 2 tank to General
Dynamics of the US.
The shares gave up 7 to 83p in early trading on the news and steadied
mid-session before again retreating, with turnover reaching 1.2m by the
close. The news was not a surprise to the City as reports of the tank's
underper-formance in recent trials in the Middle East have been circulating,
and have been a factor in underperformance of the stock.
Lasmo received a push from consideration of a Hoare Govett re-evaluation.
Hoare has published a note arguing for an average sterling exchange rate of
Dollars 1.56 next year. The house says that, on that figure, Lasmo would
have an asset value of 185p per share and be at a 20 per cent yield premium
to the market on a maintained dividend covered by earnings. Lasmo firmed 2
1/2 to 167p.
Shares in Kwik Save leapt 19 to 693p on hopeful speculation that the recent
interest by Hongkong Land in Trafalgar House might rub off on the
supermarket group. Jardine Matheson, which has a 33 per cent stake in
Hongkong Land, also has a large share in Dairy Farm, which in turn holds
some 25 per cent in Kwik Save. Early talk had Dairy Farm increasing its
stake to the allowable limit of 29.9 per cent.
Lloyds Bank showed signs of slippage as the market absorbed a sell
recommendation from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. The house argued that the shares
were overvalued and on 'a higher rating than its competitors, which is not
justified by its performance. We estimate this overvaluation to be of the
order of Pounds 1 a share.' Lloyds closed 4 firmer at 450p.
TV group Carlton Communications performed well with the help of a buy
recommendation from SG Warburg Securities. Carlton rose 8 to 668p.
Interest ahead of interim figures today, and a buy recommendation, saw
Mirror Group jump 7 to 65p. There is a broad consensus among financial
analysts who predict profits of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 18m. However,
there is a general feeling that, because of the lack of credibility
surrounding the former publisher, Mr Robert Maxwell, estimates were lower
than necessary. Agency Broker James Capel is looking for Pounds 13m and has
put the stock firmly back on its buy list.
Bathroom supplier Spring Ram saw heavy turnover as one house traded blocks
of 3.4m and 4.3m shares at 128p and 129p respectively. The shares eased 3 to
129p on turnover of nearly 9m, the heaviest in the London market.
Caution surrounding a health conference in California was said to have
contributed to weakness in Wellcome, which fell 9 to 963p. The
anti-infectives conference is today expected to discuss prospects for 3TC,
an Aids drug being developed for rival Glaxo. Glaxo hopes 3TC will emerge
from clinical trials as the first commercially successful alternative to
Wellcome's Retrovir.
Changes to indices
Two new indices in the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices are published in
today's FT. The new indices are:
The FT-SE Mid 250, covering the 250 companies that rank below the FT-SE 100
in market capitalisation.
The FT-SE Actuaries 350, the top 350 UK shares (the FT-SE 100 plus the FT-SE
Mid 250). Industry baskets based on these 350 stocks are calculated in real
time throughout the day. The sector classification is that used in the
FT-Actuaries All-Share index.
The FT's display of indices changes as a result. At the top right-hand
corner of this page, a new table brings together all the UK components of
the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices: the FT-SE 100, the FT-SE Mid 250, the
FT-SE Actuaries 350, the FT-Actuaries All-Share index, and some of the FT-SE
Actuaries 350 Industry Baskets.
Other UK equity market indicators - including the FT Ordinary Share Index,
the FT Gold Mines index and the London Stock Exchange volume statistics -
can be found in a new table that appears towards the bottom of this page.
Both the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 and 200 indices will appear from today on the
World Stock Markets page.
Fixed-interest data - including the FT-Actuaries Fixed Interest Indices, FT
Government Securities Index, FT Fixed Interest Index and FT Index of
Gilt-Edged Bargains - can be found on the capital markets page, next to the
Liffe equity options table. The table on the page headed 'Traditional
options - 3-month call rates' will appear in future once a week, on
Saturdays. The table summarising the previous day's traditional options
business will continue to appear daily, as before.

FT  13 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DERIVATIVES market had one of its quietest days in recent sessions with
very poor turnover and little in the way of features to prise dealers away
from the sidelines, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the first trade in the December contract on the
FT-SE was struck at a poor 2,568.
Sporadic buying, mainly from independent traders known as 'locals', on the
back of speculation of a cut in interest rates sent December gently forward
so that by 10.45 the contract had reached 2,595 in very light trading.
However, that talk faded over the lunch time period leaving the contract to
decline and then languish with a bout of sideways trading.
December picked up in the afternoon, gaining momentum on the back of a
strong Wall Street and strength in other European markets which sent the
contract to the day's high of 2,610 just before the market close. Following
some profit-taking, December closed at 2,604, around 14 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 32. Turnover was very thin
reaching a meagre 5,604 contracts.
Traded options business was even more dull with volume reaching only 17,500
contracts with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for a mere 5,896 of the day's
total.
Asda was the most actively dealt stock option at 4,712 contracts and was
followed by British Steel at 1,000 lots.

FT  13 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally after uncertain start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRM opening by Wall Street came to the rescue of a London market
suffering from an acute bout of inactivity as the chancellor of the
exchequer endured a detailed examination of his economic policy by the House
of Commons Treasury committee.
Market strategists ascribed a late strong run by London's equity market to a
squeeze on short positions and to an unexpectedly firm opening by Wall
Street after the three candidates in the race to the White house met in a
televised debate.
Some market commentators in London remained convinced that moves to lower
interest rates in Germany and the US may take place later this week. There
was more uncertainty, however, over the timing of another cut in UK interest
rates.
The equity market opened on a depressed note, with dealers demoralised by
two bleak surveys of the UK's financial services and manufacturing
industries, and last Friday's poor performance by Wall Street, which closed
at its lowest level this year.
Sentiment was also unsettled by a series of worrying corporate stories.
Lucas Industries, the electrical and engineering the components
manufacturer, delivered the expected steep fall in profits along with a
programme of restructuring involving asset sales and heavy job losses.
Vickers was also highlighted as its shares plummeted in reaction to news
that the group had lost out to the US in its attempt to win a Pounds 1bn
order to supply its Challenger tanks to Kuwait.
Opening five points down at 2,535.6, the Footsie quickly retreated to show a
10 point-plus fall within 30 minutes. A good rally, said to have been
triggered by aggressive buying of the Footsie Future, soon developed,
however, and the index was in positive territory shortly after 10am.
There was then very little genuine business in the markets until Wall Street
began trading and the UK chancellor faced the Commons Treasury committee.
Wall Street was quickly into its stride and showing a gain of 30 points
following reports that Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal
Reserve, refused to rule out further cuts in the discount rate ahead of the
November 3 election. And hopes persist in London that the Bundesbank will
soon sanction another reduction in German interest rates, although a cut
this week is viewed as unlikely by one leading UK securities house.
The interrogation of Mr Lamont by the House of Commons Committee was seen as
an anti-climax by market observers. 'Nothing unexpected,' said the top
trader at a leading UK securities house, while another said the examination
had been 'overhyped' by the media.
By the close of business the Footsie was 17.7 higher at 2,558.9. The rise
was not, however, accompanied by any surge in demand; turnover was a paltry
305.6m shares, the lowest since early September.
The two new FT-SE indices, made their official market debuts. The Footsie
Mid index of 250 stocks closed 10.1 higher at 2,403.0 and the Footsie 350,
comprising the Footsie 100 plus the Mid 250 index, moved up 7.1 to 1,230.4.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Hopes for Bundesbank rate cut begin to
evaporate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets lost ground yesterday as investors' faith
in a German interest rate cut at this Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting
weakened.
The prospect of European leaders gathering for the Birmingham summit at the
end of the week also left the bond markets uneasy. The general opinion was
that the EC's political leaders could well do more harm than good in the
short term to the cause of closer European integration.
Ten-year German government bonds fell back about a third of a point as the
market decided that recent optimism about Bundesbank easing may have been
overdone.
The possibility of a substantial supply of new bonds in the coming months is
also dampening the enthusiasm of the market, with some DM40bn of this year's
deficit still to be funded. In addition, a court ruling on income tax
allowances, expected imminently, could add further to supply if, as
expected, it forces Bonn to raise allowances for the lower-paid, thus
cutting tax revenue.
On Liffe, the bund futures contract fell from 91.10 to 90.76 by the close on
the general fall-off. The Euro-Mark futures contract on Liffe, meanwhile,
reflected the lowering of expectation of a rate cut, with the December
contract discounting a rate of 8 1/3 per cent by the end of the day,
compared with 8 1/4 per cent at the opening. That is still well below
current market levels, though, suggesting that there could be a sharp market
correction, said Mr George Magnus, an economist at SG Warburg in London.
LONGER-dated UK government bonds also lost some ground yesterday, although
short-dated paper rose as expectations grew of a  1/2 -point cut in interest
rates later this week. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, failed to provide
any new stimulus for the gilt market as he appeared to answer questions
before MPs, and no further indication of the direction of UK economic policy
is now expected until the chancellor's annual Mansion House speech at the
end of the month.
Data due out during the rest of this week are all expected to point to the
possibility of lower interest rates: producer prices today, industrial
production on Wednesday and employment on Thursday. The figures are all
expected to show a deepening of the UK recession, and with the foreign
exchange market already pricing in a rate cut, the government is widely
expected to take the opportunity to pull the base rate down from its current
9 per cent level - where it continues to sit above German money market
levels.
The long gilt futures contract on Liffe slid from 96 21/32 at the opening to
96 5/32 late in the day, while the benchmark 9 per cent gilts due 2008 lost
 1/16 point to close at 98 1/16 .
OTHER European markets generally fell in line with Germany, marking time
before the Birmingham summit. Some markets, such as France, Denmark and even
Italy, are said to be attracting greater interest as investors come to focus
on their relative cheapness against bunds (their yield spreads against
10-year German government bonds now stand at 110, 186 and 711 basis points
respectively).
However, with the European markets still anticipating a further realignment
in the exchange rate mechanism, few are willing yet to buy these markets on
the argument that they look cheap, said Mr Stephen Lewis, economist at the
London Bond Broking Company.
WITH Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, travelling to Japan
this week, some market commentators have sniffed the possibility of
co-ordinated action to bring down interest rates on both sides of the
Pacific. Mr Greenspan's comments that the Fed could act before the
presidential election next month has also raised hopes in some quarters.
With the Fed having failed to take the opportunity to cut last week,
however, there remains little indication that it will act now. And for its
part, the Bank of Japan remains neutral on the question of any ODR cut,
despite little sign that the economic package to stimulate the economy is
having any effect. With the Tokyo stock market having stabilised at around
the 17,000 level, there is also little immediate pressure on the
authorities. The US markets were closed yesterday for the Columbus day
holiday, while in Japan the benchmark bond No 145 eased slightly to close at
yield of 4.87 per cent.
Two Japanese second-tier brokerages are closing some overseas offices as a
part of rationalisation plans in the face of a sluggish stock market at
home, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Sanyo Securities closed its Los Angeles
branch on October 9 and will close its Bahrain office on October 30.
Okasan Securities is closing its Frankfurt office on Monday.

FT  13 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bratislava to set up options
and futures exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S OM group has agreed with a consortium of Slovak companies to set up
a futures and options exchange in Bratislava, the first of its type in
eastern Europe.
The move is being made to help domestic funds and private investors manage
the risks associated with equity investments as Slovakia embarks on an
extensive privatisation process.
As eastern European countries rush to buy 'off-the-peg' stock markets,
Slovakia is the first to buy a ready-built derivatives market.
Yesterday's announcement prompted questions from derivatives experts about
whether such a market could succeed. Slovakia does not yet have a formal
stock exchange, let alone the liquid stock exchange normally considered a
pre-requisite for a successful derivatives market.
'Having your own derivatives exchange - or even your own stock market - is
getting to be like having your own airline. Everyone wants one, but they
can't all survive,' one expert said.
Mr Bjorn Unger, president of OM Systems International AB, said the options
market was being established first because current Slovak legislation
prohibited the sale of shares for the first year they are held.
'This has created a need, mainly among institutional investors, to manage
the risks inherent in their investments,' he stated.
The exchange will be called the Bratislava Options Exchange, and OM hopes it
will be operating by the middle of next year.
The Swedish group will deliver the system and know-how for the exchange. At
the same time, it will take 30 per cent of the exchange's initial Kcs60m
(Dollars 2.2m) capital, with the balance being held by leading companies
from Slovak industry.
Trading will be conducted by telephone and clearing will be handled
centrally on the exchange.
Mr Unger expects that the participants will be confined to domestic mutual
funds and private investors at first, although he believes foreign groups
may eventually take part. Initially, dealing will take place in up to 10
privatised companies.
The privatisation process is already underway in Slovakia, with coupons
being purchased by private investors and institutions. But the first wave of
Slovak companies is not expected to be in the private sector before the end
of this year.
Mr Unger dismissed suggestions that investors in Slovakia would be too
unsophisticated to make use of the exchange, saying 'education is a problem
we meet almost everywhere'.
Slovakia is currently break ing away from the Czech lands, but this had had
no impact on the exchange project, Mr Unger said.
OM, which conducts exchange and clearing operations in Sweden and the UK,
has previously delivered systems and know-how to futures and options markets
in Finland, France, Norway, Spain and Austria.

FT  13 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Heavyweight borrowers concentrate on
the D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOVEREIGN and supranational borrowers with growing funding needs to meet are
focusing their attention on the D-Mark sector of the Eurobond market, one of
the few where large financings can still be completed.
Sweden announced a DM2bn offering of five-year bonds, due to be priced today
at an indicated yield spread of 45 to 50 basis points over the German BOBL
(short-term government bond).
The fixing of the price by consensus between underwriters is a new mechanism
for the German market, and is designed to help improve the market's
transparency.
In addition, the European Investment Bank launched a DM1bn issue of 10-year
bonds, and Compagnie Bancaire, the French financial group, launched a DM250m
five-year deal via Commerzbank.
The flow of issues in the D-Mark market is expected to continue through the
coming weeks. A number of sovereign borrowers, including Norway, Finland,
Italy and Spain are also considering tapping the market.
In addition, the UK has been in discussions with German banks about a D-Mark
financing, as part of its Ecu10bn international financing package announced
last month.
The flight of capital into the safe haven of the Bund market last month has
benefited D-Mark Eurobonds, but the sector must now convince international
institutional investors that it can offer adequate liquidity.
'This is just the beginning of the era of D-Mark Eurobonds,' said one German
syndicate manager. 'The market will supersede the Ecu sector.'
The capacity of the market could be tested by an onslaught of paper, but
demand seems to be holding up so far.
Dresdner Bank and Morgan Stanley, joint lead managers of Sweden's offering,
reported strong demand from central banks, international institutions and
domestic fund managers.
The indicated spread over German government bonds reflects worries about
Sweden's economic problems, according to bankers.
In addition, the bonds offer a spread of about 15 basis points over
Schuldscheine yields, which should help attract German investors.
Sweden has an ambitious SKr110bn funding programme, although there is no set
time limit for raising this amount. The Kingdom is already increasing the
size of its US commercial paper programme from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 9bn
and its Euro-commercial paper programme from Dollars 3bn to Dollars 6bn,
according to Ms Christine Holm, a director of the Swedish debt office. In
addition, Sweden's shelf registration for the issuance of bonds in the US
market is expected to be increased from its current size of Dollars 1.2bn.
However, today's offering is the first bond issue since the funding target
was set. 'We will not be in the market every week, but our ambition is to
return for further funding,' said Ms Holm.
The pricing of the EIB's 10-year issue arranged by WestLB was more
aggressive, having been based on competitive bids by banks. The bonds
offered only a slight yield pick-up over the 10-year Bund yield.
Even then, the deal illustrated the increase in funding costs for the EIB,
since it lost its tax-exempt status in Italy last month. The cost of the
deal, in floating-rate terms, was around 38 basis points below the London
interbank offered rate, an increase of 50 basis points.
Both the Sweden and the EIB deals are expected to become trading benchmarks
in the sector.
Elsewhere, the World Bank is preparing to launch its long-awaited Y200bn
global bond offering later this week. The deal is arranged by Daiwa, Goldman
Sachs and Nomura.
In the domestic sterling market, the Housing Finance Corporation, which
funds housing trusts, added a Pounds 80m tranche to its existing issue of 11
1/2 per cent bonds due 2016.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Mixed signals for franchise in privatised BR: The government
yesterday launched a consultation exercise to find out what would tempt the
private sector to take over British Rail's passenger trains after
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER wanted to run a railway? Many, apparently, do. According to Mr John
MacGregor, the transport secretary, no fewer than 50 companies have
expressed an interest in taking franchises to operate British Rail's
passenger services after privatisation.
The big question is whether they will still want to do so once they know
what it involves. A 168-page consultation paper published yesterday is
intended not just to tell them what franchising might mean, but to ask them
if they think it will work.
The basics of rail privatisation were set out in a white paper last July. A
BR subsidiary called Railtrack will continue to own the railway tracks, but
the operation of BR's passenger services will be franchised out to
private-sector companies.
In addition, other companies will be allowed to run trains in competition
with those operated by franchisees.
Fleshing out those bones, yesterday's consultation paper says that
franchising will be undertaken progressively, not in a single 'big bang'.
Assuming royal assent for a privatisation bill next summer, the aim is to
franchise a 'substantial' proportion of passenger services in the lifetime
of the current parliament, with the bidding starting in 1994.
The franchise areas, as expected, will broadly resemble BR's 19 existing
profit centres - for example, InterCity's West Coast main line, or Network
SouthEast's Thames &amp; Chiltern division. Other configurations, or even
individual services, may be franchised provided the effect is not to leave
BR with a rump of unviable odds and ends.
Franchises will be awarded on the basis of competitive tendering. In the
case of the profitable InterCity operations, franchises will go to the
highest bidders, while in the case of loss-making Network SouthEast and
Regional Railways services, the winners will be those companies which
require the lowest subsidies.
After that, franchisees will rent or buy their rolling stock from BR and
start making money - or losing it. They will bear the full commercial risk
of their operations, paying track charges, rolling stock rentals, wages and
other operating costs out of fare revenues and hoping they are left with a
profit.
As a result, employee concerns about privatisation seem justified. If
franchisees are to make money, they will need to cut costs, and the
consultation paper says they will be free to change employees' working
conditions once the franchise is under way.
'Bids would therefore need to reflect the costs of making these changes,
including redundancy costs if staff are planned to be replaced or overall
numbers reduced,' the paper says.
Passengers are assured that loss-making services will continue to be
subsidised; that franchisees will be required to provide a specified minimum
level of services; and that operators failing to deliver acceptable
standards of service will face penalties up to and including the loss of the
franchise.
On fares, as on many other points, the paper is vague. It says that
franchisees will be free to set their own fare levels, raising the
possibility of stiff increases on some services. But it also says this power
will be restricted 'where rail enjoys significant market power', suggesting
that Network SouthEast fares will stay under political control.
The future of stations, too, is shrouded in mystery. The paper says
franchisees might want to operate the stations lying on their routes.
Alternatively, a developer might wish to acquire the right to develop them.
Then again, 'there could be scope for joint ventures'.
The paper fails to resolve some issues of acute concern to would-be
franchisees. One question is whether they will face competition from 'cherry
pickers' - free-wheeling operators grabbing traffic from the franchisee's
most profitable services.
Ministers say that, in practice, the opportunities for competition on the
rails are likely to be limited by shortages of train paths. Nevertheless,
the consultation paper reaffirms the government's commitment to open access.
Would-be franchisees are therefore left wondering how they are to frame
their bids when they cannot be sure how much competition they will face.
Mr MacGregor's answer to all such questions yesterday was that the point of
the exercise was to find out the private sector's views before reaching
conclusions. Even then, different passenger services had different
characteristics, so there could be no universal template.
'We have taken a quite deliberate decision not to lay down a rigid blueprint
for franchises,' he said. 'The private sector may well want to suggest
different approaches to different types of service and I want to make sure
that the franchising system is flexible enough to accommodate their ideas.'
Would-be train operators have only a month to respond to the document: the
exercise ends on November 12.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Canary Wharf banks seek more time over Tube cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATORS of Canary Wharf, the financially troubled east London
property development, asked the Government last night for time to revise
their offer of a contribution to the costs of building the Jubilee Line Tube
extension.
The administrators, three partners of the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young,
met Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, who is chairing a government
committee on London Docklands. They were accompanied by Lord Griffiths, Lady
Thatcher's former adviser, who is now international adviser at Goldman
Sachs, the US investment bank working for the administrators.
The administrators and Canary Wharf's 11 commercial banks had faced a
deadline of the end of September for making an offer of private-sector funds
for the Tube project. Yesterday they sought a later deadline for two
reasons.
First, they had believed that the government was planning to move Department
of Environment officials to Canary Wharf. If the staff are to stay in
central London, as government officials have hinted, the banks need time to
assess the implications.
Second, the administrators had not understood that the government was
opposed in principle to an offer of private-sector funds being conditional
on government support.
Three weeks ago the banks offered Pounds 390m towards the Jubilee Line's
Pounds 1.6bn costs, but the fact that the offer was conditional on civil
servants moving to Canary Wharf made the offer unaccceptable to the
government.

<TEXT>
THE FAMILY of a workman killed in a Channel tunnel accident two years ago
was awarded Pounds 50,000 agreed damages against the consortium constructing
the tunnel, Translink Joint Venture, in the High Court yesterday.
Mr William Cartman, 33, of Washington, Tyne and Wear, was earning more than
Pounds 800 a week as a grouter when the accident happened on May 7 1990. He
was crushed between a moving crane and the fixed steel frame of a boring
machine. Mr Jeffrey Burke QC, for the family, told Judge Adrian Whitfield it
was accepted Mr Cartman was 25 per cent to blame for the accident. Half of
the agreed damages will be shared equally by the couple's two children.

THE LAW Society is considering legal action against Lord Mackay, the Lord

work in magistrates' courts by the end of the year.
Launching a set of compromise proposals in a final attempt to avoid a
head-on clash with the government in the long-running dispute over payment
arrangements for criminal legal aid work, the society said yesterday it
could 'not rule out the possibility of national industrial action'.
The society said Price Waterhouse, management consultants, who had advised
Lord Mackay on his proposals, had acknowledged deficiencies in his scheme,
which replaces hourly pay rates with a two-tier system of standard fees.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Incentives 'too small to boost training'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG PEOPLE often are reluctant to pursue vocational training because the
financial rewards are too small, according to a report published today by
the London School of Economics, Lisa Wood writes.
The report said pay differentials between unskilled workers and those with
low-level vocational qualifications were slim, although people with degrees
or high-level vocational qualifications could command more pay.
'If wages remain high for low and unskilled jobs, why should any one bother
to obtain further training?' the report said.
The authors said differentials were often insufficient to make training
worthwhile, so reluctance to pursue training was often perfectly rational.
The report, paid for by BP, implies that employers over time should hold
down pay rates of the unqualified and raise those of skilled workers. It
could also be interpreted as suggesting that low-level vocational
qualifications are not of a sufficiently high standard to warrant higher
pay.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Car remains most common perk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAR is still the most common perk offered by British companies, although
one in five is now letting employees trade cars for a higher salary.
The findings, published yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry,
indicate that employee benefits have not generally been cut during the
recession, although companies are tightening up on administration costs.
The CBI said it was surprised that perks had survived relatively unscathed,
in view of the heavy costs they added to pay bills. Benefits typically add
10 per cent to 15 per cent to the salary costs of basic-level employees, and
40 per cent to 50 per cent for executives.
At very senior levels, benefits might add up to as much as, or more than,
the salary itself, the CBI said.
The survey was carried out with management consultants Towers Perrin and is
said to be the largest of its kind ever conducted in the UK. More than 600
organisations with a combined workforce of about 3m were questioned.
Almost all companies surveyed - 98 per cent - offer cars to at least some of
their employees. Cars even outstripped pensions, which were provided by 93
per cent of companies, and life assurance, also offered by 93 per cent.
Bottom of the perks league were vouchers for childcare, at 2 per cent, with
on-site creches not far ahead on 4 per cent.
The CBI said the survey highlighted the way benefits policies were lagging
behind changes in the workforce. Companies said the main change in their
workforces was the growth in the number of employees with spouses who were
also earning.
Almost as many cited an increase in employees' average ages and an increase
in the number of women workers.
Companies had not adapted benefits to those changes. In particular, little
account had been taken of the increase in dual-income families, and it was
possible that some benefits were being unnecessarily duplicated.
For example, a majority of companies continued to pay for private medical
insurance cover for spouses when it was possible that those spouses now
qualified for medical cover in their own right. There was also evidence that
older workers valued non-monetary benefits such as being allowed to increase
their supervisory role and act as mentors to younger colleagues, the CBI
said.
Many employers are reviewing their policies on cars because of increasing
costs and because forthcoming Inland Revenue reforms may mean that tax
payments increase by up to 40 per cent for company car drivers. Companies in
the financial sector and those with US parents were leading the field in
substituting cash for company cars or eliminating car schemes altogether,
the survey found.
While many employees were now taking money instead of cars, the same
flexibility was not on offer for other benefits. Pensions were offered on a
flexible basis by 7 per cent of the companies but more than 3 per cent of
employers offered choice on no other perk.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Businessmen in Iraq trade trial deny deceit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry was deceived by three directors of
Matrix Churchill, the Coventry-based machine tool manufacturers, into
believing equipment exported to Iraq was for civilian, not military, use, an
Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
The pretence by the three businessmen was an attempt to evade the ban on the
export of military equipment and sell Iraq machine tools and computer
software to manufacture bomb fuses, Mr Alan Moses QC, prosecuting, said.
Mr Paul Henderson, a former Matrix Churchill managing director, Mr Trevor
Abraham, a former commercial director of the company and Mr Peter Allen, a
former sales director, all deny four counts of breaching export regulations
between July 1988 and August 1990.
Mr Moses, for Customs and Excise, which is bringing the prosecution, said
contracts and other documents showed that the machine tools and software
exported had always been intended for military use.
A report by a Matrix Churchill employee after a visit to Iraq referred to a
fuse project. A contract signed in 1988 between the firm and Industrias
Cardoen, a Chilean company involved in the transaction, referred to fuses to
detonate bombs.
Matrix Churchill supplied a complete package including the training of Iraqi
personnel in the use of the machine tools. Their manufacture was sometimes
sub-contracted to other companies but Matrix Churchill always took
responsibility for seeing that export regulations were adhered to, Mr Moses
said.
However, all three defendants had played parts in deceiving the DTI to get
round the ban on exporting military goods and obtain the necessary export
licences, he said.
They gave false descriptions of the purposes the equipment would be put to
and all three, particularly Mr Henderson, suggested it could be used for
civilian purposes, Mr Moses added. The DTI suspected that the equipment
could be used for military purposes, but had accepted assurances given by
the three directors that the equipment was for civilian use.
The trial, expected to last about eight weeks, continues today.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Shake-up planned for Scots councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT spelt out options yesterday for a drastic reshaping of local
government in Scotland, sweeping away the two-tier structure established in
1974 and creating between 15 and 51 new single-tier councils.
The new system, which would come into effect in 1996, would entail changes
to Scotland's nine regional councils, including the disappearance of
Labour-dominated Strathclyde regional council, which contains nearly half
Scotland's 5m people.
A consultation document presenting options for the single-tier system quotes
the conclusion of Touche Ross, the accountants, that provided there were no
more than 43 councils the new system would lead to long-term savings of
public expenditure.
Initially, the savings would be exceeded by transitional expenses.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the existing system, brought in by the
Conservatives, was inconsistent with the present needs of local government.
It had been designed at a time when the public sector was expected to lead
economic development and deliver a wide range of services.
People wanted to be better able to identify who was responsible. People
found it hard to identify with the large regional authorities and still
often thought of themselves as living in the old counties or burghs.
There was also confusion for many people about which services were provided
by the regional councils and which by the 53 district councils, while there
was some overlap between them.
Launching a consultation process, backed by an explanatory video, Mr Lang
said he wanted a system that reflected local loyalties and was
cost-effective and efficient.
The new councils did not have to be of uniform size and he had 'an open
mind' on the most appropriate structure.
In England, a commission under Sir John Banham is touring the country,
deciding where new authorities should be. The Welsh Office has already
issued a document spelling out where single-tier authorities will be in
Wales.
One of the four options set out in yesterday's green paper for Scotland is
for 15 single-tier authorities. That would allow eight of the regional
councils to remain, absorbing the functions of the districts - Strathclyde
would be split.

FT  13 OCT 92 / MMI in talks with Zurich Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of a solution to the difficulties of Municipal Mutual Insurance rose
yesterday after an announcement that the stricken insurer is in talks with
the Swiss company, Zurich Insurance.
In a joint statement, the two companies said they were 'in talks to provide
ongoing commercial insurance cover for local authorities'.
No binding agreement has yet been reached, and the companies would not say
whether Zurich was offering to assume MMI's existing insurance liabilities.
MMI stopped underwriting new business late last month after earlier rescue
talks with the Paris-based La Garantie Mutuelle des Foncionnaires broke
down.
MMI has been faced with an escalation of claims on its public and employers'
liability business. Its losses in 1991 amounted to more than Pounds 200m.
Zurich, the third-biggest non-life insurer in Europe last year, has
designated the UK as a strategically important market for expansion.
Its existing Portsmouth-based subsidiary, which underwrites both life and
general insurance business, had a 1.1 per cent share of the non-life market
and ranked 20th in size in the general insurance market in 1990.
Mr Dennis White, chief executive of Zurich's UK operations, said: 'There are
still a number of issues, but subject to these being resolved we shall be
able to offer insurance cover to local authorities on realistic terms before
the year-end.'
Zurich is also one of a number of companies discussing with MMI the
provision of private car and home insurance for council employees and other
MMI customers.
Mr Brian Wright, group chief executive of MMI, said that if the plans were
successful 'it would result in a large number of staff at Farnborough and in
regional offices throughout the country continuing with their present jobs
but as part of Zurich Insurance.'
Local-authority associations offered a cautious welcome to the news but said
they would 'need to be satisfied that existing contracts with MMI would be
honoured in full'.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Technology: Living life beyond the limit - Why scientists
and pharmaceuticals companies are searching for the secret of eternal youth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Humans have long been fascinated by the idea of eternally preserving
youthful vitality. Much of Florida was mapped out by the Spanish explorer
Ponce de Leon in his search for the fountain of youth. A few years ago,
Hollywood made a small fortune by exploring the idea of eternal life in the
film Cocoon.
Only in the last few years, however, has the search for youth made the leap
from myth and dreams into scientists' laboratories. After years of
concentrating on specific diseases like heart disease and cancer, some
researchers are turning their attention to an increasingly common cause of
death: old age.
Research on ageing is becoming a hot area for scientists. Human growth
factor, nerve growth factor, DHEA hormone and deprenyl are just a few of the
drugs that have been shown to have an impact on some processes involved in
ageing. But none has been shown to extend life reliably.
The basic mechanisms underlying the process of ageing are still poorly
understood. Researchers do not even agree on such fundamental questions as
whether there is a irreversible biological limit to the human life span. If
there is, it might still be possible to extend the lives of those who die
'prematurely' - before the age of about 85 - but there would be no hope of
keeping significant numbers of people alive beyond 115.
'One reason for the lack of definite progress so far is that ageing offers
not too few, but too many, lines of investigation,' says Tom Kirkwood of the
National Institute for Medical Research in London.
'As we grow older, almost everything in our bodies undergoes some change.
Not only is it difficult therefore to sort out which changes are causes
rather than consequences, but it is not even clear what kinds of causes we
should be looking for,' he says.
Some scientists are searching for genes which may bring about ageing in a
controlled way, like the ones that govern growth from embryo to adulthood.
Some are concentrating on the proteins which maintain the normal working of
cells and which lose their normal patterns of activity in old people. And
some are trying to sort out the myriad of agents, both internal and
external, which damage cells over the course of a lifetime.
Kirkwood rejects the popular idea that 'ageing is good for the species and
that we die as an evolutionary adaptation to make way for new generations'.
Unfortunately, there is no specific life-terminating genetic programme which
scientists might in principle be able to identify and switch off, he says.
Instead, we age because of an accumulation of errors in many cellular repair
mechanisms.
The US National Institute on Ageing (NIA) is funding some of the most
exciting research projects in the field. In one study, Daniel Rudman of the
Medical College of Wisconsin discovered that human growth hormone,
administered to 50 men in a nursing home, seemed temporarily to turn back
the biological clock, improving bone and organ strength and making the men
more physically active.
At one time, human growth hormone was an extremely rare substance, used
exclusively for correcting the dwarf syndrome. Advances in biotechnology
have recently made it possible to make the hormone synthetically. Eli Lilly
and Genentech, two manufacturers of the substance, participated in Rudman's
research.
Although human growth hormone is more plentiful than it once was, it is
still expensive. Rudman's patients would have to pay about Dollars 14,000
(Pounds 7,900) a year for the drug if they were to purchase it individually.
In an attempt to pare down the costs and increase the efficiency of the
treatment, Mitchell Harman of the NIA has taken Rudman's research one step
further. He has created the 'growth hormone releasing hormone', a substance
which stimulates human beings to produce more growth hormone in their own
bodies.
Another drug that has come under scrutiny for its anti-ageing effects is
DHEA, which according to some studies can make faltering immune systems come
alive again. DHEA is a natural hormone which decreases in the body with age.
Experiments with the substance helped spawn the 'morning after' pill, which
contains some DHEA. Today, DHEA is manufactured by several companies,
although it has not been approved for use against ageing in the US.
Scientists also hope that genetic manipulation may help extend life spans.
Geron Corporation in California, for instance, has been studying genes that
may trigger ageing, as well as compounds that may reverse these effects.
Researchers have bred strains of fruit flies that live twice as long as
normal and are identifying the genes responsible. One gene produces an
enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD), which mops up highly reactive chemicals
called free radicals that damage biological tissues. However, scientists
have not yet developed a protective drug that could deliver SOD to the cells
where it is needed.
Oxygen free radicals, in particular, may well be an important factor in
ageing and some doctors believe that anti-oxidants such as vitamins C and E
can help prolong life. If so, the traditional advice for children to eat up
their green vegetables might help them to live longer.
Indeed, eating a controlled diet is still the only method widely believed by
scientists to have a significant impact on lifespan. 'Diet is the only known
way of extending life,' says George Roth of the NIA.
He points to experiments with a range of animals including insects, rats and
monkeys. 'We limit their food intake and give them vitamin supplements. So
we aim for under-nutrition without malnutrition.'
The results from the experiments are astounding. In all cases, a low-caloric
intake was shown to extend the organism's life by about 40 to 50 per cent.
The method has already won over some believers. Roy Walford, who launched
the well-known Biosphere project, is currently experimenting with
under-nutrition on himself.
According to Roth, however, under-nutrition may not be necessary. 'The idea
is to come up with a drug which would have the same impact on the body as
low-caloric intake,' he explained.
Despite progress in the field, many observers believe it will be a long time
before a trip to the local pharmacy includes a stop at the life-extension
counter. Many companies have little incentive to spend money on ageing
research, since many of the substances are naturally-occurring and are
therefore difficult to patent. Another problem is that regulatory
authorities may not be keen to approve the drugs for market.
Anti-ageing drugs may also have serious side effects, the most dangerous of
which could be cancer. Since cancer, or the over-growth of cells, is in some
ways the opposite of ageing, or the under-growth of cells, medical
manipulation may push the body over the edge to malignancy.
Scientists are also concerned about the ethical and financial implications
of anti-ageing drugs. Increasing life span without increasing health span,
for instance, could do more harm than good.
'If we add on years to human life but do nothing to make them more active
during those years, what we are doing is adding to human misery,' says Roth.
'We have to think hard about these questions, or we may end up with 150
year-olds who spent the last 60 years of their life in a nursing home. That
would be a disaster.'

FT  13 OCT 92 / Technology: Tight squeeze putting desktops in a pocket -
Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dozens of high-tech companies in the UK, Japan and the US are scrambling to
produce hand-held computers, driven by a burning desire to put a 'computer
in every palm'. Few of them, however, seem to have grasped the basic
difference between designing a computer that will sit on your desk and one
that will fit in your pocket.
Most are climbing over one another to make hand-held computers that are as
fast, powerful and easy to use as today's desktop systems. But in order to
meet the size requirements of a hand-held computer, manufacturers are using
miniaturised versions of old technologies.
The problem is that yesterday's hardware - even when it is updated and
shrunk until it fits into the palm of your hand - will not run the latest PC
software.
Rather than recognising this limitation - and rethinking their design
strategy - many makers of pint-sized PCs are forcing users to accept these
abbreviated versions of their desktop PC software. Even big companies such
as Atari, Memorex and Fujitsu have gone this route.
There are five big limitations that have prevented hand-held systems from
achieving the same power as their desktop brethren: memory, storage space,
processor speed, display quality and keyboard size.
On most systems, memory and storage space are provided by 'solid state',
battery-backed memory chips - and the restriction lies in the number of
chips which can be squeezed into one tiny machine. This part of the equation
may improve slightly with the advent of ultra-small, magnetic disk drives
such as Hewlett-Packard's recently launched 1.8-inch diameter disk drive -
but these also carry a price in terms of power consumption.
Meanwhile, the processor speed of hand-held machines is increasing more
quickly than in desktop systems. But these faster processors will take a few
years before they can reach the power of today's desktops. And they will
always lag behind due to the physical dimensions of hand-held machines.
Display quality and keyboard size are also limited by the size of your
wallet - and the size of your fingers. While there are some creative
alternatives to the keyboard - such as voice or pen-based machines - these
fall outside the mainstream PC world.
And therein lies the problem. Although it may be technologically possible
one day to fit a full-blown desktop PC into a computer small enough to fit
in your pocket, this is not what most people want.
Rather, they desire a tool which will help them access vital information
that is needed when they are out of the office - and which carries with it
the capability to send and retrieve information from that office or others.
Some companies - such as HP's 95LX, Japanese electronics giant Sharp's
popular 'IQ' or ' Wizard' range and Psion's 18-month old Series 3 hand-held
computer - have recognised this and are reaping the benefits of having done
so.
Pocket-sized computers are simply a different kind of product. Unlike the
general-purpose desktop PC they need to be geared to the special needs of
certain users.
We already have pocket-sized 'organisers' such as the Sharp Wizzard, and
pocket-sized computer games such as the Nintendo Gameboy. What next? A word
processor for those on the move or a facsimile machine that fits in your
pocket are possibilities.
The breakthrough in hand-held computing will, however, come with the ability
to build wireless communications into a pocket-sized computer at a
mass-market price. We already have cellular telephones that fit in your
pocket and a few computers that are pocket sized. What we need is a single
unit that combines both.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Chancellor criticises two reports in Financial Times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE Treasury committee hearing, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
criticised two reports that appeared in yesterday's Financial Times.
The first referred to a meeting on September 13 between Mr Lamont and
Treasury officials and said the officials had broached the possibility that
sterling might devalue, along with the Italian lira. The report said that
the issue was raised as an option by Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at
the Treasury.
The second report said Mr Lamont had told Treasury officials to put a more
favourable gloss on official projections for the UK's public-sector deficit,
published a month before the April general election.
Mr Lamont was asked about both reports at the committee meeting. This is a
transcript of the exchanges:
Mr Giles Radice (Labour MP for Durham North): 'There's a report in today's
Financial Times which says: 'It has emerged that, during the September 13
meeting at the UK Treasury, British officials briefly broached the
possibility that sterling could join in the Italian devaluation.
' 'The issue was raised at the meeting by Sir Terry Burns, permanent
secretary at the Treasury, as an option, according to UK officials, but any
likelihood that sterling would follow the lira by devaluing was, however,
immediately scotched by Mr Lamont.'
'So clearly there was a possibility that there could have been a devaluation
and you were advised that there was a possibility by your officials, but you
chose not to go down that route. Isn't that the case?'
Mr Lamont: 'No. That is not the case.'
Mr Radice: 'So it's wrong?'
Mr Lamont: 'Well, I haven't actually had the benefit of reading that
report.'
Mr Radice: 'You don't read the FT?'
Mr Lamont: 'I sometimes read the FT, but I haven't currently been reading it
and I certainly think that many of the things that it has written on these
events are highly inaccurate and intended to be so. They seem to be
extremely out to create a bit of problems here and there.
'Mr Chairman, I will only say that at the meeting on Sunday morning . . . I
haven't read this article . . . so I don't know which meeting it is
referring to.'
In a later exchange:
Mr Brian Sedgemore (Labour, Hackney and Shoreditch): 'Can you respond to the
serious criticism in this morning's Financial Times that perhaps neither
this committee nor anybody else can take anything you say seriously on
economic policy, because you are a dishonest person that gets Treasury civil
servants to fake economic projections and statistics for political purposes,
and I have the Financial Times here, if you would like to read it.'
Mr Lamont: 'That is not correct. I'm afraid that's why I responded rather
sharply about the FT earlier, no doubt unfairly on the FT. All I will say
about that is that it is a very misleading article.
'All forecasts are discussed between ministers and officials. The forecasts
obviously take into account the views of ministers and other senior
officials who are not directly involved in the technical process of running
the Treasury model. The final published forecasts are the responsibility of
ministers, they reflect all the judgments made in the course of these
discussions.
'I think earlier on we sent this committee a memorandum in July of last year
about how the forecast was drawn up and we stand by everything that was in
that.'
Last night the Treasury declined to elaborate on Mr Lamont's comments. Mr
Richard Lambert, editor of the FT, said: 'The paper stands by its reports.'

FT  13 OCT 92 / Five injured in IRA London pub bombing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE people were injured, one seriously, when an IRA bomb exploded in the
heart of London's West End yesterday.
The bomb exploded at lunchtime in a pub in the Covent Garden area. It was
the eighth to explode in the capital over the past week.
It followed a warning nine minutes before the blast to a radio station that
police described as 'deliberately vague and confusing'. The warning used a
recognised IRA codeword and said the bomb had been placed in the 'Leicester
Square area', leaving officers with little time to clear surrounding
buildings.
Although the recent attacks have involved relatively small devices and
caused few casualties, they have been marked by a constant shift in tactics
aimed at stretching police resources while giving maximum publicity to the
IRA.
The bombing campaign coincides with cross-party talks on Northern Ireland's
future involving nationalist and Unionist leaders, but excluding Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA.
Yesterday's bomb was a grim reminder of the pub bombings of the 1970s in
Guildford and Birmingham.
On Saturday a bomb exploded in a telephone box near the high-security
Paddington Green police station, west London, where IRA terrorist suspects
are held. It was followed by an IRA statement warning: 'British military and
political leaders should take this signal of our intentions seriously.' Last
week there were also car-bomb explosions, other minor devices, and a series
of hoaxes.
An RUC officer was slightly injured late last night when a bomb was thrown
at a security patrol in north Belfast.

FT  13 OCT 92 / North-west confidence nosedives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARNING that north-west England faces a serious loss of manufacturing and
business capacity without a significant increase in economic activity was
issued yesterday by the area's chambers of commerce.
The chambers' regular quarterly survey for the July-September period shows a
huge slide in confidence as orders fell sharply. While 34 per cent of
manufacturers expected an improvement in profits in the next 12 months, 33
per cent forecast deterioration. The difference between the two of 1
percentage point is the trend indicator; it was 30 percentage points in
June.
Manchester chamber's economics committee called for a short-term stimulus,
which it said was unlikely to affect inflation much while demand was so low.
It said there would be further serious losses of industrial capacity without
significantly higher activity.
'The deteriorating position is reflected in reduced domestic orders,
continuing low capacity utilisation and poor cash flow,' the committee said.
The survey shows that nearly all improvements in trends in the last 12
months were wiped out. Manufacturing investment has been cut and more than
80 per cent of companies have spare capacity. The study covered 427
manufacturers employing 52,400 people, 289 service-sector companies with
30,600 employees, and 31 businesses not classified by sector employing 5,200
people.
Although service-sector businesses show a 12-point positive balance - 39 per
cent forecasting improvements versus 27 per cent predicting falls - that
contrasts with a 50-point balance for the second quarter.
The slide in business confidence is the result of a marked deterioration in
domestic orders. Only 26 per cent of manufacturers and 31 per cent of
service providers report more orders than in the second quarter, compared
with 44 per cent and 33 per cent respectively, which report falls.
Export sales faltered, with the second quarter's positive balance of 14
percentage points among manufacturers dropping to 3 points.
Employment markets worsened, after five successive quarters of slowdown in
job-shedding. There was a significant drop in the balance figure of
companies expecting to take on more labour - from 7 percentage points to 1
point.
Cash flow difficulties are described as 'serious'. Only 19 per cent of
businesses saw an improvement and 33 per cent saw a deterioration.
The 10 chambers in the survey cover Greater Manchester and Lancashire.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Brussels 'green' charges rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday accused Brussels of acting with insensitivity as it
dismissed claims that the UK will be taken to the European Court of Justice
for three breaches of environmental laws on wild birds and emissions of
nitrous oxide.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, was called to defend the
government's 'green' record at yesterday's relaunch of a campaign to
persuade householders to save energy and help to prevent global warming.
He said: 'We have received no communication whatsoever from the European
Commission on these issues since before the general election in April.' He
thought the disputes had been 'amicably resolved'.
Brussels has sent reasoned opinions to the government - the last step before
court action - for allowing farmers to shoot wild 'pest species' such as
crows, starlings and magpies, and for alleged failure to provide enough
'special protection areas' for wild birds.
A third dispute over the 'failure' to monitor levels of nitrous oxide is
less advanced. Mr Howard said he did not expect any of the arguments to end
in court.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEEDY families and others dependent on social security should not be made to
pay for the 'economic mess' created by government policies, Mr Donald Dewar,
shadow social security secretary, said last night, Ivor Owen writes.
At Guisborough, Cleveland, he said: 'What is needed is a package of measures
to get Britain out of recession, not an attack on the incomes of the
unemployed, pensioners and the disabled.'
Mr Dewar urged the government to recognise that the best way to reduce the
social security budget was to reduce the numbers on the dole by ensuring
there were chances for them to secure creative employment. He strongly
criticised the speech by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, at last
week's Conservative party conference in which he condemned people he said
cheated to claim social security.
In a letter to the minister, Mr Dewar expressed particular concern about the
implications of his attack on 'young ladies who get pregnant just to jump
the housing list'. Mr Dewar deplored the 'offensive suggestion' that women,
in significant numbers, became pregnant simply to advance up the queue for
housing.
He accused Mr Lilley of showing a lack of understanding of the difficulties
facing lone parents and young couples in Britain today.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Colliery closure details out today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal is expected today to announce the closure of 26 pits in a
sweeping rationalisation plan involving the loss of thousands of jobs.
The closures represent more than half British Coal's remaining 50 pits, and
are part of the reshaping to prepare the company for privatisation.
The closures will cost more than 20,000 jobs, one of the largest set of
redundancies ever announced at once. The government will try to soften the
blow with promises of aid, although the prospects for that are slim given
the present state of the budget.
Although the bulk of the job losses will affect the mining communities,
there will also be many lay-offs among administrative staff.
The announcement will come even though British Coal has yet to sign new
supply deals with the electricity industry on which its prospects now
depend. Negotiations have been delayed by disagreements among the
electricity distributors. However, the government is keen to press ahead
with the privatisation schedule.
British Coal refused to confirm that the closure programme would be
announced today, but Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, are both due to spend the day at their London
offices.
Union leaders in the biggest coalfield decided yesterday to press for a
strike in protest at the planned pit closures. The Yorkshire executive of
the NUM mineworkers' union said the demand was made 'with great reluctance'.
Mr Ken Capstick, NUM Yorkshire area vice-chairman, said: 'We feel industrial
action is needed to protect jobs and mining communities and especially
because many of the redundancies will be compulsory, We are likely to lose
30,000 miners' jobs and another 60,000 in related industries.
'We also envisage 17 coal-fired power stations having to close very
rapidly,' he said.
The NUM Yorkshire area said it would put a motion calling for industrial
action to a special delegate conference in Sheffield on Thursday.
British Coal has been fined Pounds 20,000 with Pounds 6,410 costs for
breaches of the Radioactive Substances Act 1960 relating to radioactive
material held at Marine Colliery, Cwm, Gwent.
The Pollution Inspectorate said that, after the closure of Marine Colliery
there was no record of the fate of a caesium source used on a bunker level
gauge and investigations had failed to discover its fate after the site had
been cleared.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Sterling lending flat, Bank says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING lending to the private sector was virtually flat over the three
months to August, according to the Bank of England.
An analysis of bank lending to UK residents in the three months to the end
of August, published by the Bank, reflects a depressed economy with a
private sector reluctant to accumulate debt.
Foreign currency lending to the private sector fell by 2 per cent, probably
reflecting fears that sterling would have to be devalued as it slipped
against the D-Mark over the summer.
The seasonally adjusted 2 per cent rise in lending to individuals was
dominated by loans for house purchases, prompted by the partial holiday from
stamp duty that ended on August 20.
Industry and commerce reduced borrowings in sterling by 1 per cent. That was
mainly accounted for by sharp drops in borrowing by business and services,
which recorded the fourth successive and biggest fall in sterling lending
for 5 1/2 years.
Lending to property companies has fallen by 5 per cent since early last year
and lending to the construction industry has fallen by 18 per cent since the
start of last year.
Lending to manufacturing industry was flat in the three months to August.
Hotels and catering reduced borrowing by 5 per cent in the three months to
August, the sharpest fall since the series began in February 1987. Lending
to the motor trade dropped by 5 per cent.
The drop in lending for most areas of the private sector was partly offset
by an increase of 22 per cent in sterling lending to the energy and water
supply industries. Most of that went on oil and natural gas extraction.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Consumer hopes dip sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER confidence across the UK fell sharply in the three months before
Black Wednesday, when sterling was suspended from the European exchange rate
mechanism, according to a consumer survey published yesterday.
Business Strategies Limited, the economics consultancy, said the fall
represented the steepest loss of confidence it had found in any three-month
period for five years. It warned that the next four months were critical.
In the survey, carried out with Gallup, the market research company, BSL
says: 'If consumers respond positively to sterling's departure from the ERM
. . . then confidence may bounce back a little with beneficial effect for
hopes of recovery. If, on the other hand, consumers remain depressed, then a
double-dip recession becomes a very real possibility.'
BSL says the effect on consumer attitudes of the pound's departure from the
ERM is unclear - but it is likely to be more ambiguous than announcements of
job losses by British Aerospace, Ford, Rolls-Royce and Vickers, since the
last survey.
The slide in confidence in the general economic situation was most marked in
southern parts of the country and undid a strong rise in confidence recorded
in the three months to July.
BSL says that although in the July survey only Wales and the north-west
expected economic prospects to deteriorate over the coming year, all regions
now expect a 'significant' decline.
Confidence in every region has dropped to levels similar to the early days
of the recession. The difference now is that an early belief that northern
parts of the country would escape the recession is no longer held.
In Scotland, optimism about the economy is falling and concern about
unemployment is rising. In Yorkshire and Humberside, optimism has declined,
reversing many of the gains apparent in the previous survey. In the north,
confidence has plunged over the last three months.
Mr David Fell, BSL principal economist, said there were three main factors
behind the drop in confidence:
The second-quarter survey, which painted a more optimistic picture, was
conditioned by the general election - with people thinking it would end
uncertainty.
The period since the election has been one of bad news. The pound was in
trouble over most of the summer and many redundancies were announced.
The notion that the recovery was going to happen this year evaporated.
Mr Fell said the south-east, which accounts for a third of the economy,
remained the key region. After three months of improving expectations,
respondents now expect their financial situation to worsen over the next few
months. Fewer consumers were managing to save than at any time since the
regional results were collated almost four years ago.
The survey also showed that heavy price discounting had encouraged people to
believe that now is a good time to make big purchases and that consumer
spending rose slightly in most regions over the past three months.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Lamont defends his actions on Black Wednesday: Peter Marsh
outlines the main points that emerged from the chancellor's appearance
yesterday before members of the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVENTS leading up to Black Wednesday, September 16: Mr Lamont said he had
heard nothing since September 16 that pointed to any alternative to the
forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism due to the intense
currency pressures. He said sterling's former central rate in the mechanism
of DM2.95 was not too onerous for Britain. To have raised interest rates
before Black Wednesday would have 'undermined, not strengthened' Britain's
position. 'Frankly, the game was up by Wednesday and we had no option but to
withdraw (as a result of the extreme strains on the pound),' he said.
ERM realignment: Mr Lamont wanted to make 'absolutely clear' that the
government had received no request from the German authorities in the
weekend before Black Wednesday for the pound to realign, along with the
lira. During the week in which the pound left the ERM, the possibility of a
unilateral devaluation of sterling, while staying within the ERM, had not
been under discussion. The chancellor said he had seen what happened to
Italy, which devalued only to see the lira under further intense pressure,
eventually requiring it to leave the system. Benefits from ERM membership:
The government had succeeded in bringing down inflation from nearly 11 per
cent to less than 4 per cent, measured by the year-on-year increase in the
retail prices index. The difference between UK and German interest rates had
narrowed substantially since October 1990, when the UK joined the ERM.
Future membership of the ERM: Britain would re-enter 'in due course' when
various conditions were met, including monetary conditions in the UK and
Germany being closer to alignment. It was 'quite impractical' to talk of a
return until those conditions were met. It would be possible for Britain to
ratify the Maastricht treaty without having agreed to re-enter the ERM.
Exchange rate: Outside the ERM, Mr Lamont attached 'a lot of importance to
the exchange rate', but ruled out any explicit target for the pound against
other main currencies. He would take the exchange rate into account when
framing monetary policy. 'The exchange rate is a very important part of
policy; we can't let the exchange rate go,' he said.
Inflation: The inflation target announced by Mr Lamont last week set
'demanding' challenges for Britain. Inflation had to be kept at between 1
per cent and 4 per cent, measured by the year-on-year rate in the retail
prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments. The Treasury would
attempt to monitor inflationary conditions by studying a range of monetary
indicators. Future inflation performance: Inflation must come down further.
'The current rate is still not nearly good enough for this country,' Mr
Lamont said, bearing in mind the better inflation performance of many of the
UK's competitors. 'I have brought down inflation (under ERM membership) and
I don't want to see it moved up again.'
Effects of intervention to support sterling: Mr Lamont acknowledged that the
large purchases of sterling by the Bank of England on Black Wednesday -
which some estimates put at up to Pounds 15bn - had a contractionary effect
on the economy by reducing the amount of money in the banking system. Some
aspects of that, however, were counter-acted by Bank money market
operations. He refused to put a figure on the intervention as the sum was
'market-sensitive'.
Monetary policy since Black Wednesday: Base rates had come down by 1
percentage point to 9 per cent, while there had been an effective
devaluation of roughly 10 per cent as measured by sterling's trade-weighted
index. The combination of those developments added up to a significant
loosening of monetary policy. Britain would not, however, have a 'growth
target'. The government's main economic efforts would be concentrated on
bringing down inflation.
Interest rates: Mr Lamont gave no firm comment about the direction of
interest rates, but in response to questioning from MPs about the continuing
recession said he would not 'kickstart the economy by giving it an
artificial stimulus'. Public spending: It would not be right to increase
public spending because 'such increases cannot be afforded'. However, the
Treasury would attempt to exclude capital spending projects as far as
possible from the effects of any cuts.
ERM fault lines: Those had arisen in recent months largely because of the
'unique' circumstances of German re-unification, which had pushed up German
credit rates, and the lack of symmetry between the economies of Germany and
the US. That had led to a strong D-Mark at the expense of the dollar,
straining a number of ERM currencies, among them sterling. It was 'not
inevitable', however, that fixed exchange-rate systems broke down. The ERM
had performed a useful function for more than a decade in helping currency
stability and adding to disinflationary pressures. However, there were
technical aspects of ERM membership that could be usefully addressed, such
as the rules related to when central banks should intervene to support
currencies.
Mr Lamont's future: Mr Lamont said it was 'complete nonsense' that he should
stand down as chancellor. He had presided over a 'remarkable' reduction in
inflation which was 'not an inconsiderable achievement'.
Forecasting: It was fallacious to say whether the Treasury model of how the
economy worked was good or bad; everything in forecasts depended on what
numbers and judgments were fed to the models. 'I repeat what I have always
said, which is that all forecasts should be treated with caution and
scepticism,' he said. As for the future, Mr Lamont said 'no one would like
to see an (economic) recovery more than me'. But there was a limit as to
what governments could do to promote one.

'THERE have been more near-misses on this than Bosnian ceasefires,' a senior
US diplomat observed recently. He wondered how it was that while the EC and
US share an interest in concluding Gatt's Uruguay Round world trade talks
and are seemingly near in their positions, they are still separated by what
each sees as vital national interests.
On subsidies to farmers, an issue that has held up agreement since the
Uruguay Round summit collapsed in Brussels in December 1990, the US, EC and
other leading agri-exporters are trying to position themselves in export
markets, especially cereals.
France threatened to pull out of next Friday's EC summit in Birmingham if
the latest EC-US talks in Brussels gave away to the US too much of its food
exporting 'vocation'.
As the EC's agricultural superpower, France has concentrated its attack on a
Gatt provision to cut subsidised food exports 24 per cent on all products.
This would be a blow to its wheat trade, the most sensitive commodity for
the US alongside soya beans, on which it is conducting a parallel row with
the EC. The need to cut subsidised exports, contained in the Round's 'final
act' which Gatt drew up last December, is separate to, and on top of, a 36
per cent cut in money paid out on export subsidies.
At July's Group of Seven Munich summit, the UK proposed export volume be cut
by 21, not 24 per cent.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, has pushed for 'aggregation'
or flexibility in farm sectors. This way the EC could export more wheat, for
instance, if it sold less barley abroad, provided overall cuts in grain
exports reached the target.
The full 24 per cent cut, if it contains this flexibility, is a much better
deal for the EC than a far lower cut without it.
The US knows this, and that the reform of the EC's Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP), agreed in May, will cut European wheat prices to near world
market levels.
The real difference between the two sides on export volume is about
competition, and French wheat is very competitive.
If May's CAP reform had cut guaranteed prices a bit further, export
subsidies would have been scrapped well within the life of any Uruguay Round
agreement, and the US would have been hard pressed to seek restraints on EC
exporters. France would have been the main beneficiary from a slightly
bigger cut.
The second big difference to be resolved is for how long EC compensation
payments to farmers for the CAP reform price cuts will be exempt from
reductions prescribed by Gatt. Mr MacSharry wants indefinite exemption,
because the payments are compensation for price cuts and production cuts.
The US, if the cuts in output are formalised, is ready to exempt the
payments for only six years.
It is still possible Mr MacSharry might relent if the point is established
that if these payments do cut output and reduce trade tensions, they should
be exempt in the next round of cuts.

FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US and EC fail to break Gatt deadlock -
Intensive lobbying from French and American farm organisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and EC negotiations to break a 20-month deadlock in the Uruguay Round of
trade reform talks stalled last night in Brussels amid intensive lobbying by
French and US farm organisations.
Both sides claimed in a joint statement that 'it was good progress' and 'we
narrowed the gap', particularly on the most contentious issue of subsidised
farm trade.
Meetings on technical details continued last night but the main negotiators
on both sides have suspended talks for the time being. Mrs Carla Hills, US
trade representative, and Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs
commissioner, are to meet at the weekend in Toronto in the margins of the
'Quad' summit of ministers from the US, EC, Canada and Japan.
Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC farm commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, the US
agriculture secretary, also plan to meet as soon as the technical work by
officials on various scenarios for cutting back the value and volume of
subsidised farm exports is completed.
The failure to achieve a breakthrough at Brussels comes as a disappointment
after expectations had been raised over the past week. Because of the
impending US presidential election the talks had been seen as the last
chance this year to reach a settlement in the Gatt Round.
French farmers stand to lose most in the EC if the Community accepts US
demands for substantial cuts in subsidised exports volumes. Mr Jacques
Delors, European Commission president, has warned of the danger of a
political backlash in France; last week he said Paris might boycott meetings
of the Council of Ministers.
Mr Daniel Bernard, spokesman for the Quai d'Orsay, said yesterday there was
no connection between the Gatt talks and the Birmingham summit called to
discuss ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Suggestions that French
opposition to a Gatt deal would provoke a Birmingham boycott by President
Francois Mitterrand were 'speculation'.
But EC officials insisted Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French farm minister, had
suggested Mr Mitterrand would refuse to attend this week's Birmingham summit
if pressed to endorse concessions in the Round unacceptable to France.
Failure to narrow further the gap on the farm dispute can only be seen as a
short-term victory for French lobbying and intense pressure from the main US
farm organisations in the last two days.
A spokesman for Mr Madigan confirmed that there had been lobbying. 'We
always stay in touch with farm groups and these talks have been no
exception,' he said.
However, delay in reaching a settlement is not thought to have been
principally due to the prospect of a crisis at Birmingham this Friday.
Instead it is understood American negotiators had called for more time
mainly to analyse details of EC proposals.
The delay is nevertheless helpful in that it removes a potentially dangerous
area of dispute for the Birmingham summit.
US officials also commented that EC negotiators appeared to have
over-estimated their scope for compromise. They insist that more votes could
be lost by President George Bush in the presidential election as a result of
concessions that hurt farming interests than might be gained by a trade
liberalising agreement.

<TEXT>
THE decision of US and EC negotiators to embrace disputes over trade in
services and on market access in their meetings over the past two days in
Brussels may have demonstrated earnestness of intent, but clearly added to
the problems of breaking the Uruguay Round deadlock.
Little progress has been made in settling disputes on services and market
access, largely because Geneva-based negotiators have been unwilling to
budge until the US and the EC reveal their hands on farm trade. For many
developing countries, concessions from the US and the EC on farm trade are
essential before they table any offers.
A vicious circle has developed as the US has in turn refused to table its
own position without offers from the EC and developing countries.
A storm blew up when the US threatened to withdraw telecommunications,
financial services and transport, especially maritime services, from any
offer it might make on services trade.
Since these were for many countries the only services areas of interest in
the US market, the motive for continuing serious talks evaporated.
For the EC, a critical US concession on services would be willingness to
re-table telecommunications, financial services and maritime services. It is
understood that fresh openings on financial services have been discussed,
but headway on maritime services has been seen as unlikely.
Telecommunications concessions are unlikely until the EC can agree terms for
liberalising its internal market. On market access, the EC is urging the US
to attack its peak tariffs.
The US wants the EC to agree to scrap some that are already low, but
progress is hampered by awareness that mutual concessions need to be matched
by other countries.

FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Airbus scales back output growth rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBUS Industrie is scaling back its output growth rates for the next three
years in response to the continued depressed state of the civil airline
market. The consortium is expected to delay the launch of a new 125-seater
airliner, the A319, a shortened derivative of the 150 seater A320 aircraft,
until later next year.
Airbus output will grow from 161 airliners this year to 180 aircraft in 1995
against an earlier target of 220 for 1995. Production will average 14.5
airliners a month next year, up from about 16 a month in 1994, with a
further increase expected in 1995, but lower than the original plan to build
21-22 aircraft a month then. An Airbus official stressed the latest revision
was not a production cut, but a reduction in estimated output growth rate.
The latest cuts are the third downward revision in A320 production
schedules.
Airbus has sought to play down production cuts in an effort not to undermine
market confidence. It constantly monitors the market and adapts its
production schedules accordingly. Like other manufacturers, Airbus has been
forced to modify its schedules to meet demands from financially-pressed
customers to postpone some deliveries.
Boeing has cut output of its 737 twin-engine aircraft from 21 to 14 a month
this autumn and has announced plans to reduce 757 production from seven to
8.5 airliners a month from September 1993. The latest cuts in Airbus
production rates were announced on the eve of the roll-out of the
consortium's latest widebody, the A330 twin-engine airliner, in Toulouse
tomorrow, expected to be a low-key event, reflecting the general state of
the airliner market.
Airbus, whose partners include Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent),
Deutsche Aerospace of Germany (37.9 per cent), British Aerospace (20 per
cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent), said the latest plans envisaged a
minimum production of A300/A310 widebodies of 30 a year during 1993-95.
A300/A310 output this year is expected to total 47 aircraft.
Output of A320/A321 narrowbody airliners will average 80-90 a year during
1993-95. Production of the new A330/A340 family is expected to increase
gradually from the present two airliners a month to seven a month by the end
of 1995. Airbus had planned to launch the A319, the shortened version of the
A320 this year, But the programme is unlikely to take shape until next year.

SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA) is considering transferring accountancy and
computer departments to India to cut labour costs. The move would echo
Swissair's shifting its accounts department to Bombay this year; SIA and
Swissair have 5 per cent stakes in each other as part of a triple alliance
with the US carrier Delta.
SIA is studying Swissair's experience and said yesterday problems such as
software compatibility had to be overcome. Other low-cost countries
including China were possible sites, especially for data processing, SIA
said.
The airline is also facing rising staff costs because of Singapore's labour
shortage. Mr J Y Pillay, chairman, said yesterday he did not expect
resistance from the company's staff.
The shortages are also forcing SIA to consider recruiting cabin crew from
countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. 'We plan 8-10 per cent annual
growth a year until the end of the century,' Mr Cheong Choong Kong, managing
director, said. This would entail doubling the fleet and cabin staff.
SIA is considering raising the salaries of female cabin crew. New female
cabin crew recruits earn about SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 737) a month. SIA has
set up a pilot training school, but is still several years away from having
all its co-pilots as Singapore citizens.

<TEXT>
COUNTRIES of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei) have expressed
their concern about a recent move by Austria imposing mandatory labelling on
all tropical timber imports.
Mr Sanusi Junid, Malaysia's agriculture minister, said the Austrian action
went against the spirit and content of an agreement reached at the Earth
Summit in Rio on the management, conservation and sustainable development of
all types of forests.
Asean took a serious view of the Austrian action, he added. It had agreed to
adopt a common stand on the issue, to dissuade other countries from making
similar moves against tropical timber products. 'We are of the opinion that
if such action is to be imposed, it should also involve temperate timber.'
Malaysia, the world's leading exporter of tropical timber, has been at the
forefront of a campaign aimed at countering concern about continued logging
in the tropical rain forests.
It says much of the developed world's criticism about forestry management in
Malaysia and other countries is ill informed.

WHEN and if the US and EC reach accord, at least two months' work will be
required by negotiators in Geneva before the 108-nation Uruguay Round can be
completed. Other outstanding issues include:
Agriculture: Japan and South Korea want to maintain their rice import bans.
They, and some other countries with supply management systems, oppose draft
proposals for minimum market access and conversion of all import
restrictions to tariffs.
Market access: An EC/US deal would set the framework for other
country-by-country talks. But any accord on zero-tariff sectors would have
to be agreed with others and there would have to be bilateral talks on
products not covered by the US/EC bargain.
Poor nations want better access for textiles and tropical products in
rich-country markets.
Intellectual property: Even if the copyright wrangle between the US and EC
is settled in Brussels, Washington will still be pushing for changes to the
draft intellectual property agreement to give greater protection for
pharmaceutical patents in developing countries.
Services: The US and EC are not satisfied with offers from many developing
countries to liberalise their services sectors, especially in financial
services. The US wants better offers on basic telecommunications from almost
all trading partners. Maritime nations want the US to include shipping in a
services accord.
Multilateral Trade Organisation: Negotiators are under pressure from
environmental groups to make the MTO 'greener' and are still wrangling over
details of this proposed umbrella body for Gatt and the new agreements on
services and intellectual property.
Dispute settlement: Many developing countries want a formal commitment from
the US not to use its powers of unilateral retaliation in return for a
strengthened multilateral disputes procedure.

FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US comes top in services output -
Advantage greatest in airlines, banking and telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE productivity of many large service industries is still higher in the US
than in other leading industrialised countries, a study* by McKinsey Global
Institute, part of the management consultancy group, shows.
The study finds the US advantage is greatest in airlines, retail banking and
telecommunications, where productivity is as much as twice the levels in
other countries.
The study estimates that, despite official claims that liberalisation has
made Britain's telecommunications industry more efficient, its total
productivity was only 54 per cent of US levels in 1989 and also trailed
Japan and France.
However, Germany is close to US productivity levels in retailing, while in
full service restaurants France was the world leader. Productivity in
fast-food restaurants varied little between countries.
The study, based on a year-long research project, concludes that many of the
most important variations in productivity are due to differences in national
regulatory systems and labour market policies.
In general, productivity was highest in those countries where policy
encouraged competition and labour market flexibility. Fewer gains were to be
achieved by applying advanced technology than by introducing efficient
organisation and management.
The study compares recent international productivity records in five service
industries. These are:
Airlines: On a weighted average of six different measures, including ground
handling as well as in-flight service, European productivity was only 72 per
cent of US levels. The gap was smallest in airport handling and widest in
ticketing, sales and promotion.
Though part of the US airlines' advantage reflected superior scale,
geographic route structures and the mix of services demanded by the market,
the biggest reason for their higher performance was efficient organisation
of labour.
However, the study found that the 'hub-and-spoke' route structure favoured
by large US airlines since the industry was deregulated reduced their
productivity.
Retail banking: Overall productivity in Britain and Germany was only
two-thirds the level in the US. In Britain, the difference was blamed mainly
on weak competition, and in Germany on the commercial banks' extensive
networks of small branches.
The study found that US banks offered customer service in their branches
comparable to the two other countries and had invested more heavily in
information systems and automated teller machines.
Restaurants: Though the US ranked highest in terms of throughput per
employee, France scored best in terms of value added per employee. The study
found no clear explanation for these differences.
Retailing: Overall US productivity was narrowly ahead of Germany and almost
twice the level in Japan. Performance reflected the degree of concentration
of the industry in each country, income levels and industry structure and
organisation. However, property costs and scale economies were relatively
unimportant.
Telecommunications: The US advantage was largely due to superior capital
productivity. US telephone networks handled four times more calls per dollar
of investment than those in France and Germany, and twice as many as those
in Britain.
France, Germany and Japan achieved labour productivity close to US levels,
though Britain's performance was only 58 per cent of the US. The study
suggests British Telecom is heavily over-staffed.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Deputies in election limelight: US vice-presidential
candidates enter debate intent on avoiding gaffes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE US vice-presidential candidates will take to the stage in Atlanta
tonight set on besting each other in political debate and, above all,
avoiding any disastrous gaffes, writes George Graham in Washington.
It is safe to predict the most surprising candidate will be Mr James
Stockdale, the retired admiral running alongside Texas independent Mr Ross
Perot, because voters know almost nothing about him.
But the stakes are higher for Vice-President Dan Quayle and Senator Al Gore,
the Republican and Democratic candidates. Both men know their ability to
help their respective running mates - President George Bush and Governor
Bill Clinton - is less than their ability to hurt them.
Tonight's debate is particularly important for Mr Quayle, who has not yet
managed to live down the unfavourable impression he made in his first
national campaign in 1988.
Mr Quayle says he has gained experience during his four years as
vice-president, but complains he is unfairly treated by reporters. 'It's the
inability for us to get any kind of fair shake from the media that's been
the most frustrating thing about this campaign,' he told the New York Times.
Ironically, the vice-president stands to benefit from tonight's debate, as
few viewers will expect a stellar performance. With a modicum of good luck
Mr Quayle should be able to erase the memory of Senator Lloyd Bentsen's
put-down in the 1988 vice-presidential debate after he injudiciously
compared himself to President John Kennedy.
Yet Mr Quayle can be certain that any minor misstatement will be pounced on
as further evidence of an inability to remove his foot from his mouth.
On the Democratic side, Mr Gore has so impressed most spectators with his
intelligence, his command of detail and his unflappability that he will be
hard pressed to match expectation.
But, like Mr Clinton in Sunday's debate, Mr Gore need do no more than hold
his own.
For Mr Stockdale the debate offers a baptism of fire in policy questions -
ranging from health insurance to the spotted owl. An academic at the Hoover
Institution, a conservative think-tank in California, he holds the
distinction of being possibly the first man in the last half century to have
introduced the Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus into American political
discourse.
His principal topic of public conversation, besides the Stoics, has so far
been his experience as the most senior US prisoner of war in Vietnam.
Few analysts expect Mr Stockdale to match his running mate's brand of humour
and colourful phrasing, but he may do better on the details of the Perot
platform. He says he has read the 117-page policy document, entitled 'United
We Stand,' 10 times; this is widely believed to be 10 times more than Mr
Perot himself.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) said yesterday it had reduced the use
of two chemicals used to make semiconductors which are suspected of causing
miscarriages among women workers, Reuter reports from Armonk, New York.
The company said the use of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and ethylene
glycol monethyl ether acetate was cut by 40 per cent between 1989 and 1991.
The two have not been incorporated into any newly developed chipmaking
processes, an IBM spokesman said.
According to a study by Johns Hopkins University that IBM commissioned, 10
of 30 women who worked with the chemicals at two IBM plants and then became
pregnant had miscarriages.
IBM has told its own workers, all other semiconductor makers in the US, and
its suppliers about the study.
Mr Jim Ruderman, a spokesman for the company, emphasised that the study's
results were preliminary.
He said that the results to date did not establish a 'direct link' between
use of the chemicals and the miscarriages but showed a 'preliminary link'.
He added the number of miscarriages was small but statistically significant.
Mr Ruderman said IBM was 'continuously finding advances' in semiconductor
manufacturing processes, and 'the environment that may have caused the
miscarriages may or may not exist anymore'.

WESTERN creditor governments are scheduled to meet in Paris in the middle of
next week to discuss a possible rescheduling of the former Soviet Union's
Dollars 70bn (Pounds 39.3bn) foreign debt, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
A deferral of principal payments on medium-term debts has been extended
until the end of this month in anticipation of a full rescheduling. But
Paris Club creditors are at loggerheads with each other and their commercial
banks over how generous it should be.
Another problem is that Russia - which is the only republic to be making any
debt repayments and wants formal responsibility for the entire debt if other
republics give up claims on former Soviet assets - has so far failed to
reach agreement with Ukraine on a special arrangement for sharing repayments
with it.
Diplomats said this was less serious a problem, however, than disagreements
between countries such as the US, which has relatively little exposure, and
Germany, which is owed the lion's share.
Mr Peter Aven, Russian foreign economic relations minister, says Russia can
pay only Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn next year instead of the Dollars 20bn
falling due.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Caucasus crisis lures Moscow into old imperial role: If
Russia is involved in Abkhazia, it is giving clear signals of a wish to
control at least part of the region beyond its border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AIRPORT at Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, is thronged with soldiers wearing
the uniforms of at least four different bands - or no uniform in particular.
Further north, in Sukhumi, the capital of the war-torn autonomous region of
Abkhazia, soldiers supervising the loading of refugees into aircraft are as
hysterical as the fleeing women - fighting among themselves, screaming and
pushing at their charges and delaying the whole process with their
inefficiency.
In this former Soviet republic now descending into impoverished disorder,
being the only candidate helped Mr Eduard Shevardnadze achieve a sweeping
election victory at the weekend: indeed, no-one stood against him because
no-one thought they could - or wanted to - beat him.
The former Soviet foreign minister won three times more votes than needed to
become the leader of the Transcaucasian state. In an estimated 80 per cent
turnout, voters defied appeals for a boycott by supporters of the ousted
president Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia and gave Mr Shevardnadze more than 90 per
cent of the vote.
Mr Shevardnadze says his mandate now is to bring peace, prosperity and
democracy to his 5m-strong country.
His first task, however, is to wage more active war on the forces of the
Abkhazians and their allies, which have succeeded over the past three weeks
in pushing Georgian troops out of much of Abkhazia, save for the encircled
units in the capital of Sukhumi. The Abkhazian separatists, lead by Mr
Vladislav Ardzinba, wants to attach Abkhazia to Russia - citing a fear of
Georgian oppression.
In 1989, it was demonstrations for Abkhazian independence from Georgia and
for attachment to Russia (though Abkhazians make up less than 20 per cent of
the population of Abkhazia, the Georgians more than 40 per cent) which
sparked off demonstrations in Tbilisi for Georgian independence from Russia.
Now, the Abkhazians are supported by the Confederation of Caucasian Mountain
People - a mainly Moslem, pan-Caucasian organisation which is violently
against the Shevardnadze regime and yearns for a Caucasian state.
In Sukhumi, among the few Abkhazians left is a former minister of the
republic's government who has seen his fellow Abkhazians driven out of the
city after Georgian troops entered it at the beginning of last month and who
recounts tales of theft and beatings.
Indeed, during an interview in his flat, three Georgian soldiers burst in,
guns at the ready, having been alerted by neighbours of the presence of the
foreign press in the 'Abkhazians' house'. After an uncomfortable few minutes
an officer arrived and took the men away.
Out on the 'frontline' along the river Gumista a few miles from Sukhumi, the
two sides, only 200 yards apart, trade light arms fire from behind walls and
dugouts. Mr Khaindrava said at the weekend: 'We expect an attack at any
time, but we are ready.'
The most serious charge is the involvement of Russian soldiers. The
allegation is that Russian units, with civilian volunteers from the Russian
north Caucasian republics just over the Georgian/Russian border, form the
backbone of the Abkhazian forces - especially when they took the town of
Gagra earlier this month. The Russian units are alleged to be controlled by
General Georgi Kondratyev, the Russian deputy defence minister, and General
Pavel Sigutkin, commander of the big Russian air base at Gudauta, in
Abkhazia - where war material is unloaded and used on the Abkhazian side.
In the sophisticated version of this charge - used by Mr Shevardnadze and Mr
Khaindrava - Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is being led by the
nose by 'reactionary circles' in Russia. There is no proof of the
involvement, and it is denied by the Russian defence ministry: however, the
volunteers from the Caucasian states enter Abkhazia freely, and the
Abkhazians are well armed.
Russia was also accused by Ukraine last night of sending nine warships to
the area off Sukhumi. A Ukrainian navy spokesman said some 2,500 seamen were
aboard the ships, which included a large cruiser, two minesweepers and at
least one vessel for seaborne troops.
If the conflict is not stopped, it will consume Georgeia - inevitably
reviving the conflict in the South Ossetian region to the north, where peace
between the Georgians and Ossetians is kept by Russian soldiers. If the
Russians really are intervening - albeit without direct authority from the
president - they are giving clear signals that they wish to control at least
part of the Caucasus outside Russia.
Meanwhile, the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Armenian enclave
of Nagorno-Karabakh has recently escalated as more powerful Azerbaijan seeks
to reverse Armenian gains made in the spring.
Russia, though urged by Armenia (a member of the Commonwealth of Independent
States) to assist it, has sought to keep a balance: Mr Yeltsin yesterday
signed a treaty of co-operation and security with Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, the
Azeri president.
Mr Shevardnadze said yesterday he was ready to meet Mr Yeltsin in or near
Sukhumi today. However, a spokesman for Mr Yeltsin in Moscow said a delay in
the planned talks was necessary to work out 'new elements' in the process.
The three Caucasian states are not the only legacies of the Soviet imperium,
but they are the most complex and violent. As the CIS further weakens, and
as Russia defines its national interest more in classic terms of regional
power bargaining and pressure than in efforts to create a co-operative
commonwealth, so its meddling in these historically swirling waters must
increase.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Serbs pull out of talks with Croatia
</HEADLINE>

   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIA, under President Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday intensified its
confrontation with the Yugoslav federal government by trying to scupper
peace talks between the Yugoslav authorities and Croatia.
Serbia withdrew from talks in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on the
re-establishment of economic relations and transport, and the return of
Croatian refugees to United Nations protected zones in Serb-held areas of
Croatia.
A Serbian government statement accused the Yugoslav government, under Prime
Minister Milan Panic, of betraying Croatia's Serb minority by negotiating
with Croatia.
However, the federal government last night criticised the Serbian
administration, saying 'only negotiations, and not cannons, will bring back
dignity and freedom to the Serbs outside Serbia'.
In an apparent reference to Mr Milosevic, it said: 'The people who brought
us to a desperate position before the international community have no moral
right to undermine moves towards peace by the Yugoslav government and
president.'
The conflict between Mr Milosevic, on one side, and Mr Panic and Mr Dobrica
Cosic, the Yugoslav president, is set to sharpen further after last Sunday's
referendum failed to win a vote in favour of early elections. Unofficial
results yesterday showed the vote to be less than the required 50 per cent
majority.
Hopes for the demilitarisation of Sarajevo also foundered yesterday when
Bosnian leaders pulled out of UN-sponsored talks. They accused Bosnian Serbs
of stopping the repair of water and power in the Bosnian capital, which has
been besieged for six months by Serb fighters.
In northern Bosnia, Serb commanders said they had re-opened the land
corridor for traffic between Serbia and Bosnia's Serb-held territories amid
heavy fighting.
However, in a conflicting report, Croatian radio claimed Croat forces had
blocked the corridor west of Brcko, in north-eastern Bosnia.
Reuter adds from London: Three European officials investigating atrocities
against civilians in former Yugoslavia said Serbs seemed mainly to blame and
thought there were legal grounds for prosecution.
A draft report by officials appointed on British initiative under the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, recommended a committee
of experts should work out a treaty creating a war crimes tribunal.

THE French government yesterday announced plans to help the country's
hard-pressed small businesses with what amounts to an increase of FFr11bn
(Dollars 2.3bn) in soft loans.
The government plan represents an effort to stop the wave of small company
bankruptcies under the impact of high interest rates, without significantly
adding to the budget deficit. The two-part plan includes:
Increasing by FFr1bn to FFr26bn the annual threshold for soft loans raised
from low-interest deposits with the state savings banks and channelled to
industrial development.
Creating a loan guarantee fund of FFr300m to be operated by the
state-controlled organisation Sofaris, which up to now has only helped
underwrite risk capital invested in small businesses.

TWO of Germany's leading multinationals yesterday blamed falling demand and
prices in markets for electronics for the planned loss of almost 3,000 jobs.
Siemens, the electrical and electronics engineering giant, said it had been
forced to speed up rationalisation of its loss-making semiconductor
business. The division, which has already shed almost 2,000 jobs this year,
plans to reduce its international workforce by a further 2,300 to 11,000 by
the time restructuring is complete in 1995, Mr Jurgen Knorr, managing
director, said yesterday.
Timing of the cuts would depend on market developments, he said, painting a
gloomy picture of current prospects.
Meanwhile, BASF unveiled plans to close two audio and video cassette
factories by the end of next year and reduce its payroll by 570.
BASF Magnetics, a subsidiary of the BASF chemicals group, which lost DM234m
(Pounds 93.6m) last year on sales of DM2bn, said its tape factory in
Ettenheim, Germany, would close by the middle of next year and a works in
Gien, France, would be shut by the end of 1993.
The announcements add to a rapidly growing tally of job losses among leading
German manufacturers, which are now feeling the full effects of
international recession coupled with a rapid slowdown in the domestic
economy. Other recent cuts include the loss of 7,500 jobs at Deutsche
Aerospace, the aircraft and space division of Daimler-Benz. Earlier this
year the group said it was to reduce the payroll at its Mercedes-Benz
vehicles subsidiary by 20,000.
Mr Knorr said prices for semiconductors had fallen 20 per cent and sales to
important customers such as television, audio and engineering companies were
down 25 per cent.
Olivetti, the Italian conglomerate, is to close its Triumph-Adler factory in
Nuremberg at the cost of about 1,000 jobs.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Bundestag plans tighter control of EC issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S main political parties are expected to reach agreement this week
on an important constitutional amendment, giving the German parliament far
more power to influence legislation in the European Community.
The plan, drafted by constitutional experts from the Christian Democrats and
Free Democrats, from the government side, and from the opposition Social
Democrats, would set up a form of EC oversight committee, along the lines
already operated in Britain and Denmark.
The new deal is likely to make Germany a less flexible negotiating partner,
just as Denmark and Britain already are, because of their parliamentary
control systems. The German plan would require the government to submit all
proposed EC legislation to the committee, before it comes up for negotiation
in the Council of Ministers, and then to take account of the parliamentary
opinion in its subsequent negotiations.
It amounts to the first time that the German Bundestag - the directly
elected lower house of parliament - has insisted on real powers to oversee
and influence law-making in Brussels. Until now, the EC committee of the
Bundestag has been little more than a rubber stamp for the negotiations of
the German government.
Bonn has virtually agreed to similar powers for the 16 federal states in the
Bundesrat, the upper house.
German parliamentarians defend the proposed enhancement of their powers as
an essential element of greater democratic control over Brussels - a demand
sparked off by the current debate over the Maastricht treaty on European
union. The Bundestag is likely to make the constitutional amendment a
precondition for ratification of the treaty.
They also say that its aim is to make the EC more democratic, and more
integrated, rather than to resist the integration process. However, they
admit that it will depend very much on how such a powerful committee
operates.
The plan won the backing yesterday of the Christian Democratic Union and
Christian Social Union Bundestag leadership, and is expected to be approved
by the full constitutional committee on Thursday.
A simple constitutional amendment will be complemented by an accompanying
law spelling out the details, requiring the German government to provide
comprehensive information to the planned committee on every item of
legislation, including an explanation of its purpose, of the government
negotiating plans, and of the positions of other member states.

<TEXT>
ITALY'S industry minister yesterday promised to be as open as possible with
the European Commission about plans for a far-reaching privatisation of the
country's public holding companies, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
Prof Giuseppe Guarino told Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner,
that Rome wanted to co-operate during the three- or four-year process which
will end with the sale of shares in the public-sector groups. The detailed
privatisation programme will be published early next month.
EC competition authorities will be on the look-out for disguised state aid -
in the form of debt write-offs, for example - during the penultimate phase
of the project, when the government is preparing the companies for sale.
Brussels will also look askance at any attempt to impose discriminatory
terms on the flotation.
Italian diplomats said yesterday that Sir Leon ought to welcome the
increased openness and competition which privatisation would bring to the
Italian state sector. Sir Leon is already looking at some sensitive state
aid cases involving large Italian companies such as Ilva, the state-owned
steel-maker, and car-maker Fiat.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Brussels warned on mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission ought to be more flexible in deciding whether merger
inquiries are handled in Brussels or by national anti-trust authorities,
according to Sir Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the British Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Speaking to lawyers at a symposium on EC merger control, Sir Sydney
suggested the clause in the EC merger rules which allows member states to
ask for jurisdiction over certain cases had led to some anomalies and might
have to be rewritten. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, has
repeatedly stressed that the two-year-old merger regulation is intended to
provide a 'one-stop shop' for cross-border merger inquiries, sparing
companies the need to go to two or three national authorities for approval.
But Sir Sydney said yesterday: 'One should not be totally mesmerised by the
one-stop shop. I think it's very useful, but what is more important is to
get the right result for European and domestic competition.' Only one deal -
involving Tarmac and Steetley, the British building products groups - has
been referred back to a national authority under the clause, which was
included in the rules at Germany's request.
The German authorities have twice asked to examine mergers, on the grounds
that they affected competition on a 'distinct (national) market', but been
refused. Dr Kurt Stockmann of the German Cartel Office said yesterday that
the German authorities were 'not entirely satisfied'.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK discounts fresh treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor, and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the British Foreign Secretary, yesterday discounted reports
that France and Germany supported the drafting of an alternative treaty for
European union in case Denmark and Britain did not ratify the Maastricht
treaty.
He was referring to reports that the European Commission had begun work on
the draft, following a secret agreement between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France to pursue European
integration with the Benelux countries if the Maastricht treaty proved to be
a dead letter.
Mr Hurd told members of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that,
if the treaty was not ratified, there was clearly a danger that some EC
states would decide, 'after a time', that the benefits of working together
were such that there should be a new framework.
'However, it is clear to me that the federal chancellor (Mr Kohl) and the
French president (Mr Mitterrand) are not interested in that approach. But
whether there are people chattering on these lines in the background, I
cannot possibly say,' he said.
After the recent Anglo-German dispute over Britain's withdrawal from the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), Mr John Major, the British Prime
Minister, and Chancellor Kohl will attempt to mend their fences at a working
dinner in Birmingham on Thursday, on the eve of the Community's one-day
emergency summit.
How to put flesh and bones on the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the
Maastricht treaty - that the centralised EC institutions should only deal
with matters which cannot be decided more effectively at national level -
will also be high on the agenda.
Both Downing Street and Mr Hurd poured cold water on any expectations the
summit would produce substantial results. It was the hope of the British EC
presidency that the meeting would decide on clear instructions to the
Community's council of ministers on how to define subsidiarity. The council
would present its definitive conclusions to the full EC summit in Edinburgh
in December.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Five-year pay pact offered by I G Metall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leader of Germany's largest and most powerful trade union has offered
the government five years of pay peace during which he would expect pay
rises to do no more than preserve the purchasing power of his 3.5m members.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, who will today be re-elected as leader of the I G
Metall engineering union, made the offer as the union's opening shot in the
renewed debate about a 'solidarity pact' to place the financing of German
unification on a sounder footing.
The offer, made in an interview with the Financial Times, follows a
suggestion from Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the German president, that unions
should not seek increases in real wages for several years.
'We would be happy to make a pact in which, over the next five years, real
wages would be protected. That would be a good basis for a solidarity pact,'
said Mr Steinkuhler in Hamburg, where the I G Metall Congress opened on
Sunday.
The offer represents a small but significant concession by the union - which
usually demands a cost of living increase plus a share in productivity
improvements - and underlines that it is ready to contribute to a solidarity
pact.
However few of the unions' other ideas for such a pact are likely to find
favour with the government. I G Metall, like the opposition Social
Democrats, favours another round of tax increases to help finance
unification but Mr Steinkuhler insists 'they must be more fairly distributed
and cover a more realistic time period'.
The union proposes a 'labour market' tax which would fall not just on
employees but also on the self-employed and public officials. It wants a
profits levy on companies not investing in east Germany.
I G Metall itself is under growing pressure to relax an agreement, signed
with the engineering employers in 1991, for a convergence of east German
hourly wage rates to the west German level by 1994. German employers say
unit labour costs in most of east German manufacturing plants are almost
double west German levels, deterring badly needed investment.
Mr Steinkuhler says the convergence agreement is not negotiable.
The debate heated up yesterday, when Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics
minister, said he would introduce a law to allow renegotiation, if the
unions and employers failed to agree such a move themselves.
'The Chancellor (Helmut Kohl) proposes a solidarity pact, and then Mollemann
sabotages it,' an angry Mr Steinkuhler declared.

TWO of Germany's leading multinationals yesterday blamed falling demand and

Siemens, the electrical and electronics engineering giant, said it had been
forced to speed up rationalisation of its loss-making semiconductor

The division, which has already shed almost 2,000 jobs this year, plans to
reduce its international workforce by a further 2,300 to 11,000 by the time
restructuring is complete in 1995, Mr Jurgen Knorr, managing director, said
yesterday.
Timing of the cuts would depend on market developments, he said, painting a
gloomy picture of current prospects.
Meanwhile, BASF unveiled plans to close two audio and video cassette
factories by the end of next year and reduce its payroll by 570.
The announcements add to a rapidly growing tally of job losses among leading
German manufacturers, which are now feeling the full effects of
international recession coupled with a rapid slowdown in the domestic
economy.
Other recent cuts include the loss of 7,500 jobs at Deutsche Aerospace, the
aircraft and space division of Daimler-Benz. Earlier this year the group
said it was to reduce the payroll at its Mercedes-Benz vehicles subsidiary
by 20,000.
Mr Knorr said prices for semiconductors had fallen 20 per cent and sales to
important customers such as television, audio and engineering companies were
down 25 per cent.
While the division had managed to maintain total turnover at around last
year's DM2bn (Pounds 800m) by stepping up volume sales by 10 per cent, there
had been no significant impact on losses. The Siemens semiconductor business
lost DM500m last year.
However, Mr Knorr claimed, markets were expected to improve next year thanks
to increased demand from mobile telephone manufacturers, the conventional
telecommunications industry, and the motor industry.
BASF Magnetics, a subsidiary of the BASF chemicals group, which lost DM234m
last year on sales of DM2bn, said its tape factory in Ettenheim, Germany,
would close by the middle of next year and a works in Gien, France, would be
shut by the end of 1993.
The company, which first announced plans to close the Ettenheim works last
year, and then shelved them following protests from the workforce, does not
expect to return to profit until 1994.
Eastern Germany imported DM5.18bn from western Germany in July, up 25 per
cent from a year ago, the Federal Statistics Office reported yesterday,
AP-DJ reports from Wiesbaden.
Goods flowing to western Germany from eastern Germany in July amounted to
DM736m, 12 per cent less than in July 1991, the agency added.
In the first seven months of July, eastern Germany imported DM34.17bn from
the 11 western states, 42 per cent more than the same period a year earlier.
Exports to western Germany rose 10 per cent to DM5.79bn.
Olivetti, the Italian conglomerate, is to close its Triumph-Adler computer
factory in Nuremberg at the cost of about 1,000 jobs.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Portugal's currency and the great escape: The escudo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF OLD prejudice ruled the currency markets, the Portuguese escudo should be
having a terrible time, along with its southern neighbours in the exchange
rate mechanism, the lira and the peseta. The Portuguese are, after all, much
poorer than Spaniards or Italians.
But no. While the lira has been catapulted from the system and the peseta
has devalued 11 per cent since July, the tiny escudo has ridden out the
European Monetary System's currency storm well within its 6 per cent ERM
fluctuation band after hardening just one minor capital control.
The Bank of Portugal now holds bigger foreign currency reserves than France.
Speakers at a banking conference in Oporto yesterday estimated current
holdings at at least Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14bn), the equivalent of about one
year's imports.
Happy government officials in Lisbon, from Prime MinAnibal Cavaco Silva
down, insist this is simply market recognition of the sound state of
Portugal's 'fundamentals' - almost full employment, falling inflation (9 per
cent from 11.4 per cent in 1991), declining interest rates and public debt,
and a current account surplus.
Sceptics suggest that the escudo - which only joined the ERM in April - has
escaped because speculators have not realised it is there to play with yet.
They say the peseta's slide against the escudo makes a devaluation, soon,
inevitable. Portugal does more than 20 per cent of its trade with Spain.
In Lisbon, though, the government is brimming with purpose and policies.
With the socialist opposition at war with itself, Mr Cavaco Silva's Social
Democrats are slimming down the civil service and facing down opposition
over introduction of university fees, military cuts and a new strike law.
Underpinning this is the prime minister's consistent use of exchange rates
to fight inflation. Appointed finance minister in 1979, after a string of
devaluations, he quickly revalued the escudo by 6 per cent and has
systematically boosted the currency since becoming prime minister in 1985.
'This is the first time since 1974,' says Mr Cavaco Silva, 'that a foreign
economic crisis has not been magnified in Portugal. We have done tough
things and every meeting of the Cabinet now is eliminating (public) services
that we don't want. For its part, industry is now well aware that it cannot
depend on the depreciation of the escudo to gain competitiveness.'
The government is about to tighten the screws with a rigorous 1993 budget,
which, the prime minister says, will be a 'negative increase' in monetary
terms. The budget aims to cut the public sector deficit from above 5 per
cent to less than 4 per cent of GDP, taking the country to within a whisker
of one of the main targets of EC economic and monetary union (Emu).
Spain's big and recent deficit problems have been a stark reminder to Lisbon
of how quickly things can go bad. Spain has a more virtuous economic past
than the Portuguese - opening its economy in the 60s, democratising smoothly
in the 70s and savagely attacking industrial fat in the early 80s. Portugal,
meanwhile, fought wars in Africa and overthrew its dictatorship in a
left-wing revolution, which much of the 80s was spent reversing.
Thus, Portugal is now steadying itself to deal with large-scale industrial
restructuring and an inevitable rise in unemployment. Even the prime
minister says jobs will go, and, in fact, that they probably should, if the
country is to become competitive. 'Our rate of unemployment (below 4 per
cent) is too low,' he says. 'We are prepared for higher unemployment if
necessary.'
That resolve is key to talks that begin soon between the government, unions
and employers on 1993 wage increases. These talks can fix public service pay
but set guidelines for the private sector. Lisbon will seek agreement around
6 per cent, with inflation targeted at between 5 per cent and 7 per cent.
Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist at Banco Comercial Portugues,
thinks this is optimistic. 'The country is going through a very pronounced
slowdown,' he says. The government has cut growth estimates for this year
from 3.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent and investment is falling sharply.
'I think that when the currency markets stabilise we are going to see a
dramatic devaluation,' says Mr Namorado Rosa. Mr Jose Alberto Tavares
Moreira, until recently governor of the central bank, agrees. 'The escudo is
perhaps too strong at the moment,' he says. 'It is not sustainable and will
inevitably be reflected in a deterioration of the external accounts.' But as
a 5 per cent devaluation would take the heat off labour intensive exporting
industry and could lift inflation to 10 per cent next year, Lisbon is not
keen to move before setting the private sector a tough wages target. Time,
though, is very tight, if agreement is to be reached before Portugal becomes
swept up in broad ERM realignment.
For the moment there may be safety in obscurity. 'The escudo's life in the
ERM has been so short that most market operators may not know it is there,'
says Mr Namorado Rosa. Even if they do, Portugal's Dollars 25bn currency
reserves may be worth more than all the tradeable escudos on the market even
though central bank intervention has drawn down non-gold reserves because of
recent turmoil in the foreign exchange markets.
And while the government's decision to halve the overdrafts that foreign
branches of Portuguese banks can hold with their parents damages the spirit
of Lisbon's decision in the summer to lift all capital controls next year,
it was a relatively serene decision. 'Portugal is run by economists,' notes
Mr Joao Oliveira Rendeiro, who runs Gestifundo, a Lisbon fund manager,
referring to the prime minister and his finance minister. Perhaps that makes
a difference.

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime
minister, met in Bonn yesterday to prepare their positions for Friday's EC
summit in Birmingham - and firmly rejected any suggestion of a 'two-speed'
European Community, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
As officials in Bonn denied any part in preparation of plans for an
inner-core fast track Community, the two heads of government insisted that
they were still determined to gain ratification of the Maastricht treaty on
European Union by all 12 member states - including Denmark and Britain.
Mr Kohl is involved in a hectic round of preparatory talks for the summit,
along with Mr Klaus Kinkel, who flew last night to Paris for a dinner with
Mr Roland Dumas, his French counterpart, and Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish
foreign minister.
Today Mr Kinkel will fly to Brussels for a working dinner with Mr Jacques
Delors, the president of the European Commission.
German officials are at pains to stress that all the official activity does
not amount to a specific German 'initiative', but is rather part of a
concerted effort by all member states to find common ground on a political
declaration from the Birmingham summit, designed to reassure all their
electorates about the Maastricht process.
One element in that process is the German plan for increased enforcement of
'subsidiarity' in EC decision-making, as well as ideas for greater
transparency in the whole EC process.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Brussels drafts plan to end EC power struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission wants a settlement between Brussels and European
Community member states to resolve the power struggle within the EC, clarify
the principle of subsidiarity and end the crisis over the Maastricht treaty.
A confidential draft of its proposed deal obtained by the Financial Times
shows that Brussels is aiming for a solution analogous to the division of
powers detailed in the 10th amendment to the US constitution, which reserves
for individual states power not vested in the federal government. The
Commission was expected to approve this draft last night or today.
The draft proposes three main principles which will be put forward to the EC
summit in Birmingham on Friday. They are meant to clarify the point that
power in the EC rests with the member states unless otherwise specified.
Although the Commission is the first EC body to outline a formal settlement,
the main political result of the document may therefore be to take the heat
off Brussels.
This solution would not require tampering with the Maastricht treaty, since
it would take the form of a separate 'Interinstitutional Agreement on the
Subsidiarity Principle' between the Commission, the European Parliament and
the Council of Ministers of the 12 member states.
On Friday, EC heads of government will try to hammer out a deal on
subsidiarity - the principle that the EC should act only when measures taken
nationally or locally are ineffectual - and try to resolve the crisis over
ratification of Maastricht.
The Commission is trying to seize the initiative and neutralise attempts by
the bigger member states to emasculate its powers. It is also putting
pressure on the Twelve to decide what it is they want the EC to do in
common.
Brussels also wants to:
Move from intrusive and bind-ing legislation towards framework laws which
states would agree but implement according to national circumstances.
Devolve much responsibility for implementing EC law to member states.
Decentralise management of 'a number of the Commission's more burdensome
activities' including agricultural markets and regional spending - which
together amount to four-fifths of the EC budget.
The first principle states that: 'The powers of the member states shall
constitute the rule; the Community's powers, whether exclusive or shared
with the member states, shall constitute the exception.'
The second says the subsidiarity clause in Maastricht concerns purely 'the
exercise and not the conferment of powers, which is reserved for the authors
of the treaty', namely the national governments.
The third pillar is that the EC should only act where there is demonstrable
need, and that the measures it takes should be proportional to the result
which is sought. The two tests should be the 'comparative efficiency' and
the 'value added' by acting on an EC-wide basis.
The Commission suggests a four-tier hierarchy for Community action: 'very
strong justification', 'strong justification', 'justification', and 'minimal
justification'.

FT  13 OCT 92 / Lamont rules out 'kickstart': Cutting inflation stays at
heart of economic policy, chancellor tells MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday underlined that UK economic
policy would continue to aim at cutting inflation and rejected any idea of
'kickstarting the economy' to produce faster growth.
In a dogged performance before the all-party Commons Treasury and Civil
Service committee, the chancellor said the government would pay very careful
attention to the sterling exchange rate in formulating monetary policy.
Stressing that the UK had no exchange rate target now that it had left the
European exchange rate mechanism, he nevertheless said he would 'attach
particular importance' to the pound's movements against the Bank of
England's trade weighted index of currencies.
He also said that Britain's inflation rate - currently 4 per cent on the
Treasury's measure of underlying inflation - would have to 'come down
further'. The UK had to compete with countries with lower inflation.
Mr Lamont's evidence, given in an occasionally barbed two-hour session, shed
no new light on how the government would use the various monetary and
financial indicators it has chosen as guides to monetary policy when setting
interest rates.
He did not say when sterling might return to the ERM, insisting only that it
would be 'quite impractical' to rejoin the mechanism before economic and
monetary conditions in the UK and Germany were more compatible.
In what could be a move to give the government leeway before re-entering the
ERM, he repeatedly said that the UK would be able to ratify the Maastricht
treaty on closer European union without first having sterling back in the
mechanism.
The emphasis the chancellor placed on curbing inflation and the need to
avoid a free fall in sterling persuaded some City commentators that he would
be in no rush to cut interest rates further.
Opinion on the domestic money market has been moving in the direction of a
cut in rates in recent days. Three months money, a key indicator of how the
market thinks base rates are moving, closed at around 8 per cent yesterday
compared with bank base rates at 9 per cent.
Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist of UBS Phillips and Drew, the City
securities house, said he thought the government would now 'keep markets
waiting' for interest rate cuts, but would act after periods of stability or
strength for sterling.
By avoiding any serious mistakes in his testimony, Mr Lamont appeared to
have reassured Tory MPs yesterday that he could give a robust justification
for his economic policies. But although he emerged from the
cross-examination by MPs with his standing at Westminster at least no worse
than before, speculation continued over how long he could remain at the
Treasury.
Conservative MPs appeared content with his apparent no-score draw. 'I don't
think that there was anything today that undermined his position and I would
have thought that he would probably have strengthened it,' Mr John Watts,
the committee's Tory chairman, said.
But Mr Lamont is vulnerable to attacks from Labour that there is a vacuum in
his economic policy. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said on Channel 4
News the chancellor's performance was 'appalling'. The chancellor had said
'not a word about growth, about bringing down unemployment and strengthening
industry'.
However, Mr Lamont told the committee that he did not believe in
'kickstarting the economy by artificial stimulus'.
He rejected higher public spending and although he said that the government
would do its best to safeguard capital spending, 'at the end of the day' it
was the overall control of public spending that mattered.
Questioned about the circumstances of Britain's departure from the ERM, Mr
Lamont denied the substance of reports that the UK's EC partners had
suggested a broader realignment of the ERM, including a devaluation of
sterling, during September 12-13 when the Italian lira was devalued.
However, the controversy looks set to continue after Mr Horst Kohler, the
state secretary in the Bonn finance ministry, said that Britain refused an
offer to realign sterling in the ERM before Black Wednesday.
Talking on BBC TV's Panorama last night, he said: 'Together with the
Bundesbank we came to the conclusion it would be the right decision to make
a broad realignment in the EMS, including the lira, the British pound, and
maybe other currencies, in order to ease tensions.
The British government took a different decision,' he added. 'They were not
prepared to contribute in a broad realignment.'
