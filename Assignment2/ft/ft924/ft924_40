FT  13 OCT 92 / M&amp;G shake-up signals more aggressive sales approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G, Britain's largest independent unit trust company, has replaced its
marketing director in a move that signals a shift towards a more aggressive
sales approach and a greater emphasis on products other than unit trusts.
Mr Tim Miller, who was also a main board member at M&amp;G, will leave the
company. He will be succeeded by Mr Peter Emms, formerly executive director
of marketing at Allied Dunbar, a life insurer which relies heavily on
commission-only agents and is known for an aggressive sales approach.
M&amp;G, which has always sold its products only through independent financial
advisers or by direct advertising, is now considering the establishment of a
small direct sales force, according to Mr Paddy Linaker, chief executive.
'We are not going to convert ourselves into an Allied Dunbar of hard-headed
salesmen,' Mr Linaker said, adding that to do so would risk tarnishing the
company's image. 'Commission-only sales agents do not fit into the M&amp;G
ethos.' However, M&amp;G was concerned that failure to build a direct sales
force could eventually cause it to lose market share.
It also plans to improve services to the independent broker network which
accounts for two-thirds of unit trust sales and almost all life and pensions
sales.
Mr Miller's removal coincides with M&amp;G's decision to concentrate on sales of
life insurance and pensions. These products have seen rising demand while
M&amp;G experienced a net outflow of unit trust business in the first half of
this year.
M&amp;G's sales approach has contrasted with that of Allied Dunbar and other
commission-only insurance companies. Eschewing a hard-sell approach, it has
preferred to capitalise on brand-name recognition.
The move is indicative of growing concern over the ability of independent
brokers to maintain their market share. Figures from the Unit Trust
Association showed that in the first half of 1992, clients of independent
advisers had sold Pounds 120m more of unit trusts than they had bought. By
contrast, direct sales forces achieved a net inflow of Pounds 190m.
Mr Linaker said the board wanted to combine responsibility for oversight of
the independent financial adviser network with marketing and sales, noting
that Mr Miller had not directly overseen the brokerage network.
Mr Miller, who joined M&amp;G in 1988, said he was 'baffled' at the move to
replace him.

FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes dissident rules out making
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Murray, the dissident shareholder at the centre of an
increasingly bitter battle for boardroom control of Andrews Sykes, yesterday
ruled out making a bid for the industrial services and environmental
products group in the current circumstances.
European Fire Protection Holding, Mr Murray's main investment vehicle
through which he now holds a 29.2 per cent stake in Andrews Sykes, said
yesterday that it considers the company to be 'substantially overvalued at
the current market price,' and added, 'in the absence of a material change
in circumstances - which would include an offer by a third party - EFP will
not make an offer for the company at this level.'
Mr Murray has criticised the recent financial performance of Andrews Sykes
and has set down resolutions calling for the removal of Mr David Hubbard,
the chairman, and Mr David Crowe, a non-executive director, from the
five-man board and their replacement by himself and three of his associates
at an extraordinary meeting on Friday.
Andrews Sykes' shares closed unchanged yesterday at 130p after gaining 5p on
Friday when European Fire increased its stake in Andrews Sykes from 26.6 per
cent to 29.2 per cent by buying shares in the market.
However yesterday's statement is clearly designed to dispel any
shareholders' hopes that the battle could develop into a full bid.
In a letter to shareholders on Friday, Mr Hubbard launched a fierce attack
on Mr Murray and his record as chairman of Nu-Swift, where he is the
majority shareholder, and urged them to vote against Mr Murray's
'unnecessary and unmerited' proposals.
European Fire countered yesterday that Mr Hubbard had failed to address its
'legitimate concerns' and was seeking to 'divert shareholders attention away
from the question of Andrews Sykes' survival and the absence of an effective
strategy to reverse its decline.'

BMW, the luxury car maker, has sealed the first international co-operation
agreement for recycling used cars with France's Renault, it said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Munich. BMW had signed the contract to work together on
disassembling procedures and industrial recycling of the used cars, it
added.
The two groups also agreed that Francaise des Ferrailles in Athis-mons would
process used BMW cars in France, while Guenter Schmitt in Wurzburg would
recycle used cars of both companies in Germany. Germany's environment
minister Klaus Topfer presented a draft regulation in August which would
make it compulsory for car makers to take back their old cars when the cars
are ready for the scrap heap.

bank
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, the Italian state-owned holding company which is privatising some
subsidiaries, has appointed Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, to advise
on the sale of Credito Italiano.
The surprise decision to sell Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth-biggest bank,
was announced by the government last month. But no indication was given as
to the timing or method of the deal. Analysts now expect the disposal of
part or all of IRI's 67 per cent stake to take place via a trade sale to a
group of outside buyers, probably around the year-end.
In spite of the government's enthusiasm for increasing popular share
ownership, the likelihood of a public placement of IRI's shares has
decreased owing to the current depressed value of the bank's equity. Credito
Italiano is now capitalised at around L2,000bn (Dollars 1.61bn), against an
actual value estimated by senior managers at between L7,000bn and L10,000bn.
The high price has also made a straight sale to a single buyer less
probable. A transfer of ownership to a foreign financial institution may not
receive the Bank of Italy's blessing, while the number of banks which could
afford to buy Credito Italiano is already limited.
Hence analysts expect at least part of IRI's shares to be bought by a 'hard
core' of private-sector Italian investors. Familiarity with the bank and the
domestic financial scene could persuade such buyers to pay a substantial
premium over current bourse levels. Another part of IRI's stake might be
floated simultaneously, or subsequently.
IRI said it would be up to Merrill Lynch to recommend the best procedure for
the sale to maximise the proceeds, while 'respecting the market and the
interests of Credito Italiano'. A mandate for valuing the bank, to take
place after Merrill Lynch makes its recommendations, may be awarded to
another institution.

move

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kuwait Investment Office's attempt to extricate itself from its large
and haemorrhaging property interests in Spain has met with a blanket refusal
from creditor banks to accept a debt-for-equity swap.
This development has brought Prima Inmobiliaria, a KIO-controlled property
company, close to bankruptcy in what would be the second crash of a KIO
Spanish asset in less than three months. In July Ercros, KIO's big Spanish
chemicals group, went into receivership owing more than Pta200bn (Dollars
2bn).
The KIO faces an additional problem with Prima, which has debts of Pta57bn.
At issue is the extent of KIO's holding in the property company and this
dispute brings to the forefront a row between the present and former
managers of KIO and its Spanish investment arm, Grupo Torras.
Grupo Torras acknowledges that a 32.45 per cent holding in Prima is
contested by the banks which claim its actual equity could be in excess of
60 per cent. This higher figure takes into account the stakes in Prima of
the two men who masterminded the growth of Grupo Torras - Mr Fouad Jaffar,
KIO general manager until 1990 and Spanish financier Mr Javier de la Rosa,
who severed his connections with KIO earlier this year.
Grupo Torras says it is not responsible for such shareholdings while the
banks claim they were all brought together at the time the loans were made
to Prima.
Grupo Torras' new management is investigating the business dealings of Mr
Fouad, Mr de la Rosa and their associates in the KIO's investment drive into
Spain.
The Italian financier Mr Carlo Bonomi, chairman of the Saffa paper group
which owns 5.77 per cent of Prima, resigned from Prima's board last week
alleging that Grupo Torras's shareholding in the property company was
greater than had been publicly stated.

FT  12 OCT 92 / International Company News: Minebea forecasts first loss due
to NMB burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINEBEA, a leading Japanese machinery maker, has forecast consolidated
pre-tax losses of Y7bn (Dollars 57.4m) for the year to September - the first
loss for the world's foremost maker of miniature bearings since its founding
in 1951.
The company blamed the turnround - from taxable profits of Y7bn the year
before - on losses at its semiconductor subsidiary, NMB Semiconductor, and
on the fall in the Tokyo stock market, which is likely to result in paper
losses of about Y2.8bn.
Like many Japanese industrial companies, Minebea had relied on the stock
market to boost earnings during the late 1980s, but the continuing weakness
of the market has forced these companies to book losses on their holdings.
Consolidated sales are likely to total Y270bn, down from a previous estimate
of Y280bn and last year's Y285.4bn, while the company is expecting net
losses of Y13.5bn, compared with profits of Y888m last year.
NMB, expecting losses of about Y12bn, has become a burden for Minebea
because of the severe competition in the semiconductor market, and the
company is planning to shift away from the production of standard memory
chips to application-specific chips.
But competition in the that market is also severe, and the cost of keeping
up in the semiconductor sector is putting extra pressure on Minebea when
sales of core products have slowed in tandem with the Japanese economy.
The forecast for parent company profits was revised down to Y8.5bn from
Y9.5bn on sales of Y200bn, down from Y207bn. Net profits were revised down
to Y2.7bn from Y4.8bn, and the parent is expecting to post book losses of
Y1.9bn on its securities holdings.
Minebea intends to pay an annual dividend of Y6, down from Y11.75 last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF Scotland is poised to complete its takeover of the Countrywide
Banking Corporation after the last rebel institutional shareholder, National
Mutual Association, agreed reluctantly to accept the offer for its 5.5 per
cent holding.
National Mutual had been fighting an acrimonious rear-guard struggle since
May in an effort to force Bank of Scotland to pay more than NZDollars 2.05 a
share, saying the offer, which valued Countrywide at Pounds 40.2m, was far
too low. It believed the shares to be worth at least NZDollars 2.40.
Two other dissident shareholders, Norwich Union and Colonial Mutual,
surrendered last month. National Mutual said its struggle was weakened by
the late acceptances of the others, but it had considered challenging
compulsory acquisition.
Bank of Scotland had sent dissidents a formal notice of compulsory
acquisition, giving them until November 5 to accept, and claiming it had
acceptances for 91.2 per cent.
National Mutual said it was accepting because any legal action would have
caused further uncertainties over the future of the bank. 'Even if we had
managed to retain the shares, their negotiability would have been limited."
Last year Countrywide incurred a pre-tax loss of NZDollars 40.9m (Pounds
11.6m) for the year to June 30, against profits of NZDollars 16.5m
previously after bad debt provisions of NZDollars 30.5m and a write off of
NZDollars 38m to purchase United Banking.

Schroders, the City merchant bank, confirmed yesterday that it is

house in which it has held a 50 per cent stake since 1986, writes David

However, the bank denied that active negotiations for a cash sale had got
under way. 'The future of our relationship with Wertheim has been under
discussion for some time, but there are no negotiations in progress,' the
bank said.
To acquire 100 per cent control of Wertheim, which made Dollars 30m profits
last year, would probably cost around Dollars 100m.

PAKISTAN'S former prime minister Benazir Bhutto led an opposition boycott of
the parliament's lower house yesterday after clashing with the government
over an alleged attempt to kill her last month, Reuter reports from
Islamabad.
Ms Bhutto and other deputies of her People's Democratic Alliance (PDA)
marched out of the house after Gohar Ayub Khan, the National Assembly
speaker, gave short shrift to their accusations.
Shujaat Hussain, the Interior minister, denied the PDA charge that ruling
party members attacked Ms Bhutto's caravan with gunfire, stones and sticks
when she visited Multan in Punjab province last month to meet victims of
devastating floods.
Ms Bhutto blamed members of the Pakistan Moslem League (PML) party of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif for the September 23 attack, which she branded a
conspiracy.
'This is a black day in the history of this parliament,' Ms Bhutto said
later. The alliance would decide its next move today, she added.
On Saturday, a court acquitted Ms Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari of
masterminding the murder of 29 people.
Prison officials said Mr Zardari, who was arrested in October 1990, was
still being held to face other charges, although this acquittal was his
fifth so far.

KUWAIT has chosen the US Abrams M1-A2 tank, similar to those which helped
the allies win the Gulf war against Iraq, as the main battle tank for its
army, the official Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) quoted Sheikh Ali Sabah
al-Salem al-Sabah, defence minister, as saying yesterday, Reuter reports

'the most responsive to Kuwaiti army requirements', the report went on.
But last night, Vickers of the UK, which had been competing for the
contract, said it had no knowledge of any decision and was surprised by the
report.
According to Kuna, Sheikh Ali said contacts were under way with the US
government to facilitate the purchase of the tanks made by General Dynamics.
Kuna did not say how many tanks Kuwait would buy or give the expected value
of the deal. British Challenger tanks competed with US tanks in desert
trials this summer for a contract expected to involve about 230 tanks and
spare parts in a deal worth Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission will today mount a vigorous defence of its powers to
draft Community policy, striking back at critics before Friday's EC summit
in Birmingham.
In a high-level meeting in Brussels, senior Commission officials will
finalise a paper on 'subsidiarity' - the principle of devolving powers to
the lowest appropriate level, which EC governments believe is vital to
recapture public support for the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, presented an outline of
the paper during talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, last
Saturday. Both sides described the talks as helpful in the UK-led effort to
prepare a political declaration on subsidiarity at the Birmingham summit.
In its paper, the Commission is expected to propose limited reforms in order
to counter charges that it is a remote, overcentralised bureaucracy.
The reforms are likely to include a pledge to consult member states fully
before proposing policy directives, as well as an explanation of why
Brussels believes an EC-wide directive is necessary.
The Commission is also likely to argue that no single area of Commission
competence should be targeted for attack; and that its power to be solely
responsible for drafting legislation must be left intact.
As EC president, the UK is leading diplomatic efforts to forge an EC
consensus on subsidiarity to help secure early ratification of the
Maastricht treaty, both in Britain and ahead of a likely second referendum
in Denmark.
British officials said yesterday the summit in Birmingham would focus on
'the way things are done', but an agreement on the general criteria for
subsidiarity might have to wait until the Edinburgh summit in December.
Another reform gaining ground is for the Council of Ministers to conduct
some of its business in public, to promote greater transparency in EC
decision-making.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Foreign groups to keep up California tax fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK of the UK and other foreign companies with operations in
California are to continue their eight-year legal challenge against the
state's 'unitary tax' method, despite a decision by the US Supreme Court not
to take up the case.
Unitary tax is calculated on the basis of a company's worldwide earnings and
taxes a portion of them according to the percentage of activity in the
state. A company that has 10 per cent of its world sales, property and
payroll in California, for example, would be taxed on 10 per cent of its
worldwide profits even if the California operation makes no profit. Most
other states and the US government base such taxes on a percentage of
profits reported within their borders.
Barclays Bank, with the support of other multinational corporations and
several foreign governments, filed a suit eight years ago charging that the
California tax assessment system was unconstitutional as it interfered with
the US federal government's ability to conduct foreign policy.
'The Supreme Court decision is a disappointment,' said Ms Joanne Garvey, a
San Francisco attorney acting for Barclays. But the fight would continue in
the California state court system where a decision was pending on another
element of the dispute, she said.
At issue is Dollars 792m in taxes paid up to 1988, when California relaxed
its unitary tax rules, offering foreign multinational companies an
alternative tax assessment method based only on US operations. Barclays, on
behalf of all foreign multinationals, is seeking a refund.
The California Supreme Court had referred back to the state Appeals Court
the issue of whether calculating unitary tax placed an unfair burden on
foreign multinationals, Ms Garvey said.
Barclays' challenge was presented to the country's chief justices after it
was rejected by the California Supreme Court in May. Last week they decided
unanimously not to reconsider the state court's decision.

<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian resources group, has restated its 1990/91 accounts after
settling a long-running dispute with the Australian Securities Commission
(ASC) over accounting practices.
The ASC queried CRA's treatment of several items as extraordinary rather
than abnormal, including a ADollars 134m (USDollars 95.7m) writedown of
downstream aluminium businesses and a ADollars 159m transfer of surplus
pension contributions.
CRA said it believed the treatment was acceptable under Australian
accounting standard AASB 1018. However, the group has accepted the ASC's
view that the standard 'is capable of other interpretations'.
The effect of the restatement is to increase CRA's net profits after
abnormal items to ADollars 396m from ADollars 350m. However, the bottom-line
losses after extraordinary items remains unchanged at ADollars 34m.
CRA also released restated results for Comalco, its 67 per cent-controlled
aluminium subsidiary. Comalco's net profits, after abnormals of ADollars
27m, become net losses of ADollars 67m, but the bottom-line losses remain
unchanged at ADollars 67m.

NIKON, the leading Japanese camera maker, expects not to make a profit in
the year to March, because of a steep fall in sales of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo.
The company blamed the downturn on severe cuts in investment among
electronics companies which are facing stagnant demand. About 43 per cent of
Nikon's sales come from cameras and 23 per cent from semi-conductor
equipment.
Nikon expects its sales to reach Y210bn (Dollars 1.74bn), down from its
earlier forecast of Y228bn. It had predicted pre-tax profits of Y4.5bn for
the year against Y7.2bn profit on sales of Y230bn last year.
The company warned that the fall in sales would continue for the rest of the
year.

<TEXT>
WORMS, the French holding company with interests in insurance, shipping and
luxury goods, sustained a sharp fall in first-half net profits to FFr379m
(Dollars 75.3m) from FFr1.11bn a year earlier, because of the downturn in
the property market.
Despite the profits downturn, Worms is pressing ahead with expanding its
insurance business by concluding a cross-shareholding agreement between
Athena, its insurance subsidiary, and Wurttembergische, a German insurer.
Under the deal Athena will hold 5 per cent of Wurttembergische which will
take 5 per cent of the French company.
The Wurttembergische deal is the latest in a series of alliances between
French and German insurance groups. Assurances Generales de France has built
up a sizeable holding in Aachener &amp; Munchener, while Union des Assurances de
Paris is in talks with France's Suez group to acquire an interest in
Colonia, another German insurer.

third quarter earnings

<TEXT>
A FALL in the price of aluminium has left third-quarter earnings of Aluminum
Co of America (Alcoa), the world's largest producer of the metal, 18 per
cent lower at Dollars 62.2m, or 72 cents per share, down from Dollars 75.9m,
or 88 cents, a year earlier. Sales slipped to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars
2.5bn.
For the first nine months earnings fell by 58 per cent to Dollars 107.6m, or
Dollars 1.24 a share, from Dollars 254.1m, or Dollars 2.97. A large part of
this fall was due to extraordinary second-quarter losses and special charges
of Dollars 104.7m, or Dollars 1.22 per share, relating to debt restructuring
and the sacking of about 2,500 employees. Excluding the special charges,
Alcoa's 1992 earnings to date came to to Dollars 212.3m, or Dollars 2.46 a
share.
The rest of the slide in nine month earnings was due to lower prices for
alumina, ingot, and most fabricated products, the company said.
Mr Victor Lazarovici, of S. G. Warburg in New York, said the results were
'surprisingly strong'. He pointed to the cost reductions, and noted that
Alcoa's realisations from manufactured products rose to Dollars 1.38 a
pound, up from Dollars 1.33 in the second quarter, and Dollars 1.30 in the
first.
As expected, the company's aluminium product shipments fell in the third
quarter, to 675,000 tonnes, from 726,000 a year earlier.
The third-quarter earnings were struck after unfavourable foreign exchange
adjustments of Dollars 8.1m compared with Dollars 7.4m.
Alcoa's stock closed down  1/8 at Dollars 64 1/8 on Wall Street after the
results were released on Friday.

Actuaries Share Indices. The new indices are:
The FT-SE Mid 250, covering the 250 companies that rank below the FT-SE 100
in size. This is a real-time index, containing companies with market
capitalisations of roughly Pounds 150m to Pounds 1bn.
The FT-SE Actuaries 350, the top 350 UK shares (the FT-SE 100 plus the FT-SE
Mid 250). Industry baskets based on these 350 stocks will be calculated
minute-by-minute throughout the day. The sector classification is that used
in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index.
The new indices form part of a newly created family, the FT-SE Actuaries
Share Indices. This also includes the FT-SE 100, the FT-Actuaries All-Share
index, the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 and 200 indices and (from January 1993) the
FT-SE Small Cap index.

<TEXT>
SEVERE COMPETITION and moves to prime high street sites has been blamed by
Specialeyes, the USM-quoted optical retailer, for a fall into pre-tax losses
of Pounds 596,000 in the year to May 30, against profits of Pounds 201,000.
The company has developed a new strategic plan, as part of which three new
directors have been appointed and Mr Andrew Noble, chairman, is being
replaced by Mr Jim Power, an existing non-executive director.
Sales rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 16.6m but were at the expense of
margins. They were affected by the recession and the uncertainty surrounding
the General Election. particularly the commitment of the Labour Party to
return to free sight tests which caused a severe fall in sales.
Losses per share came out at 3.13p (earnings of 2.04p).

<TEXT>
BUTTE Mining, which is claiming damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 182.5m) in
the US against more than 70 former advisers, directors and investors, is
about to embark on another legal action, this time in the UK, writes Peggy
Hollinger.
Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman of Butte, said that the company intended to
launch a warranty claim for more than Pounds 500,000 over a company
purchased in 1989.
Butte paid 9.2m shares for Gramcol Zircon, a mining company allegedly
holding cash resources which Butte desperately needed. The vendors were Mr
Don Upright, Mr Neil Bradley and Mr CJ Deacon, a solicitor.
In the summer, Mr Deacon was involved in assisting pension fund trustees of
Belling recover Pounds 2.1m paid to one of his clients.
The purchase agreement for Gramcol Zircon included warranties by the
vendors, excluding Mr Deacon, that the company would have 'not less than
Pounds 1.8m standing at credit in the company's bank account'. However,
Butte received just Pounds 1.25m from Gramcol Zircon's account.
Mr Deacon was paid 5m Butte shares as part of the Gramcol transaction. The
Pounds 1.25m appears to have been the proceeds of a placing of Mr Deacon's
shares by TC Coombs, the now defunct stockbroker.

FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ramco shares double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Aberdeen-based Ramco Oil Services have more than doubled on market
optimism over its involvement in a contract to develop a 1.4bn barrel
Azerbaijani oil field in the South Caspian Sea, writes Walton Morais.
Since the deal to develop the Guneshli field was announced on October 1, the
USM-quoted stock has doubled from 36p, to Friday's close of 74p.
Ramco, whose core activity is the supply of corrosion control and ancilliary
services to the oil and marine industries, will develop the field with
Pennzoil, the US oil group.
Pennzoil will bear all development costs and operate the field while Ramco
will enjoy a share of the profits thanks to its early role in lining up the
deal.
Ramco's share of profits will be 10 per cent in the initial stage rising to
17.5 per cent with a full participating interest after Pennzoil has
recovered its costs.
Mr Stephen Remp, the 45-year-old American chairman and chief executive who
founded the company, explained that the favourable terms to Ramco stem from
its pathfinding role in securing the contract from the Azerbaijani
government.
Current production in the Guneshli field was 130,000 barrels per day and
should increase to 270,000 when the field was in full production.

FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Clark rebels under heavy fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW over control of C&amp;J Clark, Britain's biggest shoe manufacturer, grew
increasingly heated this weekend with a letter to shareholders dismissing
accusations by boardroom rebels as 'untrue and inaccurate'.
In a scathing attack on the rebels, five directors - including two members
of the founding Clark family - urged shareholders to vote against proposals
to dismiss chairman Mr Walter Dickson and non-executive director Mr James
Power.
The letter claimed the four board rebels - all Clark family members - had
'misused confidential information and made untrue and inaccurate statements
 . If they have done this as requisitionists, how would they behave if they
controlled the company?'
A company spokesman denied reports that the family was holding peace talks
at the weekend. Some 500 members of the Clark family hold more than 70 per
cent of the company.
The letter to shareholders countered claims by the requisitionists that
recommendations in a consultants report dated 1988 had been ignored. This
was a 'red herring which disguises a straightforward attempt to gain board
control', the letter stated. The company quotes the consultants, McKinsey,
in 1991 as saying that Clarks had 'performed creditably' against a difficult
market background.
The five board members defended the corporate strategy directed by Mr
Dickson. They predicted that by 1995 the company would achieve cost savings
of Pounds 12m a year from rationalisation in its retail business - which
includes Clarks, K Shoes and Ravel - and Pounds 25m in manufacturing.
An extraordinary meeting has been called for this Friday to decide the
issue. The rebels are proposing two new board members, Mr Hugh Pym, an ITN
journalist and a member of the Clark family, and Mr Michael Markham, a
businessman.
It is believed that Electra Investment Trust, the venture capital group
which is backing a possible bid approach by Mr Colin Fisher, a consultant,
would hold back from any firm offer until the outcome of the egm.

FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: WMS raising Pounds 15m via share placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WMS Group is to raise about Pounds 15m in a placing of shares in the last
week of November. The new shares will account for about 40 per cent of the
enlarged share capital - the balance will remain with Mr Joe Moore, the
chairman and founder, and his family. After the placing, the company will be
valued at about Pounds 45m.
Originally Window Machinery Sales - though Mr Moore maintains that the
company's initials stand for Work Means Success - WMS has grown into a
designer, developer and distributor of window hardware and related domestic
and industrial fasteners. It is now branching into silicones and sealants.
Almost all the company's products are sourced outside the UK - mainly in
Taiwan, the Philippines and India. Wong Shi, the Taiwanese subsidiary,
oversees all WMS' Far Eastern activities.
Mr Moore said that, despite the problems of the construction industry,
replacement windows was a 'buoyant market' and that he ran a 'nice clean
business'. WMS has no debt and Mr Moore said the placing was to finance
organic growth - the company has in the past few months moved into the
decorative hardware and decorative sundries markets. 'More product
penetration is needed,' he said.
The company employs 220 staff and operates from its national distribution
centre which sits on an 11 1/2 acre site in Brighouse, near Leeds, bought
from Coloroll, the collapsed home furnishings group, for Pounds 1.9m in
1989.
A prospective p/e of between 11.5 and 15, with 13.5 the likeliest, has been
forecast. WMS has predicted profits for 1992 of more than Pounds 3m
post-tax, compared with Pounds 1.72m in 1991, on turnover of Pounds
25m-plus, against Pounds 20.2m. The company will pay dividends, Mr Moore
said.

FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Firstland makes Pounds 5m move into
packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTON MORAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRSTLAND Group proposes to buy Gelpack Industrial, a private industrial
packaging company, for Pounds 4.8m under a reorganisation that will
transform the USM-quoted oil and gas company into a packaging business
listed on the main market, writes Walton Morais.
Firstland, suspended since September 15 pending the reorganisation, will
change its name to Britton Group and fund the acquisition by a placement of
102m new ordinary shares with private and institutional investors to raise
Pounds 5.1m before expenses.
Mr Simon Beart, finance director, who with Mr Robin Williams, chief
executive, led a management buy-in last March with the aim of diversifying
into an industrial group with stable earnings, said Gelpack was involved in
a low-volume, high-margin niche sector of a growing market.
It had been showing strong growth in pre-tax profit recently, jumping from
Pounds 214,000 in the year ended June 30 1990 to Pounds 706,000 in 1991 and
Pounds 1.05m in 1992. Turnover expanded from Pounds 7.93m to Pounds 11.03m
and Pounds 11.55m.
Firstland will want to dispose of its remaining oil and gas business
quickly; probably below the estimated book value of Pounds 3m for its
operating oil and gas wells in Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico.
The reorganisation will include a capital reduction and elimination of the
deficit on the profit and loss account.
Barring unforeseen circumstances, the directors intend to recommend a final
dividend payable in mid-1993 for the year 1992.
For the first half Firstland reduced its loss from Pounds 455,000, which
included a Pounds 285,000 exceptional charge, to Pounds 87,000, on turnover
of Pounds 201,000 (Pounds 233,000). Losses per share were 0.34p (2.05p).

FT  12 OCT 92 / Letter: 'Foul play' to stress delay of Channel Tunnel
opening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALASTAIR MORTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Appeals to financial editors for fair play face an uncertain fate, but
the treatment last week of the Channel Tunnel opening date casts real doubt
on the 'rules' by which financial editors like to tell us the game should be
played.
Companies are exhorted to keep information flowing through the financial
columns to investors and shareholders in the eminently justifiable interest
of a fair market.
In October 1987, Eurotunnel issued a prospectus based on an opening date of
May 15 1993. With early tunnelling well behind schedule, Eurotunnel as
client conceded June 15 1993 to TML, the turnkey contractor. This remained
the best estimate until early 1992 and is still the target date in the only
programme to which TML has bound itself. As everyone knows, TML made up the
time lost in early tunnelling and finished a few days early in June 1991.
Sadly, TML's fitting out of the tunnels and terminals under a fixed price
contract has not gone well. As a result, by early 1992 it was apparent that
June 1993 could not be met. Accordingly, a Eurotunnel press release on
February 10 1992 said:
'The tunnel should be able to open at the end of summer 1993', and our
preliminary annual report on April 24 this year said: 'Eurotunnel remains
confident that the system can be opened for commercial services no later
than the fourth quarter of 1993. . .'
During the summer we have used 'autumn 1993' in conversations with
journalists and in brochures, even in paid advertisements in the Financial
Times and elsewhere. We have also used 'fourth quarter 1993' in many
briefings. We have met every possible demand from any financial editor for
up-to-date clarity.
Hence you must surely agree that when we sharpen our 'fourth quarter 1993'
into 'December 15 1993', it was foul play to place almost universal emphasis
on news of six or seven months of delay in your reporting of our half-year
statement ('Eurotunnel shares hit by delay warning', October 6). The FT
started with 'the announcement of a seven month delay'. The Telegraph,
Express, Independent and some TV reports were similar; The Times' headline
was 'tunnel will open six months late'.
If editors campaign for up-to-date information, editors have a
responsibility to keep pace with it and not - in haste or malice - dig out
long-superseded information for use without any qualifying description.
As I write, our share price has recovered a third of the 60p or so it lost
early this week. Were some sellers misled by the media?

An odd thing has been happening to the relationship between the Bank of
England's supervision department and the chairmen of big UK banks.
Several chairmen have privately expressed the view that the Bank should
adopt more aggressive tactics in the way it monitors the soundness of banks
 -an apparent case of turkeys voting for Christmas.
Until recently there was a consensus among bankers that their
non-adversarial relationship with the Bank works well. But now some are
suggesting that it would be a useful discipline if the supervisors were more
interventionist - their lenders, for example, might have shown more caution
in the late 1980s if subject to greater Bank scrutiny.
The City-wide discussion on banking supervision has been prompted by press
accounts of Lord Justice Bingham's forthcoming report into the role played
by the UK authorities prior to the closure of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International in 1991. This long-awaited report is likely to be
published next week.
The BCCI affair probably does not point to serious flaws in the law relating
to bank supervision. It is the implementation of the law which appears
unsatisfactory.
The main purpose of banking supervision is to protect depositors. At the
heart of the 1987 Banking Act is the requirement that no one should take
deposits from the public without being authorised by the Bank of England.
In deciding whether to give this authorisation, the main issue for the
Bank's supervision department is whether a bank is financially sound
according to a set of standards described in general terms in the act. The
detailed description of the standards are enshrined in a statement of
principles drawn up by the Bank of England itself.
There are at least two BCCI episodes which indicate flaws in the UK
supervisory system. In the first, during the spring and summer of 1990, the
Bank should probably have become more directly involved in an attempt to
rescue and reorganise BCCI.
At the time, Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor, had passed to the Bank
details of BCCI transactions which were either 'false or deceitful', in PW's
words. The Bank, which had long mistrusted BCCI, insisted at the time that
the bank would only be allowed to continue in business in the UK if it
received a substantial injection of new capital and if its structure was
reorganised.
This new capital was promised by Abu Dhabi, the Gulf emirate, which also
gave a commitment to reorganise BCCI. At the time it may have been
justifiable for the Bank to allow BCCI to continue trading, in the interests
of protecting depositors, who would have incurred heavy losses if the bank
had been wound up.
But in view of BCCI's questionable past and parlous financial condition, it
might have been advisable for the Bank to place its own representatives into
BCCI to ensure that the rescue took place efficiently and speedily. At the
least, senior Bank supervisors should probably have established close
contact with high-ranking Abu Dhabi officials.
Had the Bank been more involved in BCCI's affairs in 1990, it might have
uncovered evidence of the systematic fraud which it eventually did discover
and which led to BCCI's closure on July 5 1991.
There was a second salutary episode in the BCCI affair. Detailed information
on the fraud was passed to Bank officials in early 1991. But senior Bank
directors, with the ultimate responsibility for any decision on whether to
close BCCI, did not appreciate the magnitude of the corruption until the end
of June.
In the first three months of 1991, PW uncovered details of every major
element of the fraud at BCCI. Its partners were part of a team set up by
BCCI in October 1990 to investigate fraud at the bank. The team reported to
BCCI's investigating committee on February 26 in Abu Dhabi and outlined
every substantial area of fraud at BCCI. These included:
a cover-up of loss-making loan accounts by transferring funds from other
accounts;
failure to record deposits;
creation of false accounts;
the misappropriation of funds managed by ICIC, an offshoot of BCCI;
the disguised ownership of US banks in contravention of US law;
the extent of losses incurred by BCCI's Treasury division;
PW communicated full details to the Bank. But Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank
director responsible for supervision, has said that it was not until the
Bank received a formal report on BCCI, under section 41 of the Banking Act,
on June 22 1991 that he felt able to close the bank: 'The section 41 report
completely transformed our view of BCCI,' he told a Commons select committee
earlier this year.
However, both PW and Abu Dhabi told Lord Bingham that they were surprised
that the Bank had to wait for the section 41 report to appreciate the extent
of the corruption.
What the BCCI episodes indicate is the need for cultural change at the Bank,
say bankers. It is thought highly likely that there will be staff changes at
the Bank after the publication of the Bingham report.
But changes in personnel may not be a full remedy. Had the bulk of BCCI's
operations been in the US, teams of bank inspectors would probably have been
drafted into BCCI to investigate its affairs and implement the
reorganisation planned in 1990.
Scrutiny of the Banking Act and the Statement of Principles show that the
Bank had the powers to become more directly involved in BCCI's affairs. But
in its relationship with BCCI stretching back more than a decade, it showed
a consistent reluctance to interfere directly.
In part, the Bank may, however, have been hamstrung by a shortage of the
appropriate resources. Even today, its supervision department contains only
200 professionals, who derive the bulk of their information from reports
supplied by banks and their accountants. The Bank has only 15 executives
specialising in on-site examinations of banks and a further 10 investigators
who probe alleged Banking Act offences. Both teams should probably be
expanded. But the Bank may also need to adopt some US practices and become
more interventionist and adversarial in its relationship with banks.
In the supervision of banks the Bank has extensive independence from
government. Some Treasury officials are arguing that the Bank would be less
complacent if it was directly answerable to the Treasury, as is the
Securities and Investments Board, regulator of financial institutions other
than banks. But given the SIB's difficulty in establishing a clear role for
itself, the benefits of government tutelage are not axiomatic.
An opportunity to bring about the requisite changes has been presented by
the impending retirement of the current governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton.
The conclusions of the Bingham inquiry may determine whether the government
appoints a sucessor committed to reform and with no ties to the ancien
regime.

<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer, in his article on Czech/Slovak relations (Foreign
Affairs, October 7), claims the viability of a constitutional half-way house
is not affected by the starting point, whether it be a faltering federation
such as Czecho-Slovakia or long-established nation states as in the EC.
This is nonsense. In the latter case, independent states have come to
comprehend the limits of their sovereignty and interdependence on others. In
the former, nations of a faltering federation, by definition, resent their
interdependence and one or more longs for sovereignty for the first time.
It appears that interdependence can only be appreciated after experiencing
full-blooded sovereignty. Klaus (economic liberal) and Havel (liberal) are
correct in rejecting a half-way house. So, dare I say it, was Milosevic
(communist) in the case of the former Yugoslavia.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Letter: Perhaps UK should contemplate a future with Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LINDA MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If you will permit this intrusion from a Yank, may I make a suggestion
for Mr John Major? Perhaps, while the UK reviews the structure of power in
the European Community and contemplates the future, it should consider
joining the North American Free Trade Association (Nafta).
The Nafta agreement has not yet been initialled, and it will be several
years before it has a significant impact on the economies of its member
countries. The long-term plans for Nafta, however, include alliances with
countries based on common economic goals, not geographic proximity.
To have the UK as a member of Nafta would surely benefit us all. For the US,
we would be helped by having another strong partner, offsetting some
concerns - particularly from Canada - about our domination of the pact. It
would also alleviate some of our concerns about job losses to Mexico with
the possibility of new investment from the Brits, already a significant
factor in our economy. Your presence would enhance the treaty's chance for
success, both in its initial years and in realising its potential for
worldwide growth.
For the UK, there would be new opportunities for trade and new access
channels to the booming economies of South America. To the extent that Nafta
would enhance the UK's economic vitality, you would be better equipped to
negotiate with the Franco-German alliance which, it seems, has definitively
taken over the leadership of the European Community.
I believe that including the UK in Nafta would greatly enhance the members'
comparative strengths in telecommunications and computer technologies,
medicine, and financial services, for example, as well as improving
productivity and growth in manufacturing sectors.

<TEXT>
Sir, I write as a very cost/benefit conscious New Zealander living in
England to comment on Mrs Dalmahoy's letter (October 7) as follows:
(i) I have an English husband who is paranoid that I buy British made goods
in preference to foreign ones provided that their performance is at least
equivalent to that of the latter. I have had very little difficulty in
complying with this.
(ii) It appears many English people feel that foreign products give them
enhanced status despite there being at least equivalent UK products.
(iii) Life in a distant colony has encouraged a widespread attitude of
self-sufficiency. An increase in this attribute in the UK could have the
following results: buyers (individual and corporate) should proactively seek
to buy British products;
industrialists should actively seek to develop more products with the object
of displacing imports (retailers would be well advised to assist in this
process) and more internationally tradeable goods and services (preferably
ones which sell primarily on characteristics other than price).
By adopting these attitudes we have the power to influence the country's
economic future irrespective of the government's action or inaction.

Sad to see Anglo-German relations plumbing further depths at the latest
lunch in London held by the German Wine Information Service.
Its intention was to demonstrate how delightfully the products of the
country's vineyards, normally drunk as aperitifs, go down when matched with
food. And 25 writers about wine and purveyors thereof duly assembled for the
treat . . . which they might have ended up enjoying if only the wine
supplies hadn't run out.
Only two bottles of each of the dozen varieties to be sampled had been
provided which, even allowing for the 15 pours per bottle possible in a
tasting, was never going to be enough.
Eventually, one of the organisers had the bright idea of popping out to the
local off-licence. Alas, when he came back with the seemingly statutory two
bottles, the German red wine inside them was not only at best uninspiring,
but one of them was decidedly off.

The old adage that youthful hours spent gaining qualifications are never
wasted has found a new upholder in Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester
East who seems to have cornered the market in government-bashing on behalf
of BCCI creditors.
A qualified albeit non-practising barrister, he last week dusted off his
legal credentials to get himself a hearing in the Luxembourg court
considering the compensation agreement negotiated between Touche Ross, the
BCCI liquidators and Abu Dhabi.
'The only way to address the court was as a legal person,' says Vaz, whom
the proceedings scarcely impressed. His reason for intervening, he explains,
was that 'basically the Luxembourg lawyers are pretty useless and they were
not putting the case at all, and it was all in French. I don't know whether
they understood what I said because I spoke in English.'

Meanwhile a designer with a fair claim to having run the full gamut of his
profession is France's Philippe Starck. His output ranges from the
monumental in the shape of Osaka office complexes, to a user-friendly
toothbrush.
He is now moving into the middle with houses - not the expensively
customised sort, but mass-market homes ordinary people can afford.
The stubbly-chinned Starck's idea is to design a series of houses, and sell
the blueprints through a mail-order catalogue. His customers would then
present the designs to a building firm.
But, for the sake of the catalogue buyers, it is to be hoped that he puts
more thought into the houses than he has into some of his other products. He
claims he once designed a chair in the time that it took an aircraft
seatbelt-sign to switch from on to off.

Gleave's city of Glasgow seems out to disrupt the plans of effervescent
Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, to extend
his empire in Edinburgh with the opening there of a new gallery of Scottish
art.
It is the pushy Glaswegians who are making the running with sites for the
display of Scottish painting down the centuries. They have already offered
the trustees of the National Gallery, led by merchant banker Angus Grossart,
free-of-charge space either next to their Kelvingrove Park art gallery or in
the old sheriff court building in the city centre.
By contrast the more complacent Edinburgh has offered no free sites.
Either way, Scottish secretary Ian Lang will have a knotty decision to make
when the trustees put their recommendation to him, probably next month.
Unless he is willing to punish Edinburgh for failing to make more of a play
for the new institution, he could be seen as penalising Glasgow for not
electing any Conservative MPs.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Observer: Remember Rodrigo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Give credit where credit's due' was the watchword of Observer's
grandmother. Accordingly, amid all the furore of what looks to be the most
controversial 500th anniversary on record, it is surely time to acknowledge
the first European known to have discovered the Americas.
By now, of course, everybody has heard that it wasn't Christopher Columbus,
who is authoritatively claimed to have been preceded by Vikings or even
fishermen from Bristol. If so, however, nobody knows their names.
Step forward, therefore, the shade of the first European identified as
having set eyes on the new continent: Rodrigo from Triana, the look-out
aboard the 50ft caravel Pinta who sighted the island of San Salvador a few
hours more than half a millennium ago.
While remembering him, we might also spare a thought for Joseph from
Britain, designer of Santo Domingo's newly opened commemorative lighthouse -
which, given the length of its gestation as well as its lack of practical
utility, must rank high among the White Elephants of history.
Joseph Gleave was still an architecture student when he won a competition
for the design in 1928, He finally went to the site in 1946, only for work
to be stopped five years later when funds ran out. The project was revived
in the 1960s by Dominican Republic president Joaquin Balaguer. But by then
the architect had died, having in the meantime set up a practice in Glasgow
and designed, among other things, Prestwick Airport.
So how do Gleave's successors feel about his transatlantic masterwork?
His former assistant John McCulloch, who was at last week's opening, thinks
the cross-shaped concrete structure will be a big tourist attraction.
Gleave's son David is less enthusiastic. 'I think the problem is that it was
designed 60 years before it was built,' he said.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Gloom worsens in financial services sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PICTURE of deepening gloom and pessimism in Britain's financial services
companies emerges from the quarterly survey of business confidence in the
sector published by the Confederation of British Industry and Coopers &amp;
Lybrand today.
The report says that financial services companies are delaying new
investments because they are worried about their business prospects and
believe they risk making a net loss on any developments they plan.
In contrast to the second quarter of the year, when companies were
increasingly confident about their business prospects, many of the 300
companies surveyed - ranging from banks and building societies to
stockbrokers and venture capitalists - saw their business volumes dwindle
between July and September.
The fall in volumes affected both wholesale and personal business and was
followed by a sharp drop in confidence, particularly among building
societies, securities traders and fund managers.
The only improvement came from business with overseas customers.
There was some good news, however, for the financial services sector. Income
from fees and commissions rose strongly and lenders widened their average
spreads, but banks said their margins and fee income had improved more
slowly than expected.
Almost all financial services companies are cutting costs sharply for the
fourth quarter in succession. Banks, finance houses, and securities traders
lead the way, although insurance brokers say that their total costs have
strongly increased.
While the squeeze on costs has led to a continuing fall in the numbers
employed in the sector, the drop was not as sharp in the third quarter of
the year as it was in the second.
Staff costs make up a much smaller proportion of total company costs than
they did a year ago.
Financial services companies expect the cost-cutting to continue for the
rest of the year, but the resulting profitability gains are partly offset by
their non-performing loans.
In order to help themselves through the recession, financial services
companies are holding back on spending capital on developing their
businesses.
The survey reports significant cuts in planned spending on land and
buildings, as well as on vehicles, plant, and machinery over the next 12
months. There are also signs that companies will spend less on developing
computer systems and on information technology generally next spring.
The only chink of light in the generally gloomy scene seems to be that most
companies expect profits to rise slightly in the last three months of the
year, as fewer bad debts and lower costs take their effect.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Optimism in commerce falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST survey of business confidence in the UK, published yesterday by
Dun and Bradstreet International, the business information company, shows
the sharpest decline in expectations for profits, sales and new orders in
commerce since the spring of 1990.
The report, the first national survey of business confidence since the
government was forced to suspend sterling from the European exchange rate
mechanism on September 16, reflects deepening gloom in most sectors of the
economy.
In two areas, retailing and construction, the outlook seems particularly
bleak. According to the survey, retailers anticipate declining sales volumes
in spite of an aggressive price-cutting strategy, while most building firms
are forecasting static order books at best.
The overall survey of business confidence - in which 1,900 managing
directors throughout the UK were interviewed - discloses a marked decline in
optimism over sales volumes.
Six out of 10 companies expect no upturn in sales in the final quarter of
this year, while 39 per cent actually expect sales to decrease. Dun and
Bradstreet's optimism index, a method of calculating business confidence,
shows that the current quarter-to-quarter decline is the steepest since the
fourth quarter of 1989 and the first of 1990.
The bleak outlook for sales is matched by a severe decline in expectation of
profits. Only 21 per cent of companies predicted improved profits in the
next three months. For the first time for more than a year, Dun and
Bradstreet has found that more businesses are expecting profits to decrease
rather than to increase in the ensuing three months.
Analysing its survey by sectors, Dun and Bradstreet found that retailers
remained among the most pessimistic - with 46 per cent saying they expected
sales to fall in the final quarter of this year. According to the report,
suppliers to the retail sector will suffer greatly and will find orders very
thin on the ground.
There was deepening gloom in the construction sector, where 61 per cent of
companies expect further declines in sales in the next quarter and 67 per
cent predict reduced profits.
The most bullish sector appeared to be manufacturing - being the only one
apart from services where managers were willing to raise stock levels in
anticipation of increased sales.
One of the few bright spots in the survey was the outlook for exports. There
was a smaller fall in the optimism over exports than in the optimism over
retail sales. According to Dun and Bradstreet: 'The most confident exporter
sectors are services and durable manufacturers who will be hoping to reap
the benefits of the floating pound.'
Nevertheless, the fall in export optimism was the largest for two years.
Confidence in an export-led recovery does not appear as strong as might have
been expected after sterling's devaluation.
Chemists and drugstores are proving far more resilient to the recession than
most other retailers, according to a report from Verdict, the retail
consultants.
The study found that the sector was underpinned by shoppers who were
continuing to buy essential health and personal-care products.
Sales in the sector rose 8 per cent to Pounds 8.3bn last year, outstripping
the 5.5 per cent increase in total retail sales. However, slowing inflation
has limited sales increases in the chemists and drugstores sector to about 5
per cent in the current year.
Verdict says that, in spite of diversification, traditional pharmacists are
still highly dependent on prescriptions, which account for 46 per cent of
their sales.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Government seeks room to move in a tight corner: Holding
public-sector pay down is central to keeping spending within planned totals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH on the agenda of the cabinet's two public-expenditure committee
meetings this week will be how to go about creating a strategy for slashing
public-sector pay awards.
However, the scope for influencing pay this year is restricted, as
settlements for two thirds of public-sector workers have already been made.
The government has room to manoeuvre on settlements for only a few workers,
including teachers and nurses. Their pay increases, due for implementation
next April, are recommended by independent review bodies that are taking
evidence at present and will make their recommendations in the next few
months.
The deliberations are therefore concentrated on next year. Pushing down
settlements is central to the government's fight to keep public spending
within the Pounds 244.5bn planned total for 1993-94. Public-sector pay,
covering about 6m workers, including civil servants, amounts to about Pounds
70bn a year.
No decisions have been taken yet by the special cabinet committee shaping
spending priorities, but a wide range of options is being considered - from
pay freezes for those employees within ministers' direct control such as
Whitehall civil servants, to suspension of the independent pay review bodies
that cover about 2.4m people including doctors, nurses and teachers.
Although the government has fought shy of setting a formal pay 'norm' for
the public sector, it is widely assumed that it would like to keep increases
in public-sector pay to about 2 per cent a year, its long-term inflation
target.
'A very firm downward pressure is needed,' says Mr Chris Trinder of the
Public Finance Foundation, an independent research body. 'But government
must not panic. It needs a strategy it can deliver over the medium to longer
term. What it must not do, as it has done for the past 10 years, is
discriminate in favour of groups like nurses at the expense of
local-government workers.'
The fact that pay in the public sector has outstripped private-sector pay
for the first time since 1986 - reflecting the fact that pay in the public
sector tends to do better during a recession - presents the cabinet with an
opportunity to argue for low public-sector settlements.
The government's earnings survey, published last month, showed that earnings
in the public sector averaged Pounds 307.80 a week in April, compared with
Pounds 303.30 in the private sector, increases of 8.8 per cent and 6.3 per
cent respectively on the previous April.
Settlements since April have maintained that trend, albeit at low rates of
increase. Many stretch well into next year, including those of the 1.5m
local authority workers. Their pay cannot be influenced until July next year
for white-collar workers and September next year for manual workers.
First in the pack for settlements next April is the pay of workers covered
by the review bodies. Such bodies have traditionally made high settlements,
which are seen by other unions as benchmarks.
Unions have in the last month made claims to their review bodies of between
9 per cent and 16 per cent for teachers and 8.7 per cent for nurses. Mr John
Patten, education secretary, gave the teachers' review body a heavy hint
last month to keep down the cost of April's salary awards.
Mr Patten, who wants to link all or a large proportion of the pay bill to
performance rather than through national awards, told the review body: 'It
is unacceptable if, over time, the review bodies recommend settlements in
excess of those being obtained . . . in the private and public sectors.'
This year's pay settlement for teachers was 7.8 per cent.
If the review bodies ignore ministers' cajoling and set high awards, the
government has the option of either rejecting them or phasing them in - as
it has done four times over the past nine years for nurses.
Phasing in awards does not solve financial problems, however. Mr Trinder
says: 'Staging is not a solution - it merely defers a problem.'
Another option would be to suspend the pay review bodies and impose
settlements directly. However, such action would provoke fury among those
affected, particularly nurses, many of whom are employed by the new National
Health Service trusts which are starting to make redundancies to balance
their books.
Ministers are not afraid of conflict, including taking on bodies such as
Nalgo, the public-sector union. That has dismayed local authorities who are
responsible for the pay of 1.5m workers. Through rate-support grants paid to
local authorities, the government can and is likely to influence directly
what councils pay their staff next year.
Mr Stephen Bubb, secretary of the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, says his association is exploring the possibility
of a partial freeze next year - a small increase for low-paid staff and a
pay freeze for those earning more. But he says: 'Ministers talking about it
being 'quite nice' to have a strike with Nalgo undermines these efforts.'
He adds: 'The government cannot legislate for what we pay our employees. But
it may leave us little room for manoeuvre. If the total pay bill can only be
roughly the same as last year, we will have to make redundancies and/or cut
services.'

PEUGEOT Talbot is joining Rover and Vauxhall in cutting its dealer margins
on new car sales to 10 per cent.
The move, effective from Monday next week, will leave only Ford among the UK
'big four' non-Japanese producers still giving its dealers margins of
between 16 per cent and 17 per cent. As with the Rover and Vauxhall margin
reductions, the move is expected to have little effect on the prices
customers pay for its cars.
New list prices from next Monday will be, on average, 5.5 per cent lower,
but dealers' discretion to discount will have been reduced by a similar
amount.
The French vehicle group's wholly owned UK importer said last night: 'The
intention is to bring some sanity to the market. All the research has shown
that motorists do not like having to search out big discounts, and always
having the suspicion that they might have got a better deal down the road.'
Dealers were told of the restructuring at meetings last week and appear to
support the move. It is also expected to create a more orderly used-car
market for Peugeots, with stronger resale values.
So far Ford, the UK market leader, shows no sign of wishing to restructure
its dealer margins, insisting that larger margins give dealers greater
operating flexibility.
Meanwhile BMW (GB), the German executive carmaker's wholly owned UK
importer, is understood to have told its dealers that it proposes to raise
prices by 6 per cent and reduce dealer margins by 2 per cent from the start
of next year, to compensate for the devaluation of sterling against the
D-Mark.
The proposal follows a warning that BMW would need price rises of up to 14
per cent to compensate fully for currency shifts, but that market conditions
made a rise of such a size unrealistic.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Job loss warning for British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 100,000 jobs could eventually be lost if British Coal goes ahead with
its 'devastating' pit closure programme this week, Mr Stephen Fothergill,
director of the Coalfield Communities Campaign, said yesterday.
He said companies that service and supply the coal industry will be forced
to lay off thousands of workers after the announcement expected this week
that 20 collieries are to close with the loss of 20,000 miners' jobs.
Between 5,000 and 10,000 rail jobs may also be wiped out, along with
thousands of private contractors' jobs, he added. 'It is an absolutely
devastating picture,' he said.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Tax switch urged to boost R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX INCENTIVES would en-courage companies to invest in research and
development far more effectively than current government schemes, according
to a survey published today by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm.
The firm's high-technology practice polled 324 companies in the sector. It
found 86 per cent in favour of a so-called 'negative-tax incentive' over the
grant system, which they said was too project-specific.
Negative tax would include companies that do not pay tax, but the survey was
not designed to come up with detailed policy proposals.
Mr Nick Ward, KPMG tax specialist, said some high-technology companies found
the government grant system too restrictive. 'They would prefer help in some
way through the tax system,' he said. 'This would give them greater freedom
to pursue perceived market needs in setting R&amp;D priorities, rather than
tailoring their research to meet government's conditions for grant
assistance.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / Call to speed up road planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIME it takes to get big road construction schemes under way could be
cut from 13 years to four under radical proposals published by the National
Economic Development Office today, Richard Tomkins writes.
Nedo's report comes just days after Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary,
announced an urgent investigation into the reasons for the long delays in
planning road schemes.
At present, most big trunk road and motorway schemes take up to 13 years to
bring to construction because of long-winded public consultation procedures.
Nedo believes a streamlined procedure would prove popular with road-scheme
opponents and cut planning time. It proposes that:
The Department of Transport should publish a 10-year plan for all forms of
transport.
The DoT should hand over responsibility for roadbuilding to an executive
agency that could compete with the private sector for contracts.
The first stage of any road scheme would be a conference of interested
parties to agree a tentative plan.
That would be subjected to an environmental impact assessment, then put on
display for public comment before being submitted for planning permission.
An inquiry could still be held, but would consider only matters of detail.
Once the plan was published, anyone affected would be able to sell their
land at market value plus a bonus of 20 per cent. If they opposed the scheme
at a public inquiry, they would lose the bonus.

<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange should do more to enforce the code of practice proposed
by the Cadbury committee on corporate governance, the deputy president of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has warned.
Mr Roger Lawson, speaking at the Board of Chartered Accountants in Business
conference in Bristol at the weekend, said he was personally 'disappointed'
in the attitude of the Stock Exchange.
He said the exchange had indicated that it was not willing to threaten to
de-list quoted companies that failed to abide by the code.
He said that Cadbury was a 'missed opportunity' as companies operating
honourably were abiding by guidelines similar to those proposed, while
others would always find ways round them.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Treasury projections play second fiddle to party politics:
How Norman Lamont asked economists to 'massage' PSBR figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE week before this year's Budget statement on March 10, the lights in
the Treasury's imposing building in Whitehall were burning especially late.
Several Treasury economists were kept at their desks until midnight in an
effort to comply with a particularly direct request from Mr Norman Lamont
about the projections for the public-sector borrowing requirement that the
Treasury was to publish with the Budget.
In an internal note, the chancellor had told the economists to 'massage' the
figures to show a zero PSBR by 1996-97, to put the markets in better heart
ahead of the general election planned for April 9.
The note is now buried away in Treasury files, but its existence has been
verified by someone close to the Treasury forecasting process. Contacted
about the note, the Treasury said it could neither confirm nor deny whether
it had been sent, as what went on in the forecasting process was an internal
matter not for discussion with outsiders.
Details of how the note came to be drafted and the work that it sparked off
provide some indication of the largely hidden pressures that can be brought
to bear on Treasury economists to make their judgments fit the political
requirements of the ministers they serve.
News of the manoeuvrings come at a delicate time for the Treasury. During
this long recession, it has been attacked by some politicians and
industrialists for making over-optimistic forecasts.
The Treasury is now examining whether more contacts with outside economists
and business people could lead to more accurate economic assessments.
Also, some MPs and former Treasury officials have raised questions about the
whole process of Treasury forecasts. They want the procedure to be made more
transparent, to clarify to what degree the Treasury's projections are
influenced by pure economic reasoning, as opposed to judgments by
politicians.
In the past year, there has been increasing interest in 'de-politicising'
Treasury forecasts, handing the job of making them to an independent
external body.
About 40 economists at the Treasury are involved in its economic
projections, which cover areas such as growth in gross domestic product,
inflation and the balance of payments. They are answerable to Mr Alan Budd,
chief economic adviser, and are split into two teams.
The first is headed by Mr Colin Mowl and is responsible for short-term
forecasts, up to 1 1/2 years ahead. The second group, headed by Mr Chris
Riley, is concerned with longer-term assessments of up to five years ahead.
The numbers produced by this second group are always called in Treasury
parlance 'projections' rather than 'forecasts' - but they have to be
consistent with the shorter-term predictions of Mr Mowl's team.
In making forecasts, which it publishes twice a year, the Treasury has to
strike a difficult balance between giving an honest view of the future and
being reasonably optimistic in a way that will help the government's
political fortunes.
It is generally accepted that the forecasts will have a political spin. The
Treasury insists that ministers reserve the final judgment on what to
publish in the forecasts, after taking advice from officials.
The March forecast came at a crucial time, just before the general election,
when the government's fortunes were directly tied to thoughts about whether
and at what pace economic recovery would take place.
Few members of the electorate read Treasury forecasts - but their indirect
impact is large. Treasury projections set the broad tone for much City
thinking about economic trends - which is then translated into a view about
the economy that has an impact on the population as a whole.
Thus Mr Lamont knew that the Budget forecast could be an important factor in
determining the government's chances of pulling off an electoral victory.
The chancellor had already let it be known within the Treasury that he would
be ill-disposed to see too low a number put on likely economic growth for
1992 and 1993.
That led the Treasury economists to publish in March a projection for GDP
growth in 1992 of 1 per cent. Although not wildly at variance with City
forecasts at the time, this was described by one Whitehall insider as 'the
high-growth scenario with knobs on'. The Treasury also opted in the Budget
for a projection of about 3.1 per cent for growth in 1993, well above the
City consensus at the time.
Today - after seven months in which forecasts both in and out of the
Treasury have become more gloomy - the general expectation in the City is
that the economy will contract by about 0.8 per cent this year with growth
of 1.3 per cent pencilled in for next year.
However, after taking care of the Budget growth forecasts, Mr Lamont and his
senior advisers stumbled on a new obstacle.
It concerned the PSBR, which in recent years has risen rapidly, partly as a
result of high social security spending and reduced tax income because of
the recession.
Under the initial projections worked out by Treasury economists, the PSBR in
1992-93 would rise to more than Pounds 32bn, with deficits kept at high
levels in each of the following five financial years.
When the economists read Mr Lamont's note - sent on his behalf by Mr Jeremy
Heywood, his principal private secretary - they tried to stick to his
request for a zero deficit by 1996-97.
It was left to a small group in Mr Riley's team to try to come up with the
numbers. They attempted to adjust projections for public spending downwards
and those for government revenues upwards, to come up with relatively small
numbers for the PSBR for the years ahead.
However, as they burned the midnight oil, the economists found they could
not bring the PSBR down to nil without making it obvious to the financial
markets that the numbers had been rigged. That was because of the way that
the spending and income figures would have become implau-sible.
They therefore struck a compromise in which the PSBR projection for 1996-97
was set in the Budget statement at Pounds 6bn, above Mr Lamont's target but
substantially less than the figure of about Pounds 16bn that had been
pencilled in originally. Other numbers for the profile of the PSBR were
reduced in a similar fashion.
As they changed the numbers, the Treasury economists appeared to approach
the exercise with grim relish. 'You have to hand it to the Treasury
economists,' said one person close to the department. 'Lots of people fiddle
numbers but the Treasury does it in a particularly professional way.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / Trafalgar chief to cede control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Nigel Broackes is to relinquish control of Trafalgar House, the
property, construction and shipping group.
Sir Nigel, who founded the group more than 30 years ago, is to step down as
chairman and become life president. This is expected to be an honorary
consultancy post without an automatic seat on the board.
The move is part of a series of managerial changes at the group, which has
thwarted an attempt by Hongkong Land to increase its stake substantially.
Sir Eric Parker is to step down as chief executive in favour of Mr Allan
Gormly, head of the engineering division.
Mr Alan Clements, the senior of the group's three non-executive directors,
has drawn up a list of outside candidates to take over as chairman.
Although the non executives, who include Mr David Howell, a senior
Conservative MP, and Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA Group, helped draw up the
boardroom changes some time ago, they decided against approaching any
potential successor to Sir Nigel when Hongkong Land took 14.9 per cent of
Trafalgar.
The colony's leading property group will today confirm its failure to
increase its stake in the tender offer by more than 1 per cent.
Nonetheless, one of Trafalgar's financial advisers yesterday said the group
would consider a request from Hongkong Land to have boardroom
representation.
Trafalgar's managerial changes will be discussed with Hongkong Land after
Trafalgar's board meeting today.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land and Mr Henry Keswick, chairman
of Jardine Matheson, which controls a third of Hongkong Land, are keen to
discuss Trafalgar's changes. Hongkong Land's agenda includes a significant
say in the group's strategy.

FT  12 OCT 92 / FBI to investigate Iraqi loans: Allegations of misconduct
over US intelligence reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe into possible
misconduct by senior Bush administration officials.
The investigation follows admissions that US intelligence information about
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) of militarily useful loans to Iraq was
deliberately concealed from a federal court.
These loans, made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro, have been at the centre of a long-running scandal in which the Bush
administration has been accused in Congress of covering up its own knowledge
and involvement in the illegal financial transactions.
Late last week Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Justice
officials admitted in closed Senate testimony that intelligence reports on
BNL had been withheld from a US court.
The FBI probe, requested by Mr William Barr, the US attorney-general, came
as officials of the CIA and Department of Justice engaged in an unusual
slanging match about which agency had acted to withhold CIA reports from
Judge Marvin Shoob, the federal judge who has presided over the BNL case.
Mr Dan Levin, a Justice Department spokesman, said the FBI would investigate
whether information had been withheld and whether there had been any
misconduct by senior Bush administration officials.
A substantial part of the BNL loans, including some that were guaranteed by
the US government, financed Iraqi nuclear, chemical weapons and ballistic
missile projects.
Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, said last week
that a special prosecutor should be named to investigate the BNL case.
Senator David Boren, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said at
the weekend that testimony from CIA and Justice Department officials had
created 'very troubling' signs that both government agencies knew that a CIA
report on BNL issued last month was misleading.
The report examined whether the agency had any knowledge of the involvement
of BNL's head office in Rome. It claimed that the CIA had only heard of
Rome's involvement from 'publicly available sources'.
However, the report was immediately contradicted by the disclosure in
Congress of another classified CIA report.
Both the CIA and Justice Department yesterday denied their officials had
deliberately misled Congress or the court. But a Senate official who was
present during the testimony confirmed these admissions were made.
Mr Robert Mueller, the assistant attorney-general, acknowledged that he had
personally rejected an attempt by the CIA to issue a clarifying statement.
'The reason why I did not believe it should be published was that it did not
resolve the conflict between the conclusion of the underlying (CIA) summary
and the document on which it was purportedly based.'
Mr Mueller said that while he tried to resolve the discrepancy, 'I never got
an adequate response from the CIA.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / Lamont faces tough economic probe from MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor of the exchequer, today faces tough
questioning by MPs on his economic strategy against the backdrop of the
steepest decline in British business confidence in three years.
As the chancellor prepared for his cross examination at a televised session
of the Commons' Treasury Committee, Dun and Bradstreet International
published the first analysis of business confidence since sterling was
suspended from the European exchange rate mechanism four weeks ago.
The survey showed that six out of 10 companies expect no upturn in sales in
the final quarter of this year, while 39 per cent expect sales to decrease.
It coincided with a survey by the Confederation of British Industry and
Coopers &amp; Lybrand which revealed deepening pessimism among financial
services companies. Banks, building societies and stockbrokers saw business
volumes dwindle between July and September of this year.
Evidence of a renewed downturn in the UK economy has also led to calls for
the chancellor to signal another cut in UK base rates, currently at 9 per
cent, to boost recovery.
There is growing speculation that a cut in UK rates could come as early as
this week following sterling's rise by nearly 15 pfennigs against the D-Mark
in the past seven days. The pound's recovery to a close of DM2.52 in New
York on Friday night may relieve the government of the need to support the
currency through high interest rates in an attempt to control inflation.
The issue of Pounds 800m of five-year government bonds on Friday compounded
talk of a near-term rate cut. The issue of shorter-dated gilts has heralded
base rate cuts in the past. Ministers may also believe the pressure to ease
monetary policy will intensify later this week if fresh economic data
highlight a deteriorating landscape in UK industry.
On Wednesday, industrial production figures for August are due to be
released, with some economists expecting a fall of 0.2 per cent. Thursday's
unemployment figures for September will be awaited with particular anxiety
by the cabinet, with some analysts projecting a monthly rise in those out of
work in the region of 50,000.
Compounding the gloom is the prospect that up to 25,000 mining jobs could
eventually be lost if British Coal goes ahead with a pre-privatisation pit
closure programme due to be finalised this week, along with thousands of
jobs in related industries. There are suggestions that 30 of the 50
collieries are due to close to clear the way for privatisation.
The surveys on business confidence follow a report from Halifax building
society last week, which showed a 3.1 per cent fall in house prices in
September.
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Warburg Securities, said the picture
presented by these reports was extremely gloomy. 'It may be that we are
entering a period of new economic weakness,' he said, 'with the economy no
longer just bumping along the bottom, but moving downwards once again.'
A report out today from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, shows the government
faces hard choices on whether or not to cut base rates. Using a Treasury
model of the economy, Ernst &amp; Young calculated that a cut in base rates to
6.5 per cent by the middle of 1993 would lead to a rise in gross domestic
product in 1993 by 1.8 per cent.
However, inflation would jump outside the government's declared target of
1-4 per cent, rising to an annual level of 5.7 per cent in 1994.
Alternatively, if rates are cut by no more than one point next year,
inflation will peak at 4 per cent in 1993, but unemployment will rise to
3.6m in 1994.

FT  12 OCT 92 / French threaten summit boycott in trade row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE has threatened to boy-cott this week's emergency European Community
summit in Birmingham if the EC makes concessions to the US on subsidised
farm trade in negotiations which opened in Brussels yesterday.
The French threat risks derailing the finely balanced talks which are widely
seen as the last chance this year to settle a two-year farm trade dispute
which has stalled plans - the so-called Gatt Uruguay Round - to liberalise
world trade.
Last night, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said no progress
had been made at Brussels. 'We are much too far from the goal,' he said,
adding that France wanted an accord 'but not to the detriment of its vital
interests'.
EC officials were told last week that French president Francois Mitterrand
would refuse to attend the Birmingham summit if he was put under pressure to
endorse concessions in the Uruguay Round that were unacceptable to his
government.
The message was delivered by Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the French farm
minister, during talks in Brussels with Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, and Mr Frans Andriessen, the Dutch commissioner
responsible for external affairs. Mr Soisson also warned of a farmers'
revolt if new concessions were made, according to several EC officials.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, offered France assurances
before yesterday's meeting that any agreement would require consensus within
the Community, although Paris technically cannot veto a deal. 'It is not a
matter of out-voting the French,' he said. Until today's resumption of the
talks - which could continue tomorrow - both sides are saying nothing on the
detail of the negotiations.
An official said: 'Everyone is very conscious of the situation in France at
the moment. The French farm minister has been making it plain in Brussels
how difficult it is going to be to achieve support in France for the kind of
Uruguay Round deal that negotiators are currently talking about.'
A French boycott of Birmingham would sink hopes of presenting a much-needed
display of EC unity.
French fears have risen in response to signals that President George Bush is
anxious to seal a deal in order to bolster his re-election campaign.
Likewise, US farm lobbies last week warned that the administration was on
the brink of a 'sell-out'.
Yesterday's Brussels talks, held amid very tight secrecy. involved Mrs Carla
Hills, special US trade representative, Mr Andriessen, Mr MacSharry, and Mr
Ed Madigan, the US agriculture secretary.
First to meet were Mrs Hills and Mr Andriessen. Apart from farm trade, it
was expected that they would discuss obstacles to settlement of the Uruguay
Round - principally disputes over multilateral tariff cuts and
liberalisation of world trade in services.
France is Europe's leading ex-porter both of services and farm products. It
had been hoped that French negotiators could be persuaded to accept
concessions on subsidised food exports - its farm trade accounts for just
3.2 per cent of its GDP - in return for significant gains in services.
But French officials say they have little flexibility in the light of the
powerful No vote by French farmers on Maastricht.
Progress on farm talks has been blocked on two critical issues:
The EC's refusal to accept a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised
farm exports in addition to a 36 per cent cut in their value.
EC insistence that compensation to European farmers for price cuts agreed in
May's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy should not be regarded as
subsidies. The proposed Uruguay Round agreement demands a 20 per cent cut in
domestic farm subsidies over six years.
EC negotiators will be pressing for a smaller volume cut - a figure of 21
per cent has been mentioned - and for 'aggregation', which would allow the
EC to make smaller cuts in sensitive areas, counterbalanced by deeper cuts
elsewhere.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Treasury put gloss on projections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT told Treasury economists to put a more favourable gloss on
official projections for the UK's growing public sector deficit, published a
month before the April general election.
In an internal note, the chancellor told officials to recalculate their
projections for the public sector borrowing requirement in the five years to
1996-97, to reduce them, if possible, to zero by the end of the period.
This led the Treasury to publish projections for the cumulative deficits in
the three years to 1996-97 that were roughly Pounds 30bn below the original
figures worked out internally.
Mr Lamont's initiative was designed to ensure that the Budget statement
published in March, which also contained the latest Treasury forecasts,
would not include figures about government deficits that would unsettle
financial markets and the public.
Details of the manoeuvrings will intensify pressure on Mr Lamont to clarify
the degree to which Treasury economists provide analysis free from political
pressures.
Mr Lamont's future is in some doubt after the pound's suspension from the
exchange rate mechanism and his lacklustre reception at last week's Tory
conference.
Seven months after Mr Lamont moved to cut the Treasury's PSBR projections,
he is attempting to trim back next year's public spending because of renewed
fears over rising state borrowing triggered by the recession.
The chancellor put pressure on his officials in a note drafted about a week
before the Budget statement on March 10.
The note was sent on Mr Lamont's behalf by Mr Jeremy Heywood, his principal
private secretary.
After Mr Lamont's request, the Treasury settled for a compromise, in which
the PSBR projection for 1996-97 was set in the Budget statement at Pounds
6bn, above Mr Lamont's zero target but less than the initial estimate of
Pounds 16bn.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Trafalgar House chairman to give up control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Nigel Broackes is to relinquish control of Trafalgar House, the
property, construction and shipping group.
Sir Nigel, who founded the group more than 30 years ago, is to step down as
chairman and become life president. This is expected to be an honorary
consultancy post without an automatic seat on the board.
The move is part of a series of managerial changes at the group, which has
thwarted an attempt by Hongkong Land to increase its stake substantially.
Sir Eric Parker is to step down as chief executive in favour of Mr Allan
Gormly, head of the engineering division.
Mr Alan Clements, the senior of the group's three non-executive directors,
has drawn up a list of outside candidates to take over as chairman.
Although the non executives, who include Mr David Howell, a senior
Conservative MP, and Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA Group, helped draw up the
boardroom changes some time ago, they decided against approaching any
potential successor to Sir Nigel when Hongkong Land took 14.9 per cent of
Trafalgar.
The colony's leading property group will today confirm its failure to
increase its stake in the tender offer by more than 1 per cent. Nonetheless,
one of Trafalgar's financial advisers yesterday said the group would
consider a request from Hongkong Land to have boardroom representation.
Trafalgar's managerial changes will be discussed with Hongkong Land after
Trafalgar's board meeting today.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land and Mr Henry Keswick, chairman
of JardineMatheson, which controls a third of Hongkong Land, are keen to
discuss Trafalgar's changes. Hongkong Land's agenda includes a significant
say in the group's strategy.
A senior Trafalgar executive said: 'As long as the Keswicks accept they are
a minority shareholder and that the company has to look after the interests
of all its shareholders we may look sympathetically on their request for
boardroom representation.'

<TEXT>
The Israeli government, worried that a surge of unrest in the occupied
territories might derail Middle East peace talks, yesterday warned
Palestinians that Israeli troops would use all their strength to suppress
unrest in the occupied territories.
'The Palestinians must understand that the solution to their problems will
be around the negotiating table, not in the streets and alleyways of the
territories,' Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said during a visit to the Gaza
Strip. Troops would use 'all our strength' to suppress Palestinian unrest.
At least two Palestinians, one a boy aged 14 and an Israeli settler, were
killed over the weekend, and more than 100 injured in the West Bank and
Gaza. The clashes with security forces are similar to the widespread rioting
which characterised the early days of the near-five-year-old intifada, or
uprising, against Israeli rule.
The demonstrations erupted in support of a hunger strike staged by many of
the 12,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, protesting at
conditions in the prisons.
Mr Rabin said he was ready to improve conditions. But Israeli officials
accused opponents and supporters of the peace talks on the Palestinian side
of exploiting the protest. They said opponents wanted to disrupt the
year-old negotiations, which are due to resume in Washington on October 21,
while supporters were trying to put pressure on Israel.
The authorities are afraid of a sustained resurgence of the intifada. 'We
are worried,' said a Rabin aide. 'This can undermine the whole peace
process.'
The unrest reflected frustration in the occupied territories that the talks
have so far produced nothing tangible.
One Palestinian lawyer said: 'Feelings are running very strong on the prison
issue because almost everyone has a family member in jail. The street has
taken over again; our peace negotiators cannot control it.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / Serb referendum holds key to republic's power struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERBS yesterday voted in a referendum on whether to hold early elections -
the outcome of which will play an important role in determining whether
United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia will be lifted.
Confusion yesterday appeared to grip Belgrade, the Serbian capital, because
many people were uncertain whether to vote in the snap referendum called by
Serbia's ruling Socialists under the control of Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic.
Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav federal prime minister, and Mr Dobrica Cosic,
the president of Yugoslavia, both favour early elections to get rid of Mr
Milosevic, who is seen by the international community as most responsible
for the war in Bosnia.
Yesterday Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, and peace
negotiators Mrs Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen said in Moscow that UN sanctions
could be lifted if Mr Panic gained the upper hand against hardline Serbs.
They also indicated sanctions might be eased to help people survive the
winter.
If the referendum fails, Mr Milosevic could remain in office for three more
years. It would be a blow to Mr Panic and Mr Cosic who have pledged to get
UN sanctions lifted and democratise Serbia.
The Socialists called the referendum in the belief it would fail and enable
them to remain in power at a time when the Serbian economy is collapsing
under the strain of war and sanctions, which include an oil embargo. The
rules require a majority of registered voters to vote Yes. It was unlikely
more than 3.5m people would vote Yes after Serbian television, under Mr
Milosevic's control, had denied publicity to the referendum.
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 per cent of the 2.1m population of the
southern province of Kosovo, yesterday ignored the ballot, heeding a boycott
of Serbian institutions ordered by pro-independence Albanian leaders. Some
of Serbia's fragmented and weak opposition leaders also called for a
boycott.
Turnout was reported to be moderate. Results are due to be announced
tomorrow. Some 400,000 refugees, emigres and Serbs in former Yugoslav
republics are eligible to vote.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Bush and Clinton stand their ground in TV debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton fought each other to a
reasonably civilised stand-off in their first televised debate of the US
presidential election last night.
Neither the Republican nor the Democratic contender committed an obvious,
egregious mistake in the first of their three confrontations over the next
eight days. Both were well prepared and, if Mr Bush appeared initially the
more relaxed, Mr Clinton warmed to his task. Mr Ross Perot, the independent
candidate, generated the most applause and laughter with his epigrammatic
interventions at the debate in St Louis, Missouri.
The closest the debate came to fireworks was early on when the president
insisted that Mr Clinton was wrong to have participated in demonstrations
against the Vietnam war while a student at Oxford. 'I couldn't do that and I
don't think most Americans could,' Mr Bush said.
Mr Clinton responded by comparing the president's attacks on his patriotism
to the tactics of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. He cited Mr
Bush's father, Prescott Bush, at the time a senator from Connecticut, as a
man who had spoken out against McCarthyism.
Mr Bush's frequently repeated theme was one of optimism. He said more than
once that 'America is not coming apart at the seams', as he said Mr Clinton
consistently implied, and that the US was 'still the envy of the world'.
He emphasised in his closing statement that experience and trust were the
special qualities he brought to the election. Mr Clinton's equally
consistent message was that the time had come for change at home and abroad.
Mr Perot, in perhaps the only intervention of his that might be seen as
helpful to Mr Clinton, said the president was wrong to focus on what his
Democratic opponent had done as a youth.
In one possible surprise, Mr Bush hinted that, if re-elected, he would 'tell
Jim Baker to do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs'. It
had been generally assumed Mr Baker would return to the State Department in
any Bush second term.
Mr Clinton ducked an invitation to attack the Federal Reserve for its
conduct of monetary policy. If he became president, he said, 'I don't have
to worry in the short term about the Fed, their policies seem to me pretty
sound'. It was more important, he argued, 'to use the powers the president
does have' over the economy.
The Democratic candidate probably scored most heavily in his detailed
responses on issues such as health care, the need for racial harmony and a
proper understanding of the problems of contemporary families.
The first instant reaction came from an ABC TV poll, which found that 27 per
cent thought Mr Clinton had won, 22 per cent Mr Perot and 18 per cent Mr
Bush, with the rest undecided. Asked for their presidential preferences,
compared to the previous poll, Mr Clinton went up one point to 46 per cent,
Mr Bush down 4 points to 31 per cent and Mr Perot up 7 points to 15 per
cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The legal profession is finally realising how remiss it has been in tackling
discrimination against women practitioners - and not before time. If the
profession has been even more neglectful about its attitude to ethnic
minorities, its indifference to female contribution to the law is infinitely
of longer standing.
The Law Society's publication last week of a consultative document on new
anti-discriminatory measures is designed to alert the profession to the
importance which it must attach to the question of discrimination.
Significantly, the governing body of solicitors wishes to elevate its
current guidelines on non-discriminatory policies and practices to the
status of rules enforceable through the profession's disciplinary code. The
existing principle of non-discrimination should, it states, be extended to
impose a policy on solicitors which will be directed specifically at
eliminating discrimination. This would focus on current practices on
recruitment and career advancement.
The nature of discrimination against women differs significantly from
discrimination against members of the ethnic minorities. Whereas blacks and
Asians appear to suffer very serious discrimination at the point of
recruitment as trainee solicitors, women encounter disadvantages later in
their careers; this is most common following temporary withdrawal from
practice because of pregnancy.
More worrying still is the comparative failure of women solicitors to become
partners. Some of the large firms of solicitors still do not possess a
female partner. There is considerable statistical evidence suggesting that
while women do achieve partnerships, they only do so at a significantly
slower rate than their male counterparts. Other evidence, not all anecdotal,
reveals that women interviewed for partnerships are often asked improper
questions on their marital prospects and whether they intend to start a
family.
Similar experiences from women who seek to practice at the Bar have long
been a source of justified criticism of the profession.
Barrister Helena Kennedy's recently published book entitled Eve was Framed
is testimony to what she proclaims is the treatment of women as 'a paradigm
of the faults and blindnesses of the legal system'.
In an earlier work, published in 1978, Ms Kennedy wrote, that 'nothing of
any significance has been done to counter discrimination against women, and
as a result women are playing little or no part in the creation and
interpretation of laws affecting men and women alike'.
Discrimination against women over the years has been a tent peg to secure
the status quo ante. It is as powerful as a legal precedent in inhibiting
change. The present movement to rid the profession of its discriminatory
habits is healthy enough but the legacy of the past leaves a mark on the
contemporary legal scene.
The first woman barrister was appointed in 1922; the first woman solicitor
also qualified in the same year. It took another 40 years before a woman
became a county court judge; three years later the first woman made it to
the High Court bench.
But that was hardly the herald of a new era. Only five more women have since
been appointed as High Court judges. No woman has yet become a law lord and
out of a complement of 27 judges on the Court of Appeal there is only one
woman. Of some 90 High Court judges only three are women.
Judges are appointed mainly from among the leading barristers. Out of 628
practising Queen's Counsel only 29 (4 per cent) are female. In spite of this
comparative paucity of women barristers from whom to select today's
judiciary there is a case for positive discrimination by the Lord
Chancellor.
Equally pressing for the profession is its treatment of people from the
ethnic minorities. Last week's consultative document also laid down
proposals for new measures to deal with racial discrimination.
The Law Society took its first steps to tackle racial discrimination in 1988
when it introduced a code of practice to address increasing evidence that
black students were finding it more difficult than their white counterparts
to secure articles (training with a firm of solicitors).
At the same time, black barristers complained that white solicitors were
declining to brief them. Black barristers' reliance on work from black and
Asian solicitors was in danger of establishing a form of professional
apartheid; and that is what, in effect, happened with the establishment of a
Society of Black Lawyers.
Since then the number of complaints has not diminished. Last year the Law
Society received 85 allegations of racial discrimination from students. The
Society of Black Lawyers' recently published report based on a survey of its
members supports these findings.
An industrial tribunal recently found a firm of solicitors guilty of
discrimination on racial grounds against an applicant who wanted to become a
trainee solicitor. The tribunal criticised the firm's selection procedures
for trainees; the tribunal also indicated how a firm could unintentionally
infringe race relations laws.
The Law Society now proposes to reinforce its code by developing equal
opportunities policies. The proposals realistically recognise that racial
discrimination cannot be instantly eliminated. But if appropriately
implemented the new measures should reassure ethnic minorities that they -
like their female colleagues - are not being neglected in the ultimate
search for proper representation in the provision of legal services.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Michael Prowse on America: Clinton and the new Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Governor Bill Clinton still well ahead in opinion polls, the US seems
to be heading for a new era of government activism. Mr Clinton has
repeatedly asserted his belief in the public sector as a positive force in
people's lives. He is also hyper-active by temperament: 'unless he achieves
at least 20 things each day as president,' says one adviser, 'he will not go
to bed happy.' The prospect of an energetic 'do-gooder' in the Oval Office
will alarm those who believe that governments mostly do harm; it suggests a
regression to the 1960s and the 'Great Society' social programmes championed
by Lyndon Johnson.
Such fears are probably exaggerated. Mr Clinton would be an activist
president. But his conception of government's role seems to be enlightened.
Following the heavy defeat of Mr Walter Mondale, the old-style Democrat who
challenged incumbent President Ronald Reagan in 1984, a small band of
frustrated Democrats formed the Democratic Leadership Council to shift the
Democratic party into the political mainstream and develop a 'post-liberal'
governing agenda.
Mr Clinton, then an obscure state governor, supported the DLC during its
difficult early days as a southern/western insurgency movement on the
conservative fringes of the party. From 1990 up to his bid for the
presidency, he chaired the council.
To find out more about the DLC's philosophy, I went to see Mr Will Marshall,
a former journalist who helped start the movement and now runs the
Progressive Policy Institute, the council's think-tank. He explained that
the institute was set up following the defeat of Mr Michael Dukakis, the
Democratic presidential candidate in 1988 and was modelled on conservative
think-tanks, such as the Heritage Foundation, which successfully laid the
ground for Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980.
In what ways has the DLC and the institute tried to change traditional
Democratic thinking? Mr Marshall rattles off examples. They have stressed
the importance of pro-market policies to stimulate growth, arguing that a
preoccupation with redistribution makes little sense when the overall pie is
no longer growing much. Equally important, they have advocated far-reaching
reform of the public sector, advocating 'entrepreneurial government' in
place of old-style bureaucracies. Mr David Osborne, an institute fellow, was
co-author of Reinventing Government, an influential book that advocates a
Thatcherite cocktail of deregulation, privatisation and enhanced customer
choice.
These 'new democrats' have been innovative in other spheres. The DLC has
been at the centre of a movement to redefine the relationship between
government and citizens by stressing that rights entail reciprocal
responsibilities. The group believes, for example, that welfare payments are
justified only if recipients accept training or jobs. On race, Mr Marshall,
a southerner, argues for equal opportunity rather than equal outcomes and
opposes old-style affirmative action as discriminatory. Finally, on foreign
policy, the DLC has sought to reverse the public perception of the
Democratic party as soft on defence, arguing that the US can promote
principles it believes in, such as democracy, only from a position of
strength.
In Britain, wet Tories and the social democratic wing of the Labour party
would both be comfortable with most of the DLC's policy positions. This
would not surprise Mr Marshall who regards himself as pursuing a 'third
way', which is neither right nor left. He claims an affinity of views with
many on the progressive wing of the Republican party, including, for
example, Mr Lamar Alexander,the education secretary, who is promoting
'school choice', and Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary and proponent of
urban 'empowerment' and enterprise zones. He jokes, however, that it will be
a Democratic administration that actually implements many of their pet
schemes.
It is hard to doubt either Mr Marshall's sincerity or the merits of many of
his progressive policies. The depth of Mr Clinton's personal commitment to
the 'post-liberal' agenda, however, remains untested. If he is elected,
traditional Democratic constituencies, such as organised labour, will lose
no time in pressing their sectional interests. A young inexperienced
president could easily lose his way.
Worse still, Mr Clinton is a skilled enough politician to have used the DLC
as a political springboard without really believing in its policies. The DLC
has been useful to him in many practical ways, from locating fund raisers to
providing crucial cells of support in many states.
Mr Marshall's gut feeling, however, is that Mr Clinton is fully committed to
the reformist agenda. In his acceptance speech at the New York convention,
Mr Clinton could have pandered to party activists, but instead delivered a
ringing restatement of core DLC beliefs. At subsequent testing moments, he
has remained solid: for example, he recently endorsed the free trade pact
with Mexico despite union misgivings. Optimism about the US is currently
unfashionable; but I cannot help thinking that the nation may have found a
man and a set of policies capable of addressing its many pressing social and
economic problems. The days of domestic drift could be numbered.

FT  12 OCT 92 / The Monday Interview: Enduring symbol of stability - Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, talks to Robert Graham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a country where intrusive journalism thrives, one institution and one
figure have remained above the fray - the Bank of Italy and its governor
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
The mystique, close to reverence, surrounding the bank and its 71-year-old
governor endures in spite of Italy's bruising experience on the currency
markets in recent weeks. The lira was forced to devalue by 7 per cent on
September 13 and four days later to begin floating outside the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM).
Mr Ciampi was the leading advocate of the 'strong lira' policy, which placed
the currency within the narrow fluctuation band of the ERM. But this policy
was based on the premise that Italy had to put its public finances in order.
The governor has emerged from the crisis with his prestige intact because he
has been powerless to control fiscal policy, as he has never ceased to
remind the politicians during his 13 years as governor.
His speech at the bank's annual meeting in May now looks prophetic. Urgent
measures, he said, had to be taken within 'a matter of weeks' to keep the
lira stable within the ERM.
With the studied caution of an intensely private person Mr Ciampi says: 'The
crisis that emerged last month could have been avoided if the member states
had grasped the opportunity provided by the German-Italian proposal of
September 12 for a general realignment - within the bounds set by an
appreciation of the D-Mark and equal depreciation of the lira, coupled with
a decrease in interest rates in Germany.
'Unfortunately the realignment was limited to the lira/D-Mark exchange rate,
so that the accompanying reduction in German rates was only small. This left
plenty of scope for the markets to mount further speculative attacks against
other currencies.'
This is not simply wisdom with hindsight. In private Mr Ciampi scarcely
conceals a great sense of disappointment, even bitterness, that an
opportunity was missed and for which both Italy and other members such as
Britain paid dearly.
On the weekend of September 12-13 Italy and Germany were the sole countries
to discuss realignments in face-to-face meetings, he points out. Discussions
with other members were done over the telephone, which, Mr Ciampi says, was
not the best way of breaking down the resistance of other European Community
members to a more general realignment.
The Italians also pressed in vain for a convening of the EC's monetary
committee during that weekend, although by the following Wednesday the
committee was convened at even shorter notice to endorse the suspension of
sterling and the lira from the ERM.
Mr Ciampi is convinced that the Bundesbank would have reduced interests
rates by more than a quarter of a percentage point on September 14 if the
realignment had not been limited to Italy's devaluation. Indeed, he knows
German culture well, having studied German literature at university at Pisa
and having established a close relationship with Karl Otto Pohl, the former
Bundesbank president.
The governor does not advocate significant changes in the ERM to resolve the
problems that have emerged recently. 'The crisis is not the result of
shortcomings in the system, but rather of the unwillingness of countries to
implement - as the rules actually require - closer and more effective
economic and monetary co-ordination.' In other words it is the application
of the rules which has been faulty.
Recent events have not undermined the Maastricht treaty, he argues. Indeed,
they have only cast doubt on its 'gradualist' timetable towards European
union. 'The crisis has clearly revealed the difficulty of maintaining
orderly conditions for five or seven years during the advance towards the
third stage of monetary union. The process needs to be accelerated (towards
an institutional arrangement with a single monetary policy).'
Mr Ciampi is an ardent supporter of closer European integration and believes
Italy has to be fully part of this process; hence Italy's commitment to
re-enter the ERM as soon as possible. To achieve this he turns to the
politicians, saying budget proposals to tackle the huge public sector
deficit must be approved and 'resolutely implemented'.
But here he finds himself and the bank in a curious position. The Bank of
Italy, through its carefully guarded independent status, can take decisions
in monetary policy and foreign exchange matters. The government, however, is
hampered by a cumbersome bureaucracy and a fragmented political process
which creates long delays before fiscal policies are implemented. The
government's difficulties in enacting a 1993 budget, which may take until
the end of November to approve, are creating considerable uncertainty in the
markets.
Mr Ciampi is one of the main proponents of a European Community stand-by
loan to sustain international confidence in the Italian economy and help
repay loans extended by the Bundesbank to support the lira. The proposal is
now under discussion.
Despite the depletion of reserves, he insists that Italy is in a position to
honour all its obligations contracted with the Bundesbank and the Belgian
central bank during recent weeks. And he is adamant that Italy's gold
reserves will not be touched.
In making such assurances, there can be no doubt that Mr Ciampi has past
experience to draw on, having seen 11 devaluations of the lira during his
tenure as governor. 'The moments of greatest tension in the markets have
passed,' he says.
He started out life intending to be a naval officer, a natural profession
for someone born in the port of Livorno. Though he was invalided out of the
service because of problems with his eyes, he smatters his conversation with
nautical metaphors and sounds very much like a naval officer in describing
his philosophy:
'It is necessary to hold steady, avoid over-hasty decisions and provide the
liquidity (to the financial system) that is required while pursuing a
rigorous monetary policy.' But he is well aware that this will not be enough
to satisfy the financial markets and reassure investors.
'It is crucial that uncertainty and doubt be eliminated; investors' fears
that constraints will be imposed on government securities are out of place,
as is concern that the freedom of capital movement will be restricted. The
public debt will continue to be managed according to the rules of the free
market.'
Mr Ciampi will not be drawn on what sort of parity the lira might re-enter
the ERM or the precise timing of such a move. But he says: 'The depreciation
of the lira that has occurred in the absence of ERM obligations is far in
excess of any reasonable estimate of the need to improve the price
competitiveness of Italian industry.'
By the end of last week the markets bore out this view of the overshoot in
the floating rate, with the lira recovering to L880 against the D-Mark,
compared with L1,000 in earlier trading.
Devaluations, Mr Ciampi says, rarely solve problems; rather they underline
the previous failure to solve them and make their resolution even more
urgent. This is a message he hopes will be understood by the politicians.
His relations with the government of Mr Giuliano Amato are good, and there
is agreement on where the dividing line lies between political
decision-making and the role of the bank. This has been important in
co-ordinating positions over the past month since ultimately the decision
for Italy to realign was a political one. So too will be the decision on ERM
re-entry.
Such co-ordination was not always evident, notably with the previous
government of Mr Giulio Andreotti - the governor and the former prime
minister did not meet formally to discuss bank business for two years.
Mr Ciampi is now beyond normal retiring age, and indeed has waived his
salary and merely draws his pension. He claims he is ready to go whenever
necessary, handing over a ship in perfect working order. But he has become
such a symbol of institutional solidity that it is hard to see when such an
opportunity will arise. It would be surprising if he was not in office when
the Bank of Italy celebrates its centenary next year.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Volatility continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were wild swings in the exchange rates for the dollar, sterling and
the Italian lira against the D-Mark last week and there may be further
volatility in forthcoming days, writes James Blitz.
Attention will focus on the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, with a
strong expectation that the German central bank will cut its official rates
after recent easing in its money market operations. However, many analysts
believe that the the next figure for German M3 money supply will be in
double figures and that an easing in rates is unlikely until Christmas.
The uncertainty over the differential between German and US rates hangs over
the dollar, sterling and the lira. The US did not ease interest rates last
week, as had been expected, and the dollar rallied 8 pfennigs to a close of
DM1.4880 in New York on Friday. Uncertainty over the November 3 Presidential
election probably gives the dollar a limited upside.
On Friday, the Italian lira closed at L874.4 to the D-Mark, 12 per cent
higher than its low on Monday afternoon. But the near term outlook for the
currency depends on the passing of the 1993 budget, which involves deficit
cuts of 93 trillion lire. There will doubtless be periods of currency
weakness until credibility is re-established.
Sterling, which is also floating freely outside the European exchange rate
mechanism, will be affected by the UK chancellor's appearance before a
select committee of the House of Commons today, in which he could further
outline the UK government's economic policy. Wednesday's industrial
production number for August and Thursday's figure for September
unemployment will illustrate the scale of the UK recession.

FT  12 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: The down-sizing of Great
Britain Plc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEXED bonds are the investment flavour of the month. They may look boring,
but they have one great merit: they offer all-risks anti-Tory insurance. If
our future is to be slump, real interest rates will fall; if we get the
traditional inflationary dash for growth, investors are still covered. There
is even a bonus: as indexed issues pile up, the market is at last gaining
real liquidity. This alone may help to drive yields down further. Indexed
will be a bad choice only if we can expect an ordinary cyclical recovery.
This seems at best an outside chance, because in Brighton last week the
Tories lived fully up to their old name - the stupid party. Patriotism,
clearly, is the last refuge not only of scoundrels, but of fools. We were
left with foreign policy of sulking our way into Europe, an economic policy
of blind faith in men of proved poor judgment, and a government not only
facing recession, as most are, but with not the ghost of an idea of what to
do about it. On the contrary, it seems bent on making a bad situation worse.
One example must suffice: the apparent decision, in the name of public
expenditure control, not to build a Jubilee Line extension to Docklands.
This will have an effect not only on the PSBR, but on the banks, which will
have to make further large provisions against their Docklands book. This
loss of capital can only be met by further attempts to down-size bank
balance sheets: by calling in loans, and refusing new ones, and by squeezing
surviving borrowers for more revenue.
These are the very actions which have already produced the worst downturn
for a generation. Has any official warned ministers about this? From the
Bank, very possibly; but from the treasury, probably not. There has been no
signxyet in what ministers say, or more significantly in what they do, that
they understand the financial forces which drive debt deflation. The Fed
knows about them, and so do the Japanese and Australians; but not Mr Major
and his backward-walking crew.
The one implied hope that was left was that sterling devaluation would
enable the UK to enjoy more than its share of a recovery initiated by wiser
policies in other countries. But this seems unlikely. The only big reflation
is planned in Japan; but Japanese demand for imports is so low this will
have little impact. So far as the UK is concerned, fiscal deflation in
Germany, Italy, and Sweden, with its depressing impact in neighbouring
countries, will more than outweigh whatever Tokyo may do.
This leaves the US. Assuming that Governor Clinton does nothing disastrous,
a change of regime and of policies can be expected there. The new policies
will include a public investment stimulus on New Deal lines, which is
possible because the US fiscal rules, unlike British, allow investment
spending to be counted off-budget. With a friendly Congress, an effective
attack on Washington waste is also possible. This is a promising approach;
and since any real US recovery is also likely to trigger a strong dollar
recovery, the international impact will be truly helpful. Don't rush to buy
equities, though. Investment spending always has a lumbering take-off; and
Mr Clinton's record is that of a cautious man. Wall Street would look
attractive, were it not for the clear risk of a crash between now and
lift-off. London is still caught in a trap of ever-downward expectations.
In London, the only hope lies in interest rates. The anti-inflationary
rhetoric in Brighton makes cuts likelier than not. This is the normal cover
story of those about to relax monetary policy, as Mr Paul Volcker memorably
showed in 1982. His huge interest rate cuts were prefaced by an
anti-inflationary lecture so fierce it frightened the bond markets. But can
any plausible cuts offset the government's determination to deflate at the
bottom of a recession, while resisting the deep devaluation which worked
this trick in 1982? Indexed still look the best sterling bet for the
cautious. For bold pessimists, conventionals.

FT  12 OCT 92 / International Equities: Companies find the gloss has faded
from foreign listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ARE foreign listings going out of fashion? During the 1980s
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
when securities markets were meant to go 'global' - getting a listing abroad
was all the rage.
Investors around the world wanted to buy shares in foreign companies, ran
the theory, so what better way to sell shares to them than list on their
local exchanges?
For many companies, however, this proved expensive and time-consuming. Like
many theories of the globalisation era, experience has shown it to be overly
simplistic. Recent experience suggests the high-water mark of foreign
listings has passed. In London the number of foreign companies seeking a
listing peaked at 84 in 1984, falling to 38 in 1990. Last year there were 20
and this year so far eight.
There is a steady flow of companies delisting, on the other hand. That may
be because of merger or takeover or because the amount of trading did not
live up to the companies' hopes. Whatever the reason, at 533 the number of
overseas listed companies could be past its peak.
This phenomenon is not restricted to London. UK companies are pulling back
from foreign listings. Aegis, a media buying company, last week said it was
giving up its listings in Paris and New York, to save itself Pounds 250,000
a year in compliance costs.
Tokyo, meanwhile, suffered the indignity last month of losing five big
foreign listings, including GM, Philips and News Corp. It is not too hard to
see why these companies' ambitions were frustrated. Most foreign shares are
bought by institutions and these investors generally have access to a
foreign company's domestic market.
The replacement of floor-trading by screens, the greater flow of information
internationally and the advent of broker-dealers with salesforces spanning
the globe means companies no longer have the same need to list on foreign
markets. A second reason is that liquidity has not developed in most
off-shore markets.
It turns out that foreign investors value liquidity, and the chance to trade
at prices determined by domestic investors, more than they value the ability
to trade when domestic markets are shut or the convenience of having foreign
companies sitting alongside domestic ones on local exchanges.
Foreign listings are not about to vanish. They are still used by consumer
product companies and others for marketing reasons, for instance. For
companies wanting to raise money, rather than just create a new market for
their shares, it may be useful to go through the disciplines of complying
with local prospectus requirements.
That is especially true in the US, the world's largest domestic capital
market. Compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and
US accounting practices is a stiff requirement which many companies are
prepared to fulfil - even though there is now a growing private market for
companies which are exempt under Rule 144a.
Unless and until the SEC relaxes its disclosure requirements, this is likely
to remain the case.

FT  12 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Hybrid production from Walt Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROBOND investors were last week offered a new type of debt/equity hybrid,
when Walt Disney, the US entertainment company, launched a bond issue with
interest linked to its film revenues.
More than half the deal is being placed in the US, under a Rule 144A option.
With US interest rates at a low point, US insurance companies, no longer
able to gain double digit coupons even in the junk bond market, are
particularly hungry for the potential yield the structure offers.
However, the deal, which was extensively marketed prior to launch, requires
an understanding of the company not normally required of bond investors.
'If you like the movie part of Disney equity and not the theme park part,
then this offers the right exposure,' said one banker.
The Dollars 400m Eurobond issue of senior participating notes due 1999 pays
interest of 7 1/2 per cent for the first 18 months and 1 1/2 per cent
thereafter. In addition, payments of contingent interest will be made if
film revenues generated by a Dollars 400m portfolio of live action films
exceed Dollars 800m over the life of the notes. Subsequently, eligible
revenues are split with the company, up to a maximum of Dollars 240m
Thus interest payments will fall in a range of 3 per cent to 13 1/2 per
cent, according to Citicorp. The deal is arranged by Citicorp Investment
Bank, with US placement arranged by Lehman Brothers.
Revenue participation is already an established part of film financing.
Loans with profit participation for lenders developed from the traditional
means of financing through limited partnerships. The latest deal is a public
offering of a structured transaction which works on the same principle as
these loans with profit participation.
For Disney, the deal also has a strategic goal. The company is cash rich,
and could use its internal cash flow to finance its films. However, the
structure of the deal - which means that interest costs fall and rise in
line with revenues - will have the effect of smoothing out its earnings
profile. This is desirable since Wall Street marks down shares with a
volatile performance.

FT  12 OCT 92 / US Money and Credit: Uncertainty over fiscal policy induces
caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER an extremely trying week, the US bond market will be hoping that the
traditional calm that accompanies today's Columbus Day holiday - the markets
are open, but the banks are closed and trading is normally subdued - will be
extended for a few more days.
US Treasury investors will also want to think about anything but Federal
Reserve monetary policy after the disappointments of a week which saw what
one Wall Street analyst called a 'wrenching transformation of psychology
about Fed policy'.
Although the final blow to the market's hopes for easier monetary policy was
inflicted by an article in Friday's Financial Times - which said that a
senior Fed official believed there would be no further interest rate cuts
before election day (November 3) - prices had been edging lower and yields
inching higher for most of the week as the excitement surrounding the
monthly meeting of the policy-making open market committee (FOMC) faded.
Given that the market had been bubbling with rate-cut fever since late
September, the apparent final confirmation that monetary policy would not be
changed warranted a big correction in bond prices.
The result was that long-term yields, which had dropped as low as 7.3 per
cent at the start of the month, rocketed up to more than 7.5 per cent as
many of the trades made in anticipation of a rate reduction were unwound in
a hurry. Rates on short-term securities jumped by a similar 20 to 25 basis
points.
The explanation for the decision not to ease centred on the ambiguity of
recent economic statistics, and an argument that the economy was not
sufficiently weak to warrant further monetary stimulus, at least for the
moment.
Another possible explanation put forward by some observers suggested that
the Fed did not want to cut interest rates because it is worried by the
prospect of a Democratic victory in the presidential election. Assuming Mr
Bill Clinton became president, it would not be long before he passed a
potentially deficit-widening fiscal package through a compliant Congress.
The Fed may therefore be wary of cutting interest rates now because the
combination of lower rates and higher spending could prove dangerously
over-stimulative for the economy.
Although it is unlikely that the Fed's policy managers had the image of a
President Clinton on their minds when they made their decision at the FOMC
last week, the question of what a Democratic victory means for the bond
market is one that investors are now beginning to ask themselves.
It is possible that some of the recent fall in bonds can be put down to
investors cautiously pricing into the market the impact of a Clinton
victory. Their main concern is that the Democrat's fiscal policy, in
particular the party's ambitious spending plans, will add to the deficit and
push interest rates higher.
The problem for the market, however, is not that it is scared about what
Clinton might do, but rather that it is scared about all the uncertainty
surrounding what he might do.
Mr Mitchell Held, economist at Smith Barney, says: 'What this uncertainty
translates into is more fodder for the markets to worry about.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / French Government Bonds: Beregovoy in hands of Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF there is one thing that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister,
hates it is being reminded of the extent to which the course of the French
economy is dictated by Germany.
Unfortunately for Mr Beregovoy, the single most important issue on France's
economic agenda - whether and when official interest rates come down - is
firmly in the hands of the Bundesbank. France cannot risk lowering its
interest rates until the Germans do so.
Last week French government bonds staged a slight rally as fears of another
attack on the franc receded and hopes rose that the Bundesbank will reduce
interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bonds
ended the week at 8.53 per cent, against 8.61 per cent a week before. But if
there is the slightest sign of a change in attitude from the Germans, French
bonds could plummet again.
For the moment investors appear optimistic. Mr Francois Systermans, a bond
trader at Paribas in Paris, says: 'The market seems a bit more confident.
Domestic investors are putting their money back into bonds. The UK houses
have stopped selling and are starting to buy again, so are the US investors.
The French market is much more stable.'
But the chief source of this new-found stability is the expectation of a
rate cut by the Germans. This means that French government bonds are still
very vulnerable to the threat of another volte face from the Bundesbank.
Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist with Salomon Brothers, says: 'The market
is still jittery. There has been an improvement in French bonds on
expectations of a reduction in German rates. If there is a reduction in
Germany, France will follow. French bonds will then rise further and the
spread with German bunds should narrow.
'But if the hopes of a cut in German rates are disappointed, we could see a
very different scenario. The market would become nervous about how much
longer France could sustain high real interest rates and stagnant growth.'
In theory the bond market should be bolstered by the underlying strength of
the French economy, which is still performing better than most of its
international competitors. However, the economic outlook is now far less
rosy than it seemed even a few months ago.
The recent stream of lacklustre interim results from France's big industrial
groups has raised concern about growth prospects for the second half. There
are also fears about the impact of the strong franc on French exports next
year.
In the meantime a sharp fall in corporate investment - and in demand for
consumer credit - illustrates the impact of high real interest rates.
Goldman Sachs, already forecasting growth of just 1.5 per cent for France in
1992, rather than the official projection of 2 per cent, has reduced its
growth expectations for 1993 from 1.6 per cent to 0.7 per cent.
The position could worsen if official interest rates remain high and French
banks are forced to pass on the increase in their own credit costs to their
customers, thereby increasing the financial pressure on the corporate sector
and triggering another round of investment cuts.
Such a turn of events could be avoided, of course, if France is able to
lower official interest rates, and that depends on the Bundesbank.
Mr Mercier says: 'All the signs suggest that we should see a reduction in
German and French rates within the next quarter. But we've been saying that
for the past two years.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Gilts: Hopes of interest rate cut spark advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gilt market advanced last week on the back of a stronger pound and
indications that Germany may soon ease credit policy, opening the way for a
reduction in base rates.
With inflationary pressures in the UK likely to stay relatively subdued for
some time as a result of the recession, demand for gilts was strong across
the spectrum of the yield curve, causing a rise in prices of up to one point
on the week.
The gains recorded by both short and long-dated gilts made last week the
healthiest for the market since Black Wednesday on September 16, when the
pound left the exchange rate mechanism.
Yields fell slightly, with the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1997
seeing a fall in yield of about 10 basis points to 8.3 per cent on Friday
night. There was a similar reduction in the yield of the 9 per cent Treasury
stock due in 2012, which had a yield quoted at 9.27 per cent at the end of
the week.
Some of the gains in price for stock of the long-dated variety - demand for
which had been slack in the previous two weeks - reflected the perception by
some investors that the price falls for these bonds had made the securities
something of a bargain.
Helping the recovery in gilt prices was the healthier tone to sterling,
which advanced to more than DM2.50 by Friday night, well up on the levels of
around DM2.40 earlier in the week.
Some of the gains in sterling were the result of a settling of nerves in the
currency markets after the traumas of the pound's devaluation.
Perceptions from Germany that the Bundesbank might be getting ready to ease
credit rates following signs of an increasingly-serious German economic
slow-down helped to push the D-Mark down against sterling as well as other
currencies.
Assuming sterling continues to perform reasonably strongly and the German
central bank cuts rates in the next month or so, the way would probably be
clear for a base rate reduction from 9 per cent to around 8 per cent by the
end of the year, helping gilt prices at the short end of the market.
Expectations that the Bank of England may be preparing the ground for a cut
in base rates strengthened slightly on Friday when the Bank announced it
would issue Pounds 800m of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bonds due in 1997 at a
price of Pounds 102, available from today.
With the Bank's funding needs for this financial year virtually complete,
the Bank had no specific requirement to issue this kind of stock. Since
issuance of such short-dated securities have in the past presaged a
reduction in base rates, some market participants believed the announcement
was another pointer towards an easing in short-term borrowing rates fairly
soon.
The gilts market was little impressed by the announcement by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, of a new inflation target for Britain. Under Mr
Lamont's plan, the Treasury will try and keep underlying inflation - as
measured by the year-on-year rise in the retail prices index, excluding
mortgage payments - at between 1 and 4 per cent. The level of 4 per cent
happens to be what the underlying growth in this measure was in the 12
months to September.
However, several market participants said that Mr Lamont was careful to
provide an escape clause, with the suggestion that the target could be
allowed to be exceeded in the event of unexpected price movements resulting
from changes in the terms of trade - such as might result from a devaluation
in sterling.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Virgin set to pull out of Dan-Air rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between Mr Richard Branson and Dan-Air are expected to reach a
head in the next 48 hours amid signs that another group has emerged as a
potential rescuer for the troubled UK independent carrier owned by Davies &amp;
Newman.
Mr Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways, is understood to have
become increasingly reluctant to enter into a Dan-Air rescue operation
because the airline's financial situation appears to be far worse than Mr
Branson had earlier anticipated. Virgin now seems on the verge of pulling
out of a rescue of Dan-Air.
Earlier City estimates that the group's pre-tax losses this year would total
Pounds 7m-Pounds 10m have now been described as too low.
Mr Branson also appears to consider that any rescue of Dan-Air in
association with Virgin would require a complete restructuring of the
Dan-Air business cutting it back to its profitable core.
There has meanwhile been increasing speculation over the weekend that
another company has expressed interest in Dan-Air.
One suggestion was that British Airways, which ended talks with Dan-Air last
month, had decided to take another look at the Gatwick-based carrier.
BA said yesterday it never commented on this sort of speculation, but City
analysts said it was unlikely the UK flag-carrier would be interested in
reviving talks.
However, the same analysts suggested that one company possibly interested in
forging an alliance with Dan-Air was the German group LTU, which bought the
Thomas Cook travel chain last summer.
LTU, which is understood to be looking for investment opportunities in
Britain, has also been rumoured as a possible white knight in the event of a
hostile bid on Owners Abroad, the UK holiday group, from its UK rival
Airtours.
Dan-Air has also held unsuccessful partnership talks with British Midland,
the independent UK carrier in which Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) holds
a 40 per cent stake, and Air France.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Economics Notebook: Lamont sets his sights on the inflation
target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont's decision to add inflation targets to the pot pourri of
measures now being used to determine UK monetary policy was given a lukewarm
reception last week.
Some commentators, pointing out that inflation is a lagging indicator of
economic conditions, have likened the chancellor's idea to steering the
economy by using the rear view mirror.
Others, seeing how retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest
payments, fell to within its target range for the rest of this parliament of
1 per cent to 4 per cent within 24 hours of Mr Lamont's announcement, fear a
Treasury public relations trick.
A third group admit that the chancellor's objective of bringing inflation to
'2 per cent or less' by the end of the parliament is ambitious. However,
they ask why it should be believed in the light of Britain's persistent
failure to defeat inflation and the pound's recent exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism.
But there are some positive things to be said for the new idea. Two other
industrialised nations - New Zealand and Canada - have introduced inflation
targets with some success.
Moreover, the government's inflation objectives are not a stand-alone
policy. They will, if the Treasury sticks to its word, be subject to the
discipline of increased accountability to parliament and the public at
large.
The importance of this promised openness should not be underestimated.
Government in Britain is obsessively secretive and the Treasury is one of
the most secretive of Whitehall departments.
In his statement last Thursday, Mr Lamont said that if the government fails
to achieve its inflation targets 'it will have a duty to explain how this
had arisen, how quickly it intended to get back within the range, and the
means by which it would achieve this'.
He also said: 'It will be important to explain clearly to parliament and the
markets how we assess the progress being made towards the government's
inflation objectives.'
Treasury officials understand this reference to assessing progress as giving
parliament and the public the opportunity to hold the government to account
for how it is achieving its inflation targets. Mr Lamont has conceded more
than the principle of obliging the government to explain a missed inflation
target long after policy mistakes have been made.
Parliament, the press and the public should now expect the government to
disclose in a timely manner what it thinks of developments in narrow and
broad money supply, house prices and other asset prices, the exchange rate
and all the other indicators it will use to guide policy. In turn, the
Treasury and the Bank of England should expect pressure to improve the
information flow if their account of events is unsatisfactory.
Certainly, the Bank seems to welcome such glasnost. Speaking in Cambridge
last week, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, said the best way of
restoring confidence in economic policy was to accompany it 'by a
willingness to be open in explaining, to parliament and to the public at
large, the influences on inflation and our responses to them'.
Mr Lamont will have an opportunity to display how he views accountability
later today when he testifies to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service
Committee. By the end of November - after the chancellor's Mansion House
speech, the Autumn Statement and publication of the next Bank of England
quarterly bulletin - it should be possible to assess how far the government
is meeting its promises.
Increased accountability in the UK will have to substitute for institutional
disciplines available in other countries to make inflation targets
effective.
New Zealand gave its central bank independence with effect from February
1990 so that it could pursue price stability as a statutory goal.
The salary of Mr Don Brash, the Reserve Bank's governor, has been linked to
his ability to deliver stable prices, defined as an annual increase in the
consumer price index of zero to 2 per cent by the end of 1993. Mr Brash
responsed by aiming to hit the target by the end of this year and - with
inflation at around 1 per cent - he is almost certain to succeed.
The Bank of Canada does not enjoy such independence. But it has more
operational freedom than the Bank of England. The Bank of Canada and the
Department of Finance jointly announced in February 1991 that the annual
increase in consumer price inflation should fall to 3 per cent by December
this year and 2 per cent by December 1995. With core inflation currently
around 1.7 per cent, Canada is well ahead of its targets.
Canada's experiences are probably more relevant to the UK than those of New
Zealand. Britain and Canada are big economies: both import and export a
similar proportion of their gross national product. Since Britain's
departure from the ERM, both operate floating exchange rates and yet are
part of large trading areas.
Mr David Dodge, Canada's deputy finance minister, says inflation targets
have been a great success. 'They are the bedrock on which Canada bases its
monetary policy.'
The targets, he says, have helped the government to explain and defend its
policy and keep down wage increases.
In its recent annual survey of Canada, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development said the publication of the targets caused a
sharp drop in short-term inflationary expectations, particularly among
businesses.
But Mr Dodge stresses that inflation targets need to be backed up by other
policy instruments.
Canada has pursued a tough fiscal policy, including a legislated freeze on
civil service salaries, for example. Mr Dodge also insists that floating
exchange rates are essential if a country is to meet its inflation goals.
This last point should give Mr Lamont and the rest of the cabinet pause for
thought, if, as reported, the government is aiming to return sterling to the
ERM next year.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Nameless body to save the public face of Japan's banks: A
plan to relieve the burden of non-performing loans is near completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a comment by Mr Atsushi Takahashi describing the proposed land buying
body that is supposed to come to the rescue of Japan's troubled banks, 'We
don't want it to seem a paper company, and then again we don't want it to be
too large', the word 'seem' is one of the most important.
Appearances are an important issue in the design of the new body, a task now
close to completion. The banks wish it to convey the message that they are
solving the problem of non-performing loans. These unsightly assets,
gathered during the 'bubble' years of the late 1980s, will be transferred to
the collectively run company and off the banks' books.
Japanese banks argue that while these property-backed loans are a burden,
the impact on the banking system and their balance sheets has been
overstated. However, they are rushing to get the new body in place so that
transfers can begin well before the close of the financial year in March.
But there are serious doubts that the body - its formal name is yet to be
decided - will achieve its stated aims.
There are two objectives to the new body:
to relieve the burden of non-performing loans;
and stimulate the country's ailing property market, the weakness of which is
one cause of that burden.
It is unclear how long the burden of non-performing loans will limit the
banks' lending ability and retard Japan's economic growth. Estimates of the
size vary.
At the end of March the finance ministry estimated a figure of between
Y7,000bn to Y8,000bn (Pounds 39bn); Sumitomo Life Insurance, a leading
Japanese financial institution, estimated Y22,000bn; while some analysts put
the figure at Y50,000bn-plus.
The ministry is revising its estimate for the half-year just ended, and its
new figure is likely to be between Y10,000bn and Y12,000bn for the 21
leading banks. It will announce the figures later this month.
The burden is certainly larger than the official figure suggests. Japan's
definition of a non-performing loan is one on which interest has not been
paid for six months, compared with the 90-day period used in US definitions.
The official figures also exclude the problem loans held by bank affiliates,
many of the so-called 'non-banks', who were large property-related lenders
during the financial excesses of the late 1980s.
In the worst case, the failure of a large regional bank or of an institution
with close links to a leading bank could create a crisis of confidence in
the banking system.
While the banks concede they are weighed down by the non-performing loans,
they have remained confident that a crisis will not arise.
As Mr Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's top
corporate bank, confidently suggests, banks don't go bust in Japan.
But banks with bad loans are limited in their ability to provide new finance
to corporate customers, who are now unable to tap the equity market for
funds.
The weakness of the banks has itself cast a shadow over the stock market.
Although the market recovered strongly in the summer from its lows of early
in the year, it has started to look a little fragile in recent days.
Japanese bankers insist that the scale of their problems is far less than
that which caused the collapse of savings and loans institutions in the US.
American experience has, however, been closely studied during the
discussions in recent weeks over what form the land purchase agency should
take.
Interviews with a range of officials involved in the planning of the new
body suggest that it may work something like this:
Participating banks will provide capital for the agency and then give it
concessional loans.
These loans will provide the agency's working capital, and enable it to earn
income from the gap between its cut-rate borrowing and its market-rate
lending.
Non-performing loans and the property used as collateral will be bought by
the body as a package from a bank.
The property will be valued by an 'independent' assessor, a process that the
banks hope will set a floor for property prices, which have fallen almost 40
per cent over the last two years.
Banks will write off the difference between the amount at which the
transferred property is assessed and the value at which it is shown in their
books. The new body will then begin the task of gradually selling the
properties.
Sumitomo Trust, a leading trust bank, says the whole process could take as
long as 10 years; the amount of property to be sold is estimated at
Y10,000bn.
In carrying out this scheme, appearances are important in another way. The
new body must be seen to be funded by the banks and not by the public.
In reality, the Bank of Japan is likely to increase the amount commercial
banks can borrow from it at cheaper rates on the understanding that the
funds are pumped indirectly into the new company.
As well as this indirect assistance, the banks would like tax concessions on
write-offs from the Ministry of Finance. If things go terribly wrong, they
would probably attempt to hold Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to
his statement that he favours the use of public funds to support the banks.
However, such support, for an industry popularly perceived to have pumped
much money and air into Japan's financial bubble, would be very unpopular.
Sumitomo Trust expects the body will be ready to begin taking on the
troubled collateral by January, giving the banks plenty of time to shift
assets off their balance sheets before the end of March. Standards set by
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) require them to have capital
equal to 8 per cent of their assets on this date.
If all goes according to the banks' plans, the BIS's ratios will be met,
non-performing loans and unsaleable property will be removed from their
books, and they will benefit from a hoped-for recovery of the Japanese
economy, which would itself push up stock and land prices.
Such hopes may be overly optimistic. The banks admit that property market
turnover is 'dead', and concede that prices still have a way to fall.
Mr Kurosawa at the IBJ forecast a further 10 per cent fall, but another IBJ
official said perhaps '20 or 30 per cent'.
The government has promised to increase its land purchases over the next
year, but there are few other willing buyers at present. The big private
buyers of the past, particularly developers and ambitious manufacturers, are
drawing up their own reconstruction plans.
Instead of a neat, quick solution, there is likely to be a more
long-drawn-out consolidation of the banking system. Some smaller financial
institutions may disappear, while the larger banks will have to ensure their
profitability by cutting costs and improving their risk management.
And the new land purchase company may discover that it needs more than
indirect government help. If the issue of direct government aid arises,
there is likely to be an awkward public debate.
As Mr Kurosawa says: 'Bankers are very unpopular now. We are like tax
collectors in the days of Jesus.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / Quarter of UK fund managers see no return to ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUARTER of Britain's leading institutional fund managers believe the UK
will never return to the Exchange Rate Mechanism, according to a survey by
Gallup for stockbrokers Smith New Court.
Since the UK's departure from the ERM, the institutions have also raised
their forecasts for the 12-month inflation rate from 3 per cent to 4 per
cent.
The survey suggests scepticism for Mr Norman Lamont's new economic policy
laid out at last week's Conservative Party conference.
More than half the investors believed the UK would return to the ERM but not
within the next 12 months. Nearly a fifth thought re-entry would be after
three months but within a year.
Fund managers have sharply increased their interest in investing in
index-linked gilts. The survey showed a similar increase in fund managers
intending to reduce their holdings of UK conventional gilts.
The biggest change in sentiment was towards UK equities. The size of the
majority of fund managers intending to increase their UK holdings rose to
its highest level since April.
However, the institutions have shaved their estimates of earnings per share
growth in 1992 from 3.8 per cent to 3.2 per cent since the September survey.
One hundred institutions, which together handle funds worth Pounds 542bn,
took part in the survey.

<TEXT>
MR John MacGregor, recently cited as a possible future chancellor, yesterday
lined up squarely with senior cabinet colleagues backing Britain's early
return to the European exchange rate mechanism.
The transport secretary's unequivocal support for re-entry to the ERM as
soon as feasible will disappoint those who saw him as less controversially
'European' than Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary and the other
widely-tipped contender for chancellor.
In repeated statements since Britain left the ERM on September 16, Mr John
Major, the prime minister, has felt obliged to stress that there is no
question of Mr Norman Lamont being re-moved from the chancellorship.
However, speculation over Mr Lamont's medium-term future has continued,
fuelled by the poor reception from commentators and the City to his speech
at the Conservative party conference in Brighton last week.
The question mark over the chancellor provoked widespread discussion at the
fringes of the conference as to his likely successor.
While a straight switch of jobs between Mr Lamont and Mr Clarke was
mentioned as one option for the prime minister, some argued that Mr
MacGregor, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, would be a less
controversial alternative.
But Euro-sceptics rallying to Mr Lamont made clear such a move would be
viewed as a serious shift in the delicate balance of influences on the prime
minister towards the most vehemently pro-Maastricht Europeans. In a BBC
television interview, Mr MacGregor made plain yesterday that he was closely
allied to Mr Clarke, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade secretary, in the strongly pro-ERM faction of the
cabinet.
Taking care to pledge unqualified support for the chancellor's decision to
leave the mechanism, the transport secretary said unprecedented currency
flows had left no alternative, although the exit was 'a great pity'.
He added: 'Once we have sorted out what needs to be done to produce an ERM,
or post-ERM, that will assist the Community with dealing with those currency
flows, then we should be back in it.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / Shooting breaks out in Angola as tension mounts
</HEADLINE>

   LUANDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY SHOOTING erupted in the Angolan capital Luanda yesterday as tension
mounted between anti-riot police and armed soldiers of Unita, the rebel
movement defeated in the country's first democratic elections.
The shooting caused panic in the city centre and raised fears of a violent
showdown between the government and Unita, which has alleged that the
elections were fraudulent.
The gunfire came hours after a car bomb exploded at dawn near the Turismo
hotel where several senior Unita officials were staying. The bomb blasted
out windows as high as the sixth floor.
At least two civilians were killed, apparently caught in crossfire, and
several people were injured. Anti-riot police in flak jackets set up
roadblocks across Luanda. The international airport was cordoned off but
later reopened.
The incidents occurred as a United Nations Security Council crisis mission
arrived in Luanda to help salvage the Angolan peace process. The team flew
on to hold talks with Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, in his southern
stronghold of Huambo.
In four separate areas of Luanda, Unita soldiers fired machine-guns and
grenades at police. Shooting was most intense in a piazza in the city centre
where the car bomb had exploded.
After the car bomb blast, Unita troops took hostage 12 anti-riot policemen.
They were later released in a UN-arranged exchange for 35 Unita party
militants arrested by the ruling MPLA before the elections.
A Unita soldier was injured by shots fired from a passing car outside the
hotel where the bomb exploded. Other clashes took place in the suburbs of
Rosa Pinto and Gamek, near the UN compound.
A ceasefire was agreed later in the day and UN officials stepped in to calm
tempers. About 50 Unita soldiers were arrested.
The shooting reflects rising tension before the announcement of final
election results expected today or tomorrow.
Mr Savimbi has alleged massive electoral fraud but election investigators
have so far found evidence only of irregularities and mistakes. These, they
say, are largely explained by the ignorance of officials carrying out
democratic elections for the first time in a war-shattered country the size
of France, Spain and Germany combined.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BITTER war of words between the campaigns of President George Bush and
Governor Bill Clinton continued yesterday as their candidates and Mr Ross
Perot, the other contender, prepared for last night's critical first
televised presidential debate.
The debate could prove a pivotal moment in the campaign. It constitutes
probably the president's last opportunity to cut into Mr Clinton's
appreciable lead in all the public opinion polls, which continue to suggest
that the sharply negative turn in Republican campaigning is having no impact
on voter sentiment. A national poll out this weekend by Newsweek gave Mr
Clinton 44 per cent, Mr Bush 35 per cent and Mr Perot 12 per cent. This
survey, virtually unchanged in its overall numbers from last week's, has of
late consistently given Mr Clinton a smaller lead than others, which are now
mostly in the 14-16 points range.
Two polls in key swing states told a similar story. In Georgia, which Mr
Bush carried by 19 points in 1988, Mr Clinton was ahead by 44-38-7. In
Michigan, another comfortable Republican victory four years ago, the split
was 50-31-8.
Mr Charles Black, a senior adviser to Mr Bush, said in an interview that Mr
Clinton 'must meet a threshold level of trust, which he has not passed yet'.
He said Mr Clinton's 1970 trip to Moscow raised 'a legitimate question'
about the Democratic candidate's judgment.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, the Democrat's communications director, yesterday
again raised Mr Bush's involvement with the Iran-Contra scandals and with
the courting of Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait as evidence that could be
used against Mr Bush's 'judgment'. He drew particular attention to the
latest revelations in the BNL affair.
The Washington Post endorsed Mr Clinton in an editorial yesterday. Its
preference was not surprising, but its language towards Mr Bush was
conspicuously harsh.

FT  12 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK financial sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If today's CBI survey of financial sector companies is anything to go by,
banks and building societies will use any further cuts in interest rates as
an excuse to rebuild margins. True, spreads and commissions appear to be
widening at a slower rate than during 1991, when base rates were falling.
But the financial sector's determination is underlined by the fact that
spreads increased at all during the third quarter, a period of static
interest rates and deep recession.
The intriguing question is how the banks and building societies get away
with higher margins when they are also reporting demand for credit at a very
low ebb. One explanation might be that borrowers prefer to accept a higher
margin rather than run the risk of switching to a cheaper but unfamiliar
source of funds. Fears of a credit crunch have so far proved unfounded, but
it does not look as though lenders are in particularly generous mood either.

FT  12 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rank Organisation provides a telling example of the stark reality of
post-devaluation Britain. After Black Wednesday its shares rallied briefly -
and arguably without much justification since the company is well hedged
against currency movements. Then last week, they resumed a seemingly
inexorable decline with a fall of 10 per cent. The drop is all the more
eye-catching as the price is now roughly a third below its peak in May.
Could there be particular grounds for worry? After all, debt is
uncomfortably high at nearly Pounds 1bn and Rank Xerox, over which it has no
management control, has been doing badly in Japan.
There is a more prosaic, if still depressing explanation. By comparison with
other leisure shares Rank is traditionally volatile, but it has paced the
sector over the past year as a whole. Progress with its plan to raise
between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m by selling its UK hotels is painfully
slow. And weak consumer confidence has eaten away at the revenues of its UK
holiday business. So capital spending is having to be held down and may even
have to be reined in further. It seems unlikely that the company will be
able to trade its way into a more comfortable debt position.
But Rank is not the only cyclical stock facing similar problems. Devaluation
has not made unwanted assets any easier to sell. Nor has it turned out to be
a panacea with a magical promise of higher revenues. In Rank's case, there
is some consolation in the form of a yield of nearly 8 per cent. Whether
that is enough to sustain the shares is another matter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's merger of the Australian subsidiaries of Royal and Sun Alliance
 -just like General Accident's purchase of the Pru's Canadian non-life
business a day earlier - can be seen on one level as a mere footnote to
empire. UK composites simply cannot afford poor performing overseas
activities these days, even where they just represent a small part of their
revenues.
As the two deals just announced illustrate, the search is on for ways to
make more profitable the hodge podge of businesses - often based in former
British colonies - inherited in the UK insurance merger wave of the 1950s
and 1960s.
Sun appears to have taken the initiative in Australia, but the move fits in
neatly with Royal's avowed long-term strategy. Given the company's
relatively weak solvency ratio - brought about largely by its huge recent
losses on mortgage guarantee business - it is easy to jibe that such joint
ventures are primarily defensive. But that is a little unfair. Capital is
scarce throughout the sector - and management talent thin on the ground in
many overseas operations - so it surely makes sense to combine forces to
achieve critical mass where local conditions allow.
Royal's attempt to implement this thinking closer to home - through its Epic
network with Germany's AMB and Fondiaria of Italy - may so far be proving a
bit avant garde for its continental partners. But with the risks of outright
takeover demonstrated in Scandinavia this year, Epic may yet prove a more
durable European solution.
All this raises the question of whether the UK composites should co-operate
more in their own backyard. The conventional industry view is that further
concentration would raise monopoly problems. But one wonders whether the
real problem is a lack of boardroom will.

FT  12 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Counting the cash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For all Mr Lamont's fine words on public spending, the government's
borrowing requirement will probably end up not far short of Pounds 40bn next
year. The market is right to wonder exactly where the money is supposed to
come from. With sterling floating outside the ERM, overseas investors can no
longer be relied on to prop up the gilts market.
Yet the flow of funds into UK investment institutions is hardly encouraging.
Slow dividend growth from equities has reduced cash available for
reinvestment. Pension funds are squeezed on two fronts by recession: a
shrinking workforce and liabilities arising earlier than expected due to
early retirement. Life companies, which now contribute the majority of cash
flowing into the UK stock and bond markets, are finding traditional products
hard to sell.
The squeeze on pension funds could be particularly bad news for equities,
which are the best match for pension liabilities and make up over 90 per
cent of the average pension fund portfolio. The tougher conditions facing
life companies, which pioneered the tentative switch from equities to bonds
this year, are especially bad news for gilts. In aggregate, institutional
cash flow this year and next is unlikely to be much higher than Pounds 38bn
recorded in 1991.
The first hint of recovery would ordinarily prompt companies to step up
their demands on institutions in the form of rights issues to raise new
equity. A spate of cash takeover bids might help relieve the pressure, but,
given stretched corporate balance sheets and an aversion to debt, that
hardly seems likely. The government may be able to tempt institutions to
sell holdings of overseas bonds in favour of gilts, as they did immediately
after the general election. With the odds on higher UK inflation, though,
this switch now seems harder to justify.

Their opponents are Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, Mr Peter

As a new round of discussions on public expenditure begins this week, the
transport secretary made clear that a balance had to be found between
defending capital expenditure programmes and current spending on welfare
benefits. He hinted strongly that restraints on public sector pay rises were
almost certain to be part of the equation now being examined by Mr Lamont's
so-called EDX committee on the expenditure round.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Sense on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over a decade ago I published How to End the Monetarist Controversy, which
resolved the issue to my satisfaction if not of the economics industry. I
will now attempt a similar service for the exchange rate controversy . This
is therefore a theoretical article.
Is the exchange rate just a market price like that of tomatoes, or should it
be the anchor for policy against inflation? The tomato analogy cannot bear
too much weight. For the exchange rate is a link between the national price
level and that of the rest of the world. If the price of tomatoes falls by
half, there need be no sizeable effect on inflation. If sterling falls by 50
per cent a large number of UK prices will eventually double. This is most
obvious with goods and services which face competition in international and
domestic markets; but the effects will spread more slowly towards the
sheltered sectors.
What then is the case for flexible exchange rates? I have tried to
illustrate it in the accompanying chart in terms of a hypothetical path for
the sterling/D-Mark rate over the 1990s. The argument for flexibility is
that there are various shocks which can be absorbed by a movable exchange
rate, so long as Germany remains committed to price stability and the
depreciation of sterling in the early 1990s is offset by a later
appreciation.
Letting sterling sag against the D-Mark imparts a deflationary shock to
Germany to counter the inflationary strains of unification, but one which
can be allowed to ease off as time goes on. It also allows a temporary
easing of British monetary policy so long as output and employment in the UK
are lower than necessary to 'bear down on inflation'. The UK can also offset
the effect of a weak dollar on its overseas competitiveness by allowing
sterling to fall as well and then tightening policy as the dollar recovers.
These are but topical examples. The line marked 'ideal scenario' exhibits
short-term flexibility combined with long-term stability in the
sterling/D-Mark exchange rate.
The same arguments can be applied to the regions of a country. Northern
Ireland or eastern Germany could have their own currencies which could be
temporarily allowed to depreciate without much permanent inflationary effect
so long as the depreciation eventually comes to an end.
What then is the snag in a multiplicity of fluctuating currencies? There are
transactions and nuisance costs. More important is that that no one knows
the true position of the floating rate paths I have glibly sketched.
Unpredictable exchange rate variations make it particularly difficult for
business to treat the whole area covered by all currencies as a single
market.
But most important of all is the extreme difficulty of ensuring that
sterling does return to the upper line on the chart rather than move into a
vicious, if slow-motion, circle of inflation and depreciation. The danger
might be less for another country with a better inflationary record. A
specific danger of the UK Treasury strategy of 'taking sterling into
account' without a specific target is that a series of policy judgments,
each defensible in itself, eventually takes sterling along the 'sinking
pound' line, as indeed happened in the mid-1980s when such a policy was in
force.
The fixed exchange option rate is shown in the 'return to ERM' line at, say,
DM2.6. In exchange for the loss of flexibility it does ensure the
achievement and maintenance of German-type rate of inflation, which has no
adverse effect on growth and jobs once people have become accustomed to it.
There is nothing to prevent a compromise such as going back to the original
ERM idea of occasional modest parity changes, leaving the depreciating
country with the onus of keeping to the recovery path. But the compromise
does require more thought about the mechanics of adjustment, without
insisting that only Britain is in step.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK'S announcement that the government will bring forward proposals to
reform the Sunday trading laws is welcome, if long overdue. Every week,
millions of consumers vote with their feet for the convenience of Sunday
trading. Many of the stores which oblige them flout the law to do so, while
the the government blames confusion over a possible clash between the Shops
Act and the Treaty of Rome for inaction.
Now the government says that it will frame new legislation, with measures to
protect the rights of shopworkers who do not wish to work on Sundays. The
latter will do much to ease opposition from those who feared that
shopworkers would be dragooned into Sunday working against their desire or
principles.
However, there is still no clarity over the form of the new legislation. A
menu of options will be put before parliament to find a consensus on this
thorny issue. That menu will not include complete deregulation of shopping
hours, the attempt at which in 1986 led to defeat in the Commons. It would
be undesirable, however, if partial deregulation led to new and equally
unworkable restrictions on Sunday trading which were also widely flouted.
And the leisurely timetable envisaged means that the new legislation is
unlikely to be in place much before 1994. Not only will that leave millions
of Sunday shoppers and thousands of stores which serve them in legal limbo.
It will also allow the alliance of sabbatarians and shopworkers' unions to
mobilise their undoubtedly effective campaigning skills. Swift legislation
with copper-bottomed protection for those who do not wish to work on Sundays
would be the preferable approach.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Bundesbank's waiting game
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK has emerged from the foreign exchange turbulence of the past
month with its international credibility fully restored. Sterling, the
French franc and any other pretenders to the D-Mark's anti-inflationary
throne have been put firmly in their place. But at home, the Bundesbank's
position is far less comfortable. Until Mr Helmut Kohl's solidarity talks
bear tangible fruit, the Bundesbank must remain unyielding. Official German
interest rates have now been too high for too long. But they may have to
remain high for a while longer.
The Bundesbank has performed its foreign exchange balancing act with great
skill. It has kept official interest rates high, offering only a modest cut
in the discount rate which has been more than offset by a trade-weighted
appreciation of the D-Mark. But heavy intervention to support the franc has
caused short-term money market interest rates to fall by almost a full
percentage point since their August peak, allowing a number of European
countries to cut their interest rates too.
Blunt instrument
Yet Germany's domestic imbalances are more than the Bundesbank's artistry
can handle alone. Loose fiscal policy continues to stoke up domestic
inflationary pressure outside the traded goods sector. But monetary policy
is proving to be a very blunt instrument with which to deal with this
service sector inflation. The rapid growth of the distorted broad money
aggregate only confirms the resilience of publicly subsidised spending and
investment to high interest rates.
The Bundesbank may choose to ignore this broad money overshoot but it cannot
ignore the underlying inflationary pressure. Private service output grew by
5 per cent in the year to the second quarter and service sector prices are
rising at an annual 5.2 per cent, explaining why consumer price inflation is
still creeping up. The new value-added tax, to be introduced in January,
will also raise consumer price inflation and risks feeding into wage
demands.
The longer that the Bundesbank is left alone to deal with these problems,
the greater the risks. High interest rates and a strong D-Mark already have
German industry in a vice: industrial output grew by just 0.8 per cent in
the year to the second quarter, orders are depressed and profits are
squeezed. The last thing that Germany needs is a deep recession in the
traded goods sector which pulls the rest of the economy down with it and
pushes the fiscal deficit out of control.
Veiled promises
Yet the Bundesbank cannot move unless there is an offsetting tightening of
fiscal policy and evidence that wage demands will moderate over the coming
year. Veiled promises of compromises to come are not enough.
The rest of the German political establishment must shoulder its share of
the burden. Mr Kohl must propose higher and more progressive income taxes to
close the fiscal deficit. The unions must agree to zero real wage growth in
west Germany based on an inflation rate next year of no more than 3 per
cent. The employers, with union agreement, must scrap the misguided plan for
wage convergence between the eastern and western lander.
Only then will the Bundesbank be right to yield. For now it has no choice
but to leave the discount and Lombard rates unchanged, however unpopular
both in Germany and in Europe. Germany's European partners already have good
reason to feel aggrieved. But they should address their complaints to Bonn.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Pandora's box or a panacea: EC members are pinning their
hopes on subsidiarity to calm fears about European integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Subsidiarity is an unlovely word of uncertain meaning. Yet virtually all EC
leaders profess to believe it contains magic potent enough to bring European
integration out of arguably the worst crisis of confidence it has faced.
But when European Commission president Jacques Delors, as much as his
erstwhile foe Lady Thatcher, President Francois Mitterrand of France, no
less than UK prime minister John Major, all discern extraordinary properties
in subsidiarity, there is a prima facie case for wondering whether it is
more snake oil than silver bullet.
Although subsidiarity in essence means that the EC should act only when
measures taken nationally or locally would be ineffectual, it is being sold
as an all-purpose remedy:
To recapture Danish voters' support for Maastricht, which they narrowly
rejected in June;
To persuade Europhobes in the UK that national governments will be - as
British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd put it last week - 'firmly in the
driving seat' in the European Union blueprinted by Maastricht;
To clip the wings of the Commission in Brussels, which has been demonised as
a Eurocracy hungry for power and out of control;
To proclaim that EC decisions will be brought closer to the people -
although this impression is frequently given by coating the principle of
subsidiarity with the more subversive ideas of open decision-making and
strengthened democratic accountability. And it is not clear more democracy
is on offer.
Last week in Luxembourg, foreign ministers of the 12 had a first stab at
agreeing on the procedures through which to apply subsidiarity, while
postponing substantive discussion on what it means until the emergency
summit of EC heads of government at Birmingham on Friday.
After then, it should become clear whether subsidiarity is anything more
than a turf battle, with national governments trying to soothe public
opinion into believing that if they rein in an interfering, pettifogging
Brussels bureaucracy, all will be well. 'National and European bureaucrats
can clearly mark out their territory,' as one Dutch diplomat put it, 'but
that doesn't tell you where the people come in.'
On the evidence so far, moreover, subsidiarity may end up causing as many
Euro-headaches as it cures. Already there is concern that it could:
undermine the single market, due to be completed by the end of 1992; roll
back achievements in EC-wide environmental, regional and social policy; and
upset the balance between big and small states which is part of the basic
chemistry of the Community's post-war success.
Most EC governments, however, facing a backlash against 'Europe' at home,
have reached for the easiest scapegoat - the Commission in Brussels. While
understandable, and not altogether unmerited, this is disingenuous.
The Commission is peopled by true believers. A senior official admits it has
'tended to conduct itself like a commando operation'. Like most
bureaucracies it has stretched its powers. But it has not usurped them.
The EC's basic power mechanism is that the Commission, nominated by member
governments, proposes, the directly-elected European Parliament advises and
can sometimes amend, but only the Council of Ministers - the elected,
national ministers of the 12 - can decide EC law.
Most EC measures are taken at the behest of member states, even though the
Commission has sole right to propose. This monopoly right bestows power but
also vulnerability. Governments regularly pass the buck to 'Brussels' for
unpopular or misfired measures, and evade opprobrium for suggestions they
make, which if they came from the Commission, would be seen as interference.
In the last year for instance, the Commission has twice refused Council
invitations to formulate an EC dietary policy - an idea at least as
intrusive as the apocryphal Euro-condom Brussels supposedly advocated.
Some governments agitate for measures their partners regard as intrusive.
The UK, a leading belligerent for subsidiarity, wants strict enforcement of
EC competition rules which frustrate French efforts to operate an industrial
policy. The British government has had bruising encounters with Brussels on
EC environment regulations, but still wants an EC inspectorate to ensure
countries like Italy and Portugal observe the rules. Denmark, for its part,
fears EC environment policy might dilute its high green standards, and wants
it strengthened.
The outlook could be worse, paradoxically, for regional and social policy,
two rare areas in which the EC partly practises the 'bottom-up' approach
subsidiarity supposedly calls for. EC regional funding in backward and
industrially stricken areas elicits decision-making and initiative by
regional and even municipal governments, which put forward the projects and
help finance them. This has irked national governments in the UK and even
federal Germany, because the Commission is to an extent by-passing them. As
main budgetary contributors to this EC spending, the biggest after
agriculture, they increasingly question its validity.
But a much more fundamental issue was raised by last month's attempt by the
most powerful member states, Germany, the UK and France, to dilute the
Commission's sole right to propose. As ambassadors of the 12 worked out how
subsidiarity could be applied, these 'big three' pushed for a formula
whereby the Commission would have to submit its proposals to member states
for scrutiny at the draft stage.
Their nine partners - even the discreet minutes of these meetings show  -
saw this as a naked power-grab. Given that subsidiarity is partly a sop to
the Danes, it was ironically the smaller countries which were particularly
concerned their bigger partners would get a lockhold on the Commission, and
tilt legislation in their favour. The fear is that Brussels would have to
clear its ideas with the big countries because they hold nearly two-thirds
of Council votes.
'The smaller countries rely on us to defend their interests,' said one
senior Commission official. 'Without a Commission which performs, their
stake in Europe is devalued.'
The ambassadors' compromise, likely to go to Birmingham, is that any state
can object to Brussels proposals by invoking subsidiarity, but would need
the support of six of its partners to block them. This would 'force the
Commission to think twice before coming up with something', said a Dutch
diplomat, 'but member states will not be able to force their opinions on the
Commission'.
Mr Delors himself partly regained the initiative at the Lisbon summit in
June. Since then, the Commission has been screening its activity in the
light of subsidiarity, and attaching a 'recital' to its proposals explaining
why action at Community level is needed. Member states should now have to
justify any complaints of interference in the same terms.
This is still a recipe for squabbles, rather than a clear division of powers
on the federal model. It is not the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution,
which reserves all powers not delegated to the federal government to the
states, much less Germany's constitution, which vests all power in the
Lander except as prescribed in Article 30 of the federation's Basic Law.
'You could give the US constitution to a 10-year old,' says one senior
Commission official, 'and they would understand it; whereas the Maastricht
treaty is understood only by those who have been to a French law school.'
Unlike the US or Germany, the EC (and European Union foreseen by Maastricht)
is only a quasi-federation. Moreover, unlike a real federal system, it was
put together back-to-front. Until now the Community has often preoccupied
itself with the little, niggling things - allowable levels of lawnmower
noise and pig manure, or quality standards for headed cabbages, for instance
 -while the heart of any federation, economic and monetary policy, and
foreign and defence policy, has been jealously reserved to national
governments.
The EC action may be answering requests from member governments, which do
not trust each other to flatten their part of the level playing field called
for by the barrier-free single market. Yet the measures often look at first
glance like what a local council, let alone a national government, should be
doing, rather than a remote, and moreover 'foreign' bureaucracy.
Much of the opposition to Maastricht has been to the often intrusive 282
directives creating the single market, rather than the contents of the
treaty. Nevertheless, the Commission and member governments have done
precious little to dispel people's fears that Maastricht means greater
centralisation and loss of national identity. There would seem not to be
enough either in the treaty or the tricky notion of subsidiarity to reassure
them.
Maastricht gives the European Parliament in Strasbourg the right to veto
laws passed by majority vote in Council, partly to compensate for the loss
of national veto, partly to bolster the role of directly elected
legislators. But Europe's parliament has yet to convince citizens it is of
use to them.
The main extensions of EC powers in the treaty, furthermore, could reduce
accountability and make decisions more opaque. The two new 'pillars' to the
main EC treaty - a common foreign and eventually defence policy, and
co-operation on justice and internal security issues ranging from drugs to
immigration - are inter-governmental, outside the EC remit. Member states
will act jointly, but on present arrangements outside effective oversight of
either national parliaments or Strasbourg. The Danes, whose Folketing keeps
the closest watch on the EC but also wants more powers for the European
Parliament, have a point. Unless subsidiarity turns out to mean more
democracy, the treaty is not democratic enough.
Ideas to staunch the leakage of accountability, ranging from opening up
Council law-making to public scrutiny, and a greater role for national
parliaments, are getting a hearing but not yet hardening.
The debate is still stuck on subsidiarity - at the moment not much more than
a piece of molten plastic on which EC leaders otherwise at cross-purposes
can stamp their own political seal.
But this does not deny the force of Mr Delors' recent, partly self-critical
observation to an audience of businessmen, that 'Europe began as an elitist
project (in which it was) believed that all that was required was to
convince the decision-makers. That phase of benign despotism is over.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Danish dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SEEKING to resolve the conundrum left by its rejection of the Maastricht
treaty in June, Denmark seems to have taken the advice of a celebrated
former counsellor at the Danish court. The adage of Shakespeare's Polonius -
'Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; take each man's censure, but
reserve thy judgement' - runs through the 251 pages of the long-awaited
white paper published in Copenhagen on Friday.
The document assembles a list of eight options for Denmark's relationship
with the EC. Yet it pointedly fails to give any recommendation on the course
the country will actually take. That will be worked out in negotiations both
with the Danish opposition parties, and with the other 11 EC partners - a
procedure aiming to find a compromise capable of being approved in a new
Danish referendum next year.
Some of Denmark's objections to Maastricht - for instance, its request for
clearer definition of how the 'subsidiarity' principle will be applied -
seem likely to end up as welcome additions to the treaty. Other points,
however, if appended as riders effective for all EC members, could end up
making the document more rather than less opaque in both in its political
aims and its areas of practical application. Denmark already has what
amounts to an 'opt-out' clause on economic and monetary union. Under the
deal last December, the third stage of Emu would not come into force for
Denmark unless it was agreed in a separate referendum.
Denmark now wants additional safeguards to prevent it from being
press-ganged into a future European defence community, as well as to avoid
lowering its high standards of environmental and social protection.
Considerable legal and political complexities still lie ahead. One of the
most intriguing of the eight options presented on Friday is one under which
Denmark could ratify the treaty subject to a time-limit. This would allow it
to withdraw later if the Community developed in a manner deemed prejudicial
to Danish national interests.
It is hardly surprising that, in their initial reactions, officials in
Brussels are taking a distinctly cautious view of the chances of agreeing a
workable compromise between Copenhagen and the other 11. The EC as a whole
has to steer a mid-course between the general desire to avoid wholesale
renegotiation of the treaty, and the necessity to find some means of Danish
ratification to allow Maastricht - with appropriate amendments - to come
into effect.
Denmark has its own dilemma. A large majority of the Danish electorate,
according to opinion polls, does not want to opt out of the EC as it stands.
And the Danes want to remain as firmly as possibly associated with the EC of
the future - if only to maintain the degree of political influence over its
development which they have so evidently wielded since the night of June 2.
Negotiating a solution to the 'Danish problem' will require considerably
more diplomatic and political skills than the EC has displayed during the
Maastricht process so far. The only reason for being even moderately
sanguine is that, unless they come up with an escape route, EC politicians
will find themselves accused, still more than today, of furthering the cause
not of European integration, but of European disarray.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Arts: Magnificent Porgy moves into the light - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This magnificent production, one of the most valuable and meaningful in
20th-century British opera, arrives in London to set the seal on what has
already been, by and large, a year of splendid Royal Opera achievement. It
started life in 1986, at Glyndebourne. There, as the first British
opera-house staging of Gershwin's opera, it proved a milestone in the
history of the work - a work always highly popular since its first showing
but not always equivalently highly rated.
At Glyndebourne - in a Trevor Nunn production conducted by Simon Rattle,
designed by John Gunter (sets) and Sue Blane (costumes), and with a cast of
superlatively fine singing-actors led by Willard White and Cynthia Haymon -
Porgy and Bess finally threw off the shackles of its folk-opera,
enlarged-musical or what-have-you status.
There it was demonstrated beyond argument as a 'real' opera, its roots in
popular sources (nothing new in the long and problematic history of opera)
but its branches reaching out culturally far and wide. There the notion was
finally laid to rest of a work somehow demeaning of the black people who
perform in it. There it was shown to be, not flawless - any more than any
other significant first opera is ever flawless - but so gloriously full of
'felt life' that the flaws came to matter very little.
Now the production is re-created at Covent Garden - with Nunn and most of
the original principals back at their stations, but with Andrew Litton
replacing Rattle as conductor. More often than not, deprived of the
circumstances that brought them to birth, productions borrowed turn out to
be productions diluted in their vision. This one is different. It positively
demanded to be seen and heard outside the Glyndebourne hothouse; it badly
needed to be given again before a wider audience (which the large number of
Covent Garden performances, including two sponsored for 'non-typical'
visitors to the house, plus a promised video recording thereafter, will make
more possible).
As Friday's performance made plain, the production has indeed been
re-created, not simply reproduced. People with still-vivid memories of the
Glyndebourne experience may feel, as I do, that the much larger London
theatre reduces the sense of engulfment, of being sucked into an operatic
world so richly stocked in melody, word and action that it was a cruel
come-down to have to leave the theatre at all. (The storm prayers, though
still vibrantly sung by the special Porgy chorus, fail to lift the roof off
as they did in Sussex.)
The length of the work and its episodic detailing seem to weigh rather more
heavily in its later stages - but no doubt this is a direct result of the
Royal Opera decision, badly ill-advised as it turns out, to break the
three-act structure into two cumbersomely long halves separated by a single
interval.
On the other hand, the larger theatre gives air to Gershwin's heavily padded
scoring, and renders balance with voices less of a constant trial of
conductorial skills. Mr Litton, in his house debut, makes the most of the
house advantages: he keeps the music light, rhythmically forward and
texturally well-ventilated, finds tautly 'continuous' drama in Gershwin's
format of recitative and song, and altogether proves himself a marvellously
apt, idiomatically assured Porgy conductor.
The added space also aids the producer in clarifying even further the fine
detail of communal life. The opening scene and finale (with its
controversial breaching of the Catfish Row facade as Porgy throws his sticks
aside and walks into the light) particularly show the art of opera direction
at its most elevated: every strand of action filled with musical point and
purpose, a bounty of sharply honed (but never stagey) individual
characterisations forged into an organic ensemble. The broad comic
insertions, part of what were once fiercely stigmatised (by Duke Ellington)
as the opera's 'lamp-black Negroisms', chime fitly with the tragedy.
Awe-inspiring new insights into their roles have been discovered by all the
original principals - Marietta Simpson's brilliantly tough-tender Maria,
Cynthia Clarey's gauntly imposing Serena, Gregg Baker's towering Crown and
Damon Evans's chillingly intelligent, witty Sporting Life are only the
foremost of too many names demanding to be mentioned as exemplars of this
developmental process. The young English soprano Tinuke Olafimihan, new as
Clara, bursts into flower with a ravishingly pure, bright-toned
'Summertime'; Gordon Hawkins, a sturdy, attractively relaxed Jake, replaces
Bruce Hubbard (who died last year tragically young).
But all pale before the tendernesses and subtleties revealed, the depths
sounded and heights scaled - separately and mutually - by the occupants of
the title roles. Miss Haymon's Bess moves from vulgar exuberance to
heartrending quiet frailty with absolute authority; Mr White's Porgy is even
darker in opening-scene misanthropy, more vulnerable and candid in
happiness, more gut-wrenchingly heroic at the end. (Vocally, he sounded
tired by the time that Everest of a top G in 'I got to be with Bess' was
reached, and no wonder.) At the centre-point of a production which makes
opera seem the grandest and most ennobling of all the arts, this partnership
forms an ideal pivot.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Arts: Tosca's careful brutality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh National Opera's Tosca, directed by Michael Blakemore and conducted by
Carlo Rizzi, is the company's second new production of the season. It is a
carefully worked, thoughtful staging, well presented musically, and in style
and approach light years away from WNO's recent Elektra.
The essence of Blakemore's approach to his first opera is faithful
historical realism. In one sense it is almost super-real, for Ashley Martin
Davis's sets are dominated by vivid, larger-than-life icons. The torso of a
gigantic figure of Christ and the hand of a huge Madonna menace the interior
of Sant'Andrea della Valle in the first act, in which the Mary Magdalene in
Cavaradossi's painting is shown baring her breast. Scarpia's apartment
sports a statue of Bacchus, while the battlements of Act 3 are capped by a
massive, swooping angel, avenging sword in hand.
Menace and oppression are omnipresent in this production, mingled with
suffocating religiosity. Violence is ever visible. When a republican
sympathiser rises to show the flag during the splendidly staged Te Deum at
the end of the first act he is brutally clubbed to the floor; before
Cavaradossi can be brought to his execution an earlier victim has to be cut
down and stretchered away. Blakemore builds a thoroughly credible vision of
despotic rule while sticking closely to the book and never calling for any
feeble-minded transpositions of period or place.
The approach relies more than usual upon the portrayal of Scarpia - had
Peter Sidhom's performance delivered the regulation cardboard villain the
whole edifice could have collapsed into grand guignol. But Sidhom gives a
wonderfully subtle characterisation, sung and acted with great suavity and
intelligence, and only lacking a final ounce of vocal weight. It is easy to
believe such a man has the cunning to operate this regime of savage
repression and that he might cut a credible figure sexually too; the second
act depicts not the usual manoeuvres of a repellent old lecher but something
far more ambiguous and disturbing.
With a more distinguished Cavaradossi there really would have been a teasing
polarity. During the tour of the production there will be two Cavaradossis
and no less than four Toscas; Dennis O'Neill should have sung at Saturday's
opening but was injured and replaced by Maurizio Saltarin. He made a
plausible Italianate sound but hardly began to phrase meaningfully, breaking
lines and taking breaths wherever he saw fit and bringing no life to the
role whatsoever.
His Tosca this time was Suzanne Murphy (the other members of the quartet
will be Marion Vernette Moore, Christine Bunning and Anne Heath-Welch).
Murphy is a tried and trusted Puccini singer in Wales and utterly dependable
here though never vocally thrilling. If her duets with Saltarin barely
reached blood heat it was not her fault nor that of Rizzi, who conducted a
beautifully buoyant account of the score, full of airy textures and athletic
rhythms. The intensity of the drama was never to be doubted.  .TX- Tosca,

FT  12 OCT 92 / Arts: A house in fine order - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE

<TEXT>
Garcia Lorca was killed on 19 August, 1936, by the fascist paramilitary
Black Squad. He was 38. He had finished writing La Casa de Bernada Alba that
June, concluding the folk trilogy he began in 1933 with Bodas de sangre and
which he continued with Yerma in 1934; Bernada Alba was first performed in
Madrid in 1945.
The Gate Theatre, Notting Hill, has staged a tense, powerful production,
using Matthew Banks' sinewy translation of Lorca's all-women play. The small
theatre refashions the claustrophobia of Lorca's mis en scene: a hacienda,
walls dark in the midday heat, shafts of light striking into the gloom.
To start, the house of Alba is in black, mourning for Bernada's husband.
Bernada has a social station to maintain, five daughters to marry. She
tyrannises them: 'I have to fight tooth and nail to keep them tame and
decent.' Inside, the daughters sew, plait, and mourn; outside, men pass by,
singing, working: 'needle and thread for the women, mule and whip for the
men.' According to custom, Bernada's eldest becomes betrothed; but the man
loves the youngest daughter, Adela. The middle daughter, Martirio, envies
both.
Outside swirls a violent, medieval world, with demands of fealty to church
and society. A woman is stoned for bearing an illegitimate child. Everything
out there proves Bernada right in protecting her daughters as she does. She
may appear to be a conduit for men's violence and sexuality rolling down the
generations to swamp her daughters; but her viciousness is also her own. The
unspoken issue is the oppression of women by men, and of women by each
other. This speaks to the 1990s: for as gender becomes sect, great
oppression is now gathering in the name of egality.
Katie Mitchell's intelligent, emphatic direction allows the play to express
itself metaphorically. It speaks of marriage, sexuality, and the constraints
and commitments of community. Bernada's house, isolated and xenophobic, is
1930s Spain, run on violence and tyranny. The malaise of the daughters
suggests the deeper waste in Spanish society. The sexuality which smashes
the social bonds hints at Lorca's own homosexuality.
Dinah Stabb as Bernada, Alexandra Gilbreath as Adela, and Kristin Hewson as
Martirio act with great tact and assurance, and provide the play's hard
core. Ben Livingstone (music) should have chosen something more
Iberian-Catholic than Bach's St Matthew Passion to punctuate the acts.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Arts: Bad vision at Victoria - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best kind of architecture is appropriate architecture. But what is
'appropriate'? The word means fit, expedient, apt, suitable and belonging in
its proper place. Propriety comes into it too - a sense of things being
commensurate one with another. What seems to worry so many people about
large out-of-scale and often brutal contemporary buildings is that they
exhibit bad manners and do not make much effort to settle down appropriately
with their neighbours.
These thoughts were prompted by the display and publication of an exhibition
of proposals for the long overdue improvement of the forecourt of London's
Victoria Station.
To me the model of these proposals is a demonstration of inappropriateness.
The designs are the work of Britain's respected establishment modern
architect, Michael Hopkins. Mr Hopkins has designed two office buildings to
replace the present huddle of low and indifferent buildings on Victoria
Street. The two buildings are the chief ingredients of a scheme that is
intended to pay for the reorganisation of the tube station, the new glass
canopied bus stand and the pedestrian square in front of the listed station
facade.
Clearly the cost of all this very necessary sorting out of the interchange
is high and that must be the reason for the 22 storey office tower that will
'release the maximum area of land for the transport interchange and public
spaces'.
About the last thing Victoria needs is another office block. What is seen
here is an accountants' exercise on how to pay for transport improvements at
a time when there is not enough public funding. It is a technique that
worked at Liverpool Street - but at Broadgate it was possible to think on a
much bigger scale at a time when the building of offices actually made
money.
The tower at Victoria will, like all of Mr Hopkins's buildings, have a
certain cool elegance although its stepped profile unfailingly reminded me
of the Trump Tower on New York's Fifth Avenue. I doubt whether it will have
the razzmatazz interior of the Trump Tower.
In its present form, Victoria station provides a great sense of anti-climax
when you arrive there, especially if you have just been whisked in
high-speed comfort from Gatwick airport. It is not the station itself but
the bizarre and extraordinary muddle that is presented to the arriving
passenger. There are taxis, buses and a complicated tube station that seems
to promise dirt and danger rather than an easy and elegant entrance to
London.
The redevelopment proposals are from a joint venture put together by
Greycoat Estates and London Transport. They replace a scheme that was
prepared for the same site by the American architects Skidmore Owings and
Merrill.
Mr Hopkins is a good modern architect. In London, as well as the
modernisation of Lords cricket ground, Mr Hopkins was responsible for the
conversion of Bracken House, former home of the Financial Times, and the
interior design of this newspaper's new editorial offices at Southwark
Bridge. He has designed the extension to the Houses of Parliament with the
new Westminster underground station that is yet to be built. I am
particularly looking forward to the new Opera House Michael Hopkins has
designed at Glyndebourne which will open in 1994.
For Victoria, I can see the virtue of employing Mr Hopkins - an architect
who has done what his clients asked him to do. But the underlying commercial
thesis is wrong and has been forced upon London by the dire political and
economic climate. Westminster City Council should put these proposals on ice
for a while. There can be no call for more offices, which would overshadow
Victoria station and do little for the area. Pragmatism has its place in
life but London and Londoners deserve a bit more vision at Victoria - not
another inappropriate commercial compromise.
Members of the public can judge the plans for themselves at the exhibition
which is on the station forecourt behind the bus station until October 23rd.
Open Monday to Friday, 7.30am to 6.30pm.

Zambia is the subject of the last of BBC2's series Out Of Darkness (7.50)

Kaunda's 26-year presidency which was marked by widespread corruption.
Perhaps we should be relishing current affairs programmes in peak viewing

the government's new whelk-stall philosophy of broadcasting. World In Action

American children (well, American lawyers on behalf of children) have used
the law to oppose their parents' smoking habits. Shades of Huxley's 'Brave

FT  12 OCT 92 / Management: Accident prevention at a premium for local
councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every time a pedestrian has tripped over an uneven paving stone, Britain's
local authorities have been used to passing on claims for twisted ankles to
their insurance company. In most cases, that has been Municipal Mutual.
The multitude of claims, plus an epidemic of burning schools and a potential
wave of claims from former residents of children's homes, is currently
threatening the very survival of MMI. Last week it abruptly withdrew from
the market, leaving some councils with no option but to close facilities to
the public.
The immediate problem of councils' lack of cover has been overcome: other
insurers have stepped in, but at a price. Councils are not only having to
pay higher premiums, they are also being forced to change their approach to
risk.
Risk management programmes, which include the installation of safety
equipment and tighter operational management designed to reduce small
claims, are common in industry and have already been adopted by some larger
councils.
According to Ken Kennedy, risk and facilities manager at Surrey County
Council, more local authorities may be forced to follow suit. 'Risk
management will be a 'lever' which local authorities can use to negotiate
lower insurance rates,' says Kennedy, who chairs the recently-formed
Association of of Local Authority Risk Managers.
'Funding risks through insurance alone just isn't an option any more,' says
Terry Sparkes, chairman of the Institute of Risk Management.
MMI insured 90 per cent of Britain's district, county and metropolitan
councils, covering their buildings, vehicles and liabilities to employees
and the public. The relationship was mutually convenient. Local authorities
were highly loyal customers. Until relatively recently, MMI placed little
demand on the councils to control their losses, offering comprehensive cover
relatively cheaply.
Insurance companies stepping into the breach created by MMI's demise are
likely to make much more demand on councils to control their risks and limit
claims. 'The first question insurance companies are going to ask local
councils is 'what is your risk management strategy?',' says Kennedy.
Bigger county and metropolitan authorities - which spend between Pounds 5m
and Pounds 10m annually on insurance premiums - are meeting claims of under
Pounds 100,000 from their own resources and deploying risk management
techniques to reduce the likelihood of claims.
Risk managers point to successes in a number of authorities. In
Nottinghamshire losses from arson which grew sharply in the late 1980s,
totalling Pounds 1.6m in 1989, have fallen since risk manager Bill Sulman
introduced a prevention scheme in 1991. Sulman has spent Pounds 500,000 on
security measures - better fencing, alarm systems and lighting - at
vulnerable schools in inner city Nottingham.
Cheshire County Council, which has also been badly hit by arson in its
schools, has just completed fitting sprinklers to the Park Primary School in
Runcorn, one of a number of schools to be set on fire last year.
Both Cheshire and Nottingham are also taking measures to reduce a steady
trickle of small claims from local authority employees who have suffered
back injuries and members of the public who have suffered accidents because
of badly maintained roads.
David Bull, a risk manager who doubles as Cheshire's legal officer, says
that under new insurance arrangements negotiated recently, the authority
must meet the cost of most small claims itself, providing an incentive for
managers to stop accidents happening.
'We are trying to end the tyranny of small claims which take up so much
time. The handling of the claims can simply bleed the organisation of
resources,' he says. 'We're getting people to think much more about the
risks to which they are exposed. Accidents at work can be stopped by
relatively minor changes.'
Sulman warns that claims from people who have suffered from abuse when they
were children in council controlled homes, have risen sharply recently.
Victims of the 'pin-down' disciplinary regime, for example, recently won
settlements of Pounds 2m in Staffordshire.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Management: Global executives walk a tightrope - How the new
breed of managers can come to terms with a confusing world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the gospel of 'globalisation' first gripped western companies in the
middle and late-1980s, many reacted crudely, as if national differences in
markets and strategy suddenly mattered no longer.
It has taken them several years to realise that there is no single 'correct'
balance between global, regional and local strategies. Unlike most Japanese
companies, they have found it hard to come to terms with the fact that the
ideal mix varies not only across industries, but also inside them: between
different businesses, product lines and even individual products within the
same line. It also changes over time.
Some companies have still not got that message about their strategies. So it
is not surprising that many of the laggards - plus some which should know
better - are now making a similar mistake over the sort of organisational
changes they need to achieve their global strategies.
The necessary changes include the re-design of structures, procedures,
management career paths and, in most cases, the very tricky matter of
organisational culture.
On the structural front, the key internal question - as distinct from
external ones such as how to manage alliances - has been how best to alter
the roles, and power balance, between three types of executive: global
business (or 'divisional') managers; national (or 'country') managers; and
functional (such as production) managers .
As far as career paths and culture are concerned, the much-hyped question
for most companies over the last few years has been how to breed 'global
managers', or at least executives with what has become known in academic and
consultancy jargon as a 'global mindset'.
Underlying both questions has been the universal need to streamline (or
abandon) messy matrix structures in which power was shared - or, more often,
fought over - between divisional, national and functional managers. In most
multinationals, this traditional arrangement slowed decision-making and
sustained (or created) whole tiers of costly head office jobs - both at the
corporate centre and in each business. In today's competitive international
environment, greater speed, leanness and cost-effectiveness are essential.
As a result, most companies which want to 'go global' are swinging the
balance of managerial power firmly towards the global divisional (or
business) manager, and away from the national and functional managers. At
ICI, Britain's leading chemicals group, and countless other companies, the
divisions have been declared 'prime'. Once-mighty national managers have
lost much of their power, as have - to varying degrees - the functional
managers.
Where a company makes standard, commodity products which really are global,
or speciality items where the demands of customers vary only slightly
between countries or regions, a stark arrangement of this kind may be
sensible. But in most cases such an all-out drive for global efficiency
takes too little account of the need to retain responsiveness to national
differences, or even to increase it. The 'global first' approach also
underplays the need to transfer skills and learning between national and
product markets.
But how can one accomplish both these things without recreating a ponderous
formal matrix, or - in the words of a now fashionable refrain within
multinationals - retraining almost every manager to 'think global, but act
local'?
The answer is to do neither, according to two of the most influential
academics in the field of international organisation, Christopher Bartlett
and Sumantra Ghoshal. Nor is it to relegate once-star country managers and
functional executives to bit-parts.
Instead, the answer is twofold, they argue in the latest issue of the
Harvard Business Review*:
to get away from the idea that there can be any such thing as a universal
'global manager', and instead to breed specialists of all three types:
country; functional; and global business (or divisional).
and to confine to the upper part of the organisation most of the
complexities and internal conflicts of balancing global, regional and local
requirements. While top managers and some senior executives should operate
in a sort of matrix - or preferably in a more flexible 'network' - those
lower down should have clear, single-line, responsibilities, performance
measurements and reporting relationships.
One benefit of this arrangement, say the academics, is that most companies
will need relatively few really 'transnational' managers to implement their
cross-border strategies. This is an important consideration since people
with the necessary qualities are in short supply.
Floris Maljers, the co-chairman of Unilever, says it is this shortage,
rather than one of capital or any other resource, which has become the
biggest constraint in most efforts at globalisation. Maljers has an article
in the same issue of HBR about his company's experience.
Outlining the roles and characteristics of their three types of 'global
manager', Bartlett and Ghoshal draw on the experience of executives in
various companies, especially Electrolux, NEC, and Procter &amp; Gamble, as well
as Unilever.
The academics say there are three roles at the heart of a global business
manager's job: strategist for his or her organisation; architect of its
worldwide 'asset and resource configuration'; and co-ordinator of
international transactions.
Country managers, by contrast, 'play the pivotal role not only in meeting
local customer needs, but also in satisfying the host government's
requirements and defending their company's market positions against local
and external competitors'. In other words, country managers should be much
more than the ambassadorial ciphers to which many have been reduced.
Even more than country managers, functional executives have sunk to bit-part
status in many multinationals. The academics use graphic language to
describe the waste involved: 'relegated to support-staff roles, excluded
from important meetings, and even dismissed as unnecessary overhead,
functional managers are often given little chance to participate in, let
alone contribute to, the global activity of the corporate mainstream. In
some cases, top management has allowed staff functions to become a warehouse
for corporate misfits or a graveyard for managerial has-beens.
'Yet, at a time when information, knowledge and expertise have become ever
more specialised, an organisation can gain huge benefits by linking its
technical, manufacturing, marketing, human resources, and financial experts
worldwide". In sophisticated transnationals, senior functional executives
serve as linchpins in the process of worldwide learning, connecting their
areas of specialisation throughout the organisation.
Bartlett and Ghoshal advocate some rotation between their three types of
global specialist, whether through long-term appointments or membership of
temporary teams and task forces. Unilever does both. The academics underplay
the need for the relative power of the three types of manager to vary by
industry, business and product line. But otherwise they provide invaluable
advice on how to perform the ultimate organisational balancing act: reaping
the benefits of global scale without losing innovation sparked by national
differences - both in the marketplace and within the company.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Janet Langdon, who takes up her position as director of the Water Services
Association this month, says one of the attractions of the job was that 'I
wanted to do something different - and water is so important in people's
lives.'
Langdon, 52, joins at a high-profile time for the WSA, which represents the
10 large publicly quoted water and sewerage companies in England and Wales.
The companies are engaged in a tough debate with Ofwat, their financial
regulator, the National Rivers Authority, the water standards watchdog, and
the EC Environment Council about whether some water standards directives are
unnecessarily and expensively high.
She will become director at the end of the month when the WSA's secretary,
Michael Carney retires. Widely travelled in developing countries, she will
spend the next few months crossing the UK to visit WSA members.
Langdon, who has lectured in chemistry at Wellesley College, Massachusetts,
was previously director of the export division of GEC Alsthom, and has also
worked at Shell, the National Economic Development Office and Distillers.
She says 'one of my hobby-horses has been government-industry relations';
while at Shell she was seconded to the DTI.
Three years down the road from privatisation, the companies are increasingly
diverging in investment, financing and diversification plans. She says
'obviously you are not going to get a consensus,' and adds, 'coming from the
private sector I look on them as independent companies'.

A feature of the gasholders will be the specialist equipment used for
collecting and recycling gases to harness energy which is currently being
wasted via flare stack burn-off. The scheme is designed to collect, boost
and blend the gases, using two giant fans. This provides a mixture of a
virtually constant calorific value for use in other plant facilities.

Now that MIDLAND BANK is a subsidiary of the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Group, its board is beginning to contract to fit along familiar lines in
wholly-owned companies.
Three non-executives - Sir Peter Leslie, deputy chairman, Jefferson
Cunningham, and Sir Eric Pountain - left the Midland board last week. Sir
Peter is to be replaced as deputy chairman by Geoffrey Maitland Smith
(left), chairman of Sears, and a Midland director since 1986. Charles McKay
(right), chief executive of Inchcape, joins the board as a non-execu tive
director on November 12.
The most significant appointment, however, is that of John Strickland,
executive director of HSBC Holdings and the head of information technology
in the group, as a Midland director from next January. Strickland is the
architect of Hongkong Bank's world famous computer system which is reckoned
to be among the most effective to be found anywhere.
His place on the board will presumably help him to carry out his pledge to
integrate Midland's systems with those of its new parent group over the next
five years, cutting costs and staff while making a drastic improvement in
operating efficiency.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Economics: Input prices hang on sterling's fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first impact of sterling's devaluation on prices should show up in this
week's input price index for materials and fuel used by UK manufacturers.
In August, input prices declined by 1.9 per cent, mainly reflecting an
exceptional fall in the price of food manufacturing materials and weaker
petroleum products prices.
However, sterling has fallen sharply against both the dollar and the D-Mark
since September 16, when the UK abandoned the European exchange rate
mechanism. Oil prices were higher in dollar terms anyway in September, and
sterling's drop against the US currency will have compounded the effect.
Other indicators on the UK economy include manufacturing output which was
flat in July after a small rise in June. Recent surveys by the Confederation
of British Industry suggest that output remained weak in August. This is
reflected in the consensus forecast of a 0.3 per cent fall for the month.
Unemployment figures are also unlikely to cheer the government. Having risen
by 47,000 in August, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit
is forecast to have risen another 38,000 in September.
The following are some of the other economic highlights of the week with the
median of economists' forecasts in brackets from MMS International, a
financial information company.

Results due
LUCAS Industries, the UK-based engineering group, should produce a trading
profit of Pounds 20m when it announces preliminary profits today before an
exceptional gain of Pounds 90m from its pension fund refund. The group is,
however, expected to announce exceptional restructuring provisions of Pounds
60m. The group should maintain its dividend.
Body Shop International will try tomorrow to repair some of the damage done
to its share price by last month's profits warning. Bringing to an abrupt
halt a record of unbroken profits growth, the cosmetics retailer said
interim pre-tax profits would be not less than Pounds 8m (Pounds 9.1m) and
the 0.68p dividend would be maintained.
The shares fell 108p to 158p on the news and so far have only recovered to
170p. Investors will be anxious to hear how UK sales are going. Body Shop
said last month that some store sales were down between 3 and 5 per cent
over the past three months.
Who will end up as owner of Mirror Group Newspapers remains unresolved
nearly a year after the death of Robert Maxwell but the business is still
performing well.
Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 18m
for the half year. When the results are announced tomorrow all the signs are
that the actual performance will be at the upper end of the range.
Highland Distilleries, maker of The Famous Grouse, the second best-selling
Scotch whisky in the UK, is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits
today virtually unchanged from last year's Pounds 28m.
Famous Grouse, which suffered from the 12 per cent decline in the UK market
in the first half, may have benefited since then from price increases and a
gain in market share. Export growth is likely to have been modest, however,
and sales of new whisky fillings have been hit by lower demand and softer
prices.
Lloyds Chemists, the second-largest chain of retail chemists after Boots, is
expected to report on Thursday pre-tax profits for the year to June of about
Pounds 35m. The rise from Pounds 20.8m a year earlier reflects in large part
the group's ambitious acquisitions programme.
Attwoods, the international waste management company, is likely to report
pre-tax profits of Pounds 41m on Friday, a sharp drop in earnings after last
October's heavily discounted rights issue. Business is slow in its
south-eastern US market.

FT  12 OCT 92 / High-flyers meet altitude restriction: The changing job
prospects for the trainee with a new degree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH-FLYING graduate trainees as traditionally understood are an endangered
species. The future looks likely to see them, already hit hard by the
recession, forced into accepting jobs traditionally considered beneath their
skills and expectations.
Graduates are likely to continue to find jobs more easily than other groups.
Recent figures from the Institute of Manpower Studies show that unemployment
among new gradu-ates is more than 10 per cent. However, unemployment among
all graduates, rather than just last year's crop, is 4.4 per cent.
That is substantially lower than the 9.9 per cent of the whole of Britain's
population of working age who are now jobless, according to the Department
of Employment, and a fraction of the rate for those without any
qualifications. It is less clear, however, what kinds of jobs they can
expect for all the hours of studying.
Mr Geoff Pike, research fellow at the IMS, says graduates are going to have
to get used to working for smaller companies. Small and medium-sized
companies, operating in local or regional markets, many of which have
traditionally been sceptical of the worth of graduates, are likely to take a
higher proportion of graduates over the next decade.
This means that graduates will have to work in jobs that they might have
seen as being beneath them. However, when occupations become 'graduatised'
their status goes up, as in the case of posts in personnel.
Mr Matthew Farrow, training policy adviser at the Confederation of British
Industry, says: 'Graduates may have to accept jobs lower down the hierarchy
than they traditionally expected. But a degree will continue to advance
their careers in the long run.'
Mr Pike believes that even that view may be over-optimistic, as it neglects
the long-term threat to glittering graduate careers posed by the
government's planned expansion of higher education.
If there are thousands more students, he argues, many more graduates will be
black and working-class; many more will be mature students. Already this
year for the first time more than half of new students are women.
That means that employers will no longer be able to rely on a homogeneous
pool of applicants for graduate posts. Mr Pike argues that some employers
may downgrade the types of job available for graduates.
However, he says, even if the wider band of graduates is unlikely to get to
the top as quickly as previous cohorts, they will continue to find jobs
comparatively easily, especially in relation to their non-graduate
contemporaries, as employers are likely to expand the number of the posts
available to graduates.
Mr Julian Drury, British Rail's recruitment and assessment manager,
responsible for hiring between 150 and 200 graduates for the rail network,
says: 'There are certainly some firms which definitely look for white, male,
well-groomed, well-spoken young graduates. These companies may find things
more difficult, but they are quite a small minority.'
He welcomes a more diverse graduate population and says it will make his job
easier. British Rail has had to make efforts to recruit from groups - such
as ethnic minorities - that tend to be disadvantaged in the labour market.
Mr Farrow believes that today's employers recognise the costs of prejudice:
'Firms are realising that it's the skills that count rather than anything
else.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / New technology for old pictures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hulton Deutsch picture library, one of the largest in the world, with
more than 13m images, is moving to the latest CD-Rom technology.
The company, bought from the BBC in 1988 by Mr Brian Deutsch, a former cable
television operator, published People, its first CD-Rom, this week. A single
disc, the size of a conventional music compact disc, contains 10,000 images.
The disc, used with a personal computer, is designed for researchers,
picture editors and advertising agencies, who can call up a name and see
thumbnail pictures with references and captions.
The aim is to speed up picture research and the ordering of pictures, which
can then be delivered within 24 hours. A second CD of pictures from the
1930s is now in preparation. Each CD costs Pounds 350.
Mr Deutsch has recently raised Pounds 5m from a syndicate of investors led
by CINVen, the venture-capital group, which has taken a 35 per cent stake in
the company.
The library was created by Edward Hulton, publisher of Picture Post
magazine, and was owned by the BBC between 1958 and 1988. Many early
collections have been added and since Mr Deutsch acquired it, the Keystone,
Fox and Central Press News archives have been added.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Left group backs student loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE for Public Policy Research, a leftwing think tank, has
proposed moving further towards student loans and means-tested fees to
finance expansion in higher education.
The Labour party has hitherto opposed student loans and charges for higher
education, but the think tank says the present system of student finance
'supports the wealthiest young people in society at the expense of the
majority'. However, it says that the government's current loan scheme
achieves the worst of all worlds: it deters students and fails to raise
revenue.
It says that the primary constraint on expanding higher education is the
cost to government, and proposes that any reform of student funding should
raise revenue while distributing costs more fairly.
The report says students should be funded through loans paid back through
the tax system when they earn above the national average.
Other proposals include modularised courses to increase choice and
flexibility; a two-semester academic year; and separate funding for teaching
and research.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Graduate joblessness set to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRADUATE unemployment has more than doubled since 1989, according to the
Institute of Manpower Studies.
In its annual review, the institute found that more than 10 per cent of
those who graduated last year were still unemployed six months after
completing their degrees, compared with 5 per cent in 1989.
The survey suggests that the unemployment rate among new graduates will
continue to rise next year and possibly in 1994, even if 'over-optimistic'
forecasts for economic recovery are borne out.
Social science and business studies graduates experienced the lowest rates
of unemployment last year, with humanities and maths graduates struggling
hardest to find work. Traditionally the lowest unemployment rate has been
among graduates in engineering and technology.
The study suggests that graduate salaries will not keep pace with inflation.
The median graduate starting salary is expected to increase by only 3.3 per
cent this year to Pounds 12,915.
The median salary for graduates with one year's experience is Pounds 13,500,
some 8 per cent higher than that for new graduates. Similarly, the median
salary for graduates with three years' experience is Pounds 16,500, or 32
per cent higher than the figure for new recruits.
The study shows that fewer than 24 per cent of new graduates found work in
the service sector in 1980. That figure peaked at 35 per cent in 1988 before
falling to less than 30 per cent as the service sector shrank. More than 30
per cent of new graduates now find jobs in industry, a slight decline on the
figure for 1980.
The proportion of graduates who say they are not available for work, 5.8 per
cent, has more than doubled since 1980, when the figure was 2.3 per cent.
The report says that is partly due to the number of graduates who have
dependants or are taking time off.
The survey confirms that mature students face disadvantages, mainly because
they perform badly in selection tests designed for traditional graduates as
employers seek, for example, to identify 'long-term potential' and
'ambition'.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Dish shortage curbs satellite installations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORTAGE of satellite dishes is slowing the growth of satellite television
in the important autumn season, Raymond Snoddy writes.
A survey of independent retailers by Continental Research, the independent
market research company, found that 78 per cent of outlets were experiencing
stock shortages, although supplies were now starting to improve.
Continental believes the shortage was a factor in a decline in installations
last month.
The FT Satellite Monitor shows that in September an estimated 61,000 new
dishes were installed, compared with 73,000 in August. There were 65,000
installations in September last year.

Iraqi Kurds attacked ridges guarding the last bastion of Turkish separatist

guerrillas crept up rocky heights which command entry to the Hakurk valley,
where Turkey's Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has its military command. The
assault, which could take several days, was the climax of a week-old
offensive to drive the PKK from their bases in northern Iraq.

Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto led an opposition boycott of
the parliament's lower house yesterday after clashing with the government
over an alleged attempt to kill her last month, Reuter reports from
Islamabad. Ms Bhutto and other deputies of her People's Democratic Alliance
(PDA) marched out of the house after Gohar Ayub Khan, the National Assembly
speaker, gave short shrift to their accusations.
On Saturday, a court acquitted Ms Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari of
masterminding the murder of 29 people. Prison officials said Mr Zardari,
arrested in October 1990, was still being held to face other charges,
although this acquittal was his fifth so far.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Lebanon completes poll for deputies

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEBANON yesterday completed its first parliamentary elections in 20 years
with a by-election that was boycotted by a majority of voters.
The turnout at elections in Kesrouan, the coastal strip north of Beirut, was
estimated at less than 15 per cent.
Mr Nasrallah Sfeir, the Maronite patriarch, and a coalition of right-wing
Maronite Catholics, had called on the 80,000 registered voters to boycott
the poll. While most Christian Maronite voters backed the call, the extent
of the boycott is unclear.
The five winning candidates will join the 128-member parliament when it
convenes for the first time on Friday.
Ten thousand Lebanese army troops and police were despatched to Kesrouan to
ensure security during the vote. They manned checkpoints at all main
intersections and searched cars for weapons.
Advocates of the boycott claim the newly-elected parliament has no
legitimacy while 35,000 Syrian troops remain in Lebanon. The Lebanese
Opposition Front, established last week, is demanding the dissolution of the
legislature. Those who took part in the election pointed out there are no
Syrian troops in Kesrouan.
Three of the Opposition Front's four Maronite leaders, including the rebel
general Michel Aoun, live in France. Much of Kesrouan was bombarded by Gen
Aoun's forces in the inter-Christian war he started in 1990, but the exiled
officer is popular here.
The region is the seat of the Maronite patriarchate and is regarded by many
Maronites as the heart of Lebanon. The Kesrouan parliamentary elections,
which were originally scheduled for August 30, were postponed when all
candidates withdrew.
The participation of 24 candidates in yesterday's poll was a blow to the
prestige of the patriarch.
The mountain village of Raifoun is home both to Patriarch Sfeir and one of
the more prominent candidates, his cousin, Mr Henri Sfeir. Mr Sfeir resisted
pressure from his clan and the church to renounce his candidacy.
'People here are torn between allegiance to the church and political
pragmatism,' said a brother of the candidate. 'How can we make our voice
heard if we have no seats in parliament?'
In an election based on feudal family loyalties, the list led by Mr Fares
Bweiz, the former foreign minister, appeared likely to win most of the five
seats.

<TEXT>
CAMEROON'S main opposition leader alleged widespread fraud in yesterday's
first multi-candidate presidential election, but said he still expected to
win, Reuter reports from Yaounde. President Paul Biya's strongest
challenger, Mr John Fru Ndi, claimed the government had stuffed ballot
boxes, altered electoral lists and distributed inadequate ballot papers for
the opposition.
The government-controlled radio did not report fraud but serious
organisational problems were observed at polling stations in the capital,
Yaounde, the northern city of Garoua and some other centres. Numerous
problems with electoral lists and ballot papers delayed the start of voting.
The second main opposition candidate, Mr Bello Bouba Maigari, said the
voting had been 'badly organised'. A prominent member of Mr Biya's ruling
Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) described the organisation in
Garoua as perfect. Reports that the Douala-based opposition politician, Mr
Jean-Jacques Ekindi, had withdrawn from the race, reducing the number of
candidates to five, were denied. But Mr Ekindi's ballot papers were not
distributed in several Douala polling stations.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Palestinians suspend hunger strike: Israeli minister agrees
to investigate prison conditions

PALESTINIAN prisoners yesterday suspended a two-week-long hunger strike
which prompted widespread unrest in the occupied territories and raised
fears that the issue could disrupt Middle East peace talks, which are due to
resume in Washington on October 21.
Many of the 12,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails had been
carrying out the fast in protest at prison conditions. Last night a
Palestinian lawyer representing the hunger strikers said agreement had been
reached with the prisons authority to investigate conditions and the hunger
strike would be suspended for one week while the agreement was implemented.
Inmates of three prisons were reported to be continuing their fast until
tomorrow when the investigation, ordered by police minister Moshe Shahal,
begins.
Earlier, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said during a visit to
the occupied Gaza Strip that Israeli troops would use 'all our strength' to
suppress unrest sparked by the hunger strike.
'The Palestinians must understand that the solution to their problems will
be around the negotiating table and not in the streets and alleyways of the
(occupied) territories.'
At least two Palestinians, including a 14-year-old boy, were reported killed
and more than 100 injured over the weekend in widespread clashes with the
security forces in the West Bank and Gaza. Yesterday, an Israeli civilian
working at a Jewish settlement in Gaza was killed by a Palestinian farm
worker.
Israeli officials expressed concern that the unrest marked a resurgence of
the five-year-old intifada, or uprising, in the occupied territories. They
accused Palestinian leaders of fomenting disturbances to disrupt the peace
talks.
Palestinians said the demonstrations were an expression of frustration that
the year-old peace talks had so far yielded nothing to ease the conditions
of the Israeli occupation.

US bomb disposal expert Chad Hall, arrested by Iraqi security forces on the
disputed Kuwaiti border, returned to Kuwait yesterday under UN escort,
Reuter reports from Kuwait.
UN officials handed Mr Hall to US ambassador Edward Gnehm at Kuwait City
airport and he was driven to the US embassy. Mr Hall earlier arrived under
UN escort at Umm Qasr, near the frontier, where he was given medical checks.
An official said: 'He looked pretty healthy to me.'
Mr Hall, hired to clear ordnance left over from the 1991 Gulf War, was
arrested by the Iraqis at gunpoint on Thursday as he was working with two
Pakistani colleagues. The UN said he was arrested at least 1km inside
Kuwait.
Iraq freed Mr Hall to UN custody on Saturday. It was in marked contrast to
the harsh treatment meted out to other foreigners detained on the Kuwaiti
frontier or in northern Iraq since the Gulf War ended last February.
Mr Hall, a retired US Army major, was taken at gunpoint by Iraqi security
police after an argument over whether he and two Pakistani workers were
working in Kuwait or Iraq. The territory had belonged to Iraq until May,
when a UN commission redefined the border. Baghdad has refused to recognise
the new boundary.
Baghdad announced Mr Hall's release on Saturday, carefully worded to avoid
an apology, but implicitly admitting a mistake over Mr Hall's detention.
Under Iraqi law, anyone entering the country without a visa can be jailed
for up to 20 years; several foreigners have been convicted after being
arrested near Iraqi borders.
Sweden is seeking retrials or pardons for three Swedish engineers jailed in
Iraq for seven years. Two Britons have been jailed for trespassing on Iraqi
territory.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Slow puncture of the Japanese real estate bubble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DETAILS of Britain's new economic policy remain shrouded in Treasury
mystique. But one clear message emerged in the chancellor's letter to the
Treasury and civil service select committee: the UK government will no
longer ignore the macroeconomic messages emerging from the housing market.
The chancellor intends to monitor a range of asset prices, 'paying
particular attention to periods when house prices are falling or
accelerating sharply'.
Of course, it is now a little late. The inflationary danger signals from
rapid house price inflation should have been spotted back in 1985 and 1986.
But during the subsequent two years interest rates were cut in an attempt to
prevent sterling from rising above DM3 rather than raised to rein in
property-related credit demand. By the time British interest rates were
increased to double figures, the house price bubble was already bloated and
ready to burst.
Nor was this a peculiarly British mistake. The bulk of Japan's asset price
inflation occurred in the period 1985-87, as the charts show. Yet the
Japanese monetary authorities cut the official discount rate in 1987 in an
attempt to stabilise the dollar's collapse, ignoring the inflationary
dangers that this large rise in property prices implied.
Yet movements in property prices can be destabilising when they are falling
as well as rising, as the chancellor's letter suggests. So what should the
current pattern of property prices be telling policymakers? The charts are
taken from the the September issue of the International Bank Credit Analyst.
They suggest that it is policymakers in Japan who should now be paying
particular attention.
The monetary authorities in the US, UK and Australia have all been watching
the deflationary impact of falling land prices for some time, and cutting
interest rates accordingly. Commercial prices peaked first in the US but
they have fallen furthest in the UK where interest rate cuts have so far
been relatively modest. But the plethora of empty commercial real estate in
the financial districts of Sydney, London and in many US cities are
testimony to the severity of the commercial real estate collapse that
continues to undermine bank balance sheets and restrict the availability of
new lending.
Consumers have also been hit by falling property prices. Nominal house
prices across southern England have fallen by more than 25 per cent since
the end of 1988, eroding the real value of household wealth. More than 1 in
10 UK homeowners with mortgages now owe more than their house is worth at
current prices. But the charts suggest that, relative to consumer prices,
house prices in the US, UK and Australia may still have some way to fall. UK
house prices are still high, relative to average earnings, and the low level
of housing transaction in the UK suggests that house prices may have to fall
further.
In Japan, however, the charts suggest that the bursting of the land price
bubble is only now getting under way. The rise in Japanese land prices was
so extreme, and transactions in the land market have since dried up to such
an extent that, after falling between 20 and 40 per cent from their peak,
land prices remain at unrealistically high levels.
The problem for Japan's policymakers is that neither the Bank of Japan nor
the commercial banks know how far prices would have to fall before the
adjustment is over. Some commercial bankers talk of further falls of 30 per
cent in real estate prices, estimates that Bank of Japan officials describe
as highly plausible.
Yet the evidence from the US, UK and Australia suggests that prices may have
to fall twice as far as these estimates suggest. If prices do finally fall
far enough for speculators to re-enter the market, the real estate losses
for Japan's banks will be much higher than the Y7,800bn (Pounds 36.4bn) of
non-performing loans that the Ministry of Finance reported last March or the
Y15,000bn which commercial bankers estimate the ministry's latest study will
reveal. For Japan's banking industry, the domestic pain is still to come.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY and four Arab countries yesterday approved a plan to link their
electricity networks by 1997, Reuter reports from Damascus.
Electricity and industry ministers of Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt
signed an agreement after two days of talks in Damascus. The first stage of
the project costing Dollars 185m (Pounds 103.9m) will be financed by the
Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, whose
director-general, Mr Abdullatif al-Hamad, attended the talks.
The project was first endorsed by the five states in 1989. The meeting also
approved a feasibility study prepared by a consortium of Canadian companies.
Turkey's energy minister, Mr Ersin Faralyali, said the linked grid would
serve 150m people.
Syria's electricity minister, Mr Kamel al-Baba, said the project should be a
first stage towards connecting the five states with Gulf Arab countries and
linking these with Europe through Turkey. Maghreb Arab countries should be
linked with the five through Egypt, and other African states could also join
the network, he added.
Egypt's electricity minister, Mr Maher Abaza, said work was under way on a
project to link the electricity networks of Egypt and Jordan, expected to be
completed in 1995.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Persecuted Indians attack ghost of Columbus: Latin American
groups find nothing to celebrate 500 years after explorer's arrival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTOPHER Columbus would not have approved. The anniversary of his arrival
in the New World 500 years ago today has been expropriated by the very
Indians whose subjugation followed his arrival. Celebrations have turned
into protests by Indian groups at the miserable conditions and
discrimination under which they live.
Indian activists in Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico
have staged street marches. In Nicaragua, indigenous groups from 24
countries are converging for a conference: 500 years of indigenous
resistance, black and popular.
'There is nothing to celebrate,' says Ms Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan
Indian and human rights activist leading the conference. 'The rights of the
Indian peoples continue to be violated,' says Ms Menchu, a candidate for
this year's Nobel peace prize.
Latin nations, faced with the choice between celebrating with Spain and
Portugal or sympathising with oppressed indigenous groups, have chosen the
latter, or stayed silent. One hundred years ago, the same creole elites
ruling the continent faced no such inhibitions: the Guatemalan government
forced 20,000 Indians to march through the capital to celebrate the 400th
anniversary of Columbus' arrival.
In Mexico, while the government has been virtually silent, hundreds of
Indians have converged on Mexico City, where they will gather today in the
capital's central square. Genero Dominguez, an indigenous activist on hunger
strike there, says the campaign is to 'remind the world of the crimes
committed against us in the name of progress and discovery'.
The mobilisation of indigenous groups across Latin America in part reflects
the repression and deterioration in living standards they suffered in the
1980s in particular.
Anti-Columbus campaigning has provided a focus for their concerns. 'Everyone
is talking about Indians,' says Mr Domingo Hernandez, a Guatemalan Indian in
exile in Mexico City. 'It is the first step in our fight to be recognised.'
In the cities of Mexico, Indians are 'poor, often extremely poor, and have
the lowest, most vulnerable, precarious conditions,' according to a
government report. Inevitably, their cultural identity is threatened: 'The
culture of the Maya is based on land, corn, the family and communal life.'
says Mr Domingo Hernandez, a Guatemalan Indian in exile in Mexico City.
'When you come to the cities this changes.'
Government policy across Latin America has systematically favoured urban
over rural areas where the majority of indigenous peoples live. Some 70 per
cent of Mexico's 8m Indians live in rural areas. Even in the countryside,
the Indians are the poorest: 97 per cent of Mexico's rural Indians live in
'impoverished' counties, against 23 per cent of rural Mexicans in general.
No one knows the exact number of Indians killed in land disputes or by
security forces in the 1980s, but Amnesty International concluded in a
report released last week that mass killings may have reduced in scale in
the past 500 years, but 'they have never stopped.' In Guatemala alone tens
of thousands of Indians were murdered in the 1980s by state security forces
in the campaign to eliminate leftist insurgency groups.
Those celebrating the quincentenary appear slightly embarrassed. In the
Dominican Republic, a visit by the Pope threatened to become a public
relations disaster. He was to have inaugurated the light-house on land
Colombus first spotted, but the Vatican became embarrassed at criticism that
it would take a large slice of the country's electricity and infrastructure
spending. The lighthouse was opened last week before the Pope arrived.
The discrimination, and poverty in which most Indians live means it will
take time before any new concern leads to results. Mr Guillermo Espinosa,
head of Mexico's National Indigenous Institute warns: 'The indigenous
peoples will keep on protesting, but I am very sceptical the general public
will change their opinion. There may now be a sentimental reaction but there
is not an analytical or objective understanding of their plight.'

FT  12 OCT 92 / Congress likely to back radical economic change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SENIOR leadership of the Communist party of China gathers in Beijing
today for a week-long congress which is expected to endorse radical plans
for economic change but balance evenly the forces of conservatism and reform
at the top of the party.
China's 'open door policy' to foreign investment and the country's
continuing engagement with the rest of the world is expected to gain the
full approval of the congress. It is also likely to endorse further industry
and price reforms, and proclaim the creation of a 'socialist market economy'
as one of its key tasks.
Congresses of the Chinese Communist party are, however, as much about policy
as they are about jobs. Diplomats in Beijing expect the party to retain
Jiang Zemin as its general secretary and titular head, and also to retain Li
Peng as prime minister. Li's re-appointment is not expected to be confirmed
until positions in a new Chinese cabinet are announced next spring.
Neither reappointment is what Deng Xiaoping, China's 88-year-old leader,
sought when he embarked on a campaign of reform at the beginning of the
year. However, analysts said, Deng was forced to accept their reappointment
during a round of intense horse trading among the country's gerontocracy.
The congress will elect a new central committee for the Communist party. One
of its first tasks at the end of the congress will be to elect the politburo
and its all-powerful standing committee.
Zhu Rongji, 63, China's industry chief and a leading economic reformer, is
expected to be appointed to the politburo but it is unclear whether he will
make the standing committee. Zou Jiahua, 65, head of state planning and
moderate, is also expected to enter the politburo as is Hu Jintao, 50, a
possible reformer and the current party secretary for Tibet.
On the military front, General Liu Huaquing, 76, is expected to be appointed
to both the politburo and its standing committee. Recently, he was made
first vice-chairman of the Military Affairs Commission - the organ which
controls China's People's Liberation Army.
The congress will, however, mark the passing of an institution erected more
than 10 years ago for the party's ageing senior membership. The Central
Advisory Commission, numbering more than 100 souls, and chaired by Deng's
ideological rival Chen Yun, 87, will be shut down.
At a briefing yesterday, a foreign ministry spokesman said that there was a
motion on the Congress's agenda for it to be disbanded and that no elections
would take place for this body.
Deng looms over this, the 14th congress of the party since its founding in
1921. Although he has accepted an invitation to attend he is not expected to
do so. Diplomats in Beijing believe that the effort he put in to relighting
the fires of economic reform earlier this year have affected his health.
Some think he is is seriously ill.
His name, however, will be enshrined in party documents - which may possibly
making him an equal of Mao Zedong, the nation's revolutionary leader and
unifier - and his daughter, Deng Nan, a scientist, may well be elected to
the central committee.

FT  12 OCT 92 / US reaches trade pact with China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and China over the weekend signed a pact designed to open China's
markets to foreign goods, thus averting billions of dollars in trade
sanctions threatened by both sides.
The agreement is a major triumph for Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade
representative. Since bringing a US Section 301 case against China a year
ago, Mrs Hills has applied steady pressure on Beijing, ultimately using as a
threat a potential retaliation list totalling Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2.2bn)
in Chinese exports to the US.
At the same time, she dangled as bait US support for China's long-sought
membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). She
resisted congressional pressure to take the lead in pushing for Taiwanese
membership in the Gatt ahead of China's.
In the pact with China, Beijing agreed to phase out 75 per cent of its
import licences, quotas and non-tariff barriers within two years. It also
agreed to publish its secret trade rules, quotas, and technical standards,
all of which have been used to discourage imports.
China's trade surplus with the US this year could rise to Dollars 17bn, but
US officials say the new pact prepares the ground for increased US exports
of computers, machinery, chemicals, telecommunications equipment, motor
parts and farm products.
China's Foreign Ministry has summoned Mr Stapleton Roy, the US Ambassador to
China, to protest against Washington's support for Hong Kong autonomy after
the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, an official report said
yesterday, according to AP in Beijing.
Vice-foreign minister Liu Huaqiu summoned Mr Roy to lodge a protest against
the Hong Kong policy act, signed recently by President Bush.

SERBS yesterday voted in a referendum on whether to hold early elections -
the outcome of which will play an important role in determining whether
United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia will be lifted.
Confusion yesterday appeared to grip Belgrade, the Serbian capital, because
many people were uncertain whether to vote in the snap referendum called by
Serbia's ruling Socialists under the control of Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic.
Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav federal prime minister, and Mr Dobrica Cosic,
the president of Yugoslavia, both favour early elections to get rid of Mr
Milosevic, who is seen by the international community as most responsible
for the war in Bosnia.
Yesterday Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, and peace
negotiators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen said in Moscow that UN sanctions
could be lifted if Mr Panic gained the upper hand against hardline Serbs.
They also indicated sanctions might be eased to help people survive the
winter.
Mr Kozyrev said: 'We discussed the possibility of some lowering of sanctions
against Yugoslavia in connection with the coming winter, first of all to
ease the humanitarian situation.'
If the referendum fails, Mr Milosevic could remain in office for three more
years.
The Socialists called the referendum in the belief it would fail and enable
them to remain in power. The rules require a majority of registered voters
to vote Yes. This was unlikely after Serbian television, under Mr
Milosevic's control, had denied publicity to the referendum. Turnout was
reported to be moderate.

SERB military aircraft at the weekend defied a United Nations ban on
military flights over Bosnia, bombarding two Bosnian strongholds in the
north of the former Yugoslav republic.
The air strike took place during a Moslem and Croat counter-offensive to
close the Serb corridor through Bosnia.
A UN resolution creating a no-fly zone over Bosnia, agreed by the Security
Council on Friday, envisages only the monitoring of flights but does not
authorise the use of force to punish violators.
Bosnian radio said 19 people were killed on Saturday in a Serb bombardment
of Gradacac, one of the two strongholds. It said Serb aircraft took off from
Banja Luka, in north-west Bosnia, the military headquarters of the
self-proclaimed Serb Republic.
Bosnian Serb leaders attending peace talks in Geneva at the weekend said
their aircraft were grounded in Banja Luka, dismissing the reports of
bombardment as propaganda in an attempt to force foreign military
intervention in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Serbian commanders on the ground said
Bosnian reinforcements had crossed over the River Sava from Croatia into
Brcko.
Bosnian forces on Saturday cut through the Serb corridor which runs
east-west across northern Bosnia, from Banja Luka to the Serb border in the
east. Lorries, buses and cars waited near Brcko for Serb forces to
re-establish control over the corridor.
Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslav prime minister, has asked for the despatch of
international monitors to airports in Serbia, Montenegro and Banja Luka.
Reuters quoted diplomatic sources in Geneva yesterday as saying Croatia and
the rump Yugoslavia had reached agreement on allowing such observers at
their airfields.
Bosnian military leaders said yesterday they would pull out of UN-backed
talks on ending the siege of Sarajevo because Serb rebels were preventing
crews from restoring water and power to the city, AP reports from Sarajevo.
Military officials from the Moslem-led Bosnian government, the Bosnian
Croats and the rebelling Bosnian Serbs had agreed to meet in Sarajevo today
to discuss the demilitarisation of the city.
Meanwhile, the Red Cross in Sarejevo said it was trying to organise a convoy
to carry 3,000 women and children out of the city tomorrow.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ion Iliescu, Romania's president, looked to be heading for re-election
after yesterday's presidential election run-off against Mr Emil
Constantinescu. By 6pm 60 per cent of the 16.4m electorate had voted - a
turnout not far below that recorded in the election's first round on
September 27.
Political analysts had believed Mr Constantinescu could only score well if
urban voters and especially the young, many of whom did not vote in the
first round, turned out in higher numbers than rural voters.
Mr Iliescu, once a close aide to deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, emerged
a firm favourite after the first round in which he won 47 per cent of the
vote, 16 points more than Mr Constantinescu, his nearest rival.
He then outpolled Mr Constantinescu by 2-1 in the countryside where nearly
half of Romania's 23m inhabitants live.
The president, who this time needs only a simple majority to secure a
four-year second term, was also expected to pick up most of the 11 per cent
polled by Mr Gheorghe Funar, a anti-Hungarian nationalist, who finished
third in the first round of voting.
Mr Constantinescu, a university rector, refused to give up the fight in the
two weeks following September 27 but received little support from the
Democratic Convention (DC), the loose coalition of 18 reform-minded
opposition parties which nominated him for president.
Instead, many DC leaders admitted openly that Mr Constantinescu, a hitherto
unknown academic, had no chance of beating Mr Iliescu, a skilled politician
whom many Romanians credit with engineering the overthrow of the Ceausescu
regime in December 1989.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, was expected to
win a legitimate mandate in yesterday's elections as Georgia's leader,
together with backing for his attempt to retrieve territory lost to
Abkhazian separatists in the north-west of the state.
Voting in the parliamentary elections in Georgia and for the post of
parliamentary leader, for which Mr Shevardnadze, who led the Georgian
Communist party until 1985, is the only candidate, went off generally
peacefully in the republic yesterday. However towns in the autonomous
republic of Abkhazia controlled by separatist forces and their north
Caucasian allies boycotted the vote.
A heavy turnout was reported by the Central Election Commission in the
capital of Tblisi, with nearly half of the registered voters casting their
votes by midday. In the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi, controlled by Georgian
forces but surrounded by Abkhazian forces, half of the vote was reported to
have turned out by one o'clock.
No single party or bloc of parties is expected to control the post-election
parliament, since polls report that the main blocs among more than 30 vying
for seats all have support of about 12 to 15 per cent. Because of fears of
electing a president who usurps effective power - as Mr Zviad Gamsakurdia,
the previous elected president ousted last December, is held to have done -
Mr Shevardnadze will be elected by the entire electorate and must find
support within parliament, almost certainly by putting together a coalition
of parties.
Mr Shevardnadze on Saturday pledged that he would recapture the areas of
Abkhazia taken from Georgian troops earlier this month. Mr Tenghiz
Khitovani, the Georgian defence minister yesterday blamed 'treason' by
commanders and servicemen in deserting their posts in Gagra, the northern
town captured by Abkhazians.
Talks between Mr Shevardnadze and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president
and Mr Vladislav Ardzimba, the Abkhazian leader were set for Tuesday - but
there are now doubts that they can take place.

BONN would like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, to attend
the memorial service in Berlin for Mr Willy Brandt, the former German
chancellor, in spite of a Russian ban on his leaving the country.
A government spokesman in Bonn confirmed the official attitude yesterday,
but insisted that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had taken no initiative to persuade
the Russian government to allow Mr Gorbachev to leave the country for the
occasion.
Unofficial reports said the German chancellor was 'greatly concerned' about
the travel ban on the former Soviet leader, and had instructed his officials
to do what they could to have it changed.
Bild am Sonntag, the mass-circulation Sunday newspaper, said Mr Kohl had
told his staff: 'We must do something. If he is not allowed to come, it
would be a scandal.'
The German Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the report yesterday, but
a government spokesman said the government would welcome Mr Gorbachev's
attendance at the memorial service for Mr Brandt, scheduled for next
Saturday in Berlin.
He was unable to confirm whether Mr Gorbachev had already been officially
invited.
The travel ban was imposed on Mr Gorbachev after he refused to give evidence
before the Russian constitutional court into the activities of the Soviet
Communist party.

FT  12 OCT 92 / The European Market: Political worries fail to deter western
investors - Companies are flocking to get brands established before their
competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN multinational companies are maintaining the momentum of investment
in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, in spite of increasing
political anxieties in several countries. That is the main message emerging
from a survey* carried out by Creditanstalt, the Austrian Bank, and Business
International (now part of the Economist Intelligence Unit).
More than half of investor respondents - 54 per cent - report they are
increasing investments in the east European region. However, 17 per cent are
lowering their initial investment levels, above all in the former Soviet
Union and Yugoslavia. The main reasons for caution are economic and
political uncertainties, as well as difficulties surrounding the legal
systems in the former communist states.
Western businesses moving into eastern Europe are motivated above all by
desire to establish market share and gain low-cost production sites.
'Investors are flocking to eastern Europe to get their brands firmly
entrenched ahead of their competitors,' according to Mr Rene Gatling, author
of the study.
The review of 87 companies which have invested in eastern Europe or which
are considering this step shows the former Soviet Union is considered the
most difficult area for establishing a foothold. 'Cultural differences' with
the west are cited as a particular reason for difficulties.
'For many western companies, taking the plunge into the Soviet market is a
major risk,' says Mr Gatling.
However, 52 per cent of respondents say they are still considering
investments in the ex-Soviet republics, with only 22 per cent ruling this
out for the moment.
A majority of corporations - 57 per cent - believe Hungary has the easiest
investment procedures, because of its longer track record of openness to
western companies.
Hungary has attracted the bulk of capital investment and about 50 per cent
of acquisitions so far in the region. The country is estimated to have
attracted more than Dollars 4bn in western working capital.
The report points out that investors have varying perceptions of risk in
eastern Europe. US companies, for instance, pay hardly any attention to
potential problems posed by Hungary's political environment. Austrian and
German investors, however, see political risk as fifth in their list of
preoccupations about starting up there.
On the other hand, US investors appear much more worried than
Austrian/German companies about the political environment in Czechoslovakia.
US investors are also much more averse than companies from Austria and
Germany to giving employment guarantees to accompany their investment moves.
This reflects the relatively generous labour and employment protection laws
already in force in Austria and Germany.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Chance to avert currency crisis 'missed': Italian central
banker claims Bonn and Rome proposed general currency alignment last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE crisis on European foreign exchanges could have been avoided if EC
members had accepted a German-Italian proposal for a general currency
realignment last month, according to Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of
the Bank of Italy.
Mr Ciampi's comments, in an interview with the Financial Times, seem likely
to spark fresh controversy over the circumstances surrounding the lira's
devaluation on the weekend of September 12/13.
In particular, the statement may raise questions about Britain's refusal to
devalue sterling that weekend. The line was upheld by Mr Norman Lamont, UK
chancellor of the exchequer, at a secret 7.30am meeting at the Treasury with
his top monetary officials on Sunday, September 13.
Three days later, on 'Black Wednesday' - September 16 - Britain was forced
to suspend its membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) after heavy
international selling forced sterling below its D-Mark floor.
Mr Ciampi made clear that he was not directing his remarks against any
particular EC member. But he implied that Britain, as well as other weaker
currency countries, should have joined in the Italian devaluation a month
ago, as a means of defusing tension in the ERM.
He suggested that, if other countries had devalued along with the lira, the
Bundesbank would have increased the scale of its interest rate cuts  -
decided in principle on Saturday, September 12 and publicly announced after
a meeting of the Bundesbank council on September 14.
'The crisis which emerged last month could have been avoided if the member
states had grasped the opportunity provided by the German and Italian
proposal of September 12 for a general realignment, within the bounds set by
an appreciation of the D-Mark and an equal depreciation of the lira, coupled
with a decrease in interest rates in Germany,' Mr Ciampi said.
'Unfortunately, the realignment was limited to the lira/D-Mark exchange
rate, so that the accompanying reduction in German rates was only small.
This left plenty of scope for the market to mount further speculative
attacks against other currencies.'
The British government has denied receiving a request to join in any
devaluation as part of the ERM realignment deal worked out by Italy and
Germany. British officials reject the view that an Italian-German 'proposal'
for a wider realignment was on offer that weekend.
However, it has emerged that, during the September 13 meeting at the UK
Treasury, British officials briefly broached the possibility that sterling
could join in the Italian devaluation.
The issue was raised at the meeting by Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary
at the Treasury, as an option, according to UK officials. Any likelihood
that sterling would follow the lira by devaluing was, however, immediately
scotched by Mr Lamont.
The Treasury meeting came about 12 hours after the British government had
first heard of the Italian-German plan, in a series of telephone calls from
the continent. Mr Ciampi felt this was probably not the best way to persuade
other ERM members of the merits of a general realignment.
UK officials say the lira devaluation, including the accompanying Bundesbank
interest rate cuts, was presented as a fait accompli on Saturday evening.
Significantly, details of the Bundesbank's cuts - a 1/4 point reduction in
the Lombard rate, and  1/2 point declines in the Bundesbank's discount rate
and the key money market dealing rate - were communicated to Britain and
other EC partners that evening. The interest rate moves were not formally
decided by the Bundesbank council until the morning of September 14.
One senior UK official said the Italian-German deal was 'stitched up before
anyone else was given information about it'.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Surge in over-counter healthcare sales seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN sales of over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products are set to rise
by more than 15 per cent a year between 1990 and 1995, making it one of the
fastest growing retail sectors.
The increase will be partly driven by Europe's ageing population, which will
require more medicines, according to a report by Euromonitor, the
London-based market research company.
However, growth is also likely to be fuelled by EC governments switching
increasing numbers of prescription products - which are reimbursed by the
state - to OTC status. Since patients pay for OTC products, many health
ministries are adopting this strategy to control growing expenditure.
The fastest expanding OTC market will be France, with 28 per cent growth
projected over the five years to 1995, followed by Germany with 17 per cent.
Both countries are expected to switch the largest number of products to OTC
status.
The report argues that the OTC monopoly held by pharmacies in EC markets
such as France, Belgium, Italy and Spain is being eroded by mass market
outlets such as drug-stores and supermarkets.
European Commission measures to standardise sales of OTC products are likely
to be long and painful, it argues. European-wide mass distribution of OTC
products, as exists in the UK with groups such as Boots the Chemist, is not
on the horizon, it suggests.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Andalucia left to nurse a post-Expo hangover: The likely
regional impact of the world fair's closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Seville Expo '92 winds up today after receiving more than 40m visitors
over the past six months.
As the red carpet is unfurled for the last time for King Juan Carlos, the
frequent Expo visitor who will preside over an extravagant closing ceremony,
the immediate question is what Spain has achieved after investing about
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in the biggest world fair to date.
As Expo's promotors tell it, just about everything involved with the
exhibition deserves to be consigned to the Guinness Book of Records. There
were more national and corporate pavilions, at 98, than at any other similar
event and the exhibition grounds boasted the biggest car park, for 40,000
vehicles, anywhere.
They even say, although the figures are disputed, that Expo, managed by a
public company expressly created for the purpose, will break even. It is
hoped the books will be balanced by the resale of Expo's buildings to a
second ad-hoc public company designed to create a research and development
park on the fair's site.
What is left for Spain, and for Seville, after the party is over is more
difficult to assess.
The fate of Spain's first bullet train in the coming months might serve as
an indicator.
The high-speed train links Madrid and Seville and cuts rail travel time
between the two cities by more than half, to about two hours 40 minutes. It
was inaugurated just in time for Expo's opening in April and has operated at
full capacity for the past six months.
The problem is that up to three-quarters of the passengers boarding the
train were travelling to Expo. Now the show is over the biggest engineering
project undertaken in Spain is almost certain to incur considerable losses.
There is little money left to build a more economically rational high-speed
link between Madrid and Barcelona.
Seville was the 16th century boom town that grew fat on the gold and silver
brought back by those who followed Columbus to the New World. It declined
sharply when it lost its monopoly trading status and is now the capital of
Spain's southern belt of Andalucia, where per capita GDP stands at less than
60 per cent of the European Community's average.
Mr Emilio Casinello, who is tipped to be Spain's next ambassador to London
and has been Expo's tireless commissioner general, claims the isolation of
Seville and Andalucia is a thing of the past. 'There is no possibility of a
Spanish Mezzogiorno like in Italy now,' he says. 'There can be no dissection
between the north and south.'
He was referring to the billions of dollars that have been pumped into the
south in the form of roads, telecommunications, overhauled airports  - and
the high-speed train.
Mr Jacinto Pellon, Expo's chief executive, says: 'We have laid out the land
and we have planted the seeds. It is now up to Seville and Andalucia to
provide irrigation.'
However, the economic climate is not conducive to nurturing Expo's fruits.
And nobody now talks of Andalucia as the California of the United States of
Europe, as they did when work began on Expo in the booming 1980s.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Danes seek 'substantial'alterations to treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor, and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Danish government yesterday said it would not submit the Maastricht
treaty to a second referendum unless it offered 'substantial changes' which
took account of the concerns expressed by Danish voters when they rejected
the treaty last June, write Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor, and Hilary
Barnes in Copenhagen.
'We will not hold a second referendum on the same basis as before. I'm not
going to present the Danish voters with the same question, dressed up in
some fancy clothes,' Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an interview with Mr
Brian Walden of London Weekend Television.
Although the Danish foreign minister did not call for formal amendments to
the text, he stressed his government was looking for 'clarifications' of
matters of vital interest to Denmark which were already in the treaty.
In particular, Denmark, in common with other member states such as Britain
and Germany, wanted clarification of 'subsidiarity,' the principle that
decisions should only be taken by European Community institutions if their
objectives could not be as effectively achieved by national governments.
'You have to put flesh and blood on what is only a principle in the treaty.
We will have to lay down clear rules on how decisions are taken.'
The minister, who was speaking two days after his government had published a
white paper containing eight possible options which Denmark and its partners
could pursue to overcome the obstacles to ratification of the Maastricht
treaty, also said Denmark wanted some 'special deals' on specific issues.
Although he denied Denmark wanted to exclude sensitive matters such as
defence, education and health from the treaty, it wanted the principle of
subsidiarity to be applied to them in the form of opt-out clauses, of the
kind obtained by the UK for the social chapter of the treaty.
Another important issue on which Denmark wanted to reserve the right to opt
out was adoption of a single Community currency.
Meanwhile, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the Danish opposition Social
Democratic party (SDP), has tightened his party's conditions for supporting
special arrangements between Denmark and the other 11 EC members.
At a meeting of European Socialist parties in Brussels at the weekend he
stressed any special arrangements must have a legally binding status.
Mr Rasmussen rejected the suggestion that Danish ratification of the treaty
should be subjected to a time limit and said his party demanded exemption
from any participation in an EC defence policy. Ratification with a time
limit, enabling Denmark to withdraw from the treaty if developments were
regarded as incompatible with Danish interests, was one of the options
suggested in the government's white paper.
Other special arrangements which the SDP is calling for include exemption
from participation in economic and monetary union, particularly the common
currency, and union citizenship.

FT  12 OCT 92 / Fed chief refuses to rule out US rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Reserve has not ruled out further cuts in interest rates before
the US presidential election on November 3, according to Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman.
In a rare press conference, Mr Greenspan said election-year politics would
not prevent another easing of rates if this were needed on economic grounds.
'Obviously, if further actions are needed, the Fed will do so,' he said. 'If
not, not.'
Mr Greenspan said it would be 'irresponsible' for the Fed to 'abstain from
actions largely or solely because there is an election and campaign under
way'.
His remarks seemed intended to reassure financial markets, which ended last
week in an apprehensive mood after a widely expected cut in short-term rates
failed to materialise.
On Friday the Dow Jones index fell almost 40 points to close at its lowest
level this year. The yield on 30-year bonds rose above 7.5 per cent for the
first time in several weeks.
Markets had expected the Fed to act after a string of weak economic figures
 -including fresh falls in employment - seemed to indicate the fragile US
recovery was again losing momentum. On Friday markets were further unsettled
by a Financial Times report indicating the Fed probably would not cut rates
again before the election because evidence of a slowdown was, according to a
senior Fed official, 'inconclusive'.
After a weekend meeting of top US executives at Hot Springs, Virginia, Mr
Greenspan said he was concerned by the sluggish economy. 'It's clear we
still have growth but it's also clear it's not accelerating at this stage.'
However, he left his interest rate options open by referring to an
'incredible degree of uncertainty' about the economic outlook. The Fed was
watching closely to see whether consumers and businesses would spend more
freely after a lengthy period paying off debts.
Just-published minutes of an August 18 meeting of the Federal Reserve Open
Market Committee (FOMC), the top policy-making body, show that a majority of
the committee favoured giving Mr Greenspan discretion to cut short-term
rates by up to half a point. However, Mr John LeWare, a governor, and Mr
Thomas Melzer, president of the St Louis Fed, both opposed a bias towards
further easing of monetary policy.
Mr Greenspan opted for a quarter point cut to 3 per cent on September 4.
The minutes show that the Fed expected the economy to expand at a 'subdued
rate'. Minutes from last Tuesday's FOMC meeting will not be released for six
weeks.
If the Fed does opt to cut interest rates again it is likely to lower the
discount rate by half a point to 2.5 per cent. This would be accompanied by
a quarter or half point cut in the federal funds rate - the cost of
overnight money for banks.

<TEXT>
FORD is to invest FFr402m (Pounds 47.18m) in a new gearbox assembly facility
at its transmission plant at Bordeaux, France, writes Kevin Done, Motor
Industry Correspondent.
The manual transmissions will be fitted with the planned Sigma small-engine
range, in which the US car maker is investing more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds
570m). The four-cylinder, 16-valve Sigma engines will be built at Ford's
engine and car assembly plant at Valencia, Spain, and will be fitted in the
Fiesta and lower end of the Escort car ranges from 1995.
Ford said it was planning to assemble up to 650,000 of the new transmissions
a year.
The Bordeaux plant builds transaxles for the current Fiesta and Escort
ranges as well as automatic transmissions.

<TEXT>
NET profits at Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian tourism group, dropped to
BFr284m (Dollars 9.28m) in the six months to June 30 from BFr672m a year
earlier.
But before exceptional gains the company returned to the black with profits
of BFr121m, against losses of BFr227m.
The group said the travel agency and restaurant operations had turned in
particularly good results, although the mediocre economic climate continued
to hold back the hotel, railways and car-hire subsidiaries.
The company warned against reading too much into the figures because of the
seasonal nature of its business. But it said it was expecting a continued
improvement in the second half of the year.
Turnover increased to BFr45.8bn from BFr41.2bn, of which the largest part
came from the restaurant business - up to BFr15.9bn from BFr14.1bn. Travel
agency sales rose to BFr13.2bn from BFr10.1bn, while hotels generated
turnover of BFr7.17bn compared with BFr6.91bn.
Wagons-Lits is controlled by Accor, the French hotel group, which took over
the company a year ago. Minority shareholders in Wagons-Lits are still
fighting a legal battle to force Accor to increase its offer price to all
shareholders.

FT  12 OCT 92 / People: Prosser: challenge at the core of trade unionism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Margaret Prosser has been appointed national organiser of Britain's biggest
union, the TGWU. The post is the most senior to be held by a woman in that
union and involves working with the general secretary and deputy general
secretary on recruitment and organisation.
Prosser's new job means challenging the seemingly inevitable decline of
trade union membership, but her experience as the TGWU's national women's
secretary in the heartland of entrenched male attitudes should stand her in
good stead.
Prosser, now 55, won a place at a private convent but at 15 left without
qualifications to work in various offices. She had an early indication of
the potential value of women's work when she found her wages as an
accounting machine operator outstripped those of her labourer father.
Her working life was set back when in 1966 her husband Joe became paralysed.
She nursed him for eight years while caring for three children.
Enforced experience of life on the welfare system led her to activism in the
Child Poverty Action Group and from there to part-time working for an advice
centre from which she completed a postgraduate diploma course in advice and
information studies at North East London Polytechnic.
She gravitated to heading the Southwark law project, which she helped found
and in 1983 began working for the TGWU as a local official.
Colleagues say she is down-to-earth, effective and unimpressed by her own
status. She cites just one 'shouting match' in the eight years she has
worked at the TGWU's head office in London.
She is a stalwart member of the left-leaning walking group, the Red
Ramblers: 'Some call us pink, but I won't have it,' she says. She is also an
opera enthusiast, as is her taxi-driving son-in-law.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: Tradition and invention - Eating Out / Giles
MacDonogh enjoys Michel Bruneau's Norman restaurant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAEN HAS its moments, but on the whole it is not an attractive place. Like
much of Normandy, the city was heavily fought over in the weeks following
D-Day in 1944 and Allied bombing ripped out the heart of Caen.
The present centre with its uniform blocks looks rather east European, even
if it lacks the Stalinist frigidity of, say, Le Havre.
Pockets of old Caen remain, however; and it is in one of these pockets that
Normandy's best restaurant is to be found. La Bourride is owned by Michel
and Francoise Bruneau. Michel has occasionally been called the 'Paul Bocuse
of Normandy' after the chef who revived Lyonnais cooking. Normandy needs its
Bocuse: gastronomically speaking it has little of the cachet of Burgundy or
the Rhone Valley.
Most of its one star restaurants, like the Lion d'Or in Bayeux, for example,
have a jaded, dowdy air. There are no Michelin three-star restaurants: La
Bourride has two, and two is as good as you will get in Normandy.
In one of those defamatory statements which levels itself at the eating
habits of various French regions - elsewhere in Normandy there are mangeurs
de choux (cabbage-eaters) and even mangeurs de corbeaux (crow-eaters) - Caen
is written off as 'Caen-les-Tripes.' The famous bowl of tripe a la mode de
Caen cooked with carrots, cows' feet and a dash of calvados, is not on the
menu here; but that does not mean that Bruneau shuns the earthier legacy of
Norman cookery. Andouilles and andouillettes (respectively dried or fresh
tripe sausages) are also part of the culinary vocabulary of the region and
Bruneau uses andouilles either pickled in cider or as copeaux: slices
arranged round a timbale of potatoes and leeks on a cider-based beurre
blanc.
Bruneau is happy to use local ingredients whenever he can, from the newly
launched Norman foie gras to the rather better known products of local
pasture and shore-line. More exceptional perhaps, is his tolerance of cider
drinking in his restaurant.
Good Norman cider forms a pleasant half-way house between the sort of
lip-puckering brews which win prizes in the English west country and the
sugary, carbonated, semi-fermented apple-juice which passes for cider
elsewhere in Britain.
A farmhouse cider like that from Courtemanche we tasted at La Bourride can
have a touch of sweetness to it when the fermentation has not altogether
come to an end. Cider fermentation can go on for a year. A fully fermented
cider like that from Desfrieches has 'breed' but its bone-dryness might put
some English people off drinking it.
Fresh fish is naturally popular in Normandy. There are numerous preparations
in the classic cuisine which adopt the names of Norman ports such as Dieppe
or Trouville; or indeed, served with a sauce of white wine and cream and
labelled a la Normande.
Bruneau eschews the creamy, Norman style. A turbot aux cepes relied more on
the exactitude of its cooking and the full flavour of the ceps.
Elsewhere on the menu, La Bourride offers both a menu entirely composed
around scallops and another made up of three courses of lobster. Lentils and
truffles figure on both menus.
Normandy's most famous meat is the salt-meadow lamb of the Cotentin and the
Avranchin. Bruneau cooks the local lamb in a Moroccan-inspired dish with
dates and lemon. A better kept secret is Norman beef. Here the fillet is
served with a sauce made with dark rum.
The cheeseboard is a considerable test of quality in a modern restaurant
when the laws of most countries require cheeses to be kept at temperatures
which inhibit ripening. Bruneau had a beautifully ripe Camembert from Carrel
with a good cabbagey pungency and a rather milder Pont l'Eveque from
Levallier. The cheese board comes into its own from May onwards.
One of the most interesting desserts chez Bruneau (if you have any appetite
left by this stage) is the Symphonie autour d'une pomme, which we might
translate as 'symphonic variations on the theme of an apple', where all
manner of appley puddings are served up. A less lyrical apple souffle with
calvados proved a mite dry. Whether you have the symphonie or not, an array
of petits fours comes with coffee: little choux pastries, pralines, tiny
cakes etc.
La Bourride is an intelligent blend of local, Norman tradition and culinary
invention. Michel Bruneau needs just a little more brilliance in his
combination of these delicious ingredients to carry him up to the higher
reaches of the firmament.
Information: La Bourride, 15-17, rue du Vaugueux. Tel: 31. 93.50.16. Closed

FT  10 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: Relishing a right royal lifestyle - Grand
Hotel / Jill James is pampered at the Ritz in Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I IMAGINED the Duke in his later years. Sitting at the window. Quietly.
Knitting.
I sat there too, one hot afternoon in Madrid, looking out over the city's
rooftops.
It was 32`C (90`F) outside and too hot for comfort. Inside the
air-conditioned hotel suite the French carriage clock timed the silence of
the years.
Occupying the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's former suite at the Hotel Ritz,
with its splendid views over the Prado and with the Retiro park a mere
limousine's length away, I felt part of another more dignified age.
It was touching to think of the aged Duke sitting at the hotel window wiling
away the hours, perhaps trying to marshal his fading memories of England, as
the years took their toll.
Royalty has always loved the Ritz. But the days when dukes, duchesses and
counts took up lengthy residence have virtually disappeared and the
international business traveller is beginning to usurp its regal corridors.
Of course, royalty still visits 'but it's for much shorter periods now,'
concierge Luis Garcia said wistfully.
A haunt of Europe's royals since Alphonso XIII founded the hotel in 1910, it
is now favoured not so much by the captains of industry as by the supreme
commanders. The president of Sony, is a regular.
But even the most bid-weary businessmen cannot ignore the handwoven carpets,
the fresh white linen, the enormous bowl of fruit, the special chocolates
and the marble-tiled gold-tapped bathrooms that are part of its grand style.
Neither can they ignore the antique prints, the droplet chandeliers, the
beautiful flowers - the hotel has its own florist - the chairs with tassels
on the tassels.
Nevertheless, audio/visual equipment, simultaneous interpreters, bilingual
secretaries, a limousine service, mobile telephones, personal fax lines and
virtually any computer you care to name may, these days, be uppermost on the
thoughts of many who choose to stay.
'Our guests are people who travel the world the whole time and they want to
be received with respect and privacy by human beings and not by robots,'
said Mariola Calderon, the hotel's spokeswoman.
Its guests also like to eat well. And the terrace restaurant is the place to
unwind after a hard day at the screen face. It has a wonderful ambience -
you sit in a blue and green oasis in the heart of the capital.
The restaurant is still very much a place to see and be seen. Dining at the
next table when I was there last month was one of Spain's leading
politicians, Jose Bono Martinez, the president of Castilla-La Mancha.
Unfortunately, I caught the hotel between chefs, the former French chef
having left to start his own business in northern France, so it is difficult
to say what the food will be like under the new regime.
But new it will be. Alfonso Jordan, the dynamic general manager, is keen to
put more emphasis on Spanish cuisine - hence the search for a top Spanish
chef. This is as it should be. An outstanding Spanish hotel should offer
outstanding Spanish food.
I chose simply grilled hake with a tomato concasse. It was perfectly cooked
and wonderfully fresh. The city is famous for its seafood, which always
strikes me as odd given Madrid's geographical position at the heart of
Spain.
The wine list could do with a little attention - there are one or two wines
which are, perhaps, not worthy of such an hotel - and maybe the waiters who
scurry around so self-importantly could be prepared to catch your eye a
little more often. Minor quibbles perhaps, but then you are paying for
perfection. And perfection does not come cheap. Room prices start at Pta
45,000 (Pounds 254.23) for a double room and Pta 39,000 for single
occupancy.
Those who have found the money over the years have included the honeymooning
Rainiers, the Prince and Princess of Wales, diplomat Henry Kissinger, UK
premier Margaret Thatcher, actors Kirk Douglas and Warren Beatty . . . the
list goes on.
Hotel Ritz, Madrid, Plaza de la Lealtad, 5-28014 Madrid is a Forte Exclusive
Hotel of the World. Tel: 521 28 56 57. Fax: 532 87 76.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: Fine wines from the Chilean heartland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILBERT ROKVAM, Chateau Lafite's chief oenologist, casts a worried glance at
the darkening sky that promises rain. As the first heavy drops begin to
fall, Rokvam resigns himself to the fact that there will be no grape-picking
this afternoon - a minor irritant towards the close of a vintage that has
otherwise gone like clockwork.
But this is April and Rokvam is in the wine heartland of Chile, 8,000 miles
away from Bordeaux. Five years ago, a small, family-owned vineyard called
Los Vascos caught the eye of Baron Eric de Rothschild. He bought half of the
estate, joining a select group of foreign vintners who are quietly awakening
Chile's potential to produce fine wines.
Miguel Torres of Spain was the first to declare Chile a 'wine-makers'
paradise.' He owns more than 500 acres in the Central Valley. Torres was
followed by Baron Eric, California's Franciscan Vineyards, and most recently
by Bruno Prats of Chateau Cos d'Estournel with Paul Pontallier of Chateau
Margaux. A survey by the Wine Spectator found Chile to be the most popular
destination for foreign wine investors.
They are being lured by inexpensive land, the virtual absence of vine pests
and an ideal climate. The narrow Central Valley, bounded by the Andes to the
east and rolling hills by the Pacific coast, has hot, dry summers cooled by
ocean breezes at night. This, according to the experts, brings out the best
flavours in the fruit.
All that was missing was expertise and technology to modernise an industry
as old as the Spanish conquest itself. Back in the 16th century, soldiers
marching south from Peru brought grape seeds in their saddle-bags and Jesuit
missionaries planted the first vines just south of Santiago. Admiral John
Byron, the poet's grandfather, found solace in Chilean wines after being
shipwrecked off Cape Horn in 1768. 'The haciendas, or country homes, are
very pleasant, having fine olive groves and large vineyards,' he wrote.
It was around this time that the Basque forefathers of Jorge Eyzaguirre and
his wife founded their vineyard at Los Vascos. And although wine-making is
synonymous with blue-blood in Chile, Eyzaguirre says the industry was
moribund 10 years ago.
'We produced heavy, old-fashioned wines. When I started travelling abroad in
the early 1980s, I discovered that my wine was unsellable,' he recalls
without shame. His search for a white knight led him to Baron Eric. The
partnership was sealed in January 1989, but not before Rokvam had tested Los
Vascos against 167 other Chilean wines during a frantic week in Santiago.
The pace has not slackened since. A new winery was built in 60 days, in time
for the March harvest. 'I got rid of everything,' says Rokvam. 'The large
wooden vats, very quaint but useless, the old wine presses, the concrete
tanks.'
The shining steel structure that houses Los Vascos' state-of-the-art winery
and cellars may lack the romanticism attached to wine-making, but it has
alerted Chile's wine aristocracy that viticulture today has much more to do
with science than with traditions handed down through generations. They have
been quick to learn. Technological innovation and vineyard management are
now the buzz-words throughout the Central Valley.
At Los Vascos, maceration takes place in temperature-controlled stainless
steel tanks. Rokvam brought French oak barriques made at Chateau Lafite to
age the Cabernet Sauvignon.
He introduced cold fermentation for the Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. Only
the grape-harvesting is done by hand. The revolution has been so complete
that Eyzaguirre refers to his pre-89 vintages as 'Old Testament.'
Rokvam says he was at first cautious about applying the methods used at
Chateau Lafite so far away from home. After his fourth vendime at Los
Vascos, he no longer has any doubts. 'We are creating a French chateau in
Chile in the tradition of great Bordeaux wines,' he says.
The Domaines Barons de Rothschild calling card has also opened up foreign
markets. Almost the entire production from Los Vascos' 550-acre estate is
now exported to 24 countries. There are only two ways of tasting their wines
in Chile: an invitation to lunch at the Eyzaguirre's hacienda, or dinner at
Balthazar, Santiago's most exclusive restaurant.
Los Vascos is one of only four vineyards which produce 100 per cent
estate-bottled wines in Chile.
Eyzaguirre plans to keep it that way, though demand now far outstrips the
150,000 cases he can supply each year. He is expanding his vineyard, but, he
reflects, even the race to produce world-class wines requires patience.
Los Vascos wines are available from Fortnum &amp; Mason and branches of Bottoms
Up.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Carried along by a delightful Dream - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN GOOD Shakespeare, the end of the play is the end of expectation. From the
opening line, A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield,
carries an excitement through to a perfect close. The Crucible Company has
fashioned a simple, delightful production of Shakespeare's most fantastical
play, apt preparation for Peter Pan in December, and a fine 21st birthday
present for the Crucible.
The production gives Shakespeare played straight, without connivance or
distortion. The cumulative effects emerge subtly. The action accrues the
energies released at the end, when the actors appear in civvies, dissolving
the theatrical illusion even while inviting the audience, in song, to 'bless
this place.'
The design (by Kendra Ullyart) suits the Crucible's deep three-sided
auditorium: an undulating green fronts a classical facade which gives way to
a riot of orchids and water lilies beneath an arching bridge, just like
Monet's garden at Giverny. The lighting (Geoff Mersereau) at first looked
unimaginative, but the forest scenes reveal a green foreground a violet
middle-distance and a turquoise backdrop.
The acting follows the fine leads of Michael Mueller (Theseus-Oberon) and
Alex Kingston (Hippolyta-Titania), the one all chintz and the other all
Romany. Both handle the verse with intelligence and tact, implying a stormy,
sexy union - 'Ill-met by moonlight, proud Titania' - without obviousness or
grossness. Mueller has a working rapport with Clive Kneller's Puck, a
ragged-trousered philanthropist who bestows his gifts on the wrong
Athenians.
In the wood, Titania's fairies are erotic creatures, stalking with naked
foot, like women in Thomas Wyatt's verse. They make Bottom's stay there
believable. The wood's other inmates, the 'rude mechanicals' present
themselves without the usual farce and buffoonery. They elicit the laughter
of goodwill rather than the laugh of condescension.
Anthony Brown as Bottom finds a gentle amplitude in the Part, all quietness,
as if he had listened to Hamlet's advice to the players. He times the lines
superbly.
Michael Rudman's direction keeps the lightly-cut text humming along. The
plot emerges so clearly that new details strike the sense. How about that
mysterious woman who never appears? Two of the lovers from Athens are
heading for her house when they get lost in the wood. She is Lysander's
widow aunt. Lysander should have called ahead, she'd have enjoyed being part
of it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Crucible Theatre, Sheffield (0742 - 769922)
until 24 October

FT  10 OCT 92 / Fashion: One small voice is heard in the land of the giants
 -Why London is such a worthwhile launchpad for talented young designers to
show their potential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWICE A year, between the ready-to-wear giants of Milan and Paris, the
London designer shows flare briefly over a weekend, invariably amid trade
and media soul-searching as to whether they are necessary and viable.
The British Fashion Council says the clothing industry is healthy, worth
Pounds 6 1/2 bn, including Pounds 2bn in exports, an increase of 8 per cent
this year. The industry employs 180,000 even in this deep recession. So why
the designer worries?
The problem is that 'clothing', rather than 'fashion', sums up most of the
British industry. John Wilson of the BFC estimates that the high-profile
designers revealing their wares for next spring this weekend account for
only about 2 per cent of the total and that any of them turning over more
than Pounds 1m per year are doing well. Yet, ever since the Swinging Sixties
put London creativity on the map, they have exerted an influence out of all
proportion to the size of their businesses.
Britain's talented and underfunded designers must try to attract as many
international buyers and press as the vast, industry-backed circuses of
Milan and Paris. They export nearly 70 per cent of their production, against
26 per for the rest of the industry. British designers who take their shows
to the other capitals in an attempt to tackle the wider market are reviled
as unpatriotic. This year the annual British Designer Awards has become
embroiled in controversy over what is 'British'. Some designers have
declined nominations because they disagree with the entry criteria.
This dispute risks making the one British fashion event of the year that
gets serious national TV coverage look ridiculous. It also risks the
accusation that British fashion is about nothing but squabbling in a very
small arena.
But all is far from gloomy. The London Designer Show is the most attractive,
best-organised exhibition and catwalk venue in Europe and, by clever
juggling of sponsorship, the organisers are able to keep prices at a level
to which designers without vast backing can at least aspire. Those who
choose to show elsewhere in London still attract buyers, either because,
like Jean Muir, they have shown in the same place for years and their
customers know where to find them, or because they are young, new and
impecunious in which case the buyers will come lest they miss a new talent.
The buyers' eye for creativity may be even more important this year - so far
the international response looks more promising than for some time and the
devalued pound must help.
Annette Worsley-Taylor, show organiser, says: 'Now the longer skirt is
well-established there is a feeling that fashion needs something else new
and exciting. The buyers' hunch is that London may possibly offer it.
Designers here aren't into big, glitzy, supermodel-packed shows but buyers
have had enough of those and there is now a recognition that British fashion
is not just tweed and knitwear on the one hand and wacky street fashion on
the other. We are increasingly known for well-designed yet interesting,
beautifully-cut clothes.'
Worsley-Taylor insists that government and industry support for
designer-fashion exports is essential if British designers want to move into
the European market. Yet this is where the quandaries start. Once backing,
sometimes from international companies, is provided, there is a tendency for
designers to show abroad, especially if that is where their collections are
made.
As John Richmond, who shows spectacularly in London and is for the first
time a nominee for Designer of the Year, says: 'In the end you have to go to
the centre, and that is Paris. I am looking for agents to sell my diffusion
range in Europe in a year's time. If that works out and we expand as a
result then we will probably move the show.'
But those moving on from London clear the stage for newcomers. This season
several excellent designers, such as Jasper Conran and Ally Capellino, who
have not been able to afford a show for some years, have corporate help -
from Marchpole, part of the French Biedermann group, and Coats Viyella
respectively - which will give them the well-deserved exposure that a
catwalk show brings.
Industrial support for European designers helps explain Continental
fashion's gloss and efficiency. Finally the same kind of links are happening
in the UK, though they will work only if they are light-handed enough to
allow the designers full creative play.
Meanwhile, young and as yet unsponsored talents arise and London is a
comparatively inexpensive launch-pad. John Richmond has been pushing for
years to make London an international showcase for young designers. 'We
haven't the resources to be the same as Paris or Milan', he says, 'so we
need to establish ourselves as something different. As we are known for
creativity we should move in that direction.'
As a huge fashion-selling powerhouse Britain may always be outgunned by
France, Italy and Germany. But as a breeding ground for innovative designers
Britain seem to have arrived.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The quest for sales in arid
ground - A man who makes light-weight drills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY people have bright ideas for equipment suited to the Third World. Peter
Ball of Eureka is one of the few to turn them into a viable business.
Ball went to Cambodia this summer to test a light, easy-to- use drilling rig
he has designed for Oxfam. He is shortly returning there for the Irish
agency CONCERN which has ordered one of his larger, standard models. He also
has an inquiry for Somalia.
Roger Newton of Oxfam says that the Ball drill with its deep reach has been
very successful in enabling Oxfam's Cambodia team to tap vital water.
Ball has been involved in drilling since 1972 when, after an engineering
apprenticeship, he went to Ethiopia with a team from Tear Fund. The drill
bit got stuck in soft ground down the first hole; but, in the harder rock of
Tigray, they provided water for about 25 villages.
In the early 1980s he won for his then employers, Hydreq, a Littlehampton
drill-manufacturer, a contract for water for 44 villages in Nigeria's Kano
state. A British engineer was planning a long-term water supplies. But the
project also took a long time, requiring three years for the contract
negotiations. Ball believed he could speed things up if he could get
appropriate equipment into African hands.
He left Hydreq and spent six months designing his own rig. The result is a
drill, the standard model of which, with associated equipment, costs Pounds
18,000, half the price of conventional gear.
But the big saving, he says, is in management time, operator-training and
workshop back-up. A crew can go off into the bush with a Eureka rig on a
trailer towed by a Land Rover.
The rig is mechanical, not hydraulic, which makes it easier for operators
inexperienced in handling equipment. A Honda engine rotates the drill: the
operators apply the downward force. It can be used in both hard and soft
rock. It has a mud tank in which rubbish from the hole settles out of the
drilling fluid, allowing this to be reused.
Normally engineers use a mud pit but Peter Ball had noticed that Nigerian
drillers found it hard to get these pits the right size.
With a recommendation from Robin Temple-Hazell, a Bath hydrologist who has
spent a lifetime prospecting for water in Nigeria, he got an order for his
first rig from a World Bank-funded agricultural project in Bauchi state. The
Nigerians wanted to see a videotape of the rig before they would pay the air
freight. But it worked well, and Ball has sold over 30, built for him by CSA
Engineering of Capel, near Dorking.
Eureka turned over Pounds 175,000 in the last year, yielding a small profit
of Pounds 5,000 for reinvestment and providing Ball and his wife  - who
looks after the books - with enough to live on. They finance the business
with an overdraft secured on their home.
The bulk of Ball's rigs are used to provide water for irrigation. He is sad
that only four are working on village water supplies and that he has made no
sales outside Nigeria and Cambodia. Consultants are conservative. Tenderers
often want two competitive quotes; and Eureka does not have a direct
competitor. You have to wait for chances, and hang in, he says.
Village water contracts commonly go to outside contractors. Ball argues
that, since one bore hole with hand pump can supply only 120 people,
villages need a local rig to keep on drilling after the contractor has gone.
Interesting aid agencies in his rigs proved difficult until Oxfam approached
him. It had found a light rig (designed by an East European) more adaptable
and less expensive in Cambodia than a conventional rig mounted on a lorry.
Ball's Eureka can drill an eight-inch hole to a depth of 60 metres. Oxfam
asked him to design a lighter six-inch, 30-metre version.
The new rig has in fact drilled to 45 metres in Cambodia and is adaptable to
different types of rock and ground and to different tasks. One of Oxfam's
aims is to use it to find sites for dug wells, which can supply more
villagers than a hand pump.
Dry British summers brought Ball inquiries about bore holes for garden
watering. These gave him a chance to use the Eureka rig in Britain and
brought so many orders that he teamed up with another drilling firm. About a
third of the holes they bored are for gardens, a third for golf courses and
a third for farms. They drilled a 12-inch hole to water the greenhouses at
Ford Open Prison. But 1992's wet summer dried up orders, and Ball's focus is
again overseas.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hospital Corporation Pounds 2.1m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOSPITAL Corporation International Group, which was created in January when
HCI of the US reversed into Bioplan Holdings, the UK healthcare group,
incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.1m in the six months to June 30.
In the nine months to December 31 losses totalled Pounds 21.4m, after
exceptional charges of Pounds 16.8m - a result of the new management's
adoption of a more conservative approach to Bioplan's accounting policies.
In the period under review turnover was Pounds 13.3m and operating profits
for continuing businesses Pounds 327,000.
However, there were exceptional costs of Pounds 641,000 relating to losses
from the West Peaks hospital in Macclesfield, now sold for Pounds 2.4m to
the National Health Service, and interest charges of Pounds 1.78m.
Mr James Mills-Webb, finance director and chief executive of the UK
operations, said that borrowings - below Pounds 17m, with Pounds 5m of lease
obligations - were about the same as the end-December figure.
In the half year to September 30 1991 - not comparable, said Mr Mills-Webb,
because the figures, albeit restated, were only for Bioplan's UK operations
 -turnover was Pounds 7.49m, operating losses were Pounds 5.85m after
exceptional costs of Pounds 4.61m, and pre-tax losses were Pounds 6.14m.
The company currently has nine hospitals in the UK, one in Panama and one
American Medical Centre in Moscow, with AMCs in Beijing and St Petersburg
opening by the year-end.
Mr Mills-Webb said that occupancy levels in the UK stood at 45-50 per cent,
but that it was not like the hotel business; the number of patients treated
was what made profits.
Some 75 per cent of the company's assets and Pounds 9m of its Pounds 13.3m
turnover was in the UK, he said.
Losses per share emerged at 2.63p (16.7p) and again there is no dividend.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: LTU confirms talks with Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LTU, the German travel group, confirmed that it had talks with Owners
Abroad, the UK's second largest tour operator, but said it had spoken to
other companies as well.
The statement by LTU follows days of speculation that a bid for Owners
Abroad was imminent. Earlier this week, Owners Abroad said it received a
tentative approach from a potential purchaser but that no bid had been made.
The approach is thought to have been made by Airtours, the third largest UK
operator.
LTU said yesterday: 'We're just checking out the European market. If you're
thinking about 1993, you have to talk to companies all over the place. We've
spoken to Owners Abroad as we've spoken to many, many companies-and not only
in England.'
Asked whether LTU might offer its services as a white knight if Airtours was
to bid for Owners Abroad, the German company said: 'We don't think there's
anything to that.'
Owners Abroad refused to comment on its attitude to a possible bid from LTU.
Its shares closed up 3 1/2 p at 73p.
LTU bought Thomas Cook, the travel agency, earlier this year. A move to buy
a full or partial stake in a tour operator would be consistent with the
current consolidation taking place in the travel market.
Airtours last month purchased the Pickfords Travel agency chain from NFC,
the transport group, for Pounds 16m. Mr David Crossland, chairman of
Airtours, said owning a travel agency chain would improve sales of the tour
operator's holidays.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Savimbi may drop threats of war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES were rising last night that Angola's mercurial rebel leader, Mr Jonas
Savimbi, would back away from threats of resuming guerrilla war and agree to
take part in a government of national unity following the country's first
free elections.
US assistant secretary of state Herman Cohen said Mr Savimbi was likely to
emerge from isolation in his southern stronghold of Huambo to come to Luanda
to accept President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' invitation of talks on a
government of reconciliation.
'We feel that there is still time and still grounds for optimism,' said Mr
Cohen.
Earlier, Miss Margaret Anstee, the United Nations special envoy, visited Mr
Savimbi, in the first meeting he has had with an international observer
since last week's elections put President Dos Santos and his MPLA government
well in the lead.
Unita has alleged electoral fraud and threatened to return to guerrilla war.
Miss Anstee said last night Mr Savimbi had said he would accept the poll
result if an investigation demanded by Unita proved there had been no fraud.
The critical question is whether Mr Savimbi is trying to exploit the fears
of a return to civil war to force concessions from the government on a
post-electoral set-up or whether he is unable to compromise and determined
to go back to war.
'The problem is that none of us knows what Savimbi's bottom line is,' said a
western diplomat.
'After all these years of external support he remains an enigma and nobody,
not even Washington and Pretoria, has any leverage on him.'
In the past week, Mr Savimbi has challenged the election results, withdrawn
his generals from the newly unified army and retreated from Luanda to Huambo
 -the politically symbolic southern city from which he launched his
guerrilla struggle in 1975.
If Mr Savimbi is merely playing a dangerous game of high-stakes
brinkmanship, as seems more likely, it remains unclear what concessions he
will accept. Given that he won 40 per cent of the national vote, observers
say neither party can rule alone.
Possible compromises, dubbed by a Portuguese minister as 'disappointment
management', are being considered in Luanda, including a second round of
presidential elections, a genuine power-sharing arrangement at national and
provincial levels and the idea of a joint administration.
A second round looks most likely to keep Mr Savimbi in the peace process but
it is doubtful if he would win.
However, nobody knows whether Mr Savimbi, after 30 years of bush warfare and
internal propaganda, is psychologically able to accept anything less than
the presidency.
The second problem is convincing the government, and particularly the MPLA
hardliners, to bend over backwards to make concessions after a democratic
victory.
Western observers say hopes for preventing a return to civil war rest on the
fact that in the post-cold war era and after free elections Mr Savimbi can
no longer expect the military and diplomatic support he received from
Washington and Pretoria between 1975 and 1991.
Referring to the possibility of renewed warfare, Mr Cohen said Unita knew
'this is an impossible procedure. There will be absolutely no support in the
international community or internally for such an operation.'

The latest figure compares with an SDR25.4m profit in the comparable 1991

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS between Iraq and the US escalated yesterday when Baghdad seized an
American munitions expert inside the Kuwait border, and asked a crucial
weapons team to delay inspections until after the US presidential elections
in November, Reuter reports from Washington.
State Department spokesman Mr Richard Boucher said the US was working
through diplomatic channels to secure the release of a US citizen named as
Mr Chad Hall.
At the United Nations, Mr Nizar Hamdoun, Iraq's UN ambassador, said he hoped
'things could be resolved through diplomatic means rather than to get into
any situation whereby a crisis may emerge.' Mr Hall 'was safe and in good
health', said the Iraqi ambassador.
A spokesman for Environmental Health Research and Testing, a Kentucky
company clearing away ammunition and explosives left in Kuwait from the
Iraqi occupation, said Mr Hall had been working in the area since March.
The spokesman said Mr Hall was 'well inside' the demilitarised zone, 'more
than one kilometre. . . when he was approached by two men who identified
themselves as Iraqis'. He said Mr Hall and two Pakistani employees of the
company were only 100 metres from a UN observation post inside Kuwait, but
the Iraqis, who were armed, threatened Mr Hall, and 'forced him to go the
other side' of the border.
Meanwhile, Iraq asked a crucial weapons team to delay inspections until
after the US elections. UN spokesman Mr Francois Giuliani said the unusually
large weapons inspection team of 50-60 people would go ahead anyway on
October 17. It is composed of experts on ballistic missiles and chemical and
biological weapons.
Reuter adds:The US, under pressure to clear up its debts to the UN,
yesterday paid Dollars 225.8m of its share of the UN's 1992 budget, but
still owes more than Dollars 300m in various costs. The US State Department
said the payment brought to Dollars 780.3m the total amount paid to the UN
this year.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Danes outline looser ties with EC to help ratify Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK drew a cautious response from Brussels yesterday when it proposed a
series of options for loosening its links with the European Community.
Senior EC officials stressed that the long-awaited Danish white paper was
just a first step in a lengthy process of negotiation between Denmark and
her 11 partners on how to secure Danish ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
Denmark put forward the proposals in an attempt to find a workable framework
for its future relationship with the EC. These links have been put in
jeopardy by Denmark's rejection of the treaty in its June referendum.
One of the eight white paper options likely to be studied with particular
attention is a proposal under which Denmark could ratify the Maastricht
treaty, subject to a time limit. It could then withdraw if the Community
develops in ways which are not compatible with Danish interests.
Another option in the paper proposes introducing additional clauses to the
treaty. These would affect all 12 member-states. The paper also proposes
giving Denmark a special status in the Community.
The EC's fundamental problem is that the treaty cannot come into force until
it has been ratified by all 12 member-states.
For the moment, there is a consensus among Denmark's partners that there can
be no renegotiation of the treaty. Diplomats and legal experts in European
capitals are urgently examining wording which could accommodate the Danes
without amounting to an amendment of Maastricht, which would require
re-ratification.
One potential solution being studied in Brussels is to produce a declaration
of 'common ground' on the need for subsidiarity - decision-making at the
lowest appropriate level - signed by the 11 members and Denmark.
A political declaration covering other specific Danish requests could be
produced in a form short of a protocol. This would not require
re-ratification of the treaty but would draw on specific EC laws and would
offer reassurance to Danes on issues of concern - citizenship, defence and
the environment.
Danish officials say the white paper represents the starting point for
negotiations between prime minister Poul Schluter's minority government and
other parties in the Folketing (parliament). The Danish foreign ministry
describes it as 'an analytical tool for the politicians'.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, said he hoped a Danish paper
with more concrete proposals would be ready in November. This could allow a
framework agreement to be reached with other EC governments at the Edinburgh
summit in December.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Kissing in the European style: John Major gave Lady Thatcher
a peck on the cheek. Is this acceptable?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most telling political image of the Tories' week in Brighton was that of
John Major kissing Lady Thatcher up on the platform, in full view of both
delegates and - more important - television cameras. One has seen less
sincere and much more repulsive political kisses - a slobbery embrace
between Mikhail Gorbachev and Erich Honecker stands out particularly in my
memory.
Major's body language below the mouth was most revealing. While kissing his
predecessor he simultaneously grabbed both her wrists with his hands. Only
when the lady was thus rendered helpless did the Prime Minister lean forward
close enough to kiss.
Lady Thatcher gazed fixedly over Mr Major's left shoulder. What else could
she do?
Yet while the embrace had a certain political resonance, no one so far as I
am aware, has questioned its propriety.
The social kissing of men and women in public is a very recent development,
except for those who move in bohemian and arty circles. It is thought to
have been introduced into respectability by the Princess of Wales at around
the time of her marriage. The Princess is a wonderfully touchy feely sort of
person, and finds such a gesture wholly natural.
But almost all Englishmen, and most Englishwomen lack the Princess of
Wales's innate warmth and physicality: they have adopted her practice, but
clearly feel very awkward doing it.
There are a number of difficulties. Who makes the first lunge? Is it to be a
single kiss (Mwa]) or a Continental double (Mwa] Mwa])?
There is a fundamental problem in the whole endeavour: the shape of the
human face. This decrees that it is almost impossible to kiss someone on the
cheek at the same time as he or she is kissing you on the cheek.
For the benefit of readers I consulted The Spectator's etiquette agony aunt,
Mary Killen. She says: 'The double kiss has been discredited in polite
circles following its adoption by Cilla Black on her Television show Blind
Date. However, if you must persist the rule is for the kisser to place the
lips on the left cheek of the kissee, and then wait to receive a symmetrical
response.'
What is still not acceptable, in public at least, is the social kissing of
men with men. To make such a gesture would be to invite instant rumours that
one is homosexual.
Recently we went on holiday to Italy. I found that men whom I scarcely knew
would kiss me goodbye. At first I reeled backwards, but then my wife
explained to me that these friends of hers were not fruits but were
perfectly ordinary Italian men expressing affection in a manly way. By the
end of the holiday I had become quite used to the idea and was kissing along
with the best of them.
In a way the Italians are more logical than we are - and not just the
Italians; the Russians, pace Mikhail Gorbachev, are mighty man to man
kissers. If one kisses a woman socially it indicates no more than affection.
It is not in any way a lustful embrace. So why should not the same be
acceptable between men?
The problem at the moment is that we have only the handshake. That is fine
when one first meets someone, or at the start of a game of competitive
chess, such as that now going on between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky.
But I do find it slightly ridiculous that the handshake remains almost the
only acceptable public greeting between men friends who have developed a
warm relationship over many years.
The Americans, I know, have developed alternatives: the playful punch on the
shoulder, or even the hug, but neither of these are particularly elegant or
aesthetic.
So I proposed to Mary Killen that official endorsement be given to social
kissing between males. It didn't take, I'm afraid.
'No] We really must call a stop to this promiscuous cheek bashing. It's
already causing too much confusion and embarrassment. Nobody feels
comfortable doing it. I do hope you are not going to attempt to introduce
this foreign thing of male kissing into Britain.'
'No, Mary,' I said, lamely. 'You're the expert.'
But I couldn't help recalling what one of the Italians said to me, when I
commented that in England the practise of male kissing was thought to be a
sign of dangerous effeminacy.
'The reason why Englishmen don't like kissing each other' he said 'is that
so many of you really are homosexual. You are afraid you might get carried
away.'
No danger of that, at least between John Major and Lady Thatcher.

<TEXT>
Ross Perot rang me yesterday. I wish he would leave me alone, for the pesky
little Texan is becoming extremely nuisanceful. He regards me as the London
member of the Committee to Elect Ross Perot, though I have told him to
include me out. The only good that came of yesterday's conversation was that
I was able to tell Perot the name of the winner of Hawks &amp; Handsaws' Little
Rays of Light Across the Planet's Doomed and Pitted Surface competition.
'How you doing, boy?' demanded Perot grumpily when Miss Lee, my assistant,
put him through. 'Still keeping your hair short and shaving twice a day? I
hope you're not playing roulette, boy, or consorting with married females.
They can cast a boy down utterly, boy - just snap him in half like a twig.'
'No, Mr Perot,' I said wearily.
I was put on the Committee to Elect Ross Perot last June, after meeting
Perot in a restaurant in Vail where I was eating my dinner, probably elk
though it could have been buck deer. For some reason, Perot had the notion
that I was an expert on techno-politics - electronic voting, that sort of
thing - and that I was the type of can-do boy with whom he could do
business.
'I want you to help me, boy,' said Perot yesterday. 'Ever since I let my
millions of supporters browbeat me into re-entering the race for president,
jumped-up media folk with no more wits than a coyote in a barrel have been
saying I don't have a foreign policy, so I'm coming to London to rustle one
up. Just a few days, boy. Here's what you do. Book me a hotel. If you have
to, buy one. Get me some theatre tickets - Andrew Boyd Webster. And line up
some people, strictly top brass - the prime minister and his side-kick for
finance. What are their names, boy?'
'Laurel and Hardy,' I said. 'But nobody will see you. They've all
disappeared, skiddooed off to Pluto. Britain's economic policy went up in
smoke three weeks ago, along with every other policy, so we're the laughing
stock of Europe. We've been beastly to the Germans. Everybody hates us. The
reason Laurel and Hardy have skiddooed off to Pluto is that they genuinely
and sincerely don't know whether interest rates should go down or go up. Can
you imagine that, Mr Perot?' 'What about the foreign minister?'
'Pluto, Mr Perot.'
'Commerce?'
'Pluto.'
'Transportation?'
'Pluto.'
'How's about Queen Liz?'
'Skiddooed - ages ago. Let's face it, Mr Perot, there's nobody here but us
chickens.'
'Nobody?'
'Well, the lumpen intelligentsia is still thick on the ground. I could get
you Michael Ignatieff or Jeremy Paxman, Mr Perot. No prob whatsoever.'
'Can't you suggest anything? I had high hopes of you, boy.'
I said: 'What you need, Mr Perot, is a big idea, something to put the fun
back into American politics. Here's one for free. Recently, Hawks and
Handsaws staged a competition in which readers were invited to suggest ideas
for brightening our lives. I called these ideas LRLAPDPS's: Little Rays of
Light Across the Planet's Doomed and Pitted Surface.
'The winner - you are the first person to hear this, Mr Perot - is E V
Bernard of the Isle of Man, who suggests an MCFMP: Musical Chairs For
Members of Parliament campaign. He wants musical chairs three times a day,
each game eliminating an MP until there are only 250 left.
'He predicts various beneficial effects: '1) The remaining members will be
fit, alert and quick-thinking, a marked improvement on current standards; 2)
It should be possible to find useful and productive employment for all
attendees, rather than having some 300 or 400 unoccupied mischief-makers
wandering about the place as happens now; 3) The reduction in numbers would
enable present salaries to be doubled without cost to the taxpayer, thus
encouraging a better class of applicant in future'.
'Wouldn't that be fun, Mr Perot?'
'You're addled, boy,' snapped the smallest man in Texas. 'Your brain's been
drained. Roulette and married females have ruinated you, boy. You're
practically a communist. I'm firing y'all this minute]'
Runners-up in the Little Rays of Light competition were Ian and Wendy
Campbell of Edinburgh. FT prizes will be sent to all three quite shortly.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Private View: Bringing the cosmos down to earth -
Cosmologist John Barrow discusses life, the universe and the possible
existence of a Theory of Everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN THE Secret of the Universe be written on the front of a T-shirt?
Religious belief is in secular decline in the West, its explanations
seemingly exhausted. Now science, having murdered Faith, is accused of
failing us in its turn. The bookshops are bursting with competing answers:
on one rack religion, psychology and philosophy; on another astrology,
mythology and the occult; on a third, particle physics, the human gene,
consciousness, the universe, Everything. We are still desperately looking
for that whatever-it-is.
One of the best guides to the cosmic tour is John Barrow, author of the
T-shirt question. He is a 39-year-old cosmologist, professor of astronomy at
the University of Sussex, who studies the birth of the universe and the
formation of the galaxies. His popular books revolve around questions of the
ultimate. Is there a Theory of Everything, a TOE? Or is the grand unified
theory, so spectacularly marketed by Stephen Hawking, just wishful thinking?
Barrow may not have spectacular answers and his gifts as a scientist I
cannot judge. But as a populariser he is uncommonly successful: eclectic,
fluent, graphic and clear. His latest contribution, Pi in the Sky, discusses
whether mathematics (the form in which the TOE would be revealed) is in some
sense real, or whether it is just an uncannily successful device for
explaining the world to ourselves. The journey is as interesting as the
destination, as Barrow explains why words for 'one' and 'two' so often have
different roots from words for 'first' and 'second', or why ancient
shepherds could not count sheep.
Why should Barrow bother to tell us all this?
'It isn't to spread my name,' he said. 'It's important to get scientific
ideas across. I felt other people wouldn't write the books I wanted to read
 -so I had to write them myself.'
Scientists, he added, were writing their own popularisations these days to
explain their ideas to each other as much as to the public. 'So the public
are participating in a live dialogue, not just being sold a story.'
Is it also because science has become too difficult for non-scientists to
explain?
'In the UK popularisation has meant producing little pictures of what things
are like - for instance, how quarks are confined in nuclei like balls in a
rubber bag. It has come to mean producing analogies. At the turn of the
century continentals such as Poincare criticised us for that. But if you
look at what real scientists are doing you have to say that what they are
producing is analogies - if rather more complex, abstract and high-powered.
You might see mathematics as an analogy - or you might regard it as the real
thing.'
Is physics at a watershed? Is that why there is this desire to produce
ordinary-language explanations?
'For some reason there is enormous public interest. It is almost like a
substitute religion. The traditional view is that people like to have some
transcendent reality, just like they have to have a sense of community in
society. Perhaps this hankering after ideas of ultimate truth fits into that
category.
'But it can't be the whole story because people with conventional beliefs
are interested in these developments in science. One blatantly chauvinistic
attitude would be to say these things just are more interesting than
anything else on offer.'
Barrow is persuasive on a platform but in private is cautious, even
monotonous. He is agile physically as he is mentally; he was an 800 metres
runner, a former junior national indoor champion who once beat Steve Ovett.
It was through athletics that he acquired his unusual fluency and wide
knowledge. His seven A levels included classical Greek, religious studies
and English, which he read for at home with his philosophy-trained running
coach, John Turp, in exchange for instructing Turp in maths and physics.
'So I got used at a very early age to explaining things orally and learning
things by explaining them.'
There was no science in the family: his father worked for a subsidiary of
Joe Lyons, the catering chain.
Why did he choose cosmology?
'I can remember from the age of 16 or so wanting to do astrophysics. I was
not one of these people who wanted to look through telescopes. What
interested me was this issue of mathematics. I remember asking at school:
Why is that when we heat this thing up it does what the maths says it will
do? How does it know? The prospect of being able to understand a star
millions of light years away just by using simple laws of heat and gravity
all seemed very neat.'
When I asked him about those who accuse science of barren ambition, he
replied that specialisation was inevitable: western science had been so
fertile precisely because a monotheistic religion had prompted the search
for natural laws handed down by a divine lawgiver. Oriental science had been
retarded by the application of etiquette and harmony to nature.
Like Stephen Hawking before him, Barrow was summoned to Rome to debate
cosmology with Vatican theologians. God and science are not in opposition,
he said. 'You can think of God as a mathematician or computer programmer, if
you like, as lighting the blue touchpaper and retiring. Theologians prefer
to think of God as sustaining the world from moment to moment.'
It was biologists, not cosmologists, who were most hostile to religion
because of the Darwinians' struggle against the church in the last century.
'Cosmologists, I think, appreciate the uncertainty of their subject. They
are less confident and strident than biologists, with good reason. They have
less data. If you look at their personal views, you will find many more
cosmologists with strong religious beliefs than you would ever find
biologists.'
Are you interested in revealed religion?
'In my Theories of Everything I made the connection with mythological
accounts of the world. These in a sense were the first theories of
everything. They tried to include everything, leave nothing unknown or
inexplicable because it was too frightening. They made huge tapestries into
which to interweave more and more facts.'
Do you believe in resurrection and redemption?
Barrow was evasive. 'There may be a religious perspective that you won't
find in a test tube or in an equation: I'm a strong believer that there are
complementary ways of looking at the world.
'The scientific approach is different. Take a neon sign, for example. You
could explain it in terms of quantum electronics with 100 per cent
completeness but you wouldn't want to write down what the sign was actually
saying as part of that description. To say that the sign said 'Coca Cola'
wouldn't be part of the scientific account.'
I asked him to define the limits of science. Are you running out of
analogies? Is the world untranslateable now in a way that the Newtonian
world of billiard balls was not?
Barrow came back to his conundrum about the reality of mathematics. 'Is the
world really mathematical or is maths just a way of describing the world?
This is the crux of the question.
'Take a computer programme that simulates how galaxies form: load it up with
laws of gravity, run it to simulate billions of years, watch the clusters
occur. Continuing into the far future you would see stars and planets form;
you might see living beings evolve in the computer program which could
transmit messages to each other. Practically speaking, they would be
conscious but they would have no material existence. What are they? They
exist in the programming, in the mathematics. A Platonist would say they
exist in every possible sense of the word.
'There is this extraordinary power of mathematics. It doesn't almost work,
it works precisely and wonderfully and it works best in those areas such as
elementary particle physics that are farthest removed from our everyday
experience. So to say we just developed this capacity sounds wrong. Where
there is no evolutionary advantage, maths works most persuasively.'
Do cosmologists feel they are reaching the limits of what they can assert
and convey?
'They certainly might be reaching the end of the observational and
experimental road. There are two big constraints here. The first is: suppose
a Theory of Everything exists in some form, why should we be able to
understand and unravel it, living in 1992 on a planet in the suburbs of the
Milky Way? It's an extraordinary anti-Copernican presumption that we should
be clever enough to understand this after just a few hundred years of
thinking about it.
'The other telling point is that what we can know is conditioned by the
evolutionary process, by the necessities of surviving in our environment. As
far as we can judge there is no reason why understanding a Theory of
Everything is necessary for our survival.'
Does it matter if there is a TOE or not? Are you able to say if there is
one?
'I'm obviously not in a position to say, but I can speculate. If you look at
what scientists do there is almost a presumption that there is. It's grown
out of the idea that there is a single lawgiver and a set of laws. What's
the alternative, a series of cosmic Berlin walls?'
Would the TOE be boring?
'Well, it could turn out to be a necessary truth. There could be one and
only one possible mathematical theory in which every piece of the jigsaw
puzzle will fit. That's what people hope. The alternative, which to me seems
more likely, is that the theory would allow many different types of
universe, of which ours is one example. Just as the laws of nature allow
many outcomes in which the symmetries of the laws are broken and disguised,
the universe itself may be one of these disguised outcomes.'
Would it be a testable, useful theory.?
'It might be. But suppose there was a theory and we could find it by some
flash of insight, why should we be able to test it or check it? This is a
much more significant point. The problem is that theory races way ahead of
experiment. We don't have the financial means, the practical means, to test
theories about the beginning of the universe. Why should the universe be so
constructed that we should be able to test these theories?' So we could end
up with several consistent theories and no way of distinguishing which was
the right one?
'That's right.'
In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Douglas Adams makes the computer,
Deep Thought, cough up the answer to the riddle of the universe. It is 42.
Deep Thought cannot, of course, supply the question. So, the day we learn
there really is a TOE, I doubt I shall feel too excited. I shall wait for
John Barrow's book.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Clinging to the wreckage - Bernard Kops is a survivor
 -and a busy one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL ARDITTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The East End in the 1930s may have been poor in most respects, but it was
rich in incipient playwrights. The young Harold Pinter, Arnold Wesker and
Bernard Kops were all growing up in neighbouring streets. Today Pinter has
retreated into near silence and Wesker is disgracefully neglected, but Kops
is busier than ever, with a radio serial, Soho Nights, in pre-production and
two new plays recently opened on the London stage.
Kops is very much the junior member of the triumvirate: the Spender to
Pinter's Auden and Wesker's Isherwood. His experiments in various media  -
since 1955 he has published nine novels, six books of poetry and an
autobiography as well as having 32 plays produced on radio and television
and 15 on the stage - have left him undervalued by a critical establishment
that regards versatility as the province of the Jack of all trades.
He is now, however, reaping the benefit. 'Early on, I suffered because I
didn't join a group; I was never an 'ism' or an 'ist'. But if you come in on
a bandwagon, you go out on one; people who surround you and kiss your toes
go away and find other toes to kiss. I had a letter from Wesker only this
morning. He wrote that: 'it's great you're doing so well; I sadly am not.
And the reason for that is there's no one to foreclose on me.' '
He offers an explanation for their conjunction of talents: 'Jewish families
all had the gift of the gab. Look at market stalls and the way they use
language, with everyone talking the whole time. We were a bit like the brat
pack of Jewish painters: Domberg, Rosenberg and Certler, who sat in the Cafe
Royal full of chutzpah, refusing to accept their position in life. There was
an anarchistic element in our background and a tremendous desire to escape
from desperate circumstances.'
There was also a teacher in the background, the legendary Marianne Watson,
who ran evening classes at Toynbee Hall - 'I think Harold and Arnold also
went' - and introduced him to a dramatic tradition quite unknown in his
impoverished immigrant home. 'The only cultural connection was a Dutch band,
Joe Kops and the Hot Shots.' As soon as he could, he escaped his family 'to
find my identity', but he has since returned to it constantly in his novels
and plays.
His escape route was the streets of Soho: 'a world of immorality,
prostitution, mad, passionate love and everything that was opposed to family
life'. But the release proved too radical: 'I had an incredible breakdown
and spent a year in hospital.' Soon afterwards he married and fathered four
children. It's tempting to see his subsequent development as an attempt to
marry the two extremes of his nature: the rootless, Bohemian, Soho side and
the family man.
In conversation, he constantly acknowledges his debt to Erica, who gave up
her medical studies to marry him. She even inspired his first play. 'When my
wife was having a baby, I was very jealous; I felt excluded from some
mystery. Then one evening, in our flat in Camberwell, she was sitting in bed
knitting and I was struck by the sense that I had done nothing with my life.
It was that that set me to work.'
The result was The Hamlet of Stepney Green, an international success and the
archetypal Kops play, with its ghosts and songs and folk-lore; for, like
Chagall, he 'paints his dreams'. But the innovative stagecraft was no
academic experiment: 'It was all around me. My mother was a woman who, if
she couldn't express herself in language, would burst into song . . . Joan
Littlewood, who was supposed to direct the premiere, told me 'You may not be
aware but you've recreated traditional Yiddish theatre in this play.' I
replied: 'It didn't come from eastern Europe; eastern Europe comes from me.'
'
But success reawakened his demons. 'There's a problem. You're inspired by
the background you spring from and then you're cut off; so where do you draw
your sustenance? Until you stabilise yourself, you're left floating in a
miasma. Creativity leads you up some dark paths; you have to come to terms
with aggressive instincts and fears. The theatre is very dangerous when
you're vulnerable.'
After a second breakdown, it became too dangerous. He turned from plays to
novels. 'It's essential if you have a lot of creativity and energy to
continue working or else you get tied up inside and no new energy can find
you.' But, while he was protected from the theatre's public exposure, he
found the lack of feedback frustrating: 'There's never a sense of occasion,
a time when you think 'let's open the Australian champagne'.'
Over all the years and across the various media, his basic preoccupations
have remained constant. 'The underlying theme I think I've got is clinging
to the wreckage: how to survive the journey between life and death and not
to be mugged on the way - by yourself. Most people have similar desires and
fears. I'm interested in universalities and how to cope with it all.'
For a Jew of his generation, the overwhelming fear has been that of the
Holocaust. Even now his eyes fill with tears as he recalls the murder of
most of his Dutch family by the Nazis and the post-war compensation of
Pounds 5 from the German government. 'Pounds 5 for your entire family] I
knew a poet in Soho, who was on his uppers; so I gave it to him.'
He is currently confronting the evils of fascism in Dreams of Anne Frank, at
the Polka Young People's Theatre, Wimbledon. The play is suitable for anyone
over the age of 10, but he believes it essential to target a younger
audience. 'We underestimate the ability of children to take in such things.'
He feels a personal link with Anne in that his German translator, Rosey
Pool, had been her tutor before the war, and 'she often spoke to me of her.'
Meanwhile at Greenwich, Harry Landis and Joanna Lumley are appearing in the
two-hander, Who shall I Be Tomorrow?, about neighbours who enjoy an intense
relationship in Belsize Park. He heaps praise on the actors: 'Joanna
Lumley's so clever. The part is very threatening to her; she has great
courage in taking it on . . . and Harry Landis never resorts to that cliched
Jewish performance, which Solomon describes as 'the little Jewish tailor
with his glasses on, and the little Jewish tailor with his glasses off.'
Nor does Bernard Kops; one senses that all his performances are unique, even
though he inquires plaintively why so many Jewish writers of his age look
the same, describing himself as 'like Ben Gurion, but less wild'. He
continues to write obsessively. 'What drives me now is fear of the
scrapheap. I've always been very motivated. It goes back to the East End
where you had to be up and running. Even as a kid I had to cross the road
before everyone else.'
He has no plans to stop working. 'To me writing is like breathing; I hope
they both snuff out at the same time. I always have to have a project ahead
with a title; it's almost as if it's the only thing that proves a future.'
And he remains terrified of death. 'I'm not a religious man, not really; I
wish I could say not at all. I'm not afraid of the past and confronting my
ghosts, just of extinction. The idea of not being here to see my
grandchildren grow up seems an impertinence.'
Finally, conveying a strange blend of serenity and nervous energy, he
confesses: 'I'm not ambitious. I've lived the life that I want to live; all
I want is a continuation of the same. If you're enjoying a beautiful day
with people you love, you don't ever want it to end.'

FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Holy texts in the wink of an Indian eye - The ancient
dance form of Kathakali has come to the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From now until late November, UK audiences have the opportunity to see 'the
best artists in the world' - the dancers of the Kala Chethena Kathakali
Troupe from Kerala in South India.
The words are those of Kalamandalam Barbara Vijayakumar, the troupe's
co-director and the only woman and non-Indian ever to have qualified in the
art of Chutti - the elaborate make-up which, after a process of application
taking about four hours, transforms the actors into the representations of
characters from the Mahabharatha and the Ramayana which form the text of
this ancient form of dance drama.
Barbara Vijayakumar describes the art of Kathakali as 'like a mountain,
massive'. It is a mountain she has been scaling for nearly 20 years, having
discovered its existence entirely by chance. Dragged reluctantly on the
hippy trail to India, she got off at the wrong stop when travelling by train
between Cochin and Bangalore. As the train drew off into the distance, a man
approached her. 'Come and see our school,' he said. The school she
eventually discovered to be the Kerala Kalamandalam, the leading centre for
the teaching of this ancient art form.
Back home, Barbara, a student at Leeds College of Art, had been developing
her own dance drama, based on pure colour and light, and later established
her own company of performers, Centre Ocean Stream, which she still runs. A
serious problem was the dancers' make-up, which was always 'streaky', never
achieving the vivid, pure colours she required. On her arrival at the
mysterious 'school' in India, the first thing she saw was women students,
exquisitely made up, performing the female classical dance drama known as
Mohiniattam. She immediately asked if she could study there - and that was
before she had seen Kathakali proper. When she did, the serendipity was
complete.
Kathakali was for centuries the entertainment of kings and princes who vied
with each other to have the most lavish troupes. As royal power waned, and
the princes' coffers emptied, Kathakali came under threat and by early this
century the art was almost lost. Now funded by the government, it has been
revived to become a popular village art form, performed by travelling
troupes.
'As the sun sets, drummers go out to announce the performance,' Barbara
relates. 'Everyone comes, there is a festival atmosphere. Stalls are set up
around the performance area, everyone is coming and going. About nine
o'clock, the performers come out, lit with four floodlights with the music
broadcast through a horrible sound system with crackly speakers.'
Usually, the stage is set up outside the temple. If it is inside, even if
Barbara has done the make-up, she, a non-Hindu, cannot enter. For one of the
most profound aspects of the Kathakali performance - its role in binding
together communities by the representation and repetition of their holy
texts - is an experience that a western audience cannot share. The
performance of the complete Mahabharatha epic continues for four days. Whole
families attend, breaking for snacks, strolls and naps as the action
unfolds. Shorter performances run from early evening until dawn, when the
evil character is finally vanquished as the sun rises.
The present tour, which covers 29 venues in as many days, bravely attempts
to take Kathakali of the highest quality to the widest possible UK audience.
The troupe, founded in 1987 by Kalamandalam Vijayakumar, Barbara's husband
and one of the leading exponents of female roles, includes Kalamandalam
Gopi, honoured by the Indian government as one of the greatest exponents of
the art, and for many years the Guru (head teacher) of the Kalamandalam
school (the name of which is taken by former pupils as a mark of honour).
Certainly his performance as Nala is rivetting. He makes this extraordinary
being, resplendent in green face and glorious garb, a creature palpably
human as well as divine, full of tender emotion and concern for his wife,
Damayanti, played with convincing wiles by the excellent Vijayakumar.
With the colours of the mask-like make-up establishing the good or evil
nature of the characters, their story is told in mime, using a complex range
of facial and hand gestures which have developed over centuries into a
vocabulary of words and phrases. Perhaps most remarkable is the language of
the face - movements of the eyes, eyebrows and mouth give form to every
nuance of feeling and are miraculously visible even from the dress circle of
the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, where the performance I saw took place.
The movements and gestures include fast and furious passages of stamping and
leaping, closely related to the drumming and singing of four musicians,
which play a key role in setting the emotional atmosphere of each scene.
The quality of the performance of both actors and musicians ensures that
even with no knowledge of the esoteric stage language, the story comes
across clearly. Copious programme notes also help. Part of the charm of the
performance is the careful detail - the characters portrayed may be the
heroes and heroines of myth, but their emotions and misfortunes - in this
case marital happiness undermined by gambling losses (Nala wagers his
kingdom on a roll of dice and loses, condemning himself and his wife to
exile in the forest) - have a touchingly domestic feel. The affection
between Nala and Damayanti is clearly established, and their parting,
brought about by the machinations of the terrifying Kali, moving.
The most immediate impact, however, is visual. The combined effect of the
extraordinary make-up with costumes that are marvels of elaboration  -
panniered skirts in layers of white cotton embroidered in red and gold,
scarlet jackets under layers of beads and coloured scarves, towering carved
wooden headpieces painted red and gold and flashing with coloured stones -
makes the stately entrances of these larger-than-life figures, skirts
swirling to the thundering drums and clashing cymbals, truly breathtaking.
It is worth intercepting this remarkable spectacle as it makes its way
around the chilly 'villages' of Britain; history, beauty, spectacle and
performance skills of the highest order are always worth experiencing, and
these dedicated artists provide them in full measure.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Feydeau as tragedy - Malcolm Rutherford goes to the
World's End to see Janet Suzman direct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW theatre in London this week is concentrated in the capital's nooks and
crannies. After the magnificent Dutchman by Leroi Jones at the Albany Empire
in SE8, a little-known Noel Coward in at the King's Head in Islington and
Ibsen in Kentish Town, we have Janet Suzman, no less, directing a Feydeau
farce at the far (unfashionable) end of Chelsea's King's Road.
Suzman is a most accomplished actress who has played many of her best roles
with the Royal Shakespeare Company. The pedigree shows in her production.
She directs No Flies on Mister Hunter as if she is looking forward to
directing Othello or possibly even Otello.
Mister Hunter is not an hilarious play. Some of the jokes in this new
English version by Peter Kenvyn have clearly been written in. They are about
Fortnum and Mason, Chipping Sodbury and the Wigmore Hall. As a farce, it is
not in the same league as Feydeau's own A Flea in her Ear or the complete
works of Ray Cooney. There is a lot about trousers being lost and people
being embarrassingly in the wrong place at the wrong time. Most of the stock
elements are there, but as Suzman sees it, Mister Hunter is rather intense.
It is a play about marital infidelity, and some of the wounds hurt.
The set is black and white, very much in the current fashion of the London
stage. Tamsin Greig as Mrs Hunter is elegantly dressed - and never undressed
 -in black throughout. Even when the men change to less formal gear, their
trousers are in black and white check. The background of black and windows
and doors could be equally well designed for a modern production of Mozart
as for a Feydeau farce.
As a director, Suzman is experimenting, presumably wondering what she might
do next. Clearly she knows that one of the vices of the English theatre is
that lines are spoken too slowly. Some of the lines here come out
breathtakingly fast, yet retain their intelligibility: often the speed
enhances it. She also knows when to change pace. In a Noel Coward way, she
can put pathos into farce. The ending is terribly earnest.
The trouble is that the play is not quite up to it, or at least not up to
Suzman's serious treatment. The second half of the second of three acts is
quite intolerably long. One wonders what can possibly happen next, there
must, one assumes, be some kind of climactic denouement. In fact, nothing
much happens at all.
There are some wonderful performances, in particular, Alistair Petrie as the
impecunious Wodehousian young man. The star is Sally Mates who plays both
the maid and the so-called countess. She has a marvellous line about a
donkey.
The chief pleasure of the evening is watching Suzman on the learning path as
a director. She has picked up a farce and seen it as a potential tragedy. It
is a pity that you should have to go to World's End Place, which is the
precise address, to see it, but perhaps you should.
I rather enjoy such out of the way venues. They are where you see some of
the most interesting theatre in London. They are not attracting, however, a
regular, large theatre-going audience. Somehow we need more established
small theatres which are neither the West End nor huge institutions like the
Barbican and the National. It would be encouraging if Suzman could launch
the Chelsea Centre along such lines where other performers could try their
hand at directing.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Engraved in history - An exhibition and biography of
George Cruikshank, the influential Victorian caricaturist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUT OF the tens of thousands of drawings Cruikshank made during a long
working lifetime the two that remain lodged permanently in the mind of
posterity are 'Oliver Asking For More' and 'Fagin In The Condemned Cell'. In
the latter, the dim light filtering through the window-grill of a cell
illuminates the terrified figure sitting biting his nails on the narrow bed;
his eyes are popping in terror; his hat is placed upturned beside him; its
removal from his head shows us for the first time the shape of his skull,
and makes him seem curiously naked. Cruikshank's emphatic point is that
Fagin has not just been caught - he has been unmasked.
That illustration - one of 24 he did for Oliver Twist - is a fine example of
Cruikshank's love of melodrama. Born 200 years ago this year, he was an
actor manque having tried as a young man to get a job on the stage. He had
learnt the art of engraving at the knee of his father Isaac Cruikshank who
was of Scottish descent, but settled in London, a contemporary and colleague
of Rowlandson and Gillray. George was the second son, he had an older
brother Robert who was also a fine artist.
The theatre people told George Cruikshank that if he liked he could try his
hand at painting scenery. Cruikshank settled instead for caricature, an art
to which he brought a variety of skills combined with an infinite capacity
for invention. He eventually appeared on stage as an amateur, performing in
theatrical events organised by Dickens. The great novelist became a chum
when Cruikshank made the drawings for Dickens's first book Sketches by Boz.
Cruikshank always insisted that it was he who had originally had the idea
for Oliver Twist. He had, he claimed, given Dickens the story complete with
all the characters. This claim is the subject of an learned essay by Richard
A Vogler on the relations between author and artist printed in the symposium
Cruikshank edited by Robert L Patten in 1973. This valuable collection, with
an introduction by John Fowles and a cover design by Ronald Searle - both
are dedicated Cruikshankians - is now reissued by the Princeton University
Press at Pounds 15.95. After Oliver, Dickens and Cruikshank never worked
together again. It was Hablot Browne (Phiz) who became Dickens' regular
illustrator.
In his youth Cruikshank was a clubbable roisterer, but not a desperate one
like his father who died, after a life that combined excessive drinking with
great industry, at the age of 47. His son's career lasted almost twice as
long and in his late forties Cruikshank became a reformed character - or so
it seemed - through the influence of his second wife. From now on he
zealously promoted the teetotal cause. Sets of drawings by him with titles
like The Bottle, The Drunkard's Children, the Worship of Bacchus appeared
after the manner of Hogarth and were a huge success.
Before his conversion Cruikshank had combined conviviality with domesticity.
He married twice; both these unions were childless; but like Dickens,
Cruikshank, it came to light long after his death, had a clandestine
establishment near to his marital home where he kept a mistress who bore him
nine children.
The enormous range, the rollicking exuberance of his art with its love of
minute detail, may be sampled in the exhibition at the Museum of the Order
of St John, Clerkenwell, near where Cruikshank lived for some years. The
catalogue Cruikshank 200 (Pounds 5) by John Wardroper - the moving spirit
behind the exhibition - gives a useful concise account of the artist's life
and career.
On show are examples of his work as a radical, a scourge of the government
during the Regency period, alongside a handful of the many books and
pamphlets he illustrated. Several were published by his courageous friend
William Hone who vindicated the right of a publisher to disseminate such
subversive material in three separate historic libel actions brought by the
Lord Chancellor.
The exhibition also includes a fascinating selection of Cruikshank's
hand-coloured etchings, watercolours, pen-and-ink drawings. It is the first
comprehensive Cruikshank exhibition since the one organised by William
Feaver in 1978 at the V &amp; A to mark the centenary of the artist's death. In
these days of ever worsening unemployment figures, devalued currency, and of
Napoleonic gestures emanating from across the Channel, Cruikshank's
scurrilous and brilliant treatment of all these topics in such a manner as
to drive home their impact in human misery, seems as relevant to our time as
to his own.
Robert L. Patten, professor of English at Rice University, Texas, is the
leading academic Cruikshank scholar. Patten has been steadily researching
this biography for 20 years. The task included going through Cruikshank's
8,500 unpublished letters now dispersed in collections all over the world.
The biography will be published in two parts, the second will appear next
year. This first part takes us up to 1835. It covers the period when
Cruikshank established himself as the foremost British caricaturist of his
day; an artist whose work conditioned public awareness of political and
social events - at that period caricature had a similar importance to
television in our society.
Patten's mastery of the different disciplines in the career of such an
artist is apparent from the first chapter. He is always ready to expound the
national and international history behind the work, the Hundred Days,
Waterloo, Peterloo, the Reform Acts, the careers of the Prince Regent, the
Duke of Wellington - all of which were grist to Cruikshank's mill. Patten
also deals thoroughly with caricature as a form of folk art and he traces
the development of print-making techniques in the 19th century. It was
during the life of Cruikshank that book-illustration, to which he made such
a contribution, enjoyed one of its finest periods. As this volume ends,
Cruikshank has begun work on Scott's Waverley.
If the depth of insight into Cruikshank's life and art shown in volume one
is sustained in the concluding volume, as there is every reason to believe
it will be, then Patten's biography will surely become the indispensable
work on this ferocious but endearing artist.
Cruikshank 200 is open at the Museum of the Order of St. John, St John's
Gate, EC1, Monday to Saturday, 11am-4pm, until Oct 21. After that it will go
on tour to Burnley, Maidstone and Sheffield.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: A million miles from Mammy - Crazy cocktails of sound
are enlivening modern movies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all know what happened in 1927. Audiences were struck dumb by the sight
of a grown man opening his lips and saying 'Mammy]' The film was The Jazz
Singer, the man was Al Jolson. And the cultural milestone was the coming of
talking pictures.
'Talking' pictures. It is a perversity of history that the phrase has stuck.
For sound in cinema today means far more than human voices cluttering the
soundtrack with phonemes; or than those same human voices struggling between
dialogue scenes with the massed mayhem of a Hollywood score.
Go to a modern action feature and you will hear 570 varieties of breaking
glass, explosions and crunching cars; to a cartoon, and you'll be offered
umpteen permutations on the squawk, the thud, the bang, the screech; to a
horror film, and you'll experience an echo-chamber of subtle sonic scares
devised by mad sound scientists deep in their labs.
I met such a group on my last fact-finding visit to Tinseltown. Weddington
Productions in North Hollywood are top people in their business. They had
just finished working on Disney's Beauty And The Beast when I arrived
(opening in Britain this week) and before that they put the sonic overdrive
into films like Poltergeist, Raiders Of The Last Ark, Die Hard and Total
Recall.
At first I was given a verbal tour of the basics. How sound libraries grow
with each technologically groundbreaking film. (Total Recall added 80 new
tapes to a Weddington library now 3,800-strong.) How classic tapes are
handed down from age to age like 'Castle Thunder' from the 1931
Frankenstein, still in frequent use. How synthesisers and computers have
become part of the modern noise boffin's armoury.
But then my host Steve Flick (actual name) threw out a little observation
that I almost missed. 'We would mix animal noises into the breaking glass in
Die Hard . . .' Wait - animal noises in breaking glass? 'Yes.' What kind of
animal? 'Oh, Cougars, pumas, cat sounds. Just to give it that savage,
threatening feel.
'Glass has as many textures as a Persian carpet has colours. You can mix in
all sorts of things. Same with explosions. For Backdraft, which we didn't
work on, I understand they used pig squeals in the fireball noises.'
A new world began to unfold. Mixing sound effects into unlikely cocktails,
it became clear, is now one of the cinema's most surreal subdivisions.
'What else do you put animal noises into?'
'Well, when we did Raiders Of The Lost Ark Steven Spielberg wanted a
different sound for the scenes where Indiana Jones drives the truck: so that
the audience will sense there's more power, more machismo, than when the
villains drive it. So whenever Indy started up the engine, we put a lion's
roar into the noise. You can hear it clearly, even on video. But the
audience watching the film is so carried along by the story that it doesn't
notice.'
Animals are clearly worked hard at Weddington. Few of the company's most
impactful sound effects could have been completed without raiding the
nearest zoo or dogs' home. Take Gremlins, whose creature noises were created
by a fellow Weddington wizard, Mike Mangini.
'First we auditioned a lot of human actors. And we found one guy who could
make that high-pitched, squeaky, snarling sound we wanted. But we decided it
wasn't strong enough. So we rented some pit bulls and brought them into the
studio here. And we'd wrestle with them and tease them and tickle them under
the armpits until they gave us the noise we wanted.'
The mind boggles. But even this wins only a runner-up prize for
eccentricity. The company's finest hour probably came - they played the
original recording for me - when Steve Flick stepped into a bath of jello in
the early 1980s to create, by splashing around, the ploppy, gloopy
ectoplasmic effects for Poltergeist.
The empire of the sound effect spreads far and wide. It ranges from Heath
Robinson gewgaws that a child could build to state-of-the-art computer
equipment: like the Solid State Quantel screen-sound system I was shown
(British-made) where you 'touch in' effects on a soundtrack using a
light-pencil on a diagram-screen.
Meanwhile, the creative possibilities of the sound man's art include
everything from giving banal noises a distinctive flavour - 'Doors are very
important; we have over two hours of door sounds varied for the thickness of
the wood or the texture of the walls' - to collecting obscure instruments
from around the world. Flick proudly shook for me a 'Shinto noise-maker',
whose loose slatted structure, like an invertebrate xylophone, could enhance
any sound from a rattlesnake noise to the shudder of crockery during an
earthquake.
Mike Mangini has a DIY xylophone too. He invented it for Beauty And The
Beast and its 'keys' are dining spoons. Listen for it in the Disney
animation feature's big musical number, a Busby Berkeley dancing-dishware
extravaganza called 'Be My Guest'. Explains Mangini: 'We had to make sure
the sound effects didn't clash tonally with the music. So I made this
instrument like a xylophone where the spoons could be pitched to the key of
the music. And in the shot where you see the spoons diving into the
washing-up bowl, I'd hit them one after the other to create a kind of spoon
glissando.'
Mangini and assistant Dave Stone also laboured over the right cocktail of
technical and zoological effects for the Beast's voice. Actor Robby Benson's
voice was 'pitched down 15 per cent electronically, then we'd mix in
different growls from different animals. For 70mm prints we'd add in a
subharmonic frequency in the boom channel to create that extra rumble, and
on very strong words we even added explosion noise: for instance when the
Beast says to Beauty: 'You'll stay in there and you'll S-T-A-R-V-E]' '
Sound effects today, it's clear, are not just the art of sonic showmanship:
they create emotional underscorings often subtler than anything the image
could provide. For a scene of menace in the snowbound woods in Beauty And
The Beast, Mangini and Stone used slowed-down wolf howls to create the sound
of the wind. This not only enriched the sonic texture for its own sake, it
provided a portamento into the film's next narrative development, which was
a wolf attack. At their best, sound effects, like film music, provide a
whole new layer of meaning to a movie: reinforcing the pictorial image or
giving it a surprise inflection or even, as here, creating an entire
emotional ambience for it before it appears.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Truth disguised - Poetry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Slovenian poet Tomaz Salamun belongs to that post-war generation of
eastern European poets who grew up in a climate of intellectual dishonesty.
Stalinist societies in which public proclamations, always rosily optimistic,
bore little relation to the material and spiritual deprivations that they
experienced in their daily lives. The result was to drive the writers - and
the way they approached the problems of writing - underground.
Direct rebellion might be impossible, but important truths could be told -
and in Salamun's case, these were presented through a strange mixture of
whimsical, playful and almost absurd statements, too slippery for any censor
to take hold of.
Salamun's reading at the Voice Box this month - his first in London for many
years - tended to emphasise these characteristics of his poetry.
Speaking almost in an undertone, he read the majority of the poems in
English translation, which he spoke with an exaggeratedly careful emphasis.
The strange, fractured poems themselves, full of absurd humour, were quite
the antithesis of his sombre, formal appearance.
One of the longest and most accessible, The Fish, described, through a
sequence of starkly memorable statements - 'My names are all dirty'; 'On
some planet there is a central storehouse for my flesh' - a feeling of
worthlessness that seemed to border on the psychotic.
The title of another demonstrated just how playfully ironic Salamun could
be: 'Hear me out, the world is not in danger.' When one's inner and outer
worlds are under threat, the best way of drawing attention to that fact
might be to say the opposite.
Reading alongside Tomaz Salamun at the Voice Box that evening was Jo
Shapcott, a young English poet whose new collection, Phrase Book, was this
quarter's choice of the Poetry Book Society.
With hair flicked back behind her ears, and properly earthed in
Rumpelstiltskin boots, she seems to blaze with self-confidence - but, if
anything, the strength and sureness of her delivery draws too much attention
to the empty cleverness of her poetry. The reading becomes an exercise in
ensuring that the audience understands exactly as much as it needs to in
order to enjoy her poems to the full.
The poems all purported to be funny, with the poet entering into the psyches
of various sheep, a goat, Tom (of Tom and Jerry), Superman (in a bad mood),
a lettuce and a mad cow in order to describe for us how those various
animals and American cultural icons might feel and respond if they had the
kind of sophisticated intellect with which we humans are blessed.
Unfortunately, the jokes were often not good enough; and in one of the 'cow'
poems, the listener forgot entirely that the speaker was supposed to be a
cow at all. Jo Shapcott is a clever, artful constructor of poems - but
sometimes her head rules her heart and the sense of humour gets lost
altogether.
Charlie 'C K' Williams is one of the most distinctive American voices of our
time, and he is a rare, satisfying example of a poet who manages fully to
embody his poems in the reading of them.
The poet is in a state of extreme nervous agitation as he reads, perpetually
twisting his long neck from side, and pumping his shoe as if depressing some
imaginary organ pedal.
'I decided it was time to get a handle on jealousy,' he tells us, grinning,
before he attacks a poem entitled 'The Mirror', one of no fewer than 14
attempts to get to grips with this subject in his new collection, A Dream of
Mind.
His poetic lines are unusually long, and this adds to the sense of frenetic
drama in his mid-western voice. Every poem sounds like the last few
desperate furlongs of a close, hard-driven race, whether the subject matter
be a tramp or an analysis of the properties of the mind. The words
themselves seem to resonate through his body, causing every limb to twitch
and jerk. He is a poet to be read in gulps - desperate, driven, obsessive,
By the end the audience, mesmerised, is pawing the ground with its feet.
The Selected Poems of Tomaz Salamun are published by Ecco Press, New York.
Phrase Book by Jo Shapcott is published by Oxford University Press at Pounds
5.99.
A Dream of Mind is published by Bloodaxe Books at Pounds 6.95.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO 1 and Radio 2 have both been celebrating their 25th birthdays; but
radio anniversaries are not really worth celebrating, for they depend less
on intrinsic merit than on the judgment of the higher-ups. Radio 1 got three
spreads in the Radio Times and half-an-hour on BBC1. Radio 2 got nothing
like that, although Jimmy Young had a half-hour interview with David Frost
(on Radio 2).
Radio 2 is for the fairly uncritical lower middlebrow listener. True, music
tracks from the 1960s and later brought complaints, but not enough to ditch
them. The Jamesons, even Jimmy Young, may say controversial things now and
then, but they have their slots because they are everybody's friends, no
more contentious than the man on the Clapham omnibus. If I seldom write
about Radio 2 here, it is because those of its programmes that I hear are
deliberately uncontroversial. I doubt if Radio 2 will celebrate a 50th
anniversary. But I bet Radio 1 will.
Radio 3's play on Sunday was a winner, Fernando de Rojas's tragi-comedy La
Celestina, translated and adapted by John Clifford, who puts more fun into
16th century Spanish drama than anyone. Calisto (Jonathan Cullen) falls
madly for cautious Melibea (Abigail McKern) and has to ask help from the
local procuress, La Celestina, played with bewitching naughtiness by Frances
de la Tour.
The dialogue, in current English, is hilarious and bawdy. Most of the
principals finally die, as in Hamlet. Calisto falls down a cliff making a
covert exit from Melibea's home, and she kills herself in distress.
Calisto's tricky servants Sempronio and Parmeno (nice playing by Jonathan
Tafler and Matthew Morgan) murder Celestina for the wealth Calisto has paid
for her help, and are duly executed. Only the women servants and Melibea's
father, who has just one line, survive. The vigorously comic direction was
by Eoin O'Callaghan.
You Know It Makes Sense is a Radio 4 series on Wednesday mornings about the
five senses. Radio 2 did them in August, but less seriously. The Radio 4
lot, presented by Geoff Watts, explains how they work - the connection
between eyes and brain, the perception of colour. Watts mentioned various
ways in which vision is put to the test, through cameras, against modern
painting and so on. Next week, touch. Taste we have had, often enough,
although in other circumstances.
Talking of taste, on Tuesdays on Radio 4, Miles Kington is giving a world
survey of humour, It's a Funny Old World. The snag is that one only laughs
at foreign people's jokes if they are funny by our standards. Last week, we
met the Nigerians, who often have the useful advantage of knowing English.
Nigerian joke electricity comes from the NEPA, or National Electric Power
Authority, so Nigerians say NEPA stands for Never Expect Power at All.
This week we were in India, where, as in Nigeria they laugh at people from
other regions. Funniest are Sikhs - Sikh jokes are the equivalent of Irish
jokes in England. Indian cartoons illustrate politics. Indian cartoon: the
goalkeeper in an Indian football team has to accommodate all his family in
the goal. Kington is very sympathetic, and is not tempted to make jokes of
his own.
Next week we go to China, but this is strictly Indian week, for in the slot
where we had the Bible readings, we now have readings from the Bhagavad
Gita. I have heard three days' worth, and very interesting too, but so
different from religious writing in Britain that I dare not offer any
critical comment without first learning a lot more. Shall we later come to
the Koran?

<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, the UK-based engineering group, should produce a trading
profit of Pounds 20m when it announces preliminary profits on Monday before
an exceptional gain of Pounds 90m from its pension fund refund.
The group is, however, expected to announce exceptional restructuring
provisions of Pounds 60m. It should maintain its dividend.
Body Shop International will try on Tuesday to repair some of the damage
last month's profits warning did to its share price. Bringing a record of
unbroken profits growth to an abrupt halt, the cosmetics' retailer said
interim pre-tax profits would be not less than Pounds 8m (Pounds 9.1m) and
the 0.68p dividend would be maintained.
The shares fell 108p to 158p on the news and, so far, have recovered to only
170p. Investors will be particularly anxious to hear how UK sales are going.
Body Shop said last month that some store sales were down between 3 and 5
per cent over the past three months.
Who will end up owning Mirror Group Newspapers remains unresolved nearly a
year after the mysterious death of Robert Maxwell but, despite the
uncertainty, the business is still performing well.
Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 18m
for the half year when the results are announced on Tuesday. A result
towards the top end is likely.
Highland Distilleries, maker of The Famous Grouse, the UK's second
best-selling Scotch whisky, is expected to report full year pre-tax profits
on Monday virtually unchanged from last year's Pounds 28m.
Lloyds Chemists, the second largest retail chemists' chain after Boots, is
expected to report on Thursday pre-tax profits for the year to June of about
Pounds 35m.
The rise from Pounds 20.8m a year earlier reflects in large part the group's
ambitious programme of acquisitions.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Better news at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was good news this week for those Lloyd's Names facing difficulties
because of the market's record losses. Lloyd's announced changes to its
'hardship arrangements' which lighten the burden of Names unable to meet
their obligations. The changes remove the prospect of lifelong indebtedness.
According to Dr Mary Archer, chairman of the members' hardship committee,
they will make hardship a more attractive prospect than bankruptcy, the
alternative course for Names in trouble.
Up to now, Names benefiting from hardship relief signed an agreement with
Lloyd's whereby it would take a charge on their income and their assets for
life, or until their debt was repaid. The Name typically would be allowed to
retain an annual income of Pounds 15,000 and a modest house valued at around
Pounds 150,000.
Where Names depend on investment income, Lloyd's converts assets into a
hardship deposit trust fund, earmarking an annual amount to Names - again,
typically around Pounds 15,000.
Under the new arrangements, Names would still need to sell most of their
assets to meet their loss, and may have to move to a cheaper home. But Names
in hardship would benefit in a number of ways. Hardship would cease at the
end of three years leaving Lloyd's with the charge on the Name's property,
as well as any proceeds from Lloyd's-related litigation and tax recoveries.
Names would then be free to build up assets and pay off the charge on their
principal residence. Those still working would retain all their earnings,
but Names would also get the the full benefit of any windfall income.
Names relying on investments as their main source of income would benefit,
too, although they would continue to get roughly the same level of income
from their hardship trust.
The creation of a Pounds 50m fund, financed by contributions from brokers
and agents, means that Lloyd's can supplement Names' income when necessary.
Money from this fund can be used for several purposes. These include buying
annuities on behalf of a member; paying income to the spouse of a deceased
member; buying 'necessary domestic commodities'; and paying certain school,
nursing home or retirement home fees, and medical expenses.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Insurance giant in probe on policies -
Unsuitable products may have been sold / Problems at Scottish Widows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 20,000 policyholders with Scottish Widows, the life assurance
company, are likely to have received a letter in the past fortnight telling
them they may have bought an unsuitable product.
The policies were sold by its tied agents - financial advisers who sell the
products of one company exclusively but are not employed by it directly.
Scottish Widows has been obliged by Lautro (the Life Assurance and Unit
Trust Regulatory Organisation) to recheck them after a compliance check in
April disclosed that some agents had gathered too little information on
policyholders to be able to offer 'best advice.'
The problem centres on client Factfinds undertaken by Scottish Widows' 130
or so tied agencies. A Factfind is a questionnaire detailing the financial
circumstances of an individual (the adviser is required by the Financial
Services Act to obtain a completed Factfind from a client before being able
to recommend an insurance or any other investment product).
In the case of a subsequent dispute, the Factfind can be used as evidence to
show, for example, that a client was sold a commission-rich, whole-of-life
policy when a building society account might have been more suitable.
The preliminary review, completed by Scottish Widows in August, was of just
under 27,000 Factfinds carried out by tied agents since February 1989. It
revealed that only 6,200 were totally satisfactory; hence the requirement
for further, more detailed checks.
The review showed that well over 20,000 policies sold by tied agents may not
comply with Lautro rules. Of these, 17,500 are cases in which Scottish
Widows is unable to decide whether a suitable product has been sold because
of incomplete information on the policyholder's Factfind. People in this
category are being asked by the company to fill in a mini-Factfind form.
Another 3,240 people are likely to have been sold an unsuitable policy and
have been asked by Scottish Widows to contact one of its sales consultants.
If an unsuitable product is found to have been sold, Scottish Widows will
try to replace the policy. But if it does not have a suitable policy
available, or if a life product was not the best form of investment for its
policyholders, the company will be obliged under the Financial Services Act
to restore them to the financial situation in which they would have been had
they not taken the contract. Affected policyholders should, therefore, make
sure that they are happy with any alternative new arrangements before
agreeing to them.
Scottish Widows, which sold just under 129,000 policies last year, is one of
the UK's 10 top-performing life insurance and pensions houses. It said this
week: 'Our immediate objective is to ensure that our customers have been
given the correct advice.
'If they have not, then we will act fairly and quickly to ensure any
problems are resolved effectively.' It has promised Lautro that complete
Factfinds will be carried out by November 30.
Scottish Widows is now making big changes. 'To ensure this does not happen
again, we have reviewed all our systems and procedures,' said the company.
'We are also introducing a redesigned Factfind and a revised and more
exacting training programme.'
Meanwhile, Scottish Widows has reduced steadily the number of its tied
agents - from 184 at the end of last year to 130 today.
Lautro official Mike Abrahams said many life companies had met problems with
tied agents because of 'separateness.' He added: 'Tied agents are not a part
of the company's direct sales force and are separate in terms of management
and work ethos.'
Scottish Widows gets 90 per cent of its sales through IFAs, who can
recommend the products of any company. It is, therefore, vulnerable to a
fall in business should its performance falter. The company is now
concentrating on creating a direct sales force, which is scheduled to be in
place at the beginning of next year.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel: The Braden way to heaven - Patrick Harverson learns
new tricks from a US ski guru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU ARE cold, frustrated and angry. Anyone who has taken ski lessons in
Europe will know the feeling. Cold, because you have been standing around on
the mountain watching other people fall over. Frustrated, because the
instructor keeps shouting 'bend zee knees' and you are still not getting any
better, either at bending zee knees or at skiing. Angry, because you have
paid good money for an archaic Alpine form of public humiliation. Instead of
locking you into unusually-shaped pieces of wood and throwing snow at you,
they lock you into unusually-shaped pieces of wood and throw you at the
snow.
In America, thankfully, they do it differently. Take the Vic Braden Ski
College in Aspen, Colorado, where they take the 'school' part of 'ski
school' seriously. When I signed up for the five-day skiing course I
received an introductory video, a recommended reading list, assigned
exercises, and warnings about what to wear and how to avoid altitude
sickness. I watched the video, read the book list (but none of the books),
skipped the exercises (more fool me) but packed the longjohns and extra
sweater.
The brains behind the Vic Braden Ski College, not surprisingly, belong to
Vic Braden. A licensed psychologist and US tennis coach, Braden is known for
his offbeat approach to sports teaching and the college is a response to
what he found when he tried to learn skiing: that the quality of teaching
varies widely, and that skiers rarely receive the attention they deserve
from instructors.
On our arrival Braden was not there to welcome us in person, but he did
appear on video to provide cheery encouragement at the orientation meeting,
which opened like a group therapy session - 20 people seated in a
semi-circle, nervously providing a brief resume of their skiing experience
and hopes for the week.
The first day at any school is tough, but a few in the group were alumni and
offered some words of comfort. George from Connecticut attended the college
a year ago: 'Last time I got my legs and arms. I'm back to find the rest of
my body.'
Fear was our common denominator. Fear of difficult blue runs, steep black
runs, moguls, ice. Some were scared of going too fast, others of going too
slow. Fear reached other areas, too. Should longjohns go inside, or outside,
socks?
There to answer these questions, and ask some of their own, were John,
Muriel, Owen, Chris and Mary, the college's coaches. Their questions were
tougher than ours. How do balance movements relate to skiing? How do you
edge the ski? What happens to skis when you turn?
This is where the school part came into its own. The coaches conducted part
of each lesson in the classroom. Using flip sheets, videos and various
platforms and devices to simulate skiing, they explained the physical
relationship between hips, knees, ankles, feet, boots, skis and snow. Making
sense of it all on the slopes was another matter. The challenge was to blend
skills that on their own appear simple, but when applied together can
produce mental and physical overload.
After the theory, it was time for the practical. We headed for the
well-groomed slopes of Tiehack/Buttermilk mountain, which sits wedged
between Ajax, Aspen Highlands and Snowmass in the four-mountain ski area of
Aspen.
The group had been divided according to ability, and the coach assigned to
our class of five was Muriel Frei, a delightful Swiss instructor. Muriel
trained in Switzerland as a physical education teacher and brought something
of the schoolmistress to her ski classes, asking questions which quickly
made us realise that we had no idea what were doing - right or wrong - when
we skied.
Under Muriel's persistent probing, our control and technique improved. Each
day ended with discussion of the skills we had worked on and an opportunity
to watch ourselves on video, a sometimes painful experience that yielded at
least one important lesson: I needed a new ski suit.
The coaches also introduced some innovative concepts, such as 'centering', a
technique borrowed from the martial art, aikido. Centering involves
discovering your 'one-point' - the physical centre of your body. In most
cases, this is somewhere near the belly button. By focusing our minds on the
spot while we skied, we would have better control over our balance.
That was the theory, and although it was easy to find your one-point in the
classroom, it was trickier to think of your belly button while bouncing down
a mogul field. There were also breathing exercises (it is astonishing how
many people hold their breath when skiing difficult slopes).
Each coach had their own style; moguls were a case in point. One coach
taught his nervous charges to think of the moguls as 'turn enhancers'.
Another recommended growling at them on the way down, while Muriel took a
more conciliatory approach, suggesting we treat the moguls as 'our friends'.
The week passed quickly and by Thursday most of us were showing signs of
real improvement. George from Connecticut had finally found his body,
although we were not sure if he knew where his head was. On the penultimate
day Vic Braden arrived to give us a pep talk. This is a man who knows his
pep, and he delivered a boisterous account of his teaching philosophy, which
can be distilled in a single slogan: 'Laugh and learn.'
Braden finished with a favourite quote from Charlie Chaplin: 'A day without
laughter is a day wasted.' After a week spent learning to dance with the
mountain, love my belly button and make friends with a mogul, not a day went
to waste.
Patrick Harverson flew to Colorado with Continental Airlines and stayed at
the Inn at Aspen in Buttermilk (tel: 303 925 1500). The fee for a five-day
course at the Vic Braden Ski College is Dollars 695 (Pounds 390) which
includes lift tickets. For information ring: 303 920 0784.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel: Hungary on course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN PILLEY

<TEXT>
ONCE tourists took only old jeans and Beatles albums to Hungary. Now they
are taking golf bags. Once the locals spent their weekends queuing for
petrol. Now they queue to tee-off.
Within two years the Hungarian Open could be established. That is the dream
of a Hungarian-born golf fanatic who lives and plays most of his golf in the
middle of the Pacific. He probably has to travel further from his home to
his golf club than anyone in the world.
Dezco Hafnal is president of the Hungarian Golf Association and the man
behind Budapest Golf Park and Country Club, a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.1m)
project on the picturesque island of Szentendre, 35 kms north of Budapest.
He spends six months there and the rest of the year in Honolulu, where he is
a 12-handicap member of the Hawaii Golf Club.
'There has always been some kind of golf played in Hungary, usually by
diplomats, ex-pats, service people and the high society, but now more locals
and tourists are getting interested in the game,' said Hafnal.
In 1956 Hafnal, the son of a Budapest hairdresser, moved to British Columbia
in Canada where he became a member of the Uplands and Victoria golf clubs.
He became involved in property projects in the US and Canada and saw the
potential of building a golf course in his home country. His dream came true
when the Szentendre course opened in 1988. Hafnal wants to bring a permanent
teaching professional from Britain for the opening of the courses's back
nine holes next year.
It won't be me. The course is tight and has some idiosyncratic hazards which
proved too much for my west European game. At the moment the longest hole is
the 410-metre fifth and the shortest the 153 metre seventh. I came to grief
on the fourth which has pepper fields down the right hand side of the
fairway. I pushed one in there and found that I could not see the green - my
eyes were watering too much.
Green fees are Pounds 16 and membership Pounds 266. There are plenty of
moderately-priced and comfortable guest-houses close to the course, as well
as some excellent spa hotels. For luxury you could stay in the Grand Hotel
Corvinus, which opened recently in Buda.
You can play at Budapest Golf Club from April 1 to October 31. It has a
friendly and cosmopolitan atmosphere and you can find yourself talking a
good game in the clubhouse afterwards with almost anyone from the local
paprika mogul to the bored wife of a hussar. There are two other golf
courses in Hungary: a nine-hole course at Pecs, in the south, and an
18-holer at Buk.
There is no reason why golf in Hungary cannot be a success, says Dr Gati of
the Hungarian Golf Association. 'Russia has a golf course. So does Poland.
Romania even has four or five courses. So does Czechoslovakia.'
A new course near the famous German tourist attraction of Lake Balaton to
the west of Budapest will shortly be under construction, and Hafnal has been
approached by a German group to draw up plans for another complex.
Once, most of Hungary was out of bounds. Now only parts of it are.
For further information about golf in Hungary: contact Danube Travel in
London: 071-493-0263. For information and flight reservations to and from
Budapest, contact Malev Hungarian Airlines at 10 Vigo Street, London WI,

FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel: No surrender on the ski slopes - Arnold Wilson
previews the new season and finds that bookings are up in spite of
sterling's woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE HAVE seen this extraordinary syndrome before and this autumn we are
seeing it again: although as a result of the free-falling pound the British
may consider sacrificing their summer holiday, come hell, high water, or
Helmut Kohl, they will not retreat from the ski slopes of Europe . . . or
the US, come to that.
After the most consistent snow for a decade in Europe last winter, tour
operators are reporting remarkably brisk early bookings - excellent in some
cases, and traditional worries about the possible lack of snow at Christmas
and New Year seem to have evaporated.
With the ailing pound and dollar entwined in a trans-Atlantic embrace in
which they seem set to sink or swim together, bookings to the US are looking
even better than last year in spite of an indifferent winter for snow in the
Rockies.
However, Vail is no longer automatically the most popular destination. Some
British skiers seem keen to explore more exotic destinations such as Jackson
Hole and Telluride.
Ski Solutions (081-944-1155) the specialist ski 'travel agent', provides a
barometer of this British preoccupation with skiing at all costs. 'We are 30
per cent up on last year in terms of people, but 64 per cent up in money,'
says Lizzie Norton, managing director.
'A lot of people are choosing holidays that are at least 25 per cent more
expensive. The general feeling is that people scrimped last year and many
had bad experiences. For the sake of spending a bit more, they really do get
more comfort and service.
'Last year they also tended to leave booking too late and were frequently
disappointed. They often had to take second or third choice of hotel or
chalet as their first choice was already booked. However, in the top resorts
like Courchevel, Zermatt and Verbier, people do seem to be prepared to stay
in accommodation that is further away from the slopes, and therefore
cheaper, in order to have access to good skiing.'
The French are hoping to overhaul their rivals, Austria - which
traditionally attracts more British skiers than any other country - and may
even end up neck and neck. With frontiers virtually removed in 1993 the
French are planning to bring back heliskiing direct from French resorts for
the first time since 1975. Thus - ironically during a recession - specialist
ski schools like Top Ski and Evolution de 2 in Val d'Isere/Tignes hope once
again to be offering skiing encounters of the most expensive kind. They will
still have to land just over the border in Italy because of environmental
pressures, but they will no longer have to fly to Aosta or La Phuile first.
* * *
The Albertville Olympics may be over but the French, anxious to keep the
Olympic flame burning in hearts and minds, are offering a new Olympic lift
pass enabling skiers who book a full-price six day ticket in any of the
major Olympic areas to ski in two others.
For this purpose, the Trois Vallees resorts of Courchevel, Meribel, Les
Menuires and Val Thorens will be dubbed l'Espace Trois Vallees. La Plagne
and neighbouring Les Arcs will form another 'Espace'. The Val d'Isere and
Tignes common skiing area has long been christened 'l'Espace Killy.'
Skiers in any of the three Espaces will now be able to spend one day in each
of the other two. Thus, if you buy a six day pass in Val d'Isere , for
example, you can use it to ski for a day in the Three Valleys and a day in
La Plagne or Les Arc at no extra cost.
It is well worth noting - especially for larger families and groups - that
by pre-booking your lift pass from many tour operators (those whose current
brochures promise 'no surcharges') you can still take advantage of pre
'black Wednesday' prices, which are now substantially cheaper than the price
you will pay in the resort next winter.
A six day pass costing FFr1,870 for the Espace Killy is still available at
the old exchange rate of 9.71 francs to the pound recommended by ABTA
earlier this year, so you can still pre-book your lift pass for under Pounds
90. At the present exchange rates, you would have to pay more than Pounds
107 in resort.
Skis and boots are also worth pre-booking at the old rate. Crystal, which
cleverly uses the word 'approximate' to describe its brochure prices, have
now upped the cost of a lift pass in l'Espace Killy from Pounds 86 to Pounds
92 and ski and boot hire from Pounds 46 to Pounds 55. But Touralp (Pounds 89
lift pass, Pounds 37skis and boot hire) and Nielson (Pounds 91 lift pass,
Pounds 46 skis and boot hire) honour their brochure prices. Market leader
Ski Thomson, which pre-books equipment but not lift passes, also sticks to
its ski and boot hire rate of Pounds 47.
With some tour operators already toying with reprinting their brochures with
higher prices, booking now makes sense. There are only just over 60 booking
days till Christmas.

LONDON: A LITERARY COMPANION edited by Peter Vansittart John Murray Pounds
16.95, 311 pages
ONLY ONE other city approaches London's richness in literary associations,
and that is Paris. But London wins the comparison. It is the greatest of
Europe's cities and until lately the capital of the largest empire the world
has seen. For centuries the talented and ambitious flocked to it. One has
only to read Henry James's account of his excited arrival in London to
appreciate the city's attractive power. From Chaucer and Shakespeare to Shaw
and James, aspirants were drawn to it as moths to a flame.
Because of this London's very stones are soaked with historical and literary
associations, so that to walk the great city is to go among a throng of
magnificent ghosts, quickened and prompted in one's perceptions by the
bodies of work they left behind: poetry and prose.
To explore such treasures of literary association one needs a good guide. In
this book we get the best possible. Fans of Peter Vansittart's work will
know his genius for choosing apt quotations and the exact and exquisite
economy of his introductions to them. Here we get his masterwork in this
genre. It is as if he had commissioned the best writers of the last several
centuries to provide him with paragraphs for this book, so exactly does each
selection fit. The result is a cornucopia of good things.
Vansittart begins by introducing us to the multiplicity of London. There are
Londons of myth, history and literature; Londons in fog and heat; Londons
for the rich, the poor and strangers; Londons in turmoil and Londons asleep.
After giving us a bird's-eye view Vansittart takes us down the river and
along the streets of these Londons, river and streets winding through time
as through space, crowded at every turn with ghosts.
Almost all the journeys begin at Piccadilly Circus. London is too vast to
have a centre, Vansittart remarks, but something must serve as a
starting-point. So from Eros we go south-west to Victoria, meeting Phineas
in Parliament and the shades in Poet's Corner. From Eros again we pass
through Covent Garden to Ludgate Hill, St Paul's, the City, and beyond,
seeing Moll Flanders in Smithfield and Boswell marvelling at the Monument.
Again from Eros we go to the Southwark of Shakespeare and Dickens and points
south; from Eros again up Regent Street to Marble Arch and - calling on West
London's literary hostesses for refreshment en route - thence to Notting
Hill, whence Wyndham Lewis issued his Blasts. And finally we go from Eros to
Bloomsbury and the northern lights of Highgate and Hampstead, where today's
scribblers dwell.
Every page bursts with delights; in them London pulses into life and one
feels that Johnson's remark about what it means if one is tired of London
applies equally to this book. It is in the truest sense a companion. The
literary pilgrim will find it invaluable, the browser will find it a
treasury. Anthologies and guides come and go, but this will prove a classic
of its kind.

THE CALL OF THE TOAD by Gunter Grass Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 248
pages
THE PROFESSOR hero of Gunter Grass's new novel is nicknamed Jeremiah, a
reproach often levelled at his creator. The Call of the Toad - a funny,
wise, hugely enjoyable fantasy - confirms Grass as Germany's most eloquent
literary prophet.
Since the Tin Drum in 1959, Grass has transformed figures from European folk
tales into potent symbols for his distrust of 20th-century Germany, and has
written a string of anarchic, warning novels. The fable titles - The Rat,
Cat and Mouse - are giveaways; there was also a malevolent black hound in
Dog Years; a feminist fish in The Flounder; an elusive snail, metaphor for
political change, in the 1970s; and, most famously, the dwarf Oskar who
refuses to grow up in amoral Nazi Germany in The Tin Drum.
With The Call of the Toad, Grass brings the fable landscape of the Europe of
his lifetime up to date. At once a satire on post-1989 politics and a love
story, it shows two sides of the author: firebrand and mellowed, humane
observer.
In the Tin Drum, sex was as sordid as the regime that encompassed it; 30
years on, the heart of this new piece is the romantic meeting between
Alexandra and Alexander, both widowed, at the Gdansk market just before the
fall of the Berlin wall. She is a Pole exiled from Lithuania; he, like
Grass, is a German born in the city when it was Danzig and now exiled in
west Germany. She is a gildress, he an expert tomb restorer. From a double
optimism - their art and their late-blooming love - emerges an ironic
fantasy.
The couple found a Cemetery of Reconciliation for German natives of Gdansk
to be buried in the city, and for Poles to be buried in Lithuania. But the
idea takes off too quickly; speculators move in, the powerful Deutschemark
devours plots all over Gdansk. There are vulgar re-burials and
recrimination. Capitalism defeats idealism: a metaphor for present west-east
relations and the too-hasty German reunification, against which Grass
campaigned from the start.
As in the Tin Drum, his masterstroke is to interpret horror through a
so-called image which amuses without being flippant. Satirical echoes crash
through the pages. At the lyrical core is a folklore parallel: the call of
the toad, which the couple record on the Baltic estuaries, by superstition
foreshadows disaster. In 1990, the toad calls too early in the spring; by
1999, the nightmare is of 'a spanking new bicycle rickshaw with a toad as
passenger, rolling in the direction of the future.'
Grass's novels are always embellished by the same grotesque chorus - fish,
eels, toads, snails, boletus mushrooms squirm like details from German
expressionist paintings, the edible or vegetable now animate, now
transformed into a human face. Among contemporaries, only the novelist
Garcia Marquez equals him as an image-maker.
Stone by stone, rivulet by mudbank, Danzig and the Baltic coast build up
into the poetic symbol and creative spring of all Grass's work; like Joyce's
Dublin or Bashevis Singer's Poland, they are the dream home of the exiled
writer, evoked half a century on with the microscopic precision of a guide
book. But they are also an historical symbol.
In the Tin Drum and Cat and Mouse, Danzig is the backcloth for Grass's
dissection of nazism; it was also the prize at the end of the Polish
Corridor for which Hitler began the second world war. In the 1980s, unrest
in Gdansk's shipyards heralded the end of communism in eastern Europe. In
The Call of the Toad, Gdansk citizens are guilt-ravaged but on the make, and
the city loses its soul to the Deutschmark:
Danzig holds the novel together like a magnet; taut yet exuberant, complex
yet clear as a nursery rhyme, endlessly inventive, its themes pull always
back to this central image. Translated by the masterly Ralph Manheim (who
died so recently) into limpid, lively prose,The Call of the Toad shows Grass
as one of our greatest living storytellers.

AN EVIL CRADLING by Brian Keenan Hutchinson, Pounds 16.99, 256 pages
WE ARE lucky, in retrospect, that Lebanon's hostage was someone as
articulate as Brian Keenan. Our good fortune has the kind of irony that the
author of An Evil Cradling, whose senses of proportion and humour and
curiosity seem to have survived 4 1/2 years of random torment remarkably
intact, just might appreciate. Without self-pity and without pandering to
voyeurs of human pain, his story surprises by emerging as one of love as
much as of anguish.
The true subject of the book, its preface tells us, is how in the most
inhuman of circumstances men grow and deepen in humanity. It is an honest
claim. One of Keenan's defences against the 'gross indignity' inflicted on
him was to try and split his being to see things with distance. Perhaps
because of this, the book's real voyage is not so much into the dungeons of
Beirut and the Bekaa as into the minds and emotions of Keenan, his fellow
hostages and their jailers.
Beginning with a sketch of a gloomy Belfast youth, the story balloons in
detail with the description of his abduction only four months after arriving
in Beirut to teach English literature.
At first he is thrown into solitary confinement, a trial so severe that
further years of brutalisation pale by comparison. Keenan evokes the
extraordinary power of the imagination to create worlds, a power which can
terrify to the point of madness. 'I sat upon that foam mattress and it
became for me a raft in a vast sea,' he writes.
Later his dark cell fills with imaginary birds: 'Their frightened flight
seemed endless. These birds flew backwards, flew upside down . . . I found
myself hissing 'Enough, enough' as I tried to flail my way out of that
insane aviary.'
From this horror Keenan is rescued by the sudden arrival of his companion of
the following years, John McCarthy. Their meeting is memorable. A growing
friendship clearly not only sustains but enriches them.
It is this love that saves them from the worse degradation of their fellow
captives and even allows them to pity their tormentors. Fear of separation
comes nearly to outgrow their will to be free. In some way they are able to
turn their cell inside out, to reverse roles with the world beyond.
Mercifully, Keenan spares us excessive detail of the humiliations inflicted
by his guards. More often he dwells on their troubled and impoverished
psyches, their self-loathing that translates into a fetishism for violence
and a desperation for love.
His sallies into the murky politics of Lebanon, too, are human-scale. He
recalls watching a Rambo cheapie at a Beirut cinema before his capture, when
he was appalled to find the teenage audience excitedly cataloguing the
weaponry.
During his extended nightmare Keenan was moved 17 times. Some quarters were
relatively comfortable, some wretched. It was the process of moving that was
most painful. Each time, inevitably, hopes for release would rise and then
crash. Mummified with packaging tape and trussed with chains, he would be
shoved into a dust and exhaust choked compartment under the chassis of a
truck, 'Like bread into an oven.' Struggling to breathe over a six-hour
journey was like being 'A child trying to escape from the ever tightening
carcass of a dried-up womb.'
A prison story without a great escape is unusual, and might have been too
bleak a thing to contemplate. Keenan and McCarthy tried at every opportunity
to get out. But if they failed to break their physical confinement, they
succeeded heroically in every other way.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Books: Ghote has wife trouble - Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR YEARS, HRF Keating has created taxing problems for his long-suffering
(and happily long-lived) Inspector Ghote to solve, working against the
forces of evil and the chaotic inertia of Bombay. When Keating began this
series he had never been to India. Since its deserved success, he has
visited the country, but the reader cannot help asking: was this trip
necessary? For, like many gifted authors, Keating has invented a country to
suit his purposes.
The people of this made-to-order India speak a language that echoes the
peculiar English of the subcontinent, but is not a etymologist's
transcription. Keating is careful, too, to keep its quaintness within
tolerable confines; he does not use it solely for humour. His latest Ghote,
Cheating Death (Hutchinson, Pounds 13.99, 172 pages) is exemplary in this
respect: he makes tempered fun of academic pretentions, in both students and
professors; but he respects wisdom and intelligence. Only two
miscalculations: he sets up two running jokes (one involves Ghote's
determination to beat his wife, the other harps on the Inspector's
misunderstanding of a quotation from Shakespeare). Neither is particularly
funny; both outstay their welcome.
Michael Pearce has produced a fifth novel in his series about Edwardian
Egypt and the British administration. The Mamur Zapt and the Girl in the
Nile (HarperCollins, Pounds 13.99, 224 pages) is perhaps the best. As usual,
the author displays not only an uncanny knowledge of complex Anglo-Egyptian
relations, but also a subtle social sense, a grasp of fine distinctions, an
elaborate code. Here, too, language is cogently employed.
Inspector Thomas Pitt and his 'better born' wife Charlotte are the familiar
leading performers in Anne Perry's novels set in Victorian London. The
latest, Bluegate Fields (Souvenir Press, Pounds 14.95, 308 pages), is
somewhere between a Police Operational (1880s style) and a court room drama.
Social taboos and distinctions play an important role here, too, especially
as the circumstances of the murder, involving homosexuality, are considered
not so much distasteful as unmentionable. The keen reader will probably spot
the murderer early on, but that is not the point. It is the search for truth
that counts, not the punishment of the guilty.
In her Conan Doyle pastiches, June Thomson relies heavily on imitating the
Holmes-Watson dialogues of the real stuff and succeeds in establishing the
proper claustrophobic atmosphere, adding a touch of mock authenticity with
footnotes, foreword by a modern Dr Watson, and so on. In The Secret
Chronicles of Sherlock Holmes (Constable, Pounds 12.99, 203 pages) the
mysteries are enjoyable, though less ingenious than the verbal and visual
reconstruction of the period and the style.

G M TREVELYAN: A LIFE IN HISTORY by David Cannadine HarperCollins, Pounds
18, 288 pages
TREVELYAN IS by far the best book that David Cannadine has written. It is
well, if somewhat oddly, constructed. It neither bulges nor drifts. It is
compact and the style colourful and emphatic as one would expect, but more
sober than his journalism.
The character of Trevelyan and his role in the writing of history have never
been better described. Cannadine has had access to a wider range of archival
material than was available to earlier researchers on Trevelyan's life and
work and he has used this with great skill not only to correct errors but
also to fill out Trevelyan's somewhat arid private life. The book has one
oddity which I particularly dislike and find mannered and rather silly; each
chapter has a picture of a building or landscape and a paragraph of rather
wrought prose explains its significance to Trevelyan's life.
The book's first chapter covers comprehensively, but briefly, the life and
work and beliefs of Trevelyan. It is a masterly summary and could exist in
its own right: if detached from the book it would make a most useful
pamphlet for undergraduates.
This is followed by four chapters dealing with facets of Trevelyan's
extremely active and productive life: The Liberal Internationalist; The Whig
Constitutionalist; The Rural Elegist; The Historian and the Reputation.
Obviously there is some repetition. Trevelyan was a man of remarkable
honesty with a deep sense of the moral duties both of the rich and the
gifted He spoke his mind bluntly; he wrote sensitively about history. He
sought the wisdom it contained and brooded on the almost insoluble problems
he found, not only in the world about him, but also in his own vulnerable
heart.
He discovered the depths of his own personality in the isolation and loss
that history embodies, yet his pessimism was tempered. Although a good Whig
historian, Trevelyan never thought that the moral improvement of humanity
would be commensurate with progress in science, technology, food supplies,
transport and human organisation, yet he would probably have maintained that
some moral progress had been made particularly by the Western industrialised
powers over the last few centuries. This may have been hard to believe in
1930s, not easy in 1950s. By the 1990s his very limited confidence would
have been more justifiable.
Trevelyan said, and no one can disagree, that he was a man of letters: a
writer of history, not a professional research historian.
Walking in the dene at Hallington he made the distinction clear to me in six
words, barked out in his appalling, grating voice: 'Namier - good research
worker - no historian]' Then he broke wind like a blast of trumpets and his
grey eyes and thin mouth displayed the mischievous side of him which
Cannadine does not see or deliberately neglects.
Indeed, for me, Cannadine takes Trevelyan, generous as he was to noble
causes, a little too much at face value. Trevelyan loved to be close to men
of power and loved being tugged reluctantly to the Papal chair.
He preferred winners to losers and gentlemen to academics. And he was
prudish to quite an unnatural degree. His reaction to his brother's
illegitimate child (sired when Sir Charles was nearly 80) was excessive for
a man of letters and even more for an aristocrat. I suspect a considerable
amount of his gloom sprang from emotional, probably sexual difficulties -
his marriage to Janet had, I am sure, grown stale with time for both of
them.
I do not believe that his breakdown as an undergraduate was due to overwork
 -he discharged throughout his life an astonishing amount of work, day in,
day out, year after year. Overwork is an excuse not a cause.
Actually Cannadine is particularly good on the fullness of Trevelyan's
professional life - although he is over kind - Trevelyan was a bad lecturer,
(I could not get pupils to stay with his lectures in the 1930s), just as he
was a thoroughly bad reader either of poetry or even of his own prose - and
he was far too self-secure in these matters to realise his weakness or to do
anything about it.
Deep down in Trevelyan, there was a spring of gloom that fertilised the
beauty of his prose, that haunting tenderness of his for those who were and
are not - as numerous as the sands of the sea and as nameless: somewhere
here he generalises himself to embrace and succour humanity and so moves us
as few other historians have. Trevelyan looms in his books, as he did in
life, a little larger than the rest of us.
And Cannadine should not be too gloomy about his fate. Trevelyan is still
read, still admired - not by historians maybe, but by scientists,
industrialists, economists and civil servants. The culture and the
civilisation of England's past which was Trevelyan's major field of
endeavour, has not been obliterated yet, except perhaps by those who study
it in academe. Buy and read Cannadine's book - give it away at Christmas -
it is an excellent and splendid book but better still, buy Trevelyan's own
works, they are even better.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Books: Beaverbrook: the master of intrigue - The
extraordinary life and times of the great press baron

<TEXT>
BEAVERBROOK: A LIFE by Anne Chisholm and Michael Davie Hutchinson, Pounds
20, 589 pages
POSSIBLY ONE is unduly influenced by the UK's current economic gloom and the
sense of national failure: I found this biography of Lord Beaverbrook almost
unbearably depressing.
Here was a man who arrived in England from Canada in 1910, became a Member
of Parliament before the year was out - even before he was eligible to vote
in a British general election - was knighted in 1911, played some part in
the downfall of Asquith and the formation of the Lloyd George/Bonar Law
coalition, and at the end of 1916 ceased to be Max Aitken and became Lord
Beaverbrook instead.
Some 40 years later he was still intriguing. He became minister of
information in 1918 and was recalled to government in the second world war
as minister of production. Beaverbrook knew practically everyone. He was a
friend - until the Irish Treaty - of Rudyard Kipling, who admired Canada but
disliked the United States. He was close to Arnold Bennett, the writer.
At least three people wrote novels that included him. Evelyn Waugh had him
as Lord Copper in Scoop. Rebecca West, his sometime mistress who described
him as 'every other inch a gentleman' (Beaverbrook was only 5 ft 7 in) had a
go. William Gerhardie, a young protege, thinly disguised him as Lord
Ottercove in his book, Jazz and Jasper.
We should not blame Beaverbrook. He was a brilliant journalist, as
proprietor, writer and innovator. He had been a cub reporter and newspaper
salesboy in his native Canada. He began to acquire the Daily Express in
1910, founded the Sunday Express in 1919 and picked up the Evening Standard
in 1923: thereafter he did not seek to extend his empire.
He was not quite as ruthless as is sometimes suggested. The Daily Express
had only three editors in a period of 40 years. He had a talent for bringing
in writers. The Evening Standard was, as this book points out, his only
paper that was regularly read by his friends. Thus he allowed it be more to
be more sophisticated and less profitable than its stablemates. The
Beaverbrook technique of surprising the readers remains in the Standard even
now: see, for example, an outstanding, unsigned article last Wednesday on
Britain and Europe.
Lord Deedes, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph and also once a Tory
minister, has paid proper tribute. Beaverbrook, he wrote, brought about 'a
social revolution . . . During the 1930s he introduced through his
newspapers a transatlantic philosophy to our still highly class-conscious
and stratified society . . . he did more through his newspapers to
emancipate our society than any of the pre-war political leaders. A cat may
look at a king, he constantly reminded his readers.'
Without the old Express, there might be no Sun today, though Beaverbrook in
the 1930s avoided undue prying into private lives. It is a remarkable
achievement that old models are still being followed by new proprietors.
Nor should we blame Beaverbrook for his string of mistresses who scatter the
pages of this biography. By now they are irrelevant. They took what they
could get, and so did he: he was in many ways a remarkably generous man with
an eye for other people's weaknesses.
The real puzzle is why English society as a whole should have sucked up to
him for so long. The explanation seems to be money. Beaverbrook gave
presents all over the place: he paid other people's debts and seemed to
assume that almost everyone could be bought. The sad truth is that he was
very nearly right: where he erred was in assuming that giving money would
secure political influence. Of the latter, except perhaps in those early
days of the Lloyd George coalition, he had very little.
He must nevertheless have had some personal charm and some insights. The
historian, A J P Taylor, once wrote of him: 'the Empire Crusade was a
knockabout comedy, not worth a footnote in the textbooks. In the 1940 the
minister of aircraft production may have inspired his colleagues; but only
plans made years before could have matured into aircraft,' and much more in
the same scathing tone. Yet within a year Taylor had become a Beaverbrook
admirer and eventually wrote a favourable biography.
The trouble with this laborious work by Anne Chisholm and Michael Davie is
that they seldom stand back and examine why so much much of English society
was so gullible to the Beaverbrook approach. There is also a serious lacuna:
a chapter on how much money Beaverbrook had, and how he managed it, would
have been helpful. For example, he was wise enough to sell a large number of
shares before the great crash of 1929. He was not a Maxwell, but years later
Maxwell had a similar kind of influence.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel Focus - The Caribbean: From Antilles to Zombies - an
A-to-Z - James Henderson, who knows the Caribbean intimately, offers a
comprehensive guide, from plantation houses to X-rated dancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Antilles
The Caribbean islands are made up of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, a
1,700-mile arc of islands running from Florida to the coast of South
America. They vary in size from Cuba (the same size as England) to tiny cays
and sandbars with just a few palm trees. They go by many names: the Antilles
after a mythical medieval continent in the unexplored Atlantic; the West
Indies because Columbus struck west in search of India; and the Caribbean
after the cannibalistic Carib Indians he found there.
Today, the Caribbean offers a superb rest-cure: easy-going island-life and a
warm and welcome relief from the grinding downward spiral of winter
depression. There is dependable sun, sea, sand, rum punch and reggae.
Comfort comes in many forms - private island enclaves, old colonial
refinement, luxury aboard a 100-ft yacht . . .
Anguilla
A slumber-struck retreat with superb beaches, beloved of a well-heeled
British crowd. Quietly chic with some expensive hotels (Cap Juluca, Cove
Castles and Malliouhana, but also some guest houses), and a string of
water-front restaurants.
Antigua
Also favoured by the well-to-do: excellent deserted beaches and some
five-star hotels (Curtain Bluff, Jumby Bay and mock rustic Galley Bay).
Famed for Race Week, out of Nelson's Harbour, at the close of the Caribbean
winter sailing season.
Beaches
The Caribbean has some of the world's finest beaches - blinding white
strands that run deserted to the horizon; talcum-powder sand washed with
gin-clear water; palm-backed posing beaches where the body-beautiful roam;
smuggler's coves.
A pick of the best: Anse la Roche, an isolated cove on Carriacou; Anse de
Grande Saline on St Barts for starlet-spotting; Shoal Bay in Anguilla for
supreme, palm-shaded sand; five miles of Negril Beach in Jamaica for
unflinching hedonism.
Barbados
A grand dame of Caribbean tourism. The west coast, a millionaire's
playground (hotels like Sandy Lane and Cobbler's Cove), has attracted the
smart set for a couple of generations, but it is easy to have a good time on
a less expansive budget.
Bequia
Post-card picturesque, Bequia is the prettiest of the Grenadines. The Port
Elizabeth waterfront is lined with neat wooden villas and small hotels
nestling among the palms.
Carnival
People leave their jobs to get back to Trinidad's Carnival, a five-day
extravaganza of calypso concerts and street parades. Thousands of costumed
masqueraders shuffle-step in choreographed sequence through the streets of
Port of Spain and, unlike Rio and New Orleans - 'just fashion parades,' the
Trinis claim - you can buy a costume and join in. Most other Caribbean
islands have their own carnivals now, and any is worth attending if you are
on-island.
Calypso
Calypsos are the driving beat behind carnival, bounding along to a
drum-driven rhythm. But they are more than simply dance-music; the lyrics
sing of love, sex and politics. And the calypsonians, Lord This and The
Mighty That, are performers as well as singers.
Climate
The Bahamas were once known as the Isles of Perpetual June because Caribbean
weather is so dependably warm. The temperature hovers at about 80`F
year-round. Seasons are dry and wet (June and November).
The best (and most expensive) time to travel is January-April (high season),
when the weather is constant and the tradewinds at their strongest.
Hurricanes are the fiercest natural scourge in an otherwise clement area.
Diving
Scuba-diving in warm tropical waters takes you into a different dimension.
You glide over vast hemispheres of brain coral and barrel sponges big enough
to sit in; shoals of fish dip and dart and crabs eye you quizzically. Famous
dive-sites include: Bonaire slopes for colourful corals; barrier reefs in
the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and the sheer walls of the Cayman
Islands, where you can cavort with sting rays.
Festivals
There are many festivals besides the carnivals: sailing regattas, deep-sea
fishing tournaments, Catholic fetes patronales (Saint's Days, but more like
a week's celebration), even Hindu and Muslim festivities. Others are centred
on music and dance, from imported jazz to home-grown concerts.
French Caribbean
The French Antilles (Martinique, Guadeloupe, St Martin and St Barts) have a
standard of living equal to that of France itself. You may have to put up
with crowds, but these islands have fine classical French restaurants and
bistros.
Getting around
There are plenty of taxis in the Caribbean, but local buses are more fun,
and more like mobile discotheques than transport. Many have names - Street
Demon, Thunder Run - and you will get to know fellow passengers well in the
squash. Hire cars and mini-mokes are readily available, though they vary in
price and regulations across the islands.
Hustlers
Hustling is persistent in some islands (especially Jamaica) and can be
annoying, even frightening. Small-time dealers scour the beaches and towns
and will offer you anything from a rasta wristband to a bag of ganja. A
persistent and polite 'No' is the only way to keep your peace.
Humming-birds
These tiny, shimmering creatures of great beauty have a metabolic rate so
high they must fly and feed all day. Trinidad, which has some of the most
extensive birdlife in the region, has 16 species of hummingbirds alone.
Island hopping
Most of the graceful inter-island schooners are gone now, so island-hopping
is done via coffin-sized aircraft that hum like oversized tuning forks but
can stop on a sixpence. Airstrips (not much larger) can be hair-raising.
Worst of all is Saba in the Dutch Windwards, a 400-yard strip with a 100-ft
drop at either end.
Jamaica
The largest and liveliest of the former British islands. A string of villas
and top-notch hotels can protect you from hustlers, but Jamaica is also an
island to explore for inland bathing in rivers and waterfalls, the
hedonistic pleasures of Negril, and for world-famous reggae bands playing to
small home crowds.
Limbo
Trinidadians must take the credit/responsibility for the limbo, an
impressive athletic feat that is now the scourge of every tropical party.
Dancers perform an inverted high jump, shuffling, sidling and shimmying
under a (sometimes flaming) pole.
Liming
A traditional Caribbean pastime, centred on streetfront rum-shops - a cross
between passing the time of day and street theatre.
Island retreats
There are some supremely luxurious private island retreats in the islands.
In the Grenadines are Petit St Vincent (PSV to its habitues) and Young
Island, once swapped by the governor for his black stallion. In the Virgin
Islands try Peter Island or Richard Branson's Necker Island.
Monte Cristo
It is ironic that the world's finest cigars, so beloved of fat-cat
businessmen, are made in Cuba, the self-appointed adversary of capitalism.
Fidel himself has stopped smoking them, but you will see Cuban builders
puffing on Size 4 Monte Cristos while mixing the cement.
Mustique
An absurdly luxurious, little-island enclave in the Grenadines, peopled by
notables as varied as Princess Margaret and David Bowie.
Netherlands Antilles
The Dutch Caribbean is split into two groups separated by 600 miles of the
Caribbean Sea - the Dutch Windwards (Saba, St Eustatius and over-developed
Sint Maarten) and the Dutch Leewards (Bonaire, Curacao and Aruba), with
colourful facades and curly gables like a tropical Amsterdam. The language,
Papiamento, is an unholy mix of Portuguese, African, English, Spanish and
Dutch.
No problem]
The popular T-shirt slogan and habitual call of West Indians when they are
being so laid back it becomes annoying. If you complain about your meal
taking too long, they will reply coolly 'No Problem', and carry on
regardless.
Oloffson Hotel
A magnificent gingerbread mansion in Port au Prince (Haiti's capital), used
by Graham Greene as the setting for his novel, The Comedians. The man who
inspired the character Petit Pierre still breakfasts each morning on the
veranda.
Plantation houses
While most Caribbean hotels are furnished in white wicker with bright and
breezy pastel fittings, there is the odd hangover from the plantation days.
The tiny, twin-island country of St Kitts and Nevis has half-a-dozen
excellent plantation hotels.
Rhythm
Music is played everywhere in the Caribbean, usually at high volume and all
day long (except when the cricket commentary is on). There is practically a
different beat for each island. The best known is reggae from Jamaica (now
grafted with rap to become dancehall); Trinidad reverberates to soca (from
soul-calypso), and Martinique to the racing double beat of zouk. The Latin
islands have their rhythms, too: the Dominican Republic bustles to meringue
and Cuba and Puerto Rico have their own versions of salsa.
Rum punch
Rum is the Caribbean's drink. The rhyme for rum punch goes: One of sour
(lime-juice), Two of sweet (cane-juice or sugar), Three of strong (rum),
Four of weak (water). Nutmeg is often sprinkled on top (Blackbeard would
drink his rum with a tincture of gunpowder). The locals usually drink white
overproof rums and it is well worth joining them.
Shades and swimsuits
These are the essential wardrobe of the Caribbean traveller, though there
are still one or two places where you can air the tuxedo: the smarter hotels
in Barbados still retain a dress code and many places request a jacket.
Generally, a shirt and trousers or a skirt are enough in the evenings.
Santo Domingo
The oldest city in the New World, capital of the Dominican Republic.
Tradewinds
The Tradewinds are the refreshing equatorial breezes that blow through the
islands, taking the edge off the heat.
Operators
Some of the best-known UK specialists include: Caribbean Connection (tel:
0244-341131), Elegant Resorts (0244-329671) and Caribtours (071-581-3517).
Volcanoes
Here are a couple of predictions for Caribbean volcanic activity in the
1990s: the appearance of one island (probably Kick 'Em Jenny in the
Grenadines, which has been growing steadily over the decades), and the
disappearance of another.
Virgin Islands
A scattering of 100-odd islands and cays, divided between the US and UK. St
Thomas in the USVI is over-developed (into a superannuated shopping
precinct), but eastward is a string of smaller islands with isolated coves
and superb beach bars.
Watersports
From pedalos to parascenders, the Caribbean has them all. Join the rude-boys
on a jet-ski for the afternoon, or tame the winds on a sail-board.
X-rated dancing
Caribbean dancing is all lower-carriage movement, a mesmeric swaying and
pumping of hips and thighs. Typically forthright, Trinidadian dancers lock
themselves together from midriff to mid-thigh as they 'wine and grine' (back
to back, front on back, or just plain groin on groin). In the Latin islands
they waltz with a graceful bustle, sensuality created by thighs that barely
touch.
Yankee dollar
An old calypso sings of working for the Yankee dollar, which is still in
universal demand. Most islands have their own currency, but hotel and often
restaurant prices are set in US dollars. Credit cards are accepted
everywhere on the tourist circuit. Generally, the Caribbean is not cheap
(unless you go native) and you can expect to pay similar prices to home when
eating out.
Yachting
The two main yachting areas are the Virgin Islands, safe and relatively easy
sailing along the Sir Francis Drake Passage, with short hops between beach
bars; and the Grenadines, which have a wilder beauty and less developed
islands. Both have isolated, sandy coves and cays to which you can retreat.
Gin palaces are readily available with direct airport transfer to on-board
heli-pads.
Zombies
The name of the living dead in Haitian voodoo. They are not known to haunt
beach bars and hotels.
An updated edition of James Henderson's Cadogan Guide to the Caribbean, with
revised sections on restaurants, hotels, bars and beach bars, was published
on October 1 (Pounds 12.95).

Mussorgsky: Khovanshchina. Bulat Mingelkiev, Nikolay Okhotnikov, Olga
Borodina, Vladimir Galuzin, Alexey Steblianko etc. / Kirov Chorus and
Orchestra/ Valery Gergiev. Philips 432 147-2 (three CDs)
Tchaikovsky: Queen of Spades. Vladimir Atlantov, Mirella Freni, Maureen
Forrester, Sergey Leiferkus, Dmitry Hvorostovsky etc./ Boston SO, Tanglewood
Festival Chorus/ Seiji Ozawa. RCA Victor 09026 60992 2 (three CDs)
THE LATEST recording of Mussorgsky's last operatic epic launches an
important Philips series of Russian-opera recordings by the great opera
company of St Petersburg. (War and Peace and Queen of Spades will follow).
What exactly to call this great company has been a thorny business for
Philips: a grandiose Kirov logo is blazoned at the top of the box lid, while
lower down the appellations Kirov (name of company) and Maryinsksy (name of
theatre) are both offered.
This question of names Soviet and pre-Soviet is not insignificant - it is a
consequence of the tremendous changes in Russian life and politics (which
the Kirov-Maryinsky confusion betokens) that this formerly inconceivable
link-up between a western record company and a Russian opera-house could
have come about.
In many ways Khovanshchina is an ideal first offering for such a series. A
'musical drama' in six scenes written to catch the temper and the pulse of a
nation at a crucial moment in its history - Peter the Great waiting in the
wings while rebellious nobles and religious fanatics struggle for supremacy
or survival - it seems in this superbly colourful, gripping, and
authoritative Kirov reading a hot-off-the-press artistic vision.
The work is famously problematic: a tangle of mostly unorchestrated sketches
posthumously edited by Rimsky-Korsakov and in our century re-edited by
Shostakovich, it has a narrative surface disjunct, awkward to negotiate and
for non-Russian listeners laden with confusions. Yet by means of apparently
illogical fragments of plot gathered from across the widest spectrum of
Moscow society, there are developed with magnificent grandeur the opera's
themes of power, honour, belief and duty confronted with the winds of
change.
For this reason any Khovanshchina cannot help possessing a degree of
'relevance': in the light of recent Russian history it is an opera that
grows more starkly modern by the minute. It is also an opera that, though
capable of providing opera-house thrills on the largest scale, benefits
considerably from repeated listening. And, indeed, it is admirably
represented on recent recordings - Abbado's 'live' 1990 Vienna set (DG) and
Sony's same-year issue from Sofia (in its 'Russian Opera' series) are both
impressively cast, conducted and argued in editorial terms.
What (to my mind) sets the new Kirov Khovanshchina above both is an
idiomatic vividness in the orchestral and choral sound that is strictly
incomparable. People who fear that the trends of internationalisation facing
the arts and artists of eastern Europe will end by ironing out national
distinctions of style, timbre and attack can take a measure of comfort from
the artistic stance of Valery Gergiev, young Kirov Opera chief and conductor
of the Philips series. He is passionately concerned with re-evaluation but
also with preservation. In contrast to Abbado's reading, obviously more
gracefully nuanced in its phrasing, he offers a gust of urgency that
animates Mussorgsky's plain musical invention into a state of almost
continuous dramatic excitement.
This affects the the entire cast. Vocally, only one of the singers can be
placed in the great Russian line: the mezzo Olga Borodina as the prophetess
Marfa, a voice of youthfully lustrous beauty and a manner at once noble and
intense which sheds on the whole work a special glow. The leading basses
(Okhotnikov as Dosifey, Mingelkiev as Khovansky) and tenors (Steblianko as
the cultivated schemer Galitzin, Galuzin as the dissolute Andrey Khovansky)
are all worthy singers outpointed by one or other of their counterparts on
the rival recordings. The wholeness of the performance, and its majestic
sweep, render such point-making unimportant.
It makes an unfair companion to RCA's new Queen of Spades - a conflation of
'live' recordings taken at Ozawa's concert performances in Boston and New
York last year. The American chorus sounds hard-working, painstaking and
just plain foreign. The conducting, though expert in cultivating glossy
orchestral playing, only intermittently taps the high theatricality of
Tchaikovsky's sounds and harmonies.
The leads, Atlantov and Freni, are two experienced performers here shown
some way below their best form - he forceful but often crudely loud, she
making eloquently lyrical use of a soprano instrument no longer fresh.
First-rate accounts of Tomsky by Leiferkus, Yeletsky by Hvorostovsky and the
old Countess (in spite of melodramatic touches) by the veteran Maureen
Forrester add to the value. But this astonishing opera still awaits a modern
recording that is both locally idiomatic and (as it were) internationally
impassioned. Will Philips and the Kirov combine to produce it?

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOOD RECORDINGS of Spoken Word can transport us, lock, stock and barrel,
into other worlds and other eras. While we listen we are, in a real sense,
spell-bound. Easily top of the latest collection of spell-binders is Edward
Petherbridge's reading of E M Forster's first novel, his tragi-comedy of
1905, Where Angels Fear To Tread (Sterling Audio Books SAB OS2; six
cassettes; five hours; unabridged).
In a luminous performance of the greatest delicacy and intelligence,
Petherbridge realises suburban Sawston, all prickly English respectability,
as well as the dusty and sun-drenched Tuscan hill village of Monteriano,
where a young, well-to-do, silly widow from Sawston is regretting her hasty
marriage to an idle Italian youth. (The gulf between the southern and
northern temperaments pre-figures uncannily the greater chasm discovered in
A Passage To India.) The comedy is dry, the tragedy appalling.
Almost a century later, in Rat Race by Dick Francis, nicely read by Ian
Ogilvy (Word For Word Audio Books WFW 102; four cassettes; six hours;
unabridged), we enter a special world where small-time air-taxi charter
firms touch the world of racing. Taut story-telling, tense action, first
rate listening.
From the same list, Ruth Rendell's whodunnit, Wolf To The Slaughter (WFW
105; six cassettes; six hours; unabridged), a story of sadism and sexual
obsession, is strongly and sympathetically read by Robin Bailey with one of
the most persuasive voices in the business.
John Buchan's Salute To Adventurers (Schiltron Audio Books SPF 090; six
cassettes; eight hours 22 minutes; abridged) published in 1915, is set in
the last years of the 17th century and recounts the adventures of
impoverished young Andrew Garvald from the Lanark moors, sent on business to
far-off Virginia. What landscapes Buchan could record, what action] One of
the most rewarding adventure stories I have listened to for a long time, and
superbly read by the Scottish actor Robert Trotter.
Colin Wilson achieved instant fame at the age of 25 when his study of
alienation, The Outsider, was published in 1956. In The Essential Colin
Wilson, a CD from Nimbus Records (NI 5124; 68 minutes), he lays bare the
heart of his existentialist philosophy. 'The Peak Experience' he celebrates
is instantly recognisable, and he is an optimist. He believes humanity may
evolve to inhabit that world of fulfilment we only catch glimpses of at
present. An expert speaker, and a fascinating listen. It makes you think.
Wilson has also written a provocative introduction to another CD, which the
Medici String Quartet has made to celebrate the inauguration of Kingston
University. Mozart's Journey To Prague (MQCD 6005; 79 minutes; DDD) is a
playlet (written by Wilson himself for the occasion) in which a chance
meeting between Mozart (Richard McCabe) and the Countess of Shinzburg
(Dorothy Tutin) gives an opportunity for much good talk and a master class
on his quartets for 'her' musicians, who give a delightful concert.
There are two other highly entertaining words-and-music recordings from
Nimbus Records, each consisting of two CDs: Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince
with four other stories from the same volume (NI 1797; two hours approx;
music from Vaughan Williams, Granados, Ravel and Shostakovitch), and an
abridged version of Alice In Wonderland (NI 5046/7; two hours approx; music
from Mendelssohn's String Symphonies). The reader in both is the protean Sir
John Gielgud at his exhilarating best. Probably intended for the children,
but will be much enjoyed by their elders.
This season's harvest of short stories includes some real winners. The Dead
And Other Stories (CSA Telltapes TTDMC 415; two cassettes; three hours
approx) is a selection from James Joyce's Dubliners (published in 1914),
read with dIgnity and charm by the Joyce specialist, T P McKenna. Five
lively miniatures lead up to the beautifully observed and subtly developed
longer story, The Dead, about a small Christmas dance and a middle-aged
husband's unexpected access of desire. A darling set.
The Bottom Line And The Sharp Edge (TTDMC 414; two cassettes; three hours
approx) offers seven stories from clever Fay Weldon, who examines her
contemporaries with a cool stare and generally finds more to blame in the
men than in the women. The first story, Man With No Eyes, and the title
story are outstanding; all are strongly read by Julie Christie.
Woman's Hour Short Stories (BBC Radio Collection ZBBC 1335; two cassettes;
two hours 30 minutes) is a collection of 12 attractive 12-minute stories,
some very moving, such as Cora Sandel's There's A War On, some hilarious,
like Rumer Godden's To Uncle With Love, with jewel-bright readings from
Patricia Hodge, Beryl Bainbridge, reading one of her own stories, Kate
Binchy and others, including three men.
Jeffrey Archer's A Quiverful Of Arrows - Vol Two (TTDMC 410; two cassettes;
three hours approx) has six stories, the two longest of which are about
money and all of which have Archer's famous 'twist in the tale'. Expertly
read by Martin Jarvis.
The Vicar Of Nibblewick And Other Stories (Random Century Audiobooks RC 114;
two cassettes; three hours approx) is the first recording of any of the late
Roald Dahl's short stories for grown ups, and the title story (in truth a
rather inflated joke) was written not long before he died. Of the other
five, two are frightening, one is quaint, Mr Botibol is delectable (but did
the author think he had invented the name of Angel Botibol, that respected
London tobacconist?) And Taste, about wine-snobs, is displeasing.
Stephen Fry reads them all with a nicely ironical tone (but with one
mistaken pronunciation which will be picked up by even the least snobby of
claret-fanciers). He also delivers Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Verses (RC
116; two cassettes; three hours approx) with panache and high good humour in
the best performance of them I have heard.
I firmly believe that there is a place for abridged versions of novels and
Random Century Audiobooks produces some good ones. The narrator of Margaret
Atwood's Cat's Eye (RC66; two cassettes; three hours approx; abridged)
claims that 'Time is not a line but a dimension . . . You don't look back
along time but down through it, like water.' She has come back to Toronto
and ineluctably relives the unhappiness her hateful 'best friend', Cordelia,
inflicted on her in childhood. But why isn't Cordelia there now, when she
needs her oldest friend to grow old with? Thanks to Kate Nelligan's reading,
Toronto has us spell-bound.

GLENN GOULD, the most controversial and elusive pianist of the century, died
ten years ago this month, just a few weeks past his 50th birthday. He
continues to attract calumny and extravagant praise in equal measure. There
has been a posthumous collection of his writings (The Glenn Gould Reader,
edited by Tim Page) as well as numerous biographies and appreciations, the
most useful of which is Otto Friedrich's Glenn Gould: A Life and Variations.
But the recordings remain the core of Gould's musical legacy, as they were
always at the very centre of his life.
Now CBS has launched its 'Glenn Gould Edition'. Over the next two years the
company will make available remastered versions of everything the pianist
ever recorded - concerts as well as studio sessions. It is an ambitious,
fascinating project, promising many revelations and opportunities to savour
again unforgettable performances.
Gould's career as a concert pianist lasted little more than a decade; he
gave his last public recital in 1964. Thereafter work in the studio took
pride of place, with radio and television documentaries for Canadian
Broadcasting as well as an enormously wide-range of recording projects.
Tales of his eccentricity prospered until the peerless quality of his piano
playing seemed obscured not only by some of his more questionable
interpretations but also by the mythology surrounding them - his solitary
lifestyle, his refusal to shake hands for fear of damaging his fingers, his
extraordinary crouching style at the keyboard, the constant crooning that
accompanied all his performances.
How exceptional much of that playing was, and how penetrating the
intelligence reinforcing it emerges vividly in the first batch of
re-releases. Of course Gould was a wayward and sometimes downright perverse
genius - as unpredictable in his choice of repertory as in his
interpretations. His range was enormous, from the Elizabethan virginalists
right up to contemporary composers. Yet he ignored the 19th-century
romantics almost entirely, omiting Schubert, Schumann, Chopin and Liszt, and
preferring instead to explore the century's byways - hence his versions of
Bizet's Variations, Grieg's Piano Sonata (heavily indebted, ironically, to
Schumann) and Richard Strauss's early Sonata, coupled here with the rarely
heard and distinctly oddball melodrama with piano, Enoch Arden.
Whatever the diversions, the keyboard music of Bach was the lynchpin of his
repertory. The case for playing it on a modern piano was never put more
convincingly than in Gould's performances of the Goldberg Variations, the
English and French Suites and the 48 Preludes and Fugues. The 1955 version
of the Variations is included here, the record with which he first burst
upon an unsuspecting musical world. It remains a vivid document, daring in
its selection of tempi, rhapsodical in its phrasing, crystalline in its
grasp of structure. As always one can argue with some of the details, the
extremes of tempi, the self-conscious phrasing, but never with the
conviction and certainty with which everything is presented.
Listening again to Gould playing Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven his instinctive
contrapuntalism comes ever sharper into focus; he thought of music as
essentially a linear, multi-layered art, and his style of playing, with its
lean, sharp focused tone and prodigious control of articulation and
phrasing, was suited perfectly to delineating such strands. That might
account for his distaste for the high romantics, in which harmonic colour is
so important expressively , as well as for his fondness among 20th-century
composers for Schoenberg and Hindemith.
The recordings of the Second Viennese School will presumably re-emerge
later, but Hindemith is represented already by a collection of the brass
sonatas accompanied by Gould. It is hardly familiar fare, but Gould focuses
immense concentration on to what would otherwise seem routine
accompaniments, just as he almost succeeds in rescuing a pallid collection
of pieces by his Canadian contemporaries by the sheer force of his
personality. The acuity of the musical mind, as in all the performances on
these discs, is never to be doubted.

IF, LIKE ME, you have only recently come to terms with the compact disc as
your preferred listening format, you will be disheartened to hear that
Philips and Sony are preparing pre-Christmas launches of the DCC (Digital
Compact Cassette) and the MD (mini disc), respectively.
What, you might reasonably ask, should you do with your CD? What has
happened to DAT? And who is to say that DCCs and/or MDs will not go the same
way (nowhere, fast)?
However, jazz music buyers with an interest in these things should note that
PolyGram, which is owned by Philips, will soon release potentially big
selling albums from Stan Getz, Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Henderson in DCC
format, on its Verve jazz label.
Over at EMI, meanwhile, the Blue Note label continues to mine its back
catalogue of lovingly hand-crafted analogue recordings for transfer to CD -
and CD only. This latest series of 'Classic Blue Notes' consists of four
sides of greasy originals and standards on one disc from Hammond organist
Jimmy Smith (Plain Talk and Open House).
Recorded in 1960, subsequently remastered but not released until 1967, the
discs are class all-star sessions. Smith's captivating Hammond sound was
often used as a comfortable, easy moving vehicle for the label's top horns
to relax with and these dates feature trumpeter Blue Mitchell and
saxophonists Ike Quebec (tenor) and Jackie McLean (alto) kicking back into a
wild blue yonder.
The series includes a similarly blue tinged bag of standards from tenorist
Stanley Turrentine with wife Shirley Scott piloting a chintzier Hammond
(Never let me go) and a Seventies soul time capsule from trumpeter Donald
Byrd (Blackbyrd).
The latter is a tremendous period piece whose chunky groove and wah wah
guitar conjure up pictures of cool, Shaft-like dudes in bubble hair-dos and
long leather coats. At opposite ends of the swing spectrum is Art Blakey's
sextet version of the Messengers, Buhaina's Delight and Early Circle, Chick
Corea's abstract quartet (Anthony Braxton, Dave Holland and Barry Altschul)
of 1970 which completes the series.
Two contemporary but very different CDs worth exploring are Paul Grabowsky's
Tee Vee and Spirits Rejoice from the Dedication Orchestra. Australian
composer/pianist Grabowsky is a thoughtful stylist along the lines of Bill
Evans with some good tunes. His tempered playing here is set against the
better established talent of fellow Aussie, tenorist Dale Barlow.
The splendidly overwrought 24-piece Dedication Orchestra is a celebration of
the South African ex-pat Blue Notes, whose wayward improvisation found a
welcome home in London in the Sixties. It is also an effervescing showcase
of the city's most liberated jazz musicians and sure to become a collectors
item for that reason alone.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel Focus - The Caribbean: Ritual bonding for the family
 -Martin Dickson, his wife and three children, go on a Club Med holiday in
the Bahamas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT FIRST dawned on me that I might have come to the wrong place when this
overly jolly and insistent man accosted me on the Club Med restaurant steps.
'Will you cheer for me in the lip-synching contest?' he demanded. At least,
that's what I think he said. I was more intent on avoiding him than catching
his precise words. I swerved out of his way.
'You've frightened him,' he was told by his giggling lady companion, like
him a member of staff at the Club Med resort on the Bahamian island of
Eleuthera. He had, too. At the mere mention of the phrase 'audience
participation,' I tend to break out in a sweat and look anxiously for the
nearest exit. So on Day 1 of a week-long holiday I did not exactly welcome
the idea of relentless, collective jollification.
More fool you, you might say. After all, Club Med, arguably the greatest
French cultural export of the past half century, with outposts scattered
like the Foreign Legion across (mainly) hot and sandy regions of the globe,
is known for little else but relentless, collective jollification.
For sure, the popular image of Club Med's villages has them filled with
clean-limbed, sun-kissed youths who spend the long, laughing tropical days
in vigorous sporting activity, the evenings in hearty social bonding, and
the nights in vigorous sexual bonding. The club's artful slogan hints at all
these delights: 'Club Med, the antidote for civilisation.'
But the dull old world of demographics, together with the profit motive, has
encouraged Club Med to establish a group of villages very different from the
archetype. These are family resorts, catering to the (very civilised)
demands of an ageing baby-boom generation that goes on holiday with its
children and needs them entertained.
Eleuthera is just such a resort, offering a wide range of sporting and other
activities for adults and children, together with an elaborate system of
child-care that can take nasty little brats off their parents' hands from
early in the morning until the middle of the evening, with only a small,
late-afternoon break.
Blissful images of lazy, child-free days filled my head as I booked an
Eleuthera package for myself, wife and three children. I might spend a day
soaking up the silence on the fine, pink-tinged sand of the palm-fringed
beach, then drift through a few days of sailing, snorkelling, water-skiing
and scuba diving. In the evenings, with the children sleeping off the day's
activities, we would linger over meals of fine French cooking.
Inevitably, reality did not entirely live up to this fantasy. Certainly, the
food was very good and there was an extraordinary range of
constantly-changing dishes. Club Med offers almost a dozen kinds of
freshly-baked bread alone. The accommodation was a little spartan, but clean
and quite sufficient for a holiday spent almost entirely out of doors.
The kids' programme was certainly full, and among many other things gave our
children the chance to water ski, go for sailing trips, scuba dive, snorkel,
play soccer, golf and tennis, swim, find treasure and even become trapeze
artists, thanks to the resort's own mini-circus.
There were, however, two significant drawbacks. First, so many activities
were crammed into the programme, and so many children were doing each one,
that there was no time for a child to concentrate on getting one thing right
 -and no opportunity to take private lessons outside the strict timetable.
Take scuba diving. A couple of dozen children would spend half-an-hour or
more hanging around the village swimming pool waiting for a mere one-minute
swim with a scuba kit, followed by a pose in full gear for a photographer -
a case of 'never mind real expertise, here's a pic to impress the folks back
home.'
Second, programmes like this are only as good as the camp instructors
leading them and the size of the classes. Our eldest child, aged nine, and
youngest, five, had good, enthusiastic minders and thoroughly enjoyed
themselves. But our normally uncomplaining seven-year-old suffered from
being in a large group led by young people whom we felt lacked sensitivity
towards their charges. She was so unhappy that she spent much of the week
moping around us. Goodbye peace and quiet. Goodbye sailing. Goodbye our
reason for being in Club Med.
Nor were the evenings entirely child-free. The club did entertain children
while their parents ate an earlyish meal, and that was a boon. But far from
collapsing into bed thereafter, virtually all the children in the village
then converged on the club's open-air auditorium for a show which lasted
until 10.30. By the end of the week, ours were distinctly ratty.
It is one of Club Med's great traditions that there is a show in each
village every night. They can be of a surprisingly reasonable standard and
while they are put on by the phenomenally hard-working staff, some involve
the guests, both children and adults.
Each evening also ends with a ritual bonding activity - the collective
singing of a silly pop song, accompanied by a choreography of absurd hand,
arm, head and leg movements. Children love it, but it is not the kind of
thing that comes easily to your average up-tight Englishman.
For large parts of the day you can get away from such jollity, though it
still tends to pop up unexpectedly. 'Before you can get on the boat, you
must all say 'Hello, Captain Tom',' insisted the group leader on one
snorkelling trip. We all said it - through gritted teeth.
Still, there is something infectious about the Club Med atmosphere. Despite
our reservations about the children's programme, we met many American
families who swear by it and go back year after year to Eleuthera or the
company's other Caribbean family resorts.
And while these days it may not be an antidote to civilisation, it does
break down inhibitions. Just ask the prominent American lawyer in our
village who cavorted across the stage in one show clad in little more than
his underpants. By the end of the week even I was twitching discreetly to
the silly song.
Club Med is still expanding. On November 6 it opens its first village in
Australia, on Lindeman Island, in the Whitsunday and Cumberland island group
just off the Queensland coast and two boat-hours west of the Great Barrier
Reef. Accommodation for 550 guests is in three-storey, air-conditioned
lodges. Club Med took control of the island in May 1991 and has spent Pounds
21m on refurbishing the resort. An inclusive week's stay (without flights)
starts at Pounds 694 per adult and Pounds 347 per child (4-11 years of age).
Flights to Australia from the UK can be arranged by Club Med from Pounds
750, as can stop-overs in Cairns and Sydney.
Details of the Eleuthera resort and many others can be found in Club Med's
Winter Sun '92-'93 brochure. It also has a skiing brochure. In London, Club
Med is at 106-110 Brompton Rd, SW3 1JJ. Tel: 071-581-1161, fax:

FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel Focus - The Caribbean: Vieques: an odd experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is odd that the finest beaches in Puerto Rico are almost undeveloped,
when a quick look at Miami Beach or the San Juan water-front shows that
Americans are hardly shy of building on a good strip of Caribbean sand. And
yet Vieques, a little-known island off Puerto Rico with some superb beaches,
has no skyscraper hotels, no casinos and no Vegas-style entertainment.
Instead, Vieques has just a few small guest houses with personable if
eccentric managers. The locals spend most of their time playing dominoes and
'liming' (see A-to-Z). And, as well as deserted beaches, Vieques is the site
of one of the Caribbean's most extraordinary natural phenomena - a
phosphorescent lake.
The reason for Vieques' lack of development is that it is mostly owned by
the US Navy, which uses it as an ammunition dump and bombing range. In the
second world war, Vieques was a fall-back harbour for the Royal Navy in case
Britain was captured by the Germans. More recently, the mock invasions of
Grenada were staged there and there was a lot of activity during the Gulf
War.
The navy is an ambivalent presence for the islanders. The nearby islet of
Culebra was in the same position until a few years ago when the inhabitants
started to organise picnics on the bombing range and the navy withdrew. But
for visitors, Vieques is pleasantly undeveloped and peaceful (except for a
couple of weeks a year when they are bombing).
Nothing could be less military-like than the Casa del Frances, a guest house
near Esperanza on Vieques' south coast. It is set in a classic West Indian
estate house, wrapped with huge black-and-white chequered verandas, and has
fan-cooled rooms set around a courtyard.
Poking out of the rampant greenery in the courtyard, metal sculptures strike
irregular, satirical poses. The same might be said for the owner, a
white-whiskered roustabout by the name of Irving Greenblatt, who is
something of a latterday Hemingway. He runs the guest house, which has been
called an 'anti-hotel', with co-manager Frank Celeste, a self-appointed
sexual chronicler (his latest best-seller: A Cookbook, Sex Manual and
History of the Casa).
If you can take the ribbing about the British and their food and about their
being passionless, then it is an amusing place to stay.
If Casa del Frances sounds too rum, you might try the Parador Villa
Esperanza, a more traditional hotel on the beachfront. This is the best
place from which to arrange a trip to the phosphorescent lake in Mosquito
Bay.
Visiting the lake is one of the oddest experiences of a lifetime. It is as
eerie as it is unlikely: water that glows at the touch, glittering as it
slips through your fingers.
A motor boat carves an impressive trail in the water, but it is best to go
by canoe, preferably on a pitch-black night. As you advance, the wake of the
canoe begins to glow and each stroke of the paddle sets off a twirling
vortex of green light. Startled fish dart away as you approach, tracing
green streaks beneath you.
The effect is created by dino-flagellytes - tiny, single-celled protozoa
with a plant-like metabolism. When agitated, they undergo a chemical
reaction and emit a pinprick of light. Cupped in your hands, they look like
distant stars, but if you splash, the overall impression is startlingly
bright.
Dive and swim and you will leave a trail for 10ft behind you; flick your
paddle on the water's surface and you create an arc of light like a
waterfall 20ft across.
Vieques offers laid-back island life Latin-Caribbean style, and feels remote
even though it is just a hop from San Juan (Puerto Rico) and the Virgin
Islands.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Sport: Amateur? Pull the other one, chaps - Rugby Union /
How the code has discovered market forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO YOU thought rugby union was an amateur game? You thought it was the game
that was played for love and that those who wanted to play for money went
north, to play rugby league.
It was - once. But it is not any longer. The world has been stood on its
head. Rugby has gone from being a game of no money to a game of big money.
There is more money in the best rugby union clubs in England and Wales than
in the worst professional rugby league clubs.
For example, Gloucester handed over their commercial affairs to businessman
Mike Burton, a former England player, and in one season earned themselves
Pounds 140,000. Harlequins, the acme of rugby union clubs, signed a Pounds
350,000 four-year sponsorship deal with Flowers Bitter. A Heineken league
game between Swansea and Llanelli last month was almost certainly the first
club match in Britain to generate a turnover of Pounds 100,000.
For Llanelli, traditionally one of the richest clubs in British rugby, this
was the gilt on the gingerbread. This bonanza game came a week after the
club banked Pounds 18,000 for retaining the Welsh Cup last season. It came
within a month of the club receiving Pounds 10,000 for taking part in the
Heineken League and extending its sponsorship deal with Crown Buckley, the
brewers, for another three years for Pounds 150,000.
Such success among the leading clubs in the game is highlighted by the odd
exception. Bath, winners of the Courage League and Pilkington Cup last
season, nevertheless managed to lose Pounds 5,000. At Moseley's annual
meeting members were told the club was Pounds 120,000 in debt. Such
exceptions highlight the general situation, however.
With so much money sloshing around, it is no surprise that some of it is
making its way back to the players in one form or another. Here are some of
the things that have been said about money in rugby union these past 18
months:
A little over one year ago the coach of a leading London rugby club told the
following story. One of his most promising young forwards had come to him in
a state of some agitation having been offered Pounds 20,000 to move to a
particular club. What should he do?
The coach did not want to lose this player, whom he had coached since the
youngster had joined the club as a junior but the club had no money to pay
players. 'Go if you really want to' said the coach. 'Go with my blessing.'
Each member of England's World Cup squad expects to receive between Pounds
5,000 and Pounds 10,000 from their Run with the Ball campaign, launched
during the build-up to the World Cup and officially approved by the
International Board.
Danie Serfontein, the president of the Rugby Football Union, alleged that
some players had been offered Pounds 5,000 to switch clubs.
David Campese, the Australian winger, said he was rugby's first millionaire.
The Australian, allegedly earning Dollars 250,000 annually for appearing for
Milan, later said he was half joking. It is thought he was not joking at
all.
A leading player was being wooed by rugby league. Three businessmen got
together and by guaranteeing him Pounds 50,000 annually ensured he remained
in rugby union.
In South Africa, captaincy of one province is said to carry a salary of the
equivalent of Pounds 25,000.
'I know of a handful of players in the Scottish game who are paid for
playing,' wrote David Sole, the former Scottish captain, in his
autobiography . . . even small clubs in Wales are said to be paying players
Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 for each game. Sole alleges that one Welsh
international switched clubs because his pay was increased from Pounds 200
to Pounds 300.
It has become accepted practice for leading players to move from one club to
another. One forward approached two clubs, offered his services and asked
for a car in return. He was turned down by both. 'I now realise the best
players think the clubs have become benevolent societies for out of work
players' said David Watkins, team manager of Newport.
Some leading clubs are able to offer players a car, job and accommodation
and in very rare cases, all three.
A question: Is this money bad for the game? It has certainly changed the
face of it at the highest level. Rugby is fiercer. There is a real edge to
League games. The start of Northampton's match against Bristol in division
one of the Courage Leagues was as fierce as any game I have ever seen.
I dislike the abuse of the spirit of the laws, if not the laws themselves,
in rugby these days. Last Wednesday night during the game at Cardiff between
a Welsh XV and Italy, physios were on the pitch attending to injuries the
moment a player went down. Once upon a time, a trainer had to be invited on
by the referee.
By the same token, there is no adherence to the understanding that the
referee controls who is on the field. At one point while Wales were kicking
at goal two of the team's attendants were on the field handing out drinks.
And another thing. The replacement law is being used as a substitution law
in some countries. There is no observance of the spirit of the law which is
that a player can only be replaced if he is too injured to carry on.
So if everything else is changing, what is wrong with the arrival in the
game of large sums of money? Here is one way to control it. Name one home
game as belonging to the players in the way that footballers and cricketers
are granted testimonials and benefit matches and let them take the entire
gate, the money to be held in trust until they retire.
Rugby is played by thousands of clubs and market forces will determine which
gets the money and which does not. I suspect that in a few years the game
will comprise those clubs with money and the rest - and the rest will be the
majority. Is that such a bad thing?

<TEXT>
WHEN England start their World Cup campaign against Norway at Wembley on
Wednesday, it will be a testing meeting not just for the team but also for
the resourceful journalists of Britain's tabloid newspapers. After England
lost to the hosts in the European championships in June, one of the tabloids
screamed: 'Swedes 2, Turnips 1'. In September, when England lost in
Santander, it stuck with the theme: 'Spanish 1, Onions 0.'
'I'm beginning to wonder what's the bloody vegetable in Norway,' said Graham
Taylor, the England manager.
Taylor's persecutors have superimposed a photograph of his face on to a
turnip. It is a good joke, but it also contains a truth. On the evidence of
some of Taylor's team selections, criticism from the newspapers seem to have
turned his brain into mashed root vegetable. The irony is that one of the
reasons he was picked for the job over better candidates was his ability to
handle the press.
His two years as England manager have followed the pattern set by his
predecessor, Bobby Robson. England qualified for the European championship
finals in Sweden and then bowed out tamely, as Robson's team did in Germany
four years earlier. Robson also guided England to two World Cup finals.
In both, England started poorly but recovered when the players convinced
Robson to change tactics. Taylor, like Robson, can build a team to qualify
for international tournaments, but picking a team to win them is beyond him.
Americans divide coaches into winners and losers. This is ruthless and
simplistic, but it avoids confusion over priorities. If you want to win
trophies then you pick a coach who has won most competitions at the highest
level. But the choice of Taylor to guide the England team to the World Cup
finals in the US in 1994 suggested that the FA had other goals in mind.
There was a time when even the limited goal of reaching the World Cup finals
seemed beyond England. The team finished the 1960s as world champions. In
the 1970 World Cup, they were cruising to a quarter-final victory over the
West Germans when Germany rallied to win 3-2. By the time England returned
to the World Cup finals in 1982, the assured confidence of that team seemed
an impossible memory.
After England were eliminated in 1973, the FA appointed the 'winningest'
manager in England: Don Revie. From the Revie fiasco, the FA learnt two
wrong lessons. First, that managerial success at club level bears no
relation to success in internationals; second, that an international manager
must, above all, be able to cope with the unremitting attention of the
media.
When the FA appointed a permanent successor they turned to Ron Greenwood -
the perfect man to clear up the wreckage. Over the next two decades, more
difficult men such as Brian Clough, Bob Paisley and Howard Kendall led big
clubs to multiple League championship and European trophies. All were passed
over in favour of others who had achieved respectability and, in the case of
Greenwood and Robson, some cup success, at smaller clubs. Their
appointments, and that of Taylor, were a sign that the FA saw England as a
middle-of-the-table club.
Greenwood and Robson built teams that avoided disaster in the World Cup.
Even so, criticism began to mount. Time and again England have entered
important matches against medium-strength opposition, as they do against
Norway, with the fans and the press predicting the worst. But if England win
narrowly against Norway the personal abuse aimed at Taylor will be
redoubled. English fans may live in constant dread of humiliating defeat,
but they also dream of their team humiliating the world.
Taylor must know by now that, for all his public relations skills, merely
reaching the World Cup finals will not be enough. He must at least match the
Paul Gascoigne-inspired run to the semi-finals in 1990.
Taylor complains frequently, and with some justification, about the problems
he has picking a settled team. But he often fails to take the opportunities
he has. It is difficult to believe that he is nurturing players (other than
David Batty) or developing continuity. The substitutions at the end of the
Spanish defeat created only a sense of chaos.
Taylor knew before the European championships that Gary Lineker would be
quitting international football. But he left out of his squad the two best
candidates to replace him: Ian Wright and David Hirst. As Lineker said, Alan
Shearer is not, for all his virtues, an instinctive goal scorer.
Taylor's squad was devoid of creative players in part because he spurned two
proven internationals: Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley. Both are playing
well this season but neither is in the squad for the game against Norway.
Taylor's reluctance to play Wright, Beardsley or Waddle reveals a lot about
his attitudes. Beardsley lacks stamina, but Taylor has substitutes. Waddle
will not stay in one position: as soon as he steps on the pitch he is out of
the manager's control.
Wright has a reputation for indiscipline. But his electric pace, assured
first touch and goal-scoring instinct make him a potential threat at
international level. Taylor might cave in to pressure and play Wright on
Wednesday but he represents a risk and Taylor is averse to risks.
Taylor must now wrestle with the biggest risk of all: Gascoigne. Taylor does
not trust Gascoigne. He showed that when he dropped him for what promised to
be a robust match against the Republic of Ireland in 1991. Gascoigne's
injury gives Taylor an excuse for leaving him on the substitutes' bench.
This is pragmatism, says Taylor. In truth he is lowering his sights. His
instinct is to pick a team to scuff for a result. But football is full of
scuffers. The true pragmatists know that this is not enough. They are the
ones who collect the trophies Taylor has never won. He is happy to settle
for a diet turnip when he could roll the dice and dine on caviar.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Sport: Vested interests who sustain the big lie over prize
money - Racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the biggest lies in sport is the one that claims that prize money
levels in British horse racing are too low to guarantee the sport's
long-term viability or to offer racehorse owners a fair return on their
investment.
The truth is more prosaic: prize money in British racing is smaller than
some people would like it to be. But that is a mouthful, and not very sexy,
so you almost never hear it.
Instead, the lie itself - that the future of UK racing is being jeopardised
by insufficient prize money - is shouted from the rooftops by those with the
greatest vested interest in perpetuating the whopper: racehorse owners,
breeders and trainers, mainly, plus the hacks of the racing media who fawn
on them like spaniels.
The lie always sounds best in a recession, when the ability of owners to
resist pressures to cut back their racing interests - or quit - is weakest.
The latest muttering and fuss-making was caused by reports that the Maktoum
family of Dubai, which dominates British racing, may consider reducing the
number of racehorses it has in training in Britain (approximately 800), and
sending some to be trained and raced in the US, France and Germany.
The Maktoums would be doing this, the doomsters claim, to boost their
racetrack earnings and thumb a nose at the UK government, which taxes
betting turnover heavily and charges a far higher value added tax on
bloodstock sales than France or Ireland, for example.
Because their racing interests are huge, it would be a wonder if the
Maktoums did not, periodically, assess the size and shape of their racing
empire, and reallocate horses accordingly. But the claim that low prize
money is endangering the sport's future in Britain is risible and dishonest.
For a start, racing is a fully international business. It has been so for
decades. To listen to the whingers and special pleaders, you would think
that UK racehorse owners were restricted, by decree, to running their horses
in Britain, where prize money is less generous than elsewhere. In reality,
owners are free to send their horses on lucrative raids to mop up foreign
prize money - and they do so, with a vengeance.
The reason that most UK owners have most of their horses stabled and trained
in Britain is so they can visit them in the training yards and watch them on
British tracks. But horses that are good enough can range far and wide. They
have their own passports. They jet to Europe, or America - sometimes Japan.
Having grabbed a foreign prize, their owners jet them back again - back to
their British yards, to weary, run-down Britain.
Take last weekend. In Paris last Sunday the British-bred, British-owned,
British-trained star filly, User Friendly - a multiple classic winner -
finished second, beaten a neck, in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Europe's
greatest race, and earned Pounds 205,550 in French prize money to add to her
career haul (six races: unbeaten) of Pounds 523,905.
But User Friendly was not the only UK raider at Longchamps last weekend.
Last Saturday, UK-trained horses finished third and fourth in the Prix de
Royallieu, second and fourth in the Prix du Cadran (won, as it happens, by
Lord Weinstock's French-trained Sought Out), first and second in the Grand
Criterium, third and fourth in the Prix Dollar and third in the Prix de
Lutece.
Last Sunday, in addition to User Friendly in the Arc, UK raiders finished
second, third and fourth in the Prix du Rond-Point, third in the Prix Marcel
Boussac, first, second and third in the Prix de l'Abbaye, and third in the
Prix de l'Opera.
How much prize money did these 18 horses collect for two wins, five seconds,
seven thirds and four fourths in 48 hours at Longchamps last weekend?
Answer: Pounds 595,477 in crispy French francs. Nor was that all. A
UK-trained horse won in Florence last Sunday and another won in Milan. The
day before, Perpendicular, owned by Lord Howard de Walden and trained at
Newmarket by Henry Cecil, won a Pounds 98,246 race at Hoppegarten, Germany,
while the UK-trained Sheikh Albadou was second in the Vosburgh Stakes at
Belmont Park, New York.
In short, UK-based horses are capable of winning sackfuls of foreign prize
money, most of which is repatriated to Britain where owners are free to
recycle it in any way they choose - more racehorses, possibly.
To claim that British racing is in jeopardy on the grounds that prize money
is relatively stingy when averaged out among thousands of runners is
simplistic nonsense. What has to be acknowledged as part of the equation is
UK owners' ease of access to foreign prizes; their considerable success on
foreign tracks, and the prestige and enjoyment they derive from owning
horses in the first place.
All owners are rich, by definition, and most like a gamble. Sometimes these
pay off. Yet the rewards of racing are usually reported in isolation, on the
sports page, the day after a big race. Seldom are they incorporated into
subsequent media discussion of prize money levels or acknowledged by the
numerous pressure groups that make racing Britain's most squabble-driven
sport.
What owners fantasise about is buying or breeding a horse of the supreme
quality of User Friendly - and sometimes they succeed. User Friendly's prize
money total is now Pounds 729,455. Moreover, she stays in training next
year, when her winnings could soar well past Pounds 1m.
Her training costs to date - ball-park figure - are probably a little over
Pounds 15,000 (she was not raced as a two-year-old), plus big-race entry
fees. Net earnings to date, therefore: approaching Pounds 700,000. She was
sired by an English Derby winner, Slip Anchor, so she cost her
owner-breeder, Bill Gredley, a goodly sum to produce. Yet her capital value,
this weekend, far exceeds her production cost, and cannot be far short of
Pounds 1.25m.
With potential rewards of that magnitude, you would think owners would be
more circumspect in their constant pleading for far higher UK prize money.
In that you would be wrong. Many of them beg shamelessly - especially the
aristocrats.
In recent times, UK prize money has see-sawed, because of the recession. But
now it is rising again. In July 1991, the Horserace Betting Levy Board,
which levies bookmakers' turnover and allocates funds for the benefit of
racing, said that its prize money contribution in 1992 would total Pounds
17.5m, a fall of Pounds 5.6m on the revised 1991 allocation. However, four
months ago, because of changed circumstances, the board said its 1992
allocation would be raised by Pounds 1.7m, to Pounds 19.2m, and that its
1993 contribution would be boosted to Pounds 25m.
For sure, UK prize money levels are poor when contrasted with those of other
leading racing countries. Arguably, the UK government still creams off a
disproportionately large slice of betting turnover in tax. Arguably, too
much money is siphoned out of racing by bookmakers, whose leech-like
tenacity and greed have cost the sport amazingly dear.
But at least UK racing is more professionally run that it used to be. And
there is no evidence that it won't survive the recession in reasonable
shape, just as it always has. The Maktoums may move a few horses hither and
yon. But the tears being shed on their behalf are crocodile's.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Cambodia's fields of pity: John Westbrooke tries to make
sense of a country's tragic past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING looks special about the killing fields of Choeung Ek. They are just
fields, in the countryside some 10 miles outside Phnom Penh, Cambodia's
capital. But one day in 1980 a cow's hoof sank into the soil and,
investigating, its owner found human bones.
There are many such cemeteries round the country, the legacy of the
murderous Khmer Rouge regime which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978. At
Choeung Ek, 9,000 skeletons were exhumed from a series of shallow mass
graves, each some 10ft across.
You can walk round inside the slender tower put up as a memorial. On shelves
in the middle are 8,000 skulls, labelled according to sex and age ('Juvenile
female Kampuchean, from 15 to 20 years'). They might be centuries old, but
they are not: had they lived, many would have been younger than me.
I asked Mr Sann, my guide - a former English teacher who trained in
Singapore - if any had been identified. Only the Europeans, he giggled (Sann
giggled a lot); eight or nine of these had been named and returned to their
families. But he pointed to a collection of disinterred rags under the
bottom shelf: 'Last year, a lady found some shorts here. Her husband's'
Outside, a notice board mourns the dead in words which are, somehow, the
more disturbing for their fractured English: 'We seem to be looking at the
horrifying scenes and the panic-stricken faces of the people who were dying
of starvation, forced labour or torture without mercy upon the skinny body,
they died without giving the last words to their kith and kin.'
To save bullets, many were just hit on the head with hoes while tractor
engines were revved-up to drown the screams. Guards are posted around the
monument; Sann said they were scared to go near it after dark.
In the circumstances, perhaps there should be an eerie stillness around the
memorial. But that is not so. There is a school nearby and you can hear the
children laughing and playing; little girls in white blouses and navy skirts
waved as we drove by.
Down the bumpy roads are stalls selling beer, cigarettes and petrol in soft
drink bottles. Ordinary little houses, on stilts, have porches decorated
with pictures - mostly of the Buddha, but I spotted one of a young lady in a
transparent nightdress.
So, I was little wiser as to how Cambodians felt about the years of terror.
The story is appalling. The Khmer Rouge rebels led by Pol Pot were welcomed
as liberators after overthrowing the corrupt Lon Nol regime (Phnom Penh fell
just before Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war); but, working to a plan to
turn all of Cambodia into a sort of collective farm, they proclaimed 1975
Year Zero, renamed the country Kampuchea, and drove everyone into the
countryside to work in the fields.
Anyone suspected of being a saboteur, or an agent of the hated Vietnamese,
or of anyone else, was likely to be tortured and killed. This included any
intellectuals - anyone, for instance, who spoke a foreign language; even
anyone who wore glasses.
So, how did bespectacled, English-speaking Sann survive? He giggled. 'My
students protected me. Many of them joined the Khmer Rouge. They remembered
me and protected me and my wife and family. (Giggle). I had to work in the
country on a farm. My wife was on another farm but I was allowed to see her
every month. My mother and my father and my sister were killed. (Giggle).
But my students protected me.'
Why was he giggling? It seemed impertinent even to wonder.
The Khmer Rouge laid claim to an area of South Vietnam and, after a series
of border clashes, the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia. Within days, the Khmer
Rouge had fled. (Pol Pot now lives in Thailand; the Thais, like the US, seem
not to mind, on the ground that any enemy of Vietnam is a friend of theirs.
Some of his former associates are still in power).
Returning Cambodians found Phnom Penh a ghost town used as a storehouse.
Houses in one street were used for keeping left shoes; right shoes were in
another street across town. Its population, swollen by refugees to 3m in
1975, is still less than a third of that; of the country's 7m people, about
1m had died.
One of the things the Vietnamese discovered was Tuol Sleng, a school in
Phnom Penh used as an interrogation centre. Now, it is a museum; as with the
killing fields, the Cambodians want everyone to see it.
Notices list the Security Regulations: 'Don't try to hide the facts by
making protests this and that. You are strictly prohibited to contest me . .
. While getting lashes or electrification, you must not cry at all . . . If
you disobey any point of my regulations, you shall get either 10 lashes or
five shocks of electric discharge.'
Several rooms had fresh corpses in them when the Vietnamese arrived; they
buried the bodies but the rooms are otherwise as they were found,
bloodstains and all.
Most unsettling, though, is the display of victims. The meticulous
interrogators photographed them all as they arrived; and the photos, row on
row, hundreds on hundreds, line the walls of the old schoolrooms. Almost
all, 17,000 of them, were tortured until they confessed; then they were sent
to Choeung Ek.
Confessed to what? What did the Khmer Rouge want of them? You can see, by
stretching the imagination, why it might (for instance) have suited Hitler
to demonise the Jews; but what sense can the mass slaughter of Cambodians by
Cambodians have made? Can you even call it genocide when they were killing
their own race?
Not all of the victims died: half a dozen escaped alive from Tuol Sleng when
the Vietnamese came. One of them is still there - showing tourists around.
What are you doing here? I wanted to ask him. Why haven't you fled to the
ends of the earth to get away from this place? But then I remembered Sann's
unfathomable giggles and realised that, whatever this man might answer, I
would never understand it; so I did not ask.
Sann was reunited with his family and adopted two orphaned children. Now, he
works for the government, like many Cambodians, but his wages (only about
Dollars 5 a month, anyway) had not been paid for months. He supplements his
income by guiding tourists, dubbing films into Khmer, and occasional
teaching.
The Vietnamese have gone home; the UN is trying to run the country (sending
in troops to scour it for unexploded mines); and businesses such as hotels
are being sold abroad for the hard currency. Cambodia is in a mess.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Tebbit: plain in Spain: Press Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETIMES, I think it is a shame that British disputes are not conducted in
Spanish. The Conservative conference's debate about Europe on Tuesday was
exciting enough in English, but even Lord Tebbit gained in translation.
In the pages of El Pais, he called on the prime minister, John Major, to
raise 'la bandera de todos los patriotas de Europa.' No longer was he the
'Chingford Skinhead' but, perhaps, a fashionable 1968 Latin American
terrorist on a lecture tour, or a peculiarly fanatical supporter of General
Franco circa 1937.
By comparison, the French was a trifle desiccated: Tebbit in Le Figaro
demanded, 'd'abord une politique pour la Grande Bretagne, en suite une
politique pour la Grande Bretagne et enfin une . . .' etc.
The Italian version was inevitably opera: The foreign secretary, Douglas
Hurd, delivered the aria 'Reject this folly' (Respingete questa follia) in
Il Sole: 24 Ore. The paper's London correspondent, Alessandro Merli enjoyed
the Tebbit's speech and the reaction: 'Behind his shoulders, from a podium
that seemed to have been designed for the Soviet politburo in the good old
days, Major and his colleagues observed him in silence with the same
impassivity, and the same complexion, as the late Brezhnev.'
For the Germans, of course, a day late as always, it was the textual
analysis which counted. When the noble lord turned to John Major he was,
according to Bernhard Heimrich in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, even
more deadly than in the 'German' section of his speech. ''You need our
support, Sir, we give it to you.' The cold hostile word, the insult in this
sentence is the tiny word 'Sir.' It says more than a 1,000 words.'
Heimrich noted that the former minister Kenneth Baker had defected to the
'No-to-Maastricht' camp and would vote against the Treaty in spite of party
obligations. He was 'true to the motto of another great European, Martin
Luther: 'I can do nothing else.'' Baker said that in German, and it sounded
indeed like true Luther-German.'
That is probably the last thing the more paranoid Tories want to hear, firm
in their belief that it was 1940 all over again. But Britain does not stand
alone this time round. An interesting 'war of words,' as Major would say,
has broken out between the Italian tycoon Carlo De Benedetti and the editor
of Der Spiegel, Rudolf Augstein.
Writing in his magazine, L'Espresso two weeks ago, Sig De Benedetti said,
'The Italians, the English, the Spaniards and all the others . . .cannot pay
for the containment of east German unemployment by increases in their own
unemployment . . .' In other words, the rest of us should stop having to pay
for German reunification. The article was headed 'Die for Dresden? No.'
Herr Augstein seemed to miss the point when he replied, 'Italy should rather
think of the Mezzogiorno . . . Why a double standard? Should we rebel
against the bad economic management of southern Italy?' Die Welt joined in
saying the 'supermark' could not be blamed for Italy's troubles and its Rome
correspondent complained about the rising tide of 'Germanophobia' in Italy.
Finally, what should have been a footnote last week but I came across it
only an hour before the deadest of deadlines and hardly knew what to make of
it and the odd frisson it created. First a few words of introduction for
those who have forgotten their school history.
In 1870, Kaiser Wilhelm met the French ambassador in the little town of Ems
near Koblenz. The outcome of that meeting was related in a telegram, which
Bismarck then edited for publication in France where it aroused great anger.
Years later Bismarck said it was all part of his successful plan to start
the Franco-Prussian war.
So it was that the Borsen-Zeitung wrote: 'The publication of the views of
Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger on the pound crisis in British
papers reminds us of the vaguely understood 'Ems Telegram' from our history
books.'
So here is the awful coincidence. An Ems Telegram in 1870; an EMS Telegram
in 1992. It is, perhaps, fortunate that the pun does not work in German.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Columbus - the flawed legacy: Five hundred years on, Stephen
Fidler assesses the impact of the famed explorer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE HUNDRED years after his fateful voyage to the new world changed the
shape of history, Christopher Columbus is still stirring things up. To some,
he is the daring and far-sighted navigator of legend who brought
civilisation and the Christian religion to a new world; to others, a greedy
and small-minded opportunist whose actions wreaked devastation on a
continent.
There is no agreement even on what he looked like. None of the thousands of
likenesses being produced for the coming week's celebrations of the 500th
anniversary of his first landfall in the Americas was produced in his
lifetime. Authorities cannot even agree about where he first set foot on
land.
The Columbus story is permeated by myth. The traditional image, as the
fearless explorer, was espoused by the north Americans who 100 years ago
celebrated the anniversary of his 'discovery.' At this time, the US thought
of itself unequivocally as a European society, and European self-confidence
was at its height.
From the other side, the view of Columbus as a greedy fortune-hunter often
is accompanied by the idea of pre-Columbian America as an idyllic state. In
fact, it was subject to periodic and violent upheavals, with cannibalism and
human sacrifice an important part of some societies.
The politically correct also condemn Columbus based on a set of values of
which he could not have known.
It is undeniable, however, that the term 'discovery' for Columbus's voyage
is loaded with Eurocentricity. The 57m people living in the Americas - this
is one serious estimate, but the numbers could have been much higher or
lower - were there long before Columbus tipped up. As one observer has
pointed out, it was rather like President Nixon's 'secret' bombing of
Cambodia: to a lot of Cambodians, it wasn't much of secret.
Authoritative accounts suggest Columbus was not a wonderful navigator. He
appears to have believed throughout his life that he had discovered a new
route to Asia, and his trip arose out of a miscalculation about how far it
was to Japan. It is hard to question his bravery, but his navigational feat
was modest. His second voyage in 1493 took a mere three weeks: he took the
prevailing east winds over and the westerlies back. Once you knew it was
there, it was easy.
If Columbus had not sailed, the Indian 'idyll' would undoubtedly have been
destroyed by other Spanish adventurers soon after. The Spanish monarchy was
in a desperate search for capital: after centuries of fighting, the Arabs
were expelled from the Iberian peninsula in 1492.
During the same year, Jews who refused to convert to Christianity were
ordered out. Not surprisingly, they took their money with them. Although
Columbus had touted his idea to other royal courts, only at the Spanish was
he able to make an impact.
The impact of this was to be devastating: some estimates suggest the native
population of Latin America was reduced by 90 per cent within a century.
Although the indigenous people often were treated with horrific savagery by
the new settlers, most of them died through disease.
Their pathetic revenge: syphilis. Although it existed already in Europe, the
American strain was highly virulent. The returning adventurers brought it
back and the great pox swept the continent.
Columbus and his successors over the next 30 years paved the way for the
development for the first time of the 'global' economy. With the silver dug
out by hapless indians from the mines of Spain and Mexico, Europeans paid
for the spices and other goods which were being brought from Asia. Moreover,
tobacco, potatoes and other products from the new world were to change the
habits of the European people.
The interaction of the Spanish and the various Amerindian cultures differed
from region to region, the consequences of which can still be seen. The
urban cultures of the densest population - in Mexico, and of the Andean
societies - were easier for the conquerors to force into the colonial
economy. In Brazil, however (colonised by the Portuguese), and other
regions, the semi-nomadic natives could not be made to work. As a result,
large numbers of Africans were transported to the region as slaves.
The nature of medieval Spanish society was to make a permanent mark on Latin
America. It was also to permeate the north, becoming tied up with the myth
of the wild west. Spanish cattle farming techniques of the 12th century -
such as branding, lassoing and round-ups - were taken to the plains of South
America before they migrated north.
More fundamentally, the relationship between the Spanish ruling elites in
Latin America and the Spanish monarchy reflected that which existed between
the monarch and the Spanish baronies. This gave the colonial elites great
discretion to run their affairs, and to control indigenous populations, as
they pleased.
The rulers of the newly-independent Latin nations continued this tradition
in the 19th century, viewing the Indians as a threat to their emerging
nationhood. The consequences of all this can still be seen in the sharp
racial divisions in countries such as Peru, where the ruling elite still
largely considers itself European.
Another reason why Columbus manages to arouse such high emotions, five
centuries after his voyage, is that the issues raised by the European
colonisation of the Americas, and the subsequent transport of huge numbers
of Africans to work there, have yet to be resolved.
America's poor are overwhelmingly black or Indian, and the social injustices
of the European entry to the new world have not yet been addressed.
Following a decade which has seen a growing gap between rich and poor in
North America (because of the Reagan years) and in Latin America (because of
the debt crisis), this has hit a chord.
Columbus set in train a clash of three cultures: European, Amerindian and
African. The Indians and Africans did not voluntarily become adjuncts to the
European economy: they were forced to participate and, in its name, they
suffered agonies
The collision between the Indians and Europeans was inevitable. Historian
Edwin Williamson points out that the two groups had incompatible
expectations: Spain had a monetary economy in which gold was a scarce
resource and power was determined by control over labour.
The people of the Caribbean islands first encountered by Columbus lived in a
subsistence barter economy in which gold had an ornamental role and the idea
of labour service had not developed. The difference confirmed the European
prejudice, still to be heard in Latin capitals today, that Indians are
'lazy.'
The anniversary of Columbus appears, however, through media coverage, to
have raised consciousness in many parts of the world about the lot of the
American Indian. The prospect of celebrating the event, which many view with
horror, has made the Indians themselves more conscious of their own
identity, and encouraged some to use the mechanisms of Latin America's young
democracies to assert their rights.
Five hundred years after his voyage, Columbus might have performed a belated
service for Latin America's native cultures after all.

FOR MOST lovers of Oriental rugs old, traditional designs, handed down from
mother to daughter and from father to son, are an essential part of their
appeal.
Anything new-fangled or, heaven forbid, avant-garde, is regarded with grave
suspicion, on a par with altering the pageantry of the Changing of the Guard
or tampering with the recipe for Bath Olivers. Received wisdom has it that
you do not mess with ancient hallowed crafts.
Christopher Farr, a painter who also deals in Oriental rugs and who
especially loves fine old, traditional ones, has dared to do just that - he
has found a way of combining some of the best Western design talent with the
craft traditions that are still alive in many of the Turkish villages that
lie around the ancient pre-Ottoman capital of Seljuk.
He found, to his great surprise, that many of the carpet-makers were longing
for something a little new and challenging to work with. Many of them were
giving scarcely any thought to what they were doing; they were simply
repeating the designs handed down through the years without any great
engagement of their interest or their feelings.
Farr thinks the quality of the rugs is threatened not by the introduction of
new designs but by the increasing reliance on cheap wools and harsh dyes and
the evident boredom of many of the carpet-makers.
'A design is not automatically great simply because it is old,' says
Christopher Farr, 'I could not build a business on the finest quality old
rugs alone - they are now too expensive for this market - so I decided to
try to encourage the carpet-makers to make fine new ones.
'I insist that they use only hand-spun wool. It is very labour-intensive and
time-consuming but it gives light and depth to the carpet and takes colour
in a way that no machine-spun wool ever does.
For his first venture three years ago he got two young designers, Sian
Tucker and Kate Blee, to produce a few designs that fitted into the Turkish
weaving traditions and used the colours that were available to the weavers.
Encouraged by what he describes as the limited success of the venture last
year he brought together a group of six students at the Royal College of Art
to turn their creative talents to the problem.
'It was a huge success, about five hundred top designers came to the opening
exhibition, including luminaries such as Christian Lacroix, and we sold all
the eighteen designs on display.'
His latest venture has been to get another eight designers (including the
original pair of Sian Tucker and Kate Blee, as well as Maxime de la Falaise,
who designs for St. Laurent and Tiffany, Cressida Bell and Sally
Greaves-Lord) to see what they could come up with. 'The weavers seemed to
love having new designs to tackle and were intrigued by the range and
diversity of the them. '
The range of designs is very varied - some, like Cressida Bell's,
photographed left, clearly draw on traditional oriental rug design whilst
infusing it with new life and fresh colours, while Sally Greaves-Lord's
design, photographed right, is much more abstract, a real break with
accepted ideas of what Oriental rug design is all about.
Sian Tucker has produced a very painterly design - a dark chestnut frame or
'mount' with an inner square alive with smaller squares of rich colour,
while Maxime de la Falaise has produced a much more fanciful flat-weave
kelim, all ochres, blues and browns.
The rugs are coming into Christopher Farr's shop at 115 Regent's Park Road,
Primrose Hill, London NW1 now but there will have a more formal, big
exhibition of the complete range running for six weeks, starting on November
4.
Prices start at Pounds 750 and go on to Pounds 2,250. Each rug is produced
in an edition of 10.
Christopher Farr has lots more ventures in the pipe-line - particularly
exciting is the interest of Romeo Gigli, who is likely to be designing some
of the next range.

FT  10 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: Conran comes to Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR YEARS the Conran Shop has towered over the London design scene. There
are other shops selling contemporary furniture in the city. But it is the
only place where you can buy virtually everything, from a sofa to a soap
dish, and where you are tempted into spending more than you had expected.
The Conran Shop yesterday opened for business in Paris in a fin de siecle
building on the corner of rue du Bac and rue de Baylone in Saint Germain.
Sir Terence Conran, who created the original Conran Shop in 1973 and bought
it back two years ago when he left the Storehouse group, has been planning
the Paris opening for five years.
'We've opened the Conran Shop in Paris for exactly the same reason that we
opened in London,' says Sir Terence. 'There are lots of good, small,
interesting shops in Paris selling similar sorts of things but nowhere can
you find it all under the same roof."
Sir Terence is probably right. Paris is wonderful for antiques thanks to the
Marches aux Puces and the specialist dealers straggling the tiny streets
between Boulevard Saint Germain and the Seine and there are also many more
shops selling 20th century classics such as a Le Corbusier chaise longue or
an Arne Jacobsen Swan chair, than in London. But it is difficult to find the
classic Conran Shop style of quirkily classic contemporary furniture design
in Paris.
The range for the Conran Shop in Paris, which stretches over three floors in
the Bon Marches old storage depot now renovated at a cost of Pounds 3.6m, is
almost the same as in London. There is the same mix of the store's own
furniture (which will be shipped over to French customers from the British
factories) with classics, such as Joe Columbo's 1960s Boby trolley, and
cheaper treats, Czech &amp; Speake toiletries and hand-made chocolates.
The French like their sofas smaller and firmer than do the British, so some
Conran Shop classics, such as Odeon, a best seller in the London store, were
rejected as too big and squashy. The French also have different taste in
beds, so a special range has been commissioned in France.
The critical question is whether the French, who are notoriously
chauvinistic about anything to do with style, can be persuaded to buy
British for their homes.
There is the great advantage that Sir Terence already has a high profile in
France as the founder of Habitat, which has recently been conspicuously more
successful in the French market than the British. Sir Terence is also known
as an ardent francophile - one of the few traits that the French consider to
be redeeming in foreigners.
Sir Terence envisages 'very gentle, very modest' expansion for the Conran
Shop into other cities. But his plans depend on the progress of the new
Paris store and whether the French design cognoscenti take to Conran Shop
sofas and soap dishes as enthusiastically as their counterparts across the
English Channel.

FT  10 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: Bargains across the water - Sterling may
have slumped against the dollar, but buying from the US still makes sense if
you know what you want
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE dollar, the pound and the yen, not to mention the lira, the peseta
and the escudo zig-zag . . . sorry, float . . . around the world's markets,
those who keep their wits about them and move fast will find that there are
spectacular bargains to be had.
Now that credit cards, faxes and answering machines are an established part
of most commercial life there is hardly a country in the world, or an hour
in the day, when the shopaholic is out of danger. From a sitting-room in the
Outer Hebrides, a farmhouse in Wagga Wagga or even a hut in Timbuktu,
goodies can be summoned from Bloomingdales in Manhattan, discount stores in
the mid-West of the US, from emporia in Singapore, boutiques in Hong Kong.
All you need is your flexible friend and a telephone or fax.
The most accessible market of all to those of us who live in Britain is the
US, where a sophisticated infrastructure of toll-free phones, credit card
friendliness and a culture of making shopping care-free means it is almost
as easy to shop in Los Angeles, Chicago and Detroit as London, Edinburgh or
Reading.
The man who has done most of the legwork for those who fancy taking
advantage of lower US prices without forking out the air fare is Richard
McBrien, whose pamphlet, Buying Direct From the USA, is the bible of the
business. A new edition is published this week.
Apart from the list of mail order companies, with their telephone numbers
(some toll-free), he also gives British equivalents of American clothes and
shoes sizes, electric voltages, and a rundown of shipping costs, insurance,
duty and VAT.
Though the palmy days of the two-dollar pound are for the moment past (as I
write it stands at Dollars 1.69) McBrien is still convinced that, for whole
categories of goods, buying from the US makes sense.
Those who travel frequently to the US will already have wondered at the low
prices of clothing, sportswear (golf clubs, tennis balls, tennis racquets,
ski-wear are half price or less compared with the UK), cameras, CDs,
electronics and computers, but there are other good buys.
Contact lenses, for instance, are light and easy to post - you can just fax
your prescription to the National Contact Lens Center, Santa Rosa Optometry
Center, 3527 Bonita Vista Drive, Santa Rosa, CA 95404. A colleague bought a
French horn from Giardinellis of 7845 Maltlage Drive, Liverpool, NY 13090.
(tel: 315 652 4792; fax: 315 652 4534) for about half the UK price, and
though shipping would have added to the cost (he brought it home himself) he
still reckons it was an exceptionally good buy.
Certain cult names such as Patagonia have only limited distribution in the
UK so those who want goods that are not yet in the shops might like to
browse through the full brochure - beware, though, that the prices which
seem so cheap at first do not look so attractive when postage, duty and VAT
are added.
Rayban Wayfarers sunglasses, another cult item in certain circles, sell for
something like Pounds 69 in the UK but cost Dollars 60 in the US and have
the advantage of being easy to post.
Another attraction is the chance to buy items which are not available over
here at all - things such as Sheplers Western goods, shirts, mountaineering,
skiing and other outdoor gear. Then there are more esoteric goods such as
woodworking tools (but beware that electrical goods may not work in the UK
unless the voltage can be switched) or model kits which, according to
McBrien, are particularly well-priced in the US. And for those who cannot
live without a 'liquid gold sizzling jumpsuit', Bloomingdales will sell you
one for just Dollars 135.
The best value of all turned out to be goods such as computers and software.
A Microsoft Word for Windows software package costs the equivalent of about
Pounds 188 when ordered from Express Technology. With a Pounds 9 postage and
packing charge but no duty added it works out at well under half the average
retail price in the UK of Pounds 395.
As an exercise we rang many of the companies listed in the third edition of
McBrien's Buying Direct From The USA. We were often faced with answer
machines (he has excellent advice on how to telephone as economically as
possible) and, more often than not, an agreement to send a catalogue was not
followed by action, so you need to persevere. Mail order companies come and
go and telephone numbers change, which is why McBrien aims to update his
pamphlet every six weeks. The big established companies such as Saks Fifth
Avenue, Bloomingdales or Patagonia were, as a rule, more efficient than the
less established names.
Of many items that we checked out, it emerged that though initial savings
seem to be huge, the cost of postage and packing, insurance and duty can
make it uneconomical after all. So remember you should not do it all on
automatic pilot - you should watch the dollar's movement against the pound
and do some careful arithmetic before deciding if it is worth it.
A reader who got carried away by the LL Bean catalogue and ordered three
turtleneck sweaters (two for the knock-down bargain price of Dollars 8) and
a pair of trousers for a total of Dollars 78 (Pounds 43.80) found that
shipping via Federal Express cost Dollars 35.
'When the goods arrived,' her letter goes on, 'Federal Express required a
payment of Pounds 21.37 for import duty and VAT, an amount which I thought
extraordinary considering the dollar value of the goods. On calling Federal
Express for an explanation, I was told that the total value of goods and
shipping, ie Dollars 113, was converted to Pounds 62.94. Duty at 14 per cent
was calculated on this amount. The duty was then added, bringing a total of
Pounds 71.75, and VAT at 17.5 per cent was imposed.'
She adds ruefully: 'The clothes were probably still good value, largely due
to the sale price for the turtlenecks, but I am not sure if I will be
ordering anything further unless there are some changes to the charges
levied.'
Buying Direct from the USA by Richard McBrien costs Pounds 12.95 and can be
ordered from Running Heads International, Grove House, 82 East Dulwich
Grove, London SE22 8TW. Telephone and fax 071-738-4096.
Coming in January is International Shopping - yearly subscription of Pounds
45 or Pounds 3.50 an issue - which will cover the rest of the world -
invaluable for those who want presents delivered to cousins in Australia,
friends in Hong Kong or mothers in Canada. Just 'phone, quote your credit
card number and the present can be on its way.
If you do not want to write or ring each company directly an organisation
called Shop the World by Mail, PO Box 5549, Cary, North Carolina 27512, USA;
Fax 1-(919) 481-9369; will, for a fee, send you the catalogues from almost
every country in the world. You tick the names or the areas of interest and
the complete collection is sent to you. It will also organise magazine
subscriptions as gifts.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Gardening: Face the facts: fuchsias enjoy breaking rules -
Robin Lane Fox takes the RHS to task over a question of hardiness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST, we have a proper English autumn: green grass is framing damp
flowerbeds, berries are everywhere, and there are not so many wasps that
plums become too hot to handle. Much less has been heard about global
warming, except among those gardeners who have burnt their fingers bolting
to Tuscany. My violas are loving it all in full sun, refuting the usual view
that they must grow in shade and cool soil.
Fuchsias are loving it, too; these are plants we should not confine to
wretched hanging baskets. I suspect strongly that we under-estimate them:
many are hardier than we are all taught to believe.
The Royal Horticultural Society has just put its name to a new encyclopaedia
of gardening which is characteristically cautious: 'Breeders have produced a
vast range of hardy and slightly tender hybrids . . . most fuchsias cannot
tolerate intense sun . . . in cold areas, many may need frost protection in
winter . . ' The encyclopaedia names only one example of a hardy fuchsia:
Lady Thumb, a white and red flowered version of Tom Thumb which died with me
last winter.
Since the RHS refuses to face the fuchsia, I will rely on other sources:
what does that encyclopaedia think about the botanic garden in Leicester?
Three years ago, its curator showed me the sort of sight I relish: masses of
fuchsias growing happily from year to year in beds in full, hot sun.
The garden can list more than 70 varieties which break the supposed rules
and survive the winter in a garden which is not unduly sheltered.
Nonetheless, we are all taught that almost all fuchsias need shade and have
to spend the winter in a cool greenhouse. The bushes are never pruned until
spring, and their bare skeletons sometimes are protected with a mound of
earth or debris piled over their crowns.
Nowadays, we can all use Fibre Fleece instead, although the new
encyclopaedia does not even mention it. This is the brand name for rolls of
a protective white blanket which can be cut and pinned over any tender plant
during the next month. It keeps off most of the frost and allows water to
continue to permeate the ground. My results with it have been excellent.
Perhaps the thought of bare skeletons in the winter might deter you;, if so,
you should follow a trick used at Hidcote for many years. In the next few
weeks, plant bulbs of the bright blue scilla sibirica right up to the
fuchsia's main roots. They flower brilliantly in the spring before the
fuchsia regains its leaves, and they do not object to its competition.
The RHS encyclopaedia permits this trick, too: 'Choose just one cultivar per
container,' it tells us, 'as different cultivars grow at different rates.
Mixtures of fuchsias and other plants also make a successful display.'
Surely 'other plants' grow at different rates and, anyway, which others?
Fuchsias and French marigolds look awful, although they have been seen at
Wisley. As a gardener, I can never take too seriously advice which goes on
about 'cultivars' without being specific.
My second pillar is the Fuchsia Lexikon, by Ron Ewart, published in 1982 by
Blandford Press. Admittedly, he goes on about cultivars, too, but his book
is one for specific reference, not reading through, and it does give us an
expert's view of hundreds of varieties from Angela Rippon to Yum Yum. Ewart
was a professional grower for 20 years and served the Fuchsia Society in
high office. I trust him.
Even in 1982, after a frightful winter, he was prepared to name quite a
range of fuchsias as 'garden hardy': pink and mauve Elfin Glade, cerise and
purple Genii, old red and purple Brilliant, and many others like Henriette
Ernst and Marjorie Blake which you need to hunt out in your Plantfinder.
Whenever I have lost a Ewart selection, it has been my own fault; but, on
Leicester experience, the list of possible hardiness is even longer. Right
now, in Oxford, we have mature plants of the lovely Voltaire which are
flowering freely in a sunny position, having survived several winters, dry
summers, and the little ways of the student body. Yet, Voltaire is usually
marked as a half-hardy form.
During the next fortnight, you still have time to take cuttings of any
fuchsias you want to perpetuate. Almost all of them root with absurd ease in
a slightly warm place. By next year, they will be flowering, a wonderful
postscript to the season among pale blues, white, and soft colours. Back,
then, to the fuchsia - just the plant for traditional autumns if the weather
is planning to return to tradition.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Gardening: The charms of finding a stranger in your bed -
Chance seedlings can be worth encouraging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE a weakness for self-sown shrubs which bear the prospect of being
different. Cotoneasters are one, along with buddleias and the deciduous
varieties of euonymus. I am constantly finding cotoneaster seedlings in the
strangest places, coming out of crevices in walls or wedged against the bole
of a tree where they have been missed by the lawnmower.
With some species, you can be fairly certain from the outset about what
these seedlings are and their potential quality. Seedlings of C.
horizontalis are of this kind; in my experience, they always have the same
fishbone style of branching, ready to mould themselves to any firm surface
whether it be a wall, fence or tree stump, or to spread outwards over the
ground, layer upon layer. Usually, these seedlings differ only in the
quality of their flowers and berries, and in their ability to turn vivid
shades of yellow, orange and red in the autumn before the leaves fall.
Evergreen C. microphyllus is also one that is regular in character. Its
leaves are very small and dark green, its berries crimson, and its humped
stems excellent at moulding themselves over low walls or large rocks. A
little less certain is C. conspicuus, an evergreen species from Tibet which
always makes a dome-shaped bush but can vary greatly in ultimate size and
also in its ability to produce regular crops of scarlet fruits. At its best
it is superb and, though the berries look so good, birds shun them; thus,
they usually hang on well into the new year.
C. franchetii is totally different. It has long, flexible stems which arch
outwards all around it, eventually making a big, loose bush with tapering
evergreen leaves. From September on, it produces heavy crops of fruits born
in clusters.
There is a form of it which, for many years, I called C. wardii - until I
read that the true bearer of this name was unlikely to be in cultivation and
that the plants really are C. sternianus. As the leaves become old they turn
orange, and the bush is among the brightest in the garden, but this is a
quality that can differ from one seedling to another.
C. salicifolius identifies itself by its long, narrow leaves, like those of
a willow but evergreen. It can be 10 to 15 ft high and as much in diameter,
so that a chance seed that decides to germinate in the middle of a flower
border can become an embarrassment in a few years. But this is a very
variable plant in size and habit, and some of its seedlings are sufficiently
dense and low to be used as ground cover.
This excellent species does not seem to be quite certain whether it is
evergreen or deciduous, but this might be because it crosses readily with
other species, including C. frigidus which does lose its leaves in winter.
If, like me, you let chance seedlings stay out of curiosity, it could well
be that what you are calling a species is, in fact, a garden mongrel. This
bothers me only when visitors press for instant names and I have to confess
I am not sure.
A very fine cotoneaster named watereri is rated officially as a hybrid
between C. frigidus and an evergreen species named C. henryanus. This is
said to have appeared as a chance seedling from C. frigidus in the Bagshot,
Surrey, nursery of John Waterer &amp; Sons. A selected form of it, kept true to
type by being grown from cuttings, is still sold as C. John Waterer.
This is the kind of plant you should get if you do not want to play around
with the uncertainty of seedlings. I think that, basically, gardeners are of
two kinds: those who bother a lot about purity of variety and correct
naming, and those who find it rather fun to have plants which are beautiful
but which they are unable to identify precisely.
C. dielsianus is a true species that is very free with its seedlings. It is
deciduous and its long stems arch gracefully outwards. There is a seedling
of it in my garden which I intend to remove as soon as it has lost its
berries because it is taking up too much room and interfering with the grass
mowing. I could prune it, but that would spoil its shape. So, I am content
to let it go as there are others like it elsewhere.
The lowest growing of the cotoneaster is dammeri, which covers the ground
with a carpet of evergreen leaves although it is only dwarf in height.
Sideways, it seems capable of going on forever, rooting into the soil as it
grows. It is a favourite with landscapers, who use it to cover banks and
also to smother weeds.
I do not grow it and cannot say how it fares from seed, but I doubt there is
a lot of variation. There is, however, a variety named Skogholm which is at
least twice the height of the type plant. In the beginning, this probably
was just another of those chance seedlings that was left to see how it would
fare. But there might from the outset have been some hint of difference that
aroused curiosity. That is the way a good many fine plants originate.

Cyclamen hederaefolium
Hederaefolium means ivy-leaved which very aptly describes the leaves of this
delightful little hardy cyclamen - except that every plant is different and
all are mottled dark green and silver, some much more elaborately than
others. The flowers are pink or white and usually produce seed freely which,
in favourable places, means that the plants sometimes spread of their own
accord. Sometimes they appear a long way from the parent plant. This
cyclamen likes semi-shade and cool, humus-rich soil and is an ideal plant
for naturalising beneath deciduous trees not too closely planted. It makes a
solid tuber which gets bigger and bigger but never splits and, so far as I
know, cannot be divided. Seed is the only method of increase.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Motoring: Real cars, real people, real French flair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORGET the 200 miles-an-hour follies and the spare-no-expense creations for
motoring's mega-rich. Small is beautiful at Mondial de l'Automobile, the
French car industry's biennial show that opened in Paris on Thursday.
At the centre of attention are two little cars that will be bought by real
people, using real money they have worked hard to earn and on which they
have paid taxes. Making their world debut are the Renault Twingo and the
Nissan Micra.
The Twingo is sub-Renault Clio in size and styled with the same flair that
has made the Renault Espace Europe's leading multi-purpose vehicle for many
years. While the Micra - now being made alongside the medium-sized Primera
in the Nissan plant at Washington, north-east England - is a little bigger
than the Twingo, it is small enough to feel at home in crowded city streets
but has enough space to let four adults sit in tolerable comfort on a
journey.
The Twingo will lock horns with Fiat's Cinquecento, a perky little town car
looking like a Fiat Uno's baby brother. The Cinquecento, already selling
well on mainland Europe, is due in Britain by the end of the year.
Many Britons will be disappointed that Renault has no plans at present to
make the Twingo with right-hand drive. In France, it will go on sale early
in 1993 at an anticipated FFr55,000. That is more than Pounds 6,700 in
devalued sterling although a month ago, when Renault unveiled the Twingo,
the price tag would have been nearer Pounds 5,500.
There will be only one Twingo model: a 55-horsepower, 1.2-litre, three-door
hatchback with a five-speed gearbox and a top speed of 95 mph (153 kph).
There are just two extras: a fabric sun-roof and air-conditioning.
Many of the 35,000 Micras to be made in 1993 will go to mainland Europe to
compete with the likes of the Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio, Peugeot 106 and 205
and Fiat Uno. Britons will get first sight of it at the Birmingham
International motor show later this month, and it goes on sale in the UK in
January.
Although the British-made Micra is 60mm (more than two inches) shorter than
the old Japanese-made model it is taller, has a longer wheelbase and is
bigger inside. There are two multi-valve engines of 1.1 and 1.3 litres'
capacity, and a choice of five-speed manual or Nissan's continuously
variable automatic transmissions.
Although small, it is sophisticated. Options will include a tilt-and-slide
sunroof, power steering, anti-lock brakes and air-conditioning.
More and more Europeans who buy cars of modest size and price now are
demanding air-conditioning. They find today's large, sloping windscreens
attract enough sun-radiated heat to make interiors very uncomfortable
without it. Renault used Harrison, an American air-conditioning giant, to
produce the optional extra system for the Twingo. Diavia of Italy's
after-market system for the Fiat Cinquecento incorporates many of the same
US-made components.
At the Paris show, Peugeot has introduced the long-awaited diesel and
five-door versions of the 106. Diesel fuel is roughly two-thirds the price
of unleaded petrol in France and more than 40 per cent of all
newly-registered cars there have diesel engines, with 50 per cent on the
horizon.
With unleaded petrol at around Pounds 3 a gallon (66p a litre) and diesel
Pounds 2 (44p a litre), the economic argument is compelling even without
putting the diesel's 30 per cent lower consumption into the equation.
Peugeot also is showing the revamped 405 range and a two-litre,
turbo-charged and petrol-engined 605. The 405, which will be unveiled for
Britons at Birmingham, has a new interior and a better boot. Engine options
now include the outstanding 1.9 turbo-diesel seen first in the Citroen ZX
1.9td.
I took a heavily-loaded ZX 1.9td to France last month. Despite a lot of
cruising at the 130 kmh (81 mph) autoroute limit, it returned better than 50
mpg (5.65 l/100 km) and drove with a petrol car's vigour and refinement.
Citroen's two-door ZX models made a Paris debut. These, too, will be at
Birmingham.
Rover cars are among Britain's most visible exports in France, none more so
than the Range Rover, which the trendy and well-heeled consider the vehicle
in which to be seen. The new, 4.2-litre, Pounds 39,995 LSE flagship of the
Range Rover line (this column, last week), with its height-adjustable air
suspension, was seen for the first time at Paris.
Ominously, so was Chrysler Jeep's Grand Cherokee. This four-litre six or
5.2-litre, V8-engined rival to the Range Rover reaches Europe in January. It
will be the first on-off road 4x4 with a driver's side air-bag, Although the
price will be a great deal lower, it will not have the aristocratic -
indeed, regal - connections that do so much for the British vehicle's image
and sales overseas.
Rover also chose Paris to launch the most potent car it has produced, the
220 Coupe Turbo. This front wheel-driven, 200-horsepower, 150 mph (241 kph)
two-plus-two has a traction control system to assure driveability on
slippery surfaces.
The Paris Mondial de l'Automobile continues all next week at the Porte de
Versailles exhibition complex. Arguably, it has upstaged the Birmingham
show, which opens to the public on October 24.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Property: Mayfair - simply the best address in town -
Offices are giving way to top-drawer flats and houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE builders at work all over Mayfair these days. Georgian, Victorian
and Edwardian houses used since the second world war as 'temporary' offices
are being converted back to residential use. This will, once again, make
Mayfair the best address in London - as it is on the Monopoly board.
Richard Crosthwaite, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, has identified 42 development
schemes with planning permission from the City of Westminster to create 199
houses and flats in Mayfair. The Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate
alone has 84 buildings that were used as offices; most of them will become
15 houses and 139 flats. The first to be tackled was 6 Aldford Street, an
Edwardian building that was switched from offices to five flats in 1988.
The first house on the estate to be restored for family occupation was 7
Upper Brook Street. Because of structural defects, part of this Grade
II-listed building had to be rebuilt to make it a gracious, six-bedroom,
Georgian town house on six floors. It was sold through Savills last year for
more than Pounds 1m with a new 65-year lease, and is now back on the market
for sale through Egerton (071-493-0676) at Pounds 1.4m.
But the estate took four years to reach agreement with Westminster's
planners on the future of 57 of its properties where it argued that
conversion was either unsuitable or not economic. In the end, the council
agreed that permanent office use should be allowed for 161,395 sq ft of
floor space, but the remaining buildings would have to be restored or
redeveloped to create five houses and 92 flats.
One of the largest schemes will be converting Taylor Woodrow's former
offices of 29,000 sq ft at 8-12a Park Street and 1-5 Rex Place, which the
estate sold this summer through Wetherell and Savills for more than Pounds
3m to an overseas client of Citibank. The buildings will become three houses
and 11 flats with garaging for 14 cars.
The estate has just completed Avery Court, a block of six new flats in the
newly pedestrianised Avery Row, which runs between Brook and Grosvenor
streets. Five one-bedroom flats are for sale through Debenham Tewson
Residential (071-408-1161) at prices from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 200,000
on new 75-year leases, and the sixth is a two-bedroom flat at Pounds
285,000. The estate also is near to completing the conversion of 106-114
Park Street into 11 flats, with prices expected to range between Pounds
225,000 to Pounds 350,000 through WA Ellis (071-581-7654).
One of the most celebrated cases of a 'temporary' office permission is Brook
House in Park Lane, which was built in 1930 as a block of luxury flats. The
40-room penthouse on the top two floors was the London home of the Earl and
Countess Mountbatten.
Brook House was converted into offices soon after the blitz of 1940, and
from 1964 was the headquarters of Britain's second-largest property company,
MEPC. Having failed in 1988 to win consent for continued office use, MEPC
and Grosvenor Estate Holdings sold Brook House in April this year for Pounds
9.1m to a consortium of overseas investors.
The buyers have been given a new 105-year lease by the Grosvenor Estate, but
are required by December 1995 either to refurbish the building as flats or
to redevelop it as 17 new luxury flats, with 15,000 sq ft of banking and
ancillary offices on the ground and first floors and underground parking for
39 cars (for which planning permission has been obtained).
Another large block of properties in Mayfair forms the Ropemaker Estate,
owned by British Petroleum's pension fund. Agreement has been reached with
Westminster to restore 12 buildings as 37 houses or flats, the first of
which - at 33-35 Hill Street and 27-30 Hays Mews - are being refurbished or
reconstructed to create 12 flats and six mews houses. These will be released
for sale later this year through Debenham Tewson Residential.
Offices once occupied by the Randsworth Trust, at 78 Mount Street, have been
restored as a six-bedroom house for which offers of Pounds 4.6m are being
invited through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) and Wetherell
(071-493-6935).
The former London home of the Duchess of Argyll at 48 Upper Grosvenor Street
is for sale at Pounds 2m through Chesterfield (071-5781-4234) and Egerton.
Another Pounds 2m is being sought by Chesterfield for the modern house
immediately behind it in Reeves Mews. This residence recently has been
rebuilt completely. On the opposite side of the road, 8 Upper Grosvenor
Street is about to be redeveloped by Goshawk Developments to designs by
Michael Blampied &amp; Partners. These will create 5,000 sq ft of offices behind
its listed Lutyens facade, and seven new flats with underground parking for
eight cars in Blackburne's Mews, at the back of the American Embassy.
A recently reconstructed house in Farm Street is for sale at Pounds 1.7m
with a 95-year lease through Lassmans (071-499-3434) and Henry Pryor's newly
formed agency, the London Office (071-439-3900). This four-bedroom house has
the advantage of a double garage - rare in Mayfair.
Several well-known businessmen are trying to sell their Mayfair homes. Asil
Nadir paid about Pounds 1.25m for his house in Aldford Street, which his
bankers now are offering for sale with a 65-year lease at Pounds 850,000
through Debenham Tewson Residential. Gerald Ratner's house in Balfour Mews,
which he bought three years ago for Pounds 2.3m, is for sale at Pounds 1.5m
on a 38-year lease through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Beauchamp Estates
(071-629-1077). Meanwhile, advertising tycoon Maurice Saatchi has had to
reduce the price of his 7,500 sq ft Lees House to Pounds 3m through
Lassmans. It was on offer for more than Pounds 5m two years ago.
Ancaster House, in Chesterfield Gardens, was sold this summer for close to
Pounds 20m to an overseas buyer who will convert it into a 12-bedroom
mansion. But the deal has revived hopes that another great Mayfair mansion
will be restored to residential use: Aberconway House at 38 South Street,
built in 1920-22 as the London residence of the second Lord Aberconway but
used as the headquarters of the Rank Organisation until 1985.
The Grosvenor Estate is looking for a buyer to use its 25,000 sq ft as a
private house or an ambassadorial residence (for which its magnificent
entrance hall, ballroom and 30-seat dining room are appropriate). Offers of
Pounds 6.5m are being sought for a new 75-year lease through Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley and Wetherell.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Property: Delightful duo in the best of Bath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHOLE HOUSES in the magnificent Royal Crescent in Bath appear rarely on the
market as only six have not been divided up. So, two on sale side by side at
the same time represents an extraordinary opportunity.
Most of the other houses in the crescent are begrimed in soot but numbers 21
and 22 stand out for their scrubbed Bath stone and for the famous yellow
door of No 22.
The Yellow Door Dispute was high theatre early in the 1970s when its owner,
the redoubtable Annabel Wellesley-Colley, decided to paint it that colour.
Why yellow, when all the other front doors were white or natural wood (as
they remain)? She was protesting against the council's act of painting
yellow parking lines on the 18th century pave in the crescent.
She was taken to court but fought her case to appeal and, eventually,
secured the right to paint her front door as she wished. And yellow it
remains today - as are the lines in the street on the side next to the top
lawn, for which residents pay Pounds 8 a year for their private use, behind
rails and inside a ha-ha.
Of all Bath's townscapes, the Royal Crescent gives the grandest sense of
Palladio transposed to Somerset. Built in 1767-75 by James Wood the younger,
it was the last part of the original schemes for Bath. It still astonishes
for the contrast verging on absurd between the urban sophistication of its
great curve and the quasi-country of the lawn and Victoria Park, even though
sheep and cattle no longer graze there. One repaired to the Royal Crescent
'to breathe the fresh air of better company,' wrote Jane Austen, disparaging
the vulgarity that, by her time, had taken over the Assembly Rooms and Pump
Room in the centre of town.
The two houses, on sale separately or together through Knight, Frank &amp;
Rutley (0285-659771) at guide prices of Pounds 900,000 and Pounds 975,000,
share a huge attraction. Both are in tip-top condition, re-leaded,
re-plumbed, re-roofed, glazing bars put back and stone cleaned. Each has a
self-contained basement flat, six bedrooms and six baths. The hall floors
have diamond patterns in white Bath stone and black slate; and icing sugar
plasterwork abounds. In this 18th century oasis, the living rooms will look
their best if the new owners follow the Georgians and keep to polished
floors and rugs.
The view on the crescent side looks across the lawn down to the centre of
Bath; at the back, it is up the hill through a forest of chimneys. The curve
of the crescent makes the back gardens private, so that only the next-doors
can see you sunbathing. Most of the street is round the bend.
Who will live in one of the world's best addresses? For an extended family,
the pair of houses would be a fine place. There is plenty of room to include
grandparents, maiden aunts and unemployed young - and to give parties. That
is what these grand houses were designed for.
Help will be essential, but a cleaner can be found in Bath for around Pounds
3.50 an hour. And when mother tires of cooking, the dining room of the Royal
Crescent Hotel makes an excellent, although not cheap, neighbourhood
watering hole.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The messiah of bounce who makes
his disciples jump - Keith Wheatley meets the former fish farmer putting a
new spring into the British way of leisure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the success of Neighbours, there remains a fault-line difference
between how the young of Australia and Britain experience childhood. A
trampoline in the garden is the birthright of every young Aussie. Rugged and
cheap, they help pass weekends and school holidays until Bruce is old enough
for a driving licence. In the UK, however, trampolines are seldom found
outside schools and sports clubs.
Gradually, the situation is changing, thanks to former trout farmer Chris
Prentis and his company, Supertramp. This year, it will sell garden
trampolines worth Pounds 225,000 at prices ranging from Pounds 139 to Pounds
1,299 for the biggest Super-Kangaroo model. As the name might suggest,
Australia figures large in the genesis of this business.
In 1984, Prentis returned to England after a spell farming in Western
Australia. He had three young daughters who missed not so much the Wide
Brown Land as a daily bounce on their own trampoline. 'I couldn't believe it
but there wasn't a company in the UK that could sell us a simple,
weather-proof trampoline to keep out in the garden,' recalls Prentis.
'We were in the early days of creating a trout farm, but I designed and had
built about half a dozen trampolines. I sold them a via a free ad in a
farming magazine. We did incredibly un-businesslike things such as driving
one right up to North Yorkshire ourselves when we had a customer there.'
Nowadays, Supertramp's customer base extends from Argentina to Senegal and
there are no more personal deliveries.
Building trampolines from locally-sourced components was Prentis's first -
and avowedly last - experience of British industry. 'When we wanted springs,
we sent a sample and said 'Like this, please.' But 70 per cent were
unusable.' Had Supertramp stuck with local manufacture and assembly, the
business would never have got past being another kitchen-table hobby.
The account books from that period show trampolines as just another column
in the farm sales ledger, next to smoked trout pate and whole fish. What
convinced Prentis he was on the track of something worthwhile was the
reaction of every customer - and their friends - once they had seen a
trampoline in action.
'There's always a problem marketing an unknown product - and the garden
trampoline bears little relation in use to the item that people reluctantly
encountered in the gym when they were at school,' explains Prentis, a
down-to-earth countryman in his late 40s and an unlikely messiah of bounce.
'But everyone who's had one at home for a week knows that their kids would
never give it up.'
Five years ago, he discovered a Queensland firm that would supply flatpack
trampolines, albeit in full container loads. This was the turning point for
Supertramp. Prentis family cars were expelled from the barn as hundreds of
Action Goliaths were unloaded and stacked in the medieval gloom.
The business has never had any specific capitalisation, evolving out of the
general farm trading overdraft of around Pounds 70,000. Initially, the need
to provide substantial letters of credit two or three times a year to
finance a container load of trampolines meant individual negotiation with
the local high street bank, but these transactions have become regular
enough now to be subsumed into the general trading account.
One question that remains unsolved is how best to market and promote the
product. Prentis says he has no budget for a big advertising campaign,
although a weekly classified in Exchange &amp; Mart continues to pay dividends.
'The British people don't grab hold of new ideas with any significant
enthusiasm,' he says. This meant it paid to have entry-level models at only
a couple of hundred pounds as well as the bigger versions at around Pounds
1,000.
Demonstrations at county shows and country fairs proved a strong marketing
ploy, although enormously time-consuming for a man who was also trying to
catch and smoke trout from two lakes outside his home. A display troupe was
formed and toured England in an old coach bearing the conspicuous sign
Supertramp - thus starting rumours a few years ago that the rock group of
that name had retired and taken up fish farming in Devon.
'Initially, we thought we just had to give demonstrations, but gradually we
realised that we had to be part of the entertainment and that letting people
pay and spend five minutes bouncing was the answer,' explains Prentis.
Although shows are fewer in number now, they still provide great visibility
and a big sales peak in the weeks immediately afterwards.
By 1988, the trampolines' column in the ledger had begun to eclipse the
trout sales, so Prentis decided to close the fish operation in the spring of
1989 after a winter nearly devoid of essential rain. 'We were selling all we
could produce, but the operation was just too small to create enough
turnover for more than a proprietor doing all the work. Anyway, I wanted to
spend time on the trampolines.'
Supertramp has just two full-time employees, Prentis and an office
administrator, with warehouse and marketing staff brought in as necessary.
The company has yet to report a profit, although the owner says it could if
he were to change the policy of directing all spare resources at the search
for market growth. There are encouraging signs from agents in Italy and the
Netherlands, as well as a network of 200 sport shop agents in the UK.
'Talk about green. We didn't know anything about trampolines or the leisure
business,' laughs Prentis as he looks back. 'All businesses are a voyage of
discovery. Do you reach the golden fleece before you come unglued at the
bank?'

FT  10 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Stocks and shareware - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARE portfolio would seem an ideal application for computer monitoring.
Finding (or devising) a program to satisfy all requirements is remarkably
difficult.
Every investor needs to know how much each of their shares cost. Not just
the cost of the original purchase, but the subsequent history of additions
and subtractions through warrants, options, additional purchases, partial
sales, rights issues, scrip issues, shares accepted in lieu of dividends;
not to mention takeovers, mergers, or simple name-changes. Shares held for
any length of time can acquire a history of Byzantine complexity, and the
best way of dealing with it will probably always be a loose-leaf notebook
with a page for each shareholding.
Beyond that basic requirement, different investors want to know different
things. Active traders like graphs and understand what an oscillator is.
Americans like to contemplate their Return on Investment  - roughly, capital
gains (or losses) plus dividends as a percentage of the original investment.
I believe that a well-balanced portfolio is best left to its own devices for
much of the time, but I need to know which shares are pulling their weight
over the longer term.
I have been trying out a range of computer portfolio programs, from
shareware through cheap-and-simple up to fully-complicated.
If you like messing around with computers, you should explore shareware.
There are thousands of shareware programs; every computer magazine carries
the advertisements for them. You pay a small fee, Pounds 2-Pounds 3, for the
disk the program comes on, and for the distributor's trouble. If you like
the program and want to go on using it, you are supposed to send some money
to its author.
The idea could only be American. The sort of preposterous honesty required
to make such a system work is commoner, I think, among Americans than
Europeans. As a result, most shareware programs, including all the
stockmarket ones I could find, are American.
Shareware programs cover the full range - you can get databases,
spreadsheets, and word processors. But most are smaller programs designed
for specific tasks. Most were written by lonely enthusiasts and have an
idiosyncratic air. Some are really quite useful.
You need an elementary amount of computer savvy to get started, as all you
will get from the distributor is a disk or two. You may need courage and
patience - a shareware program is guaranteed to work on its author's
computer, but could freeze yours solid.
The disk you receive will almost certainly contain the text of a manual
which you can print out. Paying the author may get you a printed manual and
a more up-to-date version of the program; or may provide nothing except a
glow of satisfaction.
Portfolio monitoring is a popular area for shareware authors. Most programs
probably began life looking after their authors' portfolios. Many claim
specifically to have been written because the authors could not get exactly
what they wanted any other way. This means that there is likely to be a
program somewhere whose approach to the problem is congenial with your own.
The terminology of US investing can seem odd. But if you remember that they
quote share prices in dollars, not pennies, and that each US share has a
unique short code name - its 'ticker code' - which your program will surely
ask for, the transition is not impossible. Two problems I found insoluble:
north American newspapers list shares in alphabetical order; I could not
find a shareware program that would let me arrange a portfolio by sectors,
in Financial Times order, so that I would not have to wave the newspaper
around so much when I was updating the prices.
Of the programs I succeeded both in installing on my computer and
subsequently understanding, I liked Personal Portfolio Management best. It
really is 'intuitive' - the jargon word of praise for a straightforward
program. It draws nice graphs. It can manipulate your data to produce a
considerable number of useful reports. It can deal with as many shares as
your hard disk has room for.
I also liked an odd program called PFROI, standing for Portfolio Return on
Investment.
PFROI is certainly not intuitive. Once mastered, however, it is not
difficult to use. It provides a record of share transactions and dividend
receipts as well as calculating the return on individual shares and on the
portfolio as a whole from any point in the past to any other point - once
you have typed in the data, of course. It can handle the excitements of an
active trader's life, as well as your great aunt's quieter portfolio. No
graphs, alas.
If the idea of shareware appeals, try several programs. One of the ones
which baffled me completely might be just what you are looking for.
Personal Portfolio Management is available from Ensign Systems, London SE26
5BR; 081-778-2871. A catalogue is available on disk for 90p in stamps:
specify 3 1/2 or 5 1/4 .
PFROI is available from Shareware Marketing, 3A Queen St, Seaton, Devon EX12
2NY; 0297- 24088. Their catalogue is free and is printed.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fixing your mortgage rate - Avoiding
some of the pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The property market recovery is still some way off but many first time
buyers are now starting to wonder whether the time is right to buy a house.
Interest rates have come down, albeit in yo-yo fashion, from 15 per cent
three years ago to 9 per cent today and house prices fell by an alarming 3.1
per cent last month, according to the Halifax building society.
Downward pressure on interest rates continues but the fall in the value of
sterling means that a rise in base rates, if only for a short time, cannot
be ruled out. Deciding between fixed, capped and variable mortgages is one
problem. Where to go for your mortgage is another. And, if you already have
a mortgage, is it worth switching between a fixed rate and variable
mortgage, or moving to another lender?
LENDERS HAVE had a difficult time in the last three years. Now they are
trying to pull in business with bargain basement rates for first time buyers
but customers should beware: miscellaneous fees and charges can make a nasty
dent.
These include early redemption penalties - the fee for early repayment of
the loan, usually expressed as several months interest payments. There may
also be another charge, called a sealing fee, when you pay off your loan.
Look out too for product tie-ins. First-time buyers, for example, will
usually find that their discount is conditional on taking out
insurance-related products, which bring the lender commission from the
insurance companies and which you are likely to find more cheaply elsewhere.
Ask yourself how well lenders treat existing borrowers. Lenders want to
attract new customers and are much slower to pass on the benefit of interest
rate cuts to existing borrowers. Some building societies, for example,
Bristol &amp; West, are not reducing their rates to existing customers until
December.
TO FIX OR NOT TO FIX?
The government's short-lived attempt on Black Wednesday at putting base
rates up to 15 per cent, in spite of the recession's depth, shows how the
impossible can happen. Many city analysts expect rates to fall but pressure
on sterling and the absence of a clear economic policy mean there is the
risk of a yo-yo route to lower interest rates again.
For this reason, many people may find appeal in the security of a fixed-rate
mortgage. The drawback with these (apart from an interest rate fall), are
the fees. Also, they are rarely available on a repayment mortgage. The rate
is usually fixed for a relatively short period so borrowers should make sure
that the lender offers a competitive variable rate mortgage.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is offering one of the best fixed-rate mortgages on
the market. Fixed at 8.25 per cent for two years, the arrangement fee is a
relatively sober Pounds 100 and it is available on all mortgages but the
redemption penalty is three months interest. The rate compares favourably
with current variable rates of around 9.99 per cent. C&amp;G's own variable rate
is 9.75 per cent.
Abbey National has launched a fixed-rate mortgage at 8.49 per cent until
November 1994, available on endowment, repayment, and investment-linked
mortgages. But there is a Pounds 250 administration fee and a charge of 90
days interest if the mortgage is redeemed before the fixed rate term ends.
The clearing banks offer fixed rate mortgages less often than other lenders
but this week National Westminster put three fixed-rate mortgages on the
market. These are aimed at new borrowers, rather than existing ones, who can
fix their payments at 8.99 per cent (APR 10.3 per cent) until October 31
1994 or 9.49 per cent (10.3 per cent APR) until October 31 1997 or 9.99 per
cent until 2002.
There are arrangement fees of Pounds 195 for the two year mortgage and
Pounds 250 for the five and ten-year ones. Early redemption penalties vary
from two to six months interest.
Midland has three and five year fixed rates for endowment and pension
mortgages at 9.49 per cent and its existing variable rate customers can
switch into the fixed rate. There are two strings: a fee of Pounds 195 and
an obligation to arrange any new endowment insurance through Midland Life.
If you think that interest rates will fall two or three percentage points
further, but do not feel confident to rule out base rate increases, capped
products - mortgages which have a fixed ceiling to their interest rates but
which can fall below it in line with the market - can be a compromise.
For example, Stroud &amp; Swindon Building Society has launched a limited issue
fixed rate mortgage which offers a fixed rate at 8.25 per cent for the first
six months and a capped rate for the next 18 months of the mortgage term.
This is an interest-only mortgage: there is no need to assign life policies
to the society. But there is an application fee of Pounds 150 and the
mortgage is tied to the sale of building insurance cover from the society.
DO YOU ALREADY HAVE A MORTGAGE?
Few lenders offer fixed-interest mortgages targeted at their existing
borrowers - these appear at times when lenders want to avoid having existing
customers poached - but, if you are an existing borrower with a loan from
Bristol &amp; West, the tenth largest building society, you can take advantage
of its 'Cascade' mortgage, to reduce your payments by 3 per cent to 7.99 per
cent over 15 months.
It is worth noting, however, that Bristol &amp; West has one of the highest
standard mortgage rates of any large society - 10.24 per cent. There is an
administration fee of Pounds 195 and an early redemption penalty of interest
to the end of the month plus three months interest.
If you are stuck in an unsatisfactory mortgage, think hard before
converting. The costs of arranging a new mortgage, even with the same lender
can outweigh the potential savings. Mark Bolland of fee-based advisers
Chamberlain de Broe says, 'It is highly unlikely that it will be in most
people's interest to convert.'
He gives the example of someone stuck with a fixed rate mortgage of 10.5 per
cent until the end of 1993 - another 15 months. If their loan is Pounds
100,000, the net monthly payments would be Pounds 809.38 on an interest-only
loan. The payments on a variable rate mortgage of 9.75 per cent would be
Pounds 751.56 - a difference of Pounds 57.82 per month and, therefore, a
saving of Pounds 867.23 over the same period, assuming the variable rate did
not change.
But to get out of the fixed rate mortgage, you will have to pay a penalty,
usually three months gross interest, in this case, Pounds 2,625. Add to this
a conversion charge of perhaps Pounds 250 and you will have paid Pounds
2,875 in order to make a 'saving' of Pounds 867.23.
Even if you wanted to swap your fixed rate of 10.5 per cent for a fixed rate
of 8.5 per cent over the same period, you would lose out. The new monthly
interest payment would be Pounds 655.21 against Pounds 809.38 - a saving of
Pounds 2,312.55.
Transferring to a new lender would be even more expensive since it means
facing the full costs of re-mortgaging. DO YOU NEED A BROKER?
If you know what you want, you can go straight to the bank or building
society of your choice. But mortgage brokers can come in useful if your
needs are more complicated because of their knowledge of the market and
contacts. But beware whom you go to.
You should make sure that the broker you select is not going to sell you an
insurance product. That means paying a fee to the broker, likely to be
equivalent to around 0.5 per cent of the mortgage loan. A good broker will
not only scan the market but should offer views on lenders.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mulcahy's Pounds 1m - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE TRANSACTION stands out above all others this week. Geoffrey Mulcahy, the
chairman and chief executive of the stores group Kingfisher, exercised an
option of 374,475 shares and sold the resulting holding. In the process, he
made a gross profit of just over Pounds 1m by taking advantage of a sharp
rise in the share price following sterling's devaluation.
Three directors in CRT Group, formerly Smallshaw Knitwear, have been selling
stock just below a pound. Now quoted under business services and operating
in consultancy and recruitment services, the company's earnings record has
proved more consistent in recent times.
All three of the directors selling shares retain close to 500,000 each.
Evidence of further support for the media group WPP will cheer those who see
the stock as a classic recovery play. Martin Sorrell, the chief executive,
has bought a further 100,000 shares at 34.5p, having purchased 100,000 at
39p in mid-August.
Earlier this summer, the company completed a complex capital restructuring.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The advantages of buying British -
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST expatriates know that non-residence status, combined with placing their
savings overseas, is all they need to keep their investment income beyond
the reach of UK tax. So, it might be a surprise to learn that British
investments can sometimes be more tax-efficient.
Take tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas). Anyone is entitled to
accumulate up to Pounds 9,000 in a Tessa over five years, free of any UK tax
on the income. Of course, your overseas investment income also is exempt
whilst your non-residence continues but, by building up a Tessa, you can
curtail the tax liability you would face if you return to live in the UK.
And the yield is likely to be as good, or better, than anything available
elsewhere.
Personal equity plans can be even more beneficial, since you can invest
Pounds 9,000 every year.
A fundamental difference between Tessas and Peps is that, normally, the
latter are available only if you are resident and ordinarily resident in the
UK (although an exception is made for crown servants who can invest
regardless of their status).
But many people who regard themselves as expatriates are, in fact, UK
resident (sometimes, without realising it).
Often, this can arise from making visits to the UK at a time when living
accommodation is available there. This does not apply to anyone who has
employment or business which (apart from any incidental UK duties) is
carried on wholly overseas. But it does apply to air crew, directors of UK
companies, sailors, and others who perform substantial (that is, not
incidental) duties in the UK and have accommodation available there.
The most numerous group of 'resident expatriates' is wives who do not
themselves have full-time employment overseas. All these people can, if
resident and ordinarily resident in the UK, invest in Peps and there can be
considerable advantages in doing so. Consider, for example, a family
consisting of resident wife and non-resident husband who propose to return
to the UK for residence in 10 years' time.
By taking up her full entitlement of Peps every year, the wife could build
up a portfolio of Pounds 90,000, plus growth, even before the move takes
place and could continue to enjoy tax-free income and capital gains from it
indefinitely thereafter. By contrast, all the family's other
currently-exempt income and gains become taxable in full immediately the
change of residence occurs.
Care is necessary, though. Anyone taking up a Pep must declare that they are
resident and ordinarily resident in the UK.
They cannot do that and deny the effect of that status on any other income
and gains to which they are entitled.
Consider again those wives without full-time overseas employment.
Long-standing Inland Revenue practice - now enshrined in extra-statutory
concession A78 - means that many whose husbands are employed overseas for
three years or more (or would be, but for some unexpected termination) can
be regarded as not ordinarily resident in the UK throughout.
They do not have to accept this concessional treatment, but failure to do so
could result in UK tax liability on their overseas income (and, as UK
residents, they already face such a liability on their capital gains).
The problem usually can be overcome by holding most of the overseas
investments in the sole name of the non-resident husband, with the wife
retaining only those from which the income and gains are covered fully by
her available personal allowances.
For the aircrew, company directors and the others referred-to earlier,
however, Peps are by no means the most advantageous of UK investments
available.
Because of their status, their salaries - although typically exempt from UK
tax because of the 'foreign earnings' deduction (visits to the UK do not
exceed 62 consecutive days or one sixth of the overall period with more
generous limits for seafarers), will be regarded as 'net relevant earnings'.
Those who are not already members of UK approved pension schemes can,
therefore, pay UK personal pension contributions of between 17.5 per cent
and 35 per cent per annum according to age - although subject, since
1989/90, to an indexed ceiling on pensionable earnings. Somewhat
startlingly, such contributions attract a 25 per cent subsidy from the
taxman; for each Pounds 1,000 of gross premium, you have to pay only Pounds
750, the balance being met by the Treasury. That, you might think, is the
nearest the Inland Revenue will ever get to making you an offer you cannot
refuse.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where there's a will, there's a better
way - Scheherazade Daneshkhu lists the benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MANY people, writing a will is about as attractive as signing their own
death warrant. Some feel they have too little to leave and others cannot
bear thinking about who should get what. But many simply never get around to
what they consider a ghoulish task.
This probably explains why just under 70 per cent of the population does not
have a will, according to a recent survey by Gallup. But dying without one
can cause unnecessary hardship or hurt to family and friends. So, the Law
Society has designated next week as Write a Will Week.
Many married couples believe a spouse will inherit all of the other's
worldly goods. But under the intestacy rules in England and Wales, a spouse
gets only the first Pounds 75,000 of an estate; the rest is shared between
the spouse and the couple's children. If there are none, the spouse is
entitled to the first Pounds 125,000 and shares the rest with his or her
parents (the rules for Northern Ireland and Scotland are slightly
different).
A will also can be an important tax planning tool. While there is no
inheritance tax (IHT) when an estate is left to a spouse, there is the
danger of a higher IHT bill when they die. But married couples can make use
of their nil rate bands to save their children paying too much tax.
Mary Falk, a partner at law firm Farrer &amp; Co., suggests a simplified case in
which one spouse leaves Pounds 150,000 (his nil rate band for the present
tax year) to the children and the rest of his estate to his widow. If she
also makes use of her nil rate band in her will, there would be no IHT on
Pounds 300,000 of their joint estate.
A will does not have to be complicated but there are dangers in keeping it
too brief. John Tompkins, a chartered surveyor, describes how his uncle left
a will directing that everything he owned should be transferred to his wife,
who was 10 years younger.
The uncle was seriously ill in hospital when his wife, who had written a
detailed will, died of a heart attack. 'Because of his wife's sudden death,
none of her wishes, which included selling the family home and leaving the
proceeds in trust for a great-nephew, could be honoured,' says Tompkins.
A will usually has three sections: appointing executors, distributing the
property, and prescribing powers for the trustees.
Executors handle your affairs after you die. It is usual to appoint a
spouse, or the main beneficiary of the will, as executor but it is advisable
to have two executors to share the burden. But you should make sure first
that they are happy with the responsibility.
Professionals, such as solicitors or accountants, can be appointed but there
should be a clause to arrange payment of their fees. Those with children
should also think of whom to appoint as guardian.
Inheritors. Before deciding who should get what, list what there is to
leave. This will include your house, car, and valuable possessions such as
jewellery and investments. These should be described clearly.
It is advisable to name family members you wish to benefit. If you just say
'my children' and have step-children, there could be a problem of
interpretation.
Since you will probably be unable to divide up your estate down to the last
pence, you should also state who is to inherit what is left over - the
residue. If one of your beneficiaries dies before you make an amendment to
the will, their inheritance will be added to the residue.
Trustees can be given variable degrees of discretion over how much money
children should receive, and when. They own property legally for your
beneficiaries - usually children to the age of 18 - but cannot benefit from
that property themselves.
To draw up a will, you can go to a bank (which will insist on being an
executor) or will-writing service, but it is safest to consult a solicitor,
particularly if your estate is large or complicated. Which?, the Consumer's
Association* magazine, found in its latest survey that the cost of a simple
will drawn up by a solicitor was between Pounds 25-Pounds 50, with more
complicated wills starting at Pounds 100. Ask for an estimate in advance and
try to find a good solicitor through personal recommendation.
Mary Falk says there are several essentials to bear in mind:
The will must have at least three signatures to be valid - your own and that
of two witnesses.
They cannot be beneficiaries (if they are, their inheritance will be
invalidated).
Marriage revokes a will automatically (unless the person you are marrying is
mentioned specifically in it).
Divorce also produces complications. Your bequest to a former spouse can be
revoked by divorce, but not necessarily.
Review your will every five years - or sooner if your personal or financial
situation changes significantly.

and Inheriting (Consumers' Association and Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 9.99).

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Separate taxation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS THE change to separate taxation of husband and wife affected the
carrying forward of losses on share dealings to offset future capital gains
in excess of the capital gains allowance?
Can I now separate the capital losses of my wife and myself for past years
and set these against our separate future (hoped for) capital gains in
excess of the allowance?
Is there any time limit on carrying forward capital losses?
Yes - the former rule which enabled a husband to obtain CGT relief for his
wife's losses and vice versa (subject to the other spouse's tacit consent)
was abolished with effect from the end of 1989-90.
Allowable losses which accrued at any time in the past can be set against
current chargeable gains. Section 2(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains
Act 1992 says:
'Capital gains tax shall be charged on the total amount of chargeable gains
accruing to the person chargeable in the year of assessment, after deducting
(a) any allowable losses accruing to that person in that year of assessment,
and
(b) so far as they have not been allowed as a deduction from chargeable
gains accruing in any previous year of assessment, any allowable losses
accruing to that person in any previous year of assessment (not earlier than
the year 1965-66).'
There is no procedure for agreeing the amount of any allowable loss until
the year in which it is actually set against chargeable gains. All relevant
data and papers should, therefore, be retained.
The courts have confirmed that a tax inspector is not bound by any informal
agreement of allowable losses available to be carried forward.

for Married Couples.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Beneficial interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I have joint building society deposits, as well as shares and
other investments in our joint names. On the death of one party, does the
entire beneficial interest go to the other? This is obviously relevant for
succession planning and inheritance tax.
Barry Stillerman, of accountant Stoy Hayward, replies: You are correct in
stating that, in the case of joint building society accounts and other
investments in joint names, the assets pass entirely to the survivor on the
first death.
For inheritance tax purposes, if you want to pass certain of the assets to
parties other than your spouse - for example, your children - then it would
be necessary to separate the investments so that they are held by each of
you separately. This is similar to the situation regarding property where
many houses are held under a joint tenancy so that, if you want to gift your
half-share of the property, it would be necessary for the interest in the
property to be held as tenants-in-common rather than under joint ownership.
Thus, you can each deal with your half-share as you wish.

I RETIRED from the board of a company some two years ago and, since then, an
offshoot has been paying my BUPA subscription voluntarily. Is the
subscription taxable as a payment in kind?
On the bare facts outlined, the answer is that the amount paid to BUPA on
your behalf is assessable under Schedule E. It might well be that the paying
company will not get any corporation tax relief in respect of the amount in
question, since it does not appear to have made the payment for the purposes
of its trade.

<TEXT>
AS AN artist, I have accumulated a large number of paintings, with a value
of several thousand pounds. If I were to sell most of these via a public
exhibition or to a dealer, would the transaction be considered 'trading,'
and hence taxable, or merely as a sale of chattels?
A public exhibition would probably be regarded as an adventure in the nature
of trade. The question would then arise as to when (and at what value) the
paintings were appropriated to the trading activity.
The amount at stake probably justifies the expense of professional guidance
through the tax/VAT/NIC maze - from a local accountant for example -
particularly as, presumably, you do not plan to stop painting after the
sale.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Insurers adapt to different lives -
Changes in policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and PAUL NUKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE insurance is supposed to be about protecting your family in the event
of an untimely death. While this might seem obvious, the industry appears to
have forgotten it amid the proliferation of investment products it has
marketed heavily in the past few years. Endowments, single premium bonds and
personal pensions, for example, are all mainly investment products where
life cover is minimal.
Now, attitudes could be changing again, and customers are being offered a
range of useful protection products. Many could be worth looking at, since
this area has seen little development for some years.
Part of the problem is that early death does not seem as great a risk now as
it did in the 19th century when the UK's life insurance industry grew up and
the most simple form of life insurance evolved. This is 'term assurance' and
pays out a fixed sum to your dependents if you die within a set period.
This makes it a 'protection' or 'risk' policy. If you do not die within the
term of the policy, you receive no money, so there is no investment element.
Such insurance tends to be cheap, but is it also rather dated. Parents, even
with young children, very rarely go out of their way to buy it. A recent
survey for London Life found that 51 per cent of people do not know how much
life assurance they have, and only one in five has enough insurance to cover
between five and ten times their annual income.
In most cases, insurance is taken out because it has to be (as is the case
with the 46 per cent of those surveyed who took it out to cover a mortgage)
or because it is provided via a company pension scheme (which accounted for
47 per cent of those with cover).
Changes in society have created a demand for new angles on term assurance.
For example, DBS, the independent financial adviser network, has launched a
policy which allows divorced women to insure their husbands' lives. This
insures against the risk that their maintenance will be cut off if their
husband dies.
CE Heath, the broker, offers 'confidential life' which allows you to insure
another individual without their permission or knowledge. This is also aimed
at the divorced, but also at people in the entertainment industry, banks and
financial institutions, and the legal profession.
Improvements in medicine have created a demand for insurance which protects
you from the financial consequences of surviving a serious illness.
Life Benefit Resources will buy policies from people who are terminally ill.
The policyholders are offered an average of 69 per cent of the value of
their policy (up to a limit of 80 per cent), which they can then spend on
making their last days as happy as possible. It is of most obvious use to
those who are single, or without dependents.
In many ways this converts an 'old-fashioned' life policy into another new
breed of insurance, usually referred to as 'dread disease' or 'critical
illness'. These pay out on death, or when you contract one of a set list of
life-threatening illnesses. Therefore it can also pay for the costs of
recuperation, time spent off work, or a stay in a hospice. In many ways
these contracts seem more relevant to the problems of today, but
underwriters are still 'feeling their way', and the differences in the
precise illnesses covered make shopping around for the best-priced policy
more difficult.
Another form of protection, slightly further removed from traditional life
insurance, is the oddly named 'permanent health insurance'. This might
better be described as 'sick pay insurance' or 'income replacement'. Such a
policy will protect you against the risk of losing income through not being
fit enough to work. Such protection is especially important for the
self-employed but should also be considered by employees who are not covered
by competitive company sick pay arrangements. The underwriting skills needed
for this are very different from straightforward life insurance. But
traditional insurers have not been able to ignore such policies. The latest
entrant to the market is Standard Life, the UK's biggest mutual life
insurer.
Standard Life has built its reputation on investment performance. Now it
will join forces with US-based disability insurer UNUM. They aim to spark
life into the stagnant permanent health insurance (PHI) market.
Following the launch three weeks ago of a mortgage-linked critical illness
policy by Scottish Amicable, this is the strongest sign yet of a shift in
consumer demand, brought on by the recession, away from
investment-orientated products to policies that provide security and
protection.
The launch of the new policy, planned for November 16, will coincide with
improvements across Standard Life's range of protection-based policies,
including the introduction of non-smoker rates on its life term assurance.
This also shows an attempt to compete on the price of protection, rather
than on investment performance.
However, the decision to team up with UNUM could prove controversial. Since
UNUM's arrival in the UK two years ago, it has gained a reputation as a
hardnosed underwriter which takes a tough line on claims.
Its sophisticated system of 'claims management' incorporates a team of
counsellors who visit claimants' homes in an attempt to speed both their
recovery and return to work, and it has recently been involved in several
high profile disputes with claimants over benefits that have been refused or
withdrawn.
Standard Life said it had chosen UNUM because of its extensive experience in
the PHI market, adding that criticism of UNUM's claims handling was
exaggerated.
UNUM's role in the new venture will be to underwrite and administer the
product, which will be branded with the Standard Life name.
The basic design of the policy will follow an established format: it will
pay out 75 per cent of salary, minus state benefits, after claimants have
been off work for either 13 or 26 weeks, depending on the deferral period
selected at outset.
Perhaps most important, however, the definition of disability to be used to
determine the validity of claims will relate to the claimant's 'own'
occupation. Other plans require the claimant to be rendered incapable of
pursuing any occupation before they pay out.
If the policy proves successful, the way should be open for consumers to
find ways of protecting themselves cheaply, without taking on over-priced
investments on top.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pay plan pressure pays off - Prospects
of a better tax deal for employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S treatment of profit-related pay schemes seems likely to
improve after pressure from companies lobbying for change. The outlook has
brightened since August when an unexpected reversal of practice by the
Inland Revenue disqualified hundreds of recently approved schemes from
future tax relief for employees.
Led by Wellcome, a group of companies demanded a change in the law. It
expected a long struggle, but conciliatory remarks from government and
Revenue spokesmen late last month seemed to signal willingness to consider
even greater change than the lobby group is seeking.
Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, said at a privately organised
conference that he would be willing to listen to submissions on ways that
profit-related pay might be linked usefully with wider share ownership.
This was a departure from the government's previous insistence that
financial incentive schemes should offer either tax-free cash or shares but
not both.
At the same meeting, a Revenue official said the department would listen to
ideas on whether profit-related pay could be made more of an incentive.
Profit-related pay schemes were introduced in 1987 but have taken off as the
recession has worsened, growing from 1,277 to more than 3,000 in the past 18
months. About 760,000 employees in them can receive a pre-determined share
of the company's profits. This comes as tax-free pay capped at either 20 per
cent of salary or Pounds 4,000, whichever is lower.
Carol Arrowsmith, managing director of New Bridge Street Consultants - which
is co-ordinating the lobbying with Wellcome - said the schemes allowed
companies to hold wage costs in line with variations in profit, and to avoid
job cuts.
The problem centres on the way companies calculate the proportion of profits
to go into profit-related pay. The Revenue requires this to be set three
months in advance of the financial year and many companies, anxious not to
be committed to a simple percentage, have developed sophisticated formulae.
The Revenue clamped down in August when it became concerned that most
formula-based schemes were breaking substantially the link between pay and
profits. But the curb also hit companies trying genuinely to give
incentives.
'You cannot in future register a scheme with a formula, which means you
don't know at the start of the year what percentage of profits you will
share at the end,' said Arrowsmith. 'You can't increase the share of profit
paid out by reference to improved performance by the company.'
This was exactly the type of formula incorporated in Wellcome's
profit-related pay scheme, geared to rewarding improved corporate
performance rather than unchanged profits and approved by the Revenue after
long negotiations only weeks before the August clampdown.
Neville Machin, group employee relations manager at Wellcome, said he
believed the Revenue had acted after a warning from its lawyers that the
schemes they had been approving were out of line with the legislation. And
he added that if this was not a matter of interpretation, the law should be
changed.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: When it's time to get personal -
Planning Your Pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS of employees do not have access to a good company pension scheme.
The alternative, introduced in July 1988, is the personal pension. These
replaced the old-style, self-employed retirement annuities but - most
important - allowed individual employees to contract out of the state
earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). In return, they could get a rebate
of National Insurance (NI) contributions to invest in a plan of their
choice.
This used to be possible only through membership of an occupational scheme
which was contracted out. Where no company scheme operated, employees were
in Serps automatically. Today, almost 5m employees have personal pensions.
There are two component parts of a personal pension (although, for the sake
of convenience, providers tend to lump these together in one policy). The
appropriate personal pension is used to contract out of Serps, while a
top-up pension is used to take extra contributions above the contracted out
rebate.
Like all pension arrangements approved by the Inland Revenue, the personal
plan is an extremely tax-efficient way to save for retirement. Contributions
up to generous limits qualify for full tax relief, the pension fund itself
grows free of tax, and up to 25 per cent of the total fund at retirement can
be taken as tax-free cash.
The rest of the fund must be used to buy an annuity to provide the
retirement income. The pension can be drawn at any age between 50 and 75,
and these annuity payments are taxed as income.
Personal pensions do not provide a pension linked to final salary, as is the
case with most company schemes. Instead, the plans operate on a money
purchase basis. This means that your contributions are invested. The value
of the annuity you buy on retirement will depend on how well the fund has
performed and how much the provider has taken out by way of charges.
Almost anyone over the age of 16 can take out a personal pension provided
they have earned income. To understand how the personal pension works, it is
best to examine the plan in its two component parts.
'Appropriate' personal pensions
These are designed for three main categories of employees:
1. Those who do not have access to an occupational scheme.
2. Those whose company scheme is 'contracted in' to Serps (ie, where the
scheme benefits are paid in addition to the Serps pension).
3. Younger workers who expect to change jobs often and need a portable
pension. (The portability feature has drawbacks which will be discussed in
more detail next week).
If you are under 35 and in one of these categories, you should consider
contracting out of Serps with an appropriate personal pension. This is
because the value of the rebate is higher than the Serps' benefits you give
up.
These benefits do not build up at a flat rate but increase as you get older.
They also differ for men and women. The rebate is a flat rate and,
therefore, represents a better deal for younger employees. But the decision
to remain contracted out should be reassessed each year.
The rebate is calculated as a percentage of an employee's 'middle band
earnings' - ie, earnings between the lower and upper threshold for NI
contributions. For the present tax year, the NI thresholds are Pounds 2,808
and Pounds 21,060 per annum, giving middle band earnings of Pounds 18,252.
The rebate for the 1992/93 tax year is 8.47 per cent of these earnings,
giving a maximum of Pounds 1,546 to those who earn Pounds 21,060 or more
during this period. The 8.47 per cent includes a 2 per cent bonus to
encourage employees to opt out of Serps. The rebate is sent by the DSS
direct to your personal pension provider after the end of the tax year to
which it relates.
From April 1993, the rebate will be reduced to 4.8 per cent, plus an element
of tax relief. The 2 per cent bonus will stop, but employees age 30 and over
will still receive an extra 1 per cent.
There are restrictions on how the fund built up from the NI rebates - known
as the protected rights fund - can be used. It cannot be used to provide
tax-free cash and, in most cases, the pension must be taken at the same age
as the state pension, now 60 for women and 65 for men. The annuity bought
with the fund must provide for a 50 per cent spouse's pension, and the
annuity payments must increase by 3 per cent a year.
Many of these restrictions do not apply to the fund derived from
contributions paid in addition to the rebate. In particular, up to 25 per
cent of this fund can be taken as tax-free cash.
Top-up personal pensions
In addition to the rebate, employees can contribute a significant proportion
of their annual earnings into a personal pension. The limits are: Up to age
35: 17.5 per cent; 36-45: 20 per cent; 46-50: 25 per cent; 51-55: 30 per
cent; 56-60: 35 per cent; 61-74: 40 per cent.
It is possible to run more than one top-up personal pension plan provided
total contributions fall within these limits. But an employee can only have
one appropriate plan for each tax year.
Within the prescribed limits, employers can contribute to an individual
employee's plan, although there is no legal requirement to do so. Employees
in a company scheme who have earnings from a second source can also take out
a personal pension in respect of these earnings.
High earners with personal pensions are restricted by the 'earnings cap,'
introduced in the 1989 Budget, which limits the amount of salary that can be
taken into consideration for contributions. For the 1992/93 tax year the cap
is Pounds 75,000. It is also possible to use up to 5 per cent of the
contribution limit to pay for life assurance which, effectively, gives you
tax relief on the premiums.
A special provision exists for employees and the self-employed who have
unused tax relief in previous years. Under the Inland Revenue's 'carry back'
and 'carry forward' rules, it is possible to mop up unused relief for up to
seven previous tax years. This should be discussed with a tax expert.
Finally, personal pension plans can be used to accept a transfer value from
a preserved company pension although this is a complex issue and, again,
expert help is essential.
Personal pensions are available from a range of financial institutions but
the market is dominated by the life offices. A few unit trust groups and
friendly societies also offer personal pensions, while the banks and
building societies tend to sell life office plans.
Next week, we examine the different types of personal pensions available and
explain how your money is invested. We also examine providers' charges and
explain how to secure the best deals in terms of flexibility and
portability.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: CC&amp;P to transfer its Peps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CC&amp;P TRUSTEES, which manages personal equity plans, is giving is giving up
its corporate Pep business. The company, a subsidiary of Bacon &amp; Woodrow,
has written to its 35,000 Pep investors to tell them their plans will be
transferred. It is recommending to its corporate clients that they switch to
Henderson Financial Management.
CC&amp;P manages Peps for more than 40 companies including Marks &amp; Spencer,
Boots, Hanson and TSB and, along with brokers such as NatWest, Hoare Govett
and Cazenove, offered investors a low-cost, corporate Pep.
Investors with such Peps will have to pay more because of the transfer. CC&amp;P
had an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent but Henderson will be
charging 0.75.
The initial charge depends on the company in which the Pep investment is
made. In most cases, the companies paid this themselves; and as long as they
continue to do this with Henderson, investors should not see a difference in
the initial charge.

FT  10 OCT 92 / The Long View: When inflation gatecrashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION, they tell me, is yesterday's problem. It cannot possibly revive
in today's slump-time economy. I hope they are right; but I have seen
inflation reappear so often and so assertively as the answer, by default, to
Britain's stubborn problems, that I will need a lot of convincing.
Inflation does not need an invitation or an encouragement. It has to be
locked out firmly. No politician ever said in public that he or she wanted
higher inflation or a devaluation of the pound. Nor were they ever forecast
by the Treasury. A man from Mars might, therefore, be surprised that these
burdens could ever be visited upon us (although Essex man would not).
Here is a quote: 'To curb inflation remains our first priority.' Who said
it? It could have been the chancellor of the exchequer, Norman Lamont, at
the Conservative Party conference on Thursday but, actually, it was Anthony
Barber, then also chancellor, in the House of Commons on June 23 1972 - the
day that sterling was allowed to dive down out of the European Community's
original currency 'snake.' His next sentence gave the game away: 'We have
set our national economy on the path of a 5 per cent rate of expansion.'
As he spoke, the year-on-year inflation rate was 6 per cent. For comparison,
in the next three 12-month periods the rates were 9.7 per cent, 16.5 per
cent and 26.1 per cent. Some priority. These days there are, of course, no
fantasies about 5 per cent growth (although, in its more deranged moments,
the Treasury projects 3.5 per cent). But might not plain economic recovery
be a more powerful priority for politicians?
June 1972, when sterling was devalued by about 7 per cent, probably provides
the closest historical parallel to September 1992 when the depreciation was
rather larger. What Lamont actually said on Thursday was that his objective
remained 'to bring inflation down and hold it there.'
Whatever one's scepticism, there are strong reasons for believing that the
inflationary consequences will not be nearly as serious this time. Bill
Martin, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - whose economic forecasts have been much
more accurate than most and who, as one of the Liverpool Six, both
recommended and predicted sterling's exit from the ERM - sees inflation
holding at 3 per cent through 1994. He admits, though, that there is still
plenty of scope for things to go wrong.
But few, if any, of the leading economists ever predicted the scale of the
inflationary surges of 1974, 1980 and 1990. There were always reasons - wage
and price controls, or recession - for believing that the worst could never
happen. Dare I add that many of the best economists are employed by
bond-broking houses which have a strong commercial interest in playing down
fears about inflation?
It is true that there is a deep recession now, but it has been going on for
two years. During that period, unemployment has risen by 1.1m, real GDP has
contracted by 3 per cent, and money GDP has risen by just 7 per cent. But
average pay for those still in work has risen 14 per cent. When a labour
market operates like that, it is hard to see that inflation can be regarded
as dead, especially as the implied contraction in company profitability will
have to be reversed as soon as better conditions return.
In the middle of September, the outside world decided that the British
economy was worth about 15 per cent less than the British government
claimed. Such a devaluation implies a fall in real incomes in Britain. We
shall now see whether that will stick, or whether the average man will
attempt to maintain his real standard of living.
True, monetary growth has slowed recently: broad money growth has fallen to
about 6 per cent year-on-year. But a great deal of money has been created in
the past few years - enough to finance an inflationary surge should
conditions encourage it.
Foreigners already have been taught a harsh lesson for their foolishness in
believing that a British government might place a high priority on
safeguarding the external value of the UK currency. Historically, overseas
investors had to be mad to buy British government bonds as anything other
than a short-term punt. But soon after the UK entered the ERM, many
international investors decided that it might be different this time, and
they started to accumulate gilts within their broader European bond
portfolios.
Overseas investors bought close to Pounds 10bn net of gilts between the
beginning of 1991 and July this year; and although they dumped Pounds 1.2bn
in August, and no doubt some more in September (there are no figures yet),
they must now have lost the equivalent of a good Pounds 1bn on their
remaining holdings. Perhaps they asked for trouble. They could have bought
DM bonds but thought that sterling bonds, giving a slightly higher interest
rate, offered more scope; they actually outperformed in the early part of
the year.
But foreign investors now will conclude once again that, whenever the going
gets tough, the British government reneges on its obligations in real terms.
Indeed, there is a practical penalty in that the prospects for the UK being
able to borrow overseas through issues of sterling-denominated paper are now
bleak.
Meanwhile, Lamont chooses to emphasise a minor recovery in consumer
spending, and newspapers are exploring eagerly the possibility that lower
interest rates will trigger a recovery in house prices. This does not yet
feel like a post-inflationary society.
I close with another look back to that inflationary mid-summer 20 years ago.
The FT's leader column of June 24 observed that the government's
anti-inflation policy was unclear. 'Unless it acts quickly and decisively in
this field, the decision to float could turn out in the end to have done
more harm than good.' I feel much the same way.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Old Rover learns new Japanese tricks: Michael Smith joined
the production line at Longbridge, where the shop stewards act as
management, managers dress like workers and workers imitate the Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of 40 workers at Rover's Longbridge car assembly plant has gathered
apprehensively in a rest area. Their shop steward has called them to a
meeting and his manner - unsmiling and full of importance - tells them the
matter is serious.
Behind him, several managers sit in an office, pretending not to be
interested. The scene looks dreadfully familiar: Is this an issue that will
be stirred up from resentment to anger and then to . . .'Down tools, lads
and everybody out'?
This time, the managers are on the shop steward's side; or rather, the
steward has become a ringmaster enforcing discipline. Speaking slowly,
savouring every syllable, the steward says they are here to discuss the
smashing down of a door in the toilets the day before. 'That is extremely
dangerous; it is unacceptable behaviour. The trade union movement cannot
condone it. Anyone who is caught doing it will be sacked and could even be
taken to court and sued.'
Any questions? There are few. Most of the men are relieved that it was not
as serious as they feared. The meeting ends. The managers are pleased, and
no wonder; they could have conveyed the message themselves, but with less
effect.
In another part of the plant, the company is having difficulties on its
Rover 200 production line. It is only the second day of production for the
1993 model and the two employees connecting a hose to the radiator are
overstretched and sweating.
A year or two ago, the line would have stopped while management negotiated a
solution with the trade unions. But now every worker knows that this line
must keep moving, as the lines are even now moving in Japan, France,
Belgium, Germany and elsewhere in the UK.
'You are not too loaded at the moment,' a team leader says to a worker up
the line. 'Could you do it?' 'No problem,' he says with a speed that shows
he does not even consider calling the shop steward.
'Don't you mind?' I ask him. 'I could do without it but I wasn't exactly
stretched before. It'll stop me getting bored.' He goes on to explain how
Rover is doing everything it can to compete with the Japanese; if that means
he must become more flexible, like a Japanese worker, then so be it.
The two incidents are symbolic of an extraordinary change which has come
about at Rover as it throws off old habits to meet the competition from the
three Japanese companies with manufacturing plants in Britain: Nissan, Honda
and Toyota.
The new spirit of co-operation between bosses and workers was given form in
a Japanese-style New Deal, launched a year ago by the company and agreed
with unions in April. Workers were given greater job security and improved
conditions. Sick pay, for example, was improved to the level offered to
white collar workers. The workers agreed to be more flexible and to give
more commitment.
Ten to 15 years ago this plant was famous for industrial strife. Clashes
between Michael Edwardes, then chairman, and Derek 'Red Robbo' Robinson, the
Longbridge union convenor, who was eventually sacked, were headline news
week after week. In the worst year, 1977, 7 per cent of working days lost
were lost through disputes.
Last year the equivalent figure was 0.0001 per cent.
Industrial discipline at Rover is benefitting from the employment
legislation of the Thatcher years and from the recession which makes men
fear for their jobs. But there is more to the improvement than workers'
fears and tougher laws.
Taking lessons from the Japanese and in particular from Honda, which has a
20 per cent stake in the company, Rover has made a big effort to involve its
34,000 workers more in their jobs and in the company, to increase their
training, improve their work environment and to ask them what they think.
Every manager uses the word 'empowerment.'
Anyone who visits Longbridge will see that the word is not empty one. The
work areas are much cleaner than in a traditional British factory; any spilt
grease and oil is cleaned up quickly. There is little surplus stock.
Production lines are no longer just rows of people staffing machines; they
are adorned by notice boards each with a series of charts telling groups of
workers how well, or badly, they are doing.
Occasionally a group of 10 or 15 workers - now called 'associates' - can be
found huddled together discussing how to improve their own or the company's
performance.
Workers answer to a team leader whom they help to choose. He, or sometimes
she, wears the same uniform as the line workers, and so do the managers. At
Rover, the days of the 'men in grey suits' - as managers are sometimes
called in UK factories - are over.
If all this appears thoroughly Japanese, so does the enthusiasm of a
surprisingly large number of workers. Everywhere I went in the Longbridge
plants, I was accosted by people, particularly team leaders, who were
evangelical in explaining the new Rover and their part in it. Dave McDonald,
a worker in the power train plant where engines and gear boxes are made, is
typical.
He became deeply disillusioned with the 'terrible management' eight years
ago and resigned as a union shop steward. Since then, he says, the
management has become less confrontational and the atmosphere has been
transformed. Three years ago he became a team leader, in charge of 10
people.
Ordinary line workers tend to be less gushing than team leaders, but their
attitude is positive. 'I think the management understand now that everyone
on the shop floor is not a dummy,' says Barry Millward a Mini line worker.
'Before, we came to work to do a job and that was it. Now we are asked to
give more and we do.'
When I watched him and his three colleagues fit the inside panel, the
handles and the pocket on a Mini door, I could not see how their job had
changed. For their Pounds 240 or so gross pay a week, they must must do dull
and repetitive tasks.
True, they start the day with a five-minute team briefing, but then it seems
to be traditional line-fodder work. The four take one door each from every
other car. Each group of tasks takes three minutes - at top speed the 360
metre line of 160 men works on 160 cars a day.
One change is that workers try harder to keep the line going. Brian
Phillips, who has been at the company for 25 years, says that until a few
years ago he and his colleagues would have said nothing if they were running
out of, say, door handles. 'It wasn't our job. If the line stopped it did
not bother us. Now we know there is more at stake and, because we are more
involved, we will tell the team leader.'
By far the biggest change in the job results from Phillips' ingenuity. The
plastic sheet which the men secure to the door as their first task was his
invention. It stops water leaking to the bottom of the door and causing
rust. Previously several pieces of sticky tape were used but fitting them
took far longer.
The system was used on the Metro line but engineers had been unable to
perfect it for the Mini. Phillips did so in his garage at home. The result
is a saving of Pounds 100,000 a year to the company. Phillips was rewarded
by Rover's suggestion scheme with a Pounds 5,000 payment, which he shared
with his three colleagues.
At Rover, the cult of the team is paramount. Team leaders are a step above
the ordinary line worker but, according to the company, definitely not
'management narks.' They monitor the quality and productivity of the group,
and keep the team informed. Although elected by team members, potential
leaders have to pass tests and to be approved by the company. Sometimes the
elections are little more than a formality.
When Bob Edden became a team leader on the Rover 200 car production line he
was one of seven who stood for election; there were six places available. It
is not hard to see why the company wants him and people like him as leaders.
Edden, aged 39, left school at 15 and spent 20 years as a milk man. He is a
neat and precise man who loves to work with his hands; for years that
passion found expression in his hobbies of making model cars and Napoleonic
figurines.
He considered going to work at Longbridge, but backed off, largely because
of the company's industrial relations record. Two years ago he decided to
apply and a year later he was a team leader. The energies he once put into
model making are now diverted into car production. 'It is like a hobby,' he
says.
Edden and others like him are the beneficiaries of team working. There are
also potential losers, not least the trade unions. In the past, shop
stewards were the main conduits for communication within the company; the
team system threatens that role.
Neil McGreevy, plant convener for the TGWU general workers' union, admits
that the union fears that the team system will be used to marginalise the
unions. 'But team working is here whether we like it or not and our people
will learn to live with it. I think it may even be a plus for the company.'
The challenge for Rover is to persuade ordinary workers that they too have
an interest in improving quality and in talking and feeling the same way as
Brian Phillips. Rover's programme of change has concentrated on the team
leaders. Below them there is apathy and even hostility.
Dave has done the same job on the Mini production line for 12 years in spite
of numerous applications to move. 'I can do it with my eyes closed and it is
very boring,' he says. He sees no value in team briefing, doubts the company
will keep its promise to avoid compulsory redundancies and pours scorn on
the idea that all workers are improved equality. 'It is still them and us as
far as I am concerned.'
'You have to put your hand up to go to the toilet these days. It's like
being at school. In the old days, I admit, we did not work hard enough, but
now it has gone too far the other way.'
Peter, a 57-year-old worker in the paint shop with 33 years experience at
Rover, applauds the management's emphasis on quality. But he is angry that
he has to answer to team leaders who he considers inexperienced. 'It is all
the young ones who do not know what they are doing. And as for all that
stuff they put on the notice boards, they must be using forests of paper.'
Neither Dave nor Peter wants to return to days of strikes and stoppages, but
the agenda has changed. If Rover is to compete with the Japanese
manufacturers in the UK it must do far more than prevent industrial action.
To stand a chance of eroding the quality and productivity gap, it has to win
the commitment of its workers. As one manager says: 'We've come a long way
and the atmosphere at Longbridge has been transformed. But really we have
only just started.'

FT  10 OCT 92 / A party at war and peace with itself: Conservatives close
their conference with the prime minister's renewed commitment to economic
goals - Ivo Dawnay hears the voices of the Tories'noisy minority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VISUAL metaphor for what has been one of the least successfully
stage-managed Conservative conferences came even before the prime minister
had made his triumphant entrance yesterday.
Three times, the boisterous element in the Brighton centre attempted to loop
the hall with a 360-degree 'Mexican wave.' At first, delegates on three
sides of the hall rose and returned to their seats, only for the 'wave' to
dash against the stiff upper lips on the platform.
The second try penetrated the platform's back row as grandees such as Lord
Howe, dutifully, if improbably, embraced the spirit of the terraces.
At the final attempt, the whole cabinet - Lamont, Hurd et al - ditched the
last vestiges of their dignity and, arms raised like surrendering squaddies,
paid ritual obeisance to the populist tide on the conference floor.
Throughout the week, two observations on the modern Conservative party
became common currency around the hotel bars. The first - touched on by Mr
Major's claim that 'Labour and the Liberals are utterly irrelevant' - is
that the Tory conference now combines both the government and its
opposition.
At its high point during Lord Tebbit's peasants' revolt on Tuesday
afternoon, a good half of the packed conference hall looked ready to defy
the leadership, before Mr Douglas Hurd's headmasterly speech reminded them
where their duty lay.
The second observation, also alluded to by Mr Major in his speech yesterday,
is that what for Labour is a vice, for the Tories is a virtue.
It is only proper, this argument goes, that as Britain grows to resemble the
de facto one-party states of Japan and Italy, natural checks and balances
should emerge to force the party leadership to heed its grassroots.
Opinions differ as to how much that is true. As tempers have flared over
Europe and the exchange rate mechanism this week, veterans have recalled
similar fervour in the past over Rhodesia and capital punishment.
This week, it was the noisy minority, not the silent majority, that made its
presence most strongly felt. What is more, it demonstrated an articulacy and
range of opinion many claimed never to have witnessed before.
As ever, there was plenty of the traditional wishful, not to say sloppy,
thinking like the woman who argued both for a 5-point interest rate cut and
an independent Bank of England.
But others claimed that the economic debate showed an unprecedented degree
of sophistication, both in diagnosis and cure. One senior Fleet Street
economic commentator observed with genuine, if patronising, surprise: 'I
think it is the first time I have ever heard a delegate from the floor at a
Tory conference talking sensibly about monetary aggregates.'
Some party activists say the new economic literacy is a direct legacy of the
the Thatcher years - an evolution of the battles between 'wets' and 'dries'
on to the A-level curriculum of the relative merits of fixed and floating
exchange rates.
Others say that the battles over the economy are for the most part simply
the continuation of the Maastricht civil war by other means. But that is to
ignore the Conservatives' old constituency of small business people for whom
European issues are firmly secondary to the more pressing question of
interest rates.
But while the majority of Tory conferencegoers may still be loyalists of the
non-combative, envelope-stuffing tendency, the Brighton hall also
demonstrated the growing readiness of highly politicised younger party
members to have a go at the leadership.
While the bulk of those were Thatcherite, it was also notable that at fringe
meetings some of the louder heckling came from a newly vociferous
pro-Maastricht grouping.
The fractiousness of the 1992 Brighton conference owed much to the
vulnerability of a Conservative government in the depths of recession and
battered by the Black Wednesday debacle. But its message carried little real
comfort for Labour.
Labour's Blackpool conference was remarkable in its refusal to mourn a
fourth successive election defeat. But the overriding mood was contemplative
and a trifle bemused.
By contrast, the grand Conservative coalition of City slickers and
blue-rinsed matrons, tweedy fogies and snappy-suited yuppies was energised
by the heady, high-octane stimulus of proximity to politicians in power.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Battle joined against red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW drive for deregulation and a fresh attempt to find ways of encouraging
joint public and private-sector investment in the infrastructure were
promised yesterday in Mr John Major's speech.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is to spearhead an
offensive against the increasing weight of regulation imposed on business.
People must be able to feel confident about food safety and public-health
standards, the prime minister said; 'But when this reaches the point where
you may need 28 separate licences, certificates and registrations just to
start a business, then I say again: this sort of thing must stop.'
Deregulation has been a consistent Tory theme, but Mr Major's signal that a
relaxation of the Treasury rules on co-operation between public and
private-sector investment in public works such as roads was more unexpected.
'It's too easy, when spending is under pressure, to forget the long term, to
let the burden fall on the private sector alone,' he said.
'We must work with industry to see whether the public and private sectors
working together can do more to invest in our future.'
Mr Major was responsible for a relaxation of the 'Ryrie rules' when he was
chief secretary to the Treasury, but even that loosening of the arrangements
for combining public and private investment has not led to many joint
projects.
The Conservative party organisation is undergoing its most radical overhaul
since 1945, Mr Norman Fowler, party chairman, told conference yesterday,
Bethan Hutton writes.
A post-election review of the party's organisation started this year.
'This is a review that will lead to action, not a review which is a
substitute for action,' Mr Fowler said, but made no mention of demands from
within the party for a directly elected executive committee and chairman.
Mr Fowler said the party's Pounds 10m overdraft was 'deeply unsatisfactory'
and must be eliminated. 'I believe you want an organisation that lives
within its means.'
Suspicions that Central Office was spending wastefully have led to some
associations refusing to contribute to central funds.

FT  10 OCT 92 / MPs to get options in Sunday trade bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is likely to offer MPs a free vote on a range of options for
the reform of Sunday trading in England and Wales in a bill it hopes to
table before the end of the present parliamentary session.
The options are expected to range from full deregulation on the Scottish
model to a tightening of existing laws along the lines advocated by the Keep
Sunday Special campaign. A government statement is expected before
Christmas.
Once a package is agreed, the government would use the whips to attempt to
ensure that it becomes law.
Mr Peter Lloyd, home office minister, conceded yesterday that the proposed
strategy was not foolproof - it was possible that none of the choices would
command majority support and one contradictory and anomalous regime could be
exchanged for another.
He said the government was prepared to make 'an act of faith' in the belief
that MPs would be prepared to compromise in the interests of speeding
reform.
Employee protection measures were likely to be similar to those in the
defeated 1986 bill, including protection against terms of employment being
changed to require Sunday working, he said.
Mr Lloyd accepted that the present widely flouted regime was unlikely to be
replaced before 1994. The drafting of legislation must await a decision by
the European Court - expected in autumn or early next year  - on whether the
present law was overridden by the free-trade articles of the Treaty of Rome.
The announcement was welcomed by reform campaigners, whose proposals are
likely to form the basis of the options presented to MPs.
Mr Roger Boaden, director of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, said: 'It is
a tremendous victory for shoppers who will soon have the freedom to shop
when they want and for shop workers who will benefit from the protection the
government has promised.'
His views were echoed in part by the Consumers' Association, which praised
the government for committing itself to 'reform of this unholy shambles'.
It added: 'Hundreds of thousands of consumers have been voting with their
feet to legalise Sunday trading. Reform must mean an unrestricted claim to
one of the most basic rights - choice.'
The government has been committed to reform of the Sunday trading laws since
1987 but has been reluctant to legislate after its last attempt was defeated
by a Conservative backbench rebellion in 1986.
A private members' bill advocating reforms along the lines of proposals
drawn up by the Keep Sunday Special campaign is due to be debated in the
House of Commons early next year.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Gooda loss probe finds no dishonesty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT deficiencies and poor underwriting rather than dishonesty were at
the heart of the difficulties of the Gooda Walker syndicates, which produced
some of the worst losses ever suffered by Names at Lloyd's, a loss review
investigation by the London market has concluded.
The report - marked 'private and confidential' - was prepared by a team
chaired by Mr Kieran Poynter, a partner at Price Waterhouse, the accountancy
firm, and sent to Names yesterday.
Between 1988 and 1990, syndicates 164, 290, 298 and 299, managed by agencies
in the Gooda Walker group, lost more than Pounds 550m for about 4,000 Names
 -the individuals whose assets support the insurance market's capital base.
The syndicates specialised in catastrophe reinsurance, in which Lloyd's
syndicates and London market companies reinsured each other's exposures to
catastrophe risks.
The 1,500-page report says they were overwhelmed by disasters such as
Hurricane Hugo in September 1989 because underwriters 'failed to recognise'
the scale of the risks to which they were exposed. They were also caught out
by underwriters' 'willingness to run a high degree of risk for high profit'.
Risk was also concentrated among relatively few Names. Each Gooda syndicate
under review 'wrote a substantial volume of excess of loss spiral business
such that there was a high probability they would all be affected by the
same loss events'.
Matters were made worse because Gooda syndicates frequently reinsured each
other, while the Gooda members' agency placed many of 250 Names whose
affairs it handled on Gooda syndicates.
Moreover, 'deficiencies in the managing agency control environment'
contributed to losses. Managing agents failed to give members' agents and
Names all relevant information.
'In particular it seems that relevant information was available in November
1988 which (if passed on) may have caused Names to reconsider participating
in the 1989 year,' the report says.
'The members' agents failed to appreciate the high-risk nature of the Gooda
syndicates. 'This was summed up by Anthony Gooda's often quoted remark to
many new Names that 'We won't make you a fortune but we won't lose you one
either'.'
The report did not 'encounter any evidence of impropriety of a dishonest
nature' and it concludes that Lloyd's had properly administered the
regulatory requirements relating to Gooda. However, it says the affair
raises a number of regulatory issues that should be addressed by Lloyd's.
It says syndicate prospectuses were inadequate and suggests that too much of
Gooda Walker's reinsurance was placed inside Lloyd's.
The report echoes the findings of a wider-ranging investigation by Sir David
Walker this year when it argues that simply monitoring premium income is an
inadequate means of controlling the high-risk exposures of syndicates.
It also questions the use by Gooda Walker of time and distance policies, a
financial reinsurance that had the effect of improving its reported results.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Teachers may face merit-only pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY RISES in the future for some 400,000 school teachers in England and
Wales should depend entirely on performance, Mr John Patten, education
secretary, said yesterday.
In evidence to the School Teachers' Review Body, he proposed a wholesale
move to discretionary pay rises for all teachers, sweeping away automatic
increments and annual cost-of-living awards.
Mr Patten's proposals are a direct challenge to the pay review body, which
earlier in the year outlined a scheme to award bonuses rewarding
improvements in performance to schools, which would pass them on to
individual members of staff. The review body argued that that would go with
the grain of schools' existing management and culture.
Its view is robustly opposed by Mr Patten, who said that merit pay for
teachers should be decided by governors and not solely according to a
school's position in exam-based league tables or truancy and staying-on
rates.
Mr Patten also said that no new money should be required for the switch,
which could be funded out of existing resources. Performance-related pay
should not depend on receiving 'bolt-on' extra cash but should be taken from
the existing pay bill.
His submission calls for action to introduce performance-related pay as soon
as possible. Trials should begin next year and the new system be implemented
from 1995, when the new system for teachers' appraisal would be fully in
place.
Mr Patten's evidence produced an immediate response from the unions, most of
which oppose any form of performance-related pay.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NAS/UWT general secretary, said it was 'outrageous'. Mr
Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the
largest teaching union, said it was impossible to operate such a scheme
fairly.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, which has not set its face against performance-related pay, said
that extra money for the scheme was essential.
He added: 'Whatever scheme the government has in mind, it won't work without
the backing of the heads and deputy heads who must have to administer it.'

FT  10 OCT 92 / Major aims for 'lasting recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED commitment to providing low inflation and low taxation to make the
British economy strong came yesterday as Mr John Major insisted that his
government would not betray the trust placed in it at the election.
In a bleak passage, he acknowledged the personal hardship that many people
were facing during the recession with the loss of their jobs, businesses or
homes, and the frustration at how slowly the economy was recovering even
though there were some signs of improvement.
That was why the government was determined to find a way of bringing about
sustainable prosperity. 'I don't want a temporary cure, I want a lasting
recovery,' the prime minister said.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was singled out to be thanked for his
'courage' in bringing inflation down. The government's specific promise on
inflation was restated in the phrase: 'We must keep it down at the point
where it no longer interferes with the decisions that people and businesses
have to make in their daily lives.'
The prime minister brushed aside the difficulties of sterling's suspension
from the exchange rate mechanism, which was mentioned just once in his
59-minute speech, with the comment that last month the mechanism 'was no
longer the servant of Europe's prosperity'.
Instead, he concentrated on the way in which low inflation, together with
the lower exchange rate, provided a great opportunity for British business
and exports.
He underlined the government's pledge on keeping to its public-spending
targets and on having low taxes, not just for individuals but for companies:
'Those who build up new businesses must be confident they won't be stifled
by taxation'.
While there were regular bursts of applause in the economic passages in Mr
Major's speech, the intense emotional audience reaction was reserved for
other subjects - particularly the outpouring of feeling provoked by his
commitment never to 'let our distinctive British identity be lost in a
federal Europe'.
By contrast, the representatives listened silently and attentively to much
of Mr Major's argument that Britain could not 'pull up the drawbridge and
live in our own private yesterday', and the clapping then was polite rather
than heartfelt.
There was even some hissing when Mr Major mentioned Maastricht.
The speech was remarkable for its absence of attacks on Labour and the
Liberal Democrats to rouse the Tory faithful, but after a week that has
exposed deep Conservative divisions, Mr Major still played some populist
notes that saw his party united on traditional areas closest to its heart.
His comments on new rights against unlawful strikes in the public services;
on cracking down on crime; on action to deal with 'new age' travellers - 'If
'doing your own thing' means exploiting the social security system and
sponging off others, then I don't want to understand' - and a commitment to
'old-fashioned' school standards and teaching methods all produced loud
appreciation.
Representatives roared approval when he said that the plans to set up
'education associations' to run inner-city schools if local councils failed
would mean a further row with the educational establishment.
'I look forward to that,' he told them. 'It's a row worth having.'

FT  10 OCT 92 / Thames in row over TV film rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW over television film rights might lead to litigation between Thames
Television and Carlton Communications, which won in the tender for the
London weekday franchise.
Thames says Carlton has not offered enough for the rights to show several
hundred feature films in the London region. Thames, which loses the London
weekday franchise at the end of the year, intends to keep the rights and
show the films on Channel 5 if the new channel gets the go-ahead.
Thames leads the only consortium bidding for the Channel 5 licence, and the
Independent Television Commission will decide next month whether to award
it.
If Carlton does not obtain the rights, it may be unable to show films being
carried by the rest of the ITV network. Thames wants Pounds 20m for its
share of the rights, which are bought collectively on behalf of ITV. It is
believed that the Carlton bid is around Pounds 8m.
Carlton said yesterday: 'The films in question can only be played on Channel
3. There is no question of their being available for transmission on Channel
5 even if it is licensed by the ITC.'

FT  10 OCT 92 / Markets: The stock price fall may prove justified - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE Federal Reserve has finished cutting interest rates for the
foreseeable future, as a story in the Financial Times suggested yesterday,
then this week's nerve-wracking plunge in US stock prices may prove to have
been an entirely justified - not to mention welcome - correction in market
values.
Although the Dow staged a remarkable recovery from its 104-point drop on
Monday morning, the index ended the day down 22 points, the losses of the
past 6 1/2 days total nearly 120 points, or 3.6 per cent of the average's
value.
The Dow, as of midday yesterday, was actually below the 3,164 level at which
it started 1992. Given the economic and political fundamentals that have
framed much of this year's trading - weak growth rates, rising unemployment,
depressed consumer confidence, and the growing likelihood that a Republican
incumbent would lose the presidency - no one should be particularly
surprised at such a poor performance.
In some respects, the recent sharp declines in share prices can be
interpreted as the final surrender of investors' hopes for a decent economic
recovery this year. Anyone who had bought stocks in expectation of further
cuts in interest rates, an improvement on the meagre growth rates seen in
the first half, and a surge in corporate profits that should normally follow
a recession's end, should have been in the vanguard of the sellers this
week.
A word that cropped up several times in the aftermath of Monday's
extraordinary volatility was 'cleansing'. Unpleasant as it may sound, those
investors who were selling on Monday, and most of them were institutions,
not individuals, administered a much-needed enema to the market.
As Byron Wein, chief domestic strategist for Morgan Stanley, put it earlier
this week: 'The way the market turned around after losing so much ground in
the morning tells you the market has been cleansed. Everybody who wanted to
sell has done it.'
Some analysts even believe that the low-point reached at 11.30am on Monday
of just under 3,100 on the Dow could turn out to be an important new floor
for the market. While few suggest stocks are poised for some substantial
gains, even less think there is a need for further selling.
With next important economic data some weeks away, and the outcome of the
election outcome seeming more certain every day, investors' will be
switching their attention to corporate earnings, and the third quarter
reporting season which begins in earnest next week.
There are already signs that profits estimates for the rest of 1992, many
compiled in early summer when analysts began to put out cautiously upbeat
notices on earnings prospects based on evidence of an upswing in economic
activity during the Spring, may need revising. As David Shulman, senior
equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said a few days ago: 'It's back to
the drawing board for earning forecasts this year and next."
Motor industry analysts are probably scribbling furiously at their drawing
boards at this very moment, hastily revising their estimates for Ford, the
car maker. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
made for the company's planned sale of Dollars 1bn of preferred stock, Ford
disclosed that it expects to report a loss for the just-completed third
quarter, and that because of economic uncertainty in Europe and the
continued weakness in domestic markets, the red ink could spread into the
fourth quarter's books.
Although Ford also made positive noises about 1993 earnings, the market did
not like what it heard, and yesterday Ford shares dropped more than Dollars
3 to Dollars 34 1/2 in the first few hours of trading as investors factored
the new development into the company's stock price.
Borland International was another company that faced the wrath of
disappointed investors this week. The software group's shares fell 25 per
cent in two days after several analysts followed each other in downgrading
the stock because of what they believed were poor initial sales of Borland's
important new spreadsheet product, Quattro Pro for Windows.
Borland's share price, however, regained some of that lost ground after the
company said early sales of Quattro Pro were better than expected, and
protested strongly that analysts were passing judgment on the product too
early to draw any meaningful conclusions.
In a neat turn of phrase that will probably become popular with many other
companies who feel victimised by Wall Street, Borland claimed yesterday it
had been a victim of 'pack analysis.'

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Halifax launches new account
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society is launching a new investment account, Premium
Xtra, on Tuesday, offering better returns on deposits of Pounds 10,000 and
upwards combined with a reasonable degree of access: the right of one
withdrawal of up to Pounds 5000 each month, provided that at least Pounds
10,000 is left in the account. Premium Xtra pays 8.80 per cent gross (6.6
per cent net) on Pounds 10,000, rising by stages to 9.60 per cent gross
(7.20 per cent net) on balances of Pounds 100,000 and more.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Up and down the Misery Index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'Misery Index', which adds the unemployment rate, expressed in
percentage terms, to the rate of inflation, fell last year because of the
drop in inflation from 9 per cent in January to 4.5 per cent in December
1991. It has been on the increase this year because of a steady rise in
unemployment, from 9.2 per cent in January to 9.9 per cent in August.
However, falls in inflation since May have helped to keep it down in recent
months.

Homeowners will not be cheered by the news that house prices fell by 3.1 per
cent last month, according to the Halifax price index. This is more than
twice as large as the previous fall of 1.3 per cent in December 1991. The
graph shows a steady 7.4 per cent fall in the index over the year to
September. Details: Page 7, Section One

FT  10 OCT 92 / Markets: Financial services in the jungle - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JUNGLE of wild beasts and tangled growth: this is not the Amazon or even
your neighbour's back garden but the financial services sector according to
a survey published this week by Mintel, the market research group.
The paper, entitled Customer Service in Personal Finance, used the analogy
to describe the development of the financial services industry.
Banks and building societies, for example, are expanding into
non-traditional areas, sometimes in a manner detrimental to the core service
they are meant to provide. Nowadays, few banks and building societies are
there simply to give you an account for your savings or a loan to buy a
house.
Instead, they have become tied agents for insurance companies and the
commission earned from the sale of insurance and pensions is becoming an
increasingly important part of their business. Last year, for example,
Nationwide earned Pounds 125.5m in commission from the sale of products such
as endowment mortgages, house contents insurance and pensions.
These products are enthusiastically promoted. Most people will have received
plenty of junk mail from their bank or building society advertising a new
health insurance product or a pension. Some, such as Midland, invite their
wealthier customers to see the bank's financial adviser.
Yet the banks and building societies apparently find it too expensive to
write to their customers to let them know of a new account when it replaces
the one they are in.
While banks spend more of their time behaving like investment product
salesmen, investment houses are behaving more like banks in one area. But
they are at least making things simpler for the customer rather than selling
a more elaborate product.
This week, Fidelity Investments has made changes to its cash fund which will
make it very similar to a high interest savings account. Even the populist
name under which it is being marketed - Easy Access Cash Account - is
indistinguishable from those of a bank or building society savings account.
But the account offers taxpayers a significantly higher interest rate than
is available on most instant-access accounts because it is invested in
money-market instruments - short-term deposits of large banks. Money market
rates change daily but are usually around those of base rates, now 9 per
cent. Yesterday, for example, the fund was paying 9.3 per cent gross on
Pounds 1,000, which is 1 to 2 points higher than what is on offer from most
deposit takers.
The change that Fidelity has introduced is to seek approval from the
regulatory authorities to rebase the price of units in the fund to Pounds 1,
with the unit price remaining a stable Pounds 1. This is made possible
because there is no bid-offer spread on a cash trust - just one price for
the units.
So, instead of the investor having to work out what his units are worth,
Fidelity will add income in units of Pounds 1 every month. Income will still
accumulate on a daily basis but in a separate account.
The change will make it easily apparent to investors how much they have in
their account. If you hold 8,514.6 units, you know that you have Pounds
8,514.60.
The annual management charge is 0.5 per cent on the account but this is
deducted before the gross yield is paid out.
Withdrawing your money from the fund is similar to operating a postal
account. Customers are provided with withdrawal slips and cheques are sent
three or four days later. A telegraphic transfer facility is also available.
Another distinguishing feature of the Cash Fund is that it is the only cash
unit trust for which a chequebook is issued. You need to have a minimum of
Pounds 5,000 in the account to get the chequebook and a Bank of Scotland
Gold Mastercard. There is a drawback - the minimum sum for which you can
write a cheque is Pounds 250, but you can use this to pay off bills or large
purchases.
However, there is no facility for standing orders or direct debits. This,
taken with the chequebook restrictions means it cannot be a substitute for a
current account but it is a highly attractive alternative to a building
society high interest account.
Non-taxpayers may, nonetheless, find it easier to stick with their bank or
building society. These accounts have the advantage over cash unit trusts of
paying income gross without the need to reclaim tax. Cash unit trusts may
not pay income gross, although the investor can reclaim tax in the usual
manner.
The cash fund is covered by the Investors' Compensation Scheme, under which
the first Pounds 30,000 of an investment can be refunded, followed by 90 per
cent of the next Pounds 20,000. This is better than building society
compensation which is limited to 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000.
Simplifying the fund's pricing will make it more accessible and that must be
welcome in the tangled growth of the financial services jungle.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Markets: United score on the rebound - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the stranger sights for a fly on the wall at this week's results
presentations must have been that of City analysts and fund managers
quizzing Manchester United about its plans for spending on football players.
Apparently they have noticed some thin goal-scoring patches and are asking
about 'a major signing'. With other clubs paying as much as Pounds 3.6m for
a striker, forecasts for Manchester United's pre-tax profits this year
probably have a net Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.5m pencilled in for dealings in
players.
There was a time when transfer fees knocked United into substantial pre-tax
losses. But that was before the business was tuned for stock market
flotation in June last year.
This week's announcement of a Pounds 5.1m pre-tax profit in the year to July
31 contained several contrasts with those pre-flotation days. Turnover, at
Pounds 20.1m, had risen by 74 per cent in two years; operating profit was 2
1/2 times higher at Pounds 6.3m; interest received of Pounds 1.4m replaced a
Pounds 90,000 bill as the cash pile grew to Pounds 14.8m.
But until recently United's share price performance has been a big
disappointment. The flotation price of 385p, which the public baulked at,
was rapidly undermined as sub-underwriters and the financially strapped
Kevin Maxwell sold stock. This summer's sale of a 4 per cent stake, seized
by a bank from Nigel Burroughs, a former club director, added a late twist
to the shake-out.
After bottoming out at 261p in July, the shares have recovered to 293p -
with 11p added after this week's results. If you look at the company's
performance against the hotels and leisure sector, the turn in sentiment
dates back to May - the month when the Premier League signed a Pounds 304m
deal with BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster.
The conclusion is that the City is beginning to take Manchester United
seriously. If this is sustained, it will mark a breakthrough for football
clubs on the stock market.
Manchester United has joined an anything but elite band of quoted football
clubs. The other two are Tottenham Hotspur, which had its shares suspended
for 14 months until its future was secured by Alan Sugar, the consumer
electronics millionaire, and Terry Venables, the team's former coach; and
Millwall Holdings, whose USM-quoted share price is languishing at 3 1/4 p.
However, just as the shenanigans at Spurs cast a shadow over United's
flotation, the north London club's return to financial soundness has helped
to improve sentiment towards football.
And while Millwall's case looks dire - it lost money again last year - it is
more than 80 per cent of the way towards securing Pounds 15m to build a new
stadium. Like Tottenham, which diversified disastrously into clothing, it
has returned to its core by selling Tavern Leisure.
This confirms the trend towards football clubs making a commercial virtue of
their sport. According to the ICC business ratio report on football - used
by United to point up its market leadership - an elite group enjoyed a
healthy trading profit margin of more than 10 per cent in 1990-91.
Another reassuring move by United was to publish an independent Pounds 24m
valuation of its players, carried out by accountants Touche Ross. Although
this will not go on the balance sheet, Robin Launders, finance director,
pointed out that it was worth nearly 200p a share, on top of the 344p of
conventional net asset backing.
For football fans wishing to invest in their hobby, Manchester United at
293p offers an 8.2 per cent dividend yield, with growth prospects
underpinned by a forecast increase in earnings of about 10 per cent. At 85p,
Tottenham is trading on a much lower historic price-earnings ratio of 4.2,
compared with United's 10.6, but has yet to resume dividend payments.
Millwall's shares obviously represent a much higher risk. However, as with a
handful of clubs that have bond schemes, discounts on seats can be obtained
by paying Pounds 250 for a Lions Card.
In most cases, fans can now get a return on a financial investment in their
club, either through a dividend or through discounts - in addition, of
course, to the emotional bonds.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Markets: Do not buy a used forecast from this man - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE YEAR 2000 is less than 100 months away - or that, I am told, is the
latest treasury forecast,' said John Major yesterday.
He did well to display caution. In their present mood, most stock market
dealers would require a personal letter of authentication from Pope Gregory
before accepting such a treasury calculation.
Their misgivings about the treasury surfaced, in spectacular fashion, on
Monday, when the FT-SE 100 index dropped 103 points, its worst one-day fall
since the October 1987 crash. Then, London was reacting to Wall Street's
desperate dive; this time, it was displaying its misgivings about UK
government policy, and its worries about sharp falls in continental bourses.
The two concerns were linked, in investors' minds at any rate. The tension
between interest rates in Germany and the gathering recession both there and
in much of the rest of Europe had led to the currency turmoil which ejected
Britain from the ERM. Though in mid-September the stock market had welcomed
that departure - because it appeared to free the UK from the deflationary
cage into which ERM membership had locked - by last weekend investors had
grown increasingly worried about the policy which would replace that cage.
As the pound continued to fall, the fear was that a government adrift had
forfeited the opportunity to ease monetary policy significantly, and would
instead find itself having to defend a sterling parity around DM 2.40 almost
as fiercely as it had defended DM 2.95. That would rule out the possibility
of further interest rate cuts.
By the end of the week, much of this gloom had lifted. The FT-SE 100 index,
which closed on Monday at 2446.3, had recouped almost all those losses by
the end of the week, closing on Friday at 2,541.2. The credit for this
improvement was popularly given to the Chancellor, who addressed the
Conservative party conference on Thursday.
In fact, however, the lion's share of the credit should go to the
Chancellor's old bogey, the German Bundesbank. It became clear in the course
of the week that the Bundesbank's easing of monetary policy had been more
substantial than the grudging quarter-point cut in the Lombard rate extorted
from it on the weekend of Italy's devaluation in early September.
On Friday, Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, said that German
money supply growth could slow after November because of the economic
slowdown. In the past, the Bundesbank has usually cut rates rapidly once it
has decided that inflationary dangers have passed; if this comment is
preparing the ground for that shift, the markets have reason to rejoice.
Spurred on by these thoughts, sterling recovered, and so did the stock
market. The pound's low point on Monday was just under DM 2.37; by Friday
afternoon it was trading at over DM 2.51.
It was just as well that the Bundesbank had come to Norman Lamont's rescue,
for he did little to help his own cause. In a speech that the charitable
described as lack-lustre, he was unable to give his new policy much
backbone. A written statement went little further, though it did indicate a
significant, formal, retreat from John Major's earlier policy of aiming for
zero inflation.
The new range for 'underlying inflation' (excluding mortgage interest) is to
be 0 to 4 per cent, initially in the upper end of the band, later at the
level - presumably 2 per cent - achieved by Britain's industrial
competitors. On Friday, by happy coincidence, the underlying measure fell to
4 per cent, at the top of the Chancellor's new band.
Individual sectors of the stock market have reflected the swings of optimism
and pessimism about the future course of interest rates. Industries
sensitive to interest rates, such as banks and insurance companies,
benefited most from the escape from the ERM, then retraced some ground.
The chart shows a Warburg calculation of the price-earnings ratios of five
sectors in relation to their recent historic highs and lows. Some
traditional cyclical stocks such as builders or chemicals are priced well
above their lows. Some of the stocks which rely on consumer confidence,
badly dented by the currency turmoil of September and the recent wave of
redundancies, are doing less well: hotels and leisure are closer to the
bottom of their recent range, in p/e terms, as are transport stocks. One of
the traditional defensive sectors, health and household stocks, is in the
middle of its historic range, after the shares' relative under-performance
earlier this year.
Another defensive stock - Ranks Hovis McDougall, the baker - found itself
under attack on Monday, as Hanson made a Pounds 780m hostile takeover bid,
offering 220p a share in cash. After rejecting the bid on the grounds that
it lacked commercial logic, and was anyway too cheap, RHM's chairman held
'useful' talks with Lord Hanson. The share price, which rose 66p on Monday,
to 241p, subsequently went nowhere, closing the week at 242p. In 1988 RHM
fought off a bid offering 465p. Investors could be forgiven for putting
RHM's arithmetical ability in the same class as that of the treasury.
Another sufferer from arithmetical misfortune was Hongkong Land, which has
been bidding to take its 15 per cent stake in Trafalgar House to just under
30 per cent. Its aim is to muscle its way on to the board, then pressure the
company's management to find some way of unlocking the value of its
businesses.
Alas, so convincing did it make its overture sound that institutional
investors decided to stay along for the ride, preferring to hold on to their
shares and holding down the likely Hongkong Land stake to under 20 per cent.
Whether that is enough to give the Keswicks - who run Hongkong Land and its
sister company Jardine Matheson - the opportunity to change things at
Trafalgar House remains to be seen.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Bush sets the stage for series of bitter debates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush continued to impugn Governor Bill Clinton's patriotism
yesterday, setting the stage for what could be an acrimonious confrontation
as he tries to rescue his faltering re-election campaign in the first debate
between presidential candidates in St Louis tomorrow night.
Mr Bush insisted in a morning television interview that he was only
questioning his opponent's 'judgment' in helping to organise demonstrations
against the Vietnam war while a student at Oxford 23 years ago and in
visiting the Soviet Union at the same time. But he then implied that such
activities rendered suspect his opponent's fitness to be commander-in-chief.
Mr Clinton counter-attacked and said the president was in the grip of
'extreme rightwingers'. Senator Bill Bradley from New Jersey, a Rhodes
Scholar at Oxford a few years before Mr Clinton, accused Mr Bush of
practising the worst form of McCarthyism. The president said yesterday such
'red baiting' charges were 'ridiculous'.
The question for Sunday night is whether Mr Bush, whose campaign has been
digging into Mr Clinton's private life for months and who also has access to
confidential intelligence files, will brandish some concrete information
about the Democrat's activities a generation ago.
The president gave warning of his intent in an interview in which he said
the rule of politics this year is 'be ugly, be nasty, everything goes'.
This, in effect, concedes that he will lose the election if the remaining 24
days of the campaign remain focused on bread and butter issues, such as the
state of the economy.
If Mr Bush pulls a rabbit out of the hat, it will have to be a big one.
Polls suggest that the more intense the negative attacks on Mr Clinton's
character over the past 10 days, the greater his lead has grown. One such
survey, published yesterday by USA Today/CNN, had him up by 16 points, with
50 per cent, against 34 per cent for the president and 9 per cent for Mr
Ross Perot, also present at the debate.
Mr Bush has brought in some noted Republican 'hard men', such as Mr Roger
Ailes, the political consultant, to help prepare for the debate. Mr Clinton,
whose basic task is to talk about the economy, avoid serious errors and look
the part, has recruited the Washington lawyer who 'played' Mr Bush as part
of Mr Michael Dukakis's training four years ago.
For Mr Bush, this is make-or-break time. His best, probably only, hope is to
breach Mr Clinton's defences on Sunday, have vice-president Dan Quayle
follow up on Tuesday in his debate with Senator Al Gore, and ram home any
advantage in the final two debates.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK drew a cautious response from Brussels yesterday when it proposed a
series of options for loosening its links with the European Community.
Senior EC officials stressed that the long-awaited Danish white paper was
just a first step in a long process of negotiation between Denmark and her
11 partners on how to secure Danish ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Denmark made the proposals in an attempt to find a viable framework for its
relationship with the EC. These links have been put in jeopardy by Denmark's
rejection of the treaty in its June referendum.
The British government, which holds the EC presidency, took an optimistic
line yesterday on the Danish paper. The UK expressed confidence that the
Community would respond quickly to Danish concerns over Maastricht with a
declaration at the special summit in Birmingham next week committing the
twelve to decentralisation and protecting national identities.
Brussels, by contrast, is focusing more on the considerable legal and
political hurdles hampering resolution of the 'Danish problem'.
'It will be very difficult to get unanimous agreement among the 11 on what
we do for Denmark,' a Brussels diplomat said yesterday.
One of the eight white paper options likely to draw particular attention is
one under which Denmark could ratify the Maastricht treaty, subject to a
time limit. It could then withdraw if the EC develops in ways not compatible
with Danish interests.
Another option in the paper proposes introducing additional clauses to the
treaty. These would affect all 12 member states. The paper also proposes
giving Denmark a special status in the Community.
The EC's fundamental problem is that the treaty cannot come into force until
it has been ratified by all 12 member states.
For the moment, there is a consensus among Denmark's partners that there can
be no renegotiation of the treaty. Diplomats and legal experts in European
capitals are urgently examining wording which could accommodate the Danes
without amounting to an amendment of Maastricht which would require
re-ratification.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Checks on Boeing 747 engine links ordered by US authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSPECTIONS were ordered yesterday on 700 Boeing 747 jumbo jets following
the discovery of fatigue and corrosion cracks in engine fitments.
The airworthiness directive issued by the US Federal Aviation Authority
orders operators of Boeing 747 aircraft powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney or
Rolls-Royce engines to check the fuse pins and lugs connecting the engines
to the struts on the wings.
Boeing said the inspections could take place during routine maintenance and
would not require taking the aircraft out of service. The FAA order does not
apply to the 747s powered by General Electric CF6 engines, which number
about 200.
Accident investigators are studying whether possible faults in the fuse pins
or lugs could have contributed to the crash of the El Al 747 cargo aircraft
in Amsterdam on Sunday. The FAA said in its airworthiness directive there
was no evidence that fuse pin cracking was responsible for the Amsterdam
crash.
The FAA first ordered checks on 747 engine mounts in 1986 after the report
of a failure of a fuse pin. It also recommended the replacement, if
necessary, of older pins with a redesigned pin.
The regulatory authority issued a second directive in 1991 after a 2.55-inch
crack was discovered in one of the redesigned pins. Since then it said it
had received several reports of fatigue cracks at corrosion sites in the new
pins on aircraft equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney or Rolls-Royce engines.
The FAA said a recent fuse pin inspection had revealed a crack in a midspar
fitting lug, the fitment through which the pin penetrates. The cause of the
cracking had not yet been discovered.
It warned that fatigue cracks in fuse pins or lugs could cause failure in
the engine support structure if not repaired. It therefore ordered
inspections of older pins within 30 days and further inspections every 500
landings. For the redesigned type of fuse pin, initial inspection must now
be done after 5,000 landings instead of 7,500.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority said the FAA directive would also apply to
British registered carriers, adding that British Airways had completed its
checks.

Standard Chartered's Dollars 41m suit against Citibank in connection with
its Indian troubles is a reminder that it has developed quite a penchant for
litigation. It has already been awarded damages worth more than Pounds 250m
this year in suits against Price Waterhouse, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the
Australian company, GPI Leisure. Perhaps investors should start rating the
bank on the basis of its ability to plead in court, rather than its record
for getting into scrapes in the first place.

FT  10 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sea change in sentiment seems to have swept through the foreign exchanges.
The Federal Reserve's postponement of a rate cut and easier conditions in
the German money market have sparked a dollar rally, easing pressure in the
ERM. Perhaps the franc's survival should be no surprise, given there was
little economic need for a devaluation. But lesser currencies are not out of
the woods. The Irish punt and the Swedish krona have held up against the
D-Mark, but that leaves them looking overvalued against their trading
neighbours, Britain and Finland, which have both had substantial
devaluations.
Besides it is open to question whether the dollar has finally turned. There
is a risk of the market getting ahead of itself in the short term. The
Bundesbank may be slow to ease further and the Fed may yet cut rates in the
aftermath of the election. A Clinton victory might also provoke knee-jerk
dollar sales. Then again, a loose Democrat fiscal policy might provoke the
Fed to tighten later, producing a policy mix similar to the early Reagan
years. However, comparisons with the economic growth and strong dollar of
that time must be set against falling US asset prices and the Dollars
4,000bn Federal debt.

FT  10 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If institutional shareholder soundings are right - and no one last night was
claiming otherwise - Hongkong Land's tender offer for Trafalgar House has
been something of a damp squib. The expectation in the market is that,
combined with Land's existing 14.99 per cent stake, the Far Eastern raiders
may end up with little more than 15 per cent when the result is formally
announced on Monday morning.
It would be wrong, however, to see this as a ringing endorsement either of
Trafalgar's existing management or their strategy. Long-term holders have
suffered a series of disappointments in the past couple of years, but they
appear to have taken the not unreasonable view that they would have been
short-changed if they had sold out for 85p per share. Asset values are a
highly unreliable guide in current markets, but there seems every chance
that the events of the past few days can act as a catalyst for change.
It could be that the top team at Trafalgar has the last laugh by announcing
a Hanson-style extension of their contracts well into the next millennium.
The issue, though, is more whether the reshuffle when it comes is cosmetic,
or whether it will satisfy shareholders that the board has the vision to
manage an international construction and engineering group with an
increasing technological orientation. Investors will have to be patient but
they cannot afford to be passive. At some point, for example, they may have
to be prepared to support Land's nominations for directors.

FT  10 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: House prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
September's 3.1 per cent fall in house prices, as measured by the Halifax
index, cut the wealth of UK homeowners by some Pounds 30bn. Prices are now
7.5 per cent below the level of a year ago, which is hardly the stuff of
economic recovery. The re-imposition of stamp duty in August hardly provides
a convenient excuse for September's figure. House prices also fell in the
previous two months. While Black Wednesday's threat of 15 per cent base
rates can hardly have helped sentiment, there are deeper forces at work.
Houses are no longer expensive when compared to earnings. Yet there is still
an over-supply. About 70,000 repossessed properties are up for sale, and
housebuilders have 40,000 unsold homes. On the demand side there is said to
be a queue of first-time buyers, but they have absolutely no incentive to
act before the market stabilises. Unemployment is still rising and earnings
are only increasing slowly. Given its fiscal constraints, the government can
be of little practical help. Interest rate cuts only make mortgages more
affordable. They do not address the supply-demand imbalance directly.
That puts housebuilders in a real bind. Many need to sell stock and free up
cash, but in such a weak market that will mean further price cuts. Any who
hoped that there would be no further decline in the value of their land
banks may have to think again.

FT  10 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Indicators of doubt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a telling verdict on the chancellor's post-devaluation economic policy
that yesterday's retail price figures leave the market as much in the dark
as ever. At 4 per cent the underlying rate of inflation is only just within
the target range, which arguably creates no room for a further interest rate
cut. On the other hand, if Mr Lamont is in a cutting mood he could choose to
concentrate on the Halifax index, which shows house prices falling 'sharply'
to use his own phrase. Then again, sterling's strength could be grounds for
relaxation. It closed above DM2.51.
It is just possible that yesterday's Pounds 800m issue of short-dated gilts
could presage a base rate cut next week. Events have followed such a pattern
before. But it is more likely that the authorities will want to wait until
sterling has been stable for some time before rushing in. The new criteria
for monetary policy would have scarcely any credibility if they were
stretched to justify a rate cut so quickly after they had been announced. If
the chancellor were that desperate, he would surely have found an excuse to
cut before the Tory conference.
The equity market is thus probably right to have lowered its expectations.
But while it wrestles with domestic imponderables, it should not ignore
events overseas. D-Mark money rates may be softer, but there has been no US
rate cut; the election is looming; and Wall Street is looking vulnerable.

FT  10 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines as hopes of a
rate cut fade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices fell sharply yesterday on a report that the Federal Reserve
has no plans to cut interest rates in the near future, after another rise in
bond yields and a big fall in Ford, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.45 at 3,136.58.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 5.08 at
402.67, while the Amex composite gave up 2.16 at 364.85 and the Nasdaq
composite slipped 3.35 to 570.53. Turnover on the NYSE was 179m shares, and
declines outnumbered rises by two to one.
Hopes that the Fed would ease monetary policy, possibly in conjunction with
the Bundesbank in Germany, crumbled yesterday in the wake of a Financial
Times story in which a senior Fed official ruled out a rate cut before the
November 3 election.
The story sent bond prices tumbling, and pushed the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond back above 7.5 per cent.
Investors are also worried about the third-quarter reporting season, and
that the market's expectations for corporate earnings may be unreasonably
high.
Ford's share price dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 34 3/4 in turnover of
4.6m shares after the company disclosed in its prospectus for a Dollars 1bn
preferred stock offering that it may make a loss in the third and fourth
quarter because of economic uncertainty afflicting its European markets, and
continued stagnation in domestic sales.
The bad news from Ford hit the other two big motor stocks. Chrysler fell
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/8 and General Motors, which suffered from a
string of analysts' downgrades earlier in the week, dropped Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 29 1/8 .
AMR, parent group of American Airlines, fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 54 7/8
after the carrier announced it was abandoning the four-tiered fare structure
it introduced in April because of intense price competition among US
airlines. Concern that the price war will continue to cripple the industry
weighed on other airline stocks, with Delta dropping Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 55 1/4 , United Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 112 1/8 , and USAir Dollars
 1/2 to Dollars 11 7/8 .
Brilliance China, which owns a majority stake in China's largest mini-bus
manufacturer and is the first Chinese company to raise equity finance in the
US, made an impressive debut yesterday. The stock ended at Dollars 20 1/8 ,
a handsome premium on the issue price of Dollars 16.
Caesar's World fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 34 1/8 after the company warned
of lower first-quarter profits.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended moderately lower, but a lack of players in the market
due to the Thanksgiving three-day weekend limited the losses, dealers said.
'There's just no volume. A lot of traders left early. Everybody's going home
for turkey,' one trader said.
The 300 composite index closed down 18.73 points at 3,218.49, within half a
point of the day's low. Declines led advances 261 to 216. Volume was a slow
24.59m shares and transactions were valued at CDollars 286m.
Bramalea plunged CDollars 0.14 to CDollars 0.37, a new 52-week low. Trizec
Corp, which is Bramalea's major shareholder, had its class A shares drop
CDollars 0.25 to CDollars 3.65.

FT  10 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt ponders the prospects of
recovery - But German equities are in a transitional phase, writes David
Waller, as they wait for the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a grim third quarter for the German stock market. The DAX index
of the top thirty shares fell by 16 per cent; and while in sterling terms,
that represented a real gain, the devaluation effect only served to increase
the temptation for London institutions to take profits, encouraging prices
to sink further.
The market was driven down by a host of factors: among others, by turmoil in
the currency markets, by fears about the direction of interest rates, and by
a reassessment of the prospects for corporate earnings in general next year.
The worst performers were automotive, engineering and steel companies such
as MAN, the truck group, which lost 35 per cent in the three months, and
Thyssen, Mannesmann, Volkswagen and Daimler Benz, all of which lost 27 per
cent. The best were the banks, especially Dresdner Bank (the best performer
in the DAX with a mere 1 per cent drop over the quarter) and the two big
Bavarian banks, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Bayerische Hypobank. These three
outperformed the market by 16 to 18 per cent.
There is talk now of consolidation and potential recovery. The relationship
between yields on shares and government bonds has begun to make shares look
cheap, optimists argue. And after the Bundesbank's quarter-point cut in the
Lombard rate last month, they are hopeful that the direction of interest
rates will from now on be decisively downwards.
The trouble is that the market is still in a transitional phase. If it were
clear that the Bundesbank was about to embark on a cycle of interest rate
cuts to rival the halving of rates in previous recessionary phases
(1974-1976 and 1981-1983) then the market would recover robustly, driven by
the financials which account for a third of the DAX and could be expected to
do particularly well when interest rates were coming down.
But the Bundesbank's signals are conflicting. Money market rates are down
below 9 per cent - standing at 8.9 per cent yesterday, nearly a full
percentage point down from their level at the beginning of September.
Yet the Bundesbank appears to be taking pains to explain that M3 money
supply growth can be distorted. This could possibly be a preparation for the
time when they cut rates, without having achieved their target of keeping
monetary growth down to 3.5-5.5 per cent.
Alternatively, it could merely be that the Bundesbank is hinting that it
will not increase rates after what is likely to be a dreadful figure for
September M3 growth, due later this month. The figure, bloated by the impact
of intervention, could be as bad as 10 per cent.
Negative, from the market's point of view, is that Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
the Bundesbank president, and his colleagues on the central council have not
ceased to emphasise that the main target of policy is to squeeze inflation
out of the system. The current structure of interest rates leaves scope for
another quarter-point cut in the Lombard rate; but there is no indication
that Mr Schlesinger will present the markets, and the German economy, with a
full half-point cut by the end of the year.
This combination of factors leads to uncertainty, and encourages investors
to focus on the rapidly deteriorating fundamentals for the German economy.
It has long been taken for granted that the economy would benefit from a
surge of exports to the US and west European countries as they came out of
recession. But in recent weeks there has been a shift in perceptions.
Recovery in the US and elsewhere looks as far away as ever, and forecasts of
growth in Germany have had to be slashed in consequence.
The relative strengthening of the D-Mark in recent weeks has encouraged the
gloom, and Goldman Sachs, for example, has just cut its growth forecasts for
western German GDP growth for next year from 2-2.5 per cent to just 0.5 per
cent. The corollary of this is sharply reduced earnings expectations.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Frankfurt now expects earnings to grow by only 3
per cent next year, compared to a forecast of 11 per cent growth until the
Bundesbank raised rates in July.
So, argues Mr Jurgen Rothig of BZW, the market is going to move down
further, before it reaches a plateau at which it may start to look cheap
again. He expects the DAX index to go as low as 1,300, down from yesterday's
1,439.66, 11.46 lower on the day. Only then will investors be tempted back
into equities by what will be a 5 per cent gap between yields on equities
and on bunds, he says.
Mr Robert Willis at Hoare Govett in London is more optimistic - mainly
because he believes that the Bundesbank will not allow Germany to sink into
a fully-fledged recession and may, therefore, embark on 'possibly dramatic'
interest rate cuts in the course of next year. He acknowledges, though, that
investor confidence will recover only slowly, and predicts a drift in prices
before an significant recovery towards the turn of the year.
Hoare expects the banking sector to continue to outperform, both because the
sector's earnings should remain more resilient than in other sectors, and
because of the sector's high gearing to a fall in interest rates. Other
recommendations include BASF, the chemicals company whose share price, Mr
Willis argues, will be underpinned by a yield equating to the 7.5 per cent
on long Bunds, even if the 1992 dividend is cut to DM10 per share.

options-related selling

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SELL programs linked to yesterday's settlement of October options pushed
back share prices in the morning session but the Nikkei average managed to
close above the important 17,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index shed 275.73 to 17,059.78, down 1.5 per cent on the week.
After opening at the day's high of 17,275.13, heavy index-linked selling
pushed it to the day's low of 16,973.82.
Volume rose to 480m shares from 204m. Traders attributed the rise to
options-related activity, as some 300m shares were traded in the morning
session. Institutional investors remained on the sidelines.
Losers led gainers by 494 to 405, with 187 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.04 to 1,298.65 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.71 to 1,036.13.
Traders said that most of the share price movements during the past week
were either options-related or due to short-term trading by dealers and
individuals. 'There's no really long-term money coming in,' said one
analyst. He added that while some US pension funds were indicating buying
interest, European investors were small-lot sellers.
Speculators bought up plant engineers on prospects of new overseas projects,
but took their profits in the afternoon ahead of the weekend. Chiyoda fell
Y10 to Y1,920 and Toyo Engineering lost Y15 to Y950.
The dollar's strength against the yen helped some high-technology issues.
Sony gained Y20 to Y3,950 and Hitachi Y4 to Y749.
Sumitomo Chemical, the most active issue of the day, rose Y12 to Y471 on
reports of rising sales of its hepatitis treatment. Kikkoman, a soy sauce
maker, lost Y18 to Y967 on the recent decline in import prices of soyabeans,
due to the yen's appreciation.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 14.47 to 18,893.89 in volume of 15m shares.
Roundup
DOMESTIC issues worried the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG was boosted by reports that a Sino-US trade dispute could soon be
resolved and the Hang Seng Index rose 41.18 to 5,596.71, flat on the week.
Turnover was HKDollars 2.24bn, with some HKDollars 1.2bn coming in the last
30 minutes of trading.
Utilities were active with China Light and Power up HKDollars 1.25 to
HKDollars 33.50 on forecasts of good long-term growth.
SEOUL continued to advance with foreign buying seen in Pohang Iron and Steel
and Korea Electric Power. The composite index added 5.84 to 524.27 a gain of
2.1 per cent on the week. Turnover was Won134.8bn after Thursday's Won239bn.
TAIWAN fell 1.8 per cent on worries about the slowdown in the economy, some
brokers said. The weighted index fell 65.46 to 3,622.75, a 2.5 per cent fall
over the week. Turnover was TDollars 17.4bn.
MANILA, encouraged by reports that the IMF had approved the release of
Dollars 130m for the country's economic stabilisation programme, broke out
of the week's downward trend. The composite index gained 4.31 to 1,408.13,
down 1.4 per cent on the week. Combined turnover was 342m pesos after
Thursday's 299m pesos.
AUSTRALIA saw a lack of overseas buying and the All Ordinaries index
advanced just 0.7 to 1,466.2 in turnover of ADollars 189.4m, down 1.1 per
cent on the week.
Westpac was firmer on unsubstantiated rumours that Mr Kerry Packer may take
a 10 per cent stake, closing 5 cents higher at ADollars 2.84. Elsewhere,
News Corp slid 28 cents to ADollars 24.10 while BHP added 4 cents to
ADollars 11.68.
BANGKOK improved with banks featured among the day's most active stocks. The
SET index rose 2.98 to 886.34, up 0.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was
Bt16.4bn as declines led advances by 136 to 109. Krung Thai bank rose Bt2 to
Bt218.

FT  10 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Pirelli Tyre sheds 40% on plan
to double equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY the close of a turbulent week, most bourses had managed to recoup most of
the losses suffered on Monday, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM was surprised by Pirelli Tyre Holding's decision to double its
share capital. The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.7 at 107.8, a fall of 2
per cent on the week.
Pirelli closed down Fl 8.40 or nearly 40 per cent at Fl 12.70, following
news of its one-for-one rights issue, priced at Fl 10 per share and
underwritten by its parent, Pirelli SpA. The company said that the capital
was needed to fund its new restructuring programme, to help increase
profitability and improve efficiency. Last month the group forecast further
losses for 1992.
Rumours that KNP, the paper producer, might hold a press conference on
Monday at which it would announce a scaling back in 1992 forecasts saw the
shares down Fl 2.70 or 6.3 per cent at Fl 39.80.
Fokker, 90 cents lower at Fl 17.10, was again upset by reports, which it
later denied, that Dasa was not going ahead with plans to take a majority
stake. The rumours have been compounded by news earlier this week that Dasa
is cutting staff, one analyst said.
MILAN continued to advance, but dealers were divided about whether the
market was still in a technical rebound or whether the long-awaited recovery
had started. The Comit index rose 15.09 to 397.57, up 8.8 per cent on the
week, in turnover estimated at around Thursday's relatively heavy L195.6bn.
Fiat gained 5.8 per cent or L224 to L4,074 while Stet recouped another L85
to L1,285 and Italcementi added L295 or 4.1 per cent to L32,500. But Pirelli
fell L8 to L1,072 on news of its Dutch tyre unit's big capital increase.
PARIS lost early gains as Wall Street opened lower. The CAC-40 index fell
16.52 to 1,657.34, down 1.5 per cent on the week, in moderate turnover of
FFr1.9bn.
A denial from Havas that it had any interest in buying shares in Hachette
sent the latter's shares down by FFr22.70 or 14.3 per cent to FFr136 as
speculators sold out. Havas lost FFr8.80 to FFr369.20.
MADRID saw profit-taking ahead of the weekend. The general index rose 0.39
to 193.10, up 3.6 per cent on the week. Analysts said that September
inflation data due on Tuesday may interrupt this week's rally.
STOCKHOLM continued to be supported by lower domestic interest rates, as the
central bank cut its key lending rate to 16.5 per cent from 18 per cent. The
Affarsvarlden General index rose 14.9 to 668.0, but was 1.9 per cent lower
on the week, in turnover of SKr354m after SKr387m.
BRUSSELS closed mostly higher in spite of 5 per cent fall in Petrofina. The
Bel-20 index rose 5.6 to 1,094.87, steady on the week.
Petrofina tumbled BFr410 to BFr7,950, its lowest level this year, on news
that Norway might order the closing of a North Sea oil field oil and gas
processing tank in which Petrofina has a 30 per cent stake.
ZURICH featured chemicals again after Roche's forecast of a 'considerable
improvement' in 1992 group earnings on Thursday. The SMI index rose 8.1 to
1,878.4, a 0.5 per cent gain on the week. Roche certificates firmed SFr70 to
SFr3,620 while its bearers added SFr110 to SFr5,500.
COPENHAGEN's bank shares recovered as the result of rising bond prices,
writes Hilary Barnes. Danske Bank rose DKr9 to DKr229 and Unidanmark A by
DKr2 to DKr105. The all share index eased 0.25 to 255.10, down 4.3 per cent
on the week.

FT  10 OCT 92 / High hopes for Brussels trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC and US trade negotiators meet in Brussels tomorrow amid expectations that
they can bring off a deal on the Uruguay Round of trade talks, tempered by
the knowledge that, as one EC official put it, 'we have been here before'.
Hopes of concluding the nearly six-year-old world trade liberalisation talks
under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have
been dashed at too many previous 'breakthrough' negotiations for anyone to
be unreservedly optimistic now.
Officials from both sides argue that President George Bush is desperate to
get at least a headline deal on the Uruguay Round in time to lift his
declining chances of re-election on November 3.
For the EC, a deal offers a chance to shift attention from the crisis over
the Maastricht treaty. It would also defuse a dispute with the US over the
EC's oilseed subsidy regime that has threatened to explode into a
tit-for-tat trade war.
The Brussels talks were timed, one senior EC official says, to make it
possible for next Friday's emergency summit of EC heads of government in
Birmingham to set its seal on any agreement.
Mr Bush set out his hopes for a deal in a recent letter to Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission.
The EC and US have softened their positions on farm subsidies, the main
obstacle to a deal since the collapse of the Gatt summit in December 1990.
But both will have to cede still more, and then sell the result to their
Gatt partners.
The French government remains set against further concessions to the US,
after taking a beating from farmers in last month's referendum on Maastricht
and facing defeat in general elections next spring. Its raw new farm
minister, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, was sent to Brussels this week to block
any Gatt agreement which would damage French farmers' ability to export.
Technically, Paris cannot veto an agreement. But in the midst of the
Maastricht crisis, it remains to be seen whether France's partners would
risk isolating President Francois Mitterrand - much less whether German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl would risk damage to the Bonn-Paris axis which has
carried European integration forward.
The hope is that France is substituting gesture for substance, and will
record its hostility to an agreement without forcing an EC crisis over the
issue.
What is most agitating France - the EC's principal food exporter - is a
provision in the Uruguay Round draft 'final act', published last December,
to cut the volume of subsidised farm exports by 24 per cent, in addition to
a 36 per cent cut in the value of subsidised exports.
The second main EC-US difference is the extent to which payments to European
farmers in compensation for price cuts agreed in the Community's reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy will be exempt from a 20 per cent domestic
subsidy reduction, as called for by the draft 'final act'.
The last 'near miss' on these issues was July's Group of Seven summit in
Munich, at which Britain proposed the volume of subsidised food exports be
cut by 21 rather than 24 per cent.
However, EC farm commissioner Mr Ray MacSharry has pushed hard for
'aggregation' - allowing the EC to cut exports of sensitive farm products by
less than 24 per cent if it cuts deeply enough in less sensitive areas to
reach an average 24 per cent cut.
Mr MacSharry said in Dublin yesterday: 'It is absolutely clear that the
Community requires a certain level of flexibility' - but he is understood to
be willing to make this flexibility limited and detailed.
Mr MacSharry has also demanded that the EC's compensation payments under CAP
reform be indefinitely exempt from Gatt subsidy cuts.
If the agriculture impasse is unblocked in the next few days, it is still
uncertain whether separate Uruguay Round disputes on trade in services,
market access, and intellectual property rights can be resolved.
But then, if the farm dispute is not unblocked, negotiators may never find
out.
Mr Max Baucus, the influential chairman of the Senate international trade
subcommittee, has warned against a 'last-minute push to conclude the Uruguay
Round' for partisan political purposes, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington.
In a letter to Mrs Carla Hills, trade representative, Senator Baucus
complained about the politicisation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement and said a similar end-of-term push to get a Gatt deal would not
result in the 'best possible' agreement.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Brandt left indelible mark on post-war Europe: The life and
achievements of the former West German chancellor who has died at the age of
78
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WILLY BRANDT, the former West German chancellor who died on Thursday aged
78, belonged to that select band of post-war European leaders who stamped an
indelible mark not just on their countries, but across the European
continent.
His chancellorship, from 1969 to 1974, was relatively short. But his period
of uninterrupted influence on the centre stage of international politics was
longer than that of any other contemporary politician, in Germany or abroad.
In an almost kaleidoscopic variety of roles, ranging from charismatic young
mayor of Berlin to his latter years as elder statesman, Brandt gave shape
and direction to German politics during four post-war decades. In his last
years, before he was stricken by cancer in the spring, Brandt took up a new
part as an emotional force behind German unification.
The turbulence of his long life mirrored Germany's own vicissitudes. Brandt
was a man of varied hues and changing moods. His capacity for misjudgment
could sometimes be almost as striking as his qualities as an activist and
visionary.
Yet beyond all the restlessness which drove him on and the controversy which
dogged him, Brandt stood out as Germany's paramount statesman of peace.
After the horror and the shame of the second world war, he was the first
chancellor to allow foreigners - and his own compatriots - to believe again
in a decent Germany playing its part in the international community.
Brandt's career, moulded beneath the shadows of the Third Reich and maturing
during the cold war, was dedicated to ensuring that his country would never
again be a source of instability and evil. Through his Ostpolitik in the
early 1970s, normalising West Germany's relations with its neighbours in the
east, Brandt did more than any other politician before Mikhail Gorbachev to
bridge the post-1945 division of the continent.
His policies on eastern Europe were hotly contested at the time by the
German right as a sell-out to communism. But Brandt was a prime architect of
the detente which eventually, in 1990, made German unification possible.
In the 1970s and 1980s he occupied himself increasingly with international
affairs, as chairman of the International Socialists and of the Brandt
Commission. It was a source of frustration that the commission, despite all
its good intentions, failed to make any headway in closing the north-south
economic gap.
The sweeping aside of communism in East Germany in the autumn and winter of
1989 gave Brandt a pivotal new domestic role in a nation being reforged
before the eyes of an astonished world. At an age when many lesser men would
have settled into their armchairs, Brandt was out on the stump in both parts
of Germany, still fighting elections for his Social Democratic party (SPD),
still drawing the crowds with his peculiar brand of rasping oratory and his
message that the Fatherland was now 'growing together' again.
Brandt's political pinnacle came much earlier, during his five years as
chancellor - a period marking the return of the SPD as the main party in
government for the first time since the Weimar Republic of 1919-33.
His chancellorship ended abruptly, with his resignation over a spy affair -
still one of Germany's most opaque post-war political crises. He remained
SPD chairman until 1987, and was the party's honorary chairman until his
death.
Brandt showed a singular ability both to stir (his power to attract younger
women had a legendary, if not notorious, quality) and to disappoint. His
setbacks were almost as striking as his triumphs, and for all his undoubted
thoughtfulness he could teeter alarmingly between hesitancy and rashness. In
many ways he was the Hamlet of German politics.
Partly because he was so often going against the tide of contemporary ideas,
Brandt was an uncomfortable, often enigmatic figure. Respected rather than
loved by the Social Democratic party, he was not the first German leader to
owe part of his authority to his aloofness. Manoeuvring his way through
pitfalls along his political path, Brandt was all too often reminded that he
remained ultimately an outsider.
The central component of Brandt's Ostpolitik was recognition of East Germany
as a separate state. Although he clung to the nebulous goal of 'unity of the
nation' (a term he distinguished from 'reunification', which he rejected
because of its revanchiste overtones), he cajoled his countrymen to come to
terms with the legacy of Hitler. By accepting the status quo of division,
Brandt laid an important part of the groundwork for eventually ending it.
When the German black, red and gold flag was hoisted in Berlin in the
midnight Unity Day ceremony on October 3 1990, the 76-year-old Brandt was
there with the other dignatories on the balcony of the Reichstag, staring
out at the huge crowds with the inscrutability which, with age, he came to
wear like a mask.
In accepting the Nobel peace prize, awarded in 1971 for his Ostpolitik
breakthrough, he said: 'I believe in diversity, and hence in doubt.' So it
was an entirely typical paradox that unity took place after Brandt had given
up any idea of seeing it happen. 'Who would want to believe that, one day,
the German Democratic Republic would be annexed to the Federal Republic, and
that would be that?' he wrote in his memoirs, published in 1989.
The elliptical question was a favourite form of statement for a man who
could not take refuge in certainties.
His scepticism, like his self-doubt, had its origin in the complexities of
his childhood. He was born as Herbert Ernst Frahm on December 18 1913 in the
northern city of Lubeck, the illegitimate son of a 19-year-old shopgirl. He
never knew his father - a loss which helped shape his non-conformism and
concern for the under-privileged, as well as a sporadic lack of discipline.
He grew up under the guardianship of his 'grandfather' (a man who, in a
further twist, turned out not to have been the father of his mother). He
joined the SPD at the age of 16. Disenchanted with the Weimar Republic, and
supporting a more active struggle against the far right, he quit a year
later, in 1931, to join a splinter group, the Socialist Workers party.
This early defiance provides a key to his later tolerance, as party
chairman, of the radicalism of the Young Socialists during the 1970s, and
his attempted espousal of the cause of the Greens ecology party during the
1980s. Of the younger generation, he once said: 'They feel that the old and
middle-aged may already have made so many compromises that they can no
longer confront the new tasks of today.'
Shortly after Hitler took power in 1933, Brandt's splinter group, aware that
he was in danger of arrest by the Nazis, decided to send him to Oslo. He was
smuggled out of Germany on a fishing smack, taking with him the name of
Willy Brandt which he had already been using as a pen-name.
It was the start of 12 years of exile. During his three attempts to run for
the chancellorship during the 1960s, Brandt's political enemies tried to use
this emigration to show that he was less than totally committed to his
country. Indeed, Brandt's views on Germany often seemed strangely detached.
He once said that Chancellor Helmut Kohl - with whom he forged, in his later
years, a close political relationship, though never real friendship - would
be a better leader if he knew a little more about the world outside.
Brandt became a Socialist activist in Scandinavia, returning briefly to
Berlin on an undercover mission. As a journalist on the Republican side in
1937, he witnessed the horrors of the Spanish civil war. In 1940 he was
arrested by the invading German forces in Norway, while wearing a Norwegian
uniform. Interned and then released, he fled to neutral Sweden, where he
continued his underground work, took Norwegian citizenship and met his
future wife, Rut, who was Norwegian-born. (His marriage to his first wife,
Carlota, whom he met in 1940, broke down in 1944. After his marriage to Rut
also ended in divorce, Brandt wed in 1983 the journalist and author Brigitte
Seebacher.)
Brandt returned to his defeated homeland in 1945, as a correspondent
covering the Nuremberg trials. He found his way back to the SPD, but
remained a Norwegian citizen until 1948. In 1947 he became press attache at
the Norwegian military mission in Berlin. Shortly afterwards, he met Edzard
Reuter, the SPD governing mayor of West Berlin during the 1948-49 blockade,
who heavily influenced Brandt's firm anti-Communist policies in Berlin
during the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1949 Brandt was elected to the Bundestag as a West Berlin deputy, and in
1955 he became president of the West Berlin senate. In November 1956 he
twice showed his oratorical skills by stopping crowds of Berliners, angered
by Soviet crushing of the Hungarian revolution, from rushing into East
Berlin towards bloody confrontation with Russian tanks.
In 1957 Brandt was elected governing mayor of West Berlin. This was a
crucial period: the SPD, under the guidance of the party's irascible
strategist Herbert Wehner, was moving to cast off the encumbrances of
Marxist ideology and reform itself into a modern Volkspartei (people's
party).
Brandt's experience in 1961, when he witnessed the western allies'
helplessness as the Berlin Wall was built, had a profound effect on his
future foreign policy. The implication was clear: however important Bonn's
links with the US, Washington was incapable of giving West Germany full
protection against the Soviet Union. Through building up relations with the
East, Bonn would eventually have to take greater initiative for securing its
own security.
After three years as foreign minister in the Grand Coalition with the
Christian Democrats of 1966-69, Brandt had the chance to put his precepts
into effect when he became chancellor in 1970, in coalition with the Free
Democrats. His finest hour came when the coalition was returned with an
increased majority in the 1972 elections, making the SPD the largest single
party in the Bundestag.
By 1972, the high points of his crusading European policies - the emotional
visit to Erfurt in East Germany in 1970, and his dramatic gesture later that
year, when he knelt at the Warsaw monument to the Jewish ghetto - were past.
The victory bloom soon wilted. As he ran into obstacles with France over
policies towards western Europe, he became bogged down by domestic
difficulties, particularly an outbreak of public-sector strikes.
In April 1974, Gunter Guillaume, an official in the Chancellery who had been
sufficiently close to Brandt to have accompanied him on holiday to Norway,
was arrested on charges of spying for East Germany. Under pressure from
Wehner, still the main SPD power-broker, and disheartened by the reluctance
of others (notably Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then interior minister) to
shoulder any of the blame for the resulting debacle, Brandt impulsively
accepted complete responsibility. He resigned from office.
By staying on as SPD chairman, Brandt hoped to foster party unity. In fact,
the relationship gradually worsened with the other members of the SPD
leadership - the increasingly neurotic Wehner, and Helmut Schmidt. As
Schmidt became a target of SPD left-wingers opposing his course on defence,
nuclear energy and the economy, the chancellor accused Brandt of countering
party discipline by encouraging the cause of younger radicals.
After the SPD went into opposition in 1982, and lost two general elections
in 1983 and 1987, it became clear that Brandt himself had contributed to the
party's sense of drift. In March 1987 a somewhat mindless row brought his
downfall as party chairman. His attempt to hire as SPD press officer an able
political scientist - a young woman, Greek-born, above all a non-party
member - proved too daring for some party stalwarts. Badly piqued, the
patriarch (who would have bowed out anyway in 1988) announced that he was
stepping down.
In a emotional two-hour farewell address at Bonn's Beethoven Hall in June
1987, Brandt declared that his brand of libertarian social democracy was one
where the leader would make mistakes. 'I have not always considered what
should be considered. I am sorry. And that is it.'
Conditioned by the threat Germany had once posed to its neighbours and to
itself, Brandt spent his life looking several ways at once. His greatest
service was to show that a certain ambiguity could buttress Germany's
position in the world rather than undermine it. His greatest regret may have
been to have died before he - or anyone else - could be completely sure that
the unification of the German nation would turn out an unmitigated success.

<TEXT>
TRIBUTES poured in from all quarters for Mr Willy Brandt, the one-time
left-wing firebrand, rebel, refugee and illegitimate son of a northern
shopgirl, described yesterday as 'one of the great Germans of this century'.
Mr Brandt's death prompted warm tributes for his role in the rebuilding of
Germany after the second world war, his Nobel Peace Prize-winning efforts
through the policies of Ostpolitik to reconcile a divided Europe and his
humanitarian commitment to peace.
President George Bush, expressing deep sadness at Mr Brandt's death, said
the former West German chancellor was 'a towering figure of the post-war
era, a man of vision and courage'.
French President Francois Mitterrand, in a message of condolence to Mr
Richard von Weizsacker, his German counterpart, said: 'You have lost, we
have lost, one of our most eminent contemporary figures, as well as a man of
justice and peace.'
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, described Mr Brandt as 'a
passionate democrat and a lucid chancellor.'
Mr Brandt's political career as an exiled opponent of Adolf Hitler, mayor of
West Berlin and eventually chancellor of then West Germany won praise from
across the political spectrum of the country he lived to see reunified.
The warm words from rivals in Germany on the political right as well as from
the left showed that by the time he died on Thursday night, after months
suffering from intestinal cancer, he was regarded more as a father figure
than a political partisan.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who clearly welcomed his advice and the breadth of
his international experience, described him as a 'German patriot, European
and world citizen simultaneously. His word carried weight beyond party
boundaries.'
He paid tribute to him for his 'wise counsel,' particularly through the time
of German unification, when, Mr Kohl said: 'I could count on his support.
Even before the fall of the Berlin Wall he recognised that the chance was
there to overcome the division of Germany and Europe.'
The chancellor spent more than an hour at Mr Brandt's bedside only days
before he died, and yesterday had a long conversation of condolence with his
widow.
Ms Rita Sussmuth, president of the German parliament, read a eulogy to
Brandt at a saddened and hushed session. Flowers were laid on the seat he
had occupied in parliament.
German flags in front of parliament, across many cities and at the Social
Democratic party headquarters hung at half-mast.
Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West German foreign minister from 1974 to 1992,
said: 'Through him Germany won the confidence in the world that enabled it
to open up to the east without alienating its western partners.'
Lord (Denis) Healey, the former British Labour party minister and a close
friend of Mr Brandt, praised in particular 'his massive humanity'. He said:
'Many people will remember a photograph of him kneeling in contrition as the
German chancellor in the Warsaw ghetto, which was one of the great images of
post-war Europe.'
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, hailed Mr Brandt as a 'champion
of liberty'.
In Moscow, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, said the world
had lost 'an outstanding politician of our epoch' and a 'great democrat'.
Mr Brandt, who died at his home in Unkel outside Bonn, will be buried in
Berlin next week. President von Weizsacker has ordered a national
commemoration ceremony, the date for which remains to be fixed. A state
funeral will wait on the wishes of Mr Brandt's widow.

A RUSSIAN government audit has accused ex-Soviet president Mikhail
Gorbachev's non-profit foundation of illegally raking in hundreds of
thousands of dollars by subletting the premises Mr Gorbachev was allotted
last December.
Details of the audit report, published yesterday by the Moscow city
newspaper Kurant and confirmed by the Ministry of Finance, allege that the
Gorbachev Foundation, a non-profit think-tank, illegally earned Dollars
306,000 (Pounds 170,000) by leasing out its spacious premises, which include
an office complex, a villa outside Moscow and a sanatorium.
Coming on top of two court summons, the financial allegations could trigger
a witch-hunt aimed at the outspoken ex-president. In what appeared to be a
concerted effort to prepare the ground for further action against Mr
Gorbachev, Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, the Russian minister for information, said
Mr Gorbachev was seeking a 'Bolshevik-style' political comeback.
'When Gorbachev created the foundation and was given huge premises in Moscow
he said that he would gather brains to produce ideas for Russia,' Mr
Poltaranin said. 'Instead the foundation piled up hard currency.'
Mr Poltaranin said at a Confederation of Independent States meeting in
Bishkek: 'Gorbachev has set up a second Zurich, a Bolshevik centre from
which he watches to see how he can start firing the Aurora guns (which fired
the shots which sparked the Bolshevik revolution in 1917) at the present
authorities to launch another coup.'
The former Kremlin boss was unceremoniously evicted from the buildings in a
dawn raid on Thursday when Russian President Boris Yeltsin raised the stakes
in the increasingly acrimonious and petty battle between the two Russian
leaders.
Mr Gorbachev had previously been deprived of his limousines and has been
forbidden to travel abroad for refusing to answer the summons of Russia's
Constitutional Court.
Yesterday France formally complained to the Russian government about the
eviction, and the Italian government on Tuesday protested against the travel
ban. The newest allegations could spark more international anger.
The audit alleges that the foundation's hard-currency earnings, together
with big foreign donations, were used to furnish it with perks such as cars,
garages and foreign travel, subsidise ex-Communist newspapers, including
Pravda, and provide medical care abroad for one of Mr Gorbachev's
associates.
An official from the auditing department of the Russian Ministry of Finance
said investigations began in August. He insisted the audit was routine and
not politically motivated, and the Russian government was likely to decide
on its next move within a week.
However, he said Mr Yeltsin was directly involved in the investigation
through a special presidential auditing department.

ELECTIONS tomorrow in the former Soviet republic of Georgia are expected to
return Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, as head
of the republic's parliament - while an increasingly bitter civil war rages
in the northern autonomous republic of Abkhazia and the country descends
into chaos.
Mr Shevardnadze yesterday appealed to the United Nations Security Council,
in an open letter, to set up a war crimes commission to look into possible
atrocities being committed in Georgia by Abkhazian secessionists.
Meanwhile, Georgia's political leaders last night warned of terrorist
attacks in the capital of Tbilisi, aimed at stopping or destabilising the
elections.
In Sukhumi, the Abkhazian capital, refugees continued to besiege the airport
fleeing from the threat of an attack by Abkhazian forces.
The elections are contested by a plethora of parties, with the former
communist 'Peace' bloc in the lead, but with some 20 expected to take seats
in the Georgian legislature. Mr Shevardnadze is the sole candidate for the
post of parliamentary leader.
Mr Shevardnadze was due to meet Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and
Mr Vladislav Ardzimva, the Akbhazian leader, for talks on Tuesday on a naval
ship off Sukhumi.
However, the Russian news agency Itar-Tass yesterday reported that Mr
Shevardnadze was expressing last-minute reservations about the meeting.

<TEXT>
DENMARK'S white paper on its relationship with the European Community,
published yesterday, sketches several ways to solve the difficulties caused
by the No vote in its Maastricht referendum in June.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, warned that Denmark still
faces difficulties in trying to reach accord with the other EC members in a
way which will be palatable to the Danes.
However, he said he could see the outlines of a deal, which should be
feasible with a little goodwill.
The opposition Social Democratic party's spokesman on market affairs, Mr
Bjorn Westh, said he was satisfied with the white paper.
The 251-page document outlines eight options for Denmark and its EC
partners, although it steers clear of recommending which would be best for
Denmark.
The minority Conservative-Liberal coalition government and the other parties
in the Folketing (parliament) will try to hammer out an agreed position over
the coming weeks for presentation to the other countries in time for the
Edinburgh summit of the EC in December. The eight options are:
The Treaty of Rome is maintained as the basis for co-operation between the
member states and the problems which the Maastricht treaty aims to solve are
tackled another way.
The Maastricht treaty enters into force for the other 11 member states,
while Denmark joins the European Economic Area, under the agreement
concluded earlier this year between the EC and the members of the European
Free Trade Association.
The disadvantage for Denmark of this option is that Denmark would cease to
be a participant in the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, the white paper
points out, and Denmark receives more in direct support from the CAP - some
DKr1,728 (Pounds 186) per capita last year - than any other country except
Ireland. Denmark would also lose any influence over future EC policies.
Changes are made in the Maastricht treaty, effective for all 12
member-states. This option has already been ruled out by the other EC
countries.
The Maastricht treaty enters into force for the other 11 while in Denmark
the Rome treaty applies. The white paper concludes this would only be
possible if Denmark accepted the Maastricht treaty's amendments to the Rome
treaty.
'It is difficult to imagine that it would be practicable or legally feasible
to apply the new basis for co-operation (the Maastricht treaty) to some
states and the old basis (the Rome treaty) to others.' This option implies
that Denmark would cease to participate in the further process of European
integration, such as negotiations with applicant members or future
government conferences.
The 11 put the treaty into force and Denmark negotiates a special
arrangement. One objection to this is that it would involve a second
ratification process in many member countries.
Denmark agrees a limited ratification of the treaty, enabling it to withdraw
if it feels the Community is developing in ways not compatible with Danish
interests.
Riders to the Maastricht treaty are introduced which are effective for all
12 members. These riders could be given the legal form which seemed most
appropriate in each particular case.
The Maastricht treaty comes into force with special status for Denmark.
The two latter options come closest to the ideas that Danish politicians
have aired since the referendum, allowing Denmark some special opt-outs and,
for example, a text which spells out how some treaty obligations are to be
interpreted.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Bringing the mutineers aboard
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Danish white paper on Maastricht is an exercise in imprecision aimed at
reassuring domestic public opinion. Now comes the hard part: how to find a
solution acceptable to the Danes and their 11 EC partners which will bring
the mutineers back on board.
In Brussels yesterday, senior officials and diplomats were scouring the
white paper for hints on what precisely the Danes are demanding before they
submit the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum early next year. Few
underestimate the hurdles ahead.
'The outcome is by no means a foregone conclusion,' an EC ambassador said.
Items on the Danish list are easily identified: an assurance that Danes will
not be required to join a putative European army; an opt-out clause, similar
to the UK's, on a future European monetary union; assurances that Denmark's
high standards on the environment and social policy will not suffer in a
future European Union; and a general desire for more openness and less
centralisation in Community affairs.
The pessimistic view in Brussels is that the Danes will reach a political
consensus at home and falsely assume that this fact alone will be enough to
press their European partners into line - underestimating the huge task of
reaching unanimity among the 11.
Another fear is that the Danes will frame their demands in language which
amounts to a renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty - a position which all
11 agree is not possible (not least because no-one wants to endure a second
round of ratification battles on a modified Maastricht).
'It all comes down to the words,' said a senior European diplomat.
A more optimistic view is that the Danes will opt for self-restraint. This
would allow their partners to come up with a political declaration which
would seek to remove unfounded Danish fears. Such a declaration could, for
example, state clearly that 'there is no obligation - in legal terms - on
defence matters.'
Similar references to existing EC treaty law would probably suffice on
citizenship, the environment, and social policy, said a senior EC official.
However, an opt-out on monetary union, if pursued by the Danes and agreed by
the 11, would almost certainly need a treaty-amending protocol, says a
senior EC official.
In the end, it comes down to a political calculation: how much a moody 11
are prepared to forgive the upstart Danes in the interests of EC unity.
Next week's EC summit in Birmingham will offer the first clues.

FT  10 OCT 92 / 'EC will meet Danish concerns '
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government voiced confidence yesterday that the European
Community would respond quickly to Danish concerns over Maastricht with a
declaration committing the 12 to decentralisation and the protection of
national identities.
As the Copenhagen government set out the options to persuade its electorate
to reverse its rejection of Maastricht, senior British officials preparing
next week's Birmingham summit said the drafting of the statement planned by
EC leaders was now well advanced.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and current president of the council
of ministers, will discuss the text at a meeting later today with Mr Jacques
Delors, the Commission president. That will follow Mr Hurd's talks last
night with Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, and discussions
earlier this week with his Spanish and Portuguese counterparts.
The Bonn government has already indicated its strong support for the
statement and French President Francois Mitterrand has told British Prime
Minister John Major that it will receive French backing.
The officials said the declaration would provide the framework for
subsequent, more detailed, commitments this year to ensure that EC decisions
were based on the principle of subsidiarity.
The framework next week would include an outline of mechanisms for the
Council of Ministers to ensure that all Commission documents met the
principle of subsidiarity, rules to ensure national enforcement of agreed
directives, and examples of the areas where decision-making would be
returned to national governments from Brussels.
The Birmingham statement would also set out the basis on which the Community
could seek to allay fears that the concept of union citizenship enshrined in
Maastricht threatens national identities.
It would stress that EC citizenship was an adjunct rather than a substitute
for national citizenship and would emphasise the sovereignty of national
parliaments.
The British presidency expects the statement will give it a mandate to
prepare more formal texts which could be attached to the Maastricht treaty
at the Edinburgh summit in December. It acknowledges, however, that the
legal status of such documents at this stage remains uncertain and that
Denmark will also require further assurances over monetary union and defence
policy.

<TEXT>
A MEETING of ministers responsible for justice and law enforcement in all
the federal states of Germany yesterday broke up in disarray after they
failed to agree on measures to combat the wave of violence against
foreigners.
While conservatives demanded tougher police powers of arrest and detention,
and new curbs on the right of asylum, their Social Democrat opponents called
instead for the existing laws to be more rigorously enforced.
The result was a failure to agree on any common action, in spite of
unanimous agreement over the threat of violence against foreigners from
roaming gangs of skinheads chanting neo-Nazi slogans.
The meeting of justice and interior ministers from the 16 federal states, as
well as from the central government, was summoned in the wake of a series of
attacks on asylum-seekers hostels in east Germany since the summer.
In the end, the political differences over the cause of the violence - the
influx of asylum-seekers and would-be immigrants, mostly from eastern and
southern Europe - left the ministers too divided to muster a common front.
The ministers from conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) and Christian
Social Union (CSU) states, backed by Mr Rudolf Seiters, the federal interior
minister, were calling for wider powers of arrest and detention for the
police, a redefinition of the crime of breach of the public peace, and
reinforcement of the Federal Bureau for Protection of the Constitution, the
office responsible for internal state security.
They also sought agreement on constitutional changes to limit the flow of
asylum-seekers. Angry SPD ministers refused to go along with wider police
powers, insisting that what was needed was proper enforcement of existing
legislation, but also accusing their rivals of playing party politics.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Man in the News: Knocking on Chinese walls - Chris Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As John Major and Norman Lamont return home from this week's bruising
Conservative party conference they might spare a thought for Hong Kong,
where their former party chairman has emerged in good shape from a similarly
testing week.
On Wednesday, Mr Chris Patten, who in April lost his parliamentary seat and
shortly after was appointed the colony's 28th and last British governor,
presented a blueprint for Hong Kong's political development over the five
remaining years of UK rule. His plans to increase local participation in
politics drew a predictably sharp response from China, but in Hong Kong they
were well received.
Polls show his personal approval rating at nearly 70 per cent and approval
for his measures nearer to 80 per cent. Most astonishing of all, an
estimated 10m people in neighbouring Guangdong province on mainland China
watched Mr Patten's first public meeting, broadcast live on television in
English and Cantonese on Thursday evening.
What they, and the people of Hong Kong saw, was the governor explaining why
his proposals for greater democracy were necessary for Hong Kong's future
stability and prosperity. Of equal importance, they saw him take questions
from ordinary people about his plans for increased spending on health,
education and the environment. The governor answered candidly and with
humour.
Speaking in his office at Government House yesterday and flanked by
photographs of R A B Butler and Edward Boyle - two leading British
Conservative education secretaries - Mr Patten was in reflective mood. He
appeared conscious of the historical significance of his task, clear in his
aims and alert to the risks of failure.
'I'm aware that a lot of people are going to see a good deal of our colonial
history through the prism of how we manage things in Hong Kong,' he said.
'So I'd like in 1997 to have been thought to have done that job honourably
and honestly.'
When Mr Patten arrived in Hong Kong in July he brought a tradition of
Westminster democracy unknown to the people of Hong Kong. His penchant for
chatting to people on the streets - engaging in, as he says, 'a little
retail therapy' - has paid handsome dividends.
But there is a political point to this open and accessible style of
leadership. Together with answering questions in the legislative council,
the colony's foremost law-making institution, which he hopes will be a
permanent feature of his governorship, this openness is his way of
demonstrating that accountability can produce better government. This
accountability acts, he hopes, as a counterweight to the legitimacy he lacks
as an unelected political leader.
'I believe that the people of Hong Kong have to be consulted about their
future political developments, not just diplomats in London and Peking,' he
says.
Despite full backing from London for his plans, Mr Patten faces a daunting
task in trying to win China's acquiescence. He must convince Beijing that
his proposals are in its interests.
He has therefore challenged China to make alternative proposals capable of
winning the support of Hong Kong's people. At the same time Mr Patten will
remind China that whatever plans he finally agrees have to win the support
of the legislature.
But what if Mr Patten fails, as some political commentators in the colony
predict, to convince China that his course of action is best for Beijing and
Hong Kong? Mr Patten's response borders on a call for 'unilateral action' -
possibly pressing ahead with the blueprint without China's approval.
'We may have to agree to differ,' he says. 'I remain solidly of the view
that we can demonstrate in Hong Kong, between now and 1997, that our
governing institutions work effectively, and I don't think people change
things that work effectively. I remain very confident about that.
'The notion that preventing people moving modestly forward towards their
political aspirations is the right way of promoting political stability,
whereas trying in a reasonable way to accommodate those modest ambitions
does the reverse is, in my judgment, and I would have thought the judgment
of history, preposterous.'
Mr Patten is equally robust in his defence of the rule of law. It is almost
more important than anything else in the colony, he says, mindful of the
deep-seated fear among the people of Hong Kong that come 1997 corruption
could engulf the colony as it has in China.
'It's the rule of law and a pretty competent and clean government which have
been part of the mix (of Hong Kong society) that has produced this economic
miracle. I've got no doubt about that. The stability, the certainty, the
security which the law provides is absolutely key.'
Mr Patten's plans for Hong Kong have been described by local commentators as
'bold' and 'forthright'. Yet these adjectives could soon give way to
'over-optimistic' and 'foolhardy' if China wages a campaign to undermine and
discredit the Patten blueprint. The stakes are high.
He is wise enough to recognise this, and brave enough to speak candidly of
the consequences. He has a clear idea - based on his own ambitious
definition of success - of what constitutes failure.
It is 'above all, being thought not to have recognised our moral as well as
political responsibility for the way of life of the people of Hong Kong.
'But it would also be failure if I wasn't able to persuade China that Hong
Kong is mature, sophisticated, modest in its political ambitions and capable
of doing a lot more to look after its own affairs.
'I would have failed if I hadn't been able to persuade China that politics
in a free society is no threat; I'd have failed if I wasn't able to convince
the people of Hong Kong to have the same sort of resilience and
self-confidence in the modestly democratic conduct of their own affairs
which they show every day in every financial and commercial market in the
world.
'That would be failure. But, I may well fail.'

FT  10 OCT 92 / We've walked this road before: Major and Lamont have
survived a rough week in Brighton despite a dearth of new policy directions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stumbling out of the wreckage, Mr John Major has wrapped himself in the
Union Jack. Thus protected from the chill blasts of party disunity he
proposes to stagger, then walk, hoping eventually to trot in the same
direction as he set himself when he became prime minister two years ago. If
you make the charitable assumption that his government will not fall flat on
its face again, you could persuade yourself that the aftershocks of Black
Wednesday will come to be seen as blips on a glorious rising graph
delineating the achievements of the post-Thatcher period of Conservative
rule.
That, at any rate, is the conclusion we are intended to draw from Mr Major's
address to the Conservative party conference in Brighton yesterday. The
prime minister's European and economic strategies were blown apart when
Britain was forced to leave the exchange rate mechanism on Wednesday
September 16. Bits and pieces of those same strategies have been waved aloft
at the conference every day this week. In his speech yesterday Mr John Major
signalled that he hopes to put them together - that nothing has changed.
The Maastricht treaty will be ratified. That has been loudly proclaimed.
Britain will re-enter the exchange rate mechanism, perhaps within a year.
That has been loudly disguised. The near-elimination of inflation will still
be the objective; there will be no dash for growth. That was intimated by
the chancellor on Thursday and emphasised with somewhat more courage by the
prime minister yesterday. Until further notice, the same chancellor will be
in charge. Nobody has much to say in public about that, although Mr Major
did slip an endorsement of Mr Norman Lamont into his speech.
This methodical reconstruction of the authority of his administration cannot
properly begin until there is an acceptance of the Maastricht treaty. By the
time it gets through - if it does - it may be a meaningless bit of paper,
many of its clauses neutralised by addenda designed to suit the Danes and
allay the fears expressed by doubters in both Germany and Britain.
The Danish bid, put in yesterday, takes Britain some way towards its
objectives. A German paper, now circulating, may take the process even
further. A sketchy plan to curb the powers of the European Commission is
emerging. All that is, however, beside the point. The fate of something more
than mere nations - namely the careers of Mr Major and his colleagues -
depends on Parliament swallowing the treaty. After yesterday, we are
supposed to rest assured that it will.
On Monday night ministers arriving in Brighton were distinctly nervous about
the prospects. No one could tell whether there would be an uncontainable
anti-Maastricht revolt. The government's business managers knew - and still
know - that getting the bill to ratify the treaty through the Commons will
at best be a lengthy and exhausting process, with no guarantee of success.
What they could not foresee was whether the anti-Europeans would gather
recruits from among the ideological innocents who make up the great centre
of the Conservative party.
The antis are a disparate gang, led by two stars in ermine, Lord Tebbit and
Lady Thatcher (she who, at Bruges in September 1988, so memorably denounced
European centralism). Some are merely narrow nationalists. Others are
anti-immigration fanatics; yet others the grandchildren of the old empire
loyalists, or Lord Salisbury's defenders of white Rhodesia. A few, such as
Mr John Biffen, are attractive and civilised advocates of a respectable
point of view, blessed with a sense of constitutional and parliamentary
history and possessed of a wide vision reaching from the Atlantic to the
Urals. Some, such as Mr William Cash, are unstoppable Euro-bores. The great
majority represent the least attractive aspects of modern conservatism.
It is to the credit of the government, and some of its own stars, that at
this week's fixture Maastricht United defeated Bruges City. The ermined
strikers overreached themselves. On Tuesday Lord Tebbit's carefully
rehearsed impersonation of Brutus roused the noisy minority and provided
good television. It was, however, an ego trip too far, and the majority in
the conference hall eventually came to realise it. They started to do so
after a passionate, and magnificent, speech by Mr Douglas Hurd. His
arguments appealed to reason, although, the way I recall it, he was saying
in his peroration that if you are against Maastricht you are for murdering
starving babies in Somalia. Perhaps he was not quite so shameless, but you
get the picture. When Mr Hurd expresses such passion in public, even the
Conservative party knows that something important is going on.
Mr Michael Heseltine played the conference with his customary skill. His
crescendos, his soft-voiced changes of pace, his good fortune in his
hecklers, his every pause struck home. It might have been the clincher - but
for a newspaper article written by Lady Thatcher. In it she denounced the
policies she had implemented when in government. Would this sway the force
of the debate away from Mr Major's team? It did not. It was as much of a
mistake as Lord Tebbit had made. When she entered the hall on Thursday
morning she was given a rousing welcome by a substantial minority of those
present, but many sat on their hands. She watched from the platform, a
slightly diminished figure, while a speaker from Cheltenham reminded her
that the elders of the party were not expected to rock the boat. Loud and
prolonged applause. It was Maastricht United's winning goal.
Yesterday Mr Major sought to take the cup. He threw in every rhetorical
device his platform personality will allow. 'You cannot bully Britain,' he
said, in what for him was a Churchillian growl. He would put the interests
of his country 'first - now and always', he insisted, in his version of a
Thatcher oratorio.
He did seek to explain, at some length, the simple proposition that Britain
cannot afford to stand outside the goings-on on the Continent. He made a
creditable attempt to educate his party workers. In my view - but then I
have always been a believer - he won the argument: Maastricht does represent
a turning away from a centralised Europe towards a congeries of sovereign
states, whose elected governments co-operate through a series of constantly
renegotiated intergovernmental agreements.
The ERM building block may be harder to put in place, even though it should
logically come next. It is several ifs away, so we cannot be sure. It could
become irrelevant if the meeting of European Community leaders in Birmingham
on Friday fails to agree on the principles for amendment of the treaty. But,
assuming that hurdle is passed, consider the other ifs. If the exchange rate
mechanism survives, and if signs of economic recovery are evident in
Britain, Mr Major's government, if it is still there, will apply to rejoin.
No minister is talking in quite that way. Most are content to let the
argument subside for a few months. But the instincts of a strong majority of
the cabinet lie in the ERM direction.
Never mind the conditions stipulated in writing, but not in public
utterance, by the chancellor on Thursday. They are as the Madrid conditions
for joining the ERM, imposed by Lady Thatcher. When the political time is
right, Mr Major and his then chancellor will surely declare that the Lamont
conditions have been met, execute an about-turn, and march back in.
But the conference, the wider public and, most particularly, the handful of
anti-ERM ministers could not safely be let into this open secret. One or two
of the latter threaten resignation rather than accept re-entry; as to the
Tory audience the few pro-ERM remarks made from the floor this week were
loudly shouted down. Mr Major barely mentioned the dreaded initials.
For the moment he has other preoccupations. His dogged effort to reconstruct
his pre-September 16 position might be blown away - strategy, chancellor and
all - unless voters and consequently the MPs behind him begin to believe
that there will be an end to the recession. At the same time the markets
must be convinced that the process will be carefully controlled. The prime
minister's real problem, more serious than the exhilarating debates of this
week, is that his admirable counter-inflationary drive is still costing more
in terms of growth foregone than his supporters, many of them small business
owners and employees, can be expected to bear for much longer. From his
speech yesterday you have to conclude that he is aware of the problem, but
rather less in possession of a solution than he was on September 15.
For the rest, he chose to repackage well-established themes in the language
of conference oratory. A little trade-union bashing here, a re-emphasis of
school and hospital opt-outs there, all spiced with a dash of anti-crime
platitudes. In some of this he seemed to lean rightwards, perhaps in harmony
with his adoption of the flag as a suitable dress in which to cross the
Channel. So he attacked progressive education (here I am with him all the
way), bureaucratic red tape (who could demur?), the Conservatives' last
reorganisation of local government (although he did not put it like that)
and, in an onslaught beneath the dignity of a prime minister, new-age
travellers. Given his audience this was all predictable and mostly harmless
stuff.
In sum, the strong likelihood is that Mr Major will indeed survive. Some
three weeks ago he was shattered, personally and politically. This week he
seemed to have recovered his nerve. A tinge of anger has crept into his
demeanour and even his voice. If he is not tripped up again - in Birmingham,
say, or in the Commons, or by a further long run of bad economic news - he
will in due course exercise that most potent of all symbols of prime
ministerial power and reshuffle his cabinet. He, and we, can never again
assume that what he says will happen will in fact take place, but a
significant proportion of his former stature is recoverable.
His own awareness of this was evident in his trumpeting of his April 9
election victory yesterday. His contemptuous one-sentence dismissal of the
opposition ('Labour and the Liberals are utterly irrelevant') indicates that
he knows well enough how strong a position he occupies simply by virtue of
the fact that he is a prime minister commanding a working majority at the
start of a term that could last another 4 1/2 years. He could be blown off
course again, but it would be folly to assume that he will be.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Pause for breath
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE most turbulent month on the foreign exchanges since the collapse
of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s, a
semblance of calm returned to the dealing floors this week. The D-Mark,
hitherto Europe's safe-haven currency, even managed to show fitful signs of
weakness not only against sterling and the lira, but against the dollar and
the yen as well.
It came not a moment too soon for Europe's political leaders, who are due to
meet at next Friday's summit in Birmingham. One of their urgent priorities
must be to find ways of reassuring a European electorate whose enthusiasm
for ever closer union has been sapped by everything from high unemployment
to growing doubts about the contents of the Maastricht treaty.
Yet the question remains. Is it the calm after the storm or the lull before
the next onslaught? Everything points to the latter, although it would take
a brave pundit to forecast when the onslaught will start again. All that has
happened since September 16, the fateful day on which sterling parted
company with the exchange rate mechanism, is that the more extreme tensions
within the system have found a temporary resolution.
With sterling and the lira out of the frame and the peseta realigned within
the system, the immediate friction has been reduced. The success of the
joint front presented by the French and Germans against the markets' assault
on the franc further stiffened the defences of what remained of the ERM.
Just to round off the picture, the markets had second thoughts on Thursday
about the likelihood of a cut in the discount rate in the US and decided
that the recent decline in money market rates in Germany might be an
indication of looser policy to come from the Bundesbank. A cut in the
Italian central bank's key rate lent strength to that happy speculation,
which resulted in short covering by traders in the dollar and a consequent
weakening in the D-Mark.
Policy gaps
But speculation it remains; and there is no shortage of German economists
who suspect that the Bundesbank will cut later rather than sooner. Meantime
the most striking feature of the outlook for the markets is the uncertainty
that surrounds the main actors in the drama. As the momentum of Governor
Bill Clinton's election campaign becomes more impressive, the gaps in his
economic policy proposals, most notably in relation to the budget deficit,
become more striking. There is ample scope for nervous eruptions as the
election approaches.
In Germany the real economy appears to be slowing fast, as the strength of
the D-Mark bites into the competitiveness of the tradeable goods sector. Yet
the inflationary pressures are greatest in the service sector of the
economy, which strengthens the hand of those on the Bundesbank council who
will want to delay the interest rate cuts that hold the key to keeping
predators away from the weaker currencies in the ERM.
Nerve-wracking
Forecasting the outcome of the Italian budgetary dilemma is a nerve-wracking
proposition. For its part, Britain's Conservative government faces a stormy
autumn as it embarks on the ratification process for Maastricht. The best
that can be said, after this week's Tory party conference, is that Mr Major
has come out of his corner fighting and that some of his ministers, most
notably the foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, have proved better advocates
for the European cause than some had expected.
Yet the real conundrum for the markets - and the prize, for the speculators
 -remains the franc. With growth running at around 2 per cent, a rate of
inflation lower than that of Germany and no strain evident on its current
account, France looked a much more credible candidate for support within the
ERM than Britain. But the cost of that support has been debilitating for the
reserves - and for the French banking system, which has been instructed by
the government not to raise lending rates, while deposit rates have soared.
This week, three-month Euro-currency interest rates stood at 12 1/4 per cent
for the franc, against comparable D-Mark rates of 8 3/4 per cent and
sterling rates only marginally higher than that. In effect, the asset side
of the French bank balance sheet is under firm state control while the
liability side is not - a recipe for increasing losses and, ultimately, if
short-term rates do not come down fast, a deterioration in French public
finances.
On the trading front France is vulnerable to the German economic slow-down,
while it has seen a marked loss of competitiveness against its two other
main trading partners, Britain and Italy, after their recent devaluations.
All this as next year's elections loom closer, thereby adding political
sensitivity to any interest rate rise in support of a besieged currency.
As long as French and German economic policies are on a divergent tack, the
hard core of the ERM is not out of the wood; and for the markets more
generally the breather looks temporary.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Chancellor scores inflation bull's-eye: Economists are
divided over when devaluation will upset his aim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS RARE these days for news on the economy to comfort Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor. But yesterday's announcement that underlying inflation had
conveniently dropped to the upper limit of his newly announced target of 1
per cent to 4 per cent must have prompted at least a small smile.
The retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments grew by 4 per
cent in the year to September, its lowest level for 4 1/2 years. The overall
index was unchanged at 3.6 per cent. Even better news for the chancellor is
that both measures are expected to continue falling - at least for the time
being.
While economists are united in their belief that inflation is on a downward
path, they are less certain about when sterling's recent devaluation will
spur an increase in the rate of price rises.
Mr David Walton, an economist at Goldman Sachs, says the outlook for
inflation is good because the devaluation was 'superimposed on an
extraordinarily favour-able base line for inflation'.
He argues that prices will not move sharply upwards in response to the
devaluation - as traditional models would suggest - because the economy is
still in recession. Mr Walton believes that without the devaluation,
inflation would have dropped below zero by 1994.
'Even after the devaluation shock, we expect retail price inflation to drop
to 2.5 per cent by the end of next year, and any pick-up thereafter might be
very modest,' he says.
Mr Peter Spencer at Kleinwort Benson is less sure. 'Although inflation will
continue to fall for the next 12 to 18 months, it will become a problem as
soon as the economy recovers. There are a lot of latent inflationary
pressures . . . most obviously the devaluation itself,' he says.
Technical factors will ensure that the headline RPI, which includes mortgage
interest payments, will continue to fall for the time being. Mortgage
interest payments have a weighting of almost a fifth of the overall index so
the recent reduction in base rates to 9 per cent - and any subsequent cuts -
will exert a significant downward influence on it as building societies and
banks reduce interest charged on mortgages.
Technical factors aside, weak consumer demand and rising unemployment should
ensure that the underlying rate of inflation - which excludes mortgage
interest payments - will also continue its downward path.
Growing joblessness will act as a barrier to consumer confidence, without
which a strong recovery on the high street cannot take place. Because of
that, retailers will attempt to absorb the cost of higher import prices -
other than for products where demand is exceptionally buoyant, such as
computer games - until they can be confident that passing the increases on
to consumers will not damage sales.
Professor Douglas Mc-Williams at the Confederation of British Industry says
that is already happening. BMW, the German car manufacturer, for example,
has not adjusted the price of its new eight-cylinder model that came on the
market two months ago.
Eventually, however, the devaluation will exert upward pressure on prices.
Mr Spencer says: 'We believe inflation will move above 4 per cent towards 5
per cent during 1994 and certainly during 1995. The chancellor has set an
extremely ambitious goal that will be difficult to meet even if he adopts a
very cautious approach to monetary policy.'
Higher import prices will have the most immediate impact on inflation as
manufacturers see the prices of raw materials increase.
That will be noticed as early as this month in the input price index for
materials and fuel. In August, input prices were falling at an annualised
rate of 1.9 per cent, but that trend is now likely to be checked, in spite
of slug-gish world economic conditions.
The output price index - which tracks the prices of goods as they leave
factories - will eventually follow, but manufacturers say they intend to
absorb the increases for the time being.
In the high street, price adjustment will be slower, with margins continuing
to take the strain. However, the RPI weights for food, drink and tobacco,
household goods and clothing and footwear add up to about 40 per cent of the
total index. High import penetration across those sectors would exert
pressure on the index.
In the longer term, higher inflation and expectations of higher inflation
will exert upward pressure on average earnings as employees attempt to
protect the value of their real wages. However, as long as unemployment is
rising, workers will remain powerless to influence pay settlements.
A higher RPI may also, in the long run, raise prices through indexation.
Privatised utility prices, for example, are regulated according to a formula
using the RPI.
The last and most distant phase of the process would be when higher pay
deals lead to a further round of price rises and a wage-price spiral begins.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Suspended jail term for Manx bank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT KILLIN, 61, man-aging director of the collapsed Isle of Man
Savings and Investment Bank, received a 12-month suspended jail sentence
yesterday for conspiracy to defraud.
Judge Robert Hardy said his decision to suspend sentence in the case - which
resulted from a Pounds 550,000 fraudulent land deal - was because of the
length of the investigation and the trial at Manchester Crown Court.
The bank collapsed 10 years ago with Pounds 42m of depositors funds after a
series of risky, unsecured loans. Slack supervision by Manx authorities
allowed it to trade for 18 months while insolvent. Investigations on the
Isle of Man and in Britain took more than six years. Manx court cases
against the bank's principals collapsed in 1990 because of delays in
bringing charges.
Mr Robert Cunningham, general manager of the bank, was given a 12-month
suspended sentence last month. Sentencing of Mr Killin had been deferred.
Both had denied conspiracy to defraud in a four-month trial.
The fraud involved land at Baxenden, Lancashire, which was bought for Pounds
80,000 and sold the same day for Pounds 635,000 to Pennine Commercial
Holdings. The bankers were given shares afterwards and Mr Killin sold his
for more than Pounds 20,000.
The land had an inflated value because of a false valuation by a surveyor.
The Savings and Investment Bank provided the Pounds 80,000.
Mr David Knott, Pennine's managing director, also benefited from the illicit
profit of Pounds 550,000 on the Baxenden deal. He admitted conspiracy in
August 1989 and was jailed for six months with the balance of a two-year
term suspended.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Bloomfield avoids becoming bankrupt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL BLOOMFIELD, a prominent property trader with debts of nearly Pounds
60m, has avoided bankruptcy by agreeing a voluntary arrangement with
creditors. The agreement, under UK insolvency law, gives him five years to
repay 50p in every pound he owes.
Mr Bloomfield was the dealmaker behind some of the largest property
transactions of the 1980s, notably for Mountleigh, the property company that
is now in receivership. The deals included Paternoster Square, the former
Observer headquarters and plans to redevelop Battersea Power Station with Mr
John Broome.
Mr Bloomfield was a bankrupt for 20 years until the bankruptcy was annulled
in 1988.
Apart from personal assets of Pounds 500,000, his only source of funds to
repay his creditors are potential profits from deals enacted by his
companies. He can continue to be a director of more than 30 companies which
include Fort-lodge, his main vehicle, and Keatway, a company formed from the
restructuring of Benlox, the troubled building and engineering company.
A spokesman for Mr Bloomfield said he was confident that he would repay his
creditors in full. His proposed deals include Russian timber contracts and
an Pounds 895,000 acquisition of the Roundhouse in Camden, north London.
Mr Bloomfield's largest creditor is United Dutch Group, which claims that he
owes it Pounds 33.8m, although Mr Bloomfield says the debt is Pounds 28m. In
1990, United Dutch Group bought ICA Holdings, Mr Bloomfield's vehicle for
his attempted redevelopment of Battersea Power Station.
Mr Bloomfield also owes Pounds 7.5m to Lonrho's Observer subsidiary, Pounds
2.5m to Greenaway Harrison, a subsidiary of the Observer, and Pounds 100,000
to Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian financier. He has also given personal
guarantees of Pounds 7.2m to Credit Suisse and Pounds 6.5m to Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai bank.
The nine creditors have appointed Mr Richard Long of Robson Rhodes, the
accountancy firm, as supervisor to the five-year repayment programme. 'He is
adamant that everyone will be paid back,' Mr Long said.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Clothes prices lift RPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE increases for clothing and household goods as new stock entered the
shops and summer sales ended spurred the 0.4 per cent increase in the retail
prices index last month, compared with August.
In September, prices of clothes and shoes rose by 4 per cent on the previous
month, the biggest rise in the sector for any September since 1917. However,
on an annual basis prices continued to fall. They were 0.1 per cent lower
than a year ago.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that dearer leisure
services and a smaller-than-expected fall in seasonal food prices also
contributed to the rise in the retail prices index from 138.9 in August to
139.4 last month.
The CSO said seasonal food normally normally fall in September, but this
year's drop was not as sharp as last year's, which was exceptional.
Fresh fruit and potatoes were cheaper but there were price increases for
some other fresh vegetables. As a result, seasonal food prices fell by 9.5
per cent in the year to September, compared with a drop of 12 per cent in
the year to August.
Housing costs increased last month. The CSO said that reflected an increase
in the index for mortgage interest payments as the average outstanding
mortgage debt continued to rise. On an annual basis, housing costs rose from
3.7 per cent in August to 3.9 per cent last month.
The recent cut in base rates from 10 per cent to 9 per cent is not expected
to affect the headline rate of inflation until November. A reduction of 1
percentage point in mortgage interest rates might knock about 0.4 percentage
points off the all-items index.
Higher fees for evening education classes at the beginning of the academic
year pushed leisure services prices up by 2.2 per cent on the previous
month.
Lower prices for secondhand cars and cheaper petrol contributed to the 0.5
per cent fall in motoring expenditure last month.

FT  10 OCT 92 / House gloom deepens as prices fall by 3.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CRISIS in the housing market deepened last month, with UK house prices
falling on average by a record 3.1 per cent, Halifax, Britain's biggest
building society said yesterday.
The fall in prices was twice as large as any monthly drop since the society
began publishing its house-price index in 1983. It was the third successive
month in which prices fell.
Halifax blamed the sharp decline on a bunching of sales in August, as buyers
rushed to beat the deadline for the end of stamp duty concessions. It added
that concern about rising unemployment and the state of the economy was
continuing to sap confidence in spite of the reductions in mortgage interest
rates announced after sterling's withdrawal from the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The society said further cuts in interest rates were needed if confidence
was to be restored. Government measures to boost the housing market would
also be welcome.
The figures for September are particularly disappointing, as sales normally
pick up after the end of the school summer holidays. That failed to happen
this year. Both sales and demand for mortgages - reflecting sales likely to
be completed this month and next - fell sharply compared with September last
year.
Some estimates suggest that sales could have been as much as 40 per cent
down on September last year.
According to Halifax, the average price of a UK house fell by 7.5 per cent
to Pounds 62,605 during the 12 months to the end of September.
The biggest falls have been in southern England. In the past 12 months
prices have fallen by 9.8 per cent in London, by 8.5 per cent in south-east
England as a whole and by 6.8 per cent in south-west England and East
Anglia. By comparison, prices in northern England have fallen by 1.2 per
cent and prices in Scotland have risen by 0.3 per cent.
An average house in Greater London, however, still costs Pounds 84,511
compared with Pounds 66,455 in south-west England; Pounds 60,579 in East
Anglia; Pounds 61,608 in the West Midlands; Pounds 58,523 in north-west
England; Pounds 62,643 in Scotland and Pounds 52,033 in Wales.
'This is extremely bad news,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market
analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He said the market trend was
still 'sharply downwards' and that there was little prospect of a recovery
before 1994 without the government providing 'a major fiscal 'kick-start'
for the market to stop this perpetual decline'.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Government urges US to approve BA deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN called on the US yesterday to approve British Airways' Dollars 750m
(Pounds 441m) investment in a 44 per cent stake in USAir as a step towards
total liberalisation of air services between the two countries.
The Department of Transport said the UK had put forward 'serious and
detailed proposals' to open up UK/US air services during negotiations in
Washington this week.
The proposals contained 'a substantial range of liberalising measures which
can be taken in the short term'. The UK said it was waiting for a 'serious
response' and warned that progress on liberalisation would hinge on the US
approach to the BA-USAir deal.
'US approval will signal a liberal attitude and facilitate liberalisation:
rejection or delay will be an illiberal signal and will inhibit the
time-table,' the government said.
The UK proposals are understood to involve three stages: first, opening up
routes to regional UK airports from any US gateway followed by greater
access to London airports and finally the lifting of all controls on
capacity, access and designation.
In return, the UK is asking for a procedure to prevent dumping by US
carriers on the UK market and a procedure to settle eventual disputes.
The UK is also seeking the easing of rules on foreign ownership of US
airlines. First, foreign carriers should be allowed to acquire 49 per cent
of the voting rights of US carriers instead of the present 25 per cent
limit. The UK would eventually like to see all US limits on foreign
ownership lifted.
However, by making any future liberalisation of transatlantic air services
contingent on US approval of the BA-USAir deal, the government has thrown
the ball back into the US camp. Negotiations between the two sides are due
to resume on October 20.
The US authorities have come under intense pressure from the three biggest
US carriers - American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - to
block the BA-USAir deal unless they can first secure greater access into the
UK and continental European markets.
United Airlines said yesterday that the UK position was 'neither a detailed
nor serious liberalisation proposal'.
It claimed the proposals embodied 'a unique concept of further regulating a
market that is by today's standards already restrictive and protectionist'.
The carrier added that if the UK was 'really serious about its proposal, it
should release it publicly and be publicly addressed'.
However, UK officials rebuffed the airline's criticisms, arguing that the
package was 'a genuinely liberal agreement and not just a political ploy'.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, said this week
that his airline would fight vigorously 'for our right to make a legitimate
investment in USAir'.
BA is still hoping to secure US approval before the December 24 'walk away'
deadline for its transaction with USAir.

FT  10 OCT 92 / World accounts standards sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO set accounting standards should prepare a minimum core list of
requirements for companies seeking an international stock exchange listing,
Mr Hugh Collum, chairman of the Hundred Group of finance directors, said
yesterday.
Speaking at the Board of Chartered Accountants conference in Bristol, Mr
Collum, finance director of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs and
consumer goods group, emphasised the importance of cross-border
harmonisation of accounting.
He said directors needed to create standards that deliver 'equitable,
accurate, transparent, comprehensive and comprehensible accounts'. The
different standards between the UK and the US reduced accountancy 'to the
status of tribal black magic', he said.
Mr Collum believed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which
polices the securities and investments industry, and the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting standards in the US, are
developing core standards in conjunction with the European Community. In
practice, he expected much of the initiative to come from the UK's
Accounting Standards Board.
Mr Collum said businesses and the accounting profession had helped to
undermine corporate financial credibility through competitive pressures,
loose accounting standards, inadequate financial control systems and
confusion over responsibilities.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Vauxhall beats Ford in company car league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL has overtaken Ford for the first time as the most popular make of
company car in an annual survey of nearly 600 businesses.
The survey by Company Secretary's Review, one of the industry's best-known
market monitoring organisations, covered companies operating a combined
fleet of 35,000 cars. It found that Vauxhalls accounted for 31 per cent of
the total, while Ford's share had slipped to 25 per cent from 42 per cent.
The share of third-placed Rover Group, at 10 per cent, represents a fall
from 14 per cent last year. The study says that Rover's drop is probably
accounted for by its refusal to offer the same level of discounts as its
larger rivals, in spite of the fierce price war raging in the deeply
depressed market for new cars.
The study examines in detail the size of discounts obtained by the surveyed
companies.
It finds discounting highest among the volume producers, and appears to
dispel the widespread notion that some prestige cars, such as Mercedes-Benz,
are not discounted by their dealers. For example, an average discount of 7.9
per cent was reported as having been obtained on the Mercedes 190, higher
than either the 7.5 per cent achieved on Jaguar's saloon range or the 6.1
per cent obtained on BMW's 3-series cars.
Among the volume car manufacturers, the survey says, Ford discounts are
'consistently higher than those of Vauxhall or Rover, with around 15.5 per
cent obtained on every model'.
A mean discount of 14.9 per cent is found on the Vauxhall Cavalier, now the
single most popular car with 19 per cent of all sales. However, the survey
concludes that 'this figure drops on other Vauxhall models'. Ford's Sierra
is the second-most popular car, but it trails well behind the Cavalier in
accounting for only 12 per cent of the surveyed fleet and is being replaced
next year by a new model, the Mondeo.
Although the survey finds that discounts of 15 per cent are available on
Rover's aging Montego and Maestro models, those available on the mainstream
Rover 200, 400 and 800 ranges are between 11.2 per cent and 12.2 per cent -
more than 3 percentage points below Ford.
The biggest discounts were to be found among Peugeot and Citroen models. The
French group has more than doubled its share in the surveyed fleet, and with
a combined 11 per cent is ahead of Rover. However, 'they continue to boost
their presence in the fleet market by selective heavy discounting of over 16
per cent in some cases'.
Among other findings, the survey says: Companies are keeping cars longer and
running them to higher mileages. Some 35 per cent now run cars for more than
65,000 miles, up from 28 per cent a year previously.
There is strong evidence of 'down-sizing' of cars made available to
employees, with the trend most notable among senior managers.
In spite of the recession, only half the companies surveyed make a concerted
effort to monitor company car costs.

FT  10 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market retreats after Major speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market gave a muted response to the keynote speech by Mr John
Major, the prime minister, at the Conservative party's conference in
Brighton, with share prices sliding back to close only marginally higher on
the day, having opened with widespread and sizeable gains.
But market commentators were reasonably happy with the performance of the
market over a week which saw the FT-SE 100 index drop over 100 points on
Monday, when sterling was in free fall against the D-mark, before embarking
on a determined recovery.
The closing state of the market was in marked contrast to the general view
at the outset of trading. Share prices opened on a strong note, reflecting a
good showing by Wall Street overnight and another positive performance by
sterling against the dollar and the D-mark.
Another positive factor in the market was a growing feeling that a series of
takeover bids may be about to emerge. Traders and fund managers have been on
the alert for possible stake-building exercises and bid moves since the UK
withdrew from the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Hongkong Land's dawn raid and tender offer for Trafalgar stock and Hanson's
bid for RHM are seen as merely the start of a flurry of corporate activity.
'The devaluation of sterling makes UK companies now look very cheap to
European and American predators,' said one dealer.
The Footsie opened 11 points higher and topped out in mid-morning when the
index posted a 28-point gain. There was little reaction from the markets to
the latest inflation figure. Bouts of profit-taking chopped the rise to one
of 11 points immediately before the prime minister spoke.
By the time Mr Major resumed his seat, the Footsie was a mere 2.8 higher. It
closed 2.4 firmer at 2,541.2, down 8.5 on the week but well clear of the
2,446.3 reached last Monday when sterling plunged in the foreign exchange
markets. Traders added that London was showing more concern about Wall
Street where the Dow Jones average was down 28 points as London closed.
Mr Richard Jeffrey, equity market strategist at Charterhouse Tilney, the
stockbroker, said: 'Until the market is reassured it will find it hard to
make good ground; it needs another interest rate cut.' Turnover of 484.4m
shares was disappointingly low, comparing badly with Thursday's 517.6m.
Retail, or customer, business in London began to tail off early in the week
but quickly revived following two sizeable bought deals and a number of
programme trades.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): No end to the nickel
nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAILURE of the nickel market to respond to production cuts by the
western world's biggest producer underlines the continuing gloom in the base
metals market, which once again suffered price falls across the board.
However, analysts have not been surprised by the nickel market's lack of
reaction to news from Toronto that Inco is cutting production by 18,000
tonnes over the next 12 months, equal to about 3 per cent of Western
consumption. 'It was too little, too late,' commented one yesterday.
The cuts at Inco were needed because of a fall in stainless steel
production, which accounts for more than half of nickel consumption, and
sharp increases in exports from Russia, which is now shipping about 100,000
tonnes a year, equivalent to 15 per cent of total supplies.
A seminar in Sudbury, Ontario, heard on Wednesday that output from Russia's
Norilsk complex would remain flat in the near future if productivity could
be maintained. Geologists said that reserves are estimated at 70 years, and
that there are several new mines in development in Norilsk with good enough
grades to offset depletion of some of the area's high-grade deposits.
Canadian analysts said the Russian news suggested a price recovery was some
way away.
There is no doubt that Inco feels it should not have to suffer alone, and
the company has made it quite clear that it intends to maintain its market
share of 25 to 30 per cent. But on Thursday Falconbridge, the next biggest
western producer, said that, while a production cut was 'likely', no
decision would be made for at least a few weeks.
At the same time French producer SLN (Societe Metallurgique le Nickel) and
Finland's Outukumpu said they had no plans to curb production. SLN already
expects output to fall to some 39,000 tonnes this year, compared with 43,500
tonnes in 1991. Outokumpu pointed out that its annual production of 13,800
tonnes is less than Inco's planned cut.
Yesterday a further inflow of Russian metal took nickel stocks in LME
warehouses up 2,886 tonnes, taking the total to a record 49,410 tonnes. Cash
metal closed at Dollars 6,615 a tonne, down Dollars 90 on the week and
equivalent to Dollars 3 a lb.
Other base metals have been 'whiplashed by a torrent of poor economic data'
from the US, Japan and the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development, according to Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett. The OECD,
which was predicting gross domestic product growth of 2.2 per cent in member
countries this year, said it would now not exceed 1.5 per cent.
'The onus is back squarely on metal producers,' said Mr Moore. 'The choice
is simple - cut back refined metal output or spend another year in
purgatory.'
The LME's first totally new contract for 13 years was launched on Tuesday
for secondary aluminium alloy. It has got off to a slow start - but the
exchange was not expecting anything else. 'It will take time to bed down,'
said Mr John Wolff, LME chairman. 'But it is a very large market and
growing.'
Mr Ralph Kestenbaum, chairman of the exchange's aluminium committee, pointed
out that in unofficial trading over the past two months alloy had been
traded at a Dollars 10 a tonne discount to the primary aluminium contract,
and also at a Dollars 65 discount. This showed that the primary contract was
not a satisfactory proxy for alloy and that the new contract was necessary.
Cash trading will start on January 4. The three-month price closed at
Dollars 1,158 yesterday, down Dollars 17 on Tuesday's close. Cash aluminium
closed at Dollars 1,186, down Dollars 26.50 on the week.
In the bullion markets gold has maintained its level at the top of its
recent trading range, but platinum has fallen back, losing Dollars 8.75 a
troy ounce this week to Dollars 356 yesterday. Most of the fall came on
Wednesday as sales by a US investment bank focused dealers' attention on the
deteriorating economic situation and the weak base metals market. On
Thursday sentiment was further clouded by reports of the Japanese market
awash with platinum and investors selling nearby positions on the Tokyo
Commodities Exchange.
The silver market was sceptical about a study for the Washington-based
Silver Institute which suggested that conventional world silver stocks are
2.6bn troy ounces, but that 1.5bn ounces were unavailable to the market.
Silver closed in London at 379.50 cents a troy ounce, up 4 cents on the
week.

FT  10 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Standard bid hints refuted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALK that a predator might be stalking Standard Chartered gave a rationale
for a sharp rise in the shares but was largely discounted by many senior
analysts.
The shares had fallen 45p since the end of September and were beginning to
look cheap when a well-timed piece of research from BZW, gave them a fillip
earlier in the week.
The initial rally received a further boost yesterday with the return of
speculation that the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) was poised to bid -
Standard shares jumped almost 20p before settling with the market to close
12 better at 493p on reasonable turnover of 2.8m shares.
However, analysts said Standard was treating the speculation with caution
and they argued that DBS had strong links with the government of Singapore
which was unlikely to approve hostile bids for a UK bank. They added that
the DBS balance sheet was not strong enough for a bid of this size. Standard
has a stock market value of over Pounds 1bn.
Owners volatile
The rollercoaster ride in the shares of Owners Abroad continued unabated
yesterday as rumours refused to fade over the prospects for an imminent
takeover bid. Some in the market complained that the proxy 'takeover
situation' was creating a false market in the shares as traders were forced
to extend the trading range of the shares to 10p at one stage to discourage
the speculation.
However, City talk continued to point to LTU, the German group admitting
yesterday that talks had taken place with Owners. The most favoured option
being touted in the market has LTU buying a stake in the UK's second biggest
tour operator, thus discouraging the attention of Airtours, ranked number
three in the industry, and thought to be the unamed company which Owners
said had approached it three weeks ago. Airtours has refused to comment on
the situation.
Owners shares, which opened at 69 1/2 , touched 82 1/2 at one stage before
retreating to close 3 1/2 up on the day at 73p. Turnover was a hefty 7.1m.
Airtours dropped a penny to 236p.
Trafalgar active
Trafalgar House had a busy session as Hongkong Land's tender offer for 15
per cent to add to the 14.9 per cent acquired last week drew to a close with
dealers predicting certain failure for the Far Eastern group.
The ordinary shares eased a penny to 85 1/2 p, the tender offer being at
85p, while the 'A' class shares also softened a penny to 82 1/2 p, just
ahead of the offer price of 82p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which recently became
joint broker to Trafalgar, was reported to have been a keen player
throughout the session, sending turnover soaring to 7m shares.
One observer predicted HK Land was unlikely to gain more than a handful of
shares for its tender offer with the talk of changes in the top of the
management of the company cited as reasons for the reluctance of investors
to sell.
A series of downgrades in Tate and Lyle knocked the shares as the company
held meetings with selected broking houses. Nomura, Cazenove and Panmure
Gordon snipped their forecasts, although Nomura insisted that the new
figures reflected a change in accounting policy by the group and that
trading remained sound. The shares fell 6 to 341p.
Profit-taking continued in Unilever, the shares retreating 6 to 1025p.
Life insurer Legal &amp; General recovered from some rough handling earlier in
the week and closed 14 better at 347p. The shares also received some support
from a short-term buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson.
Textiles group Lamont Holdings plunged 65 to 238p. Jokes about possible
associations with the chancellor of the exchequer abounded but the reality
was a 44 per cent slide in interim profits to Pounds 2.18m. The slide was
largely prompted by problems in the groups Shaw Carpets arm and led to
general reductions in forecasts. SG Warburg has slashed its estimate for the
full year to Pounds 6.75m. At the time of a rights issue in April the market
was looking for around Pounds 11m.
Speciality chemicals group Laporte rose 8 to 561p, helped by a buy note from
BZW. The house argues that worries over the company's quality of earnings,
cash generation and medium term prospects have been overdone.
New subscriber figures from Vodafone indicated that the cellular telephone
group had won a hefty 8,300 new customers in September. The shares added 3
to 339p.
The oil majors were among the poorest performers in the Footsie. Worries
about the international chemicals business, highlighted by a recent cautious
presentation by Shell Chemicals, triggered persistent US selling, which
lowered BP 3 1/2 to 214 1/2 p, on good turnover of 9.9m and Shell 3 to 519p
on 4.4m traded.
Small exploration company Clyde Petroleum jumped sharply after securities
house Hoare Govett argued that the shares were heavily undervalued.
Clyde had said that development of the Gryphon oil field in the North Sea,
in which it has a 35 per cent stake, was being speeded up. As a result,
Hoare argued that the group's shares should be valued at 60p each to put the
Clyde on a par with its peers in the sector. Clyde lifted 5 1/2 to 38p.
British Gas improved 2 1/2 to 251p with one house suggesting that the
regulators might relax some constraints. Meanwhile, Lasmo slipped 1 1/2 p on
a County NatWest sell recommendation.
Barclays Bank saw heavy two-way turnover of 9.7m shares boosted by an agency
cross of 1m at 346p a share. Observers said debate over the security of the
dividend was prompting interest.
British Steel, which has been under pressure in recent months, moved up 2
1/2 to 62 1/2 p on good turnover of 8.2m shares. The market responded to a
buy note issued by Japanese-owned stockbroker Nomura, which said Steel will
benefit from sustained devaluation of sterling.
A bout of profit-taking and a profit forecast downgrade from Panmure Gordon
depressed Forte, the shares shedding 5 to 154p. Big turnover for a second
day in Queens Moat Houses, yesterday reaching 8.4m, left the shares a
half-penny off at 35p.
A large agency cross in Great Portland, with 2m shares thought to have been
traded at 98p, left the stock 2 lighter at 101p.
Consideration of Bowater following a three-day company visit by analysts led
to a fall in the share price, which was marked down by 20 to 820p on very
thin turnover. Analysts said they had no complaints about the company but
the share price was 'well up with events'.
Paper manufacturer Arjo Wiggins Appleton continued easier following a recent
forecast downgrade. Yesterday the shares were held back by a large agency
cross at 154 1/2 p and closed 2 off at 154p on turnover of 6.3m.
Hints from government ministers that the Sunday trading laws may be reformed
gave a lift to a number of stores stocks, among which Kingfisher advanced 8
to 508p and Dixons put on 7 to 209p.
Airports group BAA moved ahead 11 to 721p after Kleinwort Benson reiterated
its buy recommendation. Mr Peter Bergius at the securities house said the
the earnings outlook for the company was encouraging being both a defensive
and early cycle stock.
International trader and Toyota distributor Inchcape jumped 7 to 488p after
broker Robert Fleming upgraded profit expectations.
Among engineering stock, Smiths Industries were wanted and gained 6 to close
at 323p.

FT  10 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG rally on Wall Street late on Thursday along with continued talk
of a cut in interest rates provided the spur for the first half of trading
in Friday's session, before the early decline on Wall Street and dimming
rate hopes led to a retreat in the afternoon, writes Joel Kibazo.
The December contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,583 and was soon carried
forward by the speculation on interest rates, reaching the session's high of
2,608 at around 11am. The lack of further news on that front led to a tail
off in buying. The 11.30am release of the inflation figures for September in
line with expectations had no significant impact on trading.
Arbitrage activity mid-afternoon, as the contract traded at a discount, led
to a reversal in the fortunes of December and it closed at 2,575, just two
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 32. Turnover
was 9,316 lots.
Traded options were dull with turnover falling to 26,520 contracts by the
close and the FT-SE 100 option trading a mere 6,984 lots. Barclays Bank was
the most actively dealt stock option at 4,030.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Sterling rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH rates in the sterling money market continued to ease yesterday as
traders grew increasingly confident that the Bundesbank would reduce
official rates at its council meeting next week, writes James Blitz.
There were rumours that the UK authorities would reduce base rates in the
morning because the currency rallied to DM2.5106 against the D-Mark
overnight, but the rate cut did not materialise. Nevertheless, the market
continues to be caught up in speculation that a cut in German official rates
is in the offing.
How likely is such a cut ? The speculation is founded on the recent trimming
of the rates at which the Bundesbank deals in the German money market down
to 8.9 per cent, a level 60 basis points below the Lombard rate.
This suggests that the Bundesbank could take 50 basis points off the Lombard
rate, currently at 9.5 per cent, without affecting the structure of market
rates.
However, Miss Alison Cottrell, an international analyst at Midland Montagu
in London, suggested that the Bundesbank may not ease official rates for
some time yet. The huge interventions to support European currencies in
recent weeks would make an official easing unlikely.
For the moment, the market is putting its money on a cut before December.
The December Euromark futures contract finished the week at 91.79, roughly
unchanged on the day, a level that presupposes that German 3 month money
will be at 8.21 per cent at the year end.
The December Sterling contract closed at 91.86, down 3 basis points on the
day, assuming that 3-month money will be at 8.14 per cent by the year's end.
Cash rates in the sterling money market were also softer. Three-month money,
a key indicator of how the market thinks base rates are moving, closed at 8
13/16 per cent on the offered side, down  1/16 per cent on the day.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn. In the morning, it
purchased Pounds 361m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, Pounds 101m of
Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 332m in a repurchase
agreement at 8 15/16 per cent.
In further operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 188m of Band 1 bank bills
and Pounds 25m of Band 2 bank bills, providing late assistance of Pounds
65m.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar consolidates its gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE another turbulent week in the foreign exchange markets, dealers are
wondering whether currency tensions have significantly eased following the
subtle changes in German monetary policy, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday, sterling, the dollar and the Italian lira all continued to gain
against the German currency as dealers digested the recent cuts in the
Bundesbank's money market dealing rates.
The Bundesbank again injected liquidity into the German money markets at a
rate of 8.9 per cent, 60 basis points below the emergency Lombard rate,
which provides the ceiling for official rates. Technically, the Bundesbank
could reduce the Lombard rate by  1/2 a percentage point without affecting
the structure of market rates.
Germany's high monetary growth makes this a difficult option. Nevertheless,
three other factors have weakened the D-Mark this week.
German industry faces growing problems, highlighted by yesterday's news that
German exports fell 19 per cent in August.
The Bundesbank drained more liquidity from the market in September than had
been thought. A London based analyst said yesterday that the Bank had
drained DM75bn of liquidity compared to intervention of about DM92bn last
month, controlling growth in the M3 money supply.
The US Federal Reserve looks as though it will not cut interest rates until
after the US Presidential election because it regards the signs of economic
slowdown as inconclusive. The differential between US and German short term
rates looks unlikely to widen in the next two months.
The dollar yesterday closed in London at DM1.4855, up 8 pfennigs on the
week. Sterling closed at DM2.5125 this week, up nearly 15 pfennigs from
Monday's lows, despite a troubled Conservative party conference.
Pressure has not come off the weaker currencies in the Exchange Rate
Mechanism. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in
London, says the lira's devaluation puts pressure on the peseta and escudo
because their economies are closely linked. 'Relative competitiveness and a
devalued lira put pressure on the other two,' he said. The peseta closed at
Pta71.51, near to its floor of Pta72.62.
The French franc is in a category of its own. The franc's overnight rate was
at 12 per cent last night, with the currency closing at FFr3.388 to the
D-Mark, against an ERM floor of FFr3.4305. Ms Joanne Perez of Banque
Indosuez in Paris says the central bank's reserves are at a mere FFr20bn,
making high interest rates the only effective weapon.

FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford warns of quarterly deficit
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Ford Motor, the US motor manufacturer, fell sharply yesterday
morning following a warning from the company of third-quarter losses which
might extend into the final three months of the year.
The profits warning came after the market closed on Thursday in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a Dollars 1bn offer of
perpetual preferred stock.
Ford shares closed at Dollars 34 3/4 , down Dollars 2 7/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday.
Ford said industry sales rates in the US, Europe and other markets remained
low compared with long-term trend levels and these factors, coupled with
seasonal dealer inventory adjustments, were expected to result in a
third-quarter loss.
Analysts had already been forecasting a loss for the period of around
Dollars 150m.
Ford added that its losses could extend into the fourth quarter, partially
offsetting the Dollars 840m the company earned in the first half of the
year.
However, Ford said it still expected 1992 full-year results to represent a
substantial improvement over its Dollars 2.26bn losses in 1991 and it
expected continued improvement in 1993 earnings, 'assuming that US and
European economic conditions and industry volumes improve'.
The company said the issue of preferred stock, which will not be convertible
into Ford common stock, represented 'an attractive opportunity to take
advantage of strong individual investor demand and the present low level of
fixed income yields'.
The offering would be made in the near future after SEC approval. In
November last year Ford sold Dollars 2.3bn of convertible preferred stock at
an interest rate of 8.4 per cent.
On Tuesday at the Paris Auto Show, Mr Allan Gilmour, Ford Automotive Group
president, underlined the company's commitment to maintaining its product
and technology investment programme despite market weakness.
In the filing, Ford said it expected its second-half 1992 capital
expenditures to exceed the Dollars 2.5bn in the first half of 1992.

<TEXT>
FORD, the US car maker, yesterday appointed Mr Jacques Nasser as the next
chairman of its loss-making Ford of Europe operations, write Kevin Done in
London and Kevin Brown in sydney.
Mr Nasser, a 44-year-old Lebanese Australian and presently chief executive
of Ford of Australia, is to replace Mr Lindsey Halstead, 62, who is to
retire after a 40-year career with Ford. Mr Halstead has been chairman of
Ford of Europe since 1989.
Mr Nasser becomes chairman-elect of Ford of Europe with immediate effect and
will take over from Mr Halstead on January 1. He is to be succeeded in
Australia by Mr John Ogden, currently director of car programmes for Ford's
North American automotive operations.
Mr Nasser faces a formidable challenge to lead the restructuring of Ford of
Europe, which suffered record losses last year and which is forecast to make
another loss in 1992.
Ford, which was narrowly the leader of the west European new car market in
1984, has slipped to fifth place among the big six volume car makers in
Europe.
Mr Nasser's appointment confirms his reputation as one of the company's
rising stars, and he will take over a European organisation, which last year
had a workforce of just under 100,000 and produced 1.8m vehicles.
He started his career as a financial analyst for Ford in Melbourne in 1968,
but has moved rapidly up the international management ladder since beginning
a 14-year stint overseas in 1975.
He returned to Ford Australia as chief executive in 1989 from Autolatina,
Ford's joint venture with Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina, which he
helped set up and where he became the first finance director in 1987.
Always an outspoken manager, he has taken tough action to prepare Ford
Australia for stiffer competition, prompted by a rise in vehicle imports
from 30 per cent of the market three years ago to 50 per cent this year.

FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Citicorp sees Dollars 800m gains
on disposals

<TEXT>
CITICORP, the leading US bank, is hoping to record as much as Dollars 800m
of pre-tax gains in the next few months from the disposal of assets, much of
them equity holdings in Latin America.
The disclosure was made by Mr John Reed, the Citicorp chairman, in the first
of a series of presentations to investors being made in conjunction with the
bank's offer of Dollars 650m of preferred stock.
Although the bank is not allowed under US securities law to comment on the
substance of Mr Reed's forecasts, Wall Street analysts who attended the
presentation detailed the Citicorp chairman's remarks. They said Mr Reed
also said he hoped it would be possible to restore payment of the bank's
dividend - which was halted in the third quarter of last year - by 1994.
Mr Reed, who yesterday spoke to investors in Boston and will hold similar
meetings in California early next week, was asked by investors why Mr
Richard Braddock, the Citicorp president, resigned abruptly earlier this
week.
Although many on Wall Street believe that Mr Braddock was forced out of the
bank, Mr Reed said his close friend and long-time aide had resigned because
a series of key Citicorp managers were no longer reporting to him. He added
that Mr Braddock had largely completed his task of cutting costs.
Analysts have said the departure of Mr Braddock - together with Citicorp's
disclosure that it would suffer an Dollars 870m third-quarter write-off in
its consumer division and that its net earnings in the third quarter would
be about half the expected level - could affect the market's response to the
Dollars 650m preferred stock offer.
Morgan Stanley is expected to price the three-year convertible stock offer
next Wednesday, at a yield of between 7 3/4 and 8 1/4 per cent.
In his New York presentation, Mr Reed was asked for assurances that the bank
would not again seek rapid growth once its capital had been bolstered and
its profitability restored.
Mr Reed, while telling investors that he wished to preserve the bank's
global franchise, admitted: 'We can never be like we once were.'

KRAFT General Foods International, part of the Philip Morris group of the
US, yesterday moved a step closer to gaining control of Freia Marabou,
Scandinavia's leading chocolate, sugar confectionery and snacks producer.
Freia Marabou shareholders voted to change the company's articles of
association by abolishing the rule which limits foreign ownership to one
third of the capital. This was one of the the US group's conditions set by
KGFI subsidiary Jacobs Souchard on September 28 when it offered Dollars
1.5bn to acquire Freia Marabou .
Shareholders also changed the rules to allow new shareholders to acquire
voting rights immediately. Under previous rules they had to wait four weeks
to acquire voting rights.
The only outstanding hurdle left for KGFI to clear before gaining control of
Freia is being granted an ownership concession by Norwegian authorities.
KGFI will also have to secure the backing of a majority of Freia's
shareholders, but this was already accomplished in theory by a
recommendation of support last month by Norsk Hydro, Freia's biggest
shareholder, which controls 44.1 per cent of its shares. Shareholders have
until November 11 to accept KGFI's offer.
KGFI's bid for Freia Marabou was NKr450 a share but Hershey Foods Corp
offered NKr425, or dollars 1.3bn to acquire the company. Hershey owns an
18.6 per cent stake in Freia.
Mr Sverre E Koch, an Oslo attorney with Thommessen, Krefting &amp; Greve which
represents Hershey, said that the outcome of yesterday's extraordinary
general meeting weakened Hershey's position in its consideration to launch a
rival bid for Freia.
'It is clear that Hershey's position was weakened by the outcome of
(today's) meeting,' Mr Koch said. Hershey has been holding talks with Orkla,
the Norwegian diversified food group, about launching a rival bid. Mr Koch
said talks were still underway but no decision has yet been taken on whether
to proceed.

NATIONAL Westminster Bancorp, the wholly-owned US subidiary of Britain's
National Westminster Bank, yesterday said its recovery was continuing thanks
to a Dollars 39.4m third-quarter net profit. This compared with a loss of
Dollars 65.7m in the third quarter of last year.
Over the past couple of years Natwest's US subsidiary has been hit by a
number of property loan problems, including its exposure to Mr Donald Trump,
the property and casino developer. The bank has implemented sweeping
management changes in its US unit.
Mr John Tugwell, chairman of Natwest Bancorp, said yesterday he was
encouraged by the improving performance and the underlying strength of the
bank's core business. He said the introduction of new products had enabled
the bank to achieve growth in its net income despite the difficult regional
economy and lack of loan demand.
Bad debt provisions in the third quarter were Dollars 30.5m, down from
Dollars 123.1m a year ago. For the first nine months of 1992 provisions were
Dollars 91.5m, down from Dollars 479.7m in the same period of 1991.
Net income for the first nine months of 1992 was Dollars 105.5m, a
significant turnround from the Dollars 341.7m of losses recorded in the same
period last year.
Total assets of the US subsidiary at the end of the third quarter were
Dollars 22.3bn, up from Dollars 21.6bn a year ago. The total loan book stood
at Dollars 14.1bn, down from Dollars 14.6bn a year ago. Deposits were
Dollars 13.5bn, up from Dollars 13.1bn.
Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 4.54 per cent,
against 4.62 per cent a year ago.

following the discovery of off-balance sheet losses at Ciments Francais, the
cement company in which it is selling its controlling stake to Italy's
Italcementi
Paribas, which faces a possible compensation claim from Italcementi for part
of the purchase price on the Ciments Francais stake, yesterday confirmed it
was planning to lodge a legal suit. But it has not yet decided on the final
form of the action, or whether it would mount the case alone or together
with Italcementi.
Paribas would have to decide whether to mount a case against the Ciments
Francais board, or against Mr Pierre Conso, who resigned on Wednesday as
chairman of the company on the disclosure of the losses.
The losses are believed to have arisen from share repurchase agreements
undertaken between Ciments Francais and a variety of third parties, in
offshore financial centres such as Guernsey and the Bahamas. In the deals,
the French company is thought to have sold stakes in foreign subsidiaries
under its control and in other companies in which it was a minority
shareholder on the basis that it would buy back the securities at a
pre-established price later.
Many, if not all, the companies concerned were quoted. Subsequent falls in
their share prices left Ciments Francais facing extraordinary losses on the
deals. The French group is also believed to have promised to pay its
counterparties interest on the funds provided against the shares.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the watchdog of the Paris
stockmarket, has opened an investigation into the Ciments Francais
controversy.
Italcementi's auditors, KPMG, are still trying to discover where the money
has gone. It could then establish the purpose of the transactions.
French press reports estimate the likely level of the losses at between
FFr400m (Dollars 83.7m) and FFr500m.
Paribas has started discussions with Italcementi over the implications of
the losses for their deal. Italcementi's agreement to buy control of Ciments
Francais from Paribas was announced in April, but is not due for completion
until the year-end.
The terms of the agreement are thought to include reference to exceptional
circumstances, which could include the discovery of off-balance sheet
losses. However, the two sides have not yet been able to assess the full
implications of Ciments Francais' losses for their agreement. While
Italcementi might try to negotiate a lower acquisition price, a simpler
solution would be for Paribas to make up the losses once their full extent
is known.

FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa seeks a stake in
Luxair
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the loss-making state German airline, is pressing ahead with
talks which may lead to its taking a stake in Luxair, the Luxembourg
carrier.
The companies confirmed yesterday that negotiations were in progress with
the aim of either intensifying existing co-operation or Lufthansa's buying
part of its tiny neighbour. Luxair said in statement that the aim was to
sign 'a detailed accord, before the end of the year', although Lufthansa
refused to commit itself to a particular timescale for the deal.
A maximum of 38.3 per cent of the Luxembourg airline is up for sale.
Luxair's own shareholding of 26.2 per cent has to be reduced to 10 per cent
by next year to conform with new legislation and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise
de Telediffusion, the Luxembourg-based broadcasting group, wants to sell a
further 12.1 per cent.
Luxair said it had issued its statement to dispel rumours in the Luxembourg
press that the talks - which began about six months ago - had been abandoned
because of Lufthansa's financial difficulties. Luxair itself announced a
profit of LFr122m (Dollars 4m) for 1991.
Although it is racked by losses and preoccupied with a massive internal
restructuring programme, Lufthansa continues to press ahead with plans to
build its international presence through co-operation and acquisition rather
than organic growth.
Lufthansa, government controlled but earmarked for privatisation, announced
a pre-tax loss in the first half of DM542m (Dollars 384.30) and recently
unveiled plans to cut 6,000 jobs over the next two years, following a 1,800
reduction in the current year.

BRAMALEA, one of two real estate developers controlled by Toronto's Bronfman

debenture holders agrees to support a debt-restructuring plan, writes
Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Mr Marvin Marshall, Bramalea's chief executive, said European individual
holders whom the company met in London this week were supportive of the
plan. The plan aims to cut Bramalea's debt from CDollars 4.9bn to about
CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) over five years through asset sales and

FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: Care of elderly creating enormous challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FOSTER MURPHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Family Policy Studies Centre research findings ('Cost of
residential care 'forcing old to sell homes'', October 5) show that young
people may find their legacies depleted by the cost of caring for elderly
parents and may place older people in a dilemma over depriving children of
their inheritance. The fact is that Britain is now facing an enormous
challenge in care provision for frail elderly people. Older home-owners
needing care are presently having to sell houses at lower prices in the
present property slump so the capital realised buys even less residential
care. As older people can now expect to live into their 90s their 'children'
are probably in their 60s and pensioners themselves]
Within 10 years, it is estimated another 100,000 residential places will be
needed. Despite assurances by health secretary Mrs Virginia Bottomley that
community care finance will be partially ring-fenced in the early years,
this charity's concern is that these funds will be woefully insufficient.
The government really must take a lead to sort out the matter of long-term
care for ever increasing numbers of frail, elderly people. Unless it does,
the nation will be faced with a serious situation where elderly frail people
simply have nowhere to go and no funds.
Sufferers will not be young people with no legacies, but frail elderly
people, their carers and the family as a whole.

FT  10 OCT 92 / A snapshot of history: The aims and scope of the FT's new
indices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing that so perfectly captures a sense of time or place as the
purely ephemeral. A long-forgotten bus ticket or a few phrases of a
once-popular song can evoke a reverie of instant nostalgia.
For those who care about a country's commercial history, stock market
indices produce the same effect. Just reading through the list of companies
in the original Financial News Industrial Ordinary Share index catches the
flavour of UK industry, circa 1935: Bolsover Collieries, Austin Motor,
Dunlop Rubber, Fine Spinners and Doublers, Murex, United Steel, Harrods . .
. companies which long ago lost their independence or importance. The
Financial News itself, of course, has become part of the Financial Times,
which still publishes the index.
Some of the companies in that 1935 list still flourish independently today:
Bass, Courtaulds (now in two halves), GEC, Guest Keen and Nettlefolds (now
GKN), Imperial Chemical Industries, Turner &amp; Newall (now T&amp;N), Vickers, and
so on. Several present-day companies contain more than one member of the
original list: thus Hanson owns both London Brick and Imperial Tobacco;
British Steel is the heir to Dorman Long and United Steel; Coats Viyella
owns J&amp;P Coats and Patons &amp; Baldwins; and BTR owns Hawker Siddeley and
Dunlop Rubber.
The index itself has been overtaken by time. Surpassed in thoroughness by
the FT-Actuaries All-Share index of 1962, outflanked in method of
calculation by the FT-SE 100 of 1984, it is no longer the central yardstick
of the London share market.
Its history illustrates how much sentiment can attach to a simple daily
number. The index's all-time low was reached on June 26 1940, when it
touched 49.4, half its initial value. That day - the low point of British
fortunes during the second world war, with the remnants of the British
Expeditionary Force just back from Dunkirk and the Luftwaffe appearing daily
in the skies about southern England - is thus commemorated in each day's
newspaper, in a modest footnote recording the index's highs and lows.
One can only hope that the new FT-SE indices, to be launched on Monday,
attract no such momentous footnotes. Their aims are, in some respects, more
modest than those of the original 30-share index. It was conceived as a way
of casting light on the speed of the economy's recovery from the slump of
the early 1930s.
The new indices are aimed, more modestly, at shedding light on the inner
workings of stock market trading: allowing investors to tell whether
mid-sized companies are doing better or worse than their larger rivals; and
giving them a minute-by-minute guide to which groups of stocks are doing
best and worst.
The first of those roles will be filled by the new FT-SE Mid 250 index,
which covers the 250 companies that rank below the FT-SE 100 in market
capitalisation, from roughly Pounds 150m to Pounds 1bn. In some years there
is a big difference between the stock market performance of mid-sized
companies and that of their bigger rivals. This will now be clearer, day by
day.
The second role is filled by the minute-by-minute calculation of industry
baskets based on the new FT-SE Actuaries 350, shares in the top 350 UK
companies (that is, the FT-SE 100 plus the FT-SE Mid 250). Shares are
allocated to industry baskets using the sector classification devised for
the FT-Actuaries All-Share index.
The new indices reflect important changes in the way stock market indices
are viewed by professional investors. For many years, the FT collected
individual share prices on the floor of the stock exchange, and calculated
its indices manually.
Much has changed since then. First, the success of the All-Share has led to
a general consensus about what is the proper way to construct indices. In
the UK, at least, there is now a well-understood set of mathematical
principles on which most investors agree indices should be based.
Second, indices themselves have come to play a central role in investment
management. Despairing of beating the index, an increasing proportion of
pensions funds have settled for joining it: that is, investing in every
share in a broad-based index, in an effort to match its performance exactly.
This style of passive investing, index-matching, has made the indices'
hitherto arcane rules on which shares are eligible and which are not a
matter of intense concern to the companies concerned. A share excluded from
a broad-based index will find itself excluded from the holdings of the
index-matchers, and thus deprived of at least one possible source of
support.
Third, individual share prices are now delivered in real time to anybody
prepared to pay the relatively modest fees required by the London Stock
Exchange and commercial quote vendors. And fourth, personal computers and
spreadsheet technology allow the rapid construction of indices - even
real-time ones. The drudgery of calculation has been removed.
Over time, this will lead to the development of lots of new indices. Some
will meet a real market need and survive; others will prove to have only a
limited interest. Some will be deliberately intended to have only a short
life-span, such as the FT Election Share Index, constructed during the last
election campaign to show day-to-day movements in politically sensitive
stocks.
Taken together, all these developments change the role of the index
provider. The emphasis shifts from the sheer wonder of calculating the index
at all to the need to design and manage the index in a way that best meets
the needs of investors.
In the light of these trends, a working party set up by the London Stock
Exchange, in conjunction with the FT and the actuarial profession, has
examined the way indices cover the UK market. It was chaired by Mr Gordon
Bagot, of the WM Company (a firm that specialises in measuring the stock
market performance of pension funds). The new indices are one result of the
working party's recommendations. But in a sense they are only the tip of the
iceberg. Just as important is the way the FT-SE, the new indices, and the
All-Share will now form part of a coherent set of indices, with common rules
for eligibility, and a common structure of management and supervision.
That is the dull stuff of committees and sub-clauses. Fifty years from now,
however, someone will come across the companies in the FT-SE Mid 250 printed
in yesterday's paper, and they will marvel at the nostalgia evoked by some
of those names: Laura Ashley, Body Shop, Eurotunnel, Iceland Frozen Foods,
Lonrho, Queens Moat Houses, Scottish Television, Trafalgar House . . .
Wasn't the 1990s a wonderfully romantic period?

FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: ASB proposals for minimum of 'fudging' in company
accounts should be welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr W I D PLAISTOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr David Damant's circulars 'Earnings' and 'Unfudgeability' described
in your article,'Fudge-free accounting plans incompatible with reality'
(September 29), provide an interesting counter-argument to the general
tendency of accounting standard-setters to impose greater comparability in
financial reporting.
His thesis should not, however, be too readily accepted. The reduction of
differences in the accounting treatment of events and transactions arising
in the same circumstances must surely remain as the standards-setters' prime
objective.
The current concern of investment analysts at the prospective loss of a
'fudged' earnings per share figure as a result of the virtual elimination of
extraordinary items planned by the Accounting Standards Board seems
perverse.
Mr Damant explains this concern by saying that the new earnings figure will
not be a true measure of the company's ongoing earning power. Is ever such a
thing available, however? The current measurement of earnings, by permitting
too loose an interpretation for events and transactions outside the ordinary
activities of the business, thereby allowing the figure for earnings from
those ordinary activities to be 'fudged', cannot surely be the true measure
that he seeks.
Are not the results of accidental happenings, which he suggests should be
excluded from the company's measure of performance, in fact the very stuff
of everyday business life?
The ASB's proposals for the minimum of 'fudging' in profit and loss accounts
should allow analysts a better insight into company results and should be
welcomed.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN CALVERLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the government's search for a new monetary policy one obvious idea
is to adopt explicit inflation targets, as used in Canada and New Zealand.
For example, the UK could announce targets of, say, 3 per cent for December
1993 and 2 per cent for December 1994, excluding mortgage rates.
This approach would conform to the prime minister's insistence that low
inflation remains the top priority while leaving the way open for interest
rate cuts ahead of Germany if the economy remains weak.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: Suppliers victims of supermarket squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN FONTANNAZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, What a nerve Mr Robey] ('Tesco executive attacks 'second rate'
suppliers', October 7). And from a company whose late chairman's motto was
'Pile it high and sell it cheap'. Sir Jack Cohen had the right ideas by
giving the public a fair deal and food at affordable prices, to an
acceptable quality.
What have we now? Five supermarket chains which control the whole grocery
trade. And it is they, not the suppliers, which have introduced thousands of
'me-too' products by the introduction of own-label brands. Where's the
choice? And where's the quality? The supermarket chains have been able to
nit-pick about quality or price with the unfortunate own-label packers
which, because of the financial pressure placed upon them, will agree to
almost anything to stay in business.
How many times have suppliers to the main chains been asked to contribute to
'promotions' by the chain in question? If you do not play ball they delist
your product. How many times have packers agreed a programme, and been
issued a contract by the buyer, only to receive a call a few days or weeks
later to be told by the supermarket that it has been quoted lower prices
elsewhere and wishes to renegotiate the contract. This after the supplier
has committed itself to labels, packaging materials, cans, fruit or
vegetables. The supplier can either agree, which will often mean that his
very slim profit margin goes, or, he can tell the buyer that he has a court
case on his hands. It is easy to guess what happens in real life.
The five supermarket chains will shrink to four, then quite possibly to
three. Meanwhile, just study the margin of profit over the last few years of
the chains, up from 1 per cent to over 6 per cent. It is the suppliers who,
in the process, have felt the screw.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: Economic, not just monetary, objectives must be
defined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN JESSOP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The number of column inches dedicated to a commentary on the economy
never ceases to amaze me. The cost to the Fleet Street 'enlightened' press
must exceed all other budgets. Yet these commentaries say nothing in
relation to identifying the real problems of the UK economy. Furthermore, if
this is anyway representative of the advice give to government by its own
advisers then it is no wonder that we are in the state we find ourselves.
The simple fact is that we do not have an economic strategy; what we have is
simply a monetary policy, nothing more, nothing less.
There is no doubt that we need an economic strategy, but before we can
define one we must look to our goals and objectives in relation to the
short, medium and long term. Since, I assume, it is vital to have a
successful manufacturing sector we must define relevant objectives. I would
assume it is equally important to define the market areas in which we would
like our manufacturing to be active - eg clothes pegs or aeroplanes.
If we pursue this course then it is vital, for obvious reasons, that
government and industry have close dialogue. Equally, since the banks are a
vital player within the economy they must be involved in strategic
decisions. Witness the creation of vast acres of worthless property assets
in London alone.
If we want a strong currency, and it is the declared objective of our prime
minister, then we must first build a strong economy. The government's role
is quite simple; it has been elected to lead and so it should pull industry
and banking together, define an economic strategy and get the country
moving.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: Economics of village opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Royal Opera House serves a useful function as the village hall of
the richer members of the London City village community.
You seem to be seeking to consolidate the position of the Financial Times as
the newspaper of this little community when you urge the government to
contribute 'perhaps Pounds 15m' to the cost of refurbishing the Opera House,
and suggest that the spirit of the Falklands war should be employed to
ensure that the hall need not be closed for long ('Brooke's Opera', October
5).
There are many village halls in the UK, and many of them have outdated
facilities. Do you believe that every village community is entitled to
government grants to refurbish their halls? In the FT's other guise, as a
newspaper that comments on economic policy, perhaps it could consider the
criteria that should determine government finance for village halls.
As it stands, you seem to believe that the criterion should be: 'To him who
hath shall be given.'

FT  10 OCT 92 / Is anybody out there?: An ambitious search for alien life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday, the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the New World by
Christopher Columbus, the US space agency Nasa will start mankind's first
systematic search for extra-terrestrial intelligence.
Seti is a mainstream scientific enterprise, not to be confused with the
fringe activities of UFO hunters. Most astronomers believe that intelligent
life must be widespread elsewhere in the universe and that Seti has a fair
chance of detecting its existence. Such a discovery could be the most
significant scientific event in human history.
The project will use the world's most powerful radio-telescopes, combined
with computerised analysis, to search for artificial signals from alien
life.
On Monday afternoon, Nasa astronomer Jill Tarter will switch on the
300-metre dish at Arecibo in Puerto Rico at the same moment as her colleague
Sam Gulkis activates the 34-metre antenna at Goldstone, California. Within a
month the two antennae will have scanned the sky millions of times more
thoroughly than all previous searches.
The Seti story started in 1960 when Professor Frank Drake tuned his
radio-telescope to a nearby star which, he thought, might have a planetary
system capable of sustaining life. Since then, astronomers have carried out
about 50 individual Seti projects and detected some intriguing signals, but
no clear message from extra-terrestrial life.
Seti supporters are not dismayed by their failure so far, because the
methods used have been rudimentary compared with Nasa's new survey which
uses microwaves - high frequency radio waves. Prof Drake, still the leading
enthusiast, confidently expects an extra-terrestrial signal to be picked up
within 10 years. John Billingham, head of the Seti office at Nasa's Ames
Research Centre in California, says cautiously: 'It's not unreasonable to
think we might detect something.'
Sir Francis Graham-Smith of Britain's Jodrell Bank observatory, which has
helped carry out preparatory research for Seti, is more doubtful. 'The odds
are pretty heavily against hearing a real squeak,' he says. 'But I admire
people who are prepared to dedicate so much of their lives to Seti.'
Recent scientific discoveries support the view that the universe is full of
life. Astronomers now believe billions of other stars have planets like our
solar system. And simple organic molecules, similar to the chemical building
blocks of terrestrial life, are distributed widely through interstellar
space.
'Given enough time and favourable environmental conditions, biological
complexity and intelligence may also have evolved in many locations,' says
Bob Arnold of Nasa. 'If only one site in a thousand has developed
intelligence and technology, there may now be about 10m advanced
civilisations in our galaxy.'
That may be a wild overestimate. Even so, few astronomers believe we are the
only technologically advanced species in our galaxy.
Of all the uncertainties involved in estimating the number of
extra-terrestrial civilisations, the most uncertain is knowing how long they
last on average. Is it a consequence of natural evolution that intelligent
life tends to destroy itself through warfare and/or pollution, soon after it
has mastered the technology to communicate across the galaxy? If so, there
may be only a handful of civilisations in existence at any one time.
On the other hand, if the universe really is teeming with advanced life, why
have we not picked up its signals already? Possibly because the cleanest and
more efficient medium of interstellar communication is not radio but
something our primitive human minds have not yet thought of.
But, with our present technology, searching by radio is the only practical
option. Although Seti astronomers have no idea where in the sky to point
their receivers, they can make an educated guess about the channels likely
to be used for interstellar messages. The Nasa project is concentrating on
the portion of the microwave spectrum which suffers least from natural
background noise.
Over the next 10 years, the scientists plan to use nine radio-telescopes
around the globe to carry out two linked searches. The 'targeted search'
will examine 1,000 individual stars within 100 light-years of earth,
selected for their similarity to our sun. The 'sky survey' will scan the
whole heavens, with a less sensitive resolution.
Computers will process the radio output at a rate equivalent to millions of
words per second. They are programmed to pick out any pattern not
corresponding to signals from known astronomical processes or human
communications.
Man-made interference is a growing problem, as satellite and earth-based
microwave transmissions steadily obliterate the channels chosen for Seti.
'Daily the task becomes more difficult,' Nasa says.
If Nasa does detect an alien signal through the buzz of human communications
it will follow the Seti code of conduct drawn up by the International
Academy of Astronautics. There will be no public announcement until an
international panel of scientists has verified the finding.
What happens then depends on the nature of the signal. Most exciting would
be a 'we are here' message, deliberately transmitted by an alien species
trying to make contact with intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy. It
would presumably be based on universal mathematical or physical constants,
for simple decoding.
But if we were eavesdropping on signals transmitted for other purposes - for
example the extra-terrestrial equivalent of the radio waves which have been
leaking out from earth for the past 50 years from television broadcasts and
radars - human scientists might not be able to extract any detailed
information from them.
Under the Seti code, no reply can be broadcast unless political leaders have
agreed on its contents through the United Nations. One can imagine an
impassioned debate, weighing the benefits of learning from more advanced
creatures against the risks of alerting them to our existence.
We would be insulated by an inbuilt time delay. Each message would take tens
or hundreds of years to cross interstellar space, and it would take the
aliens far longer than that physically to reach us unless they have learned
to travel at the speed of light. Even so, the fate of the indigenous
inhabitants of the New World after 1492 might provide an awful warning about
the dangers of contact with a more advanced civilisation.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: BIL's Gibbs Mew bid lapses after purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brierley Investments' Pounds 11m hostile bid for Gibbs Mew, which hinged on
the target's acquisition of a wholesale drinks distributor not being
approved, lapsed last night as Gibbs shareholders gave their blessing to the
UK D purchase.
In the Salisbury-based brewing and commercial property group's extraordinary
meeting the resolution to approve the acquisition was passed. Irrevocable
undertakings for 51.9 per cent of Gibbs Mew's equity had been received by
September 23. Gibbs Mew is 59 per cent family-owned.
UK D is to be bought for an initial Pounds 2.33m in loan notes and shares
with a further profits-related consideration of Pounds 540,000 in shares.
In July when BIL, which holds stakes in Budgens, the supermarket chain,
Alvis, the defence contractor, and Mount Charlotte, the hotels group, mooted
launching a bid for the 80.3 per cent of Gibbs Mew that it did not already
own, it made several pre-conditions. They included Gibbs Mew's activities
continuing as normal, making no disposals or acquisitions and not issuing or
allotting any shares.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Irish government to sell ACCBank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government has put up for sale ACCBank, a banking network of 45
branches with deposits of IPounds 535m, a loan book of IPounds 482m and
total assets worth IPounds 741m.
The price tag was thought to be in the region of IPounds 60m, or Pounds
62.7m. The finance ministry said 'all interested parties will be given an
opportunity to bid'.
It had also reiterated its intention to sell another state bank known as
ICCBank, which had been on the market for two years. 'A decision to sell
these bodies will depend on the sale terms being acceptable to the
government,' the ministry said.
ACCBank recently reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 3.6m for the first half
of 1992, and had strengthened considerably since its restructuring in 1987,
when it suffered substantial losses. The bank was originally established by
the state in the 1920s to provide loans exclusively to the agricultural
sector, but now trades as an ordinary high street bank. ICC Bank is an
industrial credit institution and was thought to have a price tag in the
region of IPounds 40m.
The branch network and loan book of ACCBank will be a valuable addition to a
number of Irish financial institutions looking to extend their banking
operations in the republic. The most interested contenders were thought to
be Woodchester/Credit Lyonnais, Ulster Bank, Irish Permanent Building
Society, and the National Irish Bank.

Pre-tax profits of IFG Group fell from IPounds 820,000 to IPounds 486,000,
or Pounds 508,000 at current exchange rates, for the half year ended June 30
1992.
The core financial businesses in life, pensions, investment and mortgage
brokerage performed well for this Dublin-based group.
Market conditions in the UK and Ireland had an adverse affect on the results
of the investment in the engineering sector, Mr Joe Moran, the chairman,
said. Those conditions also affected IFG International's corporate and
trustee business.
Earnings per share dropped from 2.25p to 1.03p.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Near Pounds 1m turnround at Trace Computers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trace Computers, which provides consultancy services, continued in profit
for the second half to produce an overall Pounds 502,000 pre-tax for the
year ended May 31 1992, compared with a loss of Pounds 471,000.
Although some of the operating centres were standing up well to the
recession, others continued to be affected, said Mr Robert Carefull, the
chairman.
Turnover dipped to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 19.7m) but actions to reduce costs
and focus more on software activities led to an improvement of Pounds 1m in
operating profit.
Good performances came from core businesses of insurance broking, property,
distribution, and stockbroking systems, and bespoke software.
The chairman said Prospect, the recruitment and consultancy company,
suffered from low demand and also incurred a significant loss on bad debt
after the failure of a large customer. It should return to profitability
this year.
Earnings per share came to 2.94p (losses 1.98p). The final dividend is again
0.9p for a maintained 1.45p total.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As there are currently favourable opportunities for investment in emerging
markets, Beta Global Emerging Markets Investment Trust is seeking to raise
Pounds 13.5m net through a placing and open offer.
Some Pounds 10.5m will come from a placing of 10.8m C shares at 100p, and an
additional Pounds 2.97m from an offer of 3m C shares to existing share and
warrant holders.
Net proceeds and the investments made with them will initially be accounted
for as a separate pool of assets. The net asset value of existing ordinary
shares will be unaffected by the introduction of C shares.
The C shares will convert into ordinary, with new warrants being allotted on
the basis of 1-for-5, either when at least 80 per cent of the assets
attributable to the C shares have been invested, or on May 28 next if
earlier.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aberdeen Steak Houses, the restaurant chain, made a significant reduction to
its first half losses and forecasts a return to profitability in the second
half.
From turnover of Pounds 5.78m in the six months ended June 30, against
Pounds 5.72m, the loss before tax came to Pounds 408,000 (Pounds 629,000).
Losses per share were unchanged at 3p.
Ongoing branches produced turnover of Pounds 5.57m (Pounds 5.15m) and
trading losses of Pounds 242,000 (Pounds 418,000). The pre-tax deficit took
account of utilising Pounds 220,000 (Pounds 428,000) of previous provisions
against discontinuing branches.

<TEXT>
AS AN END to the recession was not apparent and further cost reductions were
unlikely to make any impact until next year, A Cohen is again reducing its
dividend in 'the interests of financial prudence'.
Following the cut of 13.1p in last year's final, the current interim payment
is being reduced from 6.6p to 3.4p, costing Pounds 55,000 (Pounds 107,000).
For the first half of 1992 this maker of non-ferrous metal ingots saw its
pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 555,000 to Pounds 496,000, on turnover down
from Pounds 41.2m to Pounds 38.1m. Earnings per share were 1.18p (8.97p).
The company said that although there were modest improvements in some
sections they were offset by worsening conditions in others.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar beats off predator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG LAND has only increased its stake in Trafalgar House by a
negligible amount after its tender offer closed yesterday afternoon.
Hongkong Land, which recently bought a 14.9 per cent stake, was unable to
push its holding above 15 per cent. It will formally announce the result on
Monday.
The colony's leading property and development group hoped to take its stake
up to 29.9 per cent.
Directors at Trafalgar, where the board will meet on Monday to discuss the
issue, said the result vindicated their arguments that their property,
construction and engineering group was worth considerably more than the 85p
a share offered by Hongkong Land.
They also said they were delighted with the loyalty shown by shareholders.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, and Mr Henry Keswick, chairman
of Jardine Matheson Holdings, which controls a third of Hongkong Land, are
expected to seek a meeting with Sir Nigel Broackes and Sir Eric Parker,
Trafalgar's chairman and chief executive respectively.
The Keswicks are still hoping for representation on Trafalgar's board and
are expected to tell Trafalgar's directors that their international contacts
could help the group secure further contracts.
They are also expected to argue that they have strengthened the group by
underpinning the price of Trafalgar's shares through their offer price of
85p a share.
One item for discussion will be Trafalgar's hotels which Trafalgar is trying
to sell. The Keswicks are expected to argue that the group no longer needs
to make what appears to be distressed sales. Trafalgar, however, is unlikely
to feel under any pressure to heed the Keswicks's wishes.
Nonetheless, some of the group's shareholders yesterday said Trafalgar
should not interpret their decision not to sell in the tender offer as an
endorsement of the group's strategy and management. Trafalgar's shareholders
did not believe that 85p a share represented good value. Many are waiting to
see whether Hongkong Land continues to try and buy more shares or launches a
full bid.
The ordinary shares closed yesterday at 85 1/2 p and the A shares at 82 1/2
p.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ulster TV interim boost to Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 17 per cent increase in advertising revenue boosted Ulster Television's
pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.79m in the six months to June 30, compared with
Pounds 134,000.
Mr John McGuckian, chairman, said the advertising increase was the highest
in independent television and had improved its share of the market.
He added that despite continued uncertainty over the economy 'the full year
should show a revenue increase ahead of the industry average'.
Net advertising revenue was Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 10.8m) with total turnover
of Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 11.4m). Profits were further boosted by a lower
Exchequer Levy of Pounds 90,000 (Pounds 299,000) and higher investment
income of Pounds 534,000 (Pounds 382,000).
Earnings per share were 10.22p (0.76p) and the interim dividend has been
increased from 3.25p to 4.25p.
Ulster, which in April appointed Television Sales and Marketing Services to
sell its airtime, bid Pounds 1.03m a year in 1993 prices to retain its
licence against two rivals.
Mr McGuckian said yesterday that preparations for the new 10-year licence
period were well advanced including the building of a new studio for a daily
one-hour news and information programme at 6pm.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Lamont shares dip sharply after 44% profits
shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Lamont Holdings, the Northern Ireland-based carpets and textiles
group, fell yesterday by 65p to 238p after the group reported a 44 per cent
decline in interim pre-tax profits accompanied by a somewhat gloomy
assessment of the market from Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 dropped from Pounds 3.92m to
Pounds 2.18m as turnover in the main carpet division declined by 13 per cent
and margins came under severe pressure.
Earnings fell to 5.61p (10.55p) per share, but the interim dividend is being
maintained at 3.5p on capital increased by the June rights issue, costing
Pounds 1.05m (Pounds 830,000).
Mr Richard Milliken, chief executive, expressed surprise about the share
price drop which he said appeared to be a market 'over-reaction.'
He said most of the decline in profits stemmed from the difficult conditions
faced by the Shaw Carpets subsidiary which had suffered 'quite significant'
trading losses.
In his comments Sir Desmond said there had been 'no improvement in trading
conditions,' noting that the recession had continued 'bringing with it an
increasing lack of confidence on the part of the consumer, particularly in
the UK domestic market.'
As a result turnover dropped by 6 per cent to Pounds 52.6m (Pounds 56.1m)
and trading profits fell by 42 per cent to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 3.86m).
Sir Desmond said 'the absence of any buoyancy in consumer spending impacted
very harshly on our carpet manufacturing activities.'
Turnover in that division dropped to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 25m) and margins,
particularly in the extremely competitive middle market range, were 'very
badly affected.' Overall the division made a modest Pounds 81,000 (Pounds
1.51m) trading profit.
The impact of the recession was felt most severely at Shaw Carpets, while
Northern Ireland Carpets managed to return a reasonable profit in difficult
circumstances.
Sir Desmond warned that the continuance of trading losses at Shaw 'will not
be tolerated by management who are vigorously looking at ways of dealing
with these current trading difficulties.'

<TEXT>
JOHNSTON GROUP, the civil and mechanical engineer, yesterday continued its
loss making run, as its late 1980s foray into property continued to hit
performance.
The group fell to an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 765,000 (profits of
Pounds 1.25m). At the operating level Johnston barely broke even.
Losses per share were 7.52p, against earnings of 5.22p. The interim dividend
is bing cut from 4.5p to 2.25p.
Mr Graham Johnston, chairman, said that most of the group's markets had been
adversely affected by reduced demand and tighter margins.
The group said it would review the value of development properties at the
year end and that a further revaluation was likely. Rental values had fallen
since a Pounds 4m exceptional provision was made last December.
The contracting and construction division was hit by the Caribbean
activities which had what Mr Brian Deller, the finance director, called a
'horrendous first half'.
The building materials division was 25 per cent lower than last year.
However the sweeper activities, helped by significant export orders, had a
much improved profit.
Mr Deller said that in the short term trading conditions looked bleak.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Blystad directors fight takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT directors at Blystad Group are continuing their rearguard action
to thwart Mr Alistair Locke's takeover of the oil service group that has
paid no dividend for seven years.
The directors yesterday recommended that minority holders reject the offer
from Mr Locke's private company, Abbot Holdings, which declared its Pounds
7.5m bid for Blystad unconditional this week.
In a letter to shareholders they said Mr Locke's unquoted redeemable
preference shares in place of the quoted Blystad shares were a 'totally
inadequate substitute.'
Mr Locke will gain management control after three of the Norwegian Blystad
family directors, who control 62 per cent of the shares, accepted the offer.
Blystad shareholders were being asked to give up shares in a company with
real assets for shares in an unquoted company with no assets, the letter
said.
Furthermore, any payment on Abbot's preference shares would have to be
funded from Blystad's own resources. 'As an existing shareholder in Blystad
you already own those assets and any profits they generate,' the letter
said.
The rearguard action threatens to prevent Mr Locke from being able to take
Blystad private to sort out a group that has one of the rockier history's in
the offshore oil industry.
A high level of rejection of the offer will leave Mr Locke with an expensive
public quote to maintain and a potentially obstructive minority shareholder
base who have probably already written off the value of their shares.
Blystad shares closed yesterday at 1 1/2 p.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: MAI sells Avenir stake to French parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAI, the financial services and media combine, is accepting an offer from
Havas, the French media group, for its 15.2 per cent stake in Avenir Havas
Media, the outdoor advertising group.
MAI will receive convertible bonds with a nominal value of Pounds 40m which
are redeemable in 1997 for Pounds 51m, giving a yield to redemption of 7.7
per cent. The deal would add Pounds 24m to MAI's net worth, taking it to
Pounds 198m.
Havas has made the same offer to other minority holders in Avenir, in which
it has a near 56 per cent stake.
The bonds will bear a 3 per cent coupon and be publicly listed.
Lord Hollick, managing director of MAI, said the sale would boost MAI's
post-tax income, as the coupon on the bonds would exceed the dividend the
group had been receiving from its Avenir shares.
In pre-tax terms the sale would lock in a level of profit - on the 7.7 per
cent yield - higher than the Pounds 2.2m contribution made in the year to
June when profits at Avenir were depressed.
The sale would take MAI's net cash to about Pounds 150m. Lord Hollick said
the group was in the middle of a Pounds 75m investment programme, which
includes spending on Meridian, the TV company which starts broadcasting in
January.
The stake in Avenir dates back to 1989 when MAI and Havas each injected
their media interests into it.
At the time MAI held a 36 per cent interest, which was reduced through sales
in 1990 and 1991. This disposal will take the total proceeds from
advertising to Pounds 200m.
MAI's accounts, published yesterday, show that Lord Hollick's remuneration
during the year was Pounds 426,000, up from Pounds 348,000 the previous
year, and nearly returning to the Pounds 439,000 he received in 1990.
Havas yesterday denied that it had been building up a stake in Hachette, the
heavily-indebted French media group, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Hachette claimed on Thursday that Havas had been buying its shares.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock market's
regulatory body, said it was investigating dealings inHachette shares, which
rose sharply mid-week but fell back on Friday on Havas' denial.

FT  10 OCT 92 / The couch potato campaign: From 'infomercials' to Ross
Perot's favourite chat show, television now makes the running in
presidential elections. Jurek Martin reports on the eve of the first
Bush-Clinton TV debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATCHING tomorrow night's presidential debate on television will be a
professional duty and it might be very interesting. There is a chance, if
not tomorrow then at one of the other two scheduled debates in the next 10
days, that somebody will say something that will determine who inherits the
White House on November 3. After all, many millions of Americans will be
watching, between digesting their dinners and anticipating the next round in
the baseball play-offs.
However, honesty requires the confession that this year's long campaign has
required altogether too much couch potato life. Televised debates, of
course, have been a feature since 1960, in primaries and down the home
stretch, but at least they were interspersed with a lot of travel around the
country, with or without the candidates themselves.
This is still possible and desirable, except that this year it has been
harder than ever to avoid, from dawn to after midnight, the need to keep
half an eye on the box. The difference is that the eye is no longer looking
for the telling soundbite or attack advertising or even the substantive
interview on the big networks, but for an extended exposition of a
candidate's views on everything from life, love and free trade to
contraception.
Ross Perot is to blame for this. Like a canny businessman he worked out that
some television is free, and, like a true populist, that a lot of people
watch and listen to programmes far removed from mainstream news and current
affairs in the evenings and on Sunday mornings.
So he promulgated his prospective candidacy on his favourite talk show
programme, Larry King Live, which broadcasts on CNN.
He explained why he was getting out in July to Mr King, ruminated about a
re-entry with Mr King, and justified it not only to Mr King but over the
breakfast table.
This week alone, according to an informal count, President George Bush has
appeared twice on Mr King's evening show and three times on ABC's Good
Morning America. Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore, the inseparable
ones, have appeared once with Mr King and once with Phil Donahue, whose
daytime show caters mostly for housewives with problems, while Mr Clinton
has appeared alone on NBC's Today. Mr Bush has said he would never do
Donahue, but nobody is betting on that now.
Mr Perot, nothing if not unpredictable, has temporarily forsaken his old
beat, now offering paid-for - and widely watched - 'infomercials' instead of
enduring the cross-questioning from the journalists whom, Mr King apart, he
so patently dislikes. But his half-hour on one channel on Tuesday night cost
him upwards of Dollars 350,000.
This extension of political discourse from the conventional political
programmes to those which still often resemble freak shows should be seen as
encouraging. It may not be the exercise in democracy that Plato or the
Founding Fathers contemplated, but at least it is an exercise. Televised
'town meetings' are also now a standard campaign tool.
Much onus is placed on the hosts themselves. Mr King, a gravel-voiced
Brooklynite, has been plying his trade for years, but never with such
prominence. This year he has been notably pally with Mr Perot, deferential
to Mr Bush (though not to the point of taking off his trademark braces and
putting on a jacket) and accommodating to Messrs Clinton and Gore. He sees
himself more as a conduit than a pundit, though the frequency of his
interviews with those seeking the highest office threaten to turn him into
the latter.
Much sharper questioning has been forthcoming from Bryant Gumbel and Katie
Couric, who preside over NBC's chatty early morning Today programme. Mr
Gumbel may be as good an interrogator as American television now possesses
and Ms Couric, though less experienced, has her moments. The refusal of both
to bow down to Mr Perot's tirades about the political establishment, of
which he considers the professional media a part, has been conspicuously
admirable.
Mr Donahue performs with a studio audience, as, occasionally, does Mr King,
and is practised at playing to it. He has a tendency to preach and was
firmly rebuked by Mr Clinton this week for going on at length about what the
Democratic candidate may have done in the anti-war movement while a student
at Oxford many years ago.
For Mr Clinton and Mr Perot, as challengers, recourse to the new medium and
its studios has presented few problems. Mr Bush, however, likes to stand on
the dignity of the presidency and prefers sessions to be conducted live, or
taped, in the White House, sometimes in the presence of his wife.
None of this will matter tomorrow, when all three will be on a carefully
constructed podium in Kansas City. On Thursday, the names of the
interrogatory team were announced. Acceptable to the candidates were the
moderator, Jim Lehrer, co-host of public television's excellent evening news
hour, and three panelists, one writing journalist, one television reporter
and one who has done both (actually, many writing luminaries also spend a
lot of time talking on television these days).
There was no room, at least not the first time around, for Messrs King,
Donahue and Gumbel or Ms Couric (some of whom might have refused in any
case). Perhaps the revolution in television politics still has a way to run.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UN agrees Bosnia air ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council yesterday approved a ban on military flights in the
air space of Bosnia-Hercegovina and threatened future enforcement action if
the resolution was violated.
The UN Protection Force (Unprofor) in Yugoslavia will monitor compliance by
stationing observers at airfields throughout the former federation.
The council's decision, adopted by 14 votes to 0 with China abstaining, came
after a week of intense negotiations. The US agreed with Britain and France
on a compromise text, having previously sought immediate council authority
for the downing of Serb aircraft that contravened the ban.
What could be a two-stage programme has now been created, with the council
committed by the resolution to 'consider urgently the further measures
necessary to enforce this ban if it is contravened'.
UN and EC observers will monitor the implementation, which is expected to be
rapid, and will include the use of satellites, radar-equipped AWACs and
other reconnaissance aircraft.
The ban went into effect the instant the resolution was adopted.
Sir David Hannay, the UK delegate, warned: 'Anybody who believes this ban
can be flouted without their being noticed is in for a nasty surprise.'
Meanwhile, it was reported that Serb and Croat leaders from
Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday agreed to a ceasefire, indicating that the two
leaders are pushing through their programme of dividing the republic at the
expense of the Moslems.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serb forces, and Mr Mate Boban,
his Croatian counterpart, while attending peace talks in Geneva, agreed to
an unconditional ceasefire, the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency said
yesterday in a report which was later denied by Mr Karadzic.
Meanwhile, Sarajevo radio yesterday reported a strong Bosnian
counter-offensive around Brcko and Gradacac, in northern Bosnia.

FT  10 OCT 92 / US queries Japanese computer decision

THE Japanese government fears that US criticism of the country's
supercomputer procurement methods will lead to Japan becoming a target of
trade anger during the final weeks of the US election campaign.
The two countries signed a supercomputer pact in 1990 that was supposed to
end almost a decade of disagreement over Japanese government procurement
practices. The Bush administration had seen the agreement as an important
achievement for its trade strategy with Japan.
However, a decision by Japan's education ministry to award a supercomputer
contract to NEC, the Japanese electronics company, over the US maker Cray
Research, and a further decision by a government procurement review board to
uphold that award have created new friction between Japan and the US.
Mr John Rollwagen, chairman of Cray, who is visiting Tokyo, said yesterday
he was disappointed by the panel's decision, but was unsure what further
redress his company would have in Japan.
Meanwhile, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, has asked her
department to study the review board's finding, and said she has 'serious
concerns' about the decision, which is the first handed down by the
newly-established panel.
'The review board process is an important test of the Japanese government's
resolve to fully implement the provisions of the 1990 supercomputer
agreement. We therefore want to review its report and scrutinise carefully
the steps taken to reach this decision,' Mrs Hills said.
The supercomputer in dispute was ordered by the ministry's institute for
fusion sciences, and Cray alleged that the institute fashioned the
specifications to suit NEC and leaked information to the company. NEC denies
this.
Mr Rollwagen claimed yesterday that his company's supercomputer was superior
to the NEC product, and that under normal bidding conditions, should have
been selected by the institute.

JAPAN'S leaders yesterday tried to bolster fragile business confidence by
declaring that about 70 per cent of the Y10,700bn (Pounds 50bn) emergency
package announced in August was ready to be implemented.
However, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, warned that the economy was
still weakening, while Mr Michio Watanabe, international trade and industry
minister, said the economy would start to regain its strength next summer.
The government is concerned that the initial euphoria which buoyed the stock
market after the August announcement may be wearing off. Business leaders
this week raised doubts about whether the huge programme of public works in
the package could be implemented by next March, the end of the fiscal year.
Despite the scale of the public effort to support the economy, the
government is under increasing pressure from within the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party as well as outside it, to consider a further fiscal
stimulus in the 1993 budget.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said steady progress was being made
in implementing the plan.
Public money is pouring into the Japanese economy through a variety of
channels, many of them not obvious.
Public works worth about Y3,900bn are to be implemented sooner than planned.
The Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, which has deposits of more than
Y32,000bn had already invested an additional Y800bn in the public sector
Housing Loan Corporation, helping to stimulate house construction. The
cabinet yesterday lowered the interest rate on those loans. About Y300bn has
been provided for public corporations such as the Japan Highway Public
Corporation and the Housing and Urban Development Corporation.
Local government budgets have been increased substantially to meet their
target of Y1,800bn extra spending. The supplementary budget for the 47
prefectural governments has been increased to Y812.9bn, more than twice the
previous record high of Y357.5bn last year.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Standard sues over Bombay scandal
</HEADLINE>

STANDARD Chartered Bank, the British bank, yesterday stepped up its battle
to recover money it lost in the Rs35bn Bombay securities market scandal by
filing a fraud claim against Citibank, the US bank which was also active in
the Indian capital markets.
In a claim filed yesterday in New York, Standard Chartered is suing Citibank
for Rs1.16bn (Pounds 24m), alleging fraud and breach of contract in
securities transactions in Bombay, between September 1991 and March 1992.
Citibank denies liability.
The scandal, which erupted in April, has resulted in about 15 arrests, the
resignation of a cabinet minister, the liquidation of two small Indian banks
and heavy losses at some other financial institutions, including Standard
Chartered, which says it lost Rs8.9bn.
The three sets of disputed transactions between Standard Chartered and
Citibank took place in the informal inter-bank securities market, which is
at the centre of the scandal.
According to the claim, Standard Chartered in each case, bought bonds from
Citibank , but the US bank did not deliver the underlying securities, since
transferring ownership of securities is cumbersome in Bombay. Instead, in
common with market practice, Citibank passed to Standard Chartered bankers'
receipts, which are written promises to deliver securities at a future date.
On one occasion, it also passed a Securities General Ledger (SGL) transfer
note, which is an instruction to the Reserve Bank of India, the central
bank, to transfer securities from one bank to another.
In the transactions central to the claim, the bankers' receipts and the SGL
note passed by Citibank to Standard Chartered were not issued by Citibank
but by affiliates of Canara Bank, a fast-growing Indian bank. Trading
third-party receipts and SGL notes was common practice. But Canara Bank's
affiliates apparently ran into difficulties and were unable to deliver the
securities to Standard Chartered.
Standard Chartered claims it paid Citibank for securities the US bank agreed
to deliver. It accuses Citibank of misrepresentation and, in the case of the
SGL note, knowingly passing a 'worthless' instrument. Citibank's case is
understood to be that Standard Chartered has no claim against Citibank, only
against the issuers of the bankers' receipts and SGL note.
Standard Chartered has separately filed a criminal complaint in India
alleging that it was defrauded by two former employees and a group of Indian
brokers and bankers. They deny the charges, which are being investigated by
government authorities.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Major takes pragmatic line on EC: Premier defends Maastricht
treaty but pledges to protect Britain's national identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday sought to rally his party behind his personal brand
of pragmatic Europeanism as the most turbulent Conservative conference since
the 1970s ended in a more traditional display of public unity.
In a closing speech designed to reconcile his determination to ratify the
Maastricht treaty with the implacable opposition of the Tory Euro-sceptics,
the prime minister pledged never to submerge Britain's national identity in
a Federal Europe.
But as he trod a careful line between the European enthusiasts and the
sceptics in his party, Mr Major warned that reneging on the Maastricht
agreement would mean 'breaking Britain's future in Europe'.
The speech came as colleagues in Brighton said that a cabinet debate about
whether sterling will rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism would be
re-opened when the treaty had been ratified.
In a relatively brief section of his speech devoted to the economy, Mr Major
made only a passing reference to the ERM. But Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, has told colleagues he is ready to consider re-entry next year
and several of the most senior members of the cabinet want to re-open the
issue in the spring or summer of 1993.
Without mentioning them by name, Mr Major dismissed the angry insistence of
Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit earlier this week that Maastricht represented
a blueprint for federalism. Accusing his opponents of tilting at windmills,
he said: 'It is time to return the debate to reality and away from myth.'
He then acknowledged the strength of opposition revealed by the emotive
debates at the conference by stressing that his approach was guided by a
single objective: 'a cold, clear-eyed calculation of the British national
interest.'
Reminding his audience of the dangers of division, Mr Major added: 'Unless
we stay united, unless we stand together, as a party and as a nation, this
country will never prevail.'
His speech, which won warm applause from an audience exhausted by a week of
public squabbling, was followed by confident forecasts from cabinet
colleagues that the Maastricht treaty would now be ratified by the House of
Commons.
But after a week which saw open warfare among Tory party activists and a
lukewarm reception for Mr Lamont's new economic strategy, ministers were
acknowledging that the divisions over Europe would not disappear.
The hard-core of Tory Euro-sceptics has promised a guerrilla war against the
legislation in the Commons which may ensure that the treaty is not fully
ratified until next spring.
Cabinet ministers meanwhile are themselves divided on whether Britain should
rejoin the ERM. The preference for managed exchange rates of Mr Douglas
Hurd, Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine is mirrored by the deep
antipathy of Mr Michael Howard, Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Michael Portillo.
Mr Major, who stressed the government's continuing commitment to low
inflation, tight control of public spending and low taxation, was
non-committal on the pace of economic recovery. But he emphasised that the
sharp fall in the value of the pound gave British exporters a new
'competitive edge' in Europe.
He signalled that the government would seek to ease the impact of a promised
squeeze on public spending by encouraging joint public-private sector
ventures to improve the nation's infrastructure. Mr Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, would also launch a drive to cut government regulation.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Inflation remains at 3.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEADLINE INFLATION was unchanged last month, but the underlying rate dropped
within the upper limit of the Treasury's new target range.
Official figures yesterday showed that the retail prices index rose by 3.6
per cent in the year to September, unchanged on the previous month. Although
this disappointed City expectations of a drop to 3.5 per cent, the
underlying measure - which excludes mortgage interest payments - fell to 4
per cent, its lowest level since March 1988.
Earlier this week, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced a target of
between 1 and 4 per cent for Britain's underlying inflation rate. Sluggish
economic conditions mean this rate is likely to continue falling for at
least another year.
The disinflationary momentum of the economy was further highlighted by news
that house prices fell on average by a record 3.1 per cent last month.
Halifax building society, which released the figures, said this was the
third consecutive monthly drop and the biggest since it began publishing an
index in 1983.
