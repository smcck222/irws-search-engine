FT  10 OCT 92 / Life company fined Pounds 50,000 for 'churning' client
policies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LIFE company Cannon Assurance has been fined Pounds 50,000 and ordered
to pay compensation for 'churning' customer policies, the first time
regulators have been able to prove such a charge.
Allegations of policy 'churning' have been rife in the life assurance
industry for years. Churning occurs when sales agents urge a client to cash
in an existing policy after a short time and replace it with another.
Cannon, based in Wembley, north London, has also been ordered to pay the
costs of the investigation, believed to be about Pounds 50,000.
Mr Eugene McCormack, the company's marketing director, declined to reveal
the cost of paying compensation to clients except to say: 'There were quite
a number of people involved.'
The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lincoln National Corporation, a
US financial services group based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. It has about
250,000 policies in force and Pounds 500m in assets under management. Lautro
said that Cannon had co-operated fully with the investigation, which covered
activities between June 1989 and June 1991, and said it had taken steps to
correct the problem.
For sales agents, churning is lucrative because they earn commission on each
new policy they sell. However, for clients, because such commissions are
deducted from the premiums paid in the initial years of a policy contract,
cancellations before maturity often result in losses.
'Churning is legendary within the industry but it is difficult to spot and
much more difficult to prove,' said Mr Michael Abrahams, head of compliance
at Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life assurance industry which
conducted the investigation and imposed the fine.
In the case of Cannon, regulators were able to spot churning because one
group of sales agents was said to have encouraged the clients of another
group of Cannon sales agents to cancel their existing policies.
Mr McCormack said the matter had come to the attention of Cannon's senior
management around the time of a Lautro review.
Lautro also found that Cannon had allowed individuals who had not yet been
formally licensed to sell its policies and had failed to monitor properly
the activities of its tied agents. Tied agents sell the products of one
company exclusively but are not employed by it directly.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Weak currencies rally as rates fears plague equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROLLERCOASTER week on financial markets ended yesterday with sterling, the
dollar and other weak currencies closing on a stronger note, while new
uncertainties plagued equity markets in Europe and the US.
Sterling gained more than 2 1/4 pfennigs, closing at DM2.5125 in London and
ending the week nearly 15 pfennigs higher than its low-point on Monday, when
the currency appeared to be on the verge of a free-fall. It continued to
strengthen in New York, where it closed at DM2.52.
But while foreign exchanges were calmer after last month's crisis in the
European exchange rate mechanism and Monday's turbulence, equities declined
in Tokyo, Paris and Frankfurt and on Wall Street.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed 2.4 higher at 2,541.2, from a peak of
2,566.8, as hopes faded of an early and substantial cut in UK interest
rates.
Although local issues affected individual centres, changing perceptions of
interest rate developments in Germany and the US proved to be a common
factor behind the latest fluctuations. There is a growing belief that the
Bundesbank will again cut official short-term interest rates because of the
need to stimulate growth. At the same time, a report in the Financial Times
yesterday said the US Federal Reserve was unlikely to cut its discount rate,
currently at 3 per cent, before the presidential election on November 3.
That report hit the US bond market, pushing the yield on the US Treasury
benchmark 30-year bond above 7.5 per cent. This in turn hit shares, with the
Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 39.45 to 3,136.58.
The perception that German rates are about to ease boosted the dollar,
sterling and the lira over the week. Yesterday, the dollar closed in London
at DM1.4855, nearly 8 pfennigs up on the week, and finished in New York at
DM1.488. The lira has firmed even more sharply, closing in London at L874.7,
12 per cent higher than its low point on Monday afternoon. In New York it
finished the day at L878.4.
Bundesbank reductions in the key rate at which it lends money to commercial
banks prompted dealers to believe that a cut in official rates is imminent,
with some suggesting it could come at next Thursday's Bundesbank council
meeting. There have also been signs of a slowdown in the German economy.
The bank has been injecting liquidity into the German money market at a
fixed rate of 8.9 per cent, 0.8 points below the level at which it was
operating a month ago. Technically, this would allow the Bundesbank to cut
its emergency Lombard rate by  1/2 a point without disrupting the structure
of market rates.
However, Miss Alison Cottrell, an international economics analyst at Midland
Montagu in London, said that the bank might wait until the end of the year
before cutting official rates.
Until yesterday, hopes of lower German rates helped continental European
stock markets to claw back most of Monday's falls, when fears about the
world economy prompted their biggest losses since the attempted coup in
Moscow in August last year. Yesterday, early losses on Wall Street depressed
French share prices while in Germany gloom about the economic outlook offset
hopes of lower interest rates.

FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Institutions support Andrews Sykes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO INSTITUTIONAL share-holders in Andrews Sykes, the industrial services
and environmental products group, said yesterday that they would vote
against a bid by a dissident minority shareholder to gain control of the
board.
Royal Insurance Asset Management (Riam), which holds an 8.19 per cent stake
in Andrews Sykes, and Postel Investment Management, which has a 4.71 per
cent stake, both said they would oppose moves by Mr Jacques Murray to take
control of the board at an extraordinary meeting called for next Friday.
Mr Murray holds a 26.6 per cent stake in Andrews Sykes through two
investment vehicles, European Fire Protection Holding and Midland Bank
Overseas Nominees. He has set down resolutions calling for the removal of Mr
David Hubbard, the chairman, and Mr David Crowe, a non-executive director,
from the five-man board and their replacement by himself and three of his
associates.
Both Riam and Postel said they strongly supported the existing board and
objected to the attempt by Mr Murray 'to gain control without making a
formal offer for the company.'
The statements coincided with a second letter to shareholders from Andrews
Sykes' management urging them to vote against Mr Murray's 'unnecessary and
unmerited' proposals.
Mr Andre Chudnoff, one of Mr Murray's associates, rejected the criticisms
and said the board had failed to address the main issue of its own financial
performance.

FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Investment cap spurs trust launch -
Frustrated Foreign &amp; Colonial acts over chancellor's refusal to change rules
on international funds / Company aims to reassure investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERSONAL equity plan rules which place a Pounds 1,500 limit on worldwide
investment and unit trusts have always seemed silly - and even more so since
the last Budget when Norman Lamont, the chancellor, raised the annual limit
on unit and investment trust Pep holdings from Pounds 3,000 to the full
Pounds 6,000 allowance for a general Pep.
But he did not abolish the Pounds 1,500 restriction, with the result that
Foreign &amp; Colonial's international general investment trust - the UK's
largest, with total assets of more than Pounds 1bn and strong performance -
remained limited to the Pounds 1,500 cap on funds with more than 50 per cent
of their equity holdings outside the UK and Europe.
Rather than tinker with the international trust, or wait any longer in the
hope of a change to the rules, Foreign &amp; Colonial launched a new trust this
week: the PEP investment trust (Pepit).
Foreign &amp; Colonial has eschewed the recent trend of choosing a split capital
structure. Instead, the trust has a simple capital structure, with investors
being offered ordinary shares at 100p during the offer period which closes
on October 23.
The initial charge will be 2.5 per cent, which compares favourably with
M&amp;G's Recovery and Income investment trusts, launched within the past 13
months, which are more than 5 per cent. The annual management charge is 0.4
per cent.
Pepit will invest initially in a spread of 50-55 companies, with
three-quarters of the portfolio held in FT-SE 100 stocks. There will be
around 10 holdings in Europe in large companies such as Bayer, the German
chemicals company, Siemens, the German computer group, and L'Oreal, the
cosmetics company. The rest of the portfolio will be invested in non-FTSE
stock such as Emap, the media group, and some of the smaller water
companies.
Foreign &amp; Colonial is hoping that nervous investors will be reassured by the
dominance of FT-SE 100 stock. 'Companies of this stature are, in general, of
the size and strength to withstand the current difficult economic
situation,' says F&amp;C's Jeremy Tigue. But the 103-point drop in the FTSE
index on Monday will have done little to entice those with worries about the
market's volatility. The uncertain economic climate caused two investment
trust launches - from Touche Remnant and Schroder Investment Management - to
be postponed this week.
Tigue. however, sees the weak market as the time to invest. 'The present
turbulent conditions offer some excellent buying opportunities and value on
a long-term view - and, indeed, Foreign &amp; Colonial's performance is based on
our philosophy of buying steadily and cautiously into value into precisely
such conditions.'
The main attraction for most private clients is being able to put the full
Pounds 6,000 into a broadly spread Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trust Pep.
Only two of F&amp;C's eight investment trusts - the German and the European -
qualified for the full allowance. But these are specialised markets unlikely
to appeal to most private investors.
When F&amp;C introduced its Pep last year, investors in the international trust
could place only the Pounds 1,500. F&amp;C put the remaining Pounds 4,500 into a
blue chip portfolio of five UK shares: BT, BTR, BAT, Lloyds Bank and Shell.
These investors are being invited by F&amp;C to transfer their Pep into Pepit,
and more than 40 per cent have said they will. The charges for Pepit follow
the same flat fee structure as for the existing plan. These are an initial
fee of Pounds 50 plus VAT - waived during the offer period - and Pounds 5
plus VAT per month for administration.
If you invest only Pounds 2,000, the annual flat fee works out at an
expensive 3.5 per cent. But the advantage of a flat fee over a percentage is
that the proportion of your investment deducted in charges falls as you put
in more money.
So, should investors who do not have a general Pep for this year choose
Pepit?
Like other equity-based investment, those wanting returns should view the
trust as a long-term commitment. On that basis, Peter Walls, investment
trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, is enthusiastic. 'This is the ideal
product for private investors, coming from a blue chip management group that
has clearly demonstrated its ability in the investment trust sector. It is
the sort of expansion of the sector that I welcome.'
Those seeking a high income may be disappointed, though. F&amp;C says Pepit will
be balanced between capital growth and income and the estimated yield, at
4.5 per cent, is below the present market average of around 5 per cent. But
Walls points out that, in the present climate of dividend cuts, high income
trusts are having to sacrifice capital growth and performance in order to
pay out income.
Investors in Pepit can choose to have income reinvested or to take the
income twice a year tax free.
Should investors subscribe to the trust during the offer period? The
conventional problem for a company launching an investment trust is that
shares in them often trade at a discount. F&amp;C says it expects Pepit to trade
at a premium after the offer period because of high demand, but it has an
interest in persuading people to invest now.
Walls agrees that there should be a high level of demand for the trust
because of a shortage of high-quality, broad-based investment trust Peps. He
expects it to trade at or near its net asset value and, therefore, favours
going in during the offer period to avoid paying 0.5 per cent stamp duty and
broker's commission, as well as taking advantage of the initial Pep charge
waiver.
Some investors may wish to wait to and see how the fund performs. Although
F&amp;C has proved itself as an international fund manager - with growth of 218
per cent in its international general trust in the seven years to October 1
according to Finstat - the UK is a relatively unproven area for F&amp;C's fund
managers.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Pirelli Tyre Holding (PTH), the Amsterdam-quoted tyres subsidiary
of Italy's Pirelli tyres and cables group, fell sharply yesterday on news of
a plan to double its share capital.
PTH, which is 79 per cent of owned by its italian parent, intends to double
its equity by raising Fl 465m (Dollars 292.4m) in a one-for-one rights
issue, priced at the stock's nominal value of Fl 10 a share. Shares in PTH
were originally sold at Fl 54 when the company was floated in June 1989.
Shares in PTH, fell Fl 9.60 to Fl 11.50 from Thursday's closing price of Fl
21.10, amid highly critical comments by Dutch analysts. 'It's like a gun
being pointed at the heads of (outside) shareholders,' said Mr Richard
Brakenhoff, at Pierson, Heldring and Pierson, the Dutch merchant bank.
Pirelli in Milan justified the deal on the grounds that recapitalising PTH
would raise much-needed cash to cut debts and interest charges. Additional
funds would also be required to finance investment in new products and more
efficient plant.
Subscribing to the new shares in full will cost outside shareholders Fl
96.7m. However, Pirelli made clear it would underwrite the entire issue if
necessary.
The Italian parent last month announced a return to profit with first-half
group net earnings of L77bn (Dollars 62.2m).
PTH reported a first-half loss of Fl 76.5m and expects further losses for
the rest of the year.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver stocks reported to be
insensitive to higher prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLDWIDE silver stocks are huge but only 1 per cent or 146m troy ounces
would be attracted into the market by prices up to Dollars 5 a troy ounce,
according to a study* by the Charles River Associates consultancy group. At
Dollars 10 a ounce, 541m ounces, or 2.8 per cent of total stocks, could
potentially enter the market, it suggests.
Even prices up to Dollars 20 an ounce would draw only 2.2bn ounces or 12
per cent out of stocks. It is also unlikely that stock would immediately
make its way to market but instead would be drawn out over some years if
higher silver prices prevailed, said Mr Firoze Katrak, Charles River
vice president.
This is believed to be the first assessment of worldwide silver stocks. It
was produced for the Washington-based Silver Institute, an international
association of silver miners, refiners, fabricators and manufacturers.
Mr Katrak strongly defended the independence of the study. While the
institute had set the terms of reference - the study was to estimate silver
stocks by type and geographical region and to estimate the liquidity of
those stocks in terms of the prices and conditions under which they would
flow into the market - the institute had no right to change the report in
any way.
The Charles Rivers organisation's reputation was at stake and, said Mr
Katrak: 'To use a vulgar analogy, a reputation is like virginity, you only
lose it once and we are not in this business to lose our virginity.'
The institute pointed out that fabrication demand for silver had exceeded
total supply for the past two years and a 50m ounce deficit was forecast for
1992. 'This demonstrates that, if nothing else changes, stocks available at
dollars five an ounce or less would be exhausted in about three years,' said
Mr Dennis Wheeler, president.
Analysts' immediate reaction to the long-awaited study was to suggest that
it would have a relatively neutral impact on the silver market. Mr George
Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said: 'It is bullish, but not
especially bullish.'
He said he wanted to examine the report to check the assumptions made about
silver stocks not available to the market. 'I am always worried when I am
told 84 per cent of stocks of anything are not available.' However, Mr
Milling-Stanley said the study was 'a very useful addition to the literature
of silver.'
The study suggests that the principal reasons stocks would not be drawn into
the market are:
Those held by investors, at 524m ounces, are less than 40 per cent of total
worldwide bullion stocks. Most bullion stocks are held largely as business
stocks which companies need for their normal operations. These business
stocks have generally been stable relative to consumption and not available
to the market except at very high silver prices and even then on a transient
basis;
Most coins and medallions are held either for their numismatic or
collectible value or as family holdings. Only a small portion is price
responsive and available to the market;
Most silverware and art forms of silver is not available under normal market
conditions largely because small holdings are spread among a vast number of
individuals who have a possessive or emotional attachment to them. Large
holdings are owned by churches or other religious groups or are held for the
high relative value of their art form, not for their silver content.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: New plan to settle TWA pensions
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE over the underfunded pension plans at Trans World Airlines, the
heavily-indebted carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, the former corporate
raider, took a new twist yesterday when the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation announced it had reached 'an understanding on key terms of an
agreement' with the bankrupt airline's unsecured creditors.
Under the outline deal, the carrier would issue a note covering 'a portion'
of the underfunding. This would be secured on TWA's international routes and
on its Kansas City maintennance base - so that if these assets were sold at
a later date, the proceeds would flow to the pension plans. Payments on the
note would be made over a 15-year period.
The two plans would also be 'terminated' - that is, closed off - and the
PGBC, the federal agency which underpins pension benefits in the US, would
then pursue its claims against Mr Icahn and his other business interests.
This could lead to legal action.
The pension controversy has overshadowed progress on any restructuring at
TWA for months. PGBC wants Mr Icahn, and his other companies, to make good
some of the underfunding, which it calculates at Dollars 1.2bn. Until this
is resolved, a reorganisation plan - which would give TWA's employees a 45
per cent stake in the airline in exchange for wage concessions, with
unsecured creditors taking the remaining 55 per cent - cannot be
implemented.
The proposal comes a week after inconclusive talks between the PGBC and Mr
Icahn, and does not have the TWA owner's agreement. TWA said yesterday the
proposal was 'under review'.
Meanwhile, the PGBC said it had informed the carrier's unions of the scheme
and they were examining the plan. Most participants in the pension schemes
would get full benefits under the proposal, although some fund members could
face reduced benefits.
Earlier yesterday, the carrier revealed a Dollars 3.2m loss for August after
tax. The operating deficit was slightly larger, at Dollars 7.49m, although
this was a considerable improvement on the Dollars 28.7m which the carrier
lost in the previous month.

UNION officials will meet shop stewards this morning in an attempt to
resolve an unofficial walkout by more than 2,000 workers that has halted
construction of the Enron gas-fired power plant, Teeside.
The workers - employed by the main contractor, Wimpey, and nearly 20
subcontractors - walked out on Monday in a protest over safety standards.
Enron Power Corporation said the safety issues had been addressed, but the
workers refused to return until Monday unless they received full payment for
the hours they had lost. The company had offered them 10 hours' money each.
Enron has warned that they are in breach of agreements and are risking
dismissal. Teesside officials of the main unions involved will today urge
the workers to return to work immediately.
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned power station operator in England and
Wales, intends to be viewed 'as a private sector investment' for its next
programme of station construction after 1994, Mr John Collier, its chairman,
said yesterday.

Tighter exhaust emissions controls and the development of technically more

<TEXT>
JD WETHERSPOON, the London chain of pubs which feature cheap real ale and no
music, will offer shares worth Pounds 24m when it is floated shortly on the
stock exchange - a higher figure than initially expected.
The group is expected to have a market capitalisation of between Pounds 40m
to Pounds 45m.
A pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, said the shares would be
placed with institutional investors, with an as yet unspecified number of
shares available for financial intermediaries.
Dealing will start about a week after the final prospectus is published,
which is expected in about a fortnight.
The company will raise at least Pounds 18m and existing shareholders are
expected to raise Pounds 6m.
Mr Tim Martin, 37, who founded the rapidly-expanding chain, is not selling
any shares leaving him with about 25 per cent of the company post-flotation.
The company has 44 outlets within the M25 and will use the proceeds from the
flotation to develop a further 18 sites for which it has obtained planning
and licensing permission.

Evelyn Waugh was famed for rather ostentatiously putting his ear trumpet
down when he did not want to listen. Now Siemens has introduced a tiny
in-the-ear hearing device that allows users to tune in to what they want to
hear and not what they do not.
The Insita Plus overcomes a problem for the hard of hearing. Hearing loss is

SHARES in most of the leading US retail groups rose yesterday after the
retail sector painted a brighter sales picture for September.
The figures, showing presentable same-store sales gains at most major
retailers last month after relatively drab figures for much of the summer,
suggested there may be a modest improvement in consumer confidence.
However, industry participants also cautioned that the relatively late date
for Labor Day pushed some 'back-to-school' spending from August into
September.
Among the big department store groups, Dayton Hudson - which takes in the
Marshall Fields chain as well as the Target discount retail operation -
showed a 6.2 per cent gain in sales from stores which had been open for a
year or more.
The Federated Department Stores group - incorporating the likes of
Bloomingdale's and The Bon Marche - posted a 6.6 per cent improvement in
same-store sales. Neiman Marcus registered a 3.3 per cent advance in
same-store sales, and J. C. Penney a 14.4 per cent gain from mainline
stores.
At Sears, Roebuck, there was a 5.3 per cent advance in comparable domestic
store sales - with major appliances, home office equipment, clothing and
hardware doing well, but car products and services still lagging.
At Woolworth, same-store sales in the US were up by 5.5 per cent.
Wal-Mart Stores - the nation's largest retailer in sales terms - posted a 12
per cent advance in same-store sales, lifting eight-month sales 26 per cent
to Dollars 33.5bn.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Banks refuse to offer Jubilee Line cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF's bankers refused yesterday to make a no-strings offer of cash
to build the extension to London Underground's Jubilee Line, making it
almost inevitable that the project will not go ahead.
The 11 banks, which met yesterday, had already made an offer of Pounds 390m
conditional on civil servants moving to Canary Wharf, the failed development
in London's Docklands. The government does not regard that as a proper offer
under the terms it laid down earlier this year.
A government adviser said: 'I do not understand why the Canary Wharf
administrators have been claiming that the banks made an offer of funds for
the line, because they really had not.'
The government has said that the extension would go ahead only if the
private sector contributed Pounds 400m to the Pounds 1.6bn cost. Under the
terms, that contribution must not depend on any form of government support,
such as rent from a ministry.
The bankers had been hoping that the Department of the Environment would
relocate its main office to Canary Wharf. The department is now likely to
move its civil servants to empty government buildings in Whitehall. 'It
would have been utterly uncommercial of us to remove the condition of the
civil servants moving to Canary Wharf,' a banker said.
However, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, insisted yesterday
that no decision had yet been taken on the department's relocation, and
emphasised again that the judgment would be made on the basis of value for
money.
If the Tube extension is abandoned, the administrators of Canary Wharf will
have enormous difficulty in finding tenants for the Pounds 1.5bn
development, the bankers said. One option, one of the bankers said, would be
to mothball most of the 15 buildings until the property market recovered.
London Regional Transport is making a last-ditch attempt to save the Jubilee
Line extension. It has commissioned a study from London Economics, the
research group, on the net costs of the line to the government, taking
account of indirect and direct tax revenues generated by the construction
project and social security savings.
It estimates the net costs at Pounds 972m, even without a contribution from
the private sector. However, the Treasury is understood to be unimpressed by
the argument.

debt payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) is to write-off its property investments
in Spain and ask creditor banks to take over its 34 per cent stake in Prima
Inmobiliaria, the domestic property developer, as payment for its debts.
This will fuel the controversy that has surrounded the KIO in Spain since
last July when Ercros, its Spanish domestic chemicals arm, went into
receivership.
A spokesman for Grupo Torras, the KIO's holding company in Spain, said
yesterday: 'We cannot make Prima viable in the present environment'. He said
Torras would offer the banks its shareholding for a symbolic one peseta and
ask them to take over the running of the company.
Prima's debts with some 60 creditor banks total Pta57bn (Dollars 555m),
according to Torras, and more than half of it is secured against properties
owned by the developer. In early August, the KIO, which had temporarily
ceased paying interest on the Prima debt, resumed payments under a two-month
moratorium plan.
An initial angry reaction to the KIO's write-off came from the state-owned
Argentaria banking group, which has Pta1.6bn of outstanding credit with
Prima. An Argentaria spokesman said: 'We are not interested in a
debt-for-equity swap. We want to realise our loan and Prima's chief
shareholder has sufficient funds to pay up.'
The KIO said two weeks ago it would pump Dollars 1bn into its Spanish assets
and convert Dollars 1.4bn of the Torras holding company debt into capital
but it did not include Prima as a recipient of the new funds.
The KIO said the Torras Papel paper group would receive Dollars 400m as part
of a rescue plan and it is thought that further funds could be made
available to Ercros, whose troubled fertiliser business the KIO hopes to
sell to Freeport McMoRan of the US.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bergesen posts deficit of NKr32m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BERGESEN, Norway's biggest shipping group, plunged into an eight-month
pre-tax loss of NKr32m (Dollars 5.44m) from a NKr816m profit in the same
period last year, and warned of weakness for the remainder of the year. The
result was worse than analysts' forecasts.
Bergesen was forced to take a NKr141m loss on its share portfolio due to
investments in Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, and Uni Storebrand,
the country's biggest insurer which collapsed into the hands of state
administrators in August.
The group wrote down the value of DnB's shares to NKr2.50 each but the
shares have been trading on the Oslo bourse at under NKr1.50.
At the start of the year the book value of Bergesen's share portfolio was
NKr952m but increased to NKr1.05bn by end-August due to investments.
However, the market value of the portfolio fell by NKr410m to NKr1.08bn by
end-August. Operating profit for shipping plunged to NKr60m from NKr663m
while group operating profit fell to NKr61m from NKr679m.
Group operating revenue dropped NKr516m to NKr1.62bn as expenses in the
eight-month period rose NKr45m to NKr1.22bn.

<TEXT>
ORKLA, the Norwegian diversified foods group, reported a swing into loss of
NKr161m (Dollars 27.4m) in the first eight months of this year from a
NKr472m profit last year, due to a NKr874m charge against accounts on the
group's securities portfolio.
A charge of NKr228m represents a special write-down on its stake in Uni
Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer which collapsed into the hands of state
administrators in August.
At the end of August the market value of the group's securities portfolio
was NKr3.432bn, representing a 14.7 per cent decline since the end of last
year.
Group operating profit increased to NKr759m from NKr530m last year, helped
by a NKr650m advance to NKr10.99bn in operating revenue. Profits from
associated companies rose to NKr85m from NKr20m.
The group's branded consumer goods division lifted operating profit by 46
per cent to NKr627m from NKr429m in last year's comparative period, despite
a stagnation in domestic markets growth.
The chemical processing division nearly doubled operating profit to NKr118m
from NKr64m, but the improvement was helped by the disposal of a 50 per cent
stake in a vanillin plant for which it gave no further details.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Murdoch in joint venture to develop TV services
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH, chairman of News Corporation, the media group, and Mr
Andre Rousselet, chairman of Canal Plus, the French pay television service,
are setting up a partnership to develop new television services across
Europe.
The 50-50 partnership between Europe's two largest subscription television
companies is designed to take advantage of 'future technologies in satellite
transmission, digital compression and encryption'.
Engineers are increasingly optimistic that digital compression can be used
to squeeze up to four television channels into the space now occupied by
one. Encryption, or scrambling, of the television picture can be used to run
pay-per-view services - charging to view a film or sporting event.
A working group of senior executives of the two companies has been set up to
work out an agreement on programming, technology and strategy.
In each European country, including the UK, the aim would be link up with a
large local company to distribute any new services created.
Canal Plus claims a total of 4.5m subscribers to its pay television channels
in France, Germany, Spain, Belgium and western Africa.
Cable News Network and Financial Times Television said yesterday that from
the end of this year they would no longer jointly produce World Business
Today. FT-TV, which will continue making a range of business programmes,
apparently wanted a five-year deal with CNN, but the US company did not.

Correction (published 10th October 1992) appended to this article.
NORDIC Investment Bank has posted profits at eight months up 26 per cent to
SKr32m (Dollars 5.87m) from SKr25.4m in the same period in 1991.
The performance of the Helsinki-based bank, owned by the five Nordic
countries, stands in sharp contrast to the results of most other major banks
in the region, which have been ravaged by high credit losses.
The bank made a charge of only SKr1m in the latest eight months in respect
of anticipated loan losses.
Mr Jannik Lindbaek, president, said: 'We don't see any immediate risk of
credit losses in our portfolio, mainly because of our conservative lending
policies.'
CORRECTION
PROFITS at the Nordic Investment Bank rose 26 per cent to SDR32.0m (Dollars
48m) in the first eight months of the year. This was incorrectly reported in
yesterday's Financial Times.
The latest figure compares with an SDR25.4m profit in the comparable 1991
period. The Helsinki-based bank, which is owned by all five Nordic
countries, charged SDR1m in the latest eight months in respect of
anticipated loan losses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
L'OREAL, the French company which is the world's largest cosmetics group,
yesterday announced that it had continued its profits growth during the
first half of the year.
The company - with brands such as Lancome, Ambre Solaire and Giorgio Armani
perfume - saw pre-tax profits rise by 16 per cent to FFr2.2bn (Dollars 456m)
in the first six months of this year. It said it anticipated further profits
growth at a similar rate during the second half.
L'Oreal, which has recently been building up its interests in
pharmaceuticals to complement its existing business in cosmetics, hair care
and fragrances, saw sales rise by 15.8 per cent to FFr19.9bn during the
interim period.
The group's sales increased at the slightly slower pace of 10.4 per cent on
a strictly comparable basis. L'Oreal said yesterday that its first-half
sales had been inflated by the recent acquisition of two laboratories,
Delagrange and Delalande, by its Synthelabo pharmaceuticals subsidiary.
Although L'Oreal was confident that it would be able to maintain profits
growth at its present level in the second half, it said that the increase in
sales might be slightly slower.
One of the main planks of L'Oreal's expansion strategy in the 1980s was to
move into more upmarket product areas. L'Oreal two years ago took a 50 per
cent stake in Orcofi, a consortium of luxury goods companies which is run as
a joint venture with the Recamier family.
Orcofi next week is staging a lavish relaunch for Lanvin, the Paris fashion
house intended to be the linchpin of its portfolio. Lanvin, which is being
relaunched at a time when the global luxury goods market is under enormous
pressure, has so far produced sizeable losses for the Orcofi partners,
including L'Oreal.

<TEXT>
HACHETTE, the heavily-indebted French media group, has accused Havas, one of
its strongest competitors in the French media market, of having secretly
bought up a sizeable block of its shares.
Since the start of this week, Hachette's shares have risen sharply. The
shares yesterday rose by FFr16.8 to FFr158.7, a leap of 11.8 per cent on the
day. This followed brisk dealing on Tuesday and Wednesday when 615,800
shares were traded representing 3.1 per cent of the company. Hachette's
shares started the week at just FFr115.7.
Initially the rise in Hachette's share price was attributed to speculation
ahead of the announcement of the terms for its proposed merger with Matra,
the defence electronics concern which, like Hachette, is chaired by Mr
Jean-Luc Lagardere and controlled by his family.
Havas later denied any interest in buying shares in Hachette, Reuter
reported.
Hachette made a net loss of FFr1.93bn in 1991 on turnover of FFr30.4bn.
For the first half of 1992 Havas made a net profit of FFr567m against
FFr939m in the same period in 1991. Turnover was up 6.6 per cent at
FFr14.3bn.

THE Swedish government yesterday announced plans to create an Ecu1.6bn

enterprises, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The project will be financed initially from a state-run fund abolished last
year which the government used to buy shares in Swedish companies.
The fund, which was financed through a tax on profits, is in effect being
converted into a private capital scheme in which the government will retain
a 37 per cent stake.
It will be owned and run by the Swedish companies that contributed to the
old wage earner fund.
Two main funds will be set up and operated by 150 of Sweden's large
companies. Each will have capital resources of SKr2.2bn (Dollars 429m).
In addition, six regionally based funds will be established with capital
resources totalling around SKr400m each. They will be controlled and 89 per
cent owned by around 2,600 smaller companies.

<TEXT>
THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) is to write-off its property investments
in Spain and ask creditor banks to take over its 34 per cent stake in Prima
Inmobiliaria, the domestic property developer, as payment for its debts.
This will fuel the controversy that has surrounded the KIO in Spain since
last July when Ercros, its Spanish domestic chemicals arm, went into
receivership. The KIO has earlier changed and stopped the flow of funds to
Spanish assets.
A spokesman for Grupo Torras, the KIO's holding company in Spain, said
yesterday: 'We cannot make Prima viable in the present environment'. He said
Torras would offer the banks its shareholding for a symbolic one peseta and
ask them to take over the running of the company.
Prima's debts with some 60 creditor banks total Pta57bn (Dollars 555m),
according to Torras, and more than half of it is secured against properties
owned by the developer. In early August, the KIO, which had temporarily
ceased paying interest on the Prima debt, resumed payments under a two-month
moratorium plan.
An initial angry reaction to the KIO's write-off came from the state-owned
Argentaria banking group, which has Pta1.6bn of outstanding credit with
Prima. An Argentaria spokesman said: 'We are not interested in a
debt-for-equity swap. We want to realise our loan and Prima's chief
shareholder has sufficient funds to pay up.'
The KIO said two weeks ago it would pump Dollars 1bn into its Spanish assets
and convert Dollars 1.4bn of the Torras holding company debt into capital
but it did not include Prima as a recipient of the new funds.
The KIO said the Torras Papel paper group would receive Dollars 400m as part
of a rescue plan and it is thought that further funds could be made
available to Ercros, whose troubled fertiliser business the KIO hopes to
sell to Freeport McMoRan of the US.
Prima's collapse has been triggered by its huge investment in two skyscraper
blocks in Madrid. Some Dollars 500m of the debt has been incurred by this
project, due to be be completed by the end of 1993.
The Torras spokesman said the property values in the area surrounding the
twin towers had fallen so steeply that they now represented half of what it
had cost to build them.
The row that is now brewing between Prima and its creditors will focus on
the depressed value of the assets but it is also likely to include the
extent of the KIO's shareholding in the property developer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, Labour leader, yesterday accused the government of preparing
to use the sterling crisis as an excuse for cuts in public spending.
In a letter to Mr John Major, he renewed his demand for the prime minister
to spell out the events leading up to sterling's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism.
'I understand your keenness to draw a line under these events, but these are
questions which must be answered,' he said.
'We have a right to know the truth because Black Wednesday is clearly going
to be used by you and your ministers as the scapegoat for the imminent
abandonment of Tory election pledges on public expenditure - pledges which
you were always intending to abandon. Indeed, the round of ministerial
discussions on spending cuts began well before the sterling crisis.'
Labour later demanded that the prime minister outline an immediate 'national
recovery programme' in his speech to the Tory conference tomorrow.
The challenge was issued at a news conference by Labour's economics team led
by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor.

BRITISH companies are continuing to close down in record numbers, according
to new figures from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants.
Reporting a further big rise in the number of companies going into
receivership, Mr Tim Hayward, KPMG head of corporate recovery, said there
was still no sign of the economy emerging from recession.
According to KPMG, 1,059 companies were placed in the hands of receivers in
the three months to the end of September. The total represented a jump of
nearly 12 per cent from the 948 recorded in the previous three months.
South-east England took the brunt of the closures, accounting for about 52
per cent. The least affected regions were south Wales and Scotland. The
sector worst affected was manufacturing, followed by construction, financial
services and retailing.
Mr Hayward said a 'dramatic cut' in interest rates was needed to help to
stem the tide of business failures.
He added: 'Unless the government risks its commitment to reduce inflation
and introduces a dramatic reduction in interest rates in order to bring
about an increase in consumer confidence, I cannot see recovery happening in
the near future.'
Mr Hayward warned that exporters would continue to struggle throughout next
year.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: EC environment rules
will stay, Howard says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community directives on environmental standards would not be
abandoned as part of the government's work on subsidiarity, or minimum
interference by the EC Commission, Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Howard, speaking after his conference address, said it was hard to see
any directives that should be repealed, although there were some that should
be reviewed.
He emphasised that the environment was an area in which many of the issues
crossed national boundaries and he indicated that even directives that were
less obviously trans-European, such as those on beaches and on drinking
water quality, would remain.
However, he added that it was now unlikely that the Commission would
legislate in some areas where it had planned to do so, for example on
standards in zoos across the EC.
Mr Howard's defence of the Commission's role in environmental issues was
matched in his conference speech by his emphasis on its duties in ensuring
proper enforcement of EC directives by all the member states, as included in
the Maastricht treaty.
The representatives warmly applauded his comment: 'I'm getting sick and
tired of taking lectures from countries who don't take a blind bit of notice
of existing laws themselves'.
He suggested that the drive for stricter enforcement might end 'the cynical
charade of countries signing up to new laws to catch headlines at home when
they have not the slightest intention of putting them into effect'.
Mr Howard is to receive a report at the EC summit which is to be held in
Edinburgh in December from Mr Karel van Miert, the acting environment
commissioner, on whether member states of the community are complying with
EC legislation.
Next month the UK is to host a conference for environmental inspectors from
across Europe that is intended to establish a common approach to enforcing
the EC's directives on the environment.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Move to abolish May Day
holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE May Day bank holiday might be abolished as early as 1995, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, the employment secretary, announced yesterday.
Mrs Shephard said the May Day holiday, celebrated by many countries as
Labour Day, had been forced on Britain by the TUC. She told the conference:
'You have made your opposition to that Socialist holiday quite clear.'
One possible replacement is an October holiday to commemorate the Battle of
Trafalgar, but Mrs Shephard said her personal preference was for an extra
day added to the late August bank holiday, which might be less disruptive to
business than an isolated day. She promised to consult on the issue.
Any change would not apply to Scotland, which has had a May Day holiday for
longer than the rest of the UK.
In her speech ending the employment debate, Mrs Shephard said that if an EC
48-hour working time directive were adopted, the government would challenge
it in the European court of justice. 'Despite the improvements we have won,
we remain fundamentally opposed in principle to this directive,' she said.
She later hinted that wages councils might be abolished in the Industrial
Relations Bill expected to go before parliament later this year.

FT  09 OCT 92 / President handed tax bill problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate last night handed President George Bush a tricky political
problem, less than a month before the presidential election, by passing a
Dollars 27bn tax bill that he may feel obliged to veto.
Mr Bush supports the core of the bill, which includes the creation of 50
urban and rural enterprise zones to promote investment, an increase in the
tax-deductible income ceilings for those with personal pensions, and a
repeal of the special tax on certain luxury items, such as yachts and furs,
though not cars.
However, the bill also contains several small tax increases - on moving
expense allowances, on securities dealers and on high-income retired people
 -which run counter to the president's renewed election promise not to raise
taxes 'ever, ever.'
With the House of Representatives already adjourned and the Senate about to
be, Mr Bush need not formally exercise the veto but could simply not sign
the bill, a tactic known as the pocket veto.
Either way, Senator Robert Dole, Republican minority leader in the Senate,
predicted the bill would not become law.
The loss of the enterprise zones would be seen as a defeat for the
president's commitment to improve the inner cities.
He might blame his action, or inaction, on the Democratic-controlled
Congress, but a portrayal of the country's poor as suffering by his desire
to preserve tax breaks for the rich would put him where he does not want to
be - on the political defensive.
Reuter adds from Washington: Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic
presidential candidate, received the endorsement yesterday of nearly 600
economists, including nine Nobel prize winners.
They said they liked his plan to revitalise the US economy through
government spending and tax breaks for business investment.

'The extension of (the embargo) has the potential to cause grave damage to

US President George Bush was yesterday set to approve the Cuban Democracy
Act. The Commission said the act would force US and Cuban trading partners
to comply with US prohibitions on trade, even though they lie outside the

THE NEW UN co-ordinator on Cyprus yesterday criticised a Turkish-Cypriot
plan to move people into an area abandoned by Greek Cypriots, Reuter reports
from Nicosia.
Mr John Maresca said the measure did not contribute 'a positive attitude'.
He was answering a question on a plan, disclosed by Mr Rauf Denktash, the
Turkish-Cypriot leader, on Tuesday, to house foreign students in buildings
in Varosha, a deserted suburb of the Turkish-held coastal town of Famagusta.
The Greek-Cypriot inhabitants of Varosha fled their homes when the Turkish
army invaded the island in 1974. Turkey has 30,000 troops in the occupied
northern third of the island.
The government of Cyprus protested to the United Nations about the Varosha
plan yesterday. However, Mr Maresca, speaking after meeting President George
Vassiliou of Cyprus, said he thought progress was possible in the next round
of UN-sponsored talks in New York on October 26.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Missiles row sours CIS summit: Clash over N-weapons puts
Commonwealth plans in doubt

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE dispute between Russia and Ukraine over strategic nuclear weapons is
jeopardising the meeting of leaders of the former Soviet republics on the
eve of their Commonwealth summit.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President, put a brave face on things when he
arrived in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, where today's meetings are to
be held, saying 'it is not a tragedy' if all 10 member states do not agree
to all proposals.
But the increasingly hostile row over the missiles demonstrates that the
two-speed Commonwealth proposed by Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of
Kazakhstan, earlier this week, could be a very volatile entity.
The argument was sparked by Russia's surprise decision to claim jurisdiction
over all the former Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, which the leaders of
Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, the four nuclear republics, had
previously agreed should be collectively controlled through the Commonwealth
of Independent States' joint command.
However, in an interview with Russia's Nezavisimaya Gazeta, published
yesterday, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, head of the joint forces, said
that, in agreement with Mr Yeltsin, he was ready to turn over all of the
weapons to Russia immediately.
'You cannot leave such terrible weapons under the control of anything other
than a specific nation-state,' Marshal Shaposhnikov said.
That sparked the ire of Ukraine, which has sought to steer an independent
course and opposed efforts to transform the Commonwealth into anything more
than 'a court for obtaining a civilised divorce'.
'We like what we've got,' said President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine.
'Ukraine today has the right to block the launch of nuclear weapons from its
territory but is not claiming the right to press the button.'
Mr Kravchuk said last week that Ukraine, which has repeatedly promised to
become nuclear-free by 1997, had the technical ability to prevent the firing
of the 176 ICBMs stationed on its territory.
Russian officials said that Belarus, which is sticking close to Russia, had
agreed to the hand-over, while the position of Kazakhstan, which has
repeatedly vacillated in its long-term nuclear intentions, is unclear.
Russia is also likely to be attacked today following a threat by Mr Viktor
Chernomydrin, energy minister, to switch off oil supplies to republics which
do not pay outstanding debts to the Kremlin by Monday. The announcement, the
result of an interview with Mr Chernomydrin on Wednesday but widely
publicised yesterday, sent a tremor throughout the former Soviet republics,
most of which are heavily dependent on oil they buy from Russia at rates
well below world prices.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's acting prime minister, said that, in view of the
hostilities, documents establishing the parameters of the rouble zone and
increasing the authority of the CIS governing bodies were unlikely to be
signed.

JOBS and investment will be threatened if the government cuts its grants to
the regions, the Wales CBI said yesterday.
The employers' body argued against any reduction in financial aid to
assisted areas, currently under review as part of the government's
tightening controls on public spending. It said it was only new investment
that had prevented the principality from falling further behind the rest of
the UK.
'Any diminution of assisted-area status would threaten this flow of new
capital and jobs and thereby exacerbate already serious economic imbalances
between regions,' it argued in a paper submitted to the Welsh Office.

   THE LAW Society
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the governing body for solicitors in England and Wales - is proposing to
amend its rule book to make sexual and racial discrimination by solicitors a
disciplinary offence.
The society said it had decided to make the move because 'discrimination
continues on a worrying scale against black trainees and qualified
solicitors'.
The new rule will add to existing equal-opportunity principles in the
profession's code of practice, by requiring law firms and legal departments
to adopt and operate an anti-discrimination policy.
The society said that would force solicitors to address the issue and
examine practices on recruitment and dealings with ethnic minorities. Firms
will be free to develop their own anti-discrimination policies or adopt a
specimen society policy that includes targets for employing ethnic
minorities.
Small firms should have at least one ethnic-minority lawyer and large firms
should have at least 10 per cent of trainees and 5 per cent of other lawyers
of ethnic-minority origin. Large firms are expected to meet the 10 per cent
trainee target by the end of 1995.
According to society statistics for last year, there were 10,423 firms of
solicitors in 14,997 offices in England and Wales and 487 local authorities
and 1,507 organisations employing solicitors. There were only 800 solicitors
from ethnic minorities.
However, 14 per cent of new students in 1990-91 were from ethnic minorities
and the figure has been rising steadily.
The society emphasised that the targets were not quotas and could not be
enforced. Adherence to the policy, though, will be taken into account during
routine monitoring, which from 1994 will have to take place in firms
authorised to take trainees.
The society said discrimination on grounds of sex was almost entirely
directed against women in mid career, principally after the birth of
children.
It said it had anecdotal evidence of women being asked unlawful questions at
interview about whether they were planning to have children.
The proposals are being put out to the profession for consultation. The
society has made clear that it intends to have the new rules in place by
early next year.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Maxwell insurers near deal: Out-of-court settlement over
Pounds 20m life policy under discussion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON insurers are close to a settlement over a Pounds 20m policy on the
life of the late Robert Maxwell in a move to avoid a long and costly legal
battle.
An out-of-court settlement is under discussion involving the insurers,
Maxwell companies, and administrators who have failed to agree on the cause
of Mr Maxwell's death off the Canaries on November 5 last year. The
insurers, which include Lloyd's syndicates and London market companies,
would pay a figure believed to be in the region of Pounds 6m without
accepting liability.
Detailed discussions were under way yesterday to discuss how the money would
be divided, but it is likely that it will be shared equally between the four
principal beneficiaries.
The policy was taken out on behalf of two companies in the private Maxwell
business empire - Robert Maxwell Group and Headington Investments - and the
public companies Mirror Group Newspapers and Maxwell Communication
Corporation.
Some associated companies may claim a share of any eventual payout.
Under the terms of the policy, broked by Willis Wrightson, the UK subsidiary
of Willis Corroon, the full claim would be payable only if Mr Maxwell died
from accidental causes or murder. The policy is rendered invalid if he
committed suicide, or lied about his state of health when applying for the
policy. In his application, Mr Maxwell is believed to have stated that he
had no health problems.
Mr Roger Rich, of Rich Wheeler &amp; Company, loss adjusters, acting for the
insurers, remains convinced that the most likely cause of death was suicide.
Investigators acting for the beneficiaries have ruled out murder and a heart
attack. They have concluded that Mr Maxwell died from drowning after falling
into the sea. Both sides appear to have accepted that neither suicide nor an
accident can be conclusively ruled out on the basis of the forensic evidence
after autopsies carried out by Spanish, and separately by English and
Israeli pathologists.
Reaching a firm conclusion has been complicated by the less than thorough
nature of a Spanish police report; the absence of witnesses; and different
interpretations by the two sides of Mr Maxwell's behaviour prior to his
death.
There has also been disagreement over the significance of a sudden change of
course by Mr Maxwell's yacht the Lady Ghislaine on the morning of his death,
and by the apparent absence of references to heart ailments or surgery in
the insurance proposal form.
According to Mr Maxwell's personal doctors, he was healthy before starting
his final cruise. But he is known to have had part of one lung removed, and
had been suffering for years from fluid and respiratory ailments. Spanish
pathologists concluded Mr Maxwell could have died from a heart attack in the
water.
BARCLAYS Bank announced yesterday that it had failed in the Court of Appeal
to reverse a High Court ruling that it must face proceedings in the New York
Bankruptcy Court over a disputed Dollars 30m it received from Maxwell
Communication Corporation.
The bank obtained the money just before MCC went into administration.
In July, Mr Justice Hoffmann struck out an application by Barclays Bank for
injunctions to prevent Price Waterhouse, MCC's administrators, from bringing
proceedings in the US courts for the return of the money.
Yesterday, Lords Justices Glidewell, Mann and Leggatt dismissed Barclays'
appeal against Mr Justice Hoffmann's decision and refused leave to appeal to
the House of Lords.
Barclays, a creditor of MCC, received the Dollars 30m repayment on MCC's
overdraft at its branch in Holborn, London, in November last year. A short
time later, the company went into UK administration and applied for
equivalent Chapter 11 protection in New York.
Barclays argued that England was the correct forum for the dispute and
sought to bar the administrators from invoking US jurisdiction.

<TEXT>
NEW PROPOSALS for re-forming Sunday trading laws in England and Wales, put
forward by Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, are under
consideration by the government.
The so-called M and S proposals, presented this week to Mr Peter Lloyd, Home
Office minister, combine a plan to deregulate weekday shopping with a call
to permit convenience stores of up to 3,000 sq ft to trade on Sundays
with-out restrictions on hours.
It would also allow do-it-yourself stores, garden centres and other
leisure-related outlets regardless of size to open on Sundays.
To forestall opposition from large food retailers, it is suggested that they
should be permitted to trade on the four Sundays before Christmas.
Backers of the proposals are believed to include C&amp;A, Burtons, Next, Sears,
Gateway Food Markets, The Co-operative Wholesale Society, and Open, a group
of smaller convenience stores jointly promoting their interests.
Mr Morton Middleditch, chairman of Open, said the proposals were designed to
maintain a distinction between weekdays and Sundays while recognising
weekend shopping needs.
Prospects of early legislation appear to be receding, with senior government
figures suggesting that moves to bring forward a potentially divisive bill
would meet resistance while the question of Europe tops the agenda.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the elder statesmen of Britain's building industry are bowing out at
the low point of the recession and severing family ties with their firms
which go back several generations.
Sir Brian Hill, whose Higgs &amp; Hill family firm built many of London's more
famous buildings such as the Royal Naval College and the Tate Gallery, and
Paul Hyde-Thomson, who floated his family's Ibstock Johnsen brick-making
firm on the stock market in 1970, announced yesterday that they plan to step
down at the end of the year.
Sir Brian, 59, who has been chairman of Higgs &amp; Hill since 1983, is the
seventh generation of a family which started the business in 1874. Although
his cousin, David Hill, is deputy chairman, the company has decided to
choose the next chairman from outside the family. George Duncan (left), 58,
a former chairman of Lloyds &amp; Scottish, and current chairman of ASW Holdings
and Whessoe, joins the Higgs &amp; Hill board on November 10 and will take over
from Sir Brian as non-executive chairman at the end of the year.
Ibstock Johnsen, which like Higgs &amp; Hill cut its dividend yesterday, has
also gone outside for its new chairman. Colin Hope (right), 60, chairman of
T&amp;N, who was appointed Ibstock Johnsen's deputy chairman in January, will
take over from the 65-year-old Hyde-Thomson at the end of December.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Carr has resigned as a director of County NatWest to help develop a
project finance division at Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm.
As director of project finance, he joins a team of nine partners and about
40 staff including four assistant directors in the corporate finance
division. He is at least the second person to join from County in the last
two years.
Carr spent nine years at the Department of Energy including two on
secondment to Morgan Grenfell's energy and project finance department. He
then spent eight years at County NatWest, where he became a director
specialising in infrastructure finance.
'We began talking to each other and it seemed a very interesting
opportunity,' he says of his latest move. 'Project finance is a natural
extension of PW's existing work on privatisation.' The firm had already seen
the opportunities of moving into project finance, he says, so he was
'knocking at a door that was already ajar'.
Carr says that while banks often provide finance as well as advice on
raising funds, PW can carve out a niche without offering financial support
to its clients. 'Some clients are quite happy with someone clearly sitting
on their side of the table with no funding interest to cloud their advice,'
he says.

The board, which will meet monthly, is designed to ensure that the companies

<TEXT>
Pamela Taylor, the BBC's new director of corporate affairs, was not one of
the widely tipped favourites for the job. There had been rumours that Liz
Forgan, number two in the Channel Four hierarchy, or Edward Bickham, Douglas
Hurd's special adviser at the Foreign Office, would take over from Howell
James who is off to join his old mentor, Lord Young at Cable &amp; Wireless.
As the BBC limbers up for protracted negotiations with the government over
renewal of its Royal Charter in 1996 it was widely thought that someone with
Bickham's calibre of political contacts was just what was required to follow
in Howell James' footsteps. Before joining the BBC, James had been with
Capital Radio, TV-am and worked with Lord Young in government. Bickham was a
former director of communications at the late British Satellite
Broadcasting.
However, the BBC has recruited a skilled public relations professional in
the 43-year-old Taylor. She did not go to university and started at the
bottom of an advertising agency. After a spell with BUPA, the private health
care group, she joined the British Medical Association press office in 1977.
She arrived at the BMA at a low point in its fortunes. It was widely
regarded as a trade union whose prime purpose was to protect the interests
of well-paid doctors, rather than a professional body serving consumers. Its
nick-name at the time was the British Money Association.
Taylor set up the BMA's parliamentary lobbying effort in 1980 and took over
as head of public affairs in 1985. During her time at the BMA there has been
a considerable improvement in the public perception of the organisation and
it has become a much more effective parliamentary lobbying group.
She will probably be best remembered for the BMA's high-profile advertising
campaign against the government's plans for the national health service.
However, she herself is more proud of the parliamentary lobbying work the
BMA has done in areas such as seat-belt legislation, curbs on tobacco
advertising and drinking and driving.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Grassroots give Lamont a
rough ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVES set a stormy backdrop for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
yesterday with often rebellious speeches on Britain's economic policy - and
the perfunctory standing ovation Mr Lamont received afterwards suggested the
anger had not waned.
Delegates clapped Mr Lamont for about a minute as he sat down - short by
Tory party conference standards. Passions reached higher peaks during
sections on Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism and the
tempestuous debate that proceeded it among Conservative representatives.
'It is clear,' Mr Lamont said mid-way through his speech, 'that we must not
go back into the ERM unless and until . . . ' Then a Tory was cheered as he
interrupted to shout 'ever' before Mr Lamont continued, ' . . . it is right
for Britain.'
Mr Lamont was perhaps looking for trouble in the wrong place when he added:
'I know that saying this does not make me very popular in Brussels.'
Mr Andrew Tinney, from the south-east area Conservatives, won applause from
Lady Thatcher, but not her successor, when he insisted: 'You cannot fix
exchange rates between divergent economies'.
He demanded that sterling should not re-enter a fixed exchange rate system
'in my lifetime' and insisted that it was necessary that the government cut
expenditure and interest rates had to be lowered 'substantially'.
Mrs Patricia Morris, of Oldham, was cheered when she said sustained growth
and ownership had been 'hallmarks' of Conservative policy during the 1980s,
'until we began to flirt with membership of the ERM . . . Thank God for the
divorce.'
She continued: 'Unless things change pretty radically in a way wholly
appropriate to British interests, there must be no going back.'
Teasing Mr Lamont menacingly by accepting that there were no quick fixes,
Mrs Morris told Mr Lamont not to say 'everything would be okay by a week on
Thursday' and urged him not to 'spot those green shoots with the best eyes
in the hall'.
She won a standing ovation when she urged a return to the 'real agenda' for
recovery.
Councillor Dee Dee Dobell, from Yeovil, said: 'I'm disappointed because we
appear to have lost our way in the fog. We appear to have no captain or
navigator and the purser isn't sure how he is going to finance the trip
home.'
She accused the German Bundesbank of a 'calculated ploy' aimed at damaging
Britain by cutting its interest rate by only a quarter of 1 point last
month.
Calling for an immediate 5-percentage-point cut in interest rates, Mrs
Dobell said small businesses were the heart and soul of the party.
To cheers, she told Mr Lamont: 'They give their time, they give their money
and they give their full support to our cause - and you are kicking them in
the teeth.'
But the conference displayed apparent schizophrenia by applauding - and
booing - loudly when Mrs Monica Drinkwater, of the Cheltenham Conservative
party, told the audience: 'There are enough Opposition and media
commentators rocking the boat - we do not expect the elders of our own party
to join in.
'This is a time for national and party loyalty.'
Lady Thatcher, whose outburst over the ERM and Maastricht had provided a
thunderous prelude to the debate, sat silently on the platform.
Mr Vernon Davies, from Essex, praised the leadership of Mr John Major for
'steadying the country after the collapse of the ERM'. He, too, called for
cuts in interest rates, 'by 2 or even 3 per cent.'
Mr Stephen Hillier, from Cambridge, said many commentators were 'baying like
Draculas' for the blood of the chancellor.
'But we have heard very little from them of the daily devaluation of our
currency which, even since 1979, has caused the value of our money to halve
 -the rabid effects of inflation.'
Mr Philip Allott, from Harrogate, called for Mr Lamont either to rejoin the
ERM or cut interest rates. 'No confidence will be created until the
government clarifies what our new economic policy is. Arguably, some could
believe that the chancellor is rudderless,' he said.

<TEXT>
THE OPPOSITION parties were quick to highlight what they saw as the weakened
government commitment on inflation in Mr Norman Lamont's speech, but then
used the chancellor's explanation of the new strategy as an occasion for
reviving their own economic remedies.
Labour then challenged Mr John Major to use his conference speech today to
announce a national recovery programme, comprising moves to restore business
confidence, to stimulate the housing market, and to remove the fear of
unemployment.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said that none of Mr Lamont's
targets was new 'except his clear abandonment of zero inflation', while Mr
Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, accused the chancellor of being
vague both about inflation and about interest rates.
'Mr Lamont's chancellorship is so bankrupt that the only alternative he can
offer to the policy that has failed is an earlier policy that has also
failed,' Mr Brown said.
'There was not one mention of the unemployed, of bankruptcies or
repossessions in a speech from Mr Lamont that was more intent on saving his
job than saving the jobs of others,' Mr Brown said.
Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Beith attacked Mr Lamont for not replacing
sterling's membership of the ERM with anti-recession measures and the
announcement that the Bank of England would be independent. Labour attacked
Mr Lamont on public spending, warning that the tough spending round would
delay recovery and increase unemployment.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the government of using the
sterling crisis as an excuse for public spending cuts. He wrote to the prime
minister, demanding he make public more details about the events leading up
to the pound's suspension from the ERM, since that was a 'scapegoat' for
abandoning Tory election pledges.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Warning on 'shoehorning'
sterling back into ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Conservative economic commentators took the argument about the
government's new strategy to the conference fringe yesterday, and reached
diametrically opposed conclusions about whether sterling's suspension from
the European exchange rate mechanism was a liberation.
Sir Alan Walters, Lady Thatcher's former economic adviser, welcomed the
return to monetary targets but accused Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of
fudging the issue.
He warned that the political imperative of pressing ahead with the
Maastricht treaty would ensure that the pound would shortly be 'shoehorned'
back into the ERM within the next six to nine months without the UK's
conditions for reform being met.
'The idea that we are not going back until the conditions are met is a
statement that we are not going to get on the Maastricht bus,' Sir Alan told
a fringe meeting organised by the rightwing Selsdon group.
Sir Alan suggested that the mechanism would last no more than 18 months
after sterling's re-entry before exploding again. He reserved particular
criticism for the 'ominous' statement that the government was not going to
target the exchange rate but was going to take it into account.
That meant, he argued, that when the exchange rate moved, the markets would
begin testing the government to see if and at what level it was prepared to
stop sterling's slide, because of fears of the inflationary implications.
Even if the government did not want to intervene, it would be forced to do
so, he said.
By contrast, Sir Leon Brittan, one of Britain's two European commissioners,
said that the government had had no immediate alternative but to try to
steer monetary policy with reference to a range of indicators.
Speaking at another meeting, he warned his Bow Group audience that past Tory
administrations in which he played a role had met difficulty when adopting a
similar blueprint.
A policy based on a range of indicators, he said, did not have the
credibility of steering via precisely defined targets, since it was
difficult for outsiders to tell whether the strategy was being observed.
There was 'a high element of discretion' in such an approach. It would need
to be 'buttressed' by fiscal policy, he said. The former cabinet minister
added that sterling's suspension from the ERM was likely to last 'quite a
while', but dismissed the idea that quitting the ERM would be a liberation.
Referring to the opt-outs negotiated by Britain on monetary union and the
social chapter, Sir Leon argued: 'The case for ratifying the Maastricht
treaty is far stronger for Britain than for anyone else.'
Britain would derive no competitive advantage from not joining the social
chapter if the chapter were not implemented by its European partners, he
said.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Bottomley pledge on NHS
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will honour its manifesto pledge to make annual increases in
real National Health Service spending, in spite of the pressure being
brought to bear on departmental budgets, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, said yesterday.
She also told representatives that a further 128 hospitals and community
health services would be joining the ranks of NHS trusts from next April,
bringing to two thirds the proportion of such care that will be provided by
the trust regime.
A total of 150 hospitals had applied to join the third wave of NHS trusts
altogether, she said.
Speaking after her enthusiastically received conference address, Mrs
Bottomley told reporters that she 'stood by' the manifesto commitment to
'year by year increase the level of real resources committed to the NHS'.
Although they will surprise many in the light of indications that the
Treasury may want to lower further the Pounds 244.5bn public-spending total
agreed for 1993-94, her comments do not rule out cash reductions in the
health budget, which was slated to rise by more than 6 per cent - or well in
excess of the rate of inflation.
Next April, local authorities will become responsible for co-ordinating a
policy to help elderly and handicapped people to remain in the community,
receiving Pounds 539m in community care grants in the first year.
Announcing that the patients' charter was to be extended to cover primary
care and 'unacceptable' outpatient waiting times, she also laid out a
blueprint for a new 'quality initiative' intended to disseminate best
practice.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Cool welcome for revised
economic framework
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new framework for economic policy met with a mix of cautious approval,
scepticism and outright hostility from the markets and industry.
There was some praise for the chancellor's effort to set out an explicit
inflation target, but doubts were expressed as to whether it would stick.
There were also some worries about whether the fall in the exchange rate
since sterling's devaluation would be enough to produce an economic recovery
without lower base rates soon.
The Confederation of British Industry said the inflation target appeared
'realistic and sensible', and it welcomed the recognition of the importance
of the exchange rate in the conduct of monetary policy.
Against that, it said the burden of controlling inflation had to be spread
more evenly between public and private sectors, without endangering public
investment programmes.
The Institute of Directors welcomed the indication of tighter control on
public expenditure and hoped confidence generated by the policy would allow
further cuts in interest rates.
The Federation of Small Businesses said there was nothing to lift
confidence. Mr Ian Handford, chairman of the federation's policy unit, said:
'Concentration on lower and lower inflation, cutting public expenditure and
lower taxation implies more of the same medicine, at whatever cost in terms
of business failures and job losses.'
In the City, Mr Gwyn Hacche, an economist at stockbrokers James Capel, said:
'Much of the detail of what Mr Lamont had to say reflects old ideas which we
saw in the 1980s, when they were not very successful.'
Mr Gerry Holtham, chief economist at the London office of Lehman Brothers,
the US investment group, said: 'While Mr Lamont appeared to be tough on
inflation, he has given us very little new information. His performance
yesterday was a long way short of first division.'
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said he was worried
by the idea of an inflation target, a lagging indicator. That might mean
that when inflationary pressures built up causing the target to be exceeded,
it might be too late for the government to take avoiding action.
Some in industry were more openly hostile. Mr David Holloway, president of
the Housebuilders' Federation, said the government was 'sleepwalking to
disaster' by continuing to pursue inappropriate policies.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the construction group, said the
failure to address Britain's economic troubles was a 'ferocious blow' to
industry, which was dying while the economy stagnated.
He said Britain needed a structured, economic programme for stimulating
recovery. Industry recognised the need for cuts in public-sector borrowing
but said current spending should be reined back and not capital projects.
Unions also reacted angrily. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, called
Mr Lamont a 'do-little' chancellor and urged him to restart the economy
through more targeted expansion of public spending on housing, transport and
the inner cities.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union said: 'It was a limp speech from a wilting government. We are waiting
for an economic strategy to revitalise industry and it was not forthcoming.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Thatcher fails to sink
ship of state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH HER Exocet already fired on to the front pages of the national press,
Baroness Thatcher steamed in to the Conservatives' Brighton conference
yesterday to gauge the damage.
Her reconnaissance mission must have reached painful conclusions. For while
her fiercely derisory attack on Mr John Major's European policy - ironically
in The European newspaper - had clearly holed the Tory ship of state, it had
equally plainly failed to sink it.
As she swept imperiously to the platform, those of her supporters capable of
objective analysis must have detected subtle changes in her reception.
The standing ovation she received roughly matched the decibels of last year,
but its duration was a paltry three minutes - a 60 per cent devaluation of
the nine she recorded in Blackpool. A good third of the hall - most
ostentatiously the bulk of the platform - remained seated.
It was clear too that the wily choreographers of conference management had
also learnt some tricks.
Lady Thatcher arrived at the start of a lacklustre debate on the environment
and was placed between the uncharismatic Leader of the Commons, Mr Tony
Newton, and the all-but-unknown Lord Strathclyde: well below the salt.
Mr Major, meanwhile, was nowhere in sight.
When the cries of 'speech' started up, Sir Norman Fowler was swiftly at her
side to record the ritual modest refusal. Equally rapidly, the conference
chairman relayed her decision to the hall.
Token resistance was manifest in the waving of the odd Union Jack, a hastily
scribbled banner labelled 'Come Back' and another, more apposite perhaps,
inscribed simply: 'Help.' But it was quickly over.
Pitting her own fiercely loyal personal following against the Tories'
time-honoured obsession with unity before ideology, Lady Thatcher was
playing a high-risk game.
And while she has yet to pass her sell-by date, the reception she received
must have served as a stark reminder that even the best-known political
brand names have a limited shelf life.
Furthermore, the conference was plainly keen to communicate its own message
to the former leader.
When Mr Michael Howard offered Mr Major a compliment - 'If ever a man has
earned our loyalty, he has' - the applause was out of all proportion to the
blandness of the sentiment.
Just before the economy debate, Mr Major's arrival was greeted with
exaggerated effusiveness. A token kiss was exchanged.
Yet it was a doughty lady delegate from Cornwall who tapped the conference's
soul when she warned, to thunderous applause: 'There are enough speculators
and media commentators rocking the boat, we do not expect the elders of our
own party to do so, too.'
Unchastened, she may have been. But Lady Thatcher, nonetheless, felt obliged
to offer a token clap.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Bloodied heavyweights
fight back - Philip Stephens on the likely course of the economic debate in
John Major's cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont has set out his stall. But around the cabinet table, the
intense debate over the government's economic policy promises to continue.
In the turmoil that followed sterling's ignominious departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism on September 16, one of the most important
political consequences has been missed.
The management of the economy can no longer be the prerogative of the
Treasury alone.
On that fateful day, Mr John Major invited the cabinet's three heavyweights
 -Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine - to put their
hands in the blood left by the collapse of his economic strategy.
They had arrived at Mr Major's temporary headquarters in Admiralty House
purely coincidently, summoned to discuss the Maastricht treaty. They stayed
willingly, ready to emphasise that the decision to suspend sterling's
membership of the ERM had been a collective one. All three believe that on
that single day at least neither Mr Major nor Mr Lamont could have played
the hand differently.
In retrospect, they seem uncomfortable with the fact that the Treasury and
the Bank of England had confronted the politicians with a fait accompli. The
issue they discussed on that day was not whether Britain could stay in the
ERM but how it might withdraw with the minimum damage.
By sharing the responsibility for the disaster, the troika have bought
themselves an important say in how the wreckage is eventually reassembled.
It is a role that they will not cede easily.
The troika was not and will not be consulted on the detail or the day-to-day
operation of the monetary strategy which Mr Lamont began to set out
yesterday. But anyone listening to Mr Hurd, Mr Clarke or Mr Heseltine doing
the round of the television and radio studios in Brighton could not escape
the conclusion that on the broad principles they are determined to have
their say.
In a curious reversal of roles, those in the Tory party who a decade ago
earned the label 'wet' (and that applies to the three of them) have emerged
as the strongest opponents of any move to use a floating pound as an excuse
to cut and run on interest rates.
They are afraid that the gain on inflation bought by the pain of the ERM may
now be frittered away. It is the traditional 'dries' - the monetarists of
the early Thatcher years - who believe that deflation rather than inflation
is now the principal threat to the British economy.
So only minimal textual analysis was needed this week to discern that the
troika is unhappy with the sharp fall in the pound's value over the past few
weeks; that it is urging Mr Major to ignore the calls from the right of the
party for a rapid ratcheting down in interest rates; and that it wants and
foresees re-entry into the ERM in a year or so.
Mr Lamont's position will not discourage the shift to more collective
decision-making.
The chancellor's long-term future remains uncertain. He had an unenviable
task yesterday and accomplished it without obvious mishap. But the
respectful rather than enthusiastic reception offered by the party faithful
was at best neutral. At worst, it will reinforce the belief that he is a
lame-duck chancellor, promised the keys of No 11 Downing Street only until
next year.
Mr Major, meanwhile, needs experienced shoulders to lean on as he begins the
painful process of rebuilding his political authority. He has to carry the
heavyweights if he is to carry his cabinet.
Entirely coincidentally, another change over the past month has reinforced
the influence of Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke over the shaping of economic
policy. When the new cabinet committee - EDX - was established to handle the
public-spending round, the assumption was that it would simply be a
mechanism to deliver the Treasury's public-spending targets.
In fact, it is proving also a vehicle for the other ministers to play a
prominent part in the shaping of spending priorities once set almost
randomly in the bilateral bargaining conducted by the Treasury.
There are no prizes for guessing who in EDX is arguing that big
infrastructure projects must be protected as far as possible from the
spending axe.
But it is the ERM - or rather whether the British economy can promise
sufficient convergence with its stronger European partners to allow the
pound's eventual re-entry - that will continue the politics of economic
management.
And here the men who put their hands in the blood on September 16 will
demand their say.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Bottomley 'will honour

THE GOVERNMENT will honour its manifesto pledge to make annual increases in
real National Health Service spending, in spite of the pressure being
brought to bear on departmental budgets, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, said yesterday.
Speaking after her enthusiastically received conference address, Mrs
Bottomley told reporters that she 'stood by' the manifesto commitment to
'year by year increase the level of real resources committed to the NHS'.
Although they will surprise many in the light of indications that the
Treasury may want to lower further the Pounds 244.5bn public-spending total
agreed for 1993-94, her comments do not rule out cash reductions in the
health budget, which was slated to rise by more than 6 per cent - or well in
excess of the rate of inflation.
Mrs Bottomley told representatives that a further 128 hospitals and
community health services would be joining the ranks of NHS trusts from next
April, bringing to two thirds the proportion of such care that will be
provided by the trust regime.
A total of 150 hospitals had applied to join the third wave of NHS trusts
altogether, she said.
Later, Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, general secretary of the National Union of
Public Employees, said: 'The health secretary has read the last rites for
the NHS with her government's go-ahead for 128 new hospital opt-outs.
'The first two waves have done nothing to cut closures, cancellations or
queues for treatment,' he said.
After last week's announcement of funding arrangements for next year's
community care reforms, she gave a stiff warning to Labour-run councils
'still harbouring an ideological grudge against the independent sector',
saying there was 'no place for out-dated socialist spite when it comes to
caring for the elderly and frail'.
Next April, local authorities will become responsible for co-ordinating a
policy designed to help elderly and handicapped people to remain in the
community, receiving Pounds 539m in community care grants in the first year.
'We have kept our promises: to fund community care fairly and properly,' she
said.
Announcing that the patients' charter was to be extended to cover primary
care and 'unacceptable' outpatient waiting times, she also laid out a
blueprint for a new 'quality initiative' intended to disseminate best

'We will seek out quality wherever it can be found and particularly where it
can be achieved more widely by making best use of existing resources,' she
said.
'We will draw together the most successful initiatives at the bedside, in
the clinic and in the community. We will distil this work into a checklist

She made no response to repeated calls from the floor for the government to
ban cigarette and tobacco advertising, however. Questioned later, she said
she was committed to further reductions in the number of people who smoked.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Opposition challenge to
government on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPPOSITION parties were quick to highlight what they saw as the weakened
government commitment on inflation in Mr Norman Lamont's speech, but then
used the chancellor's explanation of the new strategy as an occasion for
reviving their own economic remedies.
Labour then challenged Mr John Major to use his conference speech today to
announce a national recovery programme, comprising moves to restore business
confidence, to stimulate the housing market, and to remove the fear of
unemployment.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said that none of Mr Lamont's
targets was new 'except his clear abandonment of zero inflation', while Mr
Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, accused the chancellor of being
vague both about inflation and about interest rates.
'Mr Lamont's chancellorship is so bankrupt that the only alternative he can
offer to the policy that has failed is an earlier policy that has also
failed,' Mr Brown said.
'There was not one mention of the unemployed, of bankruptcies or
repossessions in a speech from Mr Lamont that was more intent on saving his
job than saving the jobs of others,' Mr Brown said, condemning Mr Lamont for
failing to chart a way out of the recession.
Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Beith attacked Mr Lamont for not replacing
sterling's membership of the ERM with anti-recession measures and the
announcement that the Bank of England would be independent. Labour also
attacked Mr Lamont over public spending, warning that the tough spending
round would both delay recovery and increase unemployment.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the government of using the
sterling crisis as an excuse for public spending cuts. He wrote to the prime
minister, demanding he make public more details about the events leading up
to the pound's suspension from the ERM, since that was a 'scapegoat' for
abandoning Tory election pledges.

<TEXT>
CAIRN ENERGY, the UK ind-ependent oil and gas company, plans to raise a net
Pounds 6.1m through a placing and open offer to shareholders.
It hopes to use Pounds 1.2m of the proceeds from the issue of 24.3m new
ordinary shares at 27p each to expand interests in its Palmers Wood,
Storrington and Albury onshore UK gas fields. It has a conditional agreement
to purchase further interests in these fields from Arco British.
About Pounds 1.9m will be used to repay debt, while the rest will boost
working capital. Proposed investment includes Pounds 600,000 to develop the
recently-discovered Ngatoro gas field in New Zealand.
Cairn reduced its after-tax loss from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 161,000 for the
first half of 1992. Turnover fell from Pounds 6.07m to Pounds 5.7m. The loss
per share was 0.66p (5.04p).
Mr Bill Gammell, chief executive, said the sharp upturn in US gas prices
promised a better second-half result.

<TEXT>
Isosceles, the heavily-indebted owner of the Gateway food retail business,
expects to complete the sale of its Wellworth subsidiary in Northern Ireland
shortly.
The group will be able to keep Pounds 30m of the proceeds of the sale to
help fund capital expenditure.
Gateway's capital expenditure budget is limited to Pounds 100m a year by
Isosceles' financial position.
The rest of the cash raised by selling Wellworth, which could be close to
Pounds 100m, will go to reducing the group's debt. At the end of its last
financial year debt stood at Pounds 1.26bn.
Yesterday, Isosceles' shareholders formally approved a refinancing which
involved interest deferral and new facilities.
Isosceles also announced that it had agreed to sell 12 shops to Iceland
Frozen Foods for Pounds 2.7m. Iceland said it would re-open the shops under
its name in the first quarter of 1993.

FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Platon in talks as losses rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATON International, the USM-quoted instrumentation group, is in
preliminary discussions which could lead to an offer for the group. The
shares rose 4p from the year's low to close at 26p.
The company also announced its results for the year to April 3 which showed
pre-tax losses of Pounds 547,000 (Pounds 484,000) after exceptional charges
of Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 410,000) relating to net rationalisation costs.
The auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, said the accounts had been prepared on a
going concern basis dependent on a significant increase in operating profits
in the present year or on additional sources of finance being obtained. They
added: 'We have been unable to satisfy ourselves yet as to the likelihood of
adequate profits or finance being achieved.'
Mr Robin Meyer, chairman, said he was unable to say when he could make a
further comment on the talks or whether the auditors had set a time limit
for seeking finance.
He added that the results had been delayed because the management had been
taking a number of actions to improve performance and wished to be able to
inform shareholders of their actions.
The moves include targetting sales activity on industries offering potential
and improving manufacturing efficiencies.
Turnover for the period improved 15 per cent to Pounds 7.53m (Pounds 6.56m)
for a trading loss of Pounds 74,000, against profits of Pounds 199,000.
Losses per share were unchanged at 5.1p.
The result of the losses left net assets down from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds
2.56m increasing gearing from 49 per cent to 100 per cent at the year end.
Mr Meyer said the present year had begun with two difficult months but was
encouraged by trading in June and July and the outlook for the second
quarter.

FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Merivale Moore dives Pounds 13m into the
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GRENVILLE Dean, chair-man of Merivale Moore, the property group,
attributed the 'debility of the company' - of which he controls 'about 20
per cent' - to 'the fraught and failing UK economy'.
The company plunged from pre-tax profits of Pounds 615,000 to losses of
Pounds 13m in the year to June 30 and its net asset value fell from 245.5p
to 77p. No final dividend is being paid (7.75p), leaving the total at just
1p (10.5p) for the year.
The greater part of the losses - Pounds 9.63m (Pounds 1.23m) - were
exceptional write-downs in respect of property values.
He said that net debt was about Pounds 50m, roughly the same as last time,
although in September 1991 the company bought 130 luxury residential flats
in London's St John's Wood from Norwich Union for Pounds 20m. So far 50 had
been sold.
This represented a dilemma for the company - repay the debt or trade out of
the recession. Mr Dean said his policy was a mixture of both, but that
purchases were likely to be one-off and only if they were of very good
value.
Otherwise, the priority was to reduce the debt and, to this end, some
low-yielding residential 'family silver' had been sold. Mr Dean suspected
that there had been some 'technical breaches' in its banking facilities as
cover had weakened, but that its banks were 'quite happy'.
Turnover was halved to Pounds 30.3m (Pounds 78.8m) and net rental income was
almost halved to Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 4.13m) after asset disposals. Total
income emerged at Pounds 7.35m (Pounds 14.1m). Operating losses were Pounds
3.35m (profits Pounds 1.84m).
Below the line there was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 7.74m (Pounds
148,000) relating to write-downs on long-term investment properties. This
resulted in retained losses of Pounds 19.7m (profits Pounds 169,000).
Losses per share totalled 144p (earnings 12.7p).

FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe lifted to Pounds 22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWTHORPE, the international electronic and electrical components group,
yesterday reported a 5 per cent gain in interim profits, buoyed by UK
acquisitions and improved sales penetration in the US.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 22.4m in the six months to
June 30, on turnover of Pounds 125.6m (Pounds 112.5m).
Earnings per share rose by 10 per cent from 7.17p to 7.88p and the interim
dividend is lifted to 1.79p (1.7p).
The relative weakness of sterling compared to the first half of 1991
contributed a Pounds 200,000 gain on the translation of pre-tax profits and
a Pounds 1m increase in reported sales.
Group operating profits rose to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 20.2m), offsetting
reduced net interest income of Pounds 548,000 (Pounds 1.14m).
UK operating profits increased to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 3.9m) with just over
half the growth coming from the Edgcumbe Instruments and Penny &amp; Giles
International acquisitions.
Mr John Westhead, chief executive, said profits from Penny &amp; Giles, the
aircraft 'black box' manufacturer acquired for Pounds 30m in May were below
expectations in the first half, but the management was 'positive about the
long-term prospects.'
Operating profits from continental Europe rose to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 8.7m).
Improved sales penetration in the US more than offset weaker demand in the
defence and medical markets and helped boost operating profits to Pounds
6.3m (Pounds 5.4m).
The contribution from subsidiaries and associated companies in the rest of
the world fell to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.2m), mainly because of weak trading
conditions in Japan.
Although Bowthorpe's results were not audited, the company, like several
others, has decided to include more detailed half-year information and a
statement from its auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, that the figures have been
'reviewed.'
COMMENT
Bowthorpe's management is adept at acquiring small niche electronics
businesses, integrating them, improving margins and finding synergies in
international product and marketing development. One example is the growing
market for the various data acquisition equipment produced by Optim
Electronics and the recently acquired Odessa Engineering businesses in the
US and Penny &amp; Giles in the UK. The strategy has served Bowthorpe well and,
given the group's strong cash flow and minimal borrowings, more selective
acquisitions are likely. Forecast profits of Pounds 45.3m this year put the
shares on a prospective p/e of just over 16 times earnings. This is a steady
stock in a recession, but not a bargain at current levels.

Bilston &amp; Battersea Enamels made some improvement in the half year ended
June 30 by cutting pre-tax losses from Pounds 52,000 to Pounds 28,000.
But the recession showed no sign of abating, and the company said it
continued to cut costs to preserve margins and cash flow.
Turnover in the period was Pounds 1.76m (Pounds 1.61m). Sales in the UK
improved 20 per cent on the low levels of last year, but exports continued
to be eroded as the recession increasingly affected those markets.
Losses per share came to 0.8p (0.9p).

FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Clarkson slumps to Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEMS at Lloyd's reflected in the first half figures of Horace
Clarkson, the shipping and insurance group, where profits crashed 75 per
cent and the interim dividend is being cut to a nominal 0.5p.
Mr Carron Greig, chairman, said the problems and the heavy losses incurred
by Names in 1988 and 1989 made the placing of personal stop loss extremely
difficult. That led to substantially reduced brokerage and increased the
cost of servicing claims.
For the period to June 30 turnover fell to Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 23.9m), with
insurance broking contributing Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 10m). Group pre-tax
profit came to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 6.1m) after the insurance side made only
Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 4.7m).
Mr Greig said the majority of insurance income was earned in the first half,
and the division as a whole would report a loss for the full year.
Earnings per share worked through to 3.5p (15.7p) and the interim payment
compares with 2.75p last time.

Watching live satellite TV at sea is normally an expensive affair, requiring
a gyrocompass to detect the movement of the ship and adjust the satellite
dish to keep it still. For vessel operators, the alternative normally
involves supplying video tapes to the vessel every time it berths.
Now Norwich-based Applied Satellite Technology has come up with a system
which does not require a gyrocompass. The Marine SAT TV 900 uses a patented
active antenna to lock on to signals from the Astra satellite, which covers
the seas round Europe.
The system, which costs Pounds 9,250, works by continuously sensing the
signal's strength and instantaneously compensating directionally, so the
receiving dish stays still as the vessel moves. Applied Satellite

snapped up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Artists through the ages have experimented with various ways of representing
depth in space. At the recent Photokina exhibition in Cologne Kodak unveiled
its own attempt to tackle three-dimensional representation, writes Michiyo
Nakamoto.
Kodak's depth-imaging technology uses track-mounted 35mm cameras with
electronic shutters to capture images from several perspectives. Up to 24
exposures on conventional film can be used to fashion one three-dimensional
image.
The film is processed normally and then scanned digitally. The information
is rearranged pixel by pixel into a single image, and then transferred to a
Kodak light valve technology film recorder. A transparent optical material
called a lenticular screen is placed over the picture to 'focus' the image.
The result is a three-dimensional picture that gives the illusion of depth
without needing special glasses.
Kodak believes there are potential applications in professional and
commercial photography such as for point-of-sale and cinema displays. Kodak:

<TEXT>
Well-proven ultra-violet technology is being put to a new use by a UK
company in a range of water disinfection systems which kill more than 99.9
per cent of micro-organisms without using chemicals.
The system, developed by Dorking-based Ultraviolet Technology, generates UV
light at 254 nanometres to provide the optimum 'kill rate', and is designed
so that unabsorbed UV light bounces back into the water to ensure maximum
disinfection.
The system is unique in using Teflon tubes which offer a number of
advantages over quartz equivalents that are brittle and prone to fouling.
Disinfection takes from three to five seconds, compared with 20-25 minutes
for chlorine. According to the company, the savings on chemical purchases
can cover the installation cost within one to two years. Ultraviolet

FT  09 OCT 92 / Technology: Farewell to the Teddy bear - Emiko Terazono
finds that Japanese children want electronic office goodies for Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With less than three months left until Christmas, Japanese toy companies are
preparing to stock the country's toy shops with high-tech goodies, rather
than the traditional Teddy bear or wooden bricks.
While many manufacturers have returned to making simpler products as the
current recession has forced consumers to go back to basics, toy makers are
defying the trend and presenting children with expensive high-technology
electronic products.
Recent surveys have indicated that electronic toys are in strong demand
among Japanese children. Toy makers have also discovered that high-tech
gadgets bring in fatter profits than conventional toys.
When Takara, the leading toy maker, introduced its word processor for
children two years ago, the demand was so high that the company created new
sophisticated versions during the following years. 'Children want the same
things as adults,' says Tomoko Matsue of Takara. My First Sony, a line of
kid's audio equipment from the big electronics manufacturer, was created in
1987 on a similar concept.
Japanese toy makers are feeling the impact of demographic changes, as the
decline in the number of children per household squeezes sales. But the
trend has also made Japanese parents willing to spend more on a child. Toy
makers have responded by introducing 'higher value added' toys to their
ranges.
The industry rule that high-priced toys will not sell was proved wrong by
brisk sales of Takara's Y39,800 (Pounds 185) word processor, co-developed
with Sharp, the office automation maker. The most recent version, launched
this year, costs Y55,000 (Pounds 260), but is seeing strong demand.
Takara expects to sell 40,000 units this year. The word processor has many
of the same functions as the kind sold to adults, but includes a simpler
instruction manual and illustrated keys.
Takara has targeted the mid-primary school age group. 'The children,
especially girls, use the word processor to write letters and make greeting
cards,' says Matsue. Some adults, who find the sophisticated models from
leading electronics makers too complicated, are also using the children's
version.
Other electronic gadgets for children offered by Takara in its 'Kid's
Electronics' range include the electronic diary and cordless phone. Other
than the usual address and schedule modes, the electronic diary has a
fortune-telling function, a recent hit with children.
The cordless phone has a time-limit function which prevents long
conversations by children, and a function which limits the telephone numbers
the phone can dial.
Takara's success has prompted other toy makers to follow suit. Bandai, the
largest toy maker, and Sega, the video game company, have also entered the
scramble in the high-tech toy market.
Sega will next month launch its word processor, targeting children at the
pre-school level as an 'introductory' model. 'Children demand the same
functions as the real thing, but simpler operating modes,' says Sega.
Sega's word processor 'Kan-Tan' - meaning easy in Japanese - is cheaper than
the other makers. At Y15,800, it consists of a small, light keyboard where
the functions can be changed by spreading different letter sheets on to the
keyboard.
The computer games have helped children grow accustomed to knobs and
function keys. 'Children are more adaptable to high-technology products,'
says Sega. As the Japanese government intends to introduce computer science
as a compulsory course in junior high-schools, an increasing number of
parents are keen to see their children learn to use computers.
Sega says it is developing a new range of high-tech toys to be launched
within the next few years. Although toy makers are the main manufacturers of
children's high-technology products, the market holds great potential for
the leading electronics makers as well. 'In a few years, we will probably
meet high competition from the large consumer electronics companies,' says
Sega.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Technology: Virtual reality takes its seat in class - Andrew
Baxter looks at a new approach to teaching children with learning
disabilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discworld, as fans of comic-fantasy novelist Terry Pratchett will know, is a
disc-shaped world carried through the Multiverse by four immense elephants
riding on the back of the ponderous galactic turtle Great A'Tuin.
Closer to home, more down-to-earth worlds are being created at the Shepherd
School in Nottingham, the largest in Britain for children with severe
learning difficulties - with a serious educational aim in view. Over the
past year, the school has been exploring the educational and training
benefits of Desktop Virtual Reality.
A sophisticated virtual reality system, with a display that changes up to 10
times a second, allows the user to experience the illusion of being within
the alternative environment on the screen.
Users normally 'immerse' themselves in virtual reality for entertainment -
by putting on a headset with a small LCD screen in front of each eye.
Desktop VR is the next generation, using the same VR software but on a
desktop computer.
This week, the school, along with Nottingham University's Virtual Reality
Applied Research Team, and Aldermaston-based Dimension International which
supplied the software and hardware, unveiled findings from a small pilot
project involving 12-20 students.
Virart, established last year, had been looking for a way to test the
benefits of virtual reality in education. The project's first stage has
involved creating virtual worlds which incorporate the well-established
Makaton symbol and sign system used by the school to help children master
the basic 500-600 words of vocabulary.
For example, says David Brown, a member of the Virart team, the screen could
create a three-dimensional car which the child could 'get in' and drive
around in, but the two-dimensional Makaton icon would be constantly in view.
The aim is to help the child learn the symbol, and thus to communicate,
giving the child at least some control over its environment.
Fully-interactive environments displaying images of the words along with the
appropriate symbol or sign ought to have more impact than static pages of
information.
The results so far have been impressive, says head teacher David Stewart.
'We have children here for 16 years from the age of three to 19. Our main
concern is to look for every way to help the children, so Desktop VR is an
important tool in our armoury.' And even if the system cannot always aid the
learning process, the three-dimensional world is as near to the real world
as some children get, he says.
So far, 20 symbols have been incorporated into virtual worlds, but it will
take three years, and more funding, to convert the whole Makaton library,
says Brown.
Further developments of the programme at Shepherd School will include the
introduction of sound and more detailed worlds, while the more able children
can create their own virtual worlds.
Other applications in education are possible, says Brown. History could be
presented in a different way using Desktop VR, and as the medium is
interactive, the student could change the course of past events and watch
what happens.

FT  09 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Jobs market statistics
encourage Dow

Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended higher across the board in busy trading yesterday in
the wake of a rise in bond prices and some welcome good news from the jobs
market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 23.78 at 3,176.03, near
its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished
up 3.49 at 407.74, while the Amex composite ended 0.13 higher at 367.01 and
the Nasdaq composite 4.69 higher at 573.89. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy
at 204m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1047 to 648.
The market posted early gains following unexpectedly good news from the jobs
market. Government figures released yesterday showed that weekly state
unemployment insurance claims fell by 24,000 in the week which ended on
September 26.
The decline went against expectations as analysts had been predicting
another rise in weekly claims, and some investors seized on the data as an
indication that conditions in the labour market may be improving.
Although shares fell back later in the morning and flirted with negative
territory around midday, a series of late afternoon computer buy programs,
apparently triggered by the rebound in previously-weak bond prices, provided
the market with a strong lift just before the close. Among individual
stocks, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) jumped Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in heavy trading after the company reported net income
of Dollars 412.9m in the third quarter, the 19th consecutive record quarter
for the group.
USAir climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 12 3/8 in turnover of more than 1m
shares after announcing that it had reached a settlement with striking
machinists.
The carrier said that 60 per cent of its service was back to normal
yesterday, and that a full service would be resumed by Monday.
Compaq rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 in turnover of 2m shares after
the computer company said its operating earnings in the third quarter would
be better than in the second.
Westinghouse Electric fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 after it
predicted that third quarter earnings would come in below 35 cents a share.
The company is also expected to take a charge of between Dollars 60m and
Dollars 100m on its investment in the discount drugstore chain, Phar-Mor.
Best Buy rose Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 on news that the retailer's
sales in September rose by 105 per cent to Dollars 156m. Another retail
group to report strong monthly sales was Wal-Mart Stores, up Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 58.
Canada
IN TORONTO, gains in financial services and mining led stocks higher. The
TSE-300 composite index climbed 21.86 points or 0.68 per cent to 3,237.22,
and advancing issues edged out declines 251 to 246.
Volume was 26.3m shares worth CDollars 296.5m as against 33.3m shares worth
CDollars 376.6m previously.
The financial services sub-group gained 1.46 per cent on index, mining was
up 1.67 per cent, and consumer products rose 1.45 per cent.
Industrial products and energy posted smaller gains, while golds were off
moderately.

FT  09 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses extend
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES extended their recovery from Monday's setback, the FT-SE Eurotrack
100 index ending less than 1 per cent below last Friday's level, writes Our
Markets Staff.
MILAN ended broadly higher in active trading as hopes that the capital gains
tax might be abolished for at least a year prompted a wave of buying. The
Comit index rose 12.54 or 3.4 per cent to 382.47 in turnover estimated at
more than Wednesday's L131bn.
The market was cheered by news in the morning that the Senate finance
committee had approved a measure that would abolish the capital gains tax
until September next year. The measure still needs the approval of the full
Senate.
Among blue chips, Fiat jumped 2.5 per cent or L95 to L3,850 while Generali
added 3.6 per cent or L950 to L27,350.
Trading in Italcementi and Italmobiliare resumed after Wednesday's
suspension. Italcementi rose L790 from Tuesday's close to L7,180 while
Italmobiliare added L1,500 to L31,500.
PARIS continued to rise on bargain-hunting but turnover was considerably
lower at FFr1.98bn. The CAC-40 index added 19.71 or 1.2 per cent to
1,673.86.
Trading was dominated by Hachette, Printemps and Michelin. Hachette jumped
FFr16.80 or 11.8 per cent to FFr158.70 on speculation that rival media group
Havas was building a stake.
Michelin dropped FFr6.30 to FFr175.50 on reports that Morgan Stanley had cut
its earnings estimates.
Paribas steadied after Wednesday's fall, closing 80 centimes better at
FFr279.10 but Ciments Francais B shares dropped FFr45 or 13.2 per cent to
FFr295 on worries about the losses at the cement company.
FRANKFURT extended its recovery as the DAX index rose 15.07 to 1,451.12.
Dealers gave carmakers some respite after their recent downgrading and,
relatively speaking, reserved judgment instead on the big three chemical
stocks.
The German chemicals association said yesterday that corporate earnings have
dropped more than 30 per cent in the year to date and added that no end to
the downturn is in sight. Bayer fell DM1.40 to DM253, although BASF rose DM1
to DM208.50 and Hoechst DM2.20 to DM221.40.
Volkswagen led a carmakers' recovery with a rise of DM6.40 to DM259.30.
Hoare Govett put VW among its principal buy recommendations this week,
saying that recent downgradings had been extreme and that it was holding to
earnings forecasts for VW of DM37 in 1992 and DM38 in 1993 against DM36 last
year.
AMSTERDAM saw buying in Heineken inspired by a newspaper report, denied by
the brewer, that Philip Morris of the US was interested in taking over the
group. The shares rose Fl 4.10 or 2.4 per cent to Fl 171.70 as the CBS
Tendency index advanced 0.7 to 108.5.
Nijverdal-Ten Cate, the plastics and textile manufacturer, dropped Fl 9.50
to Fl 86.50 after forecasting unchanged 1992 earnings, having said in August
that profits would rise by some 10 per cent.
Elsevier closed down Fl 1.90 at Fl 105.70 but off the day's low of Fl 102.0
on reports, later denied, that it had reduced its growth forecasts for
academic publishing.
ZURICH transferred its attentions to industrials, as banks eased on
profit-taking. The SMI index put on 12.1 to 1,870.3, chemicals led the
industrial sector higher with Ciba bearers SFr7 firmer at SFr632 and UBS
bearers, SFr1 easier at SFr789, topped the active list.
MADRID added another 5.91 points in the general index to 192.71. Mr Victor
Galliano of Baring Securities said that buyers were being tempted back into
the market by the low share prices following the peseta devaluation and the
imposition of currency controls.
STOCKHOLM saw continued weakness in Volvo, partly because of the effects of
weaker currencies in some of its European markets. The Affarsvarlden index
lost 2.4 to 653.1 in light turnover of SKr387m.
Volvo B declined SKr6 to SKr204. SKF B gained SKr2 to SKr72.50 on news that
the roller bearing group is selling an 80 per cent stake in a tool
manufacturer to Sandvik Coromant.

FT  09 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Politics sets pace for Brazilian
equities - Bill Hinchberger charts the effects of 'Collorgate' on the
Bovespa and foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politics continues to set the pace for Brazilian equities, a week after
President Fernando Collor de Mello was removed from office to face
impeachment proceedings in the Senate.
The euphoria surrounding the Chamber of Deputies vote to initiate the
impeachment process has left a post-Collor 'hangover', says Mr Alvaro
Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa).
Furthermore, the optimism stemming from the ousting of Mr Collor, with hopes
of a new administration backed by a broad coalition in Congress and top-name
ministers, has waned.
The Bovespa index tumbled when Mr Itamar Franco, the vice president who has
assumed the presidency, named Mr Gustavo Krause as finance minister, falling
by 11 per cent during the first four trading days of October. On Wednesday,
it closed down 3.3 per cent, at 38,291. Turnover was slow, at just Dollars
53m.
Resistance in the Sao Paulo business community to Mr Krause and his
henchman, Planning Minister Paulo Haddad, appears to be subsiding. Mr Delfim
Netto, an influential federal legislator from Sao Paulo, chided 'paulistas'
for their regional prejudices against Mr Krause, who comes from the
north-eastern state of Pernambuco, and Mr Haddad, from Mr Franco's native
Minas Gerais region.
The stock market is now waiting for Mr Franco to elaborate his strategy to
attack stagflation, and for details of his views on economic reforms such as
privatisation and trade liberalisation.
The market has been influenced by politics since May, when Mr Collor's
brother publicly accused him of corruption. A subsequent parliamentary
inquiry and the impeachment debate helped to break a bullish streak dating
back to mid-1991, when foreign institutions were allowed to operate directly
in the market. The upsurge made Brazil seem one of the best bets among the
world's emerging markets.
When the political crisis erupted, the market initially reacted as if the
corruption charges would not stick. But around July, as press reports and
the parliamentary inquiry began to uncover evidence of direct presidential
involvement, the mood changed. Soon the market was rising on signs of a
speedy presidential demise, and falling when he seemed to gain strength.
This trend was most acute in late September, prior to the authorisation of
impeachment proceedings and Mr Collor's suspension. Anticipating approval,
the Bovespa index closed up 7.7 per cent on the day of the evening roll
call. With the pre-impeachment surge, the Bovespa index rose by 9.8 per
cent, after adjusting for inflation, in September.
The political element should recede, say many observers, bringing the
economy back to centre stage. 'I think that we are leaving behind the
political climate and getting back to reality,' says Mr Vidigal.
But Mr Roberto Teixeira da Costa, director-president of Brasilpar Financial
Services, believes that the market may continue to reflect the mood of the
government. However, he adds, 'I don't see any big surprises in the Itamar
administration.'
During 'Collorgate', foreign investment maintained a net inflow until
August, albeit at a much slower pace. A net Dollars 1.5bn entered Brazilian
bourses from January to the end of September. But two-thirds of this,
Dollars 991m, was registered by April, before the political crisis. This
compared with Dollars 571m for the whole of 1991. In August, foreigners
siphoned off Dollars 80m more than they sent in.
But in September, they invested a net Dollars 37m, fanning hopes that the
foreign investment ebb may be about to reverse. Figures for early October
are not yet available, but the local subsidiary of Chase Manhattan says that
clients of its omnibus account invested a net Dollars 13m during the first
three days of this week, compared with Dollars 19.2m in the whole of August,
and Dollars 24.5m in September.
Foreigners continue to express interest in Brazil by registering with the
Securities Commission (CVM), as required by law. Through the end of August,
the CVM had 501 institutions on its books; preliminary figures show that a
further 22 won approval in September.
Trading remains concentrated in a handful of blue chip stocks, especially
Telebras, the state-controlled telecommunications company which accounts for
40 per cent of the Bovespa index. On Wednesday, Telebras accounted for 75
per cent of volume.
Mr Franco's statements about 'perfecting' the privatisation programme and
references to unnamed 'strategic' companies have raised doubts about his
intentions towards Telebras. But analysts believe the company's stock is
attractive and say that few investors have expressed concern about the
company's privatisation fortunes under Mr Franco.

FT  09 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late rise in Nikkei
ahead of October options close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDEX-LINKED buying related to the options market lifted share prices in the
late afternoon, and the Nikkei index closed higher in an otherwise
uneventful trading session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed up 223.77 at the day's high of 17,335.51, following
arbitrage unwinding which depressed prices in the morning and pushed it down
to a low of 17,049.75.
Volume fell to 200m shares from 253m. Trading remained thin, yesterday
because market participants were reluctant to trade ahead of Friday's
settlement for October stock index option contracts.
Advances led declines by 471 to 444 with 168 unchanged, the Topix index of
all first section stocks rose 5.60 to 1,304.69 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.02 to 1042.94.
Share prices moved in a tight range before their sharp rise at the end of
the session. Activity centred around short-term trading of speculative
stocks by dealers and individual investors. The fall in the yen against the
dollar also helped some export oriented issues.
Shinagawa Fuel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y1 to Y966. The fuel
dealer gained popularity as an environmental theme stock due to reports on
its research to change plastics into petroleum.
Hitachi Zosen, the shipping company, rose Y17 to Y547 on speculation of
increased orders of its garbage incinerators. Kubota, the farm equipment
maker, which was previously higher on the environmental theme, lost Y6 to
Y591 on profit-taking.
The yen weakened to the Y120 level against the dollar, helping electronics
and car companies. Sony gained Y40 to Y3,930 and Toyota Motor advanced Y20
to Y1,420.
NEC, however, fell Y10 to Y681 on continuing concern over its earnings.
Investors are also currently discouraged by the planned sales of low-cost
personal computers by Compaq, the US computer maker.
Chiyoda, the plant engineering company, rose Y70 to Y1,930 on a report of
its involvement in a major natural gas pipeline project in the Middle East.
Lion, the toiletries maker, rose Y39 to Y611. Investors have started to
target companies which have started to restructure their operations,
including cost-cutting measures in the process.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 40.61 to 18,908.36 in volume of 12.2m shares.
The lack of fresh news prompted small-lot selling.
Roundup
THE region's markets put in mixed performances yesterday.
HONG KONG recovered after falling sharply at the opening, following negative
Chinese reaction to Governor Chris Patten's speech on Wednesday. The Hang
Seng index closed down 33.50 at 5,555.53, after an intraday low of 5,526.37.
Turnover was HKDollars 1.63bn after Wednesday's HKDollars 1.48bn.
HSBC Holdings lost HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 54.50 and Cheung Kong was 20
cents lower at HKDollars 20.30.
TAIWAN ended 2.7 per cent higher following the resignation of the finance
minister over a property tax proposal.
The weighted index, which advanced more than 100 points in early trading,
closed 96.09 higher at 3,688.21. Turnover rose to TDollars 21.2bn from
TDollars 13.1bn.
BANGKOK advanced on bank, finance and securities issues and the SET index
gained 11.36 or 1.3 per cent to 883.36 in turnover of Bt16.6bn.
SEOUL fell on profit-taking with investors remaining nervous about the
political situation. The composite index lost 5.95 to 518.43 as turnover
rose to Won239bn from Won173bn.
MANILA was lower with activity concentrated on secondary commercial stocks
and some profit-taking in blue chips. The composite index shed 3.98 to
1,403.82 in combined turnover of 299m pesos.
AUSTRALIA rose on bargain-hunting, with BHP one of the day's biggest
gainers, up 14 cents to ADollars 11.64. The All Ordinaries Index closed 10.2
higher at 1,465.6 in turnover of ADollars 293m.
NEW ZEALAND was dragged lower by an 8 cent fall in Telecom to NZDollars 2.23
on rumours that a competitor, Clear Communications, had increased its market
share . The NZSE-40 index lost 7.57 to 1,384.64.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Firmer sterling leads longer-dated gilts
higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER-dated UK govern-ment bonds rose about a point yesterday as sterling
firmed, though the gilt market failed to get as much of a lead as some had
hoped from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer.
Mr Lamont failed to provide any real direction to the markets when he
addressed the Tory party conference and attempted to set out the bones of
the government's economic strategy outside the ERM.
At first, gilt prices slipped back, reflecting a two pfennig slide by
sterling. Then they recovered with the pound to show strength at the
longer-dated end.
By the close, long gilt futures were a full point firmer at 96.14 and the
10-year government bond had risen  29/32 to 104-17.
Recovery of the long-dated government bonds was partly sparked by a growing
confidence that Germany was likely to cut rates in the next few weeks.
Dealers said there was overseas demand for the 10-year gilt, particularly
from the US, although trading continued to be thin.
GERMAN government bonds consolidated recent gains as bunds moved within a
narrow band and closed virtually unchanged. There was still some overhang
from Wednesday's auction on new 10-year bonds. One analyst said that too
much inference had been drawn from recent comments by Bundesbank officials
and a rate cut was not as certain as some investors had believed. The bund
futures contract on Liffe was virtually unchanged at 91.12.
SPANISH government bonds experienced a sharp rally yesterday as investors
decided that any devaluation was likely to be smaller than previously
thought.
The market had been discounting a devaluation of about 6 per cent but some
traders argued that this appeared unrealistic, making the benchmark 10-year
bond cheap. There was some covering of short positions and the bond jumped
some three points, with the yield spread against the D-Mark narrowing by as
much as 65 basis points to 595.
ITALY continued to see consolidation with government bonds bouncing back in
early trade, helped by short covering. However, analysts said that the
fundamental situation in Italy continued to be very worrying. Yesterday the
Italian budget minister notified parliament that the government would seek a
confidence vote to secure approval of a L23,800bn package of spending cuts.
Late in the day, the Bank of Italy cut its Lombard rate by half a point to
16 per cent, reflecting the easing of pressure in the money markets and a
partial reversal of the last rate hike on September 4 when the lira was in
the ERM.
IN FRANCE, there was initial disappointment that the central bank did not
follow the recent lead provided by Belgium and Holland and cut interest
rates. The Bank of France said it left its intervention rate unchanged at
9.6 per cent. However, interest picked up later and OATs gained  3/4 of a
point, while the BTANs advanced nearly  1/2 point. Dealers said the inverted
yield curve was far less pronounced, suggesting that the prospects of a rate
cut were growing all the time.
BELGIAN bond markets saw little movement by the close of trade, but the
market managed to hold on to Wednesday's gains. Dutch government bonds
finished a quiet session flat to slightly firmer with the guilder's recent
strength continuing to lend support.
IN TOKYO, Japanese government bonds and futures prices were down from their
Wednesday close but off their lows in late afternoon trade. Faded hopes for
an imminent relaxation of US credit induced selling from dealers, but
moderate short covering lifted prices slightly before the close.
SWEDISH yields for short-dated bonds closed sharply lower as a market
consensus grew that the central bank would continue to cut its key lending
rate from yesterday's 18 per cent.
On Wednesday, the bank lowered its marginal lending rate from 20 per cent
and said earlier it was aiming at levels below that of last summer when it
stood at 11.5 per cent. It did not elaborate on a possible time frame for
further cuts.
US Treasury prices posted solid gains yesterday afternoon after an
undistinguished morning and in spite of an unexpectedly large fall in
initial jobless claims.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 97
5/8 , yielding 7.443 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  3/32
at 100 5/16 , yielding 3.817 per cent.
The day's main economic news was of a 24,000 decline in weekly state
unemployment claims, a much larger than expected fall.
Although prices shed a few points on the news, reports of strong Middle East
buying of seven-year notes helped the market regain most of its lost ground
by midday.
Prices were supported by demand from investors who believed the market had
been oversold in the few days after the Federal Reserve failed to cut
interest rates following a poor September employment report.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bundesbank keeps analysts on
their toes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are times when watching the German central bank 'makes the ancient art
of Kremlinology look like child's play', according to Ms Alison Cottrell, of
Midland Montagu, in her latest commentary on the Bundesbank.
The Bundesbank's money market activities have been particularly perplexing
in the last chaotic month, with the bank attempting to steer rates against a
background of large inflows of cash in the wake of intervention in the
currency markets.
One unequivocal fact is that the Bundesbank has steered rates down by 0.8
per cent in the last month, to below 9 per cent - a reduction which is far
more substantial than the 25 basis point fall in the headline Lombard rate
announced in the middle of last month.
As Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said after last week's
council meeting in Schwerin, money market rates are a more important
indicator of policy than the Lombard rate. At the same time, he announced
that the bank would be introducing a two-week securities repurchase
agreement (repo) tender, giving it more scope to fine-tune money market
rates.
Throughout September, the market picked up mixed signals as the central bank
pursued a number of objectives all at once. Mr Richard Reid, of UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew, says that the monetary authorities were attempting to reduce
tensions in the ERM, neutralise the effects of intervention on domestic
money supply and keep up the battle against inflation - all at the same
time.
The Bundesbank reacted to the excess liquidity - DM92bn of funds flowed into
Germany in September - with a variety of measures, indicating the
Bundesbank's determination to sterilise the impact of intervention on money
supply development. It issued three or two-day bills and currency swaps, and
it cancelled two consecutive repo auctions, last week and the week before.
The picture was confused on Wednesday and Friday last week, when the
Bundesbank pumped funds back into the market under its so-called Paragraph
17 provisions. It was thus injecting liquidity within days of taking it out
of the market - 'providing a heap of chickens' entrails for analysts,' says
Ms Cottrell.
Mr Schlesinger's comments on Friday cleared the air somewhat: he said that
the aim was to keep rates down to below 9 per cent for the time being, and
that he was happy with the orientation of monetary policy. The money market
rate was where it should be: midway between the Lombard rate at 9.5 per cent
and the Discount rate at 8.25 per cent.
The important question is whether the fall in money market rates presages
further, more substantial cuts in the internationally sensitive Lombard
rate. This would be an indication that German interest rates were on the way
down, after the grudging  1/4 point cut under political pressure last month.
Analysts say that with interest rates as they are, the Lombard rate could be
cut by 0.25 per cent. But Mr Thomas Mayer, of Goldman Sachs, says that it is
extremely unlikely the Lombard rate will be lowered at all this year -
unless there is another currency crisis. By leaving the large gap between
call money and the Lombard rate, the Bundesbank is indicating that its next
move could be to steer money rates up, just as well as down.
As Mr Johann Gaddum, member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council,
indicated yesterday, the bank had no intention of relaxing its battle
against inflation in Germany. It is unlikely to find excuses for a cut in
interest rates in money supply growth for September. Bloated by
intervention, growth is likely to be around 10 per cent, compared to a
target of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Bonds: EIB establishes benchmark for French
franc paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank yesterday brought the first substantial
offering in the Euro-French franc market since August, when the market
virtually closed due to worries over the French referendum on Maastricht in
September.
The EIB was keen to re-establish a benchmark in the sector, since trading in
its paper was disrupted by the change in Italian tax treatment of EIB paper
last month. Under the new tax rules, new EIB paper is no longer exempt from
withholding tax for Italian investors, and old EIB paper does not benefit
from the exemption if traded in the repo market.
Prior to the change, some EIB paper was trading at yields substantially
lower than French OATs, but spreads widened by as much as 50 basis points as
a wave of paper hit the market.
The new deal, a FFr2bn 10-year offering arranged by Societe Generale, was
priced to yield 34 basis points over the comparable French government bond.
The deal was priced at the same level as French government guaranteed paper
launched in the domestic market. Dealers said the issue, which incorporates
a delayed rate settlement structure, met strong demand.
Meanwhile, liquidity in the Euro-French franc market has improved in recent
days, as short-term rates eased. Following the referendum, overnight rates
as high as 24 per cent made it extremely expensive for banks to fund
inventory, causing liquidity to dry up. However, the overnight rate fell to
11 7/8 per cent yesterday. 'The market is not yet back to normal, but
conditions are improving,' said one trader.
Three new issues totalling SFr1bn emerged yesterday in the Swiss franc bond
market, which has benefited from its status as a safe haven during the
recent turmoil in European financial markets.
The issues were spread across a range of maturities, which helped the market
to absorb unusually heavy supply, in addition to two 12-year domestic bond
issues by Swiss utilities totalling SFr200m.
The World Bank launched a large SFr500m offering of 6 1/4 per cent
seven-year bonds, via Union Bank of Switzerland, which dealers said was
rather aggressively priced. In addition, Belgium launched a SFr200m
five-year deal via Credit Suisse and Ostterreichische Kontrollbank raised
SFr300m of 10-year bonds via Swiss Bank Corporation.
Swiss bond yields have fallen by about  1/2 point since last month, as
investors have shifted assets into the Swiss market. A number of other
borrowers are taking price indications for transactions in the sector, but
some believe rates still have further to fall.
The Britannia Building Society added a further Pounds 50m tranche of 13 per
cent Permanent Interest Bearing Shares (Pibs) to its Pounds 60m issue. The
shares offer a yield at issue price of 280 basis points over the 9 per cent
gilt due 2008.
The issue of undated mandatorily convertible subordinated notes launched
last January were converted into notes on August 1, following shareholder
approval at the society's annual general meeting.

<TEXT>
Sir, You report the Department of Trade and Industry's interest in bringing
greater efficiency into trade associations ('Ministers query cost of trade
groups', October 5). We in the coatings industry (Pounds 2bn annual
turnover) are streamlining our services to provide better value to our
member companies. My association is following the federation route by
incorporating the Printing Ink Manufacturers from January 1 while enabling
existing paint, powder coatings and wall-covering activities to flourish
within a single organisation. There is also regular co-operation with
kindred associations on individual matters of mutual interest where
collaborative effort is economical and provides comprehensive industry input
to government.
Individual companies will continue to support and belong to such clearly
defined and appropriate trade groupings, in which their detailed technical
and trade interests can be identified and serviced by experts.
There is a sense of deja-vu in your report as the business of trade
representation has been examined on several occasions in the past. The
logical conclusion of the 'bigger is better' argument is that companies
become direct members of the Confederation of British Industry and that the
specialist sector associations close down. This might suit Mr Heseltine's
mandarins but nobody else]

Sir, Your leader, 'Rational roads' (September 29), makes a good case for
road pricing but misses one key target. The growth in goods traffic by road
is fuelled by the switch to 'just-in-time' manufacturing. A good part of the
benefits of this scheme stem from an outrageous ploy to externalise the
costs of stock holding. Firms are in effect dumping their stock costs on the
street, where congestion and accidents are paid for by other road users.
True economic efficiency calls for fierce charges on goods transport by
road, under the slogan: kanban plus vanban]

FT  09 OCT 92 / Personal View: How to repair the Anglo-German rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HELMUT SCHMIDT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the relationship between the British and Germans, something has gone
badly awry. The primary source of discord is money. But currency matters are
also questions of politics. As a result, the pound's collapse has sent the
Anglo-German political barometer plunging.
We must try to avoid the storm turning into a permanent climatic downturn.
It is time that the British government and the Bank of England - as well as
the newspapers in both countries - become aware of the political damage
wrought by thoughtlessness on both sides.
For some important causes of the dispute, we must turn to Germany. There are
sharp discrepancies between the fiscal policies of the government and the
monetary policy of the Bundesbank. The differences have their roots in
Bonn's decision in 1990 - against the advice of the then Bundesbank
president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl - to introduce the D-Mark into East Germany at
a rate which amounted to a large revaluation of the East German mark. The
apparently generous one-for-one conversion rate was one of the reasons for
the speedy collapse of the East German economy, leading to large financial
demands from the east and enormous German public-sector borrowing.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, stresses that growth in the borrowing
requirement of German central government has been relatively small. At best,
this is naive self-deception. If we include all the special funding vehicles
introduced since unification, as well as the budgets of the states (Lander)
and municipalities, it is clear that public-sector borrowing is still
accelerating.
This unparalleled call upon private savings both in Germany and abroad
represents a burden on badly needed corporate investment and on residential
construction. Additionally, since the proceeds of the loans are channelled
above all into consumption in eastern Germany, long-term capital is
effectively being converted into cash spent on consumer goods.
The increase in money in circulation has understandably unsettled the
Bundesbank, which long warned of the consequences of Bonn's apparently
'painless' fiscal policies. This was the fundamental reason for Mr Pohl's
resignation last year. The Bundesbank has been trying to use high interest
rates to keep money supply under control - without success, because high
D-Mark interest rates have attracted considerable amounts of foreign
liquidity to Germany.
The Bundesbank has thus itself contributed to the increase in the money
supply, and has also brought the D-Mark under revaluation pressure. Last
month central banks sought, through massive intervention, to avoid the
devaluation of other European currencies. In the case of sterling and the
lira, this was unsuccessful. But the transactions of the Bundesbank and
other central banks nonetheless led to a gross increase in domestic D-Mark
liquidity (before allowing for money market sterilisation) of about DM100bn
during the past few weeks.
The Bundesbank council must now concede that its tight money policy has been
counterproductive. Germany's monetary watchdog has bitten its own tail. The
Bundesbank's monetary policies are powerless to counter the inflationary
impact of Germany's overall public sector deficits. With record interest
rates, however, the Bundesbank can deepen the recession. A dramatic
resignation of the Bundesbank president would, perhaps, do more to bring
about a fiscal about-turn than a continuation of monetary strangulation.
The present gulf between monetary and fiscal policy is unparalleled since
the foundation of the federal republic in 1949. The main blame lies with the
federal government. It must recognise that budgetary spending, subsidies and
tax allowances must all be cut - in areas from defence expenditure to
agriculture.
If further funding is still needed, then tax increases must take priority
over a further rise in indebtedness. A vital condition for this change in
course is the successful conclusion of the 'solidarity pact' Chancellor
Helmut Kohl is trying to negotiate with trade unions and employers to hold
down the costs of unity.
What are the lessons for the UK? With enormous effort and sacrifice, Britain
won the war against Hitler's Greater Germany. Since then, however, Britain's
economic prowess, relative to international competitors, has gradually but
continuously fallen. France, Germany and other countries long ago exceeded
its per capita economic output.
Britain's chancellor has made 'speculators' responsible for pressure on
sterling. He also blamed Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president,
whom he accused of provoking speculation through indiscreet comments. This
sparked off a journalistic and political broadside against Germany; the
German counter-fire was hardly less wounding.
It is true that, on the money markets and foreign exchanges, speculators are
indeed at work. Constant rumour-mongering leads to a climate bordering on
mass hysteria. That is one reason why fixed exchange rates are preferable.
Such a system was in force until 1973 for the entire industrialised world.
In a modified form, fixed rates have also been in place since 1979 in Europe
as a result of the European Monetary System. Of course, the rules of such a
system foresee occasional changes in parities when economic fundamentals are
no longer in equilibrium. Up to last month's realignment, EMS governments
kept exchange rates fixed for several years, above all for prestige reasons
 -a motivation which particularly guided the British government.
Mr John Major and his chancellor are not magicians. In the short time since
Britain became a full EMS member in October 1990, they have not been able to
improve the fundamental state of the British economy. So their resolute
attempt to maintain the sterling parity was doomed, sooner or later, to fail
 -corresponding to the pattern of the past 40 years. I only hope the search
for German scapegoats soon gives way to good old-fashioned British
commonsense.
The Germans must also find their way back to the path of reason. They must
learn to avoid arrogance. They must restrain themselves from making
indiscreet remarks in interviews, even when these comments happen to be
factually correct. Criticism may be directed at the UK government. But I
must emphasise that, as a consequence of their budget policies, the German
chancellor and his finance minister are also in the dock.
The Bundesbank has to realise that the rise in the D-Mark is damaging
Germany's exports. And the central bank's president and vice-president must
learn the art of discretion; they have handed too many cheap arguments to
British opponents of Maastricht. Above all, everyone must realise that
monetary policy is also foreign policy. If we are to avoid further
misfortune, all concerned should conduct themselves accordingly.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Letter: Unilever chief urges industry to endorse Maastricht
ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write to express Unilever's views on the ratification of the
Maastricht treaty.
We strongly believe that ratification should be firmly endorsed by business
and industry throughout Europe, and that organisations within member states,
such as the Confederation of British Industry, should actively support their
governments through the local ratification process.
Unilever is a global business, but some 60 per cent of our sales still take
place within our European heartland. Unilever believes that failure to
ratify the Maastricht treaty would represent a big setback in the continuous
process of establishing a strong and competitive Europe within the world
economic order.
The formalisation of the single European market in January 1993 represents a
new milestone in the rationalisation of our European markets, and it will
undoubtedly bring significant benefits to our customers throughout Europe,
notably in the form of greater efficiencies and reduced costs.
The Maastricht treaty, as now drafted, builds on that achievement.
Specifically, it provides for the evolution of a political and monetary
framework which will enhance and enable the even more effective working of
the single European market. Like all such treaties, it embodies compromises
and trade-offs designed to address the circumstances and concerns of
individual member states. Taken as a whole, however, it is undoubtedly good
for Europe.
As a leading international company with a base in the UK, Unilever would
also wish to make its views clear on the British position. We note the
specific exceptions which were negotiated by the prime minister at
Maastricht, and we believe they address widely held British views. The
treaty is good for Britain and we should endorse it.
More important, however, is the fact that if the process of ratification in
Britain were to fail, the position of Britain within Europe would be gravely
damaged. Whether or not other member states decided to proceed without us,
our political and economic isolation would increase dramatically, and our
business competitiveness both within Europe and in world markets would be
seriously threatened. Britain's status as a preferred location for inward
investment to Europe would be at risk, and the competitiveness of our goods
and services in world markets would be progressively eroded.
Seen from a world perspective, Britain is self-evidently a part of Europe,
and our future is heavily dependent on forging ever stronger economic links
with our European neighbours.

Unfortunately, the little critters quickly wised up to this trick and far

He is happy to swallow his own bait to prove that it is harmless and

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading citizens of Hong Kong are somewhat bemused by Chris Patten. While
basking in esteem as a reforming governor, he has taken to regaling
breakfast guests at Government House with a poem - 'In a large Greek Colony,
200 BC' - which perhaps suggests that the governor does not expect his
popularity to last.
True, the poet - Constantine Cavafy, who died in 1933 - begins by saying
'more than a few believe the time has come to bring in a political
reformer'. But he then warns that 'they make a tremendous fuss about
everything,' and adds:
'They probe everywhere, question the smallest detail, and right away think
up radical changes that demand immediate execution . . . And as they proceed
with their investigation, they find an endless number of useless things to
eliminate - things that are, however, difficult to get rid of.'
Hence by the time 'they retire (also taking the wages due to them), it's a
wonder anything's left at all after such surgical efficiency'. Accordingly,
the poet concludes, 'maybe the moment hasn't arrived yet'.
For the benefit of any Government House breakfaster who is treated to
Patten's recitation and can't think of a suitable response, Observer has
consulted the FT's specialist on clipping culture vultures' wings. The
correct reply, he says, is:
'But it doesn't rhyme.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / Observer: Paltzer's how-to
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bottom of a recession would not seem to be the best time to launch yet
another Do-it-Yourself magazine on to a depressed UK magazine market. But
Swiss born publisher Rolf Paltzer is confident that he's got his timing spot
on with his first magazine Here's How.
He's no stranger to British magazines. In the 1980s he turned the women's
magazine market on its head when working for Gruner and Jahr, the German
publishers. In 1986 he launched Prima and a year later Best, proving that a
newcomer with a different idea can conquer the competition even in a mature
market.
But it is one thing entering the UK market with the backing of a German
publishing giant. It is quite another doing it as an independent. However,
the 42-year-old Paltzer, who quit G&amp;J a couple of years ago, thinks he's
spotted a gap: 'There's nothing between brick-laying and soft furnishing.'
The market is ready for an idiot-proof guide, he tells me.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Observer: No retreat for Norman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the monk's cell was ready and waiting, Norman Lamont has decided
not, after all, to go into retreat.
The monastic community in question is Mount Athos in northern Greece, where
the chancellor of the exchequer had been invited by Greek central bank
governor Efthymios Christodoulou for a sojourn over the weekend after his
make-or-break conference speech.
However tempting the option might have seemed in theory, Lamont declined on
the grounds of pressure of work. But in reality he may have been put off by
John Gummer who took a trip to Mount Athos recently in the company of
Sotiris Kouvelas, minister to the premier's office and reputedly the most
devout member of the cabinet.
The community, once a safe but austere refuge for Orthodox Christians in
political disgrace, is still no place for the faint-hearted. The holy
mountain's 20-odd monasteries still run on Byzantine time, which plays havoc
with meals. The menu is usually beans and wine - meat is also banned.
Pilgrims are supposed to walk from one part of the complex to another.
What's more, there is a strict ban on females of any species, which is more
than can be said for the Cambridge Union, where Lamont is billed to speak
next Friday on a motion that 'Labour and the economy do not mix'.
Interesting to see whether he cancels this engagement too.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Letter: Free from football 'slavery'
</HEADLINE>

   From Dr A J BERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many football supporters, and perhaps some managers, might occasionally
recognise Observer's description of some football players as intangible
assets ('Numbers game', October 7).
However, the assertion that investors 'own' 197p of players for each share
seems to contravene the anti-slavery laws, where it becomes illegal for one
person to 'own' another person. A great deal of the impetus for human asset
accounting failed the anti-slavery test.
The whole contract-transfer system in football should also be abolished,
freeing players to sell themselves in this labour market and encouraging
employers to have less ownership and perhaps more respect for the players.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Leigh-Pemberton defends tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPIRITED defence of Britain's tactics in attempting to keep the pound
within the ERM was made last night by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of
the Bank of England.
Speaking in Cambridgeshire, he said Britain did all it could to defend the
pound by concerted Bank intervention in currency markets.
Any decision to raise rates earlier than Black Wednesday on September 16 -
when sterling was forced to leave the ERM - would have been seen as
'quixotic' given the depth of the recession.
He said a decision prior to Black Wednesday for Britain to have devalued
sterling within the ERM - perhaps by joining the realignment early last
month in which the lira was devalued - would not have made sense as the
pound was not overvalued against other European currencies.
The governor said an overriding reason for the currency turbulence was high
German interest rates forcing up the D-Mark, a sequence of events prompted
by the largely unforeseen inflationary pressures of German unification.
'I am not persuaded by the view - expressed more frequently with the benefit
of hindsight - that we should have seen the writing on the wall much earlier
and drawn the appropriate conclusion at that time,' he said.
The governor defended the Bank's intervention to prop up the pound only
relatively late in September when sterling was already weak. Intervention on
a big scale earlier 'would have hastened rather than postponed the
collapse'.
He also said raising interest rates earlier in September or the previous
month in an effort to hold up the pound would not have had the intended
effect.
'Raising UK interest rates, when the economy was so weak and inflationary
pressure so subdued . . . would have been regarded not just by the financial
markets, but by the world as a whole, as transparently perverse.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / Chancellor moves to plug economic policy gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont's new monetary policy won few fans in Brighton yesterday.
The Conservative Conference gave the chancellor a brief standing ovation
that was loyally correct but far from enthusiastic, while the City's
immediate response was to mark sterling down by 2 pfennigs.
But the policy to fill the gaping hole in monetary discipline caused by
withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism contains two
potentially far-reaching innovations.
For the first time, a British government is setting an explicit inflation
target: of 1 per cent to 4 per cent for retail prices excluding mortgage
interest payments.
In a nation where policymaking is normally shrouded in secrecy, the
chancellor has promised to make monetary policy more accountable. If
inflation moves outside the targeted range, Mr Lamont has committed the
government to giving a full explanation to parliament and the markets of
what has gone wrong and how it plans to correct matters.
The Treasury and the Bank of England hope these elements will help establish
credibility. For in other aspects the plans in Mr Lamont's speech and in a
letter to Mr John Watts, the chairman of the Commons Treasury and Civil
Service committee, are a rerun of Tory policy in the mid 1980s.
Then as now, policy was guided by a number of monetary indicators and
tempered by Treasury judgment. That approach was abandoned in 1987 by Mr
Nigel Lawson in favour of shadowing the D-Mark, then replaced with
sterling's ill-fated membership of the ERM.
Mr Lamont promised yesterday that the government would look at monetary
aggregates; asset prices, including house prices; and the exchange rate in
determining when and by how much it should alter interest rates. That will
be backed by 'the tightest control of public spending'.
But the chancellor's letter to Mr Watts emphasised that there would be no
question of making monetary policy on automatic pilot. Judgment will affect
the very cornerstone of policy. 'The strength or weakness of the economy
will affect the pace' at which the UK moves towards its long-term objective
on inflation.
Similarly, on the exchange rate, there will be no target range nor any
shadowing of another currency. On the other hand, the government will not
let the exchange rate 'go where it will'. The chancellor said: 'The test is
whether we believe a movement in the exchange rate (as defined by the
sterling exchange-rate index) or a particular level of it, sustained for a
period, is likely to jeopardise the inflation objective.'
Mr Lamont is wary of the indicators that will help to underpin his policies.
M0, the narrow measure of money supply which the government targets, is
behaving itself and is close to the centre of its 0 per cent to 4 per cent
target growth range. His letter admits that M0, which comprises mainly notes
and coin in circulation, 'is limited to providing a timely guide to current
behaviour in the economy'.
Past experience suggests that it would be unwise to establish a formal
target for M4, the broad money measure. Instead, Mr Lamont will announce
'monitoring ranges' for M4 beyond which its movement would be 'increasing
cause for concern' in next month's Autumn Statement.
The Bank and Treasury will study various weighted broad money indices, such
as the Divisia index, which has followers in the City. Mr Lamont said it was
too early, though, to give such measures a formal place in the way monetary
conditions are assessed. He will also monitor asset prices, particularly
when house prices are falling or accelerating sharply.
Mr Lamont's guarded exposition of his new policy reflects a realisation
among policymakers that there is no magic formula for operating monetary
policy. That was acknowledged last night by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
governor of the Bank of England, in a speech in Cambridgeshire.
Yesterday's explanations of the mechanics of the new monetary policy gave
the markets little clear guidance. Indeed, any trader watching the
chancellor's speech on television could be forgiven for thinking that the UK
economy was again to be steered by seat-of-the-pants judgments.
The inflation targets detailed in the chancellor's letter showed that
monetary policy would be tight, and tended to bear out Mr Lamont's claim
that the government intends to take no risks with inflation.
By past standards, the inflation targets are ambitious. The annual rate of
retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, was 4.2 per
cent in August and has never been lower than 3.1 per cent. On the other
hand, the economy is so depressed that an underlying inflation rate of 2 per
cent or less 'in the long term' should be achievable.
In the short term, however, there is no way that the speakers who called for
interest rate cuts of 2, 3 or 5 percentage points yesterday will have their
wishes granted. In one important respect, leaving the ERM has not changed
policy. The inflation targets mean that a substantial cut in UK interest
rates will have to wait for a clear easing of monetary conditions in
Germany.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Lamont's letter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The main points of proposals to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service
committee
The European exchange rate mechanism: Britain will resume membership but
only when a number of conditions have been satisfied, including an end to
turbulence on currency markets and a narrowing in the difference in interest
rates between Germany and the US. Those conditions are unlikely to be
satisfied soon.
Inflation: Britain needs to aim for a rate of inflation in the long term of
2 per cent or less. For the remainder of the current parliament, Britain
should keep underlying inflation (based on the year-on-year growth in the
retail-prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments) within a range of
1 per cent to 4 per cent.
Special circumstances affecting prices: We have to acknowledge that events
outside our control may take us temporarily outside the range. That could
arise, for example, if there were a sharp movement in the terms of trade,
particularly through commodity prices.
Monetary policy: The government will judge inflationary trends according to
a wide range of factors, including domestic monetary targets. There will be
a general emphasis on reaching a judgment on inflationary trends and whether
the government's objectives are likely to be achieved.
Exchange rate: The Treasury will give full weight to the exchange rate in
assessing monetary conditions, but there will be no target range for the
pound. Equally, the exchange rate will not be allowed to go where it will.
The lesson from the 1980s is that exchange rates can move a long way,
upwards or downwards, if markets come to believe the authorities do not
care.
Narrow measure of money supply (M0): The target for M0 - year-on-year growth
of 0 to 4 per cent - will be retained. M0 has proved a reliable indicator
and its relationship with current spending in the economy has proved
remarkably stable.
Broad money measure (M4): M4 contains important information on monetary
conditions. But experience indicates that the relationship between these
aggregates and either money GDP or future inflation is not close enough to
justify establishing M4 as a formal target. The government is to give some
idea in the Autumn Statement of the values for the growth of M4 which may
indicate a build-up of inflationary pressures.
Composite monetary indicators: It is premature to give such indices a formal
place in the system of monetary assessment, but the Bank of England and
Treasury will be looking at them further.
Other indicators of inflation: The Treasury will monitor money market
interest rates, and asset prices including house prices. Officials will pay
particular attention to periods when house prices are falling or
accelerating sharply.
Fiscal policy: If industry is to be able to take advantage of the
opportunities the lower exchange rate has now presented, it will be
essential to keep tight control over public spending and borrowing. The
government will be seeking to maintain firm downward pressure on the growth
of public-sector pay. This will also ensure that the public sector matches
industry's efforts to contain its own wage costs and so hang on to the
improved competitiveness. The government will also pursue a tight policy on
public spending.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Egypt presses Israelis on talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL announced a concession on Middle East peace talks last night after a
visit at short notice by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israel had agreed that Palestinians from
outside the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip could take part in regional
talks that run in parallel to the main peace negotiations. But the
Palestinians must not be members of the Palestine National Council or from
East Jerusalem, Mr Peres added.
The shift was seen as a gesture towards improving the atmosphere at the
bilateral negotiations under way for almost a year between Israel and,
respectively, Syria, the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon.
On his return to Cairo Mr Moussa said he expected the Israeli team
negotiating self-rule with the Palestinians to be given new orders to push
the talks forward.
Mr Moussa apparently made an effort to persuade Israeli leaders to make
commitments to withdraw from occupied Arab lands as a way to ensure progress
at the peace negotiations, which are due to resume in Washington later this
month.
'We are trying to build confidence,' Mr Moussa said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ANGOLAN President Jose Eduardo dos Santos last night urged his civil war foe
Jonas Savimbi to put aside doubts about last week's elections and help
rebuild the country. He said he was seeking a meeting with Mr Savimbi, who
has retreated to a stronghold 500km from Luanda.
The president's conciliatory remarks came as the US said it had assurances
from the Unita rebel movement that Mr Savimbi, who alleged fraud in the
elections, would abide by the result and not resume the war.
In his first statement since the poll, Mr dos Santos said there was a lot of
anxiety in the country and 'anybody returning to war would meet the
condemnation of the international community and the Angolan people.'
He said the sympathisers of Unita and other parties 'should know that they
have an indispensable role to play in the reconstruction of the country.'
In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen, said Mr Savimbi's
aides had said he would concede defeat. 'I've had some private assurances
from some senior associates of Mr Savimbi in the last days that they will
abide by the results,' Mr Cohen said.

FT  09 OCT 92 / China taking fast lane to economic reform: The first party
conference since Tiananmen Square opens next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT Monday the 1,991 Communist Party officials who govern China's 1.2bn
people gather in Beijing for the party's five-yearly conference. They will
elect 20 men and women who will have day-to-day responsibility for China's
development over the next five years.
This is the first meeting of the party since June 4, 1989, when the People's
Liberation Army suppressed pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square,
leaving hundreds, perhaps thousands, dead and China's international image in
tatters. Yet, as the delegates assemble in the Great Hall of the People,
located on that square, they can be forgiven for feeling a little smug.
Three years after the blood letting in Tiananmen, life has returned to a
semblance of normality and the economy is growing rapidly. Foreigners, whose
governments shunned China's leaders, are scrambling over themselves to
invest; tourists are returning in droves.
Internationally, China has regained much of what was lost in the immediate
aftermath of Tiananmen. Most sanctions have been lifted; this year alone
diplomatic relations have been opened with Israel, a host of central Asian
republics, and, most recently, South Korea. Later this month Emperor Akihito
of Japan will pay a state visit.
The collapse of the Soviet Union last year, however, looms large over next
week's congress, the 14th in the party's 71-year history. It left China
standing exposed as the last communist state of any consequence. The
nation's leaders, secluded behind the high walls of Zhongnanhai, Beijing's
Kremlin, were reduced to a state of shock.
Deng Xiaoping, the 88-year-old senior leader, seized the moment. The lessons
he was quick to learn from the Soviet Union's demise were distilled in an
internal party document circulated after his tour of southern China in
January. Deng said economic reform had to be pursued vigorously and living
standards raised if the Communist Party was to retain power; at the same
time social and political controls had to be strengthened.
In short, Deng gave a ringing endorsement to perestroika without glasnost.
Few analysts hold out any hope that the congress will initiate any political
reforms; it is expected to focus on the economy and its further
deregulation.
The results of the past 13 years of reform, as Deng has pointed out, have
astonished the world. China's economy has more than doubled in size. On
current trends it will double again by the end of the century.
Last year real gross domestic product grew by 7 per cent. This year, after
three years of self-imposed restraint, it may well rise by more than 10 per
cent. Moreover, the congress is expected to endorse plans for the rapid
modernisation of the economy. This may well be translated into a target of 9
per cent or 10 per cent annual growth for the rest of the decade.
During the first half of 1992, China's annual growth rate was more than 12
per cent. Industrial production rose by 18 per cent a year; consumer
spending was up 14 per cent. The rapid growth in the economy was, however,
fuelling inflation and harming the balance of payments.
By the middle of this year China's inflation rate was rising by 5 percentage
points a year. The national figures, however, disguise inflationary
pressures in the cities, where politically they matter most. Challenges to
the central government's authority have traditionally been most strong in
the cities at times of high inflation.
For the first half of the year, prices were rising in the big cities at more
than 15 per cent a year. Since June they have been growing at up to 20 per
cent. This year's acceleration in the inflation rate has raised fears that
China may be experiencing another of its 'boom-bust' economic cycles. The
last 'bust' was in 1988/89 when credit was virtually halted and growth
dropped sharply.
The extent to which the inflation reflects excess of demand and/or
structural supply rigidities in the economy - as it did in 1988 - or the
effects of price reform is difficult to determine. Already this year China
has lifted price controls on 648 types of industrial commodities, from high
quality steel to glass and some machinery parts, leaving 89 subject to
control.
As rapid growth took off this year, imports began to rise and the surplus on
China's trade account of the balance of payments began to contract. In the
first six months of this year, China's trade surplus was running at an
annual rate of Dollars 5bn, compared with Dollars 8bn in 1991 and Dollars
8.7bn in 1990. On current trends, China could have a trade deficit in 1993.
The prospect of a trade deficit should not, in theory, give rise to concern.
For a developing country like China, a current account deficit can be
desirable if imports go to improving the nation's infrastructure and not to
satisfying consumer desires. Moreover, with foreign reserves of more than
Dollars 40bn, such a deficit should be manageable.
There is, however, anecdotal evidence that part of the import bill is going
towards satisfying consumer needs. In Hong Kong, Mercedes Benz cars are
disappearing from the streets at the rate of three a day to be smuggled by
high speed boats to China.
In spite of the successes of the past 13 years, however, the legacy of
central planning and Mao's penchant for massive industrial complexes - the
Chinese version of 'Stalinist giantism' - weighs heavily on the economy.
State industry, a third of which could be profitable, still accounts for
more than 50 per cent of China's industrial output. This industry - which in
1980 accounted for around 75 per cent of industrial output - is growing
painfully slowly and is dependent for its survival on subsidies.
Over the six years to 1991 the industrial output of state industries grew by
about 7.5 per cent a year. This compares with 50 per cent growth a year for
private and foreign-funded companies and about 18 per cent a year for
collectively-owned companies - enterprises run at the village or township
level and outside the control of the central government.
But instead of dealing with state industry - much of which in a rational
economy would be shut down - there are signs that the government has simply
shifted the burden of subsidies from the budget to the banking system, or,
equally worrying, has been powerless to stop the banks from lending.
Investment by state companies in fixed assets by mid-year was growing at an
annual rate of more than 35 per cent, fuelled by loans by state banks which
totalled Yuan125.6bn (Pounds 13bn) - more than twice the planned level of
advances of Yn60bn. This investment has led to higher output, but how much
of it found its way to market is moot. By the end of June stockpiles of
unsold goods produced by state companies stood at Yn139bn, 23 per cent
higher than at the beginning of the year.
The behaviour of the banking system also underlines one of the central
weakness of reform: China has few levers of macro-economic management. This
is the consequence of an unprecedented decentralisation of economic
decision-making without any strengthening of central government
macro-economic controls.
Beijing has done little to develop a proper banking system and monetary
policy: interest rates are virtually meaningless and quantitative controls
on credit have weakened in the face of pressures provincial leaders put on
bank managers to lend to local industry.
On his tour of southern China earlier this year, Deng enunciated a set of
ideas which are expected to be enshrined by next week's congress. The most
important is that of the 'socialist market economy'. This gives theoretical
justification to many of the changes planned, especially in the area of
state industry and the further deregulation of prices.
The congress is expected to redefine state industry from being 'state-run'
to 'state-owned'. . This will pave the way for a separation of ownership
from management.
Managers will become 'independent' from their controlling ministry; managers
will be given complete control over business policy, including remuneration
and the hiring, firing and promotion of employees. Significantly, the party
will permit company insolvencies.
China will also press ahead with share ownership and the development of
capital markets; it may also encourage the development of large scale
industrial groups.
Since the mid-1980s many foreign economists involved in advising China have
been suggesting ways for it to reform the state sector. The creation of
profit-seeking, rather than output-oriented, enterprise groups is one idea
that gained widespread support and it is a model that may be endorsed by the
congress.
Price reform is also expected to be embraced. With the economy growing
strongly and incomes rising, it is thought that now is the best time to push
ahead with reform of prices.
These are some of the areas which China's leaders are expected to attack.
But crucially in a country like China were the person is as important as the
policy, the composition of the leadership will determine the vigour with
which the plans are enacted. Next week, reformists may get their policies
accepted on paper, but unless they emerge dominant from the congress they
may find them very difficult to carry out.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENTS of the Commonwealth of Independent States, fearing Tajikistan's
worsening war and the growing influence of its Islamic groups, plan to
deploy a peacekeeping force to separate the combatants, officials in
Dushanbe said yesterday.
The fighting, which has killed more than 2,000 people this year, paralysed
the local economy and left the government in chaos, is a main topic at a CIS
presidential summit which starts today in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan's
neighbour, which is potentially threatened by the violence.
Tajikistan's combatants have agreed to accept a peacekeeping force from
Kyrgyzstan, political leaders said in interviews. But, a month after a coup
removed hardline President Rakhmon Nabiyev, the Commonwealth's south-eastern
corner still seems unlikely to stabilise soon.
Diplomats say this is partly because arms are flowing in to each side from
Afghanistan and elsewhere, and neither is likely to surrender when power is
at stake.
Both sides have become only more polarised in recent weeks, as Islamic
leaders behind the new government have largely marginalised their secular
allies in the former opposition to Mr Nabiyev. Now, Tajikistan's most
powerful political forces are the republic's paramount Moslem leader, Qazi
(judge) Akhbar Toradzon Zoda, and the Islamic Renaissance party.
The attempt to pacify Tajikistan follows more than a year of upheaval. In
May, Mr Nabiyev surrendered one-third of his 24-member cabinet to the
opposition after a bloody, 51-day standoff in Dushanbe. Immediately
afterward, however, ethnic warfare broke out between regions loyal to the
competing political sides. On September 7, Mr Nabiyev was lured to Dushanbe
Airport, where armed men from a group calling itself Tajikistan Youth forced
him to resign. Fighting escalated, despite his removal.
A key concern of Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been release of the
beleaguered 201st CIS division, which has been trapped by the fighting.
The fighting has alarmed Mr Islam Karimov, the Uzbekistan president, who has
tightened the border considerably in recent weeks. Rail services from
Uzbekistan have been halted, except for trains from Moscow.
The chief aim of the proposed peacekeeping force is to dislodge the warring
forces from the southern region of Kurgan-Tyube, where almost all the
fighting has taken place. Villages near the region have emptied, as tens of
thousands of refugees have fled.
The Kyrgyz force would be deployed in two areas, according to Mr Shadman
Usupov, chairman of Tajikistan's Democratic party - the town of Kaleninabad,
north of Kurgan-Tyube, and at the Sharshar Pass, just north of the southern
region of Kulyab, a stronghold of Mr Nabiyev.
Tajikistan was left without a national army when the Soviet Union dissolved
last December. The new government is being defended by combined forces loyal
to the IRP and Mr Zoda, the Islamic leader. Their forces are mostly from the
eastern region of Garm, and have received hundreds of guns from Afghan
rebels, military officials say.
The anti-government side is composed almost entirely of men from Kulyab, and
has been armed in the past from government caches. Other weapons have come
from CIS arsenals. Two weeks ago, for example, anti-government forces stole
four Soviet tanks and six other armoured vehicles from the 201st.
'We cannot be safe when any gang can take a tank and destroy a city or a
village,' said Tajikistan's deputy KGB chief, Mr Jurabek Aminov.

<TEXT>
MR CHRIS PATTEN, Hong Kong's governor, was on a collision course with China
last night after Beijing's foreign ministry said his proposals for Hong
Kong's political development were deeply disturbing and would present
obstacles to the smooth transfer of government in 1997.
Wu Jianmin, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Mr Patten's plans for the
colony's 1995 elections were in breech of the 1984 Anglo-Chinese Joint
Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law, the Beijing-drafted constitution for
Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
'They will surely present obstacles to Hong Kong's smooth transition and
transfer of government. The Chinese side is deeply disturbed about this,' he
said.
On Wednesday, in an address to the local legislature, the governor proposed
enlarging the franchise of the colony's voters in the 1995 elections. He
drew short of advocating more than the 20 directly elected seats envisaged
for the 60-member council in 1995, but sketched plans for making the
election of the other 40 seats more democratic and open.
Wu said China wished to point out that Beijing would not be held responsible
for the consequences if the evolution of Hong Kong's political system did
not accord with China's laws. He was critical of Mr Patten publicising plans
before consulting China.
At a public meeting last night Mr Patten, in the knowledge of Beijing's
statement, denied that his plans violated bilateral Anglo-Chinese
agreements.
'The proposals I made are entirely consistent with the Basic Law and the
Joint Declaration in every particular,' he said to the applause from an
audience of Hong Kong citizens.
Earlier in the day, Mr Patten said his proposals for democratic reform must
be decided by early next year. He said he hoped discussions with China would
not be drawn out. During his first 'question time' before local legislators,
Mr Patten spelt out what his government would do if agreement with China
could not be reached about the financing of the colony's airport project.
He said the government would have to look at some 'fairly radical options'.
One would be to complete works that could be financed internally by the
government and leave other matters to be completed by the post-1997
government, he said.
This would mean shelving the construction of the airport and its connecting
railway - the two most important parts of the HKDollars 163.7bn (Pounds
12bn) project. A tender for a HKDollars 9bn contract for the construction of
the airport site expires next month and will have to be renegotiated if
China does not agree the financing.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Hopes fade for cut in US rates: Fed believes recent data do
not point to a fresh slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve seems unlikely to cut interest rates before the
presidential election on November 3 because it regards as inconclusive
recent signs of a slowing of economic growth.
Recent data confirm that economic growth is not accelerating, as previously
predicted, but they do not point conclusively to a fresh slowdown, a senior
Fed official said.
The official said relatively strong figures for car, truck and retail sales
conflicted with other evidence of economic weakness, such as last week's
poor employment data. He said the most likely prospect was for a
continuation of growth in the 1-2 per cent range. But he conceded such
sluggish growth might result in a further increase in unemployment in coming
months.
A cut in US rates was widely expected in financial markets this week
following disappointing economic reports, including falls in industrial
orders, consumer confidence and employment.
The Fed's reluctance to cut rates probably also reflected a desire not to
appear partisan in the approach to the presidential election or to cause
further turbulence in currency markets, where the dollar remains weak.
The official said much of the dollar's weakness reflected temporary interest
rate differentials and was not a source of concern in the longer term.
He was sceptical of the merits of a short-term fiscal boost to 'kick start'
the economy, even if it were linked to longer-term fiscal restraint.
The main factor depressing economic growth was balance sheet strains,
reflecting high debts accumulated in the 1980s to buy assets, such as real
estate, that had since fallen in value. The need to rebuild savings and
reduce debts had diverted purchasing power and meant there was no way of
avoiding a long adjustment period, he said.
He added that the process of repairing balance sheets had been under way for
almost three years but was only about half complete. The economy might be
affected by weakened balance sheets for another three years although the
effects might progressively diminish.
Reductions in long-term bond yields would do far more to stimulate the
economy than further cuts in short-term rates, which were already down to 3
per cent. Long-term rates were high mainly because markets were worried by
the US's large structural budget deficit and by the risk that inflation
would begin rising again in a few years.
The official said long-term rates could fall as much as 1.5 percentage
points, to about 6 per cent, if agreement could be reached on a credible
fiscal package involving statutory reductions in 'entitlement' programmes
such as federal health care and pensions.
The official defended the Fed's 'gradualist' policy of lowering interest
rates. He said the Fed could not have moved any faster for fear of raising
inflationary fears and putting upward pressure on long-term bond yields.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Gorbachev criticises Yeltsin over raid on his institute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, the former Soviet president, yesterday accused his
successor, Mr Boris Yeltsin, of 'authoritarian tendencies' after an early
morning raid on his institute which his aides described as 'the second
October revolution'.
'This is an act of political revenge,' Mr Gorbachev told journalists, after
he and a few assistants managed to force their way into the graceful,
parquet-floored building from which his Gorbachev Foundation is being
ousted.
He said the move exemplified 'the increasingly authoritarian tendencies of
today's leaders'.
The eviction, ordered by decree by the Russian president on Wednesday night,
followed Mr Gorbachev's declaration in a Russian newspaper interview that Mr
Yeltsin was 'clearly not coping with his duties'. Mr Gorbachev learned his
foundation was to be displaced by a new academy for financiers when he
turned on his television on Wednesday night.
Then early yesterday morning, Mr Arkady Murashov, the Moscow chief of
police, with three busloads of municipal police and, according to the
newspaper Izvestia, the OMON anti-riot forces, blocked all entrances to Mr
Gorbachev's premises. The police sealed off the accounts and store-rooms of
the building, leading Mr Gorbachev to joke that they might be seeking the
gold and dollar reserves allegedly stolen by the now disbanded Communist
party.
Mr Alexander Poklad, a Yeltsin spokesman, said that Mr Yeltsin was 'above
petty recriminations' and would not respond to Mr Gorbachev's charges. He
claimed that the only objective of the presidential decree was to secure
more space for the vital task of training financial specialists.
However, Mr Yeltsin's tough action highlights his tendency to hold personal
grudges and resolve troublesome issues by presidential fiat.
Mr Gorbachev, who is barred from leaving the country because of his refusal
to answer a second summons by the constitutional court in its inquest into
the Communist party, was deprived of his black limousine when he attacked Mr
Yeltsin's economic performance earlier this year.
The former leader, who in the past was equally capable of dealing
humiliating blows to his protege who became his rival, has gained some
public sympathy as a result of the high-handedness of Mr Yeltsin's actions
and the hardships caused by his economic reforms.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Beijing's reaction to Mr Patten's proposals for greater democracy is merely
one of several uncertainties overshadowing Hong Kong at the moment. The
bitter dispute over US access to Chinese markets, foot-dragging over Hong
Kong's new airport, and the outcome of the US presidential election are
issues of at least equal importance to stock market investors.
For this reason the next few weeks may well provide a rollercoaster ride
even by the colony's normally exciting standards. The immediate fall-out
from Mr Patten was restricted to a 33 point fall in the Hang Seng - but much
depends on what sort of a rocket he receives when he visits the mainland
later this month. The trade issue comes to a head this weekend. While the
betting must be on a peaceful settlement, shares will be marked sharply
lower if US sanctions are imposed. The reality, if it comes, of a
protectionist President Clinton would be another jolt to local sentiment.
The question is how far investors will set aside short-term concerns and
concentrate on China's long term potential as the engine of Hong Kong's
continued growth. There remains the virtuous combination for equities of
high inflation and cheap money, though as Europeans know such a mixture
cannot last forever. The danger signs will flash when US interest rates
begin to rise. But on the assumption that this is yet some way off, there
could be another leg to the bull market around the turn of the year.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Littlechild, the electricity watchdog, is struggling with some
knotty issues. His paper on future supply regulation invites submissions on
alternatives to the price control RPI-X formula. But in the same breath it
appears to dismiss the main possibilities, such as rate of return
regulation. Perhaps this is not surprising. Mr Littlechild has been closely
identified with the development of the RPI-X regime and might be expected to
defend it.
Price control does indeed provide efficiency incentives which other systems
lack. Yet a rate of return is implicit in assumptions made about any price
cap and the reasonable efficiency gains a company can make. Thus the price
control ought to be pitched at a level to make the implied rate of return
comparable to that of similar businesses. Rate of return cannot simply be
ignored.
The RPI-X system functions well enough for the business of transmitting
power down the wires: a natural monopoly from which the regional electricity
companies earn almost 95 per cent of their profits. Supply - the buying and
selling of electricity - is not naturally a monopoly. With more competition,
price regulation could be abandoned for all but domestic customers.
Unfortunately supply is a low margin business, so to lure new entrants Mr
Littlechild may be tempted to sweeten supply returns at the expense of
distribution. British Gas must be watching keenly. The issues of acceptable
rate of return and the balance of distribution and supply are at the heart
of its Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Equity indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On an optimistic reading of the economic cycle, this is an auspicious moment
to launch an index of medium-sized companies. Having been roundly
out-performed by the bigger FT-SE 100 stocks over the past three years,
companies in the new Mid 250 index should recover the lost ground during an
upswing. For one thing, the new index is weighted in favour of sectors such
as engineering and construction which are geared to domestic recovery.
Midcap stocks are also, on average, more heavily borrowed and stand to
benefit particularly from lower short-term interest rates.
Indeed, on most conventional valuations Mid 250 stocks look cheap: the index
is trading on a multiple of around 13 times last years earnings, against 15
times for the market as a whole. The US experience, though, suggests
medium-sized stocks are vulnerable to disenchantment even in the early
stages of recovery. The Standard &amp; Poor's Midcap index outpaced the S&amp;P 500
during 1991 in anticipation of the turn, but has fallen behind this year.
With this in mind, UK institutions may be wary of buying an index which
contains a fair few troubled former FT-SE 100 stocks until there are clear
signs of a domestic upturn.
There is also a penalty in terms of higher trading costs. The average
dealing spread for Mid 250 stocks is some 75 per cent higher than for FT-SE
100 shares. That said, there must be a fair chance that higher trading
volume in mid-sized stocks will encourage tighter spreads.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Soft targets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Remember the promise to balance the budget over the cycle? Or the vehement
assertion of no devaluation? Well, now the chancellor has presented us with
a formal inflation target. As of August, the UK did not meet it. Today's
figures for September may conceivably fall within the range, but only just,
despite the severity of the recession. The rest of yesterday's statement
contained little new to fill the policy vacuum. The government has left
itself free to look at everything and pay attention to nothing in deciding
policy, though, as the markets had already come to suspect, there is clearly
no chance now of a dash for growth.
That is not encouraging for equities, though it should be positive both for
sterling and for the long end of the gilt market which duly responded by
rallying a point. While the chancellor's fumbling presentation leaves a
great deal unanswered about the longer term policy mix, the inflation threat
from devaluation will remain muted while economic activity remains so
depressed. Any immediate blip in prices can be excused, as the Treasury
statement implies, on the grounds of changing terms of trade. There is time
to sort out the budget, especially from behind the shelter of relatively
high interest rates.
The real credibility test for the inflation target will come only after
recovery has begun. The government would need a better articulated and more
predictable policy. Then again, there is perhaps no hurry. Devaluation may
have made UK exports more competitive, but overseas markets are weak. Mr
Lamont has not done much yet to secure growth.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas in novel
health deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the financially stretched US aerospace group, yesterday
came up with an innovative means of protecting its balance sheet from the
impact of new accounting rules for retirees' health benefits.
The plan, which covers retirees who do not belong to a union, involves the
replacement of company-funded health care coverage with a scheme funded by
the retirees themselves - though much of the cost will be met by a special
trust fund set up by the company.
The financial key to the scheme, which will last until at least 1996, is the
establishment of a special trust which will draw on a surplus in the
company's pension fund, estimated at Dollars 2.2bn in December 1991.
McDonnell said that the surplus would be reduced by about Dollars 300m.
All US companies face large non-cash write-offs over the next year as they
adopt Standard Financial Accounting Statement 106, which requires them to
show their future healthcare obligations to retirees, rather than what they
are actually paying out in any given year.
McDonnell said yesterday that its scheme would reduce its estimated FASB 106
write off from Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.8bn - almost half shareholders'
equity - to about Dollars 600m to Dollars 700m. It explained that retirees
enrolling in its new plan would receive a one-time supplement - drawn from
the special pension benefit trust - which could be used to pay for coverage
identical to that offered under the company scheme.
The company said the amount of the supplement, after taxes, equalled almost
all of the cost of the premium, so 'most retirees will have little, if any,
new costs that are not covered by the supplemental pension benefit'.
The complexities of the scheme may cause anxiety among McDonnell employees,
although the company argued yesterday that its commitment to the plan until
1996 meant greater security for retirees, since up till now it has had the
power to modify its benefits programme.
Termination of the company-funded healthcare plan will allow McDonnell to
cut its cash spending on retiree health care, which it said had more than
quadrupled in the last decade.
The programme affects some 20,000 retirees and will involve a further 50,000
employees when they retire.
McDonnell Douglas's balance sheet has been strained ever since it spent some
Dollars 4bn to develop its new MD-11 wide-bodied civilian aircraft. It lacks
the funds to develop a larger aircraft, the MD-12 and has been seeking Asian
equity finance, so far without success.

THE PRICE war in the personal computer market has claimed 1,000 victims at
Compaq Computer, which yesterday announced it would axeabout 10 per cent of
its work force worldwide .
Compaq also said it would take about Dollars 85m in restructuring and other
special charges in the third quarter to cover severance costs, writedowns
and a loss on the early retirement of long-term debt.
The charges will be offset by a gain of around Dollars 86m on the sale of
stock Compaq held in Conner Peripherals, a manufacturer of computer disk
drives and a Compaq supplier.
The redundancies come despite record revenues and unit shipments in the
third quarter just ended, Compaq said.
The company said operating earnings for the third quarter were 'comfortably
above second-quarter 1992 levels', when Compaq earned Dollars 29m, or 35
cents per share. Compaq lost Dollars 70m, or 82 cents, in the third quarter
of 1991.
After the loss a year ago, Compaq's board ousted Mr Rod Canion, co-founder,
and promoted Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer to president and chief executive. Compaq
also sacked 1,400 workers. The latest cuts are being made 'in anticipation
of a continuing intensely-competitive market environment', Mr Pfeiffer said.
PC prices, which have dropped about 30 per cent in the US this year, are
continuing to fall and the momentum of the price war is picking up in Europe
and other markets.
Compaq's share price rose sharply to Dollars 36 1/4 at midday yesterday, up
from Wednesday's close of Dollars 33 1/2 .
James Buxton, Scottish Correspondent, adds: In Europe, Compaq will close its
plant at Stirling in Scotland and concentrate all European manufacturing
operations at its main plant at Erskine, near Glasgow.
Up to 100 employees who work in management, professional, engineering and
administrative functions will lose their jobs, reducing the Scottish
manufacturing payroll to just over 800.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hard man at the head of South
Korea's steel revolution bows out - John Burton examines the political
manoeuvres in the run-up to presidential elections that prompted the
chairman of Posco to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT has been a momentous week for South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Company
(Posco), the world's third-largest steelmaker.
Mr Park Tae-joon, founder chairman, last Friday celebrated the completion of
the company's production facilities and the 25th anniversary of Posco's
creation by the Korean government.
But Mr Park this week stunned the company when he suddenly announced his
resignation, as Posco was preparing to offer shares next week to foreigners
for the first time.
Whoever is selected from among the company's top management to succeed Mr
Park will have a hard time matching his reputation as one of South Korea's
best corporate leaders.
When Mr Park, a retired general with limited industrial experience, was
asked by Korea's former military government in 1967 to create a steel
industry that would support the country's rapid push to industrialise,
international advisers said the project was doomed to failure.
Korea lacked the technology, capital and even the iron ore deposits to
support the costly setting up of a steel company.
Nevertheless, Posco today ranks third in world steel production at 21m
tonnes, behind Nippon Steel of Japan and Usinor-Sacilor of France.
Its facilities at Pohang and Kwangyang are among the largest and most
productive steel mills in the world. The efficiency of the plants has meant
that Posco has enjoyed a consistent record of profitability in spite of
pricing its steel below world rates.
Posco is South Korea's fifth-largest company in terms of sales, at
Won5,820bn (Dollars 7.4bn) in 1991, and ranked third in profits at
Won145.6bn. It is also the second-largest capitalised company on the Seoul
exchange.
But the departure of Mr Park, who resigned due to a power struggle with
other leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), has cast a
shadow over the company's otherwise bright future.
The immediate concern is that Posco will suffer a leadership vacuum after Mr
Park's resignation, which dealt a blow to company morale.
The demonstrations staged by both Posco managers and workers to protest Mr
Park's resignation reflected the revered status he enjoyed within the
company. He had built up a corporate personality cult that reflects the
strongly paternalistic role that Korean corporate leaders normally play in
Asia's most Confucian society.
Although Posco's management is considered among the best in South Korea,
there are worries the company may no longer enjoy the beneficial ties forged
by Mr Park with the government, which has a 35 per cent shareholding in
Posco.
Posco will closely monitor the reaction of international investors to this
week's developments as up to 8 per cent of its shares are offered to
foreigners.
One Korean securities analyst said foreign investors were already cautious
about Posco's prospects since it is considered a 'smokestack' company.
The management turmoil has coincided with a slowdown in the South Korean
economy. Posco's biggest domestic consumers - the car, construction and
electronics industries - report only modest growth.
Lucky Securities estimates that Posco sales will increase by only 6 per cent
this year, against a 21.3 per cent rise in 1991. Net earnings are forecast
to grow by 3 per cent against a 84.3 per cent jump in profits a year ago.
The earnings performance has also been harmed by financial costs associated
with the completion of the Kwangyang facilities, as well as increased
competition in export markets.
Although Posco's debt/equity ratio of 127 per cent is high by international
standards, it is modest for a Korean company. The Ministry of Finance's 20
per cent shareholding in Posco has meant that the company has received
preferential treatment in being allowed to tap overseas capital markets,
where interest rates are lower. The ministry normally keeps a tight control
on Korean corporate borrowing abroad.
Posco believes domestic demand will rebound strongly next year due to
expected higher car sales and the construction start of new infrastructure
projects, including a high-speed railway and a new airport for Seoul.
Posco sells 70 per cent of its steel output in the domestic market. The
company, which accounts for 70 per cent of Korean steel production, is still
unable to satisfy the growing domestic appetite for steel despite the
completion of new production facilities. South Korean steel demand exceeds
domestic supply by around 5m tonnes.
Indeed, the percentage of Posco's total production going for export, mainly
to Japan and south-east Asia, has fallen over the past decade.
Meanwhile, Posco is attempting to increase profit margins by producing
higher quality speciality steel, although 95 per cent of its production
remains basic steel.
Predictions that Korean steel consumption will peak by the year 2000 has
forced Posco to begin diversifying its activities. It wants 30 per cent of
its sales to come from non-steel operations within the next 10 years.
It established a research institute in 1977 and opened a private technical
university a decade later to develop expertise in semiconductors, speciality
chemicals, genetic engineering, ceramics and factory automation, all of
which are considered potential areas for expansion.
But its diversification strategy suffered a setback in August when it failed
to win the licence to operate the country's first private mobile telephone
network.
Posco made a bid for the licence through its three-year-old information and
telecommunications subsidiary, Posdata, in co-operation with Pacific Telesis
of the US and Mannesmann of Germany.
The contract was awarded, instead, to the Sunkyong group, Korea's
seventh-largest conglomerate, although it was later withdrawn after the
political opposition charged that nepotism was involved in the selection.
The Sunkyong chairman is an in-law of President Roh Tae-woo.
Although a new competition for the licence is scheduled for next year,
Posco's chances of winning the contract appear to have been harmed by the
departure of Mr Park and his feud with Mr Kim Young-sam, the DLP president
and the next likely president of Korea.
But Mr Park may still have his revenge. There is talk that he may break his
ties with the DLP, of which he is a co-chairman, and stand as an independent
in the presidential election in December.
If that happens, there is a good chance that he could win, since he now
heads the majority faction of the DLP and could attract many of its
supporters away from Mr Kim.
In spite of this week's upheaval, Posco may be about to see that its best
days lie ahead under a possible Park presidency.
THE Posco directors yesterday approved the resignation of Mr Park Tae-joon
as chairman.
Mr Park rejected an offer to become honorary chairman.
The change is linked to a dispute between Mr Park, also co-chairman of the
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), and other party leaders about the
forthcoming presidential election.
Mr Park has refused to support the party's candidate, Mr Kim Young-sam. Mr
Kim, DLP president, has threatened to expel Mr Park from the party.

IMPROVED advertising and circulation at The Wall Street Journal have helped
Dow Jones, the newspaper's owner, to achieve a 31.7 per cent rise in
third-quarter net profits.
Dow Jones said it also benefited from lower interest expenses and higher
earnings at Ottaway Newspapers, a regional newspaper division.
It reported Dollars 21.09m third-quarter net profits, against Dollars 16m a
year ago. Earnings per share were 21 cents, up from 16 cents last time.
Group operating income was 22.7 per cent higher at Dollars 54m.
Third-quarter revenues were Dollars 438.1m, up from Dollars 409.5m last
year.
Revenues for the first nine months of 1992 were Dollars 1.34bn, against
Dollars 1.27bn while net income was Dollars 92.94m, a 35.3 per cent
improvement year-on-year. Earnings per share advanced to 92 cents, compared
with 68 cents in the first nine months of 1991.
Dow Jones said its business publications division achieved more than doubled
operating income of Dollars 13.7m in the third quarter of 1992. Revenues in
the division were 6.6 per cent higher at Dollars 175.7m.
Advertising lineage at The Wall Street Journal rose by 6.4 per cent in the
third quarter and by 7.3 per cent in the first nine months.
The information services business, which includes Dow Jones/Telerate and
Business Information Services, reported 'a slight increase' in third-quarter
operating income, to Dollars 36.64m. Revenues were 8.3 per cent better at
Dollars 203.54m.
Operating income at Ottaway Newspapers was 24 per cent higher at Dollars
7.87m, although advertising linage at Ottaway's 22 daily newspapers declined
by 3.2 per cent in the third quarter.
On Wall Street, where shares in Dow Jones traded lightly, the price was
marked Dollars 1/2 lower to Dollars 27 3/8.

THE FEDERAL National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported
third-quarter net income of Dollars 412.9m, the 19th consecutive
record-breaking quarter for the company, the largest mortgage provider in
the US.
Fannie Mae's latest result beat the record of Dollars 402m in the second
quarter, and easily outdistanced the Dollars 350.7m earned at the same stage
of 1991.
Mr James Johnson, chairman, said the performance was fuelled by strong
growth in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issuance, which totalled Dollars
41.3bn, and record fees from sales of Remics (real estate mortgage
investment conduits), which helped offset a decline in net interest income
from Dollars 518.2m to Dollars 506.9m.
Fannie Mae's net interest margin fell in the quarter from 139 basis points
to 133 basis points.
Provisions for losses were Dollars 80m in the quarter, the same as the
previous period, taking total provisions to Dollars 765.8m.
In response, its shares rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in New York.
The Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) yesterday reported a 15
per cent improvement in third-quarter profits to Dollars 100m, or Dollars
1.08 a share. The strong profits performance sent Sallie Mae shares Dollars
1 1/2 higher to Dollars 70 1/2 .

first-half reverse

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIDO Steel, a leading Japanese supplier of steel to the car industry,
expects to report a 56 per cent fall to Y2.5bn (Dollars 20.83m) in pre-tax
profit for the first half, following the rapid decline in domestic passenger
car sales.
The company, strong in specialty steels, forecast sales of Y130bn for the
six months to the end of September, down from Y150.7bn in the same period
last year, due partly to pressure from leading customers for discounts.
The Japanese steel industry has just applied to the government for
assistance in 'employment adjustment', the transfer and retraining of idle
workers.
Steelmakers generally blame the weak demand on falling orders from important
customers such as the construction and car industries. Daido is particularly
vulnerable because about 60 per cent of its orders are from carmakers.
For the full year, Daido expects a pre-tax profit of Y5bn, down from Y10.2bn
last year, on sales of Y260bn, compared to Y299bn. The company had
previously forecast a pre-tax profit of Y7bn and sales of Y280bn.

THE perils of discount broking were brought painfully home to US investors
last month when the share price of Charles Schwab, the country's biggest
discount broker, plunged more than 20 per cent.
The plunge followed a warning that the company's third-quarter profits would
be much lower than expected because of a sharp drop in customer trading
activity.
Although the warning surprised investors, it should not have come as a shock
to anyone who understands discount broking - a business more closely tied to
market cycles than almost any other.
In the past decade, the San Francisco-based Schwab has become the biggest
discount broker in the US by allowing individual investors to buy and sell
shares cheaply and quickly, and by providing them with information and
research they can use to make investment decisions. Unlike other
'full-service' brokers, such as Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman, Schwab
does not advise its customers where to invest.
When the market is booming, and investors are trading in and out of stocks
constantly, discount broking is a very profitable business. But, when the
market slumps, as it has done recently, the revenues of a firm relying on
trading volume to generate the bulk of its income tumble.
This is what happened to Schwab in the third quarter, when daily
transactions by its customers averaged 18,000, well below the peak of 27,000
recorded in the first quarter and the 22,000 in the second quarter. Although
18,000 trades a day is still a good year for Schwab, the company's expenses
over the past year have risen 15 per cent because of heavy spending on
advertising, branch expansion and the introduction of new products and
services.
To make matters worse, Schwab's profits in the third quarter were also hit
by the recent introduction of low-margin products, such as no-fee individual
retirement accounts, which were designed to boost the firm's share of the
discount broking market.
The end result is that Schwab is expected to make a profit in the third
quarter of between 15 cents and 18 cents a share, against the 34 cents a
share it earned a year ago.
When market cycles move against full-service brokers, they can turn to
fee-based revenues from corporate finance and asset management to make up
the shortfall.
Schwab, however, does little trading for its own account, and its asset
management business is still small, albeit growing. At the moment,
commission fees account for a remarkable 80 per cent of its non-interest
revenues.
Schwab has learned to live with the market swings, says Mr David Pottruck,
the company's president: 'We will always have volatile revenues because we
work in a volatile business.' It is a point forcefully echoed by Mr John
Keefe, an independent securities industry analyst in New York: 'They're a
brokerage firm, and its tough to get away from that.'
Instead of worrying about customer activity, Schwab concentrates on
increasing the amount of dollars in its custody. 'Our growth is a function
of how many customers we have . . . The more money that's here, the more
money that trades,' says Mr Pottruck.
In the past few years, the amount of money at Schwab has grown dramatically.
As of June, Dollars 54.3bn was held in 1.8m customer accounts - thanks
primarily to heavy advertising and some astute marketing. The firm recently
opened an office in San Francisco staffed by Chinese-speakers to serve the
city's Asian community, and one in Miami with Spanish-speakers to build
business among the Hispanic community.
Schwab also relies heavily on technology to reduce the costs of handling its
dollars. Mr Pottruck says: 'Years ago, all of our trading was done by people
sitting in branches. Today, 50 per cent of our phone calls go to
TeleBroker,' a service that allows customers to buy and sell stocks on their
touch-tone telephone.
Although Schwab is building up its asset management business to protect
itself against market-related earnings volatility, the company is treading
cautiously. 'We're not looking to become money managers,' says Mr Pottruck.
What Schwab is doing, however, is linking up with the money managers through
its Financial Advisors Service. Launched in 1987, FAS provides investors
with lists of independent investment advisers who work solely for fee. In
return, the advisers route transactions and account servicing to Schwab,
which earns commissions on the business. Today, almost 3,000 advisers and
money managers use the programme, and assets held by Schwab for its 100,000
FAS clients total more than Dollars 10bn.
Although it is dwarfed in size by the full-service giants, Schwab is easily
the biggest discount broker, with a 46 per cent share of the market. It is a
market that is expanding. In 1985, discounters earned 6 per cent of all
broking commissions in the US, but today they earn 11 per cent.
The full-service brokers claim not to be overly concerned about this loss of
business. Some even argue that discount brokers are sowing the seeds of
their own decline by remaining reliant on revenues tied to investor
activity.
One leading executive at a full-service securities house says: 'Schwab are
in a commodity business that has no value-added component to it and that is
very cyclical in terms of order-flows. Schwab are getting themselves into a
problem position.
'They're neither fish nor fowl - there are lots of discounters around where
you can do trade for a lot cheaper than they can, so they don't offer the
lowest price and they don't offer the most service. It creates a
what-do-you-want-to-be-when-you-grow-up syndrome?'
While it is true that other discount brokers, such as Fidelity, Olde, and
Quick &amp; Reilly, charge lower transaction fees, Schwab has built up a good
reputation among individual investors for high quality execution and account
service.
It believes strongly that demographic trends are going its way.
Mr Pottruck maintains that the baby-boom generation, which each year takes
up a larger proportion of the investing population, is becoming increasingly
wary of the traditional client-broker relationship, and of the potential
conflicts between the retail broking and institutional interests within the
big full-service firms.

HONDA Motor, the Japanese car and motorcycle maker, is raising its stake in
Kinetic Honda Motor, its Indian moped joint venture, from 28.56 per cent to
50.92 per cent, to broaden its base there and enter neighbouring export
markets.
Other foreign companies which are increasing stakes in their Indian joint
ventures following the government's recent economic liberalisation programme
are: Gillette, the US shaving products company; Pepsi, the snack-food and
soft-drink maker; Cadbury's, the UK confectioner; and Motorola, the US
micro-chip company.
All are raising their stakes to the newly-permitted maximum of 51 per cent
to increase managerial control. The Indian government hopes this could lead
to big increases in investment and the transfer of technology.
Mr Arun Firodia, Kinetic Honda's managing director, said the venture would
issue 4.5m shares at Rs10 each at a premium of Rs20, to facilitate the
Japanese company's move.
Honda's decision to increase its stake boosted Kinetic's flagging share
price to Rs115 from Rs85 in the last week.
Kinetic Honda, with sales rising 14 per cent to Rs2.76bn in its latest
financial year, has weathered the worst recession to hit India's Rs20bn
motorcycle and scooter industry.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Indian Petrochemicals planning
to go public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN Petrochemicals Corp (IPCL) said yesterday it is to go public on
November 16, making India's largest petrochemicals company the first
government-owned enterprise to invite equity participation from the public.
As part of the government's phased privatisation programme, it had already
divested 20 per cent of the Rs26bn (Dollars 918.7m) company, which will be
listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange later this month.
The company will offer 20m shares of Rs10 each, at a premium of Rs150 a
share to raise Rs3.2bn. The sum will fund its third petrochemicals complex
at Gandhar. This will reduce the government's stake to 72 per cent, and to
51 per cent after a further public offering next year.
The company has projected gross profits of Rs3.9bn on turnover of Rs22.12bn
for the current year, against Rs2.24bn on Rs19.35bn the year before.

FT  09 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firm on chancellor's speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market gave a relatively favourable response to the keenly
awaited exposition of the government's economic strategy from Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. While his speech to the
Conservative party conference damped down expectations of an immediate base
rate cut which had spurred shares ahead early in the session, the stock
market had decided by the close that lower rates are still in prospect
before the year-end.
The FT-SE Index bounced convincingly above the 2,530 hurdle, touching
2,547.3 ahead of first reports of the chancellor's speech. Suggestions of an
immediate cut in UK base rates were sparked off by the announcement that the
Treasury planned a statement, but the driving force behind equities was the
sharp recovery in the pound against the DM, which was encouraged by the
Bundesbank's apparent softening of emphasis on some money supply targets.
Hopes of a cut in German interest rates strengthened in London.
As first reports of the chancellor's speech reached the City of London,
sterling came off quite sharply and equities also reacted to the absence of
any immediate developments on interest rates.
The gain on the Footsie was trimmed from 30.2 to 17.1 but selling was
moderate and traders recovered their confidence as they watched Mr Lamont's
speech on their television screens.
By the close, the market had climbed to a final reading on the Footsie of
2,538.8, for a gain of 21.7 on the day. The Footsie has now recovered all
but 11 points of Monday's dramatic 103 point loss, and equity chart
strategists believe it could be set for an advance to the 2,790 area,
especially if interest rates are reduced in the UK and in Germany.
Seaq volume of 517.6m shares yesterday compared with Wednesday's 545m, worth
Pounds 1.1bn in retail business, a welcome return to the business levels
seen after Britain's exit from the ERM in mid-September.
Also heartening for the stock market was the continued flow of corporate
activity, some actual and some merely rumoured.
Hints of international bid interest took brewery stocks ahead and a
substantial share placing in the insurance sector again demonstrated the
appetite of the institutions for good quality stocks.
Firmness in the US currency against sterling continued to boost the dollar
earning stocks. US interest was again reported among the pharmaceuticals,
where Glaxo and Wellcome extended recent gains. UK institutions have been
sellers of the big drug stocks over the past month but sector analysts in
the UK now believe that prices will recover strongly on the back of demand
from across the Atlantic.
Gains in the interest-related stocks were fairly modest, however, and
investors appeared to be slightly disappointed by the absence from Mr
Lamont's speech of a target range for sterling. The progress of the pound on
currency markets is still the key factor in the timing of further reductions
in UK interest rates.

FT  09 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Refuge stake placed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLACING power of Cazenove, the UK broker which has been notably
successful in holding on its post-Big Bang influence in the UK equity
market, was in evidence again yesterday as it bought a 10 per cent stake in
Refuge Insurance and successfully placed the shares with institutional
clients.
Cazenove bought the 5.16m shares from Canadian Refuge Holdings for 645p a
share and sold them on at 650p a share. The deal is the second big bought
deal involving Cazenove in two days. On Wednesday, in a joint effort with
Warburg Securities, it bought and sold a 9 per cent stake in Anglian Water
from Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French group, a deal that netted the two
broking firms more than Pounds 1.32m. Yesterday's deal was thought to have
delivered a profit of more than Pounds 250,000 for Cazenove.
Refuge Canada Holdings, a separate Canadian life assurance group, held the
stake in Refuge Holdings for many years. Refuge shares held rock steady
throughout the session, closing at 680p. Other life shares suffered from
selling by institutions keen to take advantage of the big discount available
in the Refuge placing. Legal &amp; General slipped 7 to 333p, Lloyds Abbey 7 to
331p and London &amp; Manchester 8 to 234p.
Reuters wanted
A profits upgrading, hints of a forthcoming share split and expectations
that an upcoming visit by leading UK analysts to the group's US operations
may bring further re-ratings, triggered a strong rise in Reuters shares. The
stock ended a busy session a net 22 higher at 1,264p on relatively good
volume of 588,000 shares.
Goldman Sachs, the US brokerage, upgraded its profits forecasts for the
group to reflect the weakness of sterling, pencilling in earnings per share
of 69.7p for 1992, up from 66.6p, and 78.6p for 1993, up from 76.2p, to
allow for earnings growth of 11 per cent, against a previous estimate of 10
per cent. Goldman labelled Reuters 'our number one stock idea'.
Next week Reuters is taking a group of 10 leading UK analysts on a visit to
Chicago, to view the Chicago Board of Trade market and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange to observe Reuters' Globex automated trading systems,
and then on to New York to see its Dealing 2000 system in operation. A
presentation to UK and US analysts is also planned for later this month.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the packaging and paper group which fell from grace
after a totally unexpected cut in the interim dividend last month, suffered
another setback as one broker clipped its profits estimate. The shares
closed 7 down at 156p, a fall of 4.3 per cent on the day, making the stock
the weakest performer among Footsie constituents. Turnover was a hefty 4.2m.
Yesterday's decline followed a profits downgrade instigated by County
NatWest. The broker, citing growing recessionary pressures, chopped its 1992
forecast from Pounds 180m to Pounds 170m. County said Arjo shares have
bounced some 30p since the dividend shock three weeks ago and that 'any
further strength in the share price should be seen as an opportunity to
trade out'.
Asda upgrades
Positive hints over trading continued to underpin the rise in Asda shares,
ahead 1 3/4 at 38 1/4 p in hefty turnover of 18m, the heaviest traded stock
of the day. Nomura and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew both upgraded the stores group
yesterday after speaking to the company, raising their estimates to Pounds
95m and Pounds 110m respectively for this year.
While word from the company is that trading has slightly improved, analysts
cautioned that the company was starting from a low base and the shares were
only a good buy on a short-term recovery and yield potential.
Currency considerations gave a boost to selected pharmaceutical stocks.
Glaxo added 13 to 777p and Wellcome 27 to 975p.
In the hotel sector, a large buyer of stock in Queens Moat Houses saw the
final turnover reach 10m. The shares rose 1 1/2 to 35 1/2 p. Forte gained 5
to 159p aided by a renewed buy recommendation from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Grand Metropolitan's return to favour continued, the shares climbing 3 to
391p, helped by US broking house Merrill Lynch raising its intermediate term
rating to above average from neutral. Hints that tobacco giant Philip Morris
might be interested in buying Heineken boosted Whitbread, which has a
licensing agreement with the Dutch brewer. The 'A' shares jumped 17 to 433p.
Switching from Sainsbury, 6 up at 463p, into Tesco was reported from a
number of institutions. Tesco's closed 7 ahead at 223p in heavy turnover of
9.6m, helped also by a reiterated buy recommendation from UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew.
Talk that the chairman and chief executive at conglomerate Trafalgar House
were about to resign did the rounds. The company is under siege from
Hongkong Land, which last week took a 15 per cent stake in Trafalgar and is
shopping for an equivalent stake. The shares edged 1 1/2 forward to 86 1/2
p, just ahead of the 85p offered by Hongkong Land, on turnover of 4m.
Turnover in motor components group T &amp; N rose to 9.4m and the shares gave up
3 to 138p on reports that agency broker James Capel had carried out a
placing of 4.5m shares with a majority of the day's business dealt at the
135p level.
Shares in engineering group Siebe, depressed of late by a stock overhang,
were wanted yesterday and gained 8 to 347p. Kleinwort Benson, the company's
broker, was reported to have shown a keen interest in the shares.
It was a stock overhang early in the session but which later cleared that
caused a retreat in IMI, and the shares ended 7 lower at 228p. Also busy
yesterday were APV and Vickers. The former firmed a penny to 77 1/2 p, while
the latter lost a penny to 90p.
Lonrho fell 5 to 59p, with BZW reported to have downgraded current-year
profit estimates.
The high street banks made more good progress, NatWest adding 11 at 348p on
3.4m traded and Barclays, despite the lingering dividend concerns, a further
5 up at 342p. Standard Chartered put on 5 at 481p with speculative buying
stimulated by hints of a possible bid from the Far East.
The prospect of a post-ERM burst of lucrative mergers and acquisitions was
behind keen demand for the merchant banks. Kleinwort Benson rose 9 to 290p
after an agency cross of 350,000.
Sun Alliance retreated 7 to 286p, after news of the merger of the Australian
non-life operations of Sun and Royal Insurance. Dealers were surprised at
the decline in Sun shares; 'it looks a sensible long-term deal,' said one
specialist.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATIVE buying in anticipation of a cut in UK base rates gave an early
boost to derivates, much of which petered out later in the day, writes Joel
Kibazo.
In Footsie futures, the December contract saw demand mostly from independent
traders at the session's opening and the first bargain was struck at 2,560.
Further demand in anticipation of positive news on UK interest rates drove
December higher and by 10.30am it was trading at the day's high of 2,585.
The lack of an announcement on interest rates led to a sharp retreat in the
contract and it fell to 2,550, the low point of the day.
The early strength of Wall Street proved a stabilising factor and December
slowly clawed its way back to end at 2,580, around 10 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 32. Turnover was reasonable at
9,893 lots.
Volume in the options reached 32,468 lots with the FT-SE 100 option trading
13,760 lots. Amstrad was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,557 lots
dealt. The June 30 calls were the busiest series. This was followed by
Barclays at 1,886 lots, and then by Asda, in which 1,508 trades were
recorded.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark eases against dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING, the dollar and the Italian lira all rallied against the D-Mark
yesterday as dealers continued to believe that the Bundesbank would cut its
official interest rates again this month, writes James Blitz.
Earlier this week, the Bundesbank added liquidity to the German money market
at a fixed rate of 8.9 per cent, 60 basis points below the Lombard rate and
80 basis points below the level at which it was adding funds three weeks
ago.
Two Bundesbank Council members have also commented that the M3 indicator of
monetary supply indicator should lose some of its status as the fulcrum of
monetary policy.
These moves give the impression that the Bundesbank has positioned itself to
cut official rates to meet growing signs that the country is moving into
recession. 'There is a growing perception that this is the big turn in
German economic policy,' said Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation in London.
These moves continued to push the dollar up to a London close of DM1.4730
yesterday, more than 3 pfennigs higher on the day and nearly 6 pfennigs
higher on the week.
Two of the free floating currencies in Europe, the lira and sterling,
continued to gain ground. The lira closed at L888.0 against the D-Mark,
L22.9 higher on the day, and a staggering L92 higher than its low point on
Tuesday.
Sterling also benefitted from the growing perception that a cut in German
rates will weaken the D-Mark and give the UK government more room to
manoeuvre on interest rate cuts. The pound closed at DM2.4900, up nearly 2
pfennigs on the day. By contrast, Mr Norman Lamont's speech to the
Conservative Party conference, which was billed as outlining the
government's new economic policy, did little to support the currency. The
pound actually lost 2 pfennigs as an accompanying policy document was
issued, bottoming out at DM2.4650. 'The speech and the Treasury document
were a disappointment because there was nothing new,' said Mr Austin. 'It
was a re-hash of the 1980s policy of throwing all the indicators into a
basket and looking at them that way.'
However, another analyst suggested that the increased emphasis on monetary
indicators could be a precursor to a rate cut and that he would not be
surprised by a 1 percentage point cut today, the final day of the
conference.
Currencies inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism did not rally because there
were continuing fears of a realignment to support the weaker members. The
French franc closed higher at FFr3.3920 to the D-Mark, while the peseta
weakened to close at Pta71.45 against the German currency.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Watching Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES in the sterling cash market softened again yesterday as dealers
continued to believe that the Bundesbank was positioning itself to cut its
official interest rates.
The German central bank's decision in recent days to reduce the rate at
which it deals in the German money markets to 8.9 per cent has fuelled
speculation that it could cut its official Lombard rate by about 50 basis
points without causing a reversal in the D-Mark's fortunes.
By contrast, Mr Norman Lamont's speech at the Conservative Party conference
left dealers uncertain about the government's immediate policy on UK base
rates. The chancellor said that he had 'not set a target range for the
exchange rate.' However, he added that he did not propose to set a policy of
of setting interest rates in relation to domestic criteria 'and then letting
the exchange rate go where it will.'
As one discount house trader said: 'The policy vacuum remains. We are no
clearer about the UK's policy now than we were two weeks ago.' However,
another suggested that the Bundesbank might end up 'saving Mr Lamont's
bacon.'
The December short sterling contract opened yesterday at 91.88, a level
which assumes that there will be something close to a full percentage point
cut in rates before the end of the year. As Mr Lamont's statements came out
yesterday, the contract dipped to a low of 91.75, tracking a 2 pfennig fall
in the currency.
However, the contract later bounced back with sterling, to close at 91.93,
12 basis points up on the day.
Cash rates were a little less volatile. The three-month offered rate for
cash - seen as a good guide to the future direction of interest rates -
closed at 8 7/8 per cent,  1/16 per cent down on the day. One month money
eased for the second day running, closing at 9 1/16 per cent offered, from 9
3/16 per cent.
Dealers were slow to offer bills to the Bank of England yesterday until Mr
Lamont's speech was over. A shortage of Pounds 800m was forecast and later
revised up to Pounds 950m.
The Bank purchased Pounds 20m in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent,
Pounds 138m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 170m of Band
1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. There was late assistance of Pounds 455m.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (12): Financial image gets a shine - Moves
to liberalise the securities market are 'too little, too late'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S government has long been criticised for moving too slowly to
improve the image of the island's financial markets.
But last month the government cracked down on illegal margin lending,
licensed 11 new foreign mutual funds, and speeded up approvals for inward
remittances by foreign fund managers for investment in equities, although
these remittances are still subject to clearance by the island's central
bank.
The sudden surge of activity constituted an attempt to whip up confidence in
Taiwan's sagging stock market, after the discovery of stock defaults worth
more than USDollars 320m, and the detention of two of the market's 'big
hands', or stock speculators, last month. The market fell more than 10 per
cent at one stage, although it has since recovered slightly.
Foreign fund managers say, however, that the government's moves were too
little, too late and the conservative central bank remains a barrier to
securities market liberalisation.
Mr David Yu, research manager at Wardley James Capel, said: '(The recent
measures) are better than nothing. But inward remittances should be approved
by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) alone. It's unreasonable that
the central bank has so much control.'
Under the present system, inward-bound funds already approved by Taiwan's
SEC can still be delayed for months, or even finally refused, if the central
bank thinks they might contribute to Taiwan dollar appreciation.
The finance ministry had originally hoped to attract USDollars 2.5bn to
Taiwan in foreign institutional investment, to broaden the investor base.
Since an application by Hong Kong's Jardine Fleming was first approved in
March 1991, however, only USDollars 735m has been remitted to Taiwan, by 14
fund managers. These include Fidelity Investments of the US, and Pierson,
Hendring and Pierson of the Netherlands.
The problems in the stock market sum up for foreign investors the problems
that Taiwan faces in its ambitions to become a regional financial centre.
There have been cautious moves towards reform. But financial markets remain
poorly structured, for example 70 per cent of investment comes from
individuals, rather than institutions, and the government retains
significant control over markets which it deems strategic, such as foreign
exchange.
One area which has been reformed, however, is domestic commercial banking,
where 15 new local banks began operations at the beginning of this year,
ending 40 years of a near-monopoly by state-run banks, and almost doubling
the number of domestic banks within four months.
The newcomers have initiated feverish competition within the banking
industry, particularly in short-term lending, mortgages and demand deposits,
which now make up around 60 per cent of all their deposits.
The new banks, which have a minimum paid-in capital of USDollars 400m, have
been permitted to increase their number of branches at a faster rate than
the established banks. However, they are not likely to be licensed to handle
the simplest foreign exchange transactions for at least another year.
The suddenness with which the banking sector was opened up has generated
fears among industry observers that there will not be enough business to go
round. Many predict failures, or at best mergers, within the next few years.
The government has said bank failures are not its responsibility, but the
shareholders', among whom are some of Taiwan's largest companies.
Vice-finance minister Mr Lee Chung-ying said: 'In a free-market system, you
can't prevent banks from going under,' but added that his ministry
periodically runs checks on the newcomers' books.
In an attempt to improve financial facilities for Taiwanese investors in
mainland China, the government last month also allowed Taiwan banks to do
business with branches of Chinese banks overseas, and Chinese branches of
foreign banks, although direct financial links with China are still banned.
The sudden expansion of commercial banking has led to complaints from
foreign banks, whose margins are being pared away by the new competition.
Foreign banks have only recently been permitted to apply for a second branch
in Taiwan, and are not allowed to open subsidiaries. Foreign bankers say
they would also like to see faster progress in foreign exchange markets.
The government has been moving slowly on drafting regulations for new
financial products. Taiwan still has no domestic futures market, although a
law allowing trading in foreign futures through foreign brokers will come
into effect this November. Implementation may take some time.
Other reforms, which may also be delayed due to differences within the
government on the speed of change, include the completion of a new law
abolishing foreign exchange controls except in a state of emergency, to go
before the legislature within the next year.
The government has begun processing applications for new domestic insurance
companies. Among foreign insurers only American insurance companies, or US
subsidiaries of non-US companies, are at present allowed to set up branches
in Taiwan. However, this situation may change due to pressure on Taiwan to
liberalise its financial services markets in order to enter the Gatt.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (9): Transports of despair - Luisetta Mudie
sums up the advantages and disadvantages of Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S capital, Taipei, has little to recommend it. It combines the
traffic problems of Tokyo and Bangkok with precious little of Hong Kong's
efficiency; it is the capital of an island, recognised by very few
governments, which is forever being confused with Thailand; it is the third
most expensive city in Asia; it is harder to get a traveller's cheque cashed
in Taipei than in Beijing; just to breathe the air is a health hazard . . .
the list is endless.
However, Taiwan in general and Taipei in particular do have their
advantages. The people are helpful, friendly and well-educated - many speak
English. When the defeated Kuomintang troops fled to Taiwan in 1949, they
brought with them some of the best chefs in China, and that culinary
tradition is still upheld.
The city's young, increasingly well-heeled population creates a stimulating
atmosphere with an abundance of night-life; the streets are safer at night
than in most western cities, and traditional Chinese culture and festivals
are still observed.
One of the first things a visitor to Taipei notices is the traffic. The
explosion in transport occurred mostly over the past five years, when
increasing prosperity began to mean crippling import tariffs were no longer
a curb on demand for flashy cars. Status is emphasised, rather than utility,
so Taipei's narrow back alleys can often be completely blocked by a monster
of a Buick or Mercedes negotiating the gap between parked cars.
A six-year infrastructure development plan is intended to relieve Taipei's
chronic problem, but the city's first Mass Rapid Transit urban railway
system is not due for completion until next summer, and the entire network
will not be in place until 1997. Until then, the ubiquitous yellow Taipei
taxi will continue to be the main form of transport for foreign visitors,
and still subject to the twice-daily rush-hour nightmare.
Dining out in Taipei is never a problem. China's regional cuisine is
well-represented, as well as most western fast food and 'informal dining'
chains. There is a large choice for top-end diners, but don't be surprised
if dishes are taken away before you think you have finished.
Lavish spending has become a way of life in Taiwan, and staff at expensive
restaurants have been trained to give the impression that the customer is
far too wealthy to want to clean off every plate.
Most of the international hotels have a good selection of restaurants, often
with all-you-can-eat deals, or set menus. The Lai Lai Sheraton's Teppan-yaki
is a good example of this. Wine has hitherto been pricey as a result of a
government monopoly on imports, but these were liberalised last month.
For an informal dining experience, Taipei's Indian Beer House is a must. It
serves Taiwan's favourite dishes, that is, seafood and the delicious
'three-cup chicken' with draught Taiwan beer to wash it down. Located on Pa
Teh (Baa-der) Road next to the 24-hour filling station, it is easily
recognisable by a dinosaur skeleton protruding from the roof.
Away from the smog, to the north of Taipei, sits the largest collection of
Chinese art and antiques outside China. Brought to the island by Chiang
Kai-shek's defeated Nationalists in 1949 after being carried the length and
breadth of China by 'coolies', the collection is housed in the National
Palace Museum. It is so large that it takes about 10 years to rotate all the
pieces stored in the vaults under the mountain.
Other worthwhile tourist attractions are the central cross-island highway,
which runs through some stunningly beautiful scenery in the Taroko Gorge
National Park. The eastern coastal town of Hualien is the best staging post
for this trip, but check conditions during the summer typhoon season.
The Yangmingshan National Park, not far from the Museum, offers scenic
hikes, sulphur baths, and speciality free-range chicken restaurants every
100 yards. Kenting, at the southernmost tip of the island, offers good
seafood, sandy beaches and warm seas, which the locals put down to the
proximity of Taiwan's third nuclear power station. Sun Moon Lake, near
Taichung in central Taiwan, is to be avoided: the only amazing thing about
it is that its water is clean.
Despite the economic miracle and the fact that Taiwan is fast approaching
developed nation status, it is still only possible to exchange foreign
currency into Taiwan dollars at hotels, or specially designated branches of
the Bank of Taiwan.
Travellers' cheques can also be a problem if they are in sterling - usually
all but the issuer will refuse to cash them. Exchange receipts should be
kept - tourist visa holders cannot buy US dollars on leaving Taiwan without
them.
The foreigner's answer to the question of Taiwan's identity varies from day
to day, depending on who you talk to. The ruling KMT, which still exerts
control over the electronic media, does its best to make Taiwan sound and
look as Chinese as possible.
But beside the staunch KMT supporters there is a subculture of Taiwan
nationalism, which ranges from older Taiwanese who remember the 'good old
days' under the Japanese, to the younger generation, which feels no cultural
attachment to China.
Betel nut chewing, once confined to peasants and long-distance lorry
drivers, is now becoming popular among white-collar professionals,
intellectuals and teenagers, as an expression of something peculiar to
Taiwan.
Although the three main Chinese traditional festivals: New year, the Dragon
Boat Festival, and the Autumn Moon festival are still observed, and Beijing
opera is on offer in Taipei's Hsimenting district, films by directors such
as Hou Hsiao-hsien (City of Sadness, Dust of Angels) and work by the Cloud
Gate dance company have a uniquely Taiwanese feel, which has in the past
been regarded as subversive by KMT elders.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (11): Poor planning slows progress - The
quality of life has fallen because of an overloaded infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN may be well be on the way to developed nation status in terms of per
capita GNP, but a lack of government attention to the overburdened
infrastructure has meant the quality of life on the island has deteriorated.
Years of rapid economic growth with poor environmental controls and economic
planning have left Taiwan with heavy pollution levels in soil, air and
water, an unreliable power supply and an overloaded road and rail network.
The six-year development plan, which runs until 1996 and has a total budget
of TDollars 8,200bn, is an attempt to bring together more than 770 badly
needed projects. The areas of most urgent need are transport,
communications, utilities and environmental protection, which receive 49 per
cent of the budget.
As part of an attempt to even out economic development across regions,
Taiwan is to be divided into 18 community hubs, each with its own transport
network, shopping centres and industrial zone. Much of the land needed will
be converted from agricultural use.
Among the larger projects are a fourth nuclear power station, urban mass
transit railway systems for Taiwan's main cities, a pumped water power
project and a high-speed railway linking Taipei to the southern city of
Kaohsiung. Taiwan's two international airports and container port facilities
are also to be expanded.
Some of the projects were not due for completion in six years and some
projects have already been delayed due to poor planning. More than 30
projects were delayed in the first year of the plan alone.
The government has held up bond issues related to current projects worth
TDollars 156bn. Delayed funding will be incorporated into future budgets.
The method of financing the various projects has also generated considerable
controversy. The Council for Economic Planning and Development, which
oversees the six-year plan, says that of the TDollars 8,200bn budget,
TDollars 1,900bn will come from already approved government spending and
TDollars 2,700bn will be financed by the public and private sectors. The
remaining TDollars 3,600bn is to be raised from government capital accounts,
including TDollars 1,100bn from the sale of bonds and government property.
Some economists estimate, however, that the government will need to issue
more than TDollars 5,000bn in bonds by the end of the century if the
six-year plan is to be completed in full, and this is almost certain to lead
to further inflation.
Vice-finance minister Mr Lee Chung-ying says that his ministry has agreed in
principle to support the financing of infrastructure projects from a
government deficit. 'But government borrowing's proportion of GDP is
expected to increase from 6 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent,' he adds. 'We
think that is too much.' However, the finance ministry says it is not
considering raising taxes.
Since July 1991 the government has issued TDollars 102.5bn of bonds to
finance current projects. The main opposition party is calling for
large-scale cuts in projects, which it believes are too expensive, as part
of its election platform.
Meanwhile, there have been allegations that some companies with close
government links have been favoured in the bidding process and awarding of
contracts.
Despite these setbacks, the size and scope of the six-year plan has
attracted high-level trade missions from countries with companies interested
in bidding for important contracts. Bilfinger and Berger of Germany and
Matra of France, have each been awarded contracts to build lines for
Taipei's urban mass transit railway (MRTS), worth USDollars 756m and
USDollars 270m respectively.
Siemens of Germany has been awarded the contract to build a new gas-fired
power plant in southern Taiwan. An initial budget of TDollars 7.9bn for
Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant was approved this year, and Ebasco
Engineering of the US has been contracted as consultant for the first phase
of construction.
However, projects for which Taiwan already possesses technology and
experience, are likely to be awarded to Taiwan companies.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Opt-out school funds squeezed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's campaign to persuade schools in England and Wales to opt
out of local-authority control ran into further trouble yesterday with the
release of an Education Department letter warning of a squeeze in capital
funding for opted-out schools.
Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, who published the letter,
said: 'This shows that the long-term future of grant-maintained status will
involve underfunding.'
The letter instructs opted-out (grant-maintained) schools not to submit bids
for capital spending on libraries, sixth-form blocks, sports halls or
performing-arts facilities. 'In the climate of limited funds there are
greater demands to be met,' it says.
It will cause considerable disappointment to grant-maintained schools, many
of which opted out in the expectation that funding for such projects would
be more readily available from the government than from local authorities.
The letter goes on to tell grant-maintained schools, whose capital funding
comes directly from the government, that because of the tight
public-spending round and the growth of the opted-out sector 'the government
is unable to offer schools the guarantee that the (existing funding) formula
will continue or that funds can be rolled over to the next financial year.'
Head teachers told their pay review body yesterday that the introduction of
performance-related pay for teachers would be a 'recipe for discontent'
unless an extra 5 per cent was given to each successful school.
The National Association of Head Teachers said it had 'substantial
reservations' about merit pay, but would defer judgment until it had studied
any scheme piloted in schools.
The teachers' pay review body will outline proposals in January for
extending performance pay.
In an initial paper, it favoured a scheme rewarding academically successful
schools with a cash bonus. However, Mr John Patten, education secretary, has
criticised the idea, calling instead for individual payments for successful
teachers so all have an incentive to improve their performance.
Mr David Hart, NAHT general secretary, said ministers and the review body
should agree to abandon performance pay it if became 'evident that it will
not work'.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Arson fraud bill is Pounds 100m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRES set by fraudsters are costing insurance companies more than Pounds
100m a year - 10 per cent of the total payout last year - according to the
Arson Prevention Bureau.
The APB, an information and lobby group jointly backed by the insurance
industry and the Home Office, said yesterday: 'An increasingly significant
number of fires are attempts by policyholders to obtain money fraudulently.'
The APB published a booklet yesterday that provides insurers with a
step-by-step guide for dealing with suspected fraudulent arson claims.
Arson accounted for about Pounds 500m of the Pounds 1.02bn paid out by
insurance companies in fire claims last year.
Mr Douglas Woodward, of the APB, said: 'For many years we thought fraudulent
arson accounted for about 10 per cent of all arson fires. Information coming
to us now indicates that it now amounts to at least 20 per cent.'
Concern about arson costs led the insurance industry to set up the APB in
February last year to improve its understanding of the issue.
Mr David McIntosh, a solicitor who has worked with the APB, said the
incidence of fraudulent arson was rising as more businesses were hit by
recession.
'The fact is that people are burning their way out of financial
difficulties,' said Mr McIntosh.
Mr Neil Kelly, a loss adjuster who has worked with the APB, said businesses
with a high level of borrowing or those that were dependent on a current
fashion or fad were particularly exposed to fraudulent arson.
Retailers, advertisers, estate agents, travel agents and companies dependent
on one supplier were also proving vulnerable.
Companies that have expanded rapidly or borrowed heavily are also typically
at risk.
Mr McIntosh urged insurers to resist claims where they suspected arson.
However, he said it was sometimes difficult to persuade judges to take the
issue seriously.
'Judges just don't seem to appreciate just how prevalent fraudulent arson
is,' said Mr McIntosh.
Fraudulent arson: insurer's considerations. APB, 140 Aldersgate St, EC1A

FT  09 OCT 92 / Threat to health pay bodies eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOLISHING the pay review bodies which set National Health Service pay is no
longer a government priority, Mr Eric Caines, the NHS personnel director,
has admitted.
Mr Caines, a strong advocate of abolition of the pay review bodies and the
Whitley Council system, told a recent conference of the National Association
of Health Service Personnel: 'I don't think it will happen in my lifetime.'
According to a report in the Health Service Journal, confirmed by the
Department of Health, Mr Caines repeated his belief that Whitley and the pay
review bodies were of 'supreme irrelevance'. But he added: 'There are a lot
of attitudes around the centre which are about consensus.'
Health department evidence to the Nurses, Midwifery and Health Visitors Pay
Review Body said that the review bodies would continue to set national
'benchmarks' despite trusts' freedom to set their own terms and conditions
for new staff. Existing employees who transferred into trusts would retain
their old NHS terms and conditions.
Mr Caines blamed trusts and health authorities for failing to take control
of their pay systems. He warned that an exceptionally tight public spending
round would force managers to look carefully at how many staff they employed
and how they were paid.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Regulator appointed at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Brian Garraway, deputy chairman of BAT Industries, is to become the first
chairman of a new regulatory board at Lloyd's of London, completing a round
of senior appointments at the insurance market.
As head of the new body, Mr Garraway will be responsible for monitoring
regulatory practice. He will work closely with Mr Peter Middleton, the chief
executive and head of Lloyd's market board, and Mr David Rowland, who is
expected to take over as chairman of the market at the end of this year. Mr
Middleton was appointed last month.
The market agreed to create the new regulatory and market boards in the
summer, acting on a report by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank,
which recommended the separation of business development from regulation and
a reduction in the size of the council, the market's governing body.
Mr Garraway, 61, has been with BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial
services group, since 1953 and has been a director on its main board since
1979. He is an accountant and worked in the group's tobacco businesses in
the UK and South America before overseeing BAT's diversification into
insurance in the 1980s. He retires from BAT Industries at the end of this
month,
Lloyd's also announced an improvement in the so-called 'hardship'
arrangements under which Names who are unable to meet their losses agree to
reschedule their debts.
Lloyd's Names, the people whose assets provide the market's capital, face
losses of Pounds 2.06bn for 1989, Lloyd's latest reported year.
The improvements, which will make life easier for Names suffering through
losses, are to be paid for from a Pounds 50m fund of contributions from
Lloyd's brokers and agents.
In a further change, new arbitration arrangements are to be introduced. They
are designed to reduce litigation between Names, their agents and the
Lloyd's Corporation.
The modification to Lloyd's hardship arrangements were announced by Dr Mary
Archer, who chairs the hardship committee.
The main change is to introduce wherever possible a fixed-term hardship
arrangement limiting recoveries by Lloyd's from a Name's income to a
three-year term.
Describing the changes as 'substantial and attractive', Dr Archer said the
new hardship arrangements were more comparable with bankruptcy.
A total of 131 Names who have negotiated hardship arrangements with Lloyd's
will be eligible to benefit. Dr Archer predicted that between 1,000 and
2,000 Names would require the arrangements.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE individuals connected with quoted companies will be able to receive
summary financial statements in place of full ones, under proposals issued
by the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday.
In a consultation document containing draft company legislation, the DTI
recommends that debenture and loan stock holders and partial owners of
shares should be able to receive summary statements.
Summary financial statements - which have been permitted since April 1990 -
include the basic profit-and-loss account with directors' remuneration, an
outline balance sheet and contingent liabilities.
They are designed to be easier to read, and provide more abbreviated
information than the full accounts, by excluding items such as cash flows
and detailed notes.
Under existing legislation, companies are allowed to send summary statements
to existing shareholders. The DTI said it was now extending the eligibility
after representations from some large companies.
That extends the facility to all those entitled to receive the full
accounts, and to those such as investors with partly paid shares in
privatisation issues.
The consultation document also highlights a number of other minor changes in
the regulations, including amendments for banks and dormant companies.
It asks for comments on the proposals and the costs of compliance. Any
submissions should be received by the DTI by November 6.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Protection urged for EC-aided projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT economic regeneration programmes that benefit from EC aid should
be protected from public-expenditure cuts, Mr Bruce Millan, EC Commissioner
for the regions, said last night.
In a lecture to the Audit Commission, Mr Millan warned that cuts in
government spending on such projects might break the 'additionality' rule,
part of the legislation governing the use of EC structural funds. The rule
forbade the use of such funds to replace government expenditure.
In February, the government gave undertakings that allowed the release of EC
regional fund money withheld because the Commission was not satisfied that
the additionality criterion would be met.
However, Mr Millan warned that the detailed implementation of the
undertakings was not yet 'fully clear'. He added that a strict application
of the additionality rule would mean that any funding of joint projects by
national governments should be 'exempt from public expenditure cuts'.
Mr Millan reiterated his commitment to a bigger role for the regions in
Europe, particularly in promoting EC economic development. The Commission
would develop its policy of dealing directly with regions in funding
regeneration programmes.
'Subsidiarity does not stop in London or in any other national capital,' he
said. 'Devolving more power to the regions to devise and implement their own
economic development strategies will give better results.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / Move to end power plant walkout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION officials will meet shop stewards this morning in an attempt to
resolve an unofficial walkout by more than 2,000 workers that has halted
construction of the Enron gas-fired power plant, Teeside, Chris Tighe
writes.
The workers - employed by the main contractor, Wimpey, and nearly 20
subcontractors - walked out on Monday in a protest over safety standards.
Enron Power Corporation said the safety issues had been addressed but the
men refused to return until Monday unless they received full payment for the
hours they had lost. The company had offered 10 hours money a man.
Enron has warned that the men are in breach of agreements and are risking
dismissal. Teesside officials of the main unions involved will today urge
the men to return to work immediately.
Construction of the plant, at Imperial Chemical Industries' Wilton site,
began nearly two years ago and is due to finish in January.

FT  09 OCT 92 / May Day holiday could be abolished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE May Day bank holiday might be abolished as early as 1995, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, the employment secretary, said yesterday, Bethan Hutton writes.
She said that the holiday, celebrated by many countries as Labour Day, had
been forced on Britain by the TUC.
One possible replacement would be an October holiday to commemorate the
Battle of Trafalgar but Mrs Shephard said her personal preference was for an
extra day added to the late August bank holiday, which might be less
disruptive to business than an isolated day. She promised to hold
consultations on the issue.
Any change would not apply to Scotland, which has had a May Day holiday for
longer than the rest of the UK.
Mrs Shephard also said that if an EC 48-hour working time directive were
adopted, the government would challenge it in the European court of justice.
'Despite the improvements we have won, we remain fundamentally opposed in
principle to this directive,' she said.
She later hinted that wages councils might be abolished in the Industrial
Relations Bill expected to go before parliament later this year.
Mrs Shephard said: 'Wages councils and mechanisms like that have no place in
today's labour market.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / Electricity price review starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVIEW of electricity price controls was launched yesterday by Professor
Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator.
It is the first review into the cost of supplying electricity since the
regional distribution companies of England and Wales were privatised nearly
two years ago. It comes at a time when consumers have been complaining about
rising electricity prices and what are seen as excessive profits made by the
regional companies.
The review will be 'searching and thorough', Prof Littlechild said. 'My main
aims are to secure a good deal for customers and promote more effective
competition, whilst ensuring that companies can finance their licensed
activities and have an incentive to purchase electricity efficiently.'
The review will lead to a new price regime to be introduced in April 1994.
The regional companies will be able to challenge the new regime with the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Supply costs account for about 5 per cent of electricity bills. There will
be a later review of prices charged for distributing electricity, for
implementation in April 1995. Those prices account for about 24 per cent
electricity bills.
Questions listed in a consultation paper include: should controls cover
sales to all customers or only those who do not have the benefit of
competition among their suppliers? Prof Littlechild is seeking comments by
December.
Electricity prices are governed at present by a formula that is intended to
keep increases below the rate of inflation.
The regional companies have come under fire over profit levels and one,
Seeboard, has voluntarily given a rebate to customers. The Major Energy
Users Council, which represents industrial electricity users, has also
mounted a campaign for tighter price controls.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Lord Moore to head 'green' energy trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD MOORE, the former cabinet minister, will be appointed within two weeks
as first chairman of the new Energy Saving Trust, one of the main planks in
the government's environmental policy.
His appointment ends a long hunt by the Department of the Environment for a
suitable candidate. The DoE has been criticised for the slow progress in
setting up the trust, which featured prominently in the Conservative general
election manifesto and in the government's statement in Rio at the Earth
Summit in June.
The trust, a limited company, was founded to identify energy-efficiency
projects in which British Gas and regional electricity companies will
invest. It is one of several proposals to help the UK meet internationally
agreed targets for reducing emissions of potentially harmful gases.
The trust will consider whether the costs of those investments should be
passed on to gas and electricity customers, which is ultimately the decision
of Offer and Ofgas, the industry regulators.
The delay in finding a chairman stalled the first three pilot projects that
British Gas was contemplating a year ago before its plans became subsumed in
proposals for the trust. It will now be possible to appoint a board of
directors that will include representatives of British Gas and the
electricity companies, as well as a majority of non-utility directors.
Lord Moore of Lower Marsh, once tipped as a possible successor to Margaret
Thatcher, left the political spotlight in 1988 when, as social security
minister, he became embroiled in the row over NHS reforms.
He had previously been a minister at the Department of Energy and later
financial secretary of the Treasury, where he was a vigorous free-market
proponent.
He is now executive chairman of the fund management arm of Credit Suisse.
The government hopes to keep the UK's emissions of carbon dioxide to within
157m-179m tons by the year 2000, compared to 160m in 1990, the Department of
Trade and Industry said yesterday.
The range reflects a number of developments in recent years, including new
proposals for more efficient gas-fired electricity generation, and
improvements in energy efficiency. It also reflects different assumptions
about both the level and structure of economic activity and about energy
prices.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Ferguson wins Pounds 16m ferries order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERGUSON Shipbuilders, based at Port Glasgow on the Lower Clyde, has won a
Pounds 16m contract to build two ferries to operate between Southampton and
the Isle of Wight.
The contract, with Red Funnel Ferries of Southampton, secures the future of
the shipyard until early 1995. Ferguson has been owned since early 1991 by a
consortium chaired by Sir Ross Belch, who once managed the Scott Lithgow
shipyard at Port Glasgow, now mothballed.
The 500-tonne ferries, 280 feet long, will each carry 700 passengers and 140
cars between Southampton and Cowes. Ferguson won the contract in the face of
competition from other yards.
The company was part of British Shipbuilders until 1989 when it was sold to
a private consortium. It was then sold to Kvaerner, the Norwegian company
which owns the Govan shipyard in Glasgow. Kvaerner sold it for Pounds
250,000 to Sir Ross Belch's group.
Ferguson employs 220 people and has built ferries and offshore oil service
vessels.
Mr Bill Scott, chief executive, said the award of the contract highlighted
'the pre-eminent position of Ferguson in the market for inter-island
ferries.'
It brought the total of orders won since privatisation to Pounds 50m,
'creating potential for increased employment'.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Export boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel's newest investment on Teesside is enjoying an increase in
exports, cushioning it against the recession in the UK construction
industry, Chris Tighe writes.
Yesterday Mr Barrie Cheetham (above), commercial director of British Steel's
general steels division, said the company anticipated keeping the mill fully
loaded 'into the planning horizon'.
The Pounds 82m mill, which makes beams and columns up to 27 metres long for
construction projects such as skyscrapers and bridges, has been working at
capacity since becoming fully operational in mid-summer.
The mill yesterday opened its doors for visits by UK and overseas customers.
It has substantially extended British Steel's range of heavy sections,
allowing it to win more export orders. The devaluation of the pound has also
helped it compete overseas.
Of its output, 85 per cent is being exported - mainly to the Far East and
central Europe. Its predecessor plant on Teesside was exporting half its
output two years ago. The proportion of exports has increased even though
the US construction industry, an important customer, has suffered a
downturn.
Mr Cheetham said structural sections was seen as one of British Steel's
strengths. 'Although we are in a recession, to have the benefit of a mill
like this is something our competitors would envy,' he said. 'With mills
like this we have the cost base, quality and project range to allow us to
compete very successfully in the export market.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (6): Mainland finds favour - Manufacturers
are moving into lower labour-cost centres overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S LOW-COST manufacturers are being forced to relocate overseas, as
rising wages, high land prices and a strong Taiwan dollar decrease
competitiveness and eat into profit margins.
'For the price of a factory worker in Taiwan, we can afford to employ 10
workers in China and 12 workers in Indonesia to do exactly the same job,'
says Mr Frank Kung, general secretary of Taiwan's Footwear Manufacturers'
Association
Before 1987 most overseas investment went to the US, one of Taiwan's closest
trading partners. Since 1988, however, the emphasis has turned to south east
Asian countries offering plentiful cheap land and labour.
According to government figures, Taiwanese companies have invested about
Dollars 2.1bn in Asia since 1989. By July 1992, the Taiwan government had
approved a total of Dollars 900m for Malaysia, Dollars 240m for the
Philippines, Dollars 278m for Indonesia and Dollars 358m for Thailand. These
figures do not include China where Taiwanese companies have invested, often
illegally, since 1987. Although estimates vary, probably more than Dollars
3bn has now flowed into the mainland. Together with other Asian investment,
this makes Taiwan probably the largest Asian investor in the region after
Japan.
Last year Taiwan was the biggest foreign investor in Malaysia and Indonesia,
investing a total of Dollars 602m in textiles, electronic and consumer goods
and footwear.
Poorer countries in the region have shown their willingness to encourage
foreign investors. Vietnam has liberalised its rules on foreign investment
since the late 1980s and Taiwanese companies have been quick to take
advantage.
By July this year, Taiwanese investment into Vietnam had reached Dollars
775m, more than any other country. Most of the projects were in chemicals,
textiles, bamboo and wood products and food processing.
Taiwan's government actively encourages investment overseas, since cash can
buy Taiwan the status and recognition it lacks in the diplomatic world.
Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore, have all signed investment
guarantee agreements with Taiwan, and another is being negotiated with
Vietnam, even though none of these countries recognises Taiwan politically.
In an attempt to spread investment more evenly in the region, Taiwan's
government has been plugging Vietnam as a viable, low-cost location. Direct
flights between Taiwan and Vietnam were started in August, and the
Kuomintang(KMT)'s Central Trade Development Corporation, along with a
subsidiary, has committed Dollars 450m to develop an export-processing zone
and surrounding infrastructure, near Ho Chi Minh City.
However, there are now signs Taiwan's investments in south east Asia may
have peaked, as investment into China has accelerated.
This 'mainland fever' is mainly due to a cheap investment environment and
common language and cultural ties. China's new commitment to economic
reform, signalled earlier this year, has also persuaded businessmen to push
ahead with projects which were on hold.
Most investment is in low-cost manufacturing and processing industries such
as garments and electrical goods for export. Although the Taiwanese started
by investing in the more open economies of Guangdong and Fujian, they are
now going further afield and have even started targeting China's domestic
market.
The government is increasingly concerned about the rate of investment in
China, fearing vulnerability to political and economic changes on the
mainland. China is also perceived as a fast-emerging competitor in the very
industries that Taiwan is moving across the Strait. The government has
therefore tried to prevent heavy and high technology industries from
investing in China.
However, many observers think the recent trend for larger Taiwan companies
to start looking at the mainland market will only continue.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (8): Hunt for cheaper locations - Taiwan is
being forced to upgrade its industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE the late 1980s, rising wages and property prices have narrowed profit
margins for Taiwan's low-cost manufacturers, while the unwillingness of an
increasingly well-off population to do low-status, low-paid factory work has
led to a tight labour market.
Faced with declining competitiveness, Taiwan is being forced to upgrade its
industry and replace low-cost manufacturing, which is increasingly
relocating to other cheaper Asian locations.
Appreciation of the Taiwan dollar against the US dollar has not helped.
Footwear manufacturers say that profit margins of between 5 and 12 per cent
when the Taiwan dollar was at 40 to the US dollar, were completely eaten
away when it appreciated to 25.
Hardest hit and first to move operations overseas were textile companies,
footwear manufacturers and producers of low value electronics. Manufacturing
output in these areas has fallen by about 29 per cent since 1986. For
example, production of electronic calculators fell from 68.3m sets in 1988
to 31.5m sets last year.
Output of heavy industries and chemicals has continued to increase. However,
falling margins have put pressure on companies' investment in research and
development.
The accelerating flow of investment overseas in recent months has led to
concern that Taiwan's industrial base is being eroded.
Meanwhile, as the economy matures, growth in services has consistently been
about 2 per cent higher than manufacturing. Some economists fear a serious
decline, or 'hollowing out', of Taiwan's industrial base. The Chung Hwa
Institute for Economic Research has warned that as low-technology industry
moves abroad, capital intensive industry must be upgraded and high
technology businesses fostered to maintain smooth economic growth.
The government is therefore offering tax holidays and low interest loans to
companies wishing to upgrade operations. Government officials claim 'tens of
billions' of Taiwan dollars will be available for this purpose, in the form
of a cabinet development fund, to be administered on a case-by-case basis.
It has also earmarked USDollars 22.7bn of a USDollars 303bn six-year
infrastructure plan for industrial upgrading and research and development.
Part of a USDollars 31.6bn budget for education and cultural facilities,
will also go to help lift the number of qualified and skilled workers.
Ten 'emerging industries' have been targeted for development, including
telecommunications, information technology, consumer electronics and
semiconductors.
Within these industries, eight 'key technologies' have been highlighted for
improvement, among them optoelectronics, industrial automation, advanced
sensing technology and biotechnology. The government hopes that a large
proportion of this technology will be imported, or made available as a
result of joint ventures with foreign companies.
One of the 10 selected industries is aerospace. Taiwan Aerospace, set up in
1991 to develop the island's aerospace industry, last month signed a
memorandum of understanding with British Aerospace for co-production of
regional aircraft. This should lead to significant transfers of technology
from the UK.
Taiwan's first semiconductor plant costing USDollars 152m is also a joint
venture, between Texas Instruments of the US and one of Taiwan's leading
computer manufacturers, Acer.
The government is also providing funds to companies wanting to improve
management and marketing skills. Because Taiwanese companies tend to be
small and family-managed, they have not emphasised marketing. Sports
equipment manufacturer Kunnan, which uses the brand name ProKennex, is one
of the few Taiwan companies which has achieved a measure of brand-awareness
globally.
Some economists say, however, that government loans and spending will only
help if the private sector simultaneously upgrades its industrial base.
Private sector's gross fixed capital formation actually fell in 1990 for the
first time since the early 1980s.
Investment has since accelerated but is growing slower than government or
public sector investment.
Meanwhile, there are signs foreign investment is slowing. In the first eight
months of this year investment fell 36 per cent to USDollars 870m while
manufacturing investment fell 54 per cent.
These figures are slightly distorted by legal changes which led to a rush of
investment early last year. But businessmen in Taipei said the same factors
which are forcing Taiwanese companies overseas, high costs and poor
infrastructure, are also affecting foreign investors.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (7): Keyed up for the world stage - Profile
of Acer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN manufacturers have not traditionally focused on marketing their own
brand-name product. Instead, they have favoured high-volume production of
low cost goods on an original equipment manufacture (OEM) basis, and the
comparatively low financial risk which OEM offers.
Acer, however, has always sought to be the exception. The company's
chairman, chief executive officer and founder, Mr Stan Shih, says he is in
the process of transforming Acer into a multinational computer company,
capable of competing with the main global players.
According to Mr Shih: 'Our aim is to motivate Taiwan's people to succeed in
removing the negative image of 'Made in Taiwan'.'
Although Mr Shih believes that he can only increase international awareness
of Acer products through marketing, Acer still relies on OEM for 30 per cent
of its business, a proportion which Mr Shih would like to see augmented to
45 per cent. 'On the whole OEM and our brand name business complement each
other,' he says. 'OEM is also a very good way to share the cost of
developing new technology.'
Underlying Acer's strategy is Mr Shih's personal blend of ancient Chinese
philosophy and modern management techniques.
'In the game of Go, first you conquer the periphery, then you conquer the
centre,' he explains. 'Because Acer is not yet big enough to compete with
the big US companies, we have found a niche in smaller markets, like South
America and south-east Asia.'
In Chile, says Mr Shih, people speak of Acer-compatible computers, rather
than IBM-compatible. 'We targeted the markets that none of the big players
had reached yet. So even with limited resources we were able to dominate
those markets,' he adds.
Acer was set up in 1976 as Multitech International with 11 employees, and
began production of IBM-compatible personal computers and software in the
early 1980s, using the same microchip and software as the IBM equivalent,
but selling for two-thirds of the price. By 1991, annual sales had totalled
around USDollars 1bn.
At a time when its competitors are hoping to sit out the downturn in the
global computer industry, Acer's own-brand business actually grew by 45 per
cent in 1991.
Acer has an annual corporate budget to boost brand awareness, of TDollars
25m, which is considered high by Taiwanese standards. It has also
restructured into a series of independent business units, designed to
decentralise decision-making, which can spend up to four times that amount
on marketing in various regions.
Earlier this year, a glossy Dollars 5m advertising campaign which uses
shadows thrown by Acer products to convey hidden qualities of the product
and images of the user, ran throughout Europe and the US. The 'shadows'
theme was conceived by Dentsu Young and Rubicam of the US, and is intended
to suggest that there is more to Acer than meets the eye.
Despite the emphasis on marketing, repeated attempts to penetrate the US
computer market have produced mixed results. In 1990, Acer tried to buy
market share by acquiring a financially stretched US minicomputer
manufacturer, Altos, for Dollars 94m.
The company had hoped to integrate its business hardware systems with Altos'
Unix-based systems thereby gaining a ready-made foothold in high end
production in the US. But minicomputers went out of fashion, and Altos
continued to lose money.
Analysts say Acer paid too much for the acquisition. Altos' losses, and
price-cutting due to the downturn in the computer market, led to Acer
reporting a net loss of USDollars 22.7m last year. However, Acer has since
reported net earnings of USDollars 3m in the six months ending June 30,
1992.
Acer's mass-merchandiser and superstore business fared somewhat better than
Altos in Europe and the US. The company's exports of lower end products
bound for outlets such as Best Buy and Bizmart of the US and Dixon's of the
UK grew by around 170 per cent in 1991.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (3): Standing at the crossroads - Angus
Foster investigates rising pressures in a showcase economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER

<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S showcase economy, which generated annual growth of 8 per cent
through the 1980s, is at the crossroads. On the surface, all appears well.
Growth is forecast to hit 7 per cent this year, after 7.3 per cent in 1991.
Unemployment is below 2 per cent and consumer price inflation, although
edging upwards, will probably average below 4 per cent for the year.
But declining competitiveness among Taiwan's low cost manufacturers, who
since the late 1980s have faced rising costs and an appreciating New
Taiwanese dollar, is forcing them to upgrade or move overseas to other,
cheaper Asian locations such as Indonesia and, increasingly, China.
Meanwhile, a maturing economy is adding new pressures such as a declining
savings rate, down 10 per cent to 29.5 per cent in five years, and rising
consumer spending.
Taiwan has overcome such hurdles before. With the largest central bank
foreign exchange reserves in the world, more than USDollars 88bn, the island
can also afford to increase government spending and guarantee growth while
the economy restructures. Nevertheless, new pressures and new costs
associated with moves towards democracy, such as tighter environmental
regulations, suggest growth in the 1990s will be slower and more erratic
than in the past decade.
Growth this year is being driven by consumer and government spending.
Consumer spending has risen since 1987 helped by annual average wage
increases of 10 per cent overall and up to 15 per cent in the service
sector. Growing affluence has lifted demand for foreign consumer goods,
which now account for more than 10 per cent of total imports for the first
time.
The government's six-year, USDollars 303bn National Development
infrastructure plan is now under way and government spending is forecast to
rise 20 per cent this year, compared to private sector investment growth of
5-6 per cent. The government's share of gross fixed capital formation is
forecast to reach 30 per cent this year, compared to 17 per cent in 1987.
To help finance the plan, the government ran a budget deficit of USDollars
10bn last year, the first time in nearly 20 years. The deficit is set to
rise further, to USDollars 15bn this year and nearly USDollars 20bn in the
peak spending year, although these figures will be less daunting if the
private sector is attracted into some of the projects. Mr Lee Chong-ying,
vice-minister of finance, said the government has no plans to raise taxes to
cut the deficit, although critics say tax increases are inevitable.
Although many of the infrastructure projects are welcomed, especially those
aimed at improving the island's transport network and energy supply, the
plan is widely assumed to be inflationary. The government has set a
medium-term inflation target of 3.5 per cent, but wages are continuing to
rise at close to 10 per cent and many economists think inflation will reach
upwards of 5 per cent, high by Taiwanese standards.
Mr Yu Tzong-shian, president of the Chung Hua Economic Research institute,
estimated inflation will rise to 4-5 per cent in the medium term, perhaps
higher 'if the plan is finished on time'.
Inflation will he helped, however, if the New Taiwanese dollar continues to
appreciate, pushing import prices down. After rising against the US dollar
by 50 per cent between 1986 and 1989, the Taiwanese unit has stabilised.
Further gains are likely in the next 12 months because of Taiwan's strong
trade position and pressure from the US, which claims the currency is being
kept artificially low.
Exports have continued to rise, in spite of world recession, thanks to
increased trade with China. For political reasons, this is conducted
indirectly, mainly through Hong Kong. Taiwan's exports to China increased 38
per cent for the first five months to USDollars 2.3bn while exports to the
US, still Taiwan's most important market, and Europe fell slightly.
About 95 per cent of exports are industrial products and total exports last
year increased 13 per cent to USDollars 76.2bn. For the first seven months
of this year exports rose 8.3 per cent from the comparable period to
USDollars 46.8bn.
But imports have risen faster, gaining 14 per cent to USDollars 41.3bn for
the year so far, leading to a 17 per cent reduction in the island's trade
surplus.
This is due to rising imports of consumer goods, capital equipment for
infrastructure projects and Taiwan's continuing reliance on Japanese
machinery and semi-conductor imports. Thirty per cent of total imports come
from Japan and this led to a USDollars 9.7bn trade deficit last year, a 27
per cent increase.
The deficit is likely to increase as infrastructure projects accelerate, and
will rise again if Taiwan's bid for membership of the GATT is successful.
Restrictions on Japanese car imports, protection of Taiwan's agricultural
products and discriminatory government overseas purchasing programmes, which
tend to favour the US and exclude Japan, will have to be reformed if Taiwan
is to join the trade body.
The continuing tight labour market has led to complaints from business of a
shortage of skilled and low skilled workers, which is adding to costs by
driving wages up. Although the government was initially reluctant to import
foreign labour, fearing it would stop companies upgrading, it has now
relented and approved the importation of up to 50,000 workers, mainly from
south-east Asia. But businessmen say this is not enough and wages will
continue to rise faster than inflation. Rapid wage rises are most noticeable
in newly reformed sectors of the economy. Earlier this year, for example, 15
new banking licences were granted, leading to intense competition for the
island's scarce supply of experienced commercial bankers.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (4): On the route for democracy - With
elections due in December, Angus Foster looks at politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN takes a significant step towards democracy in December with the first
fully representative elections to the Legislative Yuan, or parliament.
Constitutionally, this body approves the government budget and has authority
over a range of government bills. But its powers have rarely been used and
its credibility was undermined until last year because more than half its
members were elected in mainland China in 1947-48, before the Nationalist
government fled to Taiwan.
The old guard retired last December, paving the way for the direct election
on December 19 of 125 legislators, six representatives of overseas Chinese
communities and 30 'at large' seats decided by each party's vote in
constituency elections.
The new status likely to be accorded to legislators suggests the Yuan will
become more like a western parliament with questioning and debate of
government policy. Social issues could become more prominent.
Division on these and other issues could emerge within the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) party. A struggle for supremacy is also possible between the Yuan and
the National Assembly, which elects the president and adopts constitutional
amendments.
But Taiwan's progress towards full democracy, initiated with the lifting of
martial law in 1987, has so far been relatively smooth and the KMT is
expected to easily win a majority of the seats on offer in December. The
party will stress the island's economic success, steady moves to democracy
and stable relations with China as reasons to support the government.
'The great majority of voters are, economically speaking, doing well and
they are happy,' said James Chu, KMT spokesman.
The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, meanwhile, has been muted
since it campaigned on an independent Taiwan ticket in last year's elections
for the National Assembly. Although most Taiwanese support the existing
state of de facto independence, the campaign frightened people who believe
China's threat to use military force to reunify Taiwan if it seeks formal
independence. China, of course, still regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
The DPP polled only 24 per cent of votes and has decided to campaign on
other issues this time. It will attack the government's USDollars 306bn
infrastructure spending plans for being inflationary and likely to lead to
tax increases.
Mr Hsu Hsin-liang, DPP chairman, says he hopes his party will win 30 per
cent of the vote. He complained, justifiably, that in spite of moves to
democracy, elections are not fair. The KMT controls Taiwan's three
television stations and, because candidates need to spend Dollars 1m or more
getting elected, the KMT's links with business ensure it ample backing and
an in-built majority.
The DPP is seeking to tone down its popular image as a group of firebrand
radicals. Fist fights in the legislature, which were mainly designed for
show and reflected the opposition's frustration at being in such a minority,
are likely to die away. But the DPP's poor internal organisation suggests it
will take time for the party to decide whether it should be a responsible
opposition in a dominant party system, or return to merely a protest
movement.
The independence issue has not been resolved either, although it has been
temporarily shelved. According to opinion polls, most Taiwanese are happy
with their present state of de facto independence and would welcome eventual
reunification with a democratic China. But younger Taiwanese are less sure
and are frustrated by Taiwan's lack of international recognition. Taiwanese
also resent the continuing grip on power held by descendants of mainlanders
who fled to Taiwan in 1949 but make up less than 15 per cent of the
population.
Although Mr Lee Teng-hui is the island's first Taiwanese president, Mr Hau
Pei-tsun, who as premier has effective day-to-day control over the island,
and most of his senior cabinet are mainlanders. 'The line between Taiwanese
and mainlanders is still very clear,' said Mr Lin Yu-siong, a Taiwanese KMT
legislator.
This division is likely to come to the fore again next year in the lead up
to the KMT's party congress and is symbolised by a simmering dispute over
the method of election for the next presidential elections, due in 1996.
President Lee and his supporters are believed to be in favour of direct
elections while conservatives within the administration, many of them
mainlanders, would prefer elections through a form of electoral college to
limit the popular appeal of the president's office. The issue is further
complicated because elected members of the National Assembly fear their most
important function would be redundant if direct elections took place.
A heated debate on the issue within the KMT reached impasse in March and the
question has been put on hold. In a terse statement, the KMT said an
extraordinary meeting of the National Assembly will be held by May 1995 'to
select the method of electing the president and vice-president according to
public opinion'.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (5): A slow rebuilding of contacts - More
than 1m Taiwanese will visit China this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S relations with China have improved markedly following a series of
so called pragmatic initiatives by President Lee Teng-hui starting in the
late 1980s. But the widely differing views held by the two sides, and 40
years of open hostility, suggest further progress will be slow.
Taiwan last year recognised Beijing as the mainland's legitimate government.
It has also established government and quasi-government agencies to handle
cross-straits relations. Restrictions on visiting China and investing there
have slowly been lifted, although all contact must still be indirect. More
than a million Taiwanese are expected to visit China via Hong Kong this
year, compared with less than 7,000 in 1987. Trade through Hong Kong in the
first seven months of this year increased 34 per cent to more than Dollars
4bn.
The cautious opening to China is as important as other initiatives to
increase democracy and to lift Taiwan's international status. 'If we cannot
deal with the cross strait relationship, constitutional reform and
diplomatic improvements mean nothing,' said Mr Wu An-chia, convenor for
mainland affairs research at Chengchi University.
In return for its policy changes, Taiwan wants Beijing to recognise it as an
equal political entity, allow Taiwan more international ties, and renounce
the threat to re-unify Taiwan using force.
But China, which still sees Taiwan as a renegade province, is not prepared
to confer any legitimacy on its government. China's position is that Taiwan
should accept a solution based on 'one country, two systems', as negotiated
with Hong Kong. Taiwan is being offered more autonomy than Hong Kong,
however. For example it could keep control of its defence forces.
The impasse has stalled progress on relaxation of Taiwan's ban on direct
air, shipping and postal links with the mainland. Taiwan's national
unification guideline, setting out the limits to mainland policy, makes
clear lifting the ban is not a near-term objective. But pressure from
Taiwan's businessmen, who say the ban increases costs of investing in China,
has led to hopes the ban could be eased.
Taiwan's government seems more concerned to maintain the ban as an important
negotiating position with which to squeeze concessions from China at a later
stage. Meanwhile, China is also refusing to soften its stance on the use of
force. This again is partly a negotiating position, and China also sees the
threat as a way to limit the ambitions of Taiwan's independence movement.
Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party campaigned for independence
during last year's national Assembly elections. After the party polled only
24 per cent of the votes, the issue has been sidelined, thus averting a
serious rift with Beijing.
Most people in Taiwan are happy to maintain the island's present de facto
independence, but do not support open calls for a split with Beijing.
Assuming political and economic reform accelerates in China, reunification
is regarded as a long-term inevitability.
In the short term, civilian and unofficial contacts will be built up and
work will continue on problems stemming from both sides' refusal to
recognise the other's legal system. Taiwan's government-funded Straits
Exchange Foundation, which handles direct negotiations with China's equally
non-governmental Association for relations Across the Taiwan Straits, has
been negotiating endorsement of documents and indirect mail services with
the Chinese. Discussions were aborted in March after the Chinese suddenly
raised issues of sovereignty. 'I urged them not to mix politics with
technical matters,' said Mr Chen Rong-jye, SEF secretary general.
Slow progress on China relations is also frustrating Taiwan's ambitions to
boost its international status. South Korea's August decision to switch
recognition from Taiwan to China was a severe blow to the island, removing
its last Asian diplomatic ally.
Taiwan now has full diplomatic relations with 29 countries, although many -
like Tonga and Guinea-Bissau - are only of symbolic importance. Worryingly,
China seems keen to improve relations with South Africa, the only large
country which still recognises Taiwan.
Taiwan has made progress improving unofficial links with France, especially,
and with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Taiwan has also stepped up
efforts to gain admission to international bodies, and was last year
admitted along with China to the Asian Pacific Economic Conference grouping
under the compromise title Chinese Taipei.
China probably assented to simultaneous entry as a precursor to dual entry
to the Gatt. At the moment, the US is in favour of simultaneous entry,
perhaps next year. Although entry would harm Taiwan by abolishing some
import restrictions, membership is seen as a diplomatic imperative in
Taipei.
One recent development, the slightly distasteful 'bidding wars' between
Taiwan and China for recognition by third world governments, may not last.
Growing democracy in Taiwan makes episodes such as last year's stealing of
Niger from China harder to justify. 'People don't want their taxes spent on
black Africa,' one analyst said.

SWEDEN and Norway are sending back substantial quantities of Danish pigmeat
on the grounds that it contains salmonella bacteria.
'The Swedes are hysterical,' commented Mr Benth Sloth, chairman of the
Danish Bacon and Meat Export Council, who alleged that the Swedes are more
interested in protecting their own market than they are in the health of
their people.
The Swedes, said a council press release, are looking very hard for
bacteria, taking 10 times as many samples as they used to do, as well as
applying the most stringent regulations in the world.
The shipments of pork tenderloin that have been refused have been sold in
Denmark without any objections by the veterinary authorities or the Consumer
Council.
However, the Danish veterinary directorate is already initiating a
'microbiological action plan' which it says should reduce the incidence of
bacteria considerably.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel producers fail to follow
Inco's output cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NICKEL PRODUCERS are currently showing little enthusiasm for production cuts
similar to those announced by Inco earlier this week, despite a continuing
surplus of metal on world markets.
Both the French producer SLN (Societe Metallurgique le Nickel) and Finland's
Outokumpu said yesterday that they have no plans to cut output over the next
few months.
Falconbridge, the biggest western producer after Inco, said yesterday that a
production cut is 'likely', but that no decision will be made for at least a
few weeks. 'Each operation is looking at its plans and reviewing options,'
the company said.
Inco plans to trim production by 40m lbs over the next 12 months, bringing
next year's expected output down to 380m lbs.
However, the Toronto-based company also affirmed its determination to
maintain its 25 to 30 per cent share of the western nickel market. Inco has
bought substantial quantities of metal on the LME over the past year.
Inco's cut will reduce worldwide production by about 3 per cent, but
preliminary figures indicate that nickel output exceeded consumption by 14
per cent in the third quarter.
The imbalance is due largely to stagnant demand from the stainless steel
industry, which accounts for some 60 per cent of nickel consumption, and a
sharp rise in Russian shipments.
Mr Ray Goldie, metals analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto,
predicted yesterday that 'Inco's cutbacks won't be enough'. With Russia
unlikely to rein in its exports, Mr Goldie said the burden is likely to fall
on western producers such as Falconbridge.
His prediction is confirmed by the lacklustre response of nickel prices to
Inco's decision. Cash nickel on the London Metal Exchange fell back to close
at Dollars 6,620 a tonne, down Dollars 70 on the day and Dollars 85 on the
week so far.
SLN chairman Mr Yves Rambaud told Reuters that the renovation of one of
three smelters had already reduced the company's production this year, and
he saw no need to consider further cuts. The renovated smelter was brought
back into service in August, but Mr Rambaud said that Eramet's stocks are
'very low'. The group expects its nickel output to fall to some 39,000
tonnes in 1992, down from 43,500 tonnes in 1991.
An Outokumpu official told Reuters that 'We do not have need for such cuts
and there are no plans for such measures'. He noted that the company's total
nickel output of 13,800 tonnes a year is less than Inco's planned cut.

Three-month COPPER prices, which were in retreat early, rallied above
Dollars 2,300 a tonne in afternoon trading on the LME, aided by the trend in
New York. But dealers said as the fundamental picture is negative - with
economic activity sluggish and consumers unwilling to chase prices higher -
the market could turn down again. GOLD was steady on the London bullion
exchange as the dollar pulled back sharply on rumours that the US Fed was
planning to cut rates. The metal was fixed at Dollars 350.50 a troy ounce in
the afternoon, up 50 cents from its early setting. A rise in US equities and
positive US retail sales figures buoyed PLATINUM, which recovered to just
below resistance at Dollars 360 after fixing earlier at Dollars 356.80. But
reports of a Japanese market awash with platinum and Tocom investors selling
nearby positions weighed on sentiment. London COCOA ended near the day's
lows following origin selling. News that the German grind for the third
quarter was 12.9 per cent above last year appeared to have little effect on
prices. 'The fact that the origins are selling means there's more cocoa in
the market to offset the impact of the better usage,' one dealer said.

monopoly
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government indicated yesterday that the Wheat Board's export
monopoly may be abolished if the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) are successful.
Mr Simon Crean, primary industries minister, said the board's single-desk
marketing system provided the best protection for farmers from the
continuing export subsidies battle between the European Community and the
US.
He said immediate deregulation of export sales would expose individual
sellers of Australian wheat to the danger of being 'picked off' in the
'corrupted' world market.
However, Mr Crean said the government would review the monopoly if the Gatt
negotiations led to a liberalisation of world trade in agricultural goods.
Australian officials have suggested recently that agreement may be possible
soon.
The government has come under pressure to deregulate the wheat market from
international grain traders and US farmers' organisations, which claim the
board distorts trade by manipulating export prices.

rubber supply
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's key rubber producers have agreed to draw up plans to co-ordinate
their production and marketing strategies to beat weak prices, but Malaysia
said the move will not amount to a producer cartel, Reuter reports from
Kuala Lumpur.
The Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC), whose members
account for over 80 per cent of world output, said at the end of a two-day
meeting in Malaysia that it has set up a committee to formulate the plans.
It said the move would help bring about a supply and demand balance which
'would favour remunerative prices for rubber'.
Senior Malaysian officials said the measure would not amount to a production
cartel or production quotas. 'It is merely aimed at maintaining a balance
between supply and demand. It will help avoid an excess supply,' one said.
Rubber prices have been declining steadily for the past three years, falling
to their lowest since 1986 in December. They have recovered only slightly
since.
Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told the meeting on
Tuesday that the present trend is towards a supply glut due to the slowdown
in industrial activity in Western countries as well as higher Asian and
African output.
The London-based International Rubber Study Group has forecast a rubber
surplus of 150,000 tonnes in 1992, down from a 180,000 tonne surplus in
1991, Mr Lim said, though this could be even higher because OECD growth
prospects have been downgraded.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greek farmers dump half their
bumper peach crop - With falling exports and limited canning capacity, the
surplus just keeps growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful smell of fermenting fruit escapes from trucks lumbering up a
hillside outside Skydra, the centre of commercial peach-growing in Greece. A
bulldozer works full-time at the dump, pushing piles of unsold peaches into
an uncultivated valley.
This year marked a record Greek peach harvest, estimated by growers at over
900,000 tonnes. But the surplus is also of unprecedented size, with more
than half the crop being transported straight from orchards to the dump.
Greece, together with the US and South Africa, is one of the world's biggest
exporters of canned peaches. Over 90 per cent of the processed crop is sold
abroad, much of it to supermarket chains from Britain to Japan. Greece is
also a big producer of table peaches.
Despite cuts in EC support prices this year and next - both for marketed
produce and withdrawals - the surplus will go on rising as more orchards
come into full yield.
'The EC support prices were extremely high, even for withdrawal, and until
the late 1980s there was always a shortage of industrial peaches. Growers
thought production could go on expanding indefinitely,' says Mr Alexander
Protopappas of Conex, a processor.
The growing is done by 20,000 small farmers in the northern Greek provinces
of Verria, Edessa and Naoussa, where a cooler climate favours fruit
production. In recent years, there has been a shift to yellow clingstone
varieties for processing, considered by farmers a safer option than growing
table peaches for the volatile European export market.
However, the average orchard size is only about three acres, a factor that
contributes to increased surpluses as individual farmers follow their
neighbours' example and switch to peach-growing. Peach production has almost
tripled since the early 1980s, with new orchards planted on terraces cut
higher into the hillsides around Skydra.
Production of yellow clingstones will probably reach 650,000 tonnes this
year, up from 480,000 tonnes in 1991. Yet processing capacity is stuck at
250,000 tonnes.
'Greek peaches are considered top quality and we'd have no difficulty in
raising exports if we had the capacity,' says Mr Eleftherios Saitis of
Kronos, another large packer. 'The canned peach market may be stabilising
but there's a future in products like concentrate, pulps and peach chips for
flavourings.'
There seems little chance that capacity will soon increase. Most canneries
were set up by agricultural co-operatives a decade ago when farm exports
were still subsidized and interest rates for agricultural loans lagged far
behind the inflation rate.
No longer protected by subsidies, the co-operatives are deep in debt to the
state-controlled Agricultural Bank, while private canners like Mr Saitis say
they cannot afford to expand with borrowing rates at around 30 per cent.
But so long as support prices remain attractive, the growers will go on
producing. 'It will be hard to make peach farmers change crops unless the EC
starts paying compensation for uprooting trees. Their income is still
satisfactory even if they drive their whole crop to the dump,' says Mr
Antonis Kanouras of Agrotiki Kolindros, a local growers' co-operative.
Nevertheless, there are still shortages at the canneries in July and
September, at the beginning and end of the processing season, because
growing policies were never co-ordinated with the processors.
'If there were more producers of early and late cropping varieties, we could
prolong the season for a few weeks and cover more of the demand for
exports,' says Mr Kanouras.
However, the industrial peach sector is still well off by comparison with
what has happened to producers of table peaches. This year's crop, estimated
at 230,000 tonnes plus another 100,000 tonnes of nectarines, was also a
record. But a disastrous export season means that the withdrawal rate is
even higher than for industrial peaches.
The conflict in the former Yugoslavia has blocked the main export route to
western Europe. The alternative route to the Munich fruit market, by ferry
to Italy or by road through Hungary, takes 24 hours longer and costs
one-third more at times of peak demand for refrigerated trucks.
Greek peaches normally command premium prices because of their quality. But
that edge may be lost after an extra day on the road. Moreover, wholesale
prices for peaches have tumbled following bumper harvests across southern
Europe. This year, exports of Greek table peaches and nectarines have fallen
by 35 per cent to 60,000 tonnes.
'Costs are so high in proportion to prices that the Greek exporters are
scarcely breaking even this year. The recession has shrunk demand in western
Europe where peaches are seen as a luxury fruit,' says Mr Constantine
Karagiorgas of Incofruit, the Greek fruit exporters' association.

CONSOLIDATED sales of Roche, the Basle-based pharmaceutical and speciality
chemicals group, rose only 6.3 per cent in the third quarter to SFr3.04bn
(Dollars 2.4m), but the group said it expected 'another considerable
improvement' in net profit for the year, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The sales growth rate in the third quarter was sharply lower than the 19 per
cent recorded in the first half. Roche said the sales trend was affected by
the shift of currency effects from positive to negative in the third quarter
and by disposals in the diagnostic division and a minor seasonal effect.
Roche expects 'a further healthy growth in sales' in the fourth quarter, and
this appeared to relate to its highlighting of the 15 per cent sales growth
to SFr9.7bn in the nine months to September 30.
Sales by the pharmaceutical division soared 20 per cent in the nine months
to SFr5.09bn.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: BNP disappoints with fall of
13.4% in first half
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP) yesterday added to the stream of
disappointing interim results from France's big banks by announcing a fall
in first-half profits.
BNP, like other French banks, was affected in the first half both by
economic slowdown and by the need to raise provisions, mainly because of the
depressed French property market. Net profits fell by 13.4 per cent to
FFr1.33bn (Dollars 271m) in the first six months of this year from FFr1.54bn
in the corresponding 1991 period.
Mr Rene Thomas, chairman, commented that banking had become 'a dangerous
business' in the uncertain economic climate.
The French banking sector, in which BNP is the third-largest, has become
increasingly competitive. The market is overcrowded and relatively high
French interest rates in the late 1980s and early 1990s has dampened demand
for consumer and corporate credit.
BNP has been in the vanguard of the attempts by French banks to improve
their competitiveness. It managed to contain the increase in its own
overheads to just 1.9 per cent in the first half - with FFr13.88bn, against
FFr13.61bn in the first six months of 1991 - thanks to cost controls.
The increase in BNP's costs was below both France's annual inflation rate -
at around 3 per cent - and its 3.3 per cent increase in first-half net
banking income to FFr19.48bn from FFr18.86bn. As a result, operating profits
rose by 6.8 per cent to FFr5.61bn from FFr5.25bn.
But BNP was forced to raise provisions by 13.6 per cent to FFr4.11bn from
FFr3.62bn because of the economic slowdown on its property holdings and
corporate loans. Mr Thomas warned the situation was unlikely to improve in
the second half.
BNP is the latest French bank to report a drop in interim profits. Credit
Lyonnais just managed to break even, after a hefty rise in provisions.
Banque Indosuez was in a similar situation and Paribas only avoided a
dramatic decline in its interim profits though the proceeds of its disposal
programme.
Credit Local de France (CLF), the French bank which last autumn became the
first candidate for the government's partial privatisation programme,
expects to increase net profits by up to 10 per cent this year, according to
Mr Pierre Richard, chairman.
CLF recently bucked the trend in French banking by announcing a 6 per cent
rise in net profits to FFr663.9m.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Weak markets contribute to
Perstorp's 26% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSTORP, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, said
yesterday that pre-tax profits fell 26 per cent to SKr225m (Dollars 41.3m)
in its financial year to August 31 from SKr305m in the previous 12 months.
Group sales rose 8 per cent to SKr7.33bn from SKr6.77bn, but this was due to
acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, sales fell 1 per cent.
The group said weak market conditions were partly to blame for the fall in
profits. But it added that increased depreciation, following an aggressive
investment programme, and low profitability in some of the companies it had
bought, were also significant factors.
Despite the acquisitions, the group's financial position remained strong,
with the year-end equity ratio amounting to 44 per cent. Rationalisation
measures continued, cutting the workforce by 5 per cent over the year.
Profit per share fell to SKr7.60 from SKr8.40. The dividend, after
adjustment for a bonus issue, is unchanged at SKr4.55 per share
The group is waiting for Italian government approval for its proposed
co-operation with Italy's EniChem in the field of industrial grade
laminates. The political situation in Italy has considerably delayed final
approval, Perstorp stated.

loss

THE off-balance-sheet losses suffered by Ciments Francais of France, the
French cement maker being taken over by Italy's Italcementi group, are
thought to have stemmed from agreements to repurchase shares in the
company's foreign subsidiaries.
Details are not available about the size, timing, or location of the
transactions. However, they are believed to have taken place after the
French group's recent international expansion.
On Wednesday, Ciments Francais admitted to losses on off-balance sheet
financial dealing. Mr Pierre Conso resigned as chairman following an
emergency board meeting.
Italcementi announced the surprise acquisition of a 34 per cent stake in
Ciments Francais last April, in a deal lauded in Italy after a string of
unsuccessful big cross-border takeover attempts by other Italian groups.
However, while investors welcomed the continuing international expansion of
Italcementi, many were unhappy about the terms of a linked rights and
convertible bond issue to finance the transaction, while a share placing by
Ciments Francais in July was poorly received in the French market.
The transactions, thought to have been known to a very limited group of
managers, involved selling shares in mostly foreign subsidiaries for cash,
subject to an agreement to repurchase them later. The arrangements were made
with a variety of third parties, including banks.
Financial transactions kept off a company's balance sheet and regularly
rolled-over have been used as a means of hiding losses in the hope of
plugging the gap later.
Ciments Francais, which is the subject of a 'due diligence' examination by
KPMG, the international accounting and consulting group employed by
Italcementi, is believed to have used both the cash and interest from the
repurchase arrangements.
The French group is reviewing its accounts for the first half of the year
following disclosure of the losses. Having expected to publish its interim
results almost two weeks ago, it will not now release official first half
figures until next month at the earliest.
The board is expected to examine outline results when it meets later this
month.
Ciments Francais shares yesterday fell sharply on the Paris stock market
when they returned to trading after being suspended on Wednesday.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (1): Strength wins recognition - In five
years the island has changed course. Once an autocracy, it is now a
quasi-democracy. Its frosty relations with mainland China have thawed, and
import and other barriers are slowly being removed. But there has been a
price to pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JUST five years ago Taiwan was an autocracy run by the Nationalist
government which fled China's mainland after the civil war in 1949. The
economy was successful, but highly discriminatory against foreign
competition. Relations with the Chinese communists, who still regard Taiwan
as a renegade province, remained hostile and Taiwan's international standing
was at a nadir.
Today, Taiwan is a quasi democracy with its first Taiwanese, as opposed to
Chinese, president in Lee Teng-hui. Its economy remains successful, in spite
of world recession, while import and other barriers are slowly being
removed. Family visits and trade with China are growing rapidly and the two
sides are holding regular, if unofficial, talks. Last month, as a rites of
passage for the island's economic emergence, its application to join the
Gatt was accepted for serious consideration.
Such rapid change has not come without a price. To cope with new demands,
the government budget is in deficit for the first time in nearly 20 years.
As affluence has increased, Taiwan's saving rate has fallen from Asian to
western levels, and crime and divorce rates are both rising sharply.
Neither is Taiwan's future as a stable democracy secure. Infighting is
taking place within the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) about proposed presidential
elections in 1996. This, broadly speaking, pits conservative mainlanders
against more liberal Taiwanese party members. The KMT, guaranteed support
from government-owned television and big business, enjoys a monopoly on
power while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party has yet to prove it
can act as a credible oppostion.
Meanwhile, China has not withdrawn its threat to use force against Taiwan,
especially if the island were formally to declare independence. Although the
Taiwanese are sure they do not want reunification with a communist China,
they are uncertain how to improve the relationship without radical changes
in China's ideological position.
December elections for the legislative yuan, or paliament, mark the next
test for the democratic reforms instituted by President Lee since 1987. The
old guard of legislators elected in China in 1947-48, who sat in the yuan
unchallenged and unchallenging for more than 40 years, were retired last
year making way for Taiwan's first fully representative parliamentary
elections for 161 seats.
The KMT is assured of victory, and campaigning is set to be less explosive
than in last year's election for the lower profile national assembly, which
adopts consitutional amendments. In those elections the DPP campaigned to
formalise Taiwan's present de facto independence, leading to angry rebukes
from China. But the independence call appeared to worry voters. This time
the DPP will concentrate on attacking ballooning government spending and
forecast tax increases stemming from a USDollars 303bn six-year national
development plan.
The plan is designed to redress a decade of neglect of the island's
transport and energy facilities, and improve its deteriorating environment.
Many of the projects are welcomed, especially those improving traffic jams
in the capital, Taipei. But it has been criticised for being hastily drawn
up and likely to add to inflation, which is heading for 4-5 per cent - high
by Taiwanese standards. Financing the plan pushed the government budget into
deficit last year, the first time in recent history. This year's deficit is
forecast to rise 33 per cent to nearly USDollars 14bn.
Nevertheless, increased government spending will ensure continued economic
growth. This is forecast to rise 7 per cent this year, after 7.3 per cent
last year. Unemployment will remain below 2 per cent, helped by a rapidly
expanding service sector. A resulting labour shortage suggests recent
average wage increases of 10 per cent are set to continue.
Taiwan's economic growth is impressive, especially in the face of recession
in its principal export market, the US. But the economy now needs to
restructure away from low cost manufacturing, its traditional engine of
growth. Since the late 1980s low cost manufacturers have lost
competitiveness due to rising land and labour costs and a 50 per cent
appreciation in the new Taiwan dollar. This has forced many to relocate to
cheaper Asian locations, such as Indonesia, and, especially since relations
have improved, China.
Although economists agree this process was inevitable, the government is
worried it will prevent Taiwan's industry from upgrading. Government grants
and tax credits are being increased to persuade companies to invest in
automation and research. But these programmes have so far had mixed success,
and Taiwan still largely relies on imported Japanese and US technology.
This year has seen another setback as foreign investment has fallen sharply,
dropping 32 per cent to Dollars 7.6bn in the first seven months. The decline
may be temporary, relecting downturn in Japan, and changes in investment
laws. But foreign investment does seem increasingly to be aimed at service,
rather than manufacturing industries, suggesting Taiwan's efforts to upgrade
industry, helped by foreign technology transfer may be frustrated.
After registering almost no growth in 1990, exports have recovered, helped
by a stable new Taiwanese dollar and increasing exports to China. Because
Taiwan maintains a ban on direct links with China, most trade is conducted
through Hong Kong. Exports to newly-built Taiwanese factories in China
helped lift total trade with China 34 per cent to more than Dollars 4bn in
the first seven months of this year.
Relations with China have improved markedly since Taiwan lifted its ban on
visits to the mainland in 1987. But the two sides are still separated by
huge ideological differences and 40 years of mistrust. Although cultural and
unofficial contacts are rising, further progress towards normalising
relations will be very slow.
Last year Taiwan ended its National Mobilisation for Suppression of the
Communist Rebellion, effectively recognising Beijing as the legitimate
government for the mainland. Taiwan hoped this would lead to formal
recognition by Beijing but China has consistently refused to grant any
legitimacy to Taiwan's government and refuses all offers of official talks
or visits.
Increasing trade links with China have led to calls from Taiwan's
businessmen for bans on the three tongs - direct shipping, air links and
postal services - to be lifted. But this would require the two governments'
mutual recognition of security arrangements and air service agreements. Even
if China agreed to modify its non-recognition of Taiwanese sovereignty,
Taiwan may delay lifting the three bans to squeeze further concessions from
China at a later stage.
Beijing's continued opposition to the extension of diplomatic recognition to
Taiwan by third countries has frustrated the island's quest for
international ties. In August, South Korea, Taiwan's last diplomatic ally in
Asia, withdrew recognition in favour of China. Taiwan now has full
diplomatic relations with 29 countries, of which only South Africa is
internationally important.
But Taiwan has had more success gaining entry to international bodies. As
well as the Gatt application, it last year joined the Asia Pacific Economic
Conference under the politically neutral title of Chinese Taipei.
Growing economic power is also bringing greater informal recognition from
European countries, especially those, such as France, which believe their
companies can win contracts under the six-year plan. Following the US
decision in September to sell up to 150 F-16s to Taiwan, a separate purchase
of up to 60 French Mirage fighters is still expected to go ahead. This would
further improve Taiwan-French ties, and provide the island with a
symbolically important quasi-ally in Europe.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: Harmony dissidents claim support
from institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL SHAREHOLDERS at Harmony Leisure are requisitioning an extraordinary
meeting to try to oust the directors of the loss-making restaurant and pub
group, following a 70 per cent increase in pre-tax losses.
Former hotelier Mr Andrew Martyr, the leader of the dissident group, said
attempts to install a new management team had been boosted by pledges of
support from institutional shareholders after the company announced losses
this week of Pounds 3.68m for the year to March 29.
'The institutions have decided all is not well and they are now supporting
us,' Mr Martyr said yesterday.
An EGM is expected to be held immediately after Harmony's annual meeting
next month.
Calls for management changes have gathered pace with the dramatic slide in
the share price, which has fallen from 79p to 6p since 1990.
'Shareholders have lost a considerable amount of money,' said Mr Martyr.
Queens Moat, the hotel group which has a 14.5 per cent stake in Harmony, has
expressed concern at the losses. Southend Property Holdings, with a 4 per
cent interest, confirmed it had been asked to support the rebels.
Both companies said they will wait to examine the final accounts, expected
to be published next week.
Mr Stanley Lever, managing director of Harmony, has vowed to fight any moves
to remove the existing board.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: Indications of changing demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW indices announced yesterday by the Financial Times, the
International Stock Exchange and the Institute and the Faculty of Actuaries
resulted from an attempt to improve and extend the existing indices covering
the UK market.
A working party, including representatives from every sector of the
investment community, was set up to consider these issues.
It rapidly became clear that market participants were happy with the
operation of the FT-SE 100 index, as the principal real-time index for UK
stocks, and with the FT-A All-Share, the market's main end-of-day
performance measurement benchmark.
However they wanted to extend the approach taken by these indices in a
number of ways:
Mid-sized companies - There was a need for a definitive real-time index
covering the next tier of companies below the FT-SE 100. The exact size of
this group was the subject of much discussion, and some research among
investment managers to establish their view on what a 'mid-sized' company
meant.
The committee settled on a tranche of 250 companies ranking immediately
below the FT-SE 100 in size. These companies have market capitalisations in
the region of between Pounds 150m and Pounds 1bn, based on share values at
mid-year.
The largest company in the FT-SE Mid 250 is Standard Chartered, with a
capitalisation now of Pounds 1.1bn and the smallest is Newman Tonks, with a
capitalisation of Pounds 120m.
Real-time industry baskets - The FT-A All-Share provides detailed
sector-by-sector breakdowns of performance at the end of each day, published
the following morning in the FT on the page that carries the London Stock
Market report.
Until now, there has been no way to track the performance of industry
sectors minute-by-minute or to attribute the relative performance of sectors
to a particular news event. It would not have made sense, however, to base
real-time industry baskets on the FT-SE 100, as the sector distribution of
companies within the index is patchy.
What was needed was a group of companies traded with sufficient frequency to
make real-time prices meaningful and yet close enough in performance to the
All-Share to make the industry baskets good intra-day substitutes for the
end-of-day All-Share sectors.
The obvious choice was a universe of 350 stocks, the FT-SE 100 plus the new
FT-SE Mid 250. Baskets that mirror the sector classification of the
All-Share will be calculated minute-by-minute on these companies. In time,
derivative contracts (futures and options) may be established on some of the
more interesting and active baskets. The FT will publish the hour-by-hour
changes in some of the baskets, but the newspaper's principal sectoral
breakdown will continue to be the end-of-day All-Share sub-indices.
The FT-SE Actuaries 350, the group of stocks on which the industry baskets
will be calculated, may also serve another purpose. It may come to be
regarded as a 'liquid benchmark', the working definition of the universe of
stocks to which most investors direct most of their attention.
As the table shows, the FT-SE Actuaries 350 will cover 92 per cent of the
total capitalisation of the UK stock market, a significant advance on the 72
per cent covered by the FT-SE 100.
A larger FT-A All-Share - At its peak, over the last three decades, the
All-Share has contained about 720 shares. Over time, takeovers and
bankruptcies have reduced that number. It seemed time to establish whether
the current size of 653 shares was the correct one.
Despite its name, the All-Share has never attempted to cover all the more
than 2,000 UK securities listed by the Stock Exchange. Instead it has
focused on the 'investible universe', those shares in which there is a
liquid enough market to allow the patient investor to accumulate a position
over time, and to sell out gradually when it was time to take profits or cut
losses.
Investment managers indicated a desire to see a slightly higher proportion
of the total market covered. From the end of the year the All-Share will be
extended by roughly 200 shares, to cover approximately 98 per cent of the
total UK market.
At the same time, a new FT-SE Small Cap index will reflect the movement of
those All-Share members which lie below the FT-SE Actuaries 350 in terms of
market capitalisation. Like the All-Share, this will be an end-of-day index.
It will be calculated in two ways, including investment trusts and excluding
them. Companies will only be eligible for the All-Share if their stocks
trade at least every other day. This 'liquidity screen' is designed to
exclude a handful of stocks that are very tightly held, and almost never
trade. It will not affect the great bulk of current FT-A All-Share members.
A consistent series - One clear message the working group received was a
desire to have a consistent series of indices, with a common set of ground
rules and procedures, and no overlap. A company should either be in the
FT-SE 100, or in the FT-SE Mid 250, or in the FT-SE Small Cap, but not in
more than one of them. Thus a small company will start outside the
All-Share. As it grows, it will qualify for All-Share membership on the
grounds of size and liquidity, and will initially find itself in the Small
Cap portion of the index. In time it can hope to rise in market
capitalisation sufficiently to enter first the FT-SE Mid 250, and then
ultimately the FT-SE 100. At each point, its eligibility will be governed by
the same rules, and the same calculations will determine price, yield and so
on.
Independent management - The arcane and complex rules that govern the way an
index runs - necessary to cope with the ever more complex capital structures
of late twentieth century companies - can occasionally become contentious.
It was important, therefore, to have a unified set of committees to run the
new indices, under a strong and independent chairman. The FT, the Stock
Exchange and the Actuaries have set up an independent steering committee,
overseeing practitioner committees which will carry out the
quarter-by-quarter decisions which make the indices tick. The task of seeing
that these indices continue to meet the needs of investors - as the
All-Share and the FT-SE 100 have done - now falls to them.

investors

THE NEW stock market indices recognise a growing demand from investors for a
wider range of real-time benchmarks against which to develop investment
strategies and judge their performance.
In recent years the FT-SE 100 and the FT-A All Share Index of 653 stocks
have been challenged by fund management firms which have designed their own
proprietary indices to measure the performance of key market segments.
Hoare Govett's Smaller Companies Index has been matched by a similar one
from County NatWest, and James Capel has developed its own 'Tootsie' index
of the 100 companies ranking just below the FT-SE 100 in terms of market
capitalisation.
Now, the creation of new indices bearing the FT-SE imprimatur, which focus
on medium-sized and smaller companies are expected to provide a boost to
specialised fund management.
'There is a growing move towards specialisation in the fund management
business,' said Mr David Twiss, general manager of MAP Securities, a fund
management firm specialising in quantitative techniques. 'You will now have
recognised benchmarks to measure performance against.'
While clients such as pension fund trustees may once have handed their
portfolio to a single manager to run a balanced fund, the new benchmarks may
encourage trustees to break up their portfolios, handing a part to a smaller
companies expert or one specialising in the new FT-SE Actuaries 350.
Moreover, says Mr Robert Brown, head of the structured equity group at
County NatWest, the existence of new indices is likely to raise investor
consciousness about passive management techniques, in which portfolios mimic
the components of a single index.
While more than half the domestic equity funds in the US are managed in this
fashion - for far lower fees than those charged by active managers - it is
estimated that no more than 12 to 15 per cent of the UK market is managed in
this way.
The creation of a new, widely-accepted index may well encourage clients to
examine more closely the performance of market segments relative to each
other, says Mr Brown. For instance, at times of great volatility in the
FT-SE 100 index, share prices in the next 250 companies may move relatively
little.
And for the first nine months of 1992, the FT-SE 100 has produced a return
of 6.2 per cent, compared with a return of 5.6 per cent for the FT-A All
Share Index and a negative return of 9.5 per cent for the CNW Smaller
Companies Index, CNW's own proprietary index.
In explaining the disparate performances of the FT-SE 100 and the All Share
indices, fund managers point to the significance of the 10 per cent of
smaller companies in the broader index.
Mr James Woodlock, head of quantitative investment management at BZW
Investment Management, noted that the returns generated by small companies
differ by as much as 30 to 40 per cent when compared with those of large
companies. Thus, the extent to which small companies are represented in a
portfolio could significantly affect returns.
Meanwhile, the creation of the new indices is likely to spur the creation of
new retail investment products, said Mr John Clamp, chief executive of
Combined Actuarial Performance Services, which measures pension fund
returns. 'The very fact that additional indices are being created will
encourage fund managers to devise funds to track them,' he said.
But the extent to which the new indices, however effective as benchmarks,
become widely accepted by investors may well depend on the development of
hedging tools.
'These new benchmarks will be successful as and when new derivative
contracts based on them take off,' said Mr Andrew Threadgold, chief
executive of PosTel, the UK's largest pension fund and its largest
internally managed index fund.
Such derivatives are likely to be over-the-counter products developed by
individual banks, rather than exchange-traded instruments, at least in the
short term. The London International Financial Futures Exchange said
yesterday it had no plans yet to launch any futures or options contracts,
though it would watch the development of the new indices carefully.
Two factors will determine whether an active derivative market builds up
around the indices. One is the extent to which institutional investors use
the indices; if they take up the FT-SE Mid 250, for instance, then a futures
contract would provide a way of reducing or extending exposure to the sector
quickly without trading the underlying stock.
Investor interest takes time to build, though, and is not enough on its own.
The ill-fated futures contract based on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 of
continental European stocks was withdrawn after it failed to gain enough
momentum, despite the Stock Exchange's claims that the index has developed a
good following among investors.
The second ingredient is the active involvement of investment banks and
others willing to trade the contracts - for instance by arbitraging between
the futures and the underlying market. Such arbitrage in the case of stocks
outside the FT-SE 100 could prove difficult, though. The 'touch' (the
difference between the best buy and sell prices) of Mid 250 stocks is almost
double that on the FT-SE 100, reflecting the relative lack of liquidity in
these stocks.
Experience elsewhere suggests that smaller company indices, and the
derivatives based on them, pass in and out of favour very rapidly.
In the US in the first three months of 1991, for instance, small and
medium-sized stocks that were not in the S&amp;P 500 index saw a 35 per cent
price appreciation, while the larger stocks were barely breaking
double-digits.
Institutional traders, not wanting to miss the action, looked around for an
easy way to trade the smaller equities, and persuaded Standard and Poors to
construct a 'Midcap' index.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched futures on the Midcap 400 in
February, about a year after the 1991 small-stock rally began. The contract
caught the tail-end of the excitement, but volume faded along with hopes for
a strong economic recovery.
The Midcap 400 futures now trade about 525 contracts per day, and anaemic
turnover compared with the S&amp;P 500 futures' robust 57,000. At the American
Stock Exchange, where options on the Midcap are traded, volume is larger,
with daily figures hovering around 4,000 contracts.
Equity traders say the Midcap was generated by the whims of the market, and
has suffered with the overall market weakness this year. The S&amp;P 500 index
return is flat so far in 1992, and the Midcap 400 has underperformed the S&amp;P
500. 'Bottom line,' one trader says of the Midcap futures, 'this thing is
struggling, its not dead.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: Country Casuals 42% ahead and
plans to increase outlets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRY CASUALS, the wo-men's wear company that was floated on the main
market in June, increased its interim pre-tax profit by 42 per cent, from
Pounds 286,000 to Pounds 405,000.
Turnover for the six months to July 25 was down slightly at Pounds 14.8m
(Pounds 15m). Mr John Shannon, chairman, said sales were 6 per cent ahead
until May, but much less had been sold in the sale period. The aim had been
to sell as many garments as possible at full price.
Trading profit rose 22 per cent to Pounds 393,000 (Pounds 321,000). Gross
profit margin improved from 55 to 58 per cent.
The 1991 interim figures were helped by a property gain of Pounds 188,000
but hindered by interest costs of Pounds 223,000. In the latest figures,
Pounds 12,000 of interest was received.
With the help of the placing proceeds, net cash increased from Pounds 1.5m
at the year-end to Pounds 2.5m. About half the Pounds 11m raised was new
money and a chunk of that was used to redeem other forms of equity.
The rest went to the venture capital companies which backed the 1989
purchase of the company from Coats Viyella, and to directors (from the Laura
Ashley stable) who then bought into the company.
The company has 157 outlets, the majority being concessions within
department stores.
Mr Shannon said the plan was to open about 12 outlets a year, develop the
new Diffusion-Sport casual wear brand and acquire other brands. A purchase
could be expected within the next year.
The autumn range had gone well so far, with September sales 12 per cent up
on a good month last year.
The company would continue to tighten up on working capital. In the first
half Pounds 1.2m was freed from stock.
Earnings per share grew to 1.88p (1.38p). No interim dividend will be paid
on the ordinary shares, but Pounds 129,000 (Pounds 134,000) was paid out in
dividends on previous forms of equity, since redeemed.
The shares closed at 122p yesterday, against a flotation price of 130p. The
current market value of Pounds 21m compares with the Pounds 12.5m paid for
the business in 1989.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: National Power to contract out tax
work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the privatised electricity generator, has contracted out its
tax compliance work to KPMG Peat Marwick and Price Waterhouse, the
accountancy firms.
The move is the latest in a series of recent attempts by companies to
'out-source' to external consultants activities which were traditionally
considered core headquarters functions.
One of the existing six tax staff will remain to help manage the work.
KPMG will have the equivalent of four full-time staff working on UK tax
matters. PW will be working on overseas tax and on oil and gas issues.

   THE back history of the new indices
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
calculated from December 31 1985  - shows clearly the impact of investment
decisions. In the three years from 1986 to 1988, second-tier British
companies, those in the FT-SE Mid 250, significantly outperformed their
larger colleagues in the FT-SE 100.
Any investment manager who had concluded from these figures that
medium-sized companies possessed a magic all their own would have been sadly
disappointed, however. From 1989 to 1991, the trend was reversed the FT-SE
Mid 250 doing much worse than the FT-SE 100.
In 1989, the year in which this effect was most marked, there was a ten
percentage points difference between the performance of a portfolio invested
solely in mid-sized companies and one invested in the top 100. In the first
six months of 1992, the pendulum has swung back again.
Size may be one cause of this switchback. Medium-sized companies have proved
less capable of withstanding recessionary pressures than larger, more
strongly capitalised rivals.
A more important factor, however, is likely to have been the much greater
reliance by the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks on the UK economy, where the recession
has been particularly severe by international standards. Many stocks in the
FT-SE 100 obtain the great bulk of their revenues abroad, the businesses in
the second tier are focused closer to home.

FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Galliford halved as margins decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTON MORAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP decline in margins in a depressed construction market and reduced
interest income halved pre-tax profit at Galliford in the year to June 30.
Pre-tax profit at the Leicestershire-based group, which is involved in
construction, specialist contracting and housing, fell to Pounds 3.03m
(Pounds 6.39m) on reduced turnover of Pounds 213m (Pounds 225m).
Interest income fell to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 1.5m) after Pounds 6m cash
was used to finance the debt of its joint-venture partner that went into
liquidation in March 1991.
The directors decided last year to acquire the outstanding 50 per cent
shareholding and a Pounds 2.18m exceptional charge had been provided for. A
reduced exceptional charge of Pounds 703,000 this time resulted mainly from
redundancies.
Mr Peter Galliford, the chairman, said that with tender margins in the
construction sector under severe pressure on reduced volume of work
available, the group had concentrated activity in the less depressed sectors
of social housing and water.
Profit in the construction division plunged to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 4.73m)
on turnover of Pounds 129m (Pounds 135m), reflecting the sharp competition
in the open tender market.
Private housebuilding remained static at Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.9m) on
increased turnover of Pounds 8.78m (Pounds 7.89m). Completions were up 11
per cent on the previous year,
Losses deepened in the material supplies and distribution division to Pounds
931,000 (Pounds 229,000) in difficult trading conditions.
Improved profits from the specialist contracting division to Pounds 393,000
(Pounds 55,000) resulted from pipeline services and tiling although reduced
piling demand caused losses at rock and alluvium.
Earnings per share fell 48 per cent to 2.37p (4.57p).
The dividend for the year is maintained at 4.3p with an unchanged final of
3.35p.

FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Interim cut to 1p at Higgs &amp; Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Higgs &amp; Hill, the construction, housebuilding and
property group, slid from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 673,000 in the first half
of 1992, writes Andrew Taylor.
The fall would have been less but for an increase in exceptional items from
Pounds 592,000 to Pounds 872,000 to finance redundancy payments.
Reflecting the difficult trading conditions, the interim dividend is cut
from 6p to 1p.
Mr John Theakston, chief executive, said the workforce had been reduced by
45 per cent over two years reflecting the decline in core markets of
contracting, housing and commercial property development.
He warned that the outlook for next year for contracting and commercial
property looked little better, although there were some hopes that the
housing market might start to pick up
Turnover dropped from Pounds 190.9m to Pounds 149.6m. Earnings per share
after exceptional items fell from 1.7p to 1p.
Contracting incurred a small loss, reflecting lower margins on contracts as
the construction market had shrunk and competition had increased. Forward
order book stood at just Pounds 145m at end-September.
The loss was offset by the sale of an office development west of Paris,
while UK housing profits were boosted by the disposal of a site at Stevenage
Mr Theakston said the housing market continued to deteriorate despite a rise
in the number of homes sold
COMMENT
Higgs &amp; Hill in terms of its balance sheet has done well to limit the damage
in the worst downturn construction and property markets have seen for at
least half a century. Gearing is less than 10 per cent, which many
contractors will envy. The group, also, is making all the right noises about
running its businesses for cash, reducing capital employed in housing and
curtailing further property developments in France, Spain and the UK.
Contracting traditionally weighted toward private sector commercial
development, looks vulnerable, however. Commercial development is expected
to be one of the last sectors to recover. Margins currently are paper thin
to non-existent. The housebuilding operations, which can expect to benefit
first from any recovery, are small by comparison. The shares until prospects
improve are unlikely to attract many buyers.

FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Branson and James seek Dan-Air rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways, and Mr David James,
chairman of Davies &amp; Newman, are meeting today to try to thrash out a deal
to secure the future of the Dan-Air airline.
It is nearly two weeks since Davies &amp; Newman's shares were suspended at 23p
as talks intensified.
The negotiations cover marketing and operational links between the two
airlines, the possibility of Mr Branson investing Pounds 10m and the Virgin
name being put to a revamped airline.
Mr James would then use Branson's involvement to sweeten the pill of another
share issue. Last year institutional investors, many new to the company,
coughed up Pounds 49.3m.
As Mr Branson's advisers have studied Davies &amp; Newman's books, the
impression has leaked of figures which seem rather bleaker than was expected
initially.
One analyst's estimate that this year's pre-tax losses would be Pounds 10m
has been described as much too low, with speculation that the figure could
be three times as much. As Davies &amp; Newman is due to announce its first-half
results shortly, it is refusing to comment.
The options emerging from the Branson talks include:
For Davies &amp; Newman to stick to its original strategy of building up the
Gatwick-based scheduled operation, enhanced by the Branson link. Another
injection of institutional cash enables it to trade through the recessionary
period.
The question is whether Mr Branson believes the present set-up to be viable
and whether the banks and investors will be prepared to give further
financial support.
A salvage operation takes place, with both charter and scheduled operations
pruned back to a profitable core.
The Virgin name might be put to this and institutional funds sought for the
relaunch.
Mr Branson walks away and Mr James seeks another partner to help the
original plan reach fruition.
All plans fail and the company goes into administration or receivership.
This is being dismissed by the Davies &amp; Newman camp.
Mr Branson, in New York yesterday to launch Virgin's US frequent flier
programme, said he expects negotiations with Dan Air to come to a head in
the next 24 hours.
'If we were to do anything with Dan Air, it would be entirely separate from
Virgin at first' he said.

FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Tilbury Douglas stable at Pounds 7m aided
by acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TILBURY DOUGLAS, which is moving up rapidly to join the ranks of large UK
contractors, increased first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.66m to
Pounds 6.98m, writes Andrew Taylor.
They would have been lower than last year but for the inclusion of the
former Robert M Douglas businesses, acquired in September 1991, for Pounds
85.3m in shares.
Earnings per share, on the increased capital, fell from 23.2p to 13.9p. The
interim dividend is again 10.5p.
Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said the group had embarked on a series
of cost cutting exercises, 'recognising that any industry wide recovery is
unlikely in the near future.'
About 500 jobs had gone following the merger, reducing the labour force to
4,000. Some Pounds 1m had been taken out of the ready-mixed concrete and
form work division, mainly through redundancies.
The balance sheet, however, remained extremely strong. At the end of June
net cash was Pounds 4.8m.
Contracting, the biggest division, had benefited from its specialist water,
pipework and heavy electrical expertise, which had continued to perform well
despite the big downturn in UK construction work.
'It is very difficult for companies which have no experience to break into
these specialist markets and margins, although under pressure, have held up
better than for general contracting,' said Mr Bottjer.
Property, he said, had just about broke even and would have incurred a loss
but for the Scottish housebuilding operations, which had underpinned the
divisions relatively small operation in the depressed English market.
Ready mixed concrete and form work would also have been in loss if the group
had not moved swiftly to reduce overheads.
COMMENT
Tilbury's strengths are its balance sheet and mix of specialist contracting
skills which should continue to underpin in recession. Demand for
construction from water companies and process plant businesses, such as the
petroleum and pharmaceutical industries, have held up far better than other
areas of contracting. The mechanical and electrical business similarly has
benefited in demand from the recently privatised electricity supply
companies and from British Rail, which is in the process of upgrading
signalling in the wake of recent rail accidents. Nonetheless, the company is
not immune from the construction decline although profits should beat last
year's Pounds 15m. The attractions of Tilbury are already in the price.

FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ibstock Johnsen cuts payment to 0.5p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBSTOCK JOHNSEN, one of Britain's few remaining independent brick
manufacturers, has joined the growing ranks of building material producers
and contractors to cut dividends.
The company, like many others in the recession-hit sector, made a rights
call in spring last year and raised Pounds 44m at 90p a share.
Yesterday, the shares fell a further 4p to 45p after the company announced
it was reducing its interim dividend from 2.25p to just 0.5p.
It had been hit by the big fall in housebuilding and commercial property
development, both heavy users of bricks.
Pre-tax profits during the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 7.2m to
Pounds 3.1m. Earnings per share declined from 1.97p to 0.76p leaving the
much reduced dividend comfortably covered.
Profits would have been even lower but for a rise of almost Pounds 600,000
to Pounds 857,000 in interest receivable following the rights issue.
Trading prospects continued to look bleak. Mr Paul Hyde-Thomson, who retires
as chairman at the end of this year, said that there was still substantial
over-capacity in the UK bricks industry while its main markets remained
extremely depressed.
More than 1.4bn unsold bricks, equivalent to six months' supply and enough
to build 170,000 homes, were stockpiled by British manufacturers at the end
of July.
Tarmac, Blockley and Redland recently had announced plans for reducing
capacity. Despite this, UK sales were still running at about 75 per cent of
the industry's production capacity.
Brick prices had fallen sharply as a consequence, said Mr Hyde-Thomson.
Profits before interest from Ibstock's UK building products division fell by
Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.7m even though volume sales were broadly similar to
the first half of 1991.
Its US operations were in the north east of the country which had been hit
hard by a recession in housebuilding and commercial property development,
and had been very slow to recover. First half there rose from Pounds 796,000
to Pounds 1.08m.
Profits also dipped from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 1.02m in the continental
European building products market where Ibstock had tile and sanitary-ware
operations.
Forestry products, which earlier in the recession had provided a shelter
against a downturn in UK and US construction, made slightly reduced loss of
Pounds 409,000 (Pounds 586,000) with the pulp and paper industry at a low
ebb.
COMMENT
Ibstock can be excused for feeling besieged. Every market in which it
operates is in recession with little prospect for significant recovery for
another 12 to 18 months. The biggest problem is over-capacity in the UK
brick industry where more plant closures and job losses are inevitable. On
the plus side Ibstock has a gearing of only 12 per cent despite increased
investment in cheaper production; unfortunately, it may not feel the benefit
of its spending for some time. In the US, recovery in construction has been
slow and patchy and still has to take off in the north east. Total dividends
this year, at best, may be no more than 1p on pre-tax profits Pounds
4m-Pounds 5m. The possibility of a merger may help underpin the shares -
Tarmac is known to have looked at the possibility - but the company is
likely to attract few supporters until the industry's general problems can
be resolved.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance merge Australian operations
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Insurance, and Sun Alliance, two of the UK's biggest composite
(general and life) insurers are to merge their non-life insurance operations
in Australia.
The merged company, which will be 60 per cent owned by Sun Alliance, will be
the fourth largest general insurer in Australia, with premium income of more
than ADollars 500m (Pounds 200m) and a market share of more than 6 per cent.
Mr John Mallick, managing director of the new merged company, Sun Alliance
and Royal Insurance Australia, said the merger would strengthen the
competitive position of both parent companies.
Sun Alliance, the larger of the two, was previously ranked number 11 among
general insurers.
'I believe there is going to be a lot more rationalisation in the market
because there is far too much capacity,' he said. 'The big companies are
saying it is time they had better market share.' He added that the
businesses were 'very compatible'.
Sun Alliance is particularly strong in New South Wales, while Royal has a
larger market share in Victoria. As part of the merger Royal will take out
Pounds 50m from its Australian operation. The money will help strengthen
operations elsewhere.
The merger follows the acquisition of Australian Eagle by QBE Insurance, the
purchase of 75 per cent of GRE by Zurich Australian, and the merger of the
recently privatised New South Wales GIO with the Melbourne-based SIO, owned
by the state government of Victoria.
The merger will help reduce pressure on other large insurers, notably Mr
Rodney Adler's FAI Insurances, which recently reported a net loss of
ADollars 49m for the year to June. Mr Adler said the market remained 'very
difficult' because of 'generally insufficient' premium rates. GIO, which
reported net profits of ADollars 117m for the year, also said the outlook
was 'difficult'.
Sun Alliance said the merger would not affect the life businesses of the
parent companies, which will continue to operate independently. About 1,000
staff will be transferred to the merged company and 200 are expected to be
made redundant.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Hongkong Land to fall short of Trafalgar target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Land is expected to fall far short of the 29.9 per cent stake it
hoped to acquire in Trafalgar House, the property, construction and
engineering group, when it announces the result of its tender offer later
today.
Four of Trafalgar's biggest institutional shareholders yesterday said they
had decided not to sell any more shares; a further two said they were
unlikely to sell; while one confirmed that it sold its stake last week.
Hongkong Land, one of the colony's leading property investment and
development companies, has acquired 14.9 per cent of Trafalgar and is
tendering for another 15 per cent. It has until 4.30pm today to increase its
stake to 29.9 per cent.
Trafalgar's ordinary and A shares yesterday closed at 86 1/2 p and 83 1/2 p
respectively - above Hongkong Land's offer price of 85p per ordinary share
and 82p per A share.
The group yesterday said that its board would discuss the succession to Sir
Nigel Broackes, chairman, and Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, soon after
the close of today's tender offer.
While the board has not yet discussed possible replacements, Trafalgar
confirmed that Mr Allan Gormly, head of the group's engineering division, is
the favourite to replace Sir Eric as chief executive.
The move is designed to assure shareholders that the group's strategy and
management was already changing before Hongkong Land launched its attempt to
control 29.9 per cent of the group.
In a circular to shareholders earlier this week, Sir Nigel said the group
has been 'considering for some time management succession plans for senior
positions in the company'.
This would be in addition to the appointment of extra non-executive
directors.
The performance of Sir Nigel and Sir Eric has recently been criticised by
some of the group's institutional shareholders.
One shareholder said it believed that Hongkong Land was hoping to get at
least another 5.1 per cent of the stock to get it over the psychological 20
per cent barrier.
However, according to some of Trafalgar's biggest shareholders Hongkong Land
faces an uphill struggle to achieve its objectives.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Marriott acts smart to grow in lean times: Nikki Tait and
Michael Skapinker explain the worldwide implications of a decision by the US
hotel operating group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few companies have better illustrated the change from 1980s riches to 1990s
rags than Marriott Corporation, one of the largest US hotel operators. For
much of the 1980s, the group powered ahead, posting annual earnings gains
that were usually in the high teens and sometimes more than 20 per cent.
However last year the group made an after-tax profit of only Dollars 82m
(Pounds 48m) compared with more than Dollars 232m in 1988.
Marriott's announcement this week that it is splitting its hotel management
operations and property assets into two separately quoted companies is an
attempt to find a way to expand in straitened times. It has implications for
hotel companies worldwide.
In the US, hotel companies have traditionally found investors to buy
properties which the hoteliers could then run. In Europe, hotel groups have
tended to own or lease properties themselves. The downturn in the US and UK
property markets and tax changes in the US have made both strategies less
attractive.
During the 1980s, Marriott effectively became a property development
company, building hotels, then recovering its investment by selling these to
limited partnerships which used the start-up losses as a tax write-off.
Marriott retained operating control of the new hotel assets.
Today, the group operates more than 700 hotels or motels, from luxury
properties to the budget Fairfield Inn chain. That compares with less than
100 properties in the early 1980s.
Unfortunately for Marriott, a change in US tax law curtailed the use of such
development financing methods in the late 1980s. Then as the decade turned,
the good times halted decisively when the US property market collapsed.
Marriott shares slumped from more than Dollars 40 in 1989, to less than
Dollars 9 in 1990. At one stage, a serious financial threat overshadowed the
group.
Since then, Marriott has struggled to become a more conservative company in
the face of a hotel market laden with overcapacity. The company suspended
new hotel building in 1990 and shed non-core assets, such as airline
catering and its fast food and restaurants business.
Marriott's rebirth has not been made easier by the dearth of buyers for
hotel property assets; by a long-term debt burden which still amounts to
almost Dollars 3bn; nor by the general economic recession which has
curtailed business travel and holiday spending and has led to cut-throat
competition in the travel industry.
Against this background, it is easy to understand why Wall Street should
have welcomed the demerger plan, marking the shares almost 9 per cent
higher. In essence, the scheme will place the Dollars 3bn long-term debt,
most of the property assets, and the group's airport and toll road
concessions in one quoted company, Host Marriott. A second, separate company
 -called Marriott International - will contain the hotel management
operations.
In the short term, the latter is clearly a more attractive creature.
Marriott argues that there are 'properties available for management at
substantially less than it costs to build'. Marriott International, with pro
forma sales of Dollars 7.4bn last year and operating cash flow of nearly
Dollars 500m, should be well placed to expand. A lightly leveraged business
with solid profits, it should have fairly easy access to credit markets if
it needs to raise more capital. As Ms Margo Vignola at Salomon Brothers in
New York says: 'In this way, Marriott International could take advantage of
domestic and global opportunities without the hobbling overhang of real
estate and its cost.' The difficulty is that if hotel groups do not wish to
buy property themselves, they need to find someone else who will do so and
award them the contract to run the establishments.
Mr Paul Slattery of Kleinwort Benson in London says: 'I can't identify at
the moment any significant appetite for people to own the properties. I
can't tell you of any major institution that wants to go into hotel
ownership.'
Hotel groups refuse to accept that the situation is so dire. Mr Michael
Hirst, chairman of Hilton International, owned by Ladbroke of the UK, argues
that hotels, which still have a reasonable level of occupancy, are a better
bet for property investors than office blocks, which are standing empty, or
shopping malls.
Mr Hirst says Hilton believes there is scope to expand through a variety of
means. 'We adopt a very flexible approach,' he says. Of its 157 hotels, 92
are wholly owned or leased. It has contracts to operate 50 hotels on behalf
of owners. In the case of 15 hotels, Hilton has partial ownership. Mr Hirst
says: 'There are management contracts available in Europe if you're prepared
to take some equity investment.'
Late last year Hilton bought the Dom Hotel in east Berlin, now the Berlin
Hilton. A month later, it sold a 60 per cent stake to an unnamed buyer and
retained the management contract. Hilton has acquired long-term leases on
hotels in Weimar and Dresden, offering the owners payments, tied to business
performance, in addition to the rent.
Mr Slattery says US-owned hotel companies will find the idea of taking even
partial stakes in the properties they manage unattractive, because of less
favourable US tax regulations.
Some hotel groups believe the way ahead is to find franchisees willing to
use their brands and pay franchise fees without demanding property
investment. Marriott this year saw its name on 15 UK hotels thanks to a
franchise agreement with Scott's Hospitality, a Canadian company, which owns
and manages them.
Holiday Inn, owned by Bass of the UK, says 85 per cent of the 1,700 hotels
that bear its name are run by franchisees. Mr Hamish Swan, vice-chairman,
says that persuading hotels to conclude franchise agreements will be its
primary route to European growth. There are, he argues, a large number of
privately held or family owned European hotels that would want to adopt an
internationally known brand and gain access to Holiday Inn's worldwide
reservation system.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Indian brewer set to enter UK via Wiltshire takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR VIJAY Mallya, one of India's largest distillers and brewers, is set to
attempt an assault on the UK drinks distribution market via a takeover of
Wiltshire Brewery, the UK quoted drinks company.
Shares in the ailing west of England brewery, which has struggled to make a
profit from its Old Grumble, Stonehenge and Old Devil beers, were suspended
yesterday on the London Stock Exchange.
The takeover of Wiltshire will involve fresh equity via a share placing.
There will also be a subscription of new shares from a 'major overseas
brewing and spirits group' - believed to be Mr Mallya's family-controlled UB
Group - and possibly an injection of pubs from what Wiltshire calls a 'major
UK brewer'.
Wiltshire said yesterday that details of the deal will be announced before
October 16.
The deal would bring together one of the UK's smallest brewers, chaired by
Mr Graham Axford, a former managing director of corporate finance at James
Capel, and Mr Mallya, the subcontinent's biggest force in the drinks market.
UB imports and distributes Kingfisher beer to off-licences and Indian
restaurants throughout the country. It also has a joint venture with
Kent-based Shepherd Neame.
In India, however, UB - formally United Breweries of India - has expanded
beyond its brewing roots into a multinational conglomerate with interests in
distilling, petrochemical and engineering.
Mr Mallya is interested in using the Wiltshire vehicle to sell large volumes
of white spirits such as rum, gin and vodka to UK pubs.
In spite of winning a number of good beer awards, Wiltshire has been
loss-making for most of the seven years since it was bought out of
receivership in 1985.
Shareholders have yet to see their company's annual report for the 14 months
to November 1991, ostensibly the reason why the shares were suspended
yesterday.
Wiltshire went back to shareholders in 1991 - a year after joining the
Unlisted Securities Market - to finance the acquisition of pubs from Bass
soon after the government's beer orders triggered a sequence of pub swaps by
the large brewers.
Mr Mallya is likely to use the Wiltshire vehicle to develop a pub estate and
further develop his distribution company for importing products from the
group.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Southern comfort: Bill Clinton's economic policies promise a
radical break with the laissez-faire of the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's time to put people first. That is the core of my national economic
strategy for America. And that will be the fundamental idea that guides my
presidency - Bill Clinton, June 1992
The economic convictions of Governor Bill Clinton, the front-runner in the
US presidential election, are now a matter of pressing importance. Would he
make marginal changes to US economic policy or push the US in a radically
new direction?
The answer is still hotly disputed, partly because Mr Clinton's speeches are
the artful constructions of a master politician. For example, he proclaims
his commitment to free trade, yet in the same breath condemns the
Republicans for 'exporting' American jobs to the Third World. The truth
seems to be that Mr Clinton is offering a genuine break with the past. As a
conservative southerner, he has little sympathy for either old-style 'tax
and spend' liberalism or Republican laissez-faire.
President George Bush is offering the nation a watered-down version of
Reaganism. He argues that big government is part of America's economic
problem and pledges new tax cuts if re-elected. Tax cuts - particularly more
generous relief on capital gains - are sold as a way to stimulate more
saving and investment, thus boosting growth and helping reduce the budget
deficit.
For Mr Clinton, this is the failed policy of 'trickle-down' economics. He
argues that rich individuals failed to invest or save in the 1980s despite a
halving of the top rate of income tax. Instead of raising productivity
growth, supply-side economics led to a consumption binge of unprecedented
proportions. Democrats attribute the economy's inability to shake off
recession in the past two years largely to the record corporate and personal
debts accumulated during the boom years of the 1980s.
Mr Clinton offers policies based on radically different premises. From the
day he shook former president John F Kennedy's hand as a schoolboy in the
1960s, he has believed in government as a positive force in people's lives.
He believes the US is losing ground relative to Europe and Japan because
federal and state governments often do little to support economic growth.
Deliberately echoing the rhetoric of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, Mr
Clinton is offering the American people a 'new covenant' - a pledge that a
revitalised public sector will take active steps to help the forgotten mass
of middle-class American families, many of which have recently suffered a
steady erosion of living standards.
But in an era of global economic competition and unprecedented mobility of
physical and financial capital, how can government best promote high living
standards? Drawing on the ideas of advisers such as Mr Robert Reich, a
professor at the Kennedy School of Government, Mr Clinton argues that
policymakers should concern themselves with factors of production that are
immobile, principally people and infrastructure.
He makes the argument crystal clear in his economic plan, Putting People
First: 'In the emerging global economy, everything is mobile: capital,
factories, even entire industries. The only resource that's really rooted in
a nation - and the ultimate source of all its wealth - is its people. The
only way America can compete and win in the 21st century is to have the
best-educated, best-trained workforce in the world, linked together by
transport and communication networks second to none.'
The underlying logic seems persuasive. US per capita incomes once depended
purely on the performance of American companies. In a global market, they
now depend on Americans' ability to gain employment with the world's most
dynamic companies, regardless of their ultimate ownership. One route to high
US living standards is thus to persuade the most productive companies -
German and Japanese as well as American - to locate high-tech plants and
research facilities in the US. But they will do this only if the US offers a
better environment for business than other countries, which means a
better-educated workforce and a modernised public infrastructure.
On education and training, Mr Clinton's proposals move well beyond the usual
focus on high-school reforms. By proposing a national apprenticeship
programme based loosely on continental European practice, he has become the
first presidential candidate to take seriously the educational needs of the
majority of Americans who do not attend university. To help those already in
the workforce, he would oblige employers to invest about 1.5 per cent of
payroll in training or contribute to the cost of public training schemes.
The college-bound, meanwhile, would benefit from financial reforms allowing
all qualified students to borrow from the government and repay loans either
through a low tax on subsequent earnings or by serving the community for a
limited period after graduation, for example as police officers or social
workers. The bold idea of encouraging thousands of graduates to pay for
college by enlisting in a domestic 'Peace Corps' is especially appealing for
middle-class families hit by rocketing tuition costs.
On infrastructure investment, Mr Clinton's plans go beyond mundane projects
such as new bridges and roads. He favours Japanese-style bullet trains and
promises a 'communications network of high-technology interaction that will
link every home, every school, every factory, every business in America, and
put us in the lead economically well into the 21st century'.
Mr Clinton's case for more activist government has other important planks.
He sees healthcare as partly an economic issue, because soaring costs are
putting an intolerable burden on much of American business. The Republican
claim that competition can bring down costs is dismissed as yet another
failed nostrum of the 1980s. Noting that a competitive free-for-all has led
to healthcare spending equivalent to 13 per cent of gross domestic product -
easily the world's highest - Mr Clinton argues convincingly that the US must
learn lessons from other advanced countries and accept the need for sterner
government regulation, including national spending caps.
He is also openly advocating a more interventionist industrial policy,
partly to help redeploy resources devoted to defence during the cold war
years. His advisers say he is not interested in 'picking winners' but does
believe that the federal government could do more to support the development
of new 'generic' technologies in fields such as robotics, high-speed
computing and biotechnology. He would create a civilian research and devel
opment agency 'to bring together business and universities to develop
cutting-edge products and tech-nologies'.
For many economists, however, Mr Clinton's otherwise attractive plan is
flawed by a failure to address the nation's single most pressing problem:
the federal budget deficit. His promise to 'halve the deficit' by 1996
despite proposing an additional Dollars 200bn of investment in education and
infrastructure is not regarded as credible. The extra spending is not large
relative to the US budget, but it is likely to inflate the deficit because
the offsetting tax increases and spending cuts proposed are dubious. For
example, Mr Clinton has unrealistic hopes of raising about Dollars 85bn from
the top 2 per cent of earners and Dollars 45bn from foreign companies
operating in the US.
Mr Clinton's failure to propose tough fiscal measures - such as Mr Ross
Perot's bracing Dollars 160bn increase in petrol taxes and Dollars 230bn cut
in entitlement programmes - makes a mockery of his pro-growth rhetoric. The
drain on national savings from record budget deficits is arguably the single
most important cause of low investment and productivity growth. Yet what
should Mr Clinton say if he hopes to win the election? Should he make the
same mistake as Mr Walter Mondale, the Democratic candidate in 1984, and
call for a general tax increase? This would be to present himself as a lamb
for slaughter.
Given electoral realities, budget policy should perhaps not count as a clear
negative for Mr Clinton. His promise to raise federal investment without
specifying credible tax increases is no more irresponsible than Mr Bush's
pledge to cut taxes without specifying offsetting spending cuts. What he
will do if he wins the election is uncertain; if the economy is still
stagnant, he will face immediate pressure to agree a fiscal stimulus.
But there is little reason to fear he will perform worse in the medium term
than the Republicans, who have quadrupled the national debt in 12 years. He
may do better. As governor of a poor state, he is used to making hard fiscal
choices and is reputedly keener on budget balance than most of his economic
advisers. He may even take advantage of an emerging consensus in Congress on
the need for budget retrenchment finally to bring the deficit under control.
Many elements of the Clinton plan have received broad support - in normally
Republican business circles as well as in Democratic strongholds such as the
teaching profession and labour unions. People appreciate Mr Clinton's long
time horizons. In the US, economic policy debates have normally been
restricted to next year's tax and spending plans. Mr Clinton is breaking new
ground by shifting the focus to the long-term determinants of productivity
growth, such as the quality of the workforce.
The common thread linking different parts of the plan is the notion that the
US must adapt and become more like its main trading rivals, such as Germany
and Japan. It is striking that each of Mr Clinton's main reform proposals -
in education and training, infrastructure, healthcare and industrial policy
 -would push the US economy in a distinctly European direction.
Mr Clinton, in effect, is offering the American people something akin to a
Germanic social market in which free enterprise is bolstered, rather than
undermined, by strong social policies. This approach is not without risks:
greater state intervention can inhibit the ability of economies to respond
flexibly to economic shocks, which is one reason why German unification has
imposed such great strains in Europe. But it also offers the prospect of
greater social cohesion, which may be more important in the long run. Mr
Clinton's success in the polls suggests Americans are ready for what could
prove an historic change of direction.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Leading Article: France's narrow ERM options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS statements on European integration, the German government likes
habitually to repeat the words of Thomas Mann. In recent years, Bonn has
declared its aim is a 'European Germany', not a 'German Europe'.
Unfortunately, in monetary terms, the latter state of affairs, not the
former, now prevails. This has important consequences for the French
government. After the departure of Britain and Italy from the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM), the Franco-German relationship, still more clearly than
before, lies at the heart of the Continent's monetary arrangements.
Paradoxically, in view of France's much improved inflation performance,
Germany's influence in that partnership has increased disproportionately.
Re-establishing equilibrium will have a vital bearing both on the ERM's
future, and on the wider prospects for economic and monetary union (Emu).
September's currency squalls resulted, at least temporarily, in a huge shift
of European central banks' currency reserves. The four most important EC
economies after Germany - France, the UK, Italy and Spain  - lost perhaps 40
per cent of their foreign exchange holdings, while the Bundesbank's
published foreign currency reserves rose by nearly DM80bn (Pounds 32.3bn)
last month. Britain and Italy will both be mobilising large foreign loans -
Britain via the Ecu10bn facility announced in September, Italy through the
credit it is negotiating with the EC - to repay later this year at least
part of their short-term credits raised from the Bundesbank to finance
currency intervention.
Three options
In contrast to Britain and Italy, France, with the aid of the Bundesbank,
won last month's tussle to maintain its parity. But Paris has yet to show
that victory was not Pyrrhic. The Bank of France sharply ran down its
reserves, spending at least FFr80bn (Pounds 9.52bn) and possibly as much as
FFr150bn to judge by the central bank's weekly currency returns. Although
the foreign exchanges have quietened, with the franc yesterday comfortably
above its D-Mark floor, further upheavals cannot be ruled out.
The French government and the Bank of France have three basic options.
First, the French authorities can remain resolute, patient - and passive.
Further Bundesbank interest rate cuts, which now seem likely during the next
few weeks, will create room for long-promised cuts in French interest rates.
The gap between banks' base rates (held down at government behest at 9.85
per cent) and overnight money market funds (yesterday, 12.25 per cent) is
severely squeezing banks' profitability - bringing losses which largely will
have to be borne by the French Treasury. Yet, so long as the squeeze ends
soon, the government regards this as a price worth paying.
Last resort
Second, France could - as a last resort if it faces a fresh run on reserves
 -carry out a realignment to lower pressure on the franc. This not only
would bring great loss of prestige, but also would be economically
counter-productive. A revaluation of the D-Mark against the franc, when
French unit labour costs are rising much more slowly than in Germany, would
further damp German business prospects. Even if a D-Mark/franc shift were
accompanied by another Bundesbank interest rate cut, it would make a German
recession more likely.
Third, France could increase its policy credibility by adopting a more
narrow ERM fluctuation band against the D-Mark, perhaps reducing the present
2.25 per cent margin to only 1 per cent - similar to action already taken by
Belgium. This would buttress the Bundesbank's message that the franc is
correctly valued. Such a move could be combined with institutional steps
aimed at giving independence to the Bank of France. Narrower bands would
involve risks, especially in a political climate which will become more
tense during the run-up to general elections in March. But this step could
heighten the chances that France's strategic goal of Emu - inevitably,
formed around a Franco-German core - will become reality. If a European
central bank is, one day, to displace the Bundesbank from its throne, last
month's joust with the currency speculators was just one of the battles
France needs to win.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Filling in the policy gaps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR'S speech to yesterday's Tory party conference was as
economically thin as it was politically disappointing. It represented a
modest step towards formulating a workable alternative policy to membership
of the European exchange rate mechanism. But it failed to tackle the flaw
which lies at the heart of British economic policymaking.
Many aspects of the government's nascent economic policy are welcome. The
commitment to low and stable inflation, broadly defined, has been
reaffirmed; but zero inflation, a policy target that is as undesirable as it
has proved unattainable, has been forgotten. The government will monitor a
broad range of monetary and credit aggregates as well as the exchange rate;
but flexibility will prevail over any pressure to replace the exchange rate
with a single domestic policy instrument.
UK monetary policy at this point needs judgment and credibility rather than
religious attachment to a single holy policy grail. The economy needs enough
policy easing, mainly via the sterling depreciation that has already
occurred, to fuel an export and investment-led recovery. But policy must
remain tight enough to prevent a consumer-led recovery or a rise in domestic
wage inflation. No one knows how much easing of policy has already occurred.
Much more work is required before the government can claim to have
constructed a workable framework in which these judgments can credibly be
made. Operationally, there is a need for more technical meat to be put on
these monetary bones.
Wage restraint
First, the competitiveness gains of devaluation will only be maintained if
nominal wages in the domestic economy grow at a sustainable pace. They
cannot be permitted to rise by more than 4 per cent a year, which means pay
settlements of no more than 2 per cent in both the private and public
sectors. If they do, the authorities may need to tighten policy. Even after
two years of recession, average earnings are still rising at 6 per cent a
year.
Second, the government must pay close attention to the gap between long-term
interest rates and index-linked gilts, the best available market measure of
expected inflation. This gap is high and rising; at more than 5 1/2
percentage points, it suggests that inflationary expectations are rising.
There should be no further interest rate cuts until this yield gap and wage
settlements are falling again.
These extra targets are necessary if the current economic policy vacuum is
to be filled. But they will still leave a gaping credibility gap in UK
monetary policy.
Carte blanche
The case for ERM membership was that it offered a check on the freedom of
action of the chancellor and his Treasury team, deemed necessary after the
errors of the late 1980s. The ERM proved too demanding a discipline for the
economy to handle. But simply to return the freedom to set policy to those
from whom it was taken solves nothing. The chancellor's underlying inflation
target range of 1 to 4 per cent during this parliament sounds sensible, even
ambitious. But the long lags between action and result in monetary
policymaking mean, in effect, that the chancellor has awarded himself carte
blanche to do almost anything he wants.
A flexible and credible UK monetary policy can only work if it is managed by
individuals within an institution whose goals and judgment are skilfully
explained and can be understood, believed and trusted - by the markets, by
wage and price setters, and by the electorate. Mr Lamont, his advisers and
the Treasury as an institution have forfeited that trust. They will not
easily regain it.
In spite of the pain of the recession, the UK is still capable of achieving
a new consensus about the need to provide low and stable inflation. But to
do so, it will need a new institutional framework in which these goals can
credibly be pursued. The power to make monetary policy decision must be
taken from the Treasury and given to an autonomous, but accountable, Bank of
England whose tasks are simple, explicit and free from the pressures of
party conferences. And the government needs a council of economic advisers
to monitor its actions and those of the Bank. The government continues to
fall short of what the crisis demands.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Lamont's guiding star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We now know the British government's economic policy. Every morning the
chancellor of the exchequer will read the newspapers, check the markets,
lick his finger and put it up to the wind, tap, perhaps, at a lightly boiled
egg, and decide what to do. He may, of course, take advice. He will be able
to draw upon the distilled wisdom of the economists, forecasters and
officials who got us where we are today.
He will not be entirely rudderless. He has chosen a guiding star. Over the
next four or five years underlying inflation will be kept down to between 1
and 4 per cent. This is a firm objective, to be met with determination,
unless it suits the government to break it. Since the experience of the past
few weeks teaches us that events control the chancellor, and not the other
way around, the meaningfulness of this aspiration is elusive.
I summarise, but in the two paragraphs above you have the essence of Mr
Norman Lamont's speech to the Conservative party conference. The
technicalities of what he had to say were set out in a letter to the
Treasury and civil service committee of the Commons. The speech plus the
letter appear to have been received with some bemusement by the markets. The
address itself was greeted with less than rapturous applause by the
assembled Tories at their convention in Brighton. This is hardly surprising.
Most of the Tory party workers are aware that the devaluation of the pound
will work its way through to inflation. Some appreciate that there is a
political limit to the amount of deflation that the public will stand. The
conclusion is inescapable. Decisions well within the government's control
may lead it to abandon Mr Lamont's guiding star. Politics could yet drive
the Tories to cut and run.
I do not wish to be unfair to the chancellor. He has been consistent in his
determination to reduce inflation. While Britain was inside the exchange
rate mechanism his policy in that respect succeeded remarkably well. It is
wholly characteristic of him to indicate that he wishes to persevere now
that the foundations of his previous strategy have crumbled. It is, equally,
in character for the prime minister to encourage Mr Lamont. Both are aware
that to reduce interest rates rapidly, as called for by some at the
conference, would constitute a hugely expensive purchase of short-lived
popularity. It is to their credit that they have not succumbed to that
temptation.
All of this would be more enthusiastically received if the government was
politically secure, or if the chancellor had a bottomless fund of
credibility upon which to draw. Unfortunately neither condition prevails.
The government has yet to regain its authority. Mr Lamont's political
difficulties diminish his effectiveness. He may win through, and surprise
many of his detractors, but he has a way to go.
He is fighting to rebuild his reputation, with the zest and energy of a
cornered politician. A series of four long-standing public engagements could
make or break him. Success at all four would go a long way towards restoring
his image; sustained market approval would put him on the road to
rehabilitation. The first of these appearances, at a fringe meeting on
Wednesday night, was revealing. He gave a lecture on European policy. It
stuck faithfully to the government's line, which is currently 'support
Maastricht, as amended'. Yet the tone of his remarks, well understood by his
Euro-sceptical audience, belied their content. He was saying: 'I am one of
you.' He thus exposed himself as not pure metal, but an alloy.
It was the same yesterday. He did not mention Maastricht to a conference
whose nationalists are loud and vociferous. An inattentive listener might
conclude that there was no intention to return to the ERM. In the
accompanying technical letter he set conditions for re-entry which anyone
with a knowledge of recent history would realise could be met.
As one observer, close to Mr John Major, remarked, Mr Lamont wobbles. He
does it for understandable political reasons, but it does not help the
government or the prime minister. We shall see whether the pattern is
continued when he addresses the Commons committee on Monday, or at his
Mansion House speech later on.
His colleagues will be watching closely. For the moment the inner core of
the government seems united. Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Michael
Heseltine, Mr Major and Mr Lamont are co-operating, although the first three
are Euro-enthusiasts and the latter is anxious to maintain his reputation as
a sceptic. The five sat together through Black Wednesday, their amazement
growing as Mr Lamont and his officials told them the news. The Tories' world
had fallen apart in the chancellor's hands. The foreign and home
secretaries, not to mention the president of the board of trade, may find it
uncomfortable if they are obliged to sit back as the chancellor makes all
the decisions on his own once more.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: Untidy majesty - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The policy was always that the resident orchestra at the Royal Festival
Hall, whichever it may be, would offer more adventurous programmes than were
usual in the past. Now that the London Philharmonic is installed in the
position, the programmes we are getting are certainly different, although
some logic in the way they are put together would also help.
There was no musical link between the items in Wednesday's concert. Only the
orchestra's own activities provided some connection. In its other residency
at Glyndebourne the London Philharmonic took part in some of the wind
serenades commissioned to mark the Mozart bicentenary last year. Robert
Saxton's Paraphrase on Mozart's Idomeneo was the one most obviously based on
a drama and it came over with fine dramatic punch here, conducted by Jeremy
Jackman.
From wind serenade to a capella chorus. The London Philharmonic Choir also
wanted to play its part and the next piece was Mendelssohn's Psalm 2: 'Warum
toben die Heiden', after the Saxton a very comfortable Victorian setting for
double choir, in which the chorus sounded less confident than it was to do
later.
From these two openers it would be impossible to guess the main work of the
evening: Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The orchestra come on cold for the
symphony, which was an obvious risk. The opening movement gave us a big,
romantic orchestra let loose, with roaring horns and thunderous timpani
obscuring the rest, but then clarifying what is going on in a tidy fashion
has never been among Klaus Tennstedt's primary objectives in Beethoven.
Tennstedt now looks to be one of the last purveyors of the German classics
as they used to be, grand, awesome, inspirational. Or, at least, he is one
of the last who can take the liberties with the music which that style
presupposes and make it work. No matter how extreme a pulling-around of the
tempo is dared, Tennstedt convinces the listener for that moment that the
music is being genuinely felt and communicated.
In the earlier movements spontaneity of feeling was at the expense of
symphonic logic. But the arrival of the imposing bass Rene Pape to announce
the 'Ode to Joy' dispelled any lingering doubts. The finale, well sung by
the London Philharmonic Choir and supported by the other three soloists,
Lucia Popp, Ann Murray and Anthony Rolfe Johnson, found majesty and mystery
in plenty. Tennstedt remains the London Philharmonic's trump card.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: An uneasy marriage - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not only rebuilding that is causing disruption at Glyndebourne. A
warehouse fire earlier in the year destroyed sets and props, including those
for Le nozze di Figaro, which was scheduled to be one of the operas that the
touring company would take round the country this autumn.
Evidently the plans were too far advanced to change and Glyndebourne Touring
Opera has carried on with the Mozart opera anyway. Alongside revivals of
Katya Kabanova and The Rake's Progress the company now has the novelty of a
new production of its own to mark its first ever London season. Stephen
Medcalf is the producer and John Gunter the designer of the new sets, which
immediately proclaim a distinct personality.
The curtain rises to reveal an aristocratic home of sleek modernity, almost
Scandinavian in feel, every surface white and polished, spanking clean. Even
the servants' quarters have a touch of class, as though the master of the
house felt the least he could do was to furnish his staff with
assemble-them-yourself, wall-to-wall cupboards in the latest fashion. The
countess lounges in a similarly all-white, sparsely furnished bedroom.
The most effective of the designs comes in the last act, where the
night-time comedy is played out in a pool of blue light, surrounded by
delicately abstract bushes. Unfortunately the huge mask which looms over the
scene proves to be a bad omen in more ways than one. At this late stage in
the evening the producer has decided to make a point, about reality and
charades - a shame, as the rest of the production had been fairly true to
the spirit of the opera.
The cast has been well chosen. The Count and Countess make a young and
handsome pair. As the plot starts to ignite sparks of tension between them,
it is easy to believe that this couple still feels the physical attractions
and jealousies of a marriage's early years. Ralf Lukas brings a promising
baritone voice to the Count's music and Juliet Booth is a generously-sung
Countess, though she was not entirely happy with her second aria.
The resentment felt below stairs was well caught by Nicholas Folwell's
determined Figaro and Regina Nathan's nicely-sung Susanna, though neither
has the sparkling Latin temperament that their music supposes. Julie Unwin
played a sensitive Cherubino, who knew exactly what he was doing. The moment
when he lured the Countess unwittingly into his arms was a well-judged
observation from a production that generally kept to the usual moves.
Led by Neil Jenkins's amusing Benny Hill-lookalike Don Basilio, the smaller
roles are cast from strength. The music moves briskly in the hands of Marco
Guidarini, who conducts Mozart in a recognisably Italian style, sharp and
clear, but without the ability to find give-and-take within the musical
numbers. Still, the pace on stage is not allowed to slacken. On balance the
performance is just sharp enough to make it worth investigating.
Le nozze di Figaro, Sadler's Wells, sponsored by N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Ltd.
and Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque. Four further performances in London (Box Office
071-278 8916) then touring.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: Trilby's weak hypnosis - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George du Maurier (1834-1896) published Trilby in 1894, renaming the Homburg
hat and creating the character of Svengali. Du Maurier's short book became
an early bestseller, netting him Pounds 20,000. Herbert Beerbohm Tree
adapted the novel for the stage, and at the Haymarket in 1895, Trilby
entered theatrical history. It made an awful but successful play.
Now, Shared Experience Theatre has made a bold fist of this difficult drama,
and has emerged with Trilby &amp; Svengali, a lame production of a halting play.
It visits Oxford, Southampton, Belfast, Newtown and London.
This Parisian story - drawn from du Maurier's experience in the Latin
Quarter - centres on Trilby, an artist's model, and Svengali, a mysterious
Jew with hypnotic powers. Trilby loves an English artist, Billee, but feels
the social gulf between them, and runs off. Svengali mesmerises her, teaches
her to sing as 'La Svengali'. They tour Europe triumphantly, but the
hypnosis wears off, leaving Trilby croaking in mid-performance. The final
scene, all mesmerism and tension, is worthy of John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine
Steps, but with less at stake.
This is about influence and power over others, the original modern idea of
Svengali. The model with a past and the man with a presence create an
alchemy of alteration and manipulation. Trilby &amp; Svengali should explore the
boundaries of identity and personal power, but the play never gets that
close to its own centre, never becomes intimate with itself.
However, it does suggest the almost contemporary Freudian idea of a primal
scene, with Trilby reverting to childhood after hypnosis. The action
stresses the anti-semitism of the French and English; Svengali is a Jew
given no respect: 'Why should they have so much and I have so little.'
The acting copes with the chaotic direction, and Teddy Kempner as Svengali
maintains high levels of energy and mystery. Tilly Blackwood as Trilby and
Dermot Kerrigan as Billee are convincingly drawn into his world. There is a
super vignette of a washerwoman from the versatile Mary Roscoe, and moments
of musical enlightenment from Dean Brodrick's score.
Trilby &amp; Svengali; on tour until December 12: Oxford, Southampton, Belfast,
Newtown (Wales), London (071 434 9248)

FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: Derek Walcott wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The West Indian poet and dramatist Derek Walcott has been awarded the 1992
Nobel Literature Prize.
The award is both fitting and deserved because the kind of Caribbean poetry
that Walcott's work represents has helped breathe new life into English
poetry in general, whether written in England, America or elsewhere. It has
drawn the attentions of poets and their audiences back to the fundamental
importance of the relationship between poetry, song and dance.
Walcott's most recent long poem, the epic-length Omeros (Faber, Pounds
9.99), drew together many of the themes that his work had been exploring
since the late 1940s: how to reconcile the Old World and the New; the world
of European literature to which his British colonial education had given him
access, and the world of the Caribbean itself, with its dark and largely
unwritten history of slavery.
Walcott's work can be as erudite and intellectually taxing as any other
poet's of our century; but it also has the rhythmic expressiveness and
joyous sensuality of a body in motion.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: Bassano honours its most famous son - Exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most Renaissance artists, like Leonardo da Vinci, only came to be named
after their home towns as a result of leaving them. Jacopo da Ponte - known
as Bassano - is the great exception. He spent most of his working life in
and around the small town of Bassano in the Veneto, apparently making the
45km trip to Venice only once. Despite that, after Titian and along with
Veronese and Tintoretto, he was one of the most influential and inventive
Venetian painters of the 16th century.
Bassano del Grappa is honouring its most famous and loyal of sons on the
400th anniversary of his death with the first monographic exhibition of the
artist since 1957. The town has even spent some L1.5bn overhauling its
museum's security, lighting and climate control systems in order to secure
substantial foreign loans. The show is co-sponsored by the Kimbell Art
Museum in Fort Worth, and a version of it, comprising fewer - and some
different - oils plus more drawings, opens in Texas in January.
The exhibition's achievements are considerable. As one might expect,
pictures have been gathered together from far-flung and unlikely corners of
the globe - from Ottowa to the Alvar Aalto Museum in Jyvaskyla. Assiduous
sleuthing has uncovered a number of previously unknown works which add to
our understanding of the artist.
Most intriguingly, however, the show is witness to the developing
sensibility of a provincial painter as sensitive as litmus paper to what he
could glean, through pictures or prints, of current artistic practice. As
this impressive display amply reveals, Bassano was fortunate enough to live
in, and to have been inspired by, a great age of Venetian painting.
We find him first in a 'Flight into Egypt', dated to 1534, a painting of
considerable nave charm. The figures moving frieze-like across the picture
plane have the monumentality of Giotto and the palette of fresco, and indeed
derive from the frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua; the Madonna and
Child come courtesy of a Titian fresco in Venice.
Within a decade, he has plunged into the maelstrom of Venetian Mannerism.
Compositions are crowded, complex and urgent, with figures boldly cropped
and foreshortened. 'The Adoration of the Magi' from Edinburgh, arguably his
masterpiece, is a virtuoso performance of arrested action, sharp-edged
clarity and harshly sumptuous Venetian colour. Drawing on the theatricality
of Pordenone and, via Schiavone, on the elongated forms of Parmigianino, he
is now bang up to date.
In many ways Bassano is a remarkable artist. Most importantly, he
established the genre of the pastoral landscape.
From the first he had favoured Biblical subjects that allowed him to paint
humble rustic folk and their animals in the landscape, often at night.
Gradually the subject of the picture slips into secondary importance, so
that in a 'Sacrifice of Noah', for example, one has to search the middle
distance for a minute Noah and his flaming altar.
It was only a short step to dispensing with religious subject-matter
altogether - and to the pioneering series of landscapes which represent the
four seasons or the four elements through the depiction of peasants at work
in the countryside. A large and broadly executed canvas of two hunting dogs,
painted for their own sake, and set against a lowering evening sky with the
imposing Monte del Grappa in the distance, is also virtually unique in
16th-century art.
As a draughtsman, Bassano is perhaps no less original. At about the same
time as Federico Barocci in Urbino, he is covering large sheets of rough
blue paper with bold figure studies in dashing combinations of coloured
chalks.
Bassano is, however, a peculiarly uneven artist. Anatomy is often weak, and
execution frequently careless. Moreover, he tends towards the formulaic. Is
this also the consequence of workshop mentality and practice? Certainly
Jacopo, both son and father of painters, clearly regarded painting as a
family business, and the family workshop's production-line continued to
churn out lamentable Jacopo pastiches well into the 17th century.
It was, however, considered perfectly acceptable for a master at the head of
a busy workshop to re-use and re-combine particularly effective figures and
motifs - the premium on originality is a prejudice of our own age. That
said, the relentlessness of the repetition does suggest a lack of
imagination or intellectual curiosity. One reclining male figure, for
instance, is variously Lazarus, St John the Baptist, a vanquished soldier,
Joseph, and any number of shepherds.
Bassano is also curiously old-fashioned. His habit of combining unrelated
Biblical events flouts pictorial credibility: we find St Jerome deep in his
books as Christ on the Cross behind him gushes blood and the Marys weep. St
Anthony Abbot similarly fails to notice the commotion beside him as the
mounted St Martin slices his cloak in half in order to share it with the
beggar.
The museum's third gallery reveals the malign influence of his son Francesco
who has a penchant for the sootiest of night scenes implausibly stuffed with
chaotic mounds of copper pots and pans. It is hard not to heave a sigh of
great relief when Francesco decides to move to Venice in 1579.
Thereafter, Jacopo seems to have recaptured the spark that animated the
paintings of the '40s and '50s. His last religious works are indisputably
his most powerful. In an almost monochromatic, torchlit 'Christ Crowned with
Thorns', the rapidly executed figures of the suffering Christ and his
tormentors barely emerge out of an oppressive darkness. The picture has a
ghostliness and a profundity which echo the late works of his most enduring
influence, Titian.
'Jacopo Bassano' continues at the Museo Civico, Bassano del Grappa, until
December 6, and shows at the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas, January
23-April 25. Italian and English editions of the catalogue are published by
Nuova Alfa Editoriale.

An odiously sycophantic book on royal gardens - the present royals, that is
 -landed on my desk only last month and I binned it in disgust. In Royal
Gardens (BBC2, 8.30) Sir Roy Strong, art-historian and topiarist, takes an
historical journey through the gardens of the British royalty - Dutch too,
since tonight's opening programme includes Dutch William's wonderful garden
at Het Loo.
Not the least interesting thing over the next six weeks will be to see
whether Strong manages to tread royal turf and sniff regal lilies without
turning into a fawning nincompoop.
I Renounce War (9.30) continues BBC 2's series, 'War and Peace' with a
portrayal of the changing status of the pacifist in wartime since 1916 when
the Military Service Act introduced a conscience clause. One of the last
surviving conscientious objectors from the Great War describes his
experience of spending most of it in solitary confinement in Wormwood
Scrubs.
While we wait for the Bush-Clinton dialogues, BBC2 starts the ball rolling
with Campaign (11.15), a weekly series presenting the best and the worst of
the US election campaign coverage.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Management: Out to lunch but only when the in-tray is empty
 -Louise Kehoe concludes the series on power entertaining / Silicon Valley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Silicon Valley the first question is: 'Do you do lunch?' Note that there
is no mention of eating. Doing lunch means meeting people in a restaurant at
or before the noon hour. Food plays a secondary role.
The most common response is negative. 'I try to avoid it,' says Mathew
Schmitt, a public relations specialist. 'It is just not very productive in
my experience.' His view is widely shared among 'the Valley's' high-tech
types. If you accept the premise that California is a trend setter, the
business lunch is on the way out.
So too, it appears, is the 'power breakfast', one of the region's most
unfortunate innovations. Business breakfasts are still marginally more
popular than lunch. But whereas a couple of years ago it was common to
receive invitations to meet at 7.30am over bran muffins and coffee, today
most high-tech types prefer to head straight for the office and conduct a
conversation by phone.
The prevailing view is that if you have time to go out to lunch, you
probably are not working hard enough, or you don't have enough important
work to do.
Many simply regard 'off-site' lunches as an interruption, to be tolerated
only when it is expected of them by important foreign, or East Coast,
visitors.
Yet throughout Silicon Valley, 'working lunches' are the norm, whether for
members of a company team or as an opportunity to talk business with
potential partners.
These meals are usually catered and range from the casual 'box lunch' - a
sandwich, fruit salad and a cookie - to a more substantial buffet meal with
perhaps chicken and wild rice, fruit salad, always cookies, and soda or
coffee.
Senior managers, especially, prefer to 'eat in', but visitors should not
expect a plush executive dining room. Your host may even skip the food in
his enthusiasm for describing the latest technological wizardry and
fingering the flip charts.
Intel executives like to show off the company's new headquarters cafeteria,
open from 6.30 to 8.30 for breakfast and again at lunch time. At Sun
Microsystems you can expect a can of Diet Coke (no glass) and a salad served
at the executive's desk. Hewlett-Packard provides a nice spread of
'make-your-own sandwich' ingredients.
When they do venture beyond their office buildings, Silicon Valley types
choose 'California cuisine' - lots of imaginative salads, crispy vegetables,
chicken or fish with hardly any red meat in sight. Everything, it seems, is
served with sun-dried tomatoes.
One such eatery that is a
favourite with Apple Computer employees is 'Sport City' in Cupertino, where
the staples are salad with iced tea or lemonade. After work they may return
for a glass of chardonnay, but heavy drinking is definitely not fashionable.
You have not really 'arrived' in Silicon Valley, however, until you have
partaken of the offerings of a 'roach coach', one of the silver-sided vans
that make daily tours of office parks selling suspect burritos,
heart-clogging hot dogs and slightly stale sandwiches to hungry inmates.
This is where you will find the founders of fledgling Silicon Valley
start-up ventures. The challenge is to figure out which ones among them will
eventually be building company canteens.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Management: High time to turn round R&amp;D - Sterling's
devaluation provides UK manufacturers with a golden opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the tidal wave of commentary about the state of British manufacturing
industry following sterling's devaluation, one issue has gone virtually
unmentioned: the sudden scope which now exists for increased profits to be
used on the development of new and improved products, and also - though less
immediately vital - on research.
A sharp surge in the rate of product innovation has not only been made
possible by devaluation; it is desperately needed if Britain is ever to have
any hope of closing its yawning trade gap. It will prove a vital competitive
weapon even if the recession continues for another five years.
As every commentator has recognised, sterling's devaluation will bring a
number of short-term benefits to British exporters, including increased
profits.
The stock market's delirious initial reaction to devaluation three weeks ago
was powered heavily by the expectation that profit rises would be used to
boost dividends - as well as by the hope of further share price gains to
come.
Beyond that, most economists and other commentators have argued merely that
higher profits will enable hard-pressed companies to cut their debt and
strengthen their balance sheets.
There has been some talk of higher investment, but always with the apparent
implication that this will be in the form either of acquisitions - like
Hanson's bid this week for Ranks Hovis McDougall - or of spending on plant
and equipment. The latter is an unlikely option for many companies so long
as they can see no end to their current overcapacity.
Which is why a surge in the rate of relatively short-run development ('D') -
as distinct from riskier, longer-term research ('R') - is now not only
possible, but doubly necessary. Pitched carefully, a modest investment in
the right sort of product and process improvement can bring a positive
return in just two or three years.
Failure to make that investment can consign one's existing product to
near-oblivion.
Back in the slump years of the 1930s, this lesson was learned to great
effect by a few manufacturers, especially in America - which was partly why
the industrial design profession had its first real flowering there at that
time.
Wise manufacturers try to work this trick with everything - including
expensive items such as cars. In a desperate attempt to recapture lost sales
and profits, Ford of Europe is now in the process of launching an improved
version of its lacklustre Escort model only two years after its initial
launch; it has been 're-skinned', and otherwise improved, by its industrial
designers and engineers.
As the UK food and computer software industries have shown over the past few
years, an increased rate of such 'incremental innovation', to use the
technical term, can do wonders for one's market share.
In grossly saturated markets such as segments of consumer electronics, the
revamp of a product's exterior, or also of its performance, may fail to work
its magic. But such cases are the exception.
The readiness of German, and especially Japanese, industry to undertake a
steady flow of incremental product and process improvements, as opposed to
less frequent and much riskier big leaps forward, is one of the reasons for
those countries' industrial success in the past 20 years against the more
breakthrough-minded US and UK.
In the sort of consumer and industrial products at which they excel, the
Germans may not introduce improvements as often as the Japanese do in their
own areas of strength. But the Germans certainly beat the British. So, these
days, do many American companies, which are borrowing Japan's incremental
tactics for all they are worth.
A lot of this incremental expenditure falls outside OECD and other official
definitions of research and development. So Britain's poor performance in
incremental development adds an extra layer of concern to its awful standing
versus its main industrial competitors in the sort of expenditure
comparisons shown in the illustration.
Sceptical economists will argue that this article represents the ravings of
a technology freak, and adherence to the obvious fallacy that a nation's
economic strength varies in direct proportion to its expenditure on
development and research. On both counts, such criticism of the foregoing is
misplaced.
Likewise, to advocate a surge in spending on D, and possibly also on R, does
not in any way imply disagreement with critics who argue that improving the
management and productivity of both development and research, on even the
most worthwhile of projects, is more important than simply increasing the
spend.
Quality does count more than quantity, in other words. In economic jargon,
raising the outputs of development and research must be more of a priority
than raising the inputs to them.
Yet this does not mean that greater inputs are not also required, as an
economic consultant, David Sawers, suggested in the FT last month (Personal
View, Sept 2). Better output and greater input are both needed if British
companies, and the nation as a whole, are to improve their real competitive
performance.
Recent US academic and consultancy research has shown that large Japanese
companies are managing their design, development and engineering processes
much more efficiently than either their US or their European counterparts.
In America, companies are now moving fast, through various changes in
management processes, to close that productivity gap.
Yet, in spite of a sharp slide in corporate profitability in 1991, many of
the same companies are also spending more on both D and R.
Given the intense financial pressures which they feel from Wall Street these
days, few if any of them can be doing so out of blind faith. Rather, they
have learned from experience that market-driven incremental development is a
vital factor in commercial success - as, in many cases, is research.
If anyone really doubts this, they need only ask resilient US companies such
as Hewlett-Packard, Xerox and 3M, or the more mundane massed ranks of
Germany's world-beating engineering enterprises. Or, of course, Japan's
ultra-competitive car industry.
Alternatively, much closer to the home of some of the most unworldly
economists around, doubters could talk to Glaxo, ICL or even mundane old
Turner &amp; Newall (T&amp;N). In their very different industries, all three are
heavily dependent on D, R, or both.
The figures above are taken from the government-backed 1991 'UK R&amp;D
Scoreboard', produced by Company Reporting. The 1992 statistics do not
include a table of each country's Top 100 all-industry spenders, or sector
breakdowns, except for the UK.
The figures should not be read as precise to the decimal point, because of
differences in definitions between countries, and even between companies in
the same country. But the US and UK figures are based closely on the rather
narrow OECD definition of 'R&amp;D', as are those for leading German companies.
For the most part, the US and UK figures exclude government-funded research
and development.
Two things, above all, emerge from the statistics. First, the total UK
outlay on research and development is relatively low in every sector, even
those few where Britain is, or has been, supposedly strong, such as
chemicals and aerospace.
This relates to the second point: that, even in sectors where the UK's
leading companies are just as R&amp;D-intensive as their global rivals - such as
ICI in chemicals - R&amp;D intensity tails off behind them.

FT  09 OCT 92 / The Property Market: A dialogue of the deaf - Matthew
Oakeshott on the case for reforming commercial leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW OAKESHOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of Britain's biggest retailers met last week to demand changes in the
way they rent commercial property from long-term investors - pension funds,
insurance and property companies.
The retailers dislike the traditional institutional lease, under which
tenants contract to pay rent for 25 years with upward-only rent reviews
every five years, and keep the property fully repaired and insured. They
argue that the English lease structure is inflexible and unfair, rents
increase in an arbitrary way, and if they pass on ('assign') leases on
property which no longer suits them, they are liable for rent and repairs if
subsequent tenants default (the principle of privity of contract).
Weary and fearful investors, suffering the worst property crash since the
1930s, say they have heard all this before - there is always a crescendo of
tenants' screams in the depths of recession.
Certainly there was little sign of retailers wanting to reform the system
four years ago when it was working in their favour. Many were eager to take
more space, or pocket a fat premium from selling a lease on a shop where the
rent bill lagged behind the market because of the traditional review system.
Most also wanted arbitrators to settle disputed rent reviews, not
independent experts who can take a wider view of current market conditions.
Property is a cyclical business - it always has been, it always will be, and
with any conceivable legal and institutional framework the balance of
advantage between landlord and tenant will still vary over the cycle.
Long-term investors need a secure income stream to meet their liabilities. A
traditional long institutional lease to a blue-chip tenant produces ideal
top quality income.
Letting or re-letting empty property is a sideshow compared to the long-term
investment performance of the more than 90 per cent of institutions'
property assets which are safely let and which generate income. Just because
tenants can negotiate soft leases in soft markets such as London offices,
they should not expect long-term investors to concede sea-changes in the
lease structure; such concessions would devalue the bulk of their portfolios
and eliminate property as a competitor to equities and gilts for investment
funds. Unless they are offered something in return, long-term investors are
as likely to abandon the institutional lease as climbers on the North Face
of the Eiger to let go of the rope. They would be failing in their duty to
their pensioners and policyholders.
At present the operation of the market seems unfair to tenants during their
lease but equally unfair to investors when the lease ends. Under the 1954
Landlord and Tenant Act, the tenant has the investor up against a wall, with
a one-way option in his favour to renew his lease for up to 14 years at a
rent and with lease conditions fixed by a court. And it is tough under
current English law to ensure that departing tenants leave property in good
repair.
The argument between tenants and investors looks like a dialogue of the
deaf. But there is a simple solution to the strains in the system. It would
help both sides now and keep a better balance over the whole economic cycle,
as well as cutting legal costs and delays.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the basic contract for the occupation of
commercial property operates in a much fairer way than in England and Wales,
both during and at the end of a lease. Many important investors and tenants
have operated happily under the Scottish and northern Irish systems for many
years. Why not bring England and Wales into line? There are two main
differences between commercial property leases in the north and south of the
UK:
Privity of contract. Tenants in Scotland and Northern Ireland are off the
hook once their leases have been assigned but the investor's position is
protected because leases can usually be assigned only to a tenant of equal
status. If an undoubted name such as Marks and Spencer wants to move out,
prudent investors will ensure that the lease is not assigned but the shop is
sub-let to, say, Lowndes Queensway, or a Mrs Snooks (who may be a
respectable trader but would not be 'of equivalent financial standing,
demonstrably capable of fulfilling all the tenant's obligations throughout
the period of the lease', as a Scottish institutional lease may put it).
But if Mrs Snooks in Scotland or Ulster takes a lease on a small shop, and
assigns it to a Mr McHattie, she cannot be pursued for Mr McHattie's rent or
repairs years after she has retired, for example (and the present English
law can produce horrific cases). The blue chip tenant, by sub-letting rather
than assigning, can also keep a firmer grip than in England on his
liabilities arising from rent reviews and alterations, and has the right to
take back and re-let or reoccupy the property if the sub-tenant defaults on
rents or repairs.
Lease terms in Scotland mean what they say about repairs and lease length -
tenants of office and industrial property in Scotland have no right to renew
their lease, and shop tenants' rights are negligible. A 10 or 25-year lease
means just that, not a perpetual right to occupy for the tenant.
Obviously tenants in England and Wales see no advantage under the present
system in signing a long lease since they may enjoy a series of free
five-year statutory options to renew in their favour. If the Scottish system
applied to England, tenants would have to strike a balance in their lease
renewal negotiations between their wish for flexibility and security. Many
UK national retailers are still freely taking new leases and renewing leases
for 20 or 25 years in Scotland, not just because the market is healthier in
Scotland than in London, but also because long leases often make commercial
sense for both landlord and tenant under the balanced Scottish system of
lease renewals.
There is no need, anywhere in the UK, for courts to be involved, with all
the expense and delay entailed either in fixing new lease terms or in
settling dilapidations claims at the end of leases. In Scotland, if the
landlord gets his property back at the end of the lease, he repairs it
straightaway and the tenant pays. In England and Wales the process is
cumbersome, costly and slow with some big retailers rivalling Houdini in
their technique for wriggling out of repair commitments. Property often
stands empty for years while cases drag through the courts.
A shift to the Scottish system would not need immediate legislation in
England and Wales. Investors and tenants should now agree a three-point
commercial property charter for new leases (see chart).
Such a charter would give something to both sides. It would make investment
and occupation simpler and cheaper, and it would protect small traders
without undermining institutional investors' long-term security of income.
It would also reduce the swings in advantage between landlord and tenant
over the economic cycle which are inevitable in the present English system,
and end the Catch-22 of landlords and tenants never wanting the system
changed at the same time.
If this voluntary charter works well in practice, the law should then be
changed to abolish both privity of contract and the 1954 Act for all new
leases. It would, of course, be wrong to break existing lease contracts by
retrospective legislation abolishing privity of contract or a tenant's
rights to renew leases.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Bush attacks Clinton over anti-war role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush has picked up a theme previously confined to the right
wing of the Republican party and accused Mr Bill Clinton of unpatriotic
behaviour in his activities against the Vietnam war more than 20 years ago.
Mr Clinton's campaign immediately dismissed the president's charges, aired
in a television talk show appearance on Wednesday night, as 'a sad and
pathetic ploy by a desperate politician'. It claimed its overnight
'tracking' polls showed Mr Clinton's lead widening in direct relation to the
sharp negative turn of the Bush effort.
Mr Bush went so far as to suggest that a trip Mr Clinton made, early in
1970, to the then Soviet Union was somehow linked to his part in anti-war
protests while he was a student at Oxford. 'I cannot for the life of me
understand demonstrating against your own country when you are in a foreign
land,' the president declared.
He then questioned Mr Clinton's mission to the Soviet Union. 'To go to
Moscow, one year after Russia (sic) crushed Czechoslovakia, and not remember
who you saw there. . . You can remember who you saw in Oslo but you can't
remember who you saw in Moscow?'
These allegations were first raised last week in late-night speeches in the
House of Representatives by conservative Congressman Robert Dornan.
These were then picked up over the weekend on late-night radio talk shows,
one of whose hosts reported many calls on the subject from clearly
conservative listeners. The Washington Times, a Republican propaganda
conduit, has put them on the front page all week. The mainstream media,
until Mr Bush's intervention late on Wednesday, had treated them with some
disdain because of lack of substantiation.
But the Bush-Quayle campaign had chipped in with a vengeance earlier on
Wednesday. Ms Mary Matalin, its combative political director, questioned Mr
Clinton's 'blithe dismissal that there is nothing odd about a noted anti-war
activist visiting a country that was providing the weapons and know-how to
kill American soldiers in Vietnam'.
Mr Clinton's camp has drawn immediate comparisons with similar tactics used
before the British election last April, a campaign closely studied by
Republican strategists. Particular attention is drawn to articles in the
London Sunday Times last February about visits, with implied dark motives,
made by Mr Neil Kinnock, then leader of the opposition Labour party, to the
Soviet embassy in London.
The Democratic candidate has conceded that he took part in anti-war protests
in London, though he did not lead them, and that he did meet in Oslo the Rev
Richard McSorley, a prominent anti-war activist from Georgetown University
in Washington, where Mr Clinton was an undergraduate.
The Republicans think that there is more to be elicited and that Mr Clinton
can be distracted from his main message on the parlous state of the US
economy. However, all the assaults so far seem to have had minimal public
impact, at least as registered by the polls.
Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, did seem to score something of a
public hit with his half-hour, paid-for special on the economy, broadcast on
Tuesday night. Overnight ratings showed it attracted 16m viewers and,
perhaps helped by a big baseball game having preceded it, was the second
most-watched show in its time slot.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Democrat line on tax code criticised

<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAX proposals by Governor Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate,
to keep US factories in the country would further complicate the US tax code
and cause 'a terrible misdiversion of tax energy', according to Dr Gary
Clyde Hufbauer, author of a new study from the Institute of International
Economics.
He proposes restructuring the US tax system for multinationals to encourage
both exports and foreign investment in the US, and to reverse the bias
against US production of high-technology goods. He also urges co-operation
among the leading industrial countries in devising common rules on taxation
of foreign earnings.
Taxation of foreign subsidiaries in the US is a presidential campaign issue.
Mr Clinton has suggested Dollars 45bn (Pounds 25.2bn) can be raised over
four years by requiring foreign companies 'to pay their fair share'.
Legislation put to Congress this year would require a minimum tax on foreign
companies which underpay their US tax through transfer pricing.
The study concluded that the US could raise Dollars 6bn a year through
improved enforcement of transfer pricing and the use of a timely arbitration
procedure to settle disputes. Implementation of all their reforms would
yield Dollars 12.3bn annually.
In taxing multinationals, they recommended:
An end to taxing income earned by US companies from their foreign
operations, while abolishing the foreign tax credit for earnings abroad.
Increasing the Foreign Sales Corporation exemption from 15 per cent to 40
per cent. Ensuring that royalties and fees earned overseas by US companies
are taxed solely by the US at normal corporate rates. (Technology income
earned abroad is almost tax-exempt now, while technology income earned by
the same companies in the US is normally taxed at 34 per cent.)

Among the measures are a cap on interest rates of 27 per cent a year at
state banks, a reduction in employers' social security contributions, and a
further round of deregulation. Also, new tax rebates and incentives aim to
encourage exports and imports of capital goods. Initial estimates put the
cost of the package at the equivalent of more than Dollars 1.3bn a year.

THE strike by some 8,300 ground crew workers against USAir, the US airline
in which British Airways wants to invest, ended yesterday morning after a
'tenative contract agreement' between management and the International
Association of Machinists, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The IAM has indicated that it will recommend the accord to its members, said
USAir, but ratification by the rank-and-file is required.
The strike began on Monday and caused USAir to cut daily jet departures by
40 per cent. The carrier said that normal schedules should be on again by
Monday.
The three largest US airlines yesterday claimed BA's warning that US
disapproval for the USAir deal would have severe consequences for airline
deregulation was 'baseless'.

PRESIDENT Desmond Hoyte of Guyana has threatened a legal challenge to the
results of the elections on Monday which his People's National Congress
party lost to the People's Progressive party of Dr Cheddi Jagan, Canute
James reports from Georgetown.
Dr Jagan, 74, a former Marxist who now advocates a market economy, is to be
sworn in as president at the weekend. He has promised to name a cabinet
representative of both the sometimes antagonistic ethnic groups in the
country, those of Indian and African descent.
Mr Hoyte, although saying his party accepted the result for the time being,
added that it did so 'without prejudice' to its right to approach the courts
for adjudication on 'administrative and other irregularities during the
elections'.
However, foreign monitors called the poll free and fair. One of them, former
US President Jimmy Carter, said the result should be accepted by all
parties.

FT  09 OCT 92 / CBS to open up Black Rock: Alan Friedman reports on new
tenants for a New York landmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOULD William Paley, the founder of CBS Television, turn in his grave?
That is the question being whispered around the elegant, black granite
Manhattan headquarters of CBS, known affectionately as Black Rock. CBS,
which has been cutting costs under the stewardship of Mr Laurence Tisch, the
billionaire investor who controls the network, has decided to let a piece of
the rock to outside tenants.
Black Rock, set back from Sixth Avenue and distinctive for its Canadian
black granite exterior, is not merely the CBS headquarters. It is a New York
architectural landmark and is known fondly as The House That Paley Built.
The 35-storey building, which began housing CBS staff in 1964, was designed
by Eero Saarinen, the same architect who fathered both the Vivian Beaumont
theatre at New York's Lincoln Center and the unusually shaped TWA terminal
at Kennedy International Airport.
In 1988, when CBS sold its records division to Sony of Japan, the lower
floors of the building were taken over by what is now known as Sony Music.
But Sony is moving its staff to another location and eight months ago Mr
Tisch agreed to let up to 16 floors to the blue-chip Manhattan commercial
real estate firm of Edward S. Gordon.
Mr Stephen Siegel, chief executive of Gordon, said yesterday that the
architects hired to refurbish the lobby had strict instructions to do
nothing that would alter Black Rock's character. He also noted with pride
that six floors of Black Rock have already been let to Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen &amp; Katz, one of New York's leading corporate law firms. And there is
interest from MasterCard, the credit card company. Still untouched, however,
is the grand wood-panelled 35th-floor office suite that was once occupied by
Mr Paley himself.
A CBS spokeswoman, asked whether Mr Paley would turn in his grave at the
thought of outsiders coming into Black Rock, declined to answer, describing
the inquiry as 'tacky'. But the more commercially minded Mr Siegel had no
qualms responding: 'I really don't think so. I honestly believe Paley would
realise the prudence of this. The business has changed. CBS has less
personnel and less need of space. I think this is a good business decision.'

year to next March was hanging by a thread last night after employers'
leaders delivered a gloomy assessment of the economy's prospects despite the
emergency package announced in late August.
The Federation of Economic Organisations told the government it would have
to take further measures to stimulate the recovery after a survey of its
leading members found that most expected growth of 2.6 per cent this year.
Many Japanese economists, financiers and industrialists regard sustained
growth of below 3 per cent to be a 'growth recession' in an economy which in
the late 1980s was used to expansion of more than 5 per cent a year.
The employers' doubts were given added weight by a flurry of reports in
which economists reduced their forecasts for growth over the next two years
to well below the official government target.
With the initial euphoria over the August package fading, the government is
under increasing pressure to consider tax cuts next year to revitalise the
economy.
Mr Shizuka Kamei, vice-chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
policy affairs research council, renewed calls from within the party for the
government to force the Ministry of Finance to relax its opposition to
increased borrowing to finance higher public spending. Mr Kamei said there
would be a tax shortfall of Y5,000bn (Pounds 24.6bn) this year.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the Employers' Federation chairman called on the
government to introduce an additional programme to stimulate the economy
after delivering the bleak survey results to the Economic Planning Agency.
The Federation said a majority of companies welcomed the emergency Y10,700bn
package announced in August, but criticised both the government and the Bank
of Japan for acting too late to stimulate the economy.
Although most employers believed the economy would recover from next spring,
many forecast that it would then grow only slowly. Several doubted whether
the Y8,600bn public investment programme which forms the core of the special
package could be implemented by next March.
The Federation called for cuts in income and corporation taxes, a review of
land and securities taxation, looser monetary policy and an examination of
whether indirect taxes should be raised to finance tax cuts elsewhere.
The Japan Research Institute also called for a further Y4,000bn cut in
income taxes, while the Nomura Research Institute called for an additional
package of Y6,000bn.
Japan's machine tool industry is facing a severe contraction after a 45 per
cent drop in new orders in August, compared with last year.
The Machine Tool Builders Association said the fall mainly reflected a
prolonged slump in orders from the car industry, which is cutting back on
investment. Orders from the car industry fell 55.4 per cent from the year
before. The association warned that the decline in orders was likely to last
for several months as investment plans are cut back to reduce costs and
raise profitability.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Japanese 'godfather' under pressure

<TEXT>
MR Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced 'godfather' of Japanese politics, was under
increasing pressure last night from within his ruling Liberal Democratic
Party to respond to public criticism of his behaviour by making a
ritualistic show of remorse.
The ruling party has been shaken by continuing public protests and polls
reflecting deep disgust with the lenient treatment of Mr Kanemaru, who was
given a Y200,000 (Pounds 984) fine for accepting an illegal donation of
Y500m from a parcel delivery company. There is also public anger over his
apparently frequent dealings with gangster groups.
Mr Kanemaru was under attack yesterday on two fronts, from within his own
faction, the party's largest, and from other LDP factions. Seven MPs from
three different factions yesterday urged the 'godfather' to resign from the
party, while others have suggested privately that he should give up his
parliamentary seat.
Members of Mr Kanemaru's faction have been meeting over the past three days
to discuss his plight, and it is clear that senior members see the present
turmoil as an opportunity to improve their own standing and challenge Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, the former party secretary-general and Mr Kanemaru's chosen
successor.
Meanwhile, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has watched helplessly
from the sidelines. Reliant on Mr Kanemaru to raise the numbers necessary
for his appointment last year, he is unable to take action against him. Mr
Miyazawa's lack of leadership has been condemned in Japanese editorials,
while the LDP has been distracted from issues such as the ailing economy and
the troubled relationship with Russia.
When he first confessed in late August to taking the illegal funds, Mr
Kanemaru resigned as vice-president of the party and said he would resign as
chairman of the faction, which is the more powerful of the two positions.
But he has since been encouraged to keep that position for fear that his
departure would create a bitter fight for control of the faction.
However, fighting has anyway erupted within the faction, as senior officials
opposed to Mr Ozawa's 'arrogant' management style have attempted to blame
him for the problems faced by the 'godfather'. At the same time, public
demands for Mr Kanemaru's resignation have failed to dissipate.
The Mainichi Shimbun, a leading Japanese daily newspaper, has opened an
'action line' to encourage readers to complain. A 54-year-old real estate
agent warned that 'the administrators of justice, the politicians and
organised crime' have been co-operating with each other and 'we can't let
this situation continue'.
A 57-year-old housewife said she was 'disillusioned' by the handling of Mr
Kanemaru's case, and suggested the Social Democratic Party, the leading
opposition party, had been cowardly. The SDP is reluctant to get involved in
the dispute because its own members have received illegal funds from the
same parcel delivery company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin.

FT  09 OCT 92 / India unveils lending rate cut of 1 point

<TEXT>
THE Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, yesterday signalled a modest
easing of monetary policy with a 1 percentage point cut in commercial
lending rates and a relaxation of liquidity rules for banks.
Mr S Venkitaraman, the governor, said the measures were a response to
distinct signs of recovery in the Indian economy, after a sharp slowdown in
growth last year when the government introduced austerity measures to cope
with a balance of payments crisis.
But industrialists said the cut in commercial banks' minimum lending rate
from 19 per cent to 18 per cent would not be enough to revive the economy.
The Confederation of Engineering Industry had asked for a 4 point cut.
Stock investors were unaffected by the central bank's announcement and the
Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share index fell eight points to 3211.55.
Nevertheless, a leading government economist said the cuts would be 'a
modest stimulus' to industry.
Yesterday's rate cuts were the first since rates were raised to record
levels last year and follow a sharp decline in the annual inflation rate
from a peak 16.3 per cent to 8.8 per cent at the end of last month.
However, the reserve bank is adjusting its policy cautiously. While the
commercial banks' minimum lending rate is being reduced, and deposit rates
are also coming down, the central bank's bank rate, its main indicator rate,
will stay unchanged at 12 per cent.
The reserve bank also cut its statutory liquidity ratio - the proportion of
funds which commercial banks are obliged to invest in government securities.
This spring the ratio was cut to 30 per cent for new deposits from 38.5 per
cent. Following yesterday's announcement, the figure for existing deposits
will be reduced from 38.5 per cent to 37.75 per cent, in a move which will
release funds for commercial loans.
In a speech to bankers in Bombay, Mr Venkitaraman said industrial production
would probably rise by 4 to 5 per cent in the 1992-1993 financial year,
which started in April. This follows a marginal 0.1 per cent increase last
year.
Meanwhile, in a cautious move to restore life to the market in government
securities, which has been hit by a Rs35bn scandal, the central bank is
resuming the sales of government securities to banks under repurchase terms
(repos). Repo sales were stopped in May when the scandal erupted. However, a
ban on repo sales between banks, which were the occasion of regulatory
abuses, will stay in place.

AUSTRALIA'S politically sensitive unemployment rate dipped to 10.8 per cent
in September from 10.9 per cent in August, but economists said the prospects
for further reductions appeared to be slim.
Government figures showed that the reduction in unemployment was entirely
due to a fall in the number of people seeking work. The number of people
employed fell by 44,000, following a fall of 17,000 in August.
Mr Kim Beazley, employment minister, welcomed the fall and said the
underlying trend suggested that the 'shake-out' in employment was coming to
an end.
However, economists said the figures showed that Australia's recovery from
the 1990-1991 recession remained disappointingly slow.

FRENCH farmers are once more mobilising themselves to try to thwart any EC
concessions on farm trade in the negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
In the run-up to the EC's Birmingham summit on October 16 - which would have
to endorse any deal reached with the US in Brussels this weekend - they will
next Wednesday launch a 'day of action' to lobby MPs, MEPs and local
officials across the country.
But, clearly nervous about this weekend's negotiation, Mr Jean-Pierre
Soisson, France's new agriculture minister, was in Brussels last night to
stiffen EC negotiators' backbones, under orders to defend French interests.
France was taken aback by the virtual isolation of its trade minister, Mr
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, in the EC Council of Ministers earlier this week on
Gatt, and particularly by the line taken by his German counterpart, Mr
Jurgen Mollemann, that a Gatt deal was needed to calm the world's money
markets.
French officials regard it as unlikely that the Council of Ministers might
try to push a Gatt deal through by majority vote. But there is concern that
the US may have bought Germany off by accepting that the bulk of direct aid
to farmers, of prime interest to Germany's small and inefficient
agricultural sector, should be exempted from cuts.
Paris's prime concern is that this weekend should not produce an US-EC
accord on agriculture alone. This would not only further foment next
Wednesday's demonstrations. It would also, officials in Paris say, weaken
the Community's bargaining hand on other unresolved Gatt issues, in which
France has a big stake. These include:
Services. France wants to push the US harder on liberalising trade in
services. After the US, France is the second biggest exporter of services.
Subsidies. France wants the draft Gatt code on subsidies to exempt subsidies
for aircraft-making, research and development and environmental
improvements.
Intellectual property. France feels Gatt protection of marks of origin for
wine and cheese is inadequate.
Dispute settlement. Like its EC partners, France wants any strengthening of
Gatt dispute procedures to stop the US seeking unilateral redress.
For French farmers, of course, the fight with the US is on agriculture
alone. They proved their political clout by helping bring the Maastricht
treaty within a whisker of defeat in the September referendum, and the
unpopular Socialist government needs all the votes it can get in next
March's parliamentary elections.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE and US car makers have made little progress in implementing the
agreement to boost US car imports into Japan reached when President George
Bush visited Japan in January.
Toyota said yesterday it was still discussing with General Motors of the US
a plan for Toyota to import 5,000 more GM cars a year. The deal between the
two companies was the second largest component in an agreement in which five
Japanese manufacturers agreed to import an additional 20,000 US cars by
1994.
The agreement, designed to ease trade frictions, was signed by US car
industry executives who accompanied Mr Bush and was one of the most
controversial aspects of his visit.
However, there were signs yesterday of a renewal of trade friction over cars
after a lull since the start of the year.
The Japanese Automobile Association accused the US Congress of erecting a
non-tariff barrier against cars made at factories owned by foreign
manufacturers by attaching labels which identify foreign-made components.
According to the Japanese Automobile Importers Association, car imports from
the US in the first nine months of the year were up just 2,713 to 25,730.
Most of this reflected a surge in sales of the US version of Honda's Accord,
not covered by the January agreement. Sales of GM cars fell from 7,146 to
7,041 in the first nine months; Ford's rose 48 to 2,419 and Chrysler's 50 to
1,171.
Toyota, Honda and Nissan said they still planned to more than double
purchases of US-made components by 1994.

FT  09 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US eases curbs on foreign telecom carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TANGLED trade dispute between the US and the UK is expected to be resolved
as a result of a decision yesterday by the US telecommunications authorities
to ease the regulation of foreign-owned telecommunications carriers.
The decision is expected to pave the way to more competition in
international telecommunications. It could eventually lead to sharply lower
international call charges on a number of routes, including the busy US-UK
route.
The Federal Communications Commission is to relax rules automatically
treating foreign-owned carriers providing international services from the US
as 'dominant' and impose on them a heavier regulatory burden than on most
US-owned carriers.
In future, carriers will be presumed dominant only on those routes where
they are affiliated to a carrier at the other end of the route and where
that foreign carrier is a monopoly.
The relaxation followed pressure from the UK government and a petition from
Cable and Wireless, the UK-based telecommunications group, which has
operations in the US.
The UK's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) had argued that the old
rules were discriminatory and insisted that they be changed before it would
license a new form of competition, known as international simple resale,
between the UK and the US.
Resale would allow a new class of operator to lease international circuits
in bulk from established carriers such as AT&amp;T and resell services to end
customers. It is expected to put downward pressure on international call
charges, which are well above costs.
The DTI, which last month permitted resale to Australia, Canada and Sweden,
is now expected to add the much larger US market to its list of authorised
countries. Last night it said it was 'very pleased' with the FCC's action.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE tumult over potential movement on the long-stalled Uruguay Round under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) is being watched nervously
by one group with much to benefit - or to lose - from the outcome: American
farmers.
Over the years, enthusiasm has waned as the shape of a proposed settlement
in farm talks emerged. It became clear from the draft text, proposed by Mr
Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt director-general, that the long-promised aim of free
trade in agriculture would be no more than a goal for years to come.
Protected US commodity groups looked at what they would have to sacrifice so
their fellow farmers would get access to new markets and began to see some
validity in the Japanese argument for 'food security'.
The anxiety is compounded by the unseen presence of the White House 'puppet
master' - Mr James Baker, former and possibly future secretary of state.
'He'd sell us out in a second,' said one farm leader.
One prominent participant on the US side is the American Soyabean
Association, whose long-delayed case against the EC oilseeds subsidies -
twice won in a Gatt dispute settlement panel - may well be enmeshed in a
final Gatt farm deal. In the hope of avoiding that linkage, the group has
been urging the administration to impose Dollars 1bn (Pounds 562m) in
sanctions against the EC since August, when a 60-day negotiation period
under Gatt expired.
Sixty US senators signed a letter to the administration last month urging
the US to 'take action to enforce its Gatt rights'. With this kind of
pressure on the administration, there are fears US officials will trade
wheat for soyabeans - agreeing to a possible EC offer to limit its oilseeds
production to 7m-8m tonnes - in exchange for a larger share of the
subsidised wheat trade.
In Minnesota, Mr Mark Ritchie, head of the Institute for Agriculture and
Trade Policy, has been a powerful force in organising US farmer resistance
to Gatt. From the centre of a worldwide network of similarly concerned
farmers, he fears the talks are on the verge of a breakthrough. 'Bush has to
have something to show domestically for his focus on international issues,'
he says. 'He has a club called oilseeds hanging over the Europeans, and they
have the key to unlocking the Gatt deal.'
EC officials are aware that President George Bush badly wants a deal, and
they are most likely to get their best offer now.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH three days remaining until crucial EC-US talks on a trade
liberalisation agreement in the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, officials in Brussels are focusing on how to overcome
French opposition to potential European concessions on agriculture.
French government spokesman, Mr Louis Mermaz, said the new agriculture
minister, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, had firm instructions to defend French
trade interests.
Mr Soisson left last night for Brussels, to meet EC Commission President
Jacques Delors. 'He has gone with extremely firm instructions concerning the
defence of France trade interests,' Mr Mermaz said after a cabinet meeting.
Mr Soisson's talks are seen as an attempt to co-ordinate a clear EC
bargaining position before the weekend talks.
One tactic gaining high-level support in the Commission is to stress the
huge benefits for France in the services sector if a Gatt deal was reached.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner and one of the EC's
lead negotiators in the talks, said yesterday France was 'very competitive'
in services.
The weekend talks in Brussels will cover all disputed areas, including farm
exports, services and market access. An outline deal would have to embrace a
'set of elements' which could be wrapped into a single package to be
negotiated in detail by the end of the year, EC officials said.
The talks, which begin on Sunday and may stretch into Monday, include Mr
Andriessen, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC
farm commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary.
The biggest obstacles are how far payments to EC farmers in compensation for
big price cuts agreed in the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform should
be exempt from cuts under the Uruguay Round 'final act'; how far the EC must
cut its subsidised farm exports, and the amount of subsidy; and how to
ensure a 'peace accord', whereby the US agrees to forgo future retaliation
against what it considers unfair competition.
Mr Andriessen said yesterday he had a clear mandate from the Council of
Ministers meeting this week in Luxembourg to negotiate, even if it meant
taking some risks.

The main farmers' union, FNSEA, is furious with Brussels 'betrayal' in first
selling the Common Agricultural Policy reform as a 'shield against Gatt',
and now asking them for further concessions in Gatt. Their chief complaint
is the 'unfair' way in which Gatt proposals would cut EC and French exports
back far more than US exports.

JAPANESE and US car makers have made little progress in implementing the
agreement to boost US car imports into Japan reached when President George
Bush visited Japan in January.
Toyota acknowledged yesterday that it was still negotiating with General
Motors, the largest US producer, over a plan for Toyota to import 5,000 more
GM cars a year.
The deal between the two companies was the second largest component in the
an overall agreement in which five Japanese manufacturers agreed to import
an additional 20,000 US cars by 1994.
The agreement, designed to ease trade frictions, was signed by US car
industry executives who accompanied Mr Bush and was one of the most
controversial aspects of his visit.
However, there were signs yesterday of a renewal of trade friction over cars
after a lull since the start of the year.
The Japanese Automobile Association accused the US Congress of erecting a
non-tariff barrier against cars made at factories owned by foreign
manufacturers by attaching labels which identify foreign-made components.
According to the Japanese Automobile Importers Association, car imports from
the US in the first nine months of the year were up just 2,713 to 25,730.
Most of the rise was accounted for by a surge in sales of the US version of
Honda's Accord, which is not covered by the January agreement.
Imports of the US Honda Accord have risen from 10,541 in the first nine
months of last year to 13,840 in the same period this year.
Sales of GM cars fell from 7,146 to 7,041 in the first nine months, while
Ford's sales rose by 48 to 2,419 and Chrysler's were up 50 at 1,171.
The negotiations between Toyota and GM have been complicated because Yanase,
another Japanese car distributor, already has the right to import GM cars.
Toyota, Honda and Nissan said they were proceeding with plans to more than
double their purchases of US-made components by 1994.
But none of the companies could say how much they had increased US
purchasing so far this year.

THE choice of a Japanese supercomputer by the country's Ministry of
Education appears set to become an embarrassing trade dispute between Tokyo
and Washington, which hoped the ministry would choose a US machine.
The ministry chose a supercomputer made by NEC of Japan over a model from
Cray Research of the US, which appealed in July against the decision to a
new disputes panel.
But the panel this week rejected the complaint from Cray, whose political
influence in the US has ensured that supercomputers have been a sensitive
bilateral trade issue for the past decade.
Cray described the panel's decision as 'disappointing', but stronger words
are likely to be used after Mr John Rollwagen, the company's chairman,
arrives in Tokyo today.
His company had complained that the ministry's institute for fusion science,
which bought the machine, allegedly set technical specifications favourable
to NEC and leaked information to the company.
NEC said yesterday the US supercomputer market was less open than Japan's.

FT  09 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Talks on how to mollify France
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH three days remaining until crucial EC-US talks on a trade
liberalisation agreement in the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), senior officials in Brussels are focusing on how
to overcome French opposition to potential European concessions on
agriculture.
Last night, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President, was holding
talks with Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's new farm minister, and Mr Frans
Andriessen, the EC commissioner responsible for external affairs, in a move
seen as trying to co-ordinate a clear EC bargaining position ahead of the
weekend talks.
One tactic gaining high-level support side the European Commission is to
stress the huge benefits for France in the services sector if a Gatt deal
was reached.
Mr Andriessen, one of the EC's lead negotiators in the weekend talks, said
yesterday that France was 'very competitive' in services. It was important
not to focus solely on the agriculture sector, however politically
sensitive, he said.
The weekend talks in Brussels will cover all disputed areas, including farm
exports, services and market access. An outline deal would have to embrace a
'set of elements' which could be wrapped into a single package to be
negotiated in detail by the end of the year, EC officials said.
In a little-noticed speech this year, Mr Delors made such a link. He asked
rhetorically if France could accept a reduction of FFr2bn (Pounds 235m) in
cereals exports, if it could export FFr5bn in industrial goods and FFr2bn in
services, if the Uruguay Round were completed.
The weekend talks, which begin on Sunday and may stretch into Monday,
include Mr Andriessen, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Ray
MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture
secretary.
The biggest obstacles are how far payments to EC farmers in compensation for
big price cuts agreed in the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform should
be exempt from cuts under the Uruguay Round 'final act'; how far the EC must
cut its subsidised farm exports, and the amount of subsidy; and how to
ensure a 'peace accord', whereby the US agrees to forgo future retaliation
against what it considers unfair competition.
Mr Andriessen said yesterday he had a clear mandate from the Council of
Ministers meeting this week in Luxembourg to negotiate, even if it meant
taking some risks. 'The risk not to succeed is more dangerous than the risk
of succeeding,' he said.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Sukhumi braced against attack: Georgian troops on alert as
refugees flee Abkhazian capital
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REFUGEES were last night streaming out of Sukhumi, capital of the autonomous
republic of Abkhazia in Georgia, as Georgian forces prepared to defend it
against an all-out attack on the town. At battlelines just five miles north
of the city the two sides exchanged gun fire.
The panicky exodus continued as Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president,
warned that the ethnic clashes in the region could become full-scale war.
The official Itar-Tass news agency reported that Mr Yeltsin had agreed to
talks next Tuesday on a warship off Sukhumi with Mr Eduard Shevardnadze,
Georgia's leader, and Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, Abkhazian president.
Abkhazia is attempting to secede from Georgia, although Abkhazians make up
less than 20 per cent of the region's 500,000-strong population.
The Georgian government is reinforcing positions around the Black Sea town,
once a coveted vacation spot, in an effort to hold it against the Abkhazian
forces, which have been swelled by volunteers from the North Caucasus region
of the Russian federation. Georgia's military say that detachments of the
Russian army using the latest T-80 tanks flown into the nearby base of
Gudauta are also fighting on the Abkhazian side.
Crowds mainly of women and children besiege the few aircraft which leave
each day. The airport was bombed on Tuesday and a radar ship was reported
damaged by shells in Sukhumi harbour early yesterday morning.
The refugees wait in crowds around the runway, carrying a few personal
possessions. Many claim to have been waiting up to three days. Some people
were also leaving by small boats until bad weather closed that route
yesterday.
Mr Shevarnadze, the sole candidate for the post of parliamentary chairman in
elections due to be held on Sunday, is under growing pressure to stem the
tide of military defeat. In the past three days he has increasingly blamed
'reactionary circles' in Russia for fomenting war in Georgia and for
interfering on the side of the Abkhazians in their bid to secede.
But a Russian Foreign Ministry official was quoted by Tass newsagency
yesterday as saying that Russian forces were observing strict neutrality.
The small, 5m-strong former Soviet republic is now gripped with a war fever
as young men throng the airport in Tbilisi, the capital, carrying rifles en
route to the front. This has pushed all other issues in the election to the
background - including the deepening economic crisis and the progressive
breakdown of services and supplies.
Mr Zurab Zhvania, a member of the ruling state council and leader of the
Green party, said: 'It is absolutely certain that the Russians are trying to
take Abkhazia for themselves and they are using the North Caucasian peoples
who want access to the sea.'
He and other Georgian politicians believe Mr Yeltsin - who warned last
weekend that he would protect the Russians in Georgia and has assigned the
guarding of the main railway line in Georgia to the Russian army - is now
under the influence of 'imperialist' army commanders who are attempting to
win back much of the former Soviet territory.
Mr Levan Indrava, an influential figure in Georgian politics and an aide to
Mr Shevardnadze, said that 'Yeltsin has given us an ultimatum but when he is
no longer president of Russia he will be nothing. Shevardnadze is a world
figure.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / Ukraine emerges as a power to be reckoned with
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S emergence as one of Europe's main military heavyweights is shown
starkly in the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) latest
Military Balance.
The break-up of the Soviet Union has left Ukraine with an air force of about
1,100 combat aircraft, more than any Nato country in Europe and more than
twice as big as any of Moscow's former Warsaw pact allies.
Although Ukraine's armed forces, at 230,000, are smaller than those of
Poland, its holdings of tanks and armoured vehicles are bigger than those of
any European nation after Russia and Germany. This is set to remain so after
reductions in heavy land weaponry and aircraft are completed under the
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.
Ukraine and Russia have an unresolved dispute over strategic nuclear
weapons. This has now been given a new twist by Russia's surprise decision
to claim jurisdiction over all the former Soviet Union's nuclear weapons.
Ukraine has reacted angrily to the announcement by Marshal Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States joint forces,
that he was ready to turn over all the weapons to Russia immediately.
The IISS has had to reorganise radically the material contained in its
annual publication - which for more than 30 years set out a balance of
forces between east and west - to take account of the abolition of the
Warsaw Pact and the disintegration of both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.
In the Middle East, the institute has revised upwards its estimate of the
artillery strengths of both Iran (increased from 1,000 to more than 1,300
heavy guns) and Iraq (1,200 instead of 1,000). Recorded additions to Iran's
air force include 10 modern Russian MiG-29 fighters (part of what is
reported to be a much larger purchase), a similar number of Su-24 attack
aircraft and 12 Chinese F-7 fighters (an updated version of the Soviet
MiG-21).
Iraq's army strength is estimated at 29 divisions, half the number in
existence before the 1991 Gulf conflict. These include seven Republican
Guard armoured and mechanised divisons, compared with four reported a year
ago. Naval capability is expected to be minimal for several years, although
more Iraqi naval vessels survived the war than was originally thought, the
IISS says.

THE Japanese government yesterday responded sharply to a suggestion by
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia that two of four disputed islands could be
handed back to Japan under a 1956 agreement.
Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said the Russian leader did not
fully understand the Japanese position.
Mr Yeltsin's comments came at a Moscow news conference shown on Japanese
television. He said he might reschedule his planned visit to Tokyo, which he
cancelled abruptly in September, if the Japanese accepted the return of
Shikotan and Habomai, the smallest of the four islands occupied by Soviet
troops at the end of the second world war.
Japan says it will not conclude a peace treaty with Russia or provide
substantial economic assistance unless Moscow recognises Japanese
sovereignty over the four islands, which it calls the Northern Territories.
'Our position is that we will be flexible if Russia recognises Japan's
sovereignty over the four islands,' Mr Kato said.

THE DEATH toll in Sunday's crash of an El Al cargo aircraft into two
Amsterdam apartment buildings is now thought to be less than the original
estimate of 250, but city officials say the true number may never be known.
Rescue workers have recovered 49 badly burnt bodies and do not expect to
find any more victims in the twisted wreckage of the 80 flats. A city
spokeswoman said the fierce temperatures of the fires which engulfed the
flats meant some bodies might be irrecoverable. The number of dead is still
expected to exceed 49, 'but we are cautiously optimistic that the figure of
250 will prove to be on the high side'.
The Amsterdam rescue team is to be helped by British investigators involved
in the recovery of bodies after the explosion of a Pan Am airliner over
Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, the town council of Lockerbie sent
a wreath of flowers to Amsterdam to express the town's condolences over the
Dutch air disaster.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Hungary makes striking switch to mass privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY, anxious to make privatisation more popular with investors and
voters and speed up the transfer of industry to the private sector, is
moving towards a mass distribution of companies lingering in state control.
The authorities plan to embark next year on a scheme owing much to
Czechoslovakia's voucher privatisation, Mr Tamas Szabo, Hungary's
privatisation minister, said in an interview yesterday.
The new initiative represents a striking departure for Hungary's
privatisers, who have until now set themselves against widespread local
distribution of state property, so much so that the word 'voucher' remains
taboo.
Western multinationals have dominated the Hungarian privatisation picture so
far. The first big privatisation deal was in 1990 with the sale for Dollars
150m to General Electric of a majority stake in state-owned Tungsram light
bulb producer. This was followed by the sale of Lehel, the refrigerator
maker, to Electrolux of Sweden. Last year a spate of sales of state-owned
consumer goods companies to western companies brought in Dollars 500m.
But Hungary has been compelled to shift ground. The sale of so much local
industry to foreign companies has proved politically increasingly unpopular.
There is also a feeling in Budapest that many of the most attractive
companies may already have been sold.
'We won't use the word voucher,' said Mr Szabo, admitting at the same time
that the new scheme would present 'a similar picture from the outside as the
Czech.'
No details of the Hungarian scheme have been released yet. But
Czechoslovakia's privatisation programme cuts across a wide spectrum with
Dollars 9.9bn worth of equity in 1,491 enterprises to be distributed this
summer. Over 8.5m citizens are participating, using vouchers bought for a
nominal sum, with two thirds entrusting their vouchers to one of the 460
private investment funds set up earlier this year.
The political impact of was underlined in Czechoslovakia's elections earlier
this year. Mr Vaclav Klaus, former finance minister, who masterminded the
programme, saw his party win an absolute majority in the Czech parliament.
In addition to the political attractions Hungary's initiative arises out of
dissatisfaction with the pace of privatisation which - even if the most
rapid in eastern Europe - is not on course to meet the government's target
of putting half the economy in private hands by 1994.
'The decisive argument is that we have to achieve a breakthrough,' said Mr
Szabo.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission's competition directorate is to examine the
collective fixing of fees, advertising restrictions and limitations placed
on entry to the professions, Mr Claus- Dieter Ehlermann, director general of
DG IV, the competition directorate said yesterday.
He told the Board of Chartered Accountants in Business conference in
Bristol, he endorsed stronger competition within professions in the European
Community. He questioned whether rules of entry to curb membership were
acceptable if free access offered no threat to a profession's reputation or
the public interest.
He raised doubts over different practices between member states for
authorising inter-professional associations; the need for compulsory
membership of professional orders; and the adequacy of self-regulation.
Mr Ehlermann laid down five principles underlying competition within the
professions reflected in the European Commission's work to date:
whether restrictions on competition in professions are justifiable or
excessive;
that national laws should not affect the application of EC competition
rules;
that collective fixing of fees or charges should be banned;
that international cooperation is viewed favourably as long as it does not
reserve national markets for national practitioners;
that restrictive practices with mainly national impacts be left to the
national authorities or courts to determine.

<TEXT>
THE commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia yesterday warned of a race
against time to prevent the deaths of up to 400,000 people this winter as
Bosnian officials said there had been 15,284 deaths in the six-month war in
the former Yugoslav republic.
General Phillipe Morillon, the French commander, said repairs of water,
electricity and roads were a priority of UN peacekeepers, who are due to be
boosted by about 6,000 additional troops this month.
He restated that the UN Protection Force was prepared to fire in
self-defence and in protection of civilian technicians. Bosnian Serb leaders
have pledged to respect the agreement to allow the UN force to help in
repairs to water and power supplies and protect civilians doing this.
The UN Security Council appears ready to approve a western resolution
banning Serbian combat flights over Bosnia-Hercegovina today in a measure
that could eventually lead to military enforcement.
Britain and France demurred over an initial US proposal to permit the
immediate use of allied fighter aircraft to enforce the ban, believing
aerial dogfights could place UN peacekeepers at risk as they escorted
humanitarian aid convoys.
Speaking in Belgrade, Gen Morillon said he 'believed radar and AWACS would
be sufficient control' rather than fighter aircraft. But a western diplomat
in Belgrade said Serb forces had used combat planes on Wednesday in an
attack on Gradacac, the northernmost Moslem stronghold in Bosnia.
Under the resolution agreed among the three powers, the Security Council
would undertake to 'consider urgently the further measures necessary to
enforce this ban' only in the event that it was contravened by Serbian
aircraft.
There is provision for monitoring of the no-fly order by UN forces,
'including the placement of observers where necessary at airfields in the
territory of former Yugoslavia.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / Poland escapes label of central Europe's 'sick man':
Warsaw's surprisingly self-confident government has achieved results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANGER of Poland becoming the 'sick man' of central Europe, plagued by
weak governments and squabbling politicians, has receded recently. Against
the background of an unexpected export-led recovery. Ms Hanna Suchocka,
Poland's first female prime minister, has forged a confident government
team.
It has won the conditional approval of President Lech Walesa and confounded
those who doubted the cohesive power of a coalition government whose members
share common roots in the former anti-communist Solidarity alliance.
Taking advantage of the summer break, the government, which includes Mr Jan
Krzysztof Bielecki, a former prime minister, and several others who held key
portfolios in the first two post-communist governments, worked out a
co-ordinated economic, political and social strategy.
An International Monetary Fund team was the first to examine the resulting
policy mix. The government's priorities are to cut a growing budget deficit,
speed up the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, depoliticise pay
bargaining and sustain the export-led recovery in industrial output without
reigniting inflation. The IMF team promised to return to Warsaw this month
to negotiate a new 15-18 month IMF loan agreement to replace the original
Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 950m) three-year extended term facility agreed in
April 1991. This was suspended last September when the government overshot
agreed budget deficit, inflation and other parameters.
The figures presented to the fund showed that industrial output, including
that from the debt-ridden public sector, started to rise in April after a
two-year decline which cut production by around 45 per cent from pre-reform,
1989 levels. By July factory output was 9 per cent higher than a year ago.
Polish competitiveness has been restored thanks to a decline in real wages
and gradual devaluation of the zloty. Exports rose 12.5 per cent over the
first half to Dollars 6.88bn, while imports fell 8 per cent to Dollars
5.9bn, resulting in a Dollars 976m trade surplus and Dollars 389m current
account surplus.
On the negative side, however, a severe drought is expected to cut farm
output by 10 per cent this year while unemployment continues to rise,
reaching nearly 2.3m, or 12.6 per cent of the labour force at mid-year.
Inflation, at 41 per cent in July, is lower than last year's average 60 per
cent but is expected to climb again in the second half. Higher food prices
and much higher government spending over the second half of the year will
boost inflationary pressures towards the year's end.
Cutting the budget deficit from an expected 8.5 per cent of GDP to 5.5 per
cent next year is crucial for curbing inflation and preventing the crowding
out of the private sector by insatiable public sector demands on limited
capital and savings. The government intends to tackle the problem at both
ends by pruning public spending and raising income through tax reforms and
training a small army of tax collectors. Over the last year the
profitability of state-owned enterprises has fallen while much of the fast
growing private sector, which now makes up about half the total economy, has
managed to evade paying taxes.
As a result tax revenues were 39 per cent below plan over the first half
while spending on pensions, unemployment pay and other social programmes
continued to rise. Without tough government action the deficit was expected
to soar to about 100,000bn zlotys (Pounds 4.15bn), over 8 per cent of GDP,
by the end of the year.
The government now aims to cut the projected deficit by 9,500bn zlotys in
the fourth quarter and 70,000bn in 1993. The package includes a 10 per cent
cut in the real value of pensions and other social payments and a 10 per
cent increase in consumer taxes prior to the introduction of a value added
tax system and better tax collection next year. More controversially, the
package also includes a temporary 10 per cent import surcharge on 75 per
cent of Polish imports. The latter will have to be cleared with both the
European Community and the Gatt.
To sweeten the bitter pill of lower social security payments Ms Suchocka
last month unveiled what she called an 'enterprise pact' designed to involve
workers more closely in the fate of their enterprises and at the same time
depoliticise wage negotiations and labour relations. The hated 'popiwek' tax
on wage increases is to be abolished in favour of free collective
bargaining, with the proviso that wage increases not related to productivity
gains will not be financed by the government.
The emergence of an unexpectedly self-confident government does not mean
that Poland is without problems. The economic package still has to be
approved by parliament. But the lower house, the Sejm, remains fragmented
among many small groups which support the government but are prone to
factionalism. This could lead to splits that would weaken the government's
tenuous majority, although Mr Henryk Goryszewski, the deputy prime minister
with overall responsibility for the economy, insists that ideological
disputes in parliament - over issues like abortion or the fate of former
communists - will not be allowed to derail the government's efforts to find
pragmatic solutions to Poland's many problems.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Row erupts over treasury bill boycott call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL by the populist Lombard League to refuse to buy Italian treasury
bills has provoked a parliamentary storm and the threat of legal action.
The call yesterday by Mr Marco Formentini, the league's parliamentary
spokesman, was seen in parliament as an attempt to undermine Italy's
credibility in time of financial crisis.
Mr Franco Reviglio, the budget minister, described the interview as
'irresponsible', and Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, announced he
was considering legal action. This is the latest escalation of the league's
campaign to embarrass what it regards as a corrupt, free-spending government
in Rome living at the expense of the hard-working north.
The league has also advocated a campaign of non-payment of taxes.
But it has become more vocal in the wake of its dramatic success in
elections in the northern city of Mantua two weeks ago, when it obtained 34
per cent of the vote and humiliated the traditional parties.
The league has also forced the government to change its mind about
postponing other regional elections and these will now go ahead in the
northern cities of Monza and Varese on December 13.
By calling for a boycott of treasury bills - which are widely bought by
small Italian savers - the league may have overstepped itself by forcing the
other parties closer to the coalition government.
Yesterday, Mr Reviglio said the government would be seeking a vote of
confidence in the chamber of deputies on the decree, announced two months
ago, seeking special authority to carry out reforms of pensions, public
health, the civil service and local administration.
The senate has already passed the decree but it has become bogged down in
the chamber of deputies and the government is anxious to push it through as
quickly as possible to speed up discussion and approval of the 1993 budget.
It is the second time the government has sought a motion of confidence, the
previous occasion being the July emergency budget.

cent so far this year, production has been cut and there are still no signs
of improvement in the sector, according to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, president of
the VCI industry association, writes Christopher Parkes.
He said the industry's volume output had risen 1 per cent in the first three
quarters. However, demand had fallen markedly in the third quarter, leading
to production cuts.
Mr Hilger is head of Hoechst, which recently reported a 20 per cent decline
in profits in the first six months of this year. Producer prices had fallen
by an average of 2 per cent and the industry's total sales in the first nine
months had fallen to DM125bn (Pounds 50bn), slightly below last year's
figure.
Speaking to VCI members, Mr Hilger said that business prospects among the
most important users of chemicals gave little grounds for optimism.
The appreciation of the D-Mark had further increased the industry's
difficulties, and association members would have to come to terms with the
fact that sales this year would not reach 1991 levels.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Deutsche Aerospace blames defence review for job cuts

DEUTSCHE Aerospace (Dasa), Germany's principal civil and defence aviation
contractor, yesterday blamed uncertainty over defence spending and the
downturn in the civil aviation market for its decision to cut 7,500 jobs by
the end of 1994.
'The main reason is that the role of the Bundeswehr, the German armed
forces, is completely unclear,' a spokesman said yesterday. 'We don't know
what role it will have in the future. In the meantime, we do not expect
there to be any significant large defence contracts in the next two years,
which could help us through this period.' The company, which is part of
Daimler-Benz, was at pains not to blame the German defence ministry for its
extended reassessment of the role and requirements of the armed forces,
while saying pointedly that 'it all depends on our democratic process'.
However, it is clear that the cuts, amounting to more than 10 per cent of
the company's 70,000 workforce, may not be the final decision, because they
do not make any allowance for a possible German pull-out from the European
Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme, or any replacement.
'The EFA is still included in our calculations,' the spokesman said. 'These
redundancies or job cuts are not a consequence of that uncertainty. If
Germany finally were to pull out of any programme, they would be much
worse.' A breakdown of the job cuts shows that 3,300 will come from the
civil and military aircraft division of Dasa - two thirds from military
aircraft, one third from the civilian side. Of those, 800 must be borne by
Deutsche Airbus, where the works council yesterday expressed its surprise
and hostility towards the company decision. Another 2,750 job losses will
fall on the defence systems division, including weapons manufacture,
missiles, radar and communications.
Some 1,000 losses must come from the propulsion division making engines, and
500 from the space systems division.
The company's space division could suffer further from a review next month
by the European Space Agency at a meeting in Granada, Spain.
The gathering is expected to agree a Franco-German proposal to reduce the
Hermes space shuttle programme to no more than a 'technology programme', and
to axe the 'free flyer' which was to service the Columbus space station.
While Dasa said that the job cuts would be carried out wherever possible
without harsh social consequences, there might have to be some dismissals,
in addition to early retirement and non-replacement of departing workers.
Although the company was at pains to stress its confidence in defence
contracting as a pillar of its future activities, the decision to cut so
many jobs because of the uncertainty will call into question again the
wisdom of Daimler-Benz creating such a giant subsidiary as Dasa, so heavily
reliant on government contracts.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Bank of Italy lowers short-term rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and HAIG SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy yesterday announced it was lowering as of today its fixed
short-term interest rate charged to banks by half a percentage point to 16
per cent.
The basic discount rate remained unchanged at 15 per cent. But the move to
lower the fixed short-term rate is in line with the bank's desire to reduce
the spread between short-term rates and the base rate, provoked by recent
turbulence in the currency markets. It also followed two days in which the
lira has recovered against the D-Mark amid signs in the market that the
parity had overshot too far against the German currency.
On Monday the lira had moved close to 1,000 against the D-Mark; but by
yesterday the lira was being quoted at 888.
The parity is close to a rate which the Italian monetary authorities had
previously regarded as reasonably stable. This represents a devaluation of
nearly 17 per cent against its level of September 14.
Over the past week dealings in the lira have been thin, about 20 per cent of
the normal volume, mainly accounted for by importers and exporters obliged
to operate with a floating rate, and this is believed to have caused the
fluctuations rather than speculation.
The rate cut came too late to affect the stock market, which had earlier
been boosted by a vote by the senate finance committee to recommend a
one-year suspension of Italy's complex and unpopular tax on capital gains on
share dealings. News of the vote contributed to the sharp rise on the Milan
stock exchange. The proposal to suspend the capital gains tax until
September 30, 1993, has still to be passed by the full senate, where it will
be considered next week. Approval is also required in the chamber of
deputies, but stockbrokers are confident MPs will pass the measure.
The suspension will exclude trading in blocks of shares representing more
than 2 per cent of a company's capital.
Stockbrokers have bitterly opposed the levy, which taxes capital gains at 15
per cent or 25 per cent depending on how taxpayers choose to pay. They blame
it for eroding speculative sentiment and depressing share values.
They add that the tax, introduced in February 1991, has also been
disappointing for the Finance Ministry, as low trading volumes and depressed
share values have kept receipts below expectations.
The government has recognised the tax is unsatisfactory, but has so far been
unwilling to suspend it, in part because such action might be seen as a sop
to the rich.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government has accepted that the two houses of parliament in Bonn
will in effect have the final say over the introduction of a single European
currency, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said yesterday.
Before Germany enters the final stage of Emu in 1997 or 1999, parliament
will decide on whether the strict preconditions for full European economic
and monetary union (Emu) have been fulfilled, he said. The agreement by the
government to have such a debate has appeared inevitable since the summer,
when the opposition Social Democrats made such a move a precondition for
ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Waigel, speaking in the first reading debate on ratification of the
treaty, insisted such a vote did not mean a second chance to ratify or
reject it, and did not amount to an 'opting out' clause like the special
deal for Britain. He conceded, however, that the final stage of Emu, in 1997
or 1999, would not be automatic.
'An investigation of whether the treaty has been fulfilled is the decisive,
final step before the beginning of economic and monetary union,' he said.
'Germany will not take part in any currency union in which not every member
state has observed the treaty requirements . . . The German government needs
a vote by the Bundestag before taking such a decision.'
Mr Waigel was clearly at great pains to reassure a sceptical public about
the future security and stability of a single European currency, even though
a clear majority of the Bundestag is in favour of ratification of the
Maastricht treaty.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Bundesbank says EC powers need reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community should revamp its decision-making processes if it is
to assume its proper role in world affairs, according to Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
vice-president of the Bundesbank.
It must also make corrections to the Maastricht formula to ensure that
political union advances in step with moves towards economic and monetary
union, he told a meeting in Berlin yesterday.
Without changes in decision-making, including the clarification and
implementation of subsidiarity, 'political, economic and monetary union
could prove unacceptable to the people of the community', Mr Tietmeyer
claimed.
The principle of subsidiarity should be established and implemented
according to the German definition: 'Give power to the upper political level
only when the tasks in question cannot be achieved at the lower level of
authority.'
'It is time subsidiarity was taken seriously and preparations made to put it
into effect,' he added. Without it, political, economic and monetary union
could prove unworkable, as had been demonstrated in other unions based on an
undue concentration of power.
Calling for 'new and more appropriate' decision-making structures, Mr
Tietmeyer said there should be no 'super-bureaucracy, but an organisation
with clearly-defined competences and decision-making powers'. He repeated a
Bundesbank statement made two years ago which insisted that if monetary
union were to prove durable, it needed to be underpinned by a more
far-reaching association in the form of full political union.
'Here, as the debate has shown, seems to lie a main deficiency of the
Maastricht concept that needs to be corrected in 1996, when the section on
political union will in any case be reviewed,' he said.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the vice-president of the European Commission, denied
yesterday that he was referring to Denmark when he called recently for
member states which refuse further integration to consider whether they
ought to leave the Community, Reuter reports from Helsinki.
Mr Bangemann made his statement last Saturday at a congress of Germany's
Free Democratic party.
Danish politicians have reacted angrily to Mr Bangemann's statement, with
the prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, advising the commissioner to do his
job and leave decision-making to EC governments. Mr Bangemann, on a visit to
Finland, told a news conference in Helsinki: 'I do want Denmark to be a
member of the Community.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / Currencies rise against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING, the dollar and the lira gained ground against the D-Mark yesterday
as expectations grew that the Bundesbank may cut interest rates later this
month.
Amid signs that the currency tensions across the world may be easing, the
Bank of Italy cut its official borrowing rate to take advantage of the
reduced pressure on the lira in recent days.
Italy's cut in its Lombard rate by 0.5 percentage points to 16 per cent
followed an easing in money market dealing rates over the past three days in
Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.
Yesterday's reduced strains on European currencies and the dollar followed
indications last week that the Bundesbank may be preparing the ground for a
cut in its credit rates soon, on account of the gloomy outlook for the
German economy.
However, a member of the Bundesbank council attempted to reduce some of the
speculation about an imminent cut in German rates. Mr Johann Gaddum said
recent interest rate adjustments had led some people to conclude that the
bank had undertaken a fundamental change of course.
'It is imperative to warn against these false expectations. The medium-term
aims of our policy remain unchanged,' he told a Luxembourg conference.
On foreign exchanges, sterling gained nearly two pfennigs to close in London
at DM2.49, and rose further in New York to DM2.4967. The rise came in spite
of a cool response from markets to Mr Norman Lamont's speech at the Tory
party conference, on the grounds that he specified few changes in economic
policy.
Hopes of a cut in UK rates, now 9 per cent, gave a spurt to share prices on
the London stock market, where the FT-SE 100 Index gained 21.7 to 2,538.8.
The dollar rallied against the D-Mark, partly because of speculation that US
interest rates are unlikely to come down before the US presidential
election. The dollar closed in London at DM1.4730, more than 3 pfennigs up
on the day and nearly 6 pfennigs higher on the week. In New York it advanced
to DM1.4825.
The lira closed at L888.0 against the D-Mark, L22.9 higher on the day, and
L92 higher than its low point on Tuesday, giving the Bank of Italy the
opportunity to cut rates to inject demand into the flagging Italian economy.
In New York the lira was quoted at L880.41.
The market's belief that German interest rates may soon come down is partly
based on the Bundesbank's recent operations in the German money market.
Late last week, the Bundesbank reduced the rate at which it deals in the
German money market to 8.9 per cent, 0.6 points below its key emergency
Lombard rate. Economists believe that the reduction in market dealing rates
makes it technically easier for the bank to cut the Lombard rate without
adversely affecting the D-Mark.
At the same time, the Bundesbank has fuelled expectations of a further cut
in rates by softening the emphasis it places on one of its key indicators in
the growth of money supply.
Recent policy statements by Bundesbank council members suggest that the bank
is drawing back from its insistence that the M3 measure of money supply -
which includes cash in circulation, current accounts and short-term deposits
 -should be regarded as the most important indicator of monetary stability.
In his speech yesterday, Mr Gaddum reasserted the bank's strategy: to steer
money supply growth rates back into the target range of 3.5 per cent to 5.5
per cent a year, and reduce inflation.
However, he warned, it would not be possible to meet money growth targets
this year. After running at 9 per cent in August, growth in the main M3
measure was further accelerated by the bank's interventions during the
recent currency crisis.
Yesterday, Denmark's central bank cut the rates at which it deals in its
money market by 0.2 points to 8.9 per cent, in line with the Bundesbank's
move.

FT  09 OCT 92 / World News in Brief: Two car bombs explode in central London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two car bombs exploded in central London last night, causing transport
chaos. A police officer was slightly injured. The blasts came only hours
after the IRA admitted responsibility for two explosions in the capital on
Wednesday.
The first blast last night, outside the London Dungeon tourist attraction
near London Bridge station, came at 9.30, 20 minutes after a warning. An
hour later a second blast hit Melcombe Street in the West End near
Marylebone station. Police later carried out a controlled explosion on a
suspect car in St Pancras Way near St Pancras and King's Cross stations.
Public transport services were severely disrupted but British Rail and
London Transport hoped to run normal services this morning.
The IRA statement, timed to coincide with the Conservative party conference
in Brighton, had said the bombs demonstrated 'that there will be no respite'
in their campaign. Last night, Mr George Churchill-Coleman, head of the
Anti-Terrorist Squad, said at the scene of the Melcombe Street blast: 'These
things are found from time to time. It does not mean that the terrorists
control London at all. We have control.'

FT  09 OCT 92 / New market indices launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW UK stock market indices have been launched by the Financial Times, the
London Stock Exchange and the Institute and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The indices will cast more light on the performance of the stock market,
particularly of second-rank UK companies.
They will also allow investors to monitor the performance of individual
industry sectors minute-by-minute during the day.
The indices complement the FT-SE 100 index and the FT-Actuaries All-Share
index, which are expected to remain the UK market's principal real-time
index and the main end-of-day performance benchmark, respectively.
The new indices, publicly available from Monday, are:
The FT-SE Mid 250, covering the 250 companies that rank below the FT-SE 100
in size. This is a real-time index, containing companies with market
capitalisations of roughly Pounds 150m to Pounds 1bn.
These are typically substantial national companies, rather than the UK-based
international companies in the FT-SE 100.
The FT-SE Actuaries 350, the top 350 UK shares (the FT-SE 100 plus the FT-SE
Mid 250). Industry baskets based on these 350 stocks will be calculated
minute-by-minute throughout the day. The sector classification is that used
in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index.
The FT-Actuaries All-Share index will from January be extended by about 200
shares, to cover a higher proportion of the market. A third new index will
also be added, the FT-SE Small Cap, covering All-Share members that rank
below the FT-SE Mid 250 in size. The 30-share FT Ordinary index is
unaffected.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Fury over pit closures plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS' LEADERS last night expressed fury over British Coal's plans to
announce a sweeping programme of pit closures and job cuts as early as next
week to clear the way for privatisation of the state-owned company.
The National Union of Mineworkers called on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, to resign and accused him of making inaccurate comments.
A senior member of the moderate Union of Democratic Mineworkers called for a
national strike to defend the industry.
The government is determined to proceed with restructuring of British Coal
although more than 25,000 jobs would be lost.
An announcement next week would pre-empt the reconvening of parliament on
October 19. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary, said the announcement
should not be made when ministers could not be called to account in
parliament.
Mr Heseltine refused to confirm the timing of the announcement, but told an
interviewer: 'Everybody knows we are facing extremely difficult decisions.'
According to documents leaked this month from the Trade and Industry
Department, British Coal intends to shut 30 pits, with the closures
announced 'in one go'.
The NUM was angry about reports that Mr Heseltine had said decisions were
being forced on the government because of the industry's lack of
performance. Mr Frank Cave, the union's vice-president, said Mr Heseltine's
comments were 'quite simply untrue'.
He added: 'Either he is seeking deliberately to mislead the public or he is
appallingly ignorant about the coal industry. In either case, those remarks
on a question of such great importance raise serious doubts about his
stewardship of the coal industry and he should resign.'
The NUM said the closures would cost Pounds 2.1bn, a total of 50,000 jobs
would be lost in related industries and unemployment benefit and lost
taxation would cost Pounds 600m a year.
Mr Neil Greaterex, Nottinghamshire president of the UDM, said: 'What we need
is a general strike. It is not just miners' jobs at stake here.'
The restructuring will add to the government's economic woes but Mr
Heseltine believes shrinking British Coal to a commercially viable size
remains the overriding objective. British Coal relies on artificially priced
sale contracts to maintain its size. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has
indicated he will press ahead with a coal privatisation bill even if new
contracts, being negotiated with the electricity generators, are not agreed
soon.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Lamont opts for curbing inflation: Chancellor's future
remains in doubt after muted reception at party conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT yester-day sought to plug the gap in his economic policy
left by sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism by setting a
formal target of between 1 and 4 per cent for Britain's inflation rate.
In a speech which won him a respectful but less than ecstatic reception from
the Conservative party conference and London's financial markets, the
chancellor ruled out the sharp cuts in interest rates demanded by many
Tories. On BBC television last night he said the recent one-point cut and
sterling's depreciation was a 'very considerable loosening of policy'.
The instant judgment of his ministerial colleagues was that Mr Lamont's
long-term future at the Treasury remained uncertain.
His speech will be followed this morning by a determined attempt by Mr John
Major to reassert his authority over the party and to close the deep rifts
over Europe which have emerged at this week's conference.
After a day in which party activists tempered their affection for Lady
Thatcher with a rebuke for her vehement attacks on her successor's European
policy, Mr Major will underline his determination to ratify Maastricht.
In a statement for MPs accompanying his speech, Mr Lamont said the
centrepiece of his economic strategy outside the ERM would be a long-term
inflation objective of 2 per cent per year. That would mean an immediate
target range of 1 to 4 per cent for underlying price rises. By the end of
the current parliament in 1997, he expected inflation to be in the lower end
of that range.
Until now, the government has eschewed a formal target for prices, setting
out instead the goal of stable prices or consistently low inflation. But
without the anchor of the D-Mark, Mr Lamont was concerned to re-establish
the government's credibility with financial markets.
In August the underlying annual rate - retail prices excluding mortgage
interest payments - stood at 4.2 per cent but it may drop into Mr Lamont's
new range when the figures for September are published today.
The chancellor, foreshadowing the sharp reductions in many Whitehall budgets
in this year's spending negotiations, said that public sector pay awards
would bear much of the squeeze.
He said that the exchange rate - measured by its index against a basket of
currencies - would remain a significant factor in interest rates decisions.
But he stressed that there would be no specific target for the rate against
individual currencies.
The chancellor said that the conditions for ERM re-entry - an end to the
turbulence on foreign exchange markets, changes to the operation of the
system and closer realignment of the economic cycles in Germany and Britain
 -'are unlikely to be satisfied soon'. In the interim, the Treasury would
look at indicators including M0 and M4, the narrow and broad money supply
measures, and movements in the prices of assets such as houses.
Mr Lamont said inflation might on occasion burst out of the prescribed range
but pledged that, in those circumstances, the government 'would have a duty
to explain' why it had happened and how it would be rectified.
On interest rates, Mr Lamont said the one-point cut to 9 per cent in the
wake of sterling's departure from the ERM had been justified by the
inflation outlook. But he did not exclude a further reduction: 'In the
months ahead I must continue to fight the battle against inflation and take
no risks.'
Mr Lamont left the platform uncertain whether he had restored his authority.
After calls from party activists for reductions in interest rates,
colleagues were reluctant to rule out a reshuffle which would see Mr Lamont
leave the Treasury in the first half of next year.

FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: SKF to sell CTT stake to Sandvik
Cormorant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SKF, the Swedish roller bearing group, has reached preliminary agreement to
sell an 80 per cent stake in CTT Tools, the world's leading supplier of
high-speed steel cutting tools, to Sandvik Coromant.
Terms for the deal have not been finalised, but analysts suggest CTT as a
whole is worth around SKr1.2bn (Dollars 220m).
The acquisition would complement Sandvik Cormorant's operations in cemented
carbide tools, giving the group an estimated 13 per cent share of the
cutting tools market.
Mr Clas Ake Hedstroem, Sandvik Cormorant president, said the acquisition
would allow the group to offer clients a broader product range and achieve
physical distribution synergies.
Sandvik may also seek to buy the minority 20 per cent stake in CTT held by
Germany's Guenther, although discussions have not started.
SKF said it was seeking to sell its CTT stake because it wanted to
concentrate on its core roller bearing activities. But analysts also suggest
the group's balance sheet is under pressure following its purchase of the
special steels company Ovako.
Long-term loans climbed to SKr5.6bn at June 30 from SKr4.4bn at the start of
the year.
Frankfurt-based CTT has 3,900 employees, with operations spread across 24
companies in 11 countries. It manufactures and markets cutting tools such as
twist drills, taps, dies and milling tools.
Last year, CTT achieved sales of SKr1.9bn and had a loss after financial
items of SKr103m. In the first half, the operation incurred a SKr30m loss.
Sandvik Cormorant, part of the Sandvik Group, achieved sales of SKr4.9bn
last year.

HJ HEINZ, the US foods group, yesterday completed the deal to buy Wattie
Foods, New Zealand's biggest canned and frozen foods group, from Goodman
Fielder Wattie (GFW) for NZDollars 566m (USDollars 308m).
GFW, Australia's biggest foods group, had planned to sell the Wattie
division through a public flotation next month, which had been expected to
raise NZDollars 490m.
GFW is to use the money from the sale to buy Uncle Toby's, an Australian
cereals company, as part of its strategy to concentrate on baked foods and
cereals. It will retain some baking and related businesses in New Zealand
which operate under the Goodman name.
Heinz said yesterday it would allow Wattie to compete against Heinz products
in Australia. Both companies would be controlled directly from Heinz'
Pittsburg headquarters in the US, but under the existing local management.
Wattie Foods has annual sales of approximately NZDollars 750m, which
compares with Heinz' global sales of USDollars 6.58bn. Mr Tony O'Reilly,
Heinz chairman, said Wattie would provide the US group with an 'exciting
opportunity' to expand its presence in Asia using Heinz's expertise in
marketing, product development and global distribution.

GFW is to use the money from the Wattie sale to buy Uncle Toby's, a leading
Australian cereals company, as part of its strategy to concentrate on baked

New Zealand which operate under the Goodman name.
Heinz executives received approvals for the takeover from both the New
Zealand Overseas Investment Commission and the New Zealand Commerce
Commission earlier this month.
Petersville Sleigh, a division of the diversified Australian industrial
company Pacific Dunlop, had also expressed an interest in buying a stake in
Wattie Foods.
Some analysts believed this was due to Petersville's concerns over the
inroads Wattie Foods was making in Australia with a range of baked beans and
spaghetti. Wattie Foods has taken 15 per cent of the market, which has been
dominated by Petersville and Heinz, in the past six months.
Heinz said yesterday it would allow Wattie Foods to compete aggressively
against Heinz products in Australia. Both companies would be controlled
directly from Heinz' Pittsburg headquarters in the US, but under the
existing local management.
Wattie Foods has annual sales of approximately NZDollars 750m, which
compares with Heinz' global sales of USDollars 6.58bn.
Heinz plans to 'grow' Wattie Foods and use its production facilities. This
forms part of the Heinz plan to become a greater force in Japan and other
parts of Asia. The Wattie name will continue to be used in Australia, Japan
and other markets, with new products, including Weightwatchers, to be added
to the existing varieties.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, Heinz chairman, said Wattie Foods would provide the US
group with an 'exciting opportunity' to expand its presence significantly in
the Asian region using Heinz's expertise in marketing, product development
and global distribution. Mr O'Reilly said Wattie Foods was one of New
Zealand's most respected companies.
One of the main attractions for Heinz in buying the company was the New
Zealand economy which had 'benefited greatly from government policies which
had encouraged free trade and becoming a low cost producer in recent years.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Rival bids emerge in coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of a split among British Coal employees over how to mount a
buy-out of the company emerged yesterday as the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers and East Midlands Electricity confirmed plans to form a bidding
consortium.
The British Association of Colliery Management had earlier announced its
plans to purchase the company. Mr John Meads, general secretary, said last
night that rivalry would be 'unfortunate'. But he stressed that the ultimate
aim must be to preserve as much of British Coal as possible.
The UDM and East Midlands consortium is preparing plans for a buy-out that
would include a 20 per cent stake for employees. The consortium would be
willing to bid for the whole company, but would consider other structures if
the government preferred to break it up. One preference would be to split
British Coal into two equal sizes with a mix of deep and open-cast mining.
BACM believes British Coal should be sold as one piece to give it a viable
structure.
East Midlands and the UDM, who have been working on their plans for a year,
have established a steering group which includes Sir David White, deputy
chairman of the National Freight Corporation, itself the subject of a
successful buy-out in the early 1980s. Others members are Mr Dickson Mabon,
energy minister in the last Labour government, and Mr George Guise, former
director of Consolidated Gold Fields and adviser to Lady Thatcher.
The consortium hopes to attract two or three other members and is engaged in
talks with companies in mining production and equipment supply industries.
The government has said it wants privatisation to lead to an employee stake
in the business. Public money will be available to help employees put
together buy-out proposals.

FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz car sales fall 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ car sales worldwide in the first nine months of the year fell
by 7 per cent to 397,000, the company said yesterday.
The turnover of the car operations rose, however, by around 3.5 per cent, or
DM1bn (Dollars 700m), to DM30bn thanks to higher sales of Mercedes-Benz's
top-of-the-range S-Class luxury car, which is in its first full sales year
worldwide.
Mercedes-Benz car sales in Germany have dropped by 18 per cent in the first
nine months this year to 176,000. The company is being affected by falling
demand for its smaller 190 series, which will be replaced by a new
generation model early next year.
For the first time, Mercedes-Benz is expected be out-sold in western Europe
this year by BMW, its arch-rival. Mercedes-Benz forecast that its retail car
sales would regain some lost ground in the final quarter, however, and for
the full year would total around 550,000 worldwide, a drop of less than 1
per cent from 554,000 in 1991.
Sales in western Europe (excluding Germany) fell by 4 per cent in the first
nine months to 114,000, with declines in Italy and France but a rise of 7.7
per cent in the UK. Sales in the US rose by 9 per cent to 47,600, helped by
increased leasing sales.
Mercedes-Benz car sales in the Far East (excluding Japan) have jumped by 65
per cent in the first nine months to 15,000. Sales for the full year in the
region are expected to total 20,000, and the company expects to double this
total by the mid-1990s.
Mr Jurgen Hubbert, managing director of the Mercedes-Benz car division, said
yesterday that the company had no immediate plans to raise its car prices in
the UK in the wake of the devaluation of the pound against the D-Mark, as
its sales revenues were largely hedged until the end of the year.
The company has already raised its prices by an average of 5 per cent in
Spain, and other German carmakers such as Volkswagen and BMW have also
raised their prices in Italy. Volkswagen is expected to be the first German
carmaker to raise its list prices in the UK, with an increase of just under
5 per cent.
Mr Hubbert said Mercedes-Benz had increased investment in its car operations
by around 10 per cent this year to more than DM2.6bn. Investment would total
some DM13bn in the next five years, most importantly for the development of
new products.
He claimed that productivity in the final assembly operations of its new
Rastatt car plant had been increased by 20 per cent, compared with the
company's existing plants at Sindelfingen and Bremen.
Of the 10,500 jobs being cut by Mercedes-Benz in Germany this year, some
6,500 are being shed by the group's car operations and 4,000 from the
commercial vehicles business, he said.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Clark shoe board argued over new equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to introduce a foreign investor brought to a head the boardroom row
at C&amp;J Clark, one of Britain's largest private companies, and resulted in
calls for the chairman's dismissal.
The disclosure that Mr Walter Dickson, who became chairman in July last
year, sought to introduce a big foreign equity partner was made in a letter
to shareholders sent out on Monday night. The company is currently in talks
over a possible Pounds 150m bid backed by Electra Investment Trust.
The foreign investor proposed by Mr Dickson was to have provided between
Pounds 20m and Pounds 40m to pay for rationalisation in return for 10 per
cent to 20 per cent of the shares. This would have diluted existing
investors, including the 70 per cent held by the Clark family.
The letter claims Mr Dickson 'explicitly stated' that 'without this equity
injection, the company would be likely to fail'.
However, a spokesman for Clark strenuously denies that the chairman ever
made such a statement.
The letter was compiled by four directors, who claim to represent a majority
of the 500 family shareholders, in preparation for the extraordinary general
meeting on October 16.
The rebel board members are proposing to replace Mr Dickson, only the second
non-family chairman in 167 years, and Mr James Power, a non-executive
director.
The letter reveals that Clark, Britain's largest shoe manufacturer, warned
in August that profits would fall substantially in the year to January 31,
1993. The company, like many other UK shoe manufacturers, has been caught
out by recession, cheaper imports and sharply higher rents and rates.
However, the rebels say failure to act on recommendations made by
consultants McKinsey &amp; Co as early as 1988 has also contributed to Clark's
decline.
For example, the consultants forecast that Clark could achieve big savings
from imported shoes and uppers. Yet, 'less than half of the McKinsey planned
savings had been achieved by 1991'. The company still manufactures 60 per
cent of its output in the UK.
The rebels say they have been thwarted in attempts to introduce management
to address the problems of trading performance and product improvement.

equity capital
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAREBANKEN, Norway's biggest savings bank, said it had over-estimated its
equity capital partly due to a miscalculation of goodwill at the end of the
first half, Reuter reports.
It said it lowered the bank's group equity capital to 8.74 per cent, still
above the legal minimum, from 9.25 per cent. 'The difference is due to a
miscalculation of goodwill and an incomplete inclusion of deficits from the
bank's subsidiaries,' Sparebanken said.
From the end of 1992, banks' total equity must be at least 8 per cent of
risk-weighted balance sheet items.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Specialist keeps an eagle eye on the pula's rate: Tour
operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE much of British industry is preoccupied with sterling's gyrations
against the D-Mark or US dollar, Mr Bob Winder, finance director of travel
company Abercrombie and Kent, spends anxious hours monitoring the exchange
rates of the Botswana pula and Seychelles rupee.
A specialist in organising upmarket holidays in exotic locations,
Abercrombie and Kent does about a third of its package-tour business in
developing countries where outgoings have to be paid in what Mr Winder calls
'funny currencies'.
These are thinly traded, so it is impossible to obtain forward cover against
exchange rate fluctuations. Indeed, Barclays Bank is the only source of
Botswana pulas in London.
'This creates quite a problem,' says Mr Winder. 'We can either seek to
protect ourselves by buying a big pile of currencies like the Seychelles
rupee and putting them in the bank, or sweat it out. We are tending to sweat
it out.'
Many developing countries, including India and Tanzania, have started to
shift their tourism transactions to a hard currency, usually the US dollar,
so they reap the benefit of any fall in their own currencies.
In these cases, Abercrombie and Kent has routinely hedged its risks by
buying forward. But Mr Winder says the company has stopped taking out such
cover since sterling was floated and is waiting for trends in the foreign
exchange markets to become clearer.
Instead, it is delaying fixing final prices for its package tours - average
cost Pounds 2,500 - for as long as possible.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (13): New-found freedom - Profile of
Copenhagen Airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE working files of Mr Niels Boserup, chief executive of Copenhagen
Airports, are in boxes scattered across his office. Outside in the corridor
is the sound of workmen hammering.
Mr Boserup says that the chaos is a good sign. The group's headquarters are
being renovated, an indication of his company's new-found freedom to invest
as it pleases.
Copenhagen Airports, the state-owned group that runs Kastrup and Roskilde
airports, has only been a public limited company since October 1990.
'Before then we were a state body, covered by all of the restrictions of a
state body,' says Mr Boserup. He explains that the authority's expenditure
was put into one account while it drew income from another.
If the airports made money, it still had to ask a treasury sub-committee of
parliament to spend it.
'The transformation into a public limited company has led to big changes,'
he says. 'We can't ask the state for money any more. We have to earn it. The
group has used its new opportunities to tighten its ship and rein in
expenditure.'
The number of employees has been cut by about 4 per cent. The company has
stopped using outside electricians to repair the airports' monitor screens,
employing instead internal staff who had to be on site anyway, for
emergencies.
The group's financial performance remains steady, if not glowing. It made
DKr169m on a turnover of about DKr1.2bn during its first 15 months to
December 31 1991.
Mr Boserup expects the profits for the 12 months of 1992 to be greater than
last year's 15 months figure, on turnover of about DKr1bn.
The group, given its modest profits, faces some formidable capital
investment in the near future. Kastrup airport is set for rapid growth, the
company believes. At present, it has capacity for 15m passengers and handles
about 12m a year.
A recent study for the company reckons the airport will be used annually by
18m passengers by the end of the decade. Scandinavian Airlines System, the
main airline at Copenhagen, estimates it could reach 20m by then. That is
despite a 6.4 per cent fall in numbers last year because of the Gulf war.
Passenger growth will be partly driven by worldwide expansion in the use of
air travel, argues Mr Peter Hoeland, managing director of SAS Denmark.
However, he expects passenger throughput to increase significantly because
of political events in the region,
in particular the entry of Sweden, Finland and possibly Norway into the EC.
This will generate significant traffic through Copenhagen, Scandinavia's
main hub. In addition, SAS has already set up regular flights to Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia.
Further routes to St Petersburg, Leipzig, Krakow, Kiev and Minsk, either
already exist or will be established within a year.
'Europe is moving north and west and Copenhagen is ideally located to become
Europe's northern hub,' says Mr Hoeland.
Further growth will also be driven by new infrastructure projects. In
particular, the completion of motorway and high-speed train networks linking
Copenhagen with south Sweden will add 3.5m people to the airport's existing
5m catchment area, says Mr Hoeland. A railway station is planned at Kastrup
itself, linking the airport with the high-speed trains to Scandinavia and
Germany. A light railway capable or reaching the city centre in seven
minutes is also planned.
The airport has already embarked on a new DKr500m concourse at pier A, but
will need more terminal capacity to meet projected demand. There are two
plans on offer, one from SAS, the other from Copenhagen Airports. SAS wants
to create a terminal specially designed for SAS that will give the airport
and airline significant competitive advantage as a European centre.
It plans a DKr8.5bn terminal with a capacity of between 15m and 20m
passengers a year.
SAS wants the first stage of its terminal to be completed by July 1997, the
same date that the railway opens. The only problem is who pays for the
building.
The airport's balance sheet is incapable of handling the largest single
airport investment in Europe. Last year, the company spent only DKr396m on
capital investment. Meanwhile, SAS reported pre-tax profits for the first
six months of 1992 at only SKr502m on turnover of SKr16bn.
Neither SAS nor Copenhagen Airports wants to pay for the project.
Mr Boserup is proposing an alternative terminal, for use by all airlines.
This terminal, which he describes as modern but more conventional than SAS's
plans, would add about 7m passengers a year to existing capacity and would
cost about DKr2bn. He says if the SAS terminal is not started during the
next year, he will go ahead with the alternative plans.
The problem facing Mr Boserup is that an investment of DKr8.5bn would almost
certainly cast a shadow over Copenhagen Airports' future; the group is due
to be partly privatised. The Danish parliament passed legislation earlier
this year to sell 25 per cent of the company on the Danish stock exchange.
Mr Boserup says the flotation is unlikely to take place for 18 months, when
the company would be able to report three years' results - a requirement of
the Danish stock exchange.
'This is a major political challenge,' says Mr Hoeland. 'Although the
airport cannot carry such a large project on its balance sheet, there are
lots of financial instruments available. In the very near future we will
open negotiations with Mr Boserup on possible financial structures on how to
implement this project. We will be looking for institutions, such as pension
funds, in either Sweden or Denmark, which are prepared to look at a project
with a perspective of 20 to 30 years. I have no doubt the terminal will be
built.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hurricane wakes US natural gas
futures - The two-year-old NYMEX market has finally come of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Hurricane Andrew swept through one of the richest natural gas producing
regions of the US in late August, disrupting production, it spawned another
sort of tempest in the two-year-old natural gas futures pit at the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
Volume soared, prices climbed to successive contract highs, and every
serious player in the natural gas market stayed within sight of their
screen. Producers, sensing a bonanza, rushed to price output based on the
futures gains, while utilities and industrial natural gas consumers used
futures to lock in purchases before winter drove prices even higher.
The scene would not have been unusual had it been set in the NYMEX's big
crude oil ring. However, it signaled a rite of passage for the natural gas
industry, where futures are a newcomer, and the gentlemanly practice of
trading privately and with a handshake has until recently been the fashion.
'All this has happened in the last six months,' says Mr Mike Emerson, a
trading analyst at New Jersey-based KCS Energy Risk Management. 'When
natural gas futures first started, there were a lot of physicals people (gas
traders) who were avoiding the screen. They said futures didn't have a lot
to do with physicals prices. Now everyone is looking at the screen, quoting
prices at a differential to futures.'
Natural gas futures volume hit a daily record of 32,705 on September 23, and
natural gas options - just opened at the NYMEX on October 2 - have had a
respectable start-up volume of about 2,000 contracts per day. While small
compared with more established US futures contracts, volume is growing
steadily, traders say, and 'depth' in the pit has become sufficient to
swallow large orders without disruptive price movement.
What has happened, traders say, is that the gas market, after languishing
since the mid-1980s, has been jolted by volatility. They say this demanded
more efficient pricing and that the gradually maturing futures market was in
place to meet that demand. Natural gas price volatility this year has
rivaled that in crude oil and even foreign currencies, driving dealers to
the protection offered by futures, options, and over-the-counter swaps.
In January, at the end of a very warm winter, US gas users found themselves
holding burdensome inventories, and futures prices for February delivery
skidded to lows near Dollars 1.046 per million British thermal units. Cash
prices followed. Six months later, the hurricane interrupted Louisiana Gulf
deliveries while utilities' inventory levels were historically low and the
winter heating season was just around the corner.
NYMEX natural gas futures for October delivery soared to Dollars 2.743 per
million Btu, a gain of more than 150 per cent from February. While the price
disruptions from Hurricane Andrew are viewed as temporary, Richard Kalmas,
manager of gas supply for Northern Illinois Public Service Co., which
delivers gas to residential and commercial customers in the upper Midwest,
says he isn't counting on gas prices easing until early spring.
'We have to buy gas with the anticipation that winter will be normal or
colder than normal. Since our first concern is having a secure supply, we
can't hope for a warm winter and hold back purchases hoping prices will go
down,' he said.
Since many utilities are in the same position, and since most are public
service companies that can pass gas price increases through to their
customers, supply concerns may continue to outweigh sobering price gains in
purchasing decisions.
Mr Guy Ausmus, senior energy buyer for Chicago-based Inland Steel, thinks
the 'emotional' reaction of the futures market to the hurricane added 70
cents to natural gas prices, and he expects prices to level off by spring.
Inland regularly uses the gas futures for price protection, and Mr Ausmus
says the contract still has some growing to do to service an American market
that consumes 53 billion cubic feet of gas per day.
'It has to grow, and this price run-up will do a lot to help it grow,' Mr
Ausmus said of the futures. 'To the extent that it grows, especially now
that (NYMEX) has added options trading, this market will become super
efficient.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Computer People runs into loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult economic conditions on both sides of the Atlantic were blamed by
Computer People Group, the computer personnel provider, for pre-tax losses
of Pounds 135,000 in the six months to June 30.
This compared with previous profits of Pounds 669,000 and was struck from
revenues of Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 34.8m).
Losses per share amounted to 0.73p, against earnings of 3.53p, and the
interim dividend payment is being trimmed from 2.1p to 0.65p.
The directors said the results included Pounds 493,000 of operating costs
which were now eliminated.

FT  08 OCT 92 / German bourses combine to take on Europe: David Waller on
the dawning era of Finanzplatz Deutschland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's fragmented stock exchanges, divided between eight different
centres, have at last decided to share a common future. The announcement
yesterday that the exchanges would be brought under a single holding company
 -Deutsche Borse, the German Exchange - from the beginning of 1993 is
intended to put an end to decades of damaging rivalry between Frankfurt, by
far the dominant market, and its smaller sisters.
The decision is a big step towards the realisation of Finanzplatz
Deutschland, the often-postponed ideal of Germany as a strong financial
centre. Yet it also leaves some difficult questions unanswered.
By providing for the exchanges in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Munich, Hanover,
Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Bremen to retain their independent existence,
it ensures that regional tensions will linger within the new structure. And
by providing for the parallel development of screen and floor-based trading,
it leaves scope for rivalry between the two systems.
Still, the agreement is an important achievement, actively encouraged by the
federal government. Ten months ago, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor,
visited the Frankfurt exchange for the first time, calling for stronger
capital markets in Germany. Days earlier, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister,
had presented a package of policy proposals designed to strengthen
Finanzplatz Deutschland.
The creation of Deutsche Borse was only one such measure. Mr Waigel also
called for an insider dealing law and a centralised supervisory body for the
German securities industry. The plan was to implement these measures by the
end of the current year.
That timetable will be impossible: Germany is unlikely to have a law against
insider dealing law or a new supervisory body until the end of next year.
However, as Mr Friedrich von Metzler, chairman of the Frankfurt bourse, said
in a recent interview, the creation of Deutsche Borse is the necessary first
step.
The agreement represents a series of compromises: between Frankfurt and the
other exchanges; between the big banks and the smaller dealers; between the
proponents of screen-based dealing and trading on a physical exchange floor.
The Frankfurt exchange, accounting for some 70 per cent of German securities
business, will be transformed into a new holding company which will acquire
the Deutsche Terminborse (the German screen-based futures and options
exchange) and the Deutsche Kassenverein, the hitherto-independent clearing
and settlement agency for German securities.
The seven other bourses will then buy 10 per cent of the new holding company
between them, and will be entitled to four seats on an enlarged supervisory
board.
A further 10 per cent will be offered to the Makler, Germany's official
broking community. The balance will be owned by Germany's credit
institutions.
At first glance, Mr Rolf Breuer's appointment as chairman-designate of the
Deutsche Borse - he is a main board director of the Deutsche Bank - might
suggest a victory for the large Frankfurt financial institutions over the
smaller banks and brokers.
It will suit the commercial aims of the larger institutions to have a more
centralised exchange, but the fact that the smaller exchanges have backed
the scheme as it stands shows that Mr Breuer has compromised enough to
assuage fears of domination by big banks and Frankfurt.
He has done this, in part, by a firm commitment to retain floor trading, in
Frankfurt and at the other seven exchanges. New technology, originally seen
as a threat to the smaller exchanges, has in fact worked to reduce tensions.
Ibis, the Frankfurt bourse's screen-based dealing system, has overcome
initial hostility from the seven smaller exchanges, and now provides a
significant part of their business.
The new Deutsche Borse has ambitious plans to introduce a fully-electronic
screen-based dealing system for the 30-50 most frequently traded equities
and bonds in three to four years' time. That will still leave many
securities traded only on the exchange floors, providing them with a
continued raison d'etre.
Mr Breuer said yesterday that the regional bourses and the Makler supported
the idea of a dual stock exchange: a network of electronic trading for a
'European League' of the most heavily traded company shares and bonds; and a
'regional league' of domestic securities with a strong regional connection.
The regional floors will be enhanced by providing them with electronic
support services.
Mr von Metzler claimed that the new arrangement will ensure that Germany has
one of the most sophisticated stock exchange structures in Europe. But he
acknowledges that there are still many challenges ahead. German capital
markets are underdeveloped, he says, reflecting the fact that bank finance,
not equity, has been the engine of post-war Germany.
Even now, there are only about 660 quoted companies on the German market,
representing a far smaller proportion of the country's economic output than
in the US or the UK.
Moreover, Germany's federal structure works against the speedy solution of
other issues. The lack of centralised regulation will not be solved without
haggling between Bonn and the governments of the Lander (states).
'We have established the groundwork for future developments,' says Mr von
Metzler. 'We have the structure, and now we have to fill it with life.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why the customer is
always right - Gary Mead finds agencies having a crisis of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The malaise of the UK advertising industry is firmly rooted in economic
recession. Since 1989, at least 2,500 jobs have disappeared, leaving a pool
of about 13,000 employed in the sector; as the recession continues, the fear
is that more redundancies are inevitable.
But not just redundancies. Last Friday, the Institute of the Practitioners
in Advertising (IPA) - the advertising agencies' trade association - staged
a lugubrious conference in London, under the rhetorical title, 'Are
Advertising Agencies History?'
The consensus was 'of course not'; but no real agreement emerged as to what
the future of advertising agencies might be.
The industry's flagging morale needs a boost. But against the background of
fewer jobs, frozen or reduced marketing budgets, squeezed commission rates
and no indication of an end to the recession, a dark cloud hung over the
IPA's 75th anniversary.
Yet within that broad gloom are contrary indicators, not the least being
Unilever's decision - made known to its advertising agencies last week -
that it is standardising its commission payments to advertising agencies at
13 per cent.
While that is 2 percentage points below the long-standing figure demanded -
but today rarely obtained - by advertising agencies, some agencies used by
Unilever around the world have seen commission rates forced as low as 6 per
cent.
It is most unusual for one of the world's largest marketing spenders - of
about Pounds 1.5bn annually, making it the largest advertiser outside the US
 -to make such a move. Unilever believes it could probably have forced rates
down to 11 per cent. It chose not to because it wished to be seen to
emphasise the importance it places on high quality advertising. Cheaper
commission rates would, Unilever believes, ultimately have meant poorer
quality advertising.
That signal of confidence in the role of big-spending advertising was
reiterated by Michael Perry, Unilever's chairman, who at the International
Association of Advertisers' conference in Barcelona on September 29, said:
'Advertising is at the very heart of our business. And you can be sure that
it will stay there.'
Such an opinion from such a company should hearten not just Unilever's
advertising agencies but those of other companies too.
But if Unilever has made a very public commitment to its own marketing
budgets, other companies - including Unilever itself - are privately much
less certain that they are getting value for money from their advertising
agencies, particularly in the field of press advertising.
The first findings of a continuing study by the Incorporated Society of
British Advertisers (ISBA), carried out in collaboration with the marketing
communications company, Advertising Research Marketing (ARM), suggests that
many ISBA members - companies which employ advertising agencies - are
thoroughly dissatisfied with their relationship with advertising agencies.
The study*, reflecting the views of 101 of ISBA's 750 member companies -
combined, the participants spend more than Pounds 280m annually in press
advertising - indicates that nearly three-quarters are highly concerned
about creative and production costs.
While they may have these concerns, some questions need also to be asked of
the advertisers themselves. Only 30 per cent of the companies receive
detailed invoices from their agencies. Invoices showing total bills only,
with no breakdown of the work done and what it cost, were received by 35 per
cent.
While 85 per cent of the surveyed companies obtain estimates for the
creative and production work from advertising agencies, only 20 per cent of
the survey seek comparative quotes from other agencies, 'putting those
companies who make proper use of estimating procedures in a position where
they may know the price of most services, but have little idea of the
relative value of what they are buying.'
John Orsmond, chairman of ARM, says: 'This compounds the confusion of
complexity, endemic to the industry's variable-cost conventions.'
Furthermore, the ISBA/ARM study suggests that the traditional means of
advertising agency remuneration - payment by percentage commission, usually
close to 15 per cent - has collapsed.
Just 49 per cent of the respondents now pay their agencies through the
commission system, the rest by forms of retainer and time fees or separate
charges, often stipulated by the client.
Ken Miles, director general of ISBA, says that the survey arose from
increased concern over press advertising production costs. 'A lot of
advertisers are finding print production costs rising rather rapidly and
they have very little idea of the real basis on which costs are placed and
some of them are rather doubtful of the value they are getting.'
According to Miles, there is a head of steam building up among companies
which, particularly in a recession, are increasingly focusing on advertising
costs. 'There is widespread agreement that the agency business is changing a
great deal. There is some question over whether agencies are constructing
charges in line with costs and traditional mark-ups, or whether they are
charging what the market will bear.'
One problem facing advertisers is the absence of industry-wide guidelines on
what press advertisements can, or should, cost. But while it is difficult,
companies such as ARM insist that it is possible for clients to find out
precisely what it is they are paying for.
By way of example, over the past 13 years ARM has developed fixed-cost
mechanisms for clients, as opposed to the industry norm of variable costs.
Miles says: 'I don't think there is a widespread set of circumstances in
which agencies are ripping off clients. Nevertheless, any client company
which doesn't bother to check is not doing their job very well.'
And when surprising bills do arrive, one of the first to suffer is the
reputation of the advertising agency; accounts are won on creativity but all
too often lost on administration.
ISBA/ARM's press inquiry is now moving into stage two, a detailed
examination of actual costs specific to each stage of the creative and
production process. The crucial stage three - a consideration of what to do
with the information obtained - will come much later.
Whatever the details of stage three, it is bound to signify yet another step
in the trend of relative power shifting from advertising agency to client.
While advertising agencies are far from being history, those that cannot
adapt to the new economic hard-headed attitude of clients may not have much
of a future.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Tensions rise as Savimbi returns to guerrilla base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUANDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jonas Savimbi, the hard-line leader of the Angolan rebel movement Unita,
left the capital Luanda yesterday, increasing fears that the country might
return to civil war.
His politically symbolic departure for Huambo - the southern provincial city
where he launched his pre-independence guerrilla struggle in 1975 - came as
efforts continued to save Angola's peace process. Unita claims that the
ruling MPLA's victory in the war-shattered country's first democratic
elections was fraudulent.
For 10 days, Mr Savimbi has been in virtual isolation at a villa in a
hilltop suburb of Luanda and has refused to meet all international
observers, including those from South Africa and the US, his former backers.
Last Saturday, he alleged the elections had been rigged and made a veiled
threat to plunge the country back into conflict. This week, former Unita
generals withdrew from the newly unified Angolan armed forces.
Western diplomats in Luanda have said that, if Mr Savimbi went to Huambo,
that would considerably increase fears of a return to violence and distance
Mr Savimbi further from negotiations to keep the peace process alive.
Huambo is the stronghold of Mr Savimbi's Ovimbundu tribe and a strategic
point if he means to launch a military challenge to the MPLA led by
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Mr Savimbi made Huambo his military base
in 1975 for his failed attempt to march on Luanda, with the backing of 5,000
South African troops.
Mr Nirberto de Castro, a senior Unita official who confirmed Mr Savimbi's
departure to Huambo, said last night: 'We do not want war but we do not fear
it.'
Other Unita officials tried to downplay Mr Savimbi's departure, saying that
he was going to consult his Unita colleagues and was escaping Luanda, where
he feared for his life. 'War is not the only option,' said Mr Jardo
Muekalia. 'There are many options we will pursue before we would even
consider going back to war. Nobody wants to fight again.'
Western observers were unsure whether the guerrilla chief was trying to turn
up the heat as a way to force the government to make concessions on the
elections and on power-sharing, or whether he was making tentative plans for
a return to civil war.
Angola's government said yesterday that Unita was welcome to join a
government of national unity if it accepted electoral defeat. The offer was
made in Lisbon by Mr Pedro van Dunem, Angola's foreign minister.
The conciliatory move came as the United Nations Security Council agreed to
send a committee of representatives of member states to Angola to join
international efforts to shore up the peace process.
There was no response from Unita to the offer and, despite Mr Savimbi's
departure, Unita officials in Luanda continued to work in four committees
set up by the National Electoral Committee to investigate the movement's
allegations of fraud.
As a concession to Unita, the announcement of final election results has
been postponed to the beginning of next week, after the investigation is
complete. Official returns more than 90 per cent complete show President dos
Santos leading Mr Savimbi by 50.8 per cent to 38.8 per cent.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Europe adds a fiscal choke to monetary grip: David Marsh on
the dangers of widespread budget squeezing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL OVER Europe governments are mounting a determined attack on budget
deficits. They are trying to convince the foreign exchanges of their
financial rectitude and prepare the way for non-inflationary growth.
The 1993 budget plans drawn up or under discussion in most European
Community and Nordic countries aim to dole out further doses of painful
medicine. The problem is that, labouring in a phase of economic doldrums and
high interest rates, Europe's finance ministries may be collectively
applying the fiscal brakes in the wrong way and at the wrong time.
Many individual government decisions - such as Germany's efforts to restrain
spending to finance German unification, or Italy's attempts at thoroughgoing
budgetary reform - are plainly necessary.
However, the cumulative effect of the budget pruning, ranging from large
cuts in social security to reduction in investment programmes, may tip
Europe towards a further growth slowdown next year.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg in London, estimates
the net contractionary effect of combined budgetary plans in nine European
countries (see table) represents 1 1/4 per cent of these nations' gross
domestic product.
The bank's calculations apply only to the 'discretionary' measures taken by
governments to reduce deficits through revenue increases or spending cuts.
They exclude the automatic increases in deficits caused by the effect of a
slowdown in growth, which depresses tax revenues and boosts pay-outs on
social security and unemployment.
Even if not all the measures announced during the last few weeks are put
into effect - an outcome which seems especially likely in Italy - Mr Magnus
is concerned that governments may be indulging in 'fiscal overkill'.
He warns: 'If private sector activity is going to be depressed for some
time, this is the wrong time to cut back spending in public investment.'
Mr Jonathan Wilmot of Credit Suisse First Boston in London worries that
Europe may be fighting 'deflation with deflation'. Because of the impact of
high capital market interest rates, Mr Wilmot points out that individual
efforts to cut deficits are often being counteracted by rising debt service
costs.
Mr David Hale of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services says that
governments which inflated their budget deficits in the first half of the
year to compensate for over-tight monetary policies are now seeking a return
to fiscal orthodoxy.
'This (cuts in budget deficits) is all right if you do it over three years.
But if you do it during just one year, you deepen recession,' he says.
Mr Hale expects that the Bundesbank - which has already started making
significant reductions in its money market interest rates - will decide
further interest rate cuts by Christmas. This will take some pressure off
European economies - but a 'weak 1993' is unavoidable, he says.
Mr Hans-Peter Frohlich, international economist at Institut der deutschen
Wirtschaft in Cologne, a business-orientated research institute, says most
European countries are embroiled in some form of asset price deflation. With
the private sector heavily constrained, fiscal contraction is being decided
'at the worst possible moment', he says.
'What we want is expansionary policies and a return to international policy
co-operation.'
Mr Frohlich points to the fundamental problem posed by German interest
rates. While the Bundesbank's monetary stance has caused difficulties for
the rest of Europe, premature action to lower German interest rates would
damage the German central bank's anti-inflation credibility - and would lead
to higher rather than lower D-Mark interest rates on the capital market.
European governments face a collective dilemma of not knowing when the
long-awaited upturn in economic activity will eventually arrive, says one
top international policy-making official.
Pointing to the risks that government could be pressed at the wrong time
into expansionary budget measures, he says: 'We're at precisely the moment
in the past when we've panicked - and we've found out later that the
recovery has already started.'
Partly because of the trauma caused by the last few weeks' currency
turbulence, European countries are sticking to 'safety first' in their 1993
budgets.
But, in trying to win the favour of the foreign exchange markets,
governments clearly face the risk that they will be ploughing collectively
not into recovery - but into recession.

rise by 12.6%

<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale de Surveillance, the Geneva-based international inspection
group, said its total fee income in the first eight months rose 12.6 per
cent and net income was comparable with the same period of last year. No
figures were given.
Of the growth in fee income, acquisitions accounted for 4 per cent and
foreign exchange 2.3 per cent.
The discrepancy between fee income and profit performance was due to a
setback in loss adjusting in the US and Australia because of mild weather. A
better result is expected in the final third of the year because of the
effects of Hurricane Andrew.
European markets, which account for nearly half of total fee income, grew
18.5 per cent. North America, which accounts for a quarter of fee income,
grew only at 1.9 per cent.
The Asia-Pacific region continued to grow at a strong 11.1 per cent, and the
company said that its important contract for pre-shipment inspection
services with the government of Indonesia had been renewed in July.

THE COVERAGE of Japan in many British national newspapers is negative and
biased with a heavy concentration on whale hunting, war atrocity and 'funny
Jap' stories, according to a new study published in the UK.
The fiercely competitive mass-market tabloids, with the exception of the
Daily Mirror, use 'viciousness, vacuity and sheer negative spitefulness in
their treatment of items on Japan' said the report sponsored by Andersen
Consulting, the management consultancy arm of UK auditors Arthur Andersen.
The survey by Professor Douglas Anthony, professor of Japanese studies at
Cardiff University, was based on a study of the national and regional press
from January to June 1991.
Prof Anthony said that the Daily Mirror was less culpable than The Sun or
the Daily Star.
The amount of Japanese coverage in the broadsheet papers was much greater
than in the tabloids but Japan was still given less attention than its size
merited.
The Financial Times had the most articles on Japan in the period - 639. The
study says such a high proportion of the FT's coverage was neutral it was
not worth making a full breakdown.

RAYTHEON, the New England-based defence business which makes the Patriot
missile, yesterday announced a 5.1 per cent rise in third quarter net
income, even though profits in its important electronics division were lower
than a year ago.
The company reported net income of Dollars 156.1m, or Dollars 1.16 a share,
compared with Dollars 148.4m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, in the same period of
last year, on sales of Dollars 2.2bn, down from Dollars 2.35m.
Electronics, which includes the Patriot missile and the company's largest
business, saw lower sales and profits, which the company said reflected the
timing of key production orders, including one pending from Saudi Arabia for
Patriot fire units and missiles.
However, Mr Dennis Picard, chairman and chief executive, said earnings

CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third-largest bank, said its revenue in the
first nine months was ahead of last year's level, and it expected net
profits for the year to be comparable with last year's record SFr848m
(Dollars 689.4m).
Although the slack demand for credit was hurting, commission income was
showing a marked rise. 'Swaps and derivative financial instruments again
account for a significant part of the increase in trading revenue,' said Mr
Robert Jeker, chief executive.
Mr Jeker warned that provisions for bad debts could be higher than last
year's SFr1.1bn because of the persistent weakness of the world economy, but
he said that Credit Suisse, the main subsidiary of CS Holding, was in 'a
very good position' with a capital ratio of 9.8 per cent under the Basle
norms.
He also quashed occasional speculation in Switzerland that the bank might
abandon the retail sector in its homecountry.
Mr Jeker said it was 'essential to maintain our strong position in the
retail banking sector'.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Recession fails to halt advance at Halstead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES HALSTEAD, the Manchester-based floor-coverings, weatherproof clothing
and trailers group, continued to defy the recession by posting a 5 per cent
improvement in full year pre-tax profits and by lifting its total dividend
by 6.7 per cent.
Pre-tax profits in the year to June 30 grew from Pounds 7.65m to Pounds
8.04m despite 'extremely severe' trading conditions which resulted in only a
modest increase in turnover to Pounds 58.9m (Pounds 58.3m).
Earnings per share rose to 37.71p (36.12p) and a recommended final dividend
of 7.5p (7p) makes a 12p (11.25p) total.
An extraordinary provision of Pounds 2.93m covered the costs of closing the
loss-making Belstaff garment manufacturing operations.
Mr Stephen Knight, finance director, said it had been a year of solid
achievement and consolidation for Polyflor, the group's core sheet vinyl and
tile floor-covering busi- ness which accounts for more than two thirds of
group turnover.
Trading conditions in the UK market remained 'unrelentingly harsh' and there
was some volume slippage. However, this was offset by improvement in the DIY
car- pet tile business and targeted growth in export sales. About a quarter
of output is now exported to 46 countries.
The group's Driza-Bone Australian weatherproof clothing business, acquired
three years ago, had a successful year, with a 'considerable' increase in
profit and turnover led by export sales which now account for 30 per cent of
its turnover.
Conway Products, which manufactures trailer-tents and other camping products
together with steel anti- vandal security cabins and industrial trailers,
managed to increase camping product sales in both the UK and Holland helped
by a new budget-priced trailer-tent model.
As expected, the Belstaff clothing business was closed after its losses
acceler- ated towards the end of last year.
However, the group set up Phoenix Distribution in February to continue sales
of motorcycle accessories including imported Metzler tyres from germany and
Aria helmets from Japan.
During the year the group spent more than Pounds 3m on capital investment,
mostly in the floor covering busi- ness, and further substantial investment,
funded from earnings, is planned over the next two years - mostly aimed at
maintaining product development and process capabilities in the flooring
business.
Despite the heavy level of investment and the cost of the Belstaff closure,
the group's strong positive cash flow enabled it to further strengthen its
balance sheet and end the year with no net borrowings.
A 1-for-1 scrip issue is proposed in order to bring the share capital more
into line with the rest of the balance sheet and improve market liquidity
for its shares which closed yesterday up 21p at 481p.
COMMENT
Halstead is a good, solid and safe investment in uncertain economic times,
but is unlikely to continue to outperform the market so spectacularly when
recovery comes. Its core vinyl flooring business faces growing competition
and margins are likely to come under increasing pressure, so promised new
PVC sheet flooring products will be crucial. Higher raw material prices are
likely following sterling's recent plunge, and the overseas manufacturers of
the group's motorcycle accessories are pushing for higher prices. But
Halstead's growing export business should help offset these pressures.
Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 8.4m are likely this year, producing
earnings per share of around 38p. Halstead is trading on a prospective p/e
of 12.6 and is a hold.

MR MICHAEL Smurfit, the chairman and chief executive of Jefferson Smurfit

5.6m of which had been acquired through the conversion last June of IPounds
9.8m of convertible unsecured loan notes.
Mr Smurfit said that he and his family continue to hold some 24m shares that
he is still the largest individual shareholder.
Proceeds from the sale of the shares will be used to repay borrowings made
to purchase the convertible loan stock in March 1989.
Early this week, after discussions with its bankers, the company's US arm

FT  08 OCT 92 / Sharp rise in German payment defaults
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG EVIDENCE of the deepening difficulties faced by German industry came
yesterday from Britain's leading private export credit agency, which
reported a 68 per cent increase in payment defaults by German importers of
UK products.
A survey by NCM Credit Insurance, which took over the short-term export
finance arm of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department early this
year, shows an increase of 26 per cent in the number of overdue accounts
reported by its 6,000 UK customers.
It blames the rise on deepening recession in many of Britain's leading
export markets. Problems are 'particularly worrying' in Germany, the study
says.
The 68 per cent rise in overdue accounts, comparing the first eight months
of 1991 with the same period this year, compares with a 53 per cent increase
in France, 52 per cent in Sweden, 35 per cent in Spain and 34 per cent in
Italy.
About 40 per cent of overdue accounts eventually become full defaults, but
NCM said yesterday that the trend for defaults was identical to that for
overdue accounts.
An official at the BDI, Germany's leading business body, said German
companies were being squeezed hard by high interest rates and the collapse
of the market in the east of Germany, as well as economic troubles in
leading export markets such as Britain, the US and France.
According to Mr John Price, one of the authors of the NCM study, most
defaults in Germany are being reported in the small electrical machinery
sector. By contrast, the textile sector is giving greatest problems in
Spain, Italy and Sweden, with clothing sector showing the most severe
problems in France.
The study argues that the recent devaluation will provide only a modest
fillip to UK exporters.
'Devaluation may help British exporters in terms of price, but as the
worldwide recession continues, it increases the risk of non-payment by
importers who find their own domestic economies suffering,' the study says.
The NCM analysis shows that over the past five years annual losses reported
by British exporters because of payment default have risen by 170 per cent.
Worst experiences have been in Spain and Italy.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Names expect report to boost fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL thousand Names at Lloyd's of London who were members of syndicates
formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency will learn of the reasons for
their multi-million-pound losses in the next few days.
Names were told yesterday that a Lloyd's investigation, or 'loss review'
report, into the losses of four Gooda Walker syndicates - numbers 164, 290,
298 and 299 - was being printed this week and would be dispatched to them
tomorrow. Names are the individuals whose assets support the Lloyd's market.
Gooda Walker syndicates' losses totalled Pounds 491m in 1989 alone, Lloyd's
latest reported year. The syndicates mainly specialised in spiral
reinsurance - reinsuring the catastrophe exposures of other Lloyd's
syndicates and insurance companies trading in London.
The syndicates were overwhelmed by claims arising from Hurricane Hugo in
September 1989, the European storms of January 1990 and other disasters.
The loss review report - 1,500 pages in three volumes - was prepared by a
committee chaired by Mr Kieron Poynter, a partner with accountancy firm
Price Waterhouse.
It is understood not to identify regulatory failures but Gooda Walker Names
are confident that it will help their campaign to win compensation.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said
last night he was confident the report would 'provide us with the questions
that we will have to ask'. He added: 'It's bound to be a good source book
even if it doesn't provide us with all the answers we need.'
Mr Doll-Steinberg said his group had recently appointed new solicitors Wilde
Sapte and a team of technical experts to assist its case.
A further loss review report on the syndicates formerly managed by the
Feltrim agency is also complete and will be sent to Names next week. That
report, prepared by a committee chaired by Sir Patrick Neill QC, is also
more than 1,000 pages long.

<TEXT>
COUNCILS face steep in-creases in insurance premiums as a result of the
demise of Municipal Mutual, the stricken insurer, a conference organised by
local-authority associations heard yesterday.
The increase could average at least 50 per cent from last year's estimated
total of Pounds 600m, according to the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities.
Nine out of 10 councils bought their insurance from Municipal Mutual, which
stopped writing new business and renewing existing policies last week.
Municipal Mutual is still seeking to sell its home, motor, life and health
insurance businesses and is again meeting claims after temporarily
suspending payments.
Mr Ken Kennedy, the risk and facilities manager with Surrey County Council,
warned the meeting that insurers would increase rates and 'saw councils as
ripe for the picking'.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Scots vote 'shows
backing for Union'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S distinctive identity and contribution to the United Kingdom must
be recognised, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, told a conference fringe
meeting of the Monday Club yesterday.
Mr Lang said that the general election, when the Conservatives gained two
seats in Scotland rather than losing several as predicted, had been a 'vote
of confidence' in the Union, but warned: 'Dissatisfaction with the Union is
likely to emerge once again if there is insufficient recognition of
Scotland's status as a nation.'
'Far too many people believe that the United Kingdom and England are
synonymous,' he said.
'Significant measures' to strengthen the union and Scotland's place in it,
together with a new approach to Scotland's government, would emerge from the
stocktaking of the Union promised during the election campaign, Mr Lang
said.
He ruled out a national assembly, but said reform of local government, with
the introduction of powerful single-tier authorities, was central to the
stocktaking process. The Scottish Office should play a more visible part in
Scottish life and become more accessible. The conclusions of the stocktaking
are expected in the next few months.
Mr Lang admitted mistakes had been made during the Thatcher era in the
government's relationship with Scotland. 'Perhaps we have not been
sufficiently active in addressing Scotland's different priorities,' he said.
'There is no point in importing policy for the sake of it. More policy
should be home grown in Scotland and policy must be right for Scotland,' he
added.
Mr Lang said he was awaiting findings of a feasibility study on Scottish
water privatisation before making a decision. But in his speech he hinted he
would not be put off by opinion polls showing that most Scots oppose water
privatisation.
'Policymaking by opinion poll doesn't work,' he said, and added: 'I am not
afraid of being unpopular.'

A proposed ADollars 2bn (Pounds 800m) private power station in Western

ABB was commissioned in June by the West Australia State Energy Commission

station. But the project depends on final agreement between ABB and the SEC.
Mrs Carmen Lawrence, Labor premier, has said the government would reject any

THE three largest US airlines have told the Bush administration that British
Airways should only be allowed to complete its proposed Dollars 750m
investment in Virginia-based USAir once an 'open skies' regime between the
US and the UK is fully operational.
The airlines' latest position is set out in a letter to Mr Jeffrey Shane, US
assistant secretary of transportation for policy and international aviation.
It comes as talks between the UK and US governments have just restarted in
Washington over possible revisions to the bilateral agreement which governs
aviation arrangements between the two countries.
The airlines - American, United and Delta, with Federal Express, the largest
overnight package delivery company - say they 'were advised that the
administration's goal. . . in the discussions is to obtain a commitment for
a phased-in open skies regime over a yet to be defined timetable.'
But, they continue: 'If a 'phase-in' to full 'open skies' is the only avenue
available, the US must ensure that the BA-USAir transaction can be
implemented in full no earlier than the completion of the 'phase-in'. The US
must maintain this leverage to protect its vital trade interests.'

REGISTRATION for candidates in Peru's congressional elections will close at
midnight tonight, three prominent parties having decided not to field
candidates. Peruvians will vote on November 22 for a new, 80-member
'democratic constituent congress'.
President Alberto Fujimori is hoping for a majority so as to continue
economic liberalisation and structural reform.
Also, the resumption of much-needed international financial assistance to
Peru, frozen since the president dissolved the previous Congress and
suspended the constitution on April 5, depends on a return to democracy.
The parties not fielding candidates argue that the new Congress, charged
with writing a new constitution, already has its hands tied by Mr Fujimori.
Opposition to his regime by former presidents Fernando Belaunde and Alan
Garca has ensured that their parties, Popular Action and Apra respectively,
will not run.
The right-wing Freedom movement of Mr Mario Vargas Llosa, defeated by Mr
Fujimori in the last presidential election, has also refused to participate.
MR Abimael Guzman, founder-leader of the Shining Path left-wing guerrilla
movement in Peru, was found guilty of treason and sentenced to life
imprisonment yesterday, after a 10-day summary trial by a closed court
martial at a naval base, agencies report from Lima.
He can appeal to a 'war council' and, if his conviction is upheld there, to
Peru's Supreme Military Court. President Alberto Fujimori has announced an
accelerated appeals procedure, to be completed within five days.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPPONENTS of Canada's proposed new constitution have opened a wide lead in
several key provinces, less than three weeks before a national referendum on
the constitutional package.
A Gallup poll published yesterday showed the No side backed by 53 per cent
of decided voters in British Columbia, 51 per cent in the three prairie
provinces and 46 per cent in Quebec. Support for the deal in these regions
is estimated at 30-36 per cent.
Doubts about the outcome of the October 26 referendum have already lifted
domestic interest rates and elicited warnings of further economic
turbulence. Mr Ted Newall, chief executive of Nova Corporation of Alberta,
one of the country's biggest energy and pipeline companies, warned on
Tuesday night that a No vote would mean, at best, five to 15 years of
economic and political uncertainty.
The constitutional package - the Charlottetown Agreement - is backed by all
three national parties, the leaders of all 10 provinces and the bulk of
Canada's business community.
They have been put on the defensive, however, by having to acknowledge that
the agreement is a compromise which gives no region or interest group
everything it wants.
Its critics - the most vociferous of whom include Quebec separatists,
western Canadian regional groups and women activists - have had the
advantage of highlighting the agreement's weaknesses.
The Yes side, which was slow to put its campaign into gear, expects to make
up ground over the next few weeks. It is taking comfort from the big
proportions of undecided voters - 22 per cent in Quebec and 17 per cent in
British Columbia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACCIDENT investigators yesterday recovered the 'black box' flight data
recorder from the El Al Boeing 747 cargo jet which crashed into two
Amsterdam housing blocks on Sunday, killing at least 250 people.
But Dutch officials warned that the flight recorder, which has been flown to
the Farnborough Accident Investigation Centre in the UK for decoding, was
badly damaged.
Investigators are hoping the device will provide some key data to pinpoint
the cause of the El Al disaster, although a Dutch transport ministry
official said they were 'rather pessimistic' on how much information it
would yield.
Piecing together the cause of the crash is proving extremely difficult.
Search teams have so far not found the separate cockpit voice recorder,
which could reveal the last conversations between the pilots before the
crash.
Adding to the investigators' difficulties, only one of the engines has been
found in a lake nine miles away from the crash site. This has raised the
possibility that earlier reports that both starboard engines had broken
loose from the aircraft were incorrect.
The Dutch transport ministry spokeswoman said the two large pieces of engine
found so far now appear to be two halves of the same outer starboard Pratt &amp;
Whitney engine. There was also no trace of fire. A spokeswoman for
Amsterdam's Schipol airport confirmed yesterday that three months ago the El
Al Boeing had reported an engine fire in mid-air during an incoming flight
to Amsterdam.
The Dutch government official said it was still too early to conclude that
only one engine had broken free. Investigators are using sonar equipment in
the lake where the engine pieces were found in case the second starboard
engine is there.
Original reports that both starboard engines had been torn away from the
aircraft suggested similarities with an accident in Taiwan last December
when a China Airlines 747 cargo aircraft, also powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines, crashed after losing its two starboard engines.
The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) said yesterday it planned to issue
soon an airworthiness directive to airlines to inspect possible defects in
the engine mounts on older versions of the Boeing 747 jets.
But the FAA said the order would have gone out regardless of the Amsterdam
crash, adding there was no direct evidence in the Amsterdam or the Taiwan
disasters pointing to the cause of either crash being the fuse pins
connecting the engine struts to the wings.
Boeing issued a formal notification to 747 operators to check fuse pins on
Monday but had already discussed the issue at a meeting with airline
customers last month.

FT  08 OCT 92 / US set to upgrade role in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is expected to provide crucial intelligence and other support to the
new United Nations forces due to be deployed to protect aid convoys in
Bosnia.
It is expected that US officers will join a headquarters operation drawn
largely from the existing structure of Nato's German-based Northern Army
Group.
The main US contribution on the ground would be a field hospital, but it is
thought Washington may also provide heavy transport aircraft to help with
the deployment.
The move is significant both for the US, in committing even limited numbers
of military personnel to former Yugoslavia, and for the UN, in extending the
scope of peacekeeping operations to include intelligence-gathering.
US participation is understood to have been sealed despite initial French
reservations. The force will be commanded by France's General Philippe
Morillon, with Britain providing the largest number of troops.
The UK is expected initially to send more than the 1,800 troops. Its
concerns about command and control arrangements in Bosnia have been met by
plans to transfer a 'core' headquarters operation from the Northern Army
Group. Germany, which is part of this Nato grouping alongside the UK,
Holland and Belgium, will not take part because of its constitutional
constraints. The gap will be filled by France and others.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (11): Hotel owners calculate carefully -
Tourism aims at quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR AUSTRIA'S ambitious tourism industry, a good year may not be good
enough.
After several years of rapid expansion in the number of visitors and in
tourism revenue, Austria's most important industry is expecting a
significant growth slowdown for 1992, primarily because of the world
recession.
Revenue from tourism will still reach a new record high, but hotel owners
and tour operators are talking about a crisis. 'The profitability of hotels
is very poor, it is a real problem both in the cities and the resorts,' says
Mr Michael Raffling, head of the hotel and restaurant section in the
Austrian chamber of commerce.
Following years of heavy investment in expanding and upgrading facilities,
many hotel owners are heavily indebted and are being hurt by high European
interest rates. Any difficulties filling beds are often solved by offering
heavy discounts on room prices, which tends to depress profits further, he
says.
'We are advising hotel owners to calculate carefully. We tell them not to
subsidise their guests,' Mr Raffling says. Instead, he says hotels could
attract more visitors by focusing on special groups such as skiers, golfers
or fitness fanatics, who are willing the pay the full price if their
interests are met.
Tourism experts who are not affiliated with the hotel industry do not see
any fundamental problems behind the growth slowdown. The extremely hot
weather in central Europe this summer has hurt some resorts because many
Austrians decided to stay at home while Germans went to the cooler Baltic
sea resorts, says Mr Paul Schimka, head of the tourism section in the
chamber of commerce.
The main cities of Vienna and Salzburg, where hotels rely heavily on US and
British visitors, had suffered a major setback last year because of the Gulf
war, and are only recovering modestly so far this year. Recession in the US
and Britain and the weak dollar are keeping those groups of tourists away,
Mr Schimka says.
But he expects the winter season to be very strong 'because last year's
heavy snowfall was the best advertisement we could get.'
Mr Egon Smeral, tourism forecaster at the Austrian Economic Research
Institute (WIFO), is expecting a revenue increase of 5 per cent or less from
the record ASch364bn earned from tourism in 1991. This is less than targets
set early in the year, but it will keep the country on a long-term growth
track well above its main European competitors.
'Austria is gaining market share,' Mr Smeral says. 'Last year, tourism in
Europe declined, and this year it is stagnating, but in Austria it is still
growing.'
The country continues to benefit indirectly from the war in what was
formerly Yugoslavia, because tourists who might have gone there go to
Austria instead. Reports of pollution in the Mediterranean may have also
worked in Austria's favour.
Austria is investing heavily in advertising, and a series of exhibitions on
the Hapsburg empire is generating good publicity as far as San Francisco and
Tokyo.
The number of overnight stays, which climbed 5.3 per cent to 130 million
last year, is likely to stagnate in 1992, but experts say this is no reason
to worry. The industry is focusing on quality rather than mass tourism, and
cheap private beds are quickly disappearing.
The opening of Eastern Europe has brought less of an influx of low-budget
tourists than many had expected. In the early days after the collapse of the
Berlin wall, hordes of tourists in rickety coaches would arrive in Vienna at
weekends for a look at the city's treasures and depart after spending almost
nothing. But both the coaches and the tourists' spending power have improved
significantly, tourism officials say.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (9): Klestil shocks Austrians as president
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR THOMAS KLESTIL, the former austere and thoughtful head of Austria's
diplomatic service, has surprised most Austrians by becoming an extremely
affable and outgoing president. According to one recent opinion poll, he has
displaced Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, as the country's most popular
public figure.
Mr Klestil succeeded the unfortunate Mr Kurt Waldheim in early July after an
unexpected election victory. He was Austrian ambassador to the US from 1982
to 1987 - it was noted in his presidential campaign brochures that he knew
US president George Bush as George.
Mr Klestil has put his prestige and popularity behind the campaign to win
public support for EC entry.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (10): Scandal's solace - Wine climbs
slowly back to respectability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENTION Austrian wine, and the first thing people think of is the scandal
that broke out in 1985, when it was discovered that unscrupulous traders
were lacing their products with diethylene glycol, better known as
antifreeze.
Besides being the source of many sour jokes, this scandal - which came to
light when a dealer tried to claim for the chemical in his tax return - had
a devastating effect on exports of Austrian wine. From 478,000 hectolitres
in 1984, the volume tumbled to a low 36,000 hl in 1988. Value dropped from
ASch440m to ASch90m over the same period.
Curiously, the scandal had virtually no impact on domestic consumption,
which helped cushion the blow, since more than 90 per cent of output is
consumed internally.
The industry is still not even close to recovering its pre-scandal export
volume, but today Austrian wine producers and merchants are inclined to be
grateful that it all happened.
'Looking back, we can be very happy that it was so severe,' says Mr Fritz
Ascher, export marketing manager of the country's wine industry promotion
agency. 'We would not have been able to push through new quality control
laws if this had not happened.'
The promotion agency has even taken to using the scandal as a marketing
tool. Until two years ago, it tried to downplay it, referring to it in
official documents only in euphemistic terms. But a new brochure featuring
the 2,700 year history of Austrian viticulture highlights the scandal as one
of the great milestones of the industry's development, alongside Charlemagne
laying down viticultural guidelines around the year 800, and the
introduction of the Riesling grape in 1301.
Austria is not a traditional wine exporter. Although wines have been made in
the country for nearly 3,000 years, it has been mainly for the modest home
market. Even today, Austrian annual production of some 2.8m hectolitres
ranks it 18th in the world, far behind the Italian and French giants, each
with 60m hl a year.
Even when exporting began in earnest in the 1970s, Austria became known as a
supplier of cheap and cheerful sweetened white wines, mainly to Germany. But
after the scandal that niche was effectively closed. The only possible
salvation was to emphasise quality rather than quantity, and to certify it.
Today, Austrian wine bottles of Gruner Veltliner and Blaufrankisch are a bit
like aero-engine components - each one is individually labelled and numbered
so that its origin can be traced precisely.
Still, the climb back to respectability has not been easy. Producers have
deliberately advanced slowly, trying first to establish credibility in
speciality shops and good restaurants. Progress shows in a steadily rising
volume since 1988 to 220,000 hl last year. Average export prices have more
than doubled since before the scandal, from ASch10.5 per litre in 1984 to
ASch26 last year, reflecting the gradual shedding of the scandal stigma.
Last year, for the first time since the scandal, Austrian producers began
selling to supermarkets, notably Tesco and J Sainsbury in the UK. 'Only
since 1991 can we say that there is a good distribution of Austrian wines
again in foreign countries,' Mr Ascher says.
So far this year, the progress is continuing, with a handsome 30 per cent
rise in volume (21 per cent in value) in the first half. The industry's
objective is to maintain its export growth rate of about 25 per cent a year
until volume is back again to the 400,000 hl a year level. Because there is
still a lot of education to do, it is concentrating only on a few large
markets.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (8): In a class by himself - Eric Frey
examines the political talents of Mr Jorg Haider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG Europe's new crop of right-wing populists, Austria's Mr Jorg Haider is
in a class by himself.
Better than any Franz Schoenhuber in Germany or Jean-Marie Le Pen in France,
the leader of the Austrian Freedom Party (FPO) has managed to spread his
xenophobic and anti-establishment message and still stay in the political
mainstream and maintain respectability.
By tapping adroitly into Austrians' growing frustration with the blatant
patronage practised by the two main political parties, the Social Democratic
Party (SPO) and the conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP), Mr Haider
has brought the FPO's share of the vote from about 5 per cent six years ago
to nearly 20 per cent - and made his party the leading force on the right in
Carinthia and in Vienna.
With his endless attacks on established institutions and personalities, he
dominates Austrian politics and forces the other parties on to the
defensive. The press is constantly analysing, criticising or commending Mr
Haider's statements, offering him a steady flow of publicity.
Even his enemies admit that Mr Haider is a unique political talent. Full of
boyish charm and eloquence, the 42-year-old lawyer seems to find the
appropriate words for almost every audience. At times he hints at an
affinity to some Nazi ideas and policies, especially in Carinthia where
nationalist feelings are strong. Last year he referred to deserters of the
Wehrmacht as national traitors. But he emphasises his party's liberal
programme in front of the national audience.
The inconsistencies in his statements are reported in the press, but do not
seem to bother the voters. Even his recent vacillating on the question of
Austria joining the EC appeared not to have dented his popularity. After
calling for years for a quick entry into the EC, Mr Haider jumped on the
growing anti-Maastricht bandwagon in August and suddenly declared his
opposition to the Community.
In a lecture series in several German towns, in front of cheering, mostly
right-wing crowds, he warned of the Brussels juggernaut and the 'European
standard man.' When grumbling in his own party about this volte-face become
too loud to ignore, he changed course again and reaffirmed his commitment to
the EC.
Some political analysts, seizing on his remark that Austria is 'an
ideological abomination,' wonder if he is a true Germanic nationalist or
just an opportunist playing with nationalist sentiments still prevalent in
Austria. While the FPO chairman often condemns the crimes of the Third
Reich, in spontaneous remarks he veers dangerously close to Nazi rhetoric,
which has tended to hurt his political career.
His praise for the 'proper employment policies of the Third Reich' during a
heated debate in the Carinthian assembly in June 1991 was clearly provoked
and instantly rescinded. But it gave his coalition partners the opportunity
to force him out of the governor's chair where, by all accounts, he had been
extremely effective.
Political analysts are also uncomfortable with his use of aggressive
phrases, such as 'eradication of venom'. Since taking over the party
leadership in an internal coup d'etat in 1986, he has ruthlessly purged the
party of opponents or independent thinkers.
Following a policy confrontation in February, the party chairman, Mr Norbert
Guggerbauer, and the deputy leader, Mr Georg Mautner-Markhof, resigned. Last
month, Mr Ludwig Rader, the party's leader in Steyrmark, was expelled after
criticising Mr Haider's behaviour.
Mr Haider has tried, unsuccessfully so far, to lure the conservative OVP
away from its uneasy coalition with the Social Democrats. But his party is
still gaining new voters, mostly among workers and small shopkeepers. The
influx of refugees from Eastern Europe and former Yugoslavia has given it
new momentum.
The established parties have found no effective recipe against his appeal.
Mr Haider repeatedly asserts that he will be chancellor within six years.
And if any of Europe's populist right-wingers have a chance to come to
power, it looks as if it could be him.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (7): 'Interpretation of neutrality' - Mr
Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, interviewed by Ian Rodger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUESTION: A year ago, you said the European Community was not to be
criticised too much for its clumsiness in responding to the Yugoslav crisis.
Do you still feel that way?
Answer: It is still true that the instruments embedded in the Treaty of Rome
and other regulations were not meant to cope with a crisis like that in
Yugoslavia. But I also think that the will to end the shooting there has
turned out to be rather underdeveloped.
Q: You have favoured applying economic sanctions against Serbia. Do you
still think they can work?
A: One cannot give a very strong report about the working of sanctions so
far. There has been some debate about our sending customs officers on a
voluntary basis to one or two countries bordering Serbia. In the meantime,
the security council of the UN came to the conclusion that there should be
military assistance accompanying the humanitarian assistance, and I think
this is a method which should be adopted.
Q: How do you feel western Europe has handled the Yugslavian refugee crisis?
A All west European countries in one way or another have their hands full
dealing with large increases in international migration. Perhaps other
western Europeans showed too little readiness to accept that there is an
extraordinary situation in Bosnia, and that actually a large number of
individuals either had to leave their homes because of the shooting or were
forced out by those who thought that 'ethnic cleansing' could be achieved.
Q: How worried are you about a deterioration in stability in eastern Europe
if western Europeans do not substantially increase their aid?
A: I see a very close connection between economic developments and political
developments in eastern European countries. They need western help in
developing their economies. On their own, they will not be able to reach
success. I disagree with those who advocate a wait and see attitude,
recommending to east Europeans that they should first develop market
economies and then there will be cooperation. They will not be able to
develop any kind of free market system without western assistance. I also
think that western economic cooperation will have to serve as one of the
main elements to develop political stability in these countries. Western
European peace and stability could themselves be jeopardised if
destablisation develops more in eastern Europe. We see a lot of indicators
of destabilisation there.
Q: How important is the outcome of the debate over the Maastricht treaty for
Austria?
A: It has quite some significance. It has become a fashion in Europe to be
more critical towards the EC than a couple of years ago. Fashions never
develop by themselves, they need creators. So I think that the discussions
within a number of Community member countries in which people are being more
critical towards the EC, and especially towards Maastricht, influences the
psychology here. People here keep saying that if even Community members are
doubtful, why should we be so positive?
Q: How do you feel about Maastricht?
A: The next steps in European integration - namely, arriving at political
union and monetary union - are necessary in order to strengthen the idea of
Europe of the future. It is very odd that on the one hand people wish Europe
to be a strong power and to have a stronger capacity to intervene in, say,
Yugoslavia, and on the other hand they are against the Maastricht treaty.
Q: If ratification is delayed, will it have an impact on Austria's
application to join the EC?
A: We have been told that we should prepare for a delay in our entry
negotiations if Maastrict is not ratified. In this event, we would try
everything to convince the EC people that they should enter into
negotiations with us anyhow.
Q: Is Austria's neutrality an obstacle to entry?
A: I have advocated a modern interpretation of neutrality. We cannot and
will not base our foreign policy on a framework that existed in Europe in
the 1950s and 1960s. We will commit to full cooperation on the basis of the
Maastricht treaty, but this is not a contradiction in principle to the
status of neutrality.
Q: The election of Mr Thomas Klestil, a conservative, as president, has made
people wonder if the coalition between your party and the conservative
Austrian People's party will last through until the next election in 1994.
A The presidential election was certainly a setback for my party, but I do
not think it was more than just that. And there is no reason whatsoever to
end the present government coalition prematurely, especially when you
consider that Mr Haider's party (Mr Jorg Haider is leader of the radical
liberal Freedom Party of Austria) is becoming more and more unpredictable on
European integration and in dealing with right wing views and opinions. It
also seems that Haider's influence on the party is no longer the only one
deciding the party's general view.
Q: There is talk of a People's Party-Freedom Party coalition.
A: I do not see a real chance of changes in the political landscape. Of
course democracy - fortunately so - can be a very dynamic phenomenon, but I
think the next moment to get a more precise picture of the Austrian
political scene will be the election in 1994.
Q: Opposition parties complain that you are dragging your feet on
privatisation.
A: There are some people here who always label themselves as free marketeers
and free enterprise people, and at the same time they wish to push the
finance minister into selling shares at a time at which the stock exchange
is at an historic low. The finance minister would be criticised if he sold
shares at a time when he would not get a good price. There is also the
question of the difficulties of Austrian Industries. What kind of dividend
expectation could you offer to a potential investor in selling equity of a
company that would not get out of the red for the forseeable future?

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria 3: Voters turned more thoughtful - Ian
Rodger reviews a political scene very different since the presidential
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNEXPECTED triumph of Mr Thomas Klestil in last spring's presidential
election campaign may turn out to be a watershed in Austrian politics.
It was certainly an illustration of thoughtful voting - something for which
Austrians had not hitherto been noted. It may mark the beginning of a
recovery of the fortunes of the conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP).
And it has already made life more complicated for the democratic socialist
chancellor, Mr Franz Vranitzky.
Because the former president, Mr Kurt Waldheim, was unable to fill many of
his roles, Mr Vranitzky has effectively been both president and chancellor
for the past five years. Now, suddenly, there is a real president expressing
opinions, making speeches, visiting refugee camps and hobnobbing with
foreign dignitaries. And it is not the president that Mr Vranitzky wanted.
The chancellor had backed Mr Rudolf Streicher, a fellow socialist and former
transport minister, in the election.
In the first few weeks after Mr Klestil, a conservative, moved into the
sumptuous Hofburg palace, the chancellor was looking distinctly out of
sorts, prompting the media to speculate on what one magazine called
Vranitzky-dammerung (the twilight of Vranitzky).
According to Conservatives, it is not only the presence of Mr Klestil that
depresses the chancellor, but also the whole political outlook. Mr Vranitzky
has had a fairly easy ride since his party's strong showing in the 1980
election, facing few really tough decisions and knowing in any event that
his opponents were in disarray. Opinion polls have consistently shown him to
be the most popular politician in the country, and he has presided over the
nation's affairs rather like an avuncular chairman.
Now he faces a tough two years until the next general elections, filled with
no-win legislation such as cutting taxes on the rich and reducing state
pension benefits and raising the retirement age for all.
Meanwhile, the hitherto divided and moribund OVP has a new sense of purpose
following Mr Klestil's victory. The party has followed up by electing the
attractive Mr Bernhard Gorg to lead it back to respectability in the city of
Vienna. In last November's city election, the OVP was knocked into third
place by the fast rising Austrian Freedom Party (FPO), led by Mr Jorg
Haider.
Mr Gorg is widely seen as a potential successor to Mr Erhard Busek, the
latest in a succession of rather colourless OVP national leaders.
The most sanguine Conservatives talk of forming an alliance with the FPO to
displace the national coalition government. The OVP has become increasingly
uncomfortable as the the junior partner to Mr Vranitzky's Democratic
Socialist Party (SPO) since 1986. 'Austria has missed the great conservative
trend of the 1980s,' one veteran OVP member says wistfully.
At the moment, an OVP-FPO coalition is not an option, as the SPO has 80
seats, the OVP 60, the FPO 33 and the greens 10 in the federal parliament,
but it could be possible after the next election.
Many - perhaps most - conservatives would not contemplate an alliance with
the FPO as long as Mr Haider, a controversial populist, was at its head. But
they seize hope from the fact that Mr Haider has had to contend with growing
dissatisfaction in his party over his purges of internal opponents and his
oscillation on various policy issues. On the other hand, an FPO without Mr
Haider in charge might lose so much popular support as to be of little use
as a coalition partner.
It was noticeable that Mr Vranitzky returned from his summer holidays last
month looking refreshed and more confident than for some time. Some
observers say he may not be that upset after all that Mr Streicher was
beaten in the presidential election. Mr Streicher, who has since left
politics to become chairman of Steyr-Daimler-Puch, was the most likely
challenger within the SPO to the chancellor.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (4): Equity is in short supply -
Structural problems bedevil the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'AUSTRIA - a time to be buying,' cried the headline of a bullish study on
the Austrian stock market published at the end of August by US investment
bank Morgan Stanley.
Coming after two years of sharp declines in volumes and prices, this was
something that market participants wanted to hear. The report flashed
through Vienna's depressed financial community at facsimile machine speed.
More important, the leaders of the financial community have finally got
together to address the not inconsiderable structural problems that bedevil
the market. Now that Vienna has a chance of becoming a serious regional
financial centre in a rejuvenated central Europe, there is a greater sense
of urgency about addressing these problems.
A few days ago a high powered committee chaired by the finance minister met
for the first time with a mandate to put things right. The main problem is
an inadequate supply of equity. Trading volume in the 10 leading shares in
the first half of 1992 amounted to only ASch47.1bn. The market is open for
only three hours a day and only 18 shares are continuously quoted.
Supply is hindered by the fact that many of the largest companies in Austria
are state owned. The borse would like to see the process of privatisation,
which has seen half a dozen companies come to market in recent years,
speeded up.
The government is also looking seriously at a change in the tax system that
would encourage owners of companies to come to the market. At the moment,
wealth tax is a deterrent to them, because it is paid on market value of
quoted companies but only an assessed value on private companies. This
change is on the agenda for the next important tax overhaul, scheduled for
the end of next year.
There are also problems on the demand side. General insurance companies are
allowed to invest only 5 per cent of their liability funds in equities. And,
because the government provides very generous pensions to all citizens,
there are very few private pension funds in the country.
Individuals have little experience of investing in equities, prefering to
stuff their savings into anonymous savings accounts which are taxed at only
10 per cent. The government intends to raise the tax to about 20 per cent
next year, which could make equities look more attractive.
The borse has become infamous lately for insider scandals. Within the past
year there have been two cases of substantial trades taking place in advance
of a company announcing a serious deterioration of its profits.
At the moment, insider trading is not a criminal offence. The borse has no
effective means of enforcing its regulations on members. The government
intends to amend the borse law later this year to make insider trading a
criminal offence, but both bankers and government officials are sceptical
about eliminating insider action so long as the number of participants in
the market is so small.

IT HAS been a dreadful year for Austrian banks so far, with little prospect
of any relief in the second half.
But the one benefit is that the on again-off again process of reducing the
ridiculous levels of overcapacity in the industry seems to be perking up.
For the record, there are 1,165 banks in Austria today, down by 144 in the
past decade.
Profits of all the leading banks were well down in the first half, as high
interest rates squeezed already wafer thin spreads between borrowing and
lending. The stock market remained in the doldrums.
Partial operating profit (pretax profit, excluding exceptional items) of
Bank Austria, the bank formed by the merger a year ago of Zentralsparkasse
and Osterreichische Landerbank, tumbled 15.7 per cent to ASch815m.
Creditanstalt, the number two bank, which did not have exceptional merger
expenses to deal with, saw its partial operating profits drop 9.5 per cent
to ASch845bn.
Giro's main traditional business has been investing funds that savings banks
must by law deposit with it. But the savings banks are gradually being freed
to invest where they like, and realise they can get better returns in the
open market than with Giro.
The earnings squeeze on the banks appears finally to have forced them to
abandon the frantic battle for market share that has characterised the
sector in recent years. Bank Austria, exercising its new role as market
leader, raised its lending rates after the German Bundesbank hikes in July,
and others duly followed. Customer charges have been increased.
All the banks talk about cutting costs, and Bank Austria executives are
pretty well decided to cut about 60 branches out of their merged 360 total
over the next couple of years. it is probably significant that the merger
that created Bank Austria has concentrated market shares.
Also, the banks are increasingly worried about foreign competition. German
banks in particular have become more active in the Austrian securities
market, bankers say.
Medium term, the anticipated raising of withholding tax on savings accounts
and the outlawing of anonymous accounts could cause a significant outflow of
funds from the banks. Austria now has one of the highest savings rates in
the world, nearly 14 per cent of net disposable income.
As for further restructuring in the banking industry, Giro is the subject of
most speculation these days. Because its natural franchise is fading, Giro
has been trying to build up its own network of branches.
The snag is that the two largest shareholders in Giro are Bank Austria and
Erste Osterreiche Spar-Casse-Bank. With their own savings bank networks,
they appear to have joined forces to try to prevent Giro from becoming more
powerful.
Negotiations on a merger between Erste and Giro came to nought last year,
but they could be revived in the future. Or Giro could be gobbled up
eventually by Bank Austria.
There was speculation in Vienna last month that Bayerischen Landesbank, the
large Bavarian savings bank, would take a 10 per cent stake.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (3): Exports prove resilient - Nicholas
Denton reviews the economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIENNA'S economic policymakers, like the well-ordered and bourgeois city
they live in, attract one description above all others: smug.
Fluent and confident when reciting Austria's catalogue of economic
achievement, they have to stop and think hard to come up with any flaws.
There is good cause, however, to be satisfied. Austria has remained a
charmed island of prosperity and stability.
At no time was that clearer than when the European exchange-rate mechanism
splintered - and the Austrian schilling actually rose against the German
D-mark to which it has been tied for 20 years.
The confidence of the foreign exchanges is firmly grounded in economic
fundamentals. Austria's combination of economic indicators is arguably the
most favourable in the developed world, winning much praise from the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in its latest annual
report on the Austrian economy.
After growth which, over the last three years, has outstripped that of every
other OECD member, the economy looks likely to dodge recession altogether.
The Austrian Institute of Economic Research (Wifo) has predicted that gross
domestic product (GDP) will expand by 2.2 per cent this year and 3.0 per
cent in 1993. An expected downward revision in this forecast will still see
growth most west European countries would envy.
Growth seems well clear of constraints. Although consumer price inflation
has risen one percentage point to the 4 per cent level since the end of last
year, the rate appears to have peaked. And, despite the fact that Austria is
growing faster than its trading partners, the current account remains in
rough balance.
The budget balance remains under control too, steadied by unexpectedly
robust tax revenues. The government forecasts a deficit of 3.0 per cent of
GDP this year, falling gradually to 2.5 per cent in 1994.
That represents a slippage on earlier plans, earning some rare criticism
from the OECD. But the Austrian National Bank stresses that Austria is
meeting the European convergence criteria - there are few countries which
can boast that.
However, it has to be said that there is increasing support for the view
that Austria's economic existence cannot remain charmed forever.
'For the first time my feeling is that it cannot go on,' says Mr Johann
Fernleiter, deputy secretary general of the Federal Economic Chamber, the
employers' organisation which is calling for a zero pay round this year.
But the mood remains sanguine. 'If there is a soft landing it will be very
soft,' says Mrs Maria Schaumayer, the president of the Austrian National
Bank. Even that judgement might be on the pessimistic side. Austria's chief
central banker goes on to assert that the economy will altogether avoid
collision with the ground.
So what gives Austria's economy its buoyancy?
On the side of domestic demand, consumer spending and construction
investment have given lift. Retail trade, held up by gently rising real
incomes and a fall in the household savings rate, grew 3.25 per cent in the
first half. Meanwhile the building industry, enjoying a record boom and
still working on a backlog of orders, is set to grow by 5.5 per cent this
year.
But the key to sustained growth has been the resilience of Austria's export
growth, albeit at a reduced rate, in the face of global slowdown.
First came expansion and infrastructure spending after reunification in
Germany, Austria's largest trading partner. Austria rode Germany piggy-back,
increasing exports without having to fund reconstruction of the east.
Now, as Germany fades, succour is coming from an unexpected source - eastern
Europe. Deliveries to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland exploded to 24 per
cent in the year to the first half, helping total exports to grow 5 per
cent.
With an economic formula as winning as Austria's, it is a wonder that anyone
should want to tinker. Indeed, Austrian policymakers are very cautious about
structural change.
But the outside world is forcing a faster pace.
Austria's desire to join the European Community dictates that the government
removes much of the protection behind which many industries have sheltered.
Above all, Austria's system of agricultural subsidies - so overblown that it
attracted a special, critical mention in the OECD report - must be reworked.
'Convergence gives us a push to liberalise - and do it more rapidly,' says
Mr Peter Henseler of the finance ministry's European integration department.
'It is like a fresh wind which blows into old rooms.'
Another impetus for reform is coming from the encroaching globalisation of
capital markets. Domestic investors are diversifying into foreign currency
holdings but at the same time foreign investors have lost interest in
Austrian sluggish markets.
The resultant outflow of long-term capital is unbalancing the market and
putting upward pressure on interest rates, according to Mr Johann Maurer,
economic analyst at Creditanstalt Bankverein.
That leads a growing number of policymakers and observers to argue for
reform to increase the supply of stocks and attract foreign investors back
to the market. One change which is being actively considered is to change
wealth taxation so that it does not penalise the owners of private companies
when they go public.
Looking further ahead, it is perhaps the opening up of eastern Europe which
will have the most violent impact on the economy.
To date Austria has clearly benefited from growing trade with its eastern
neighbours. Exports have risen faster than imports; and estimates of the
number of jobs which will be lost in the foreseeable future as a result of
eastern competition range from a negligible 20,000 to a manageable 100,000.
But already the food, cement, agricultural machinery, textiles and leather
industries are suffering from cheap eastern imports. And the challenge is
just beginning.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (2): A certain confidence - The start of
EC entry negotiations and the challenges posed by changes in eastern Europe
make this a milestone year for Austria. Prosperity and stability continue,
but there are signs of economic slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE may be in rather short supply in most of Europe these days, but
Austria is full of it.
The country's economy remains relatively robust, its renewed ties with
eastern Europe are proving more profitable than expected, its handling of
the crisis next door in the Balkans has been sensitive and its creaking
political structure looks set for an overhaul.
'Growth has been slowing down,' says Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the
Austrian National Bank. 'But I do not see even a soft landing. I think we
can steer safely away from the peaks and trees.'
The country certainly steered clear of last month's turmoil in European
currency markets, thanks mainly to its policy of pegging the schilling to
the D-mark. And it appears that the economy will grow at 2.5 per cent this
year, and about 3 per cent next year, after 3 per cent last year.
Perhaps the one significant obstacle is the turmoil over the future of the
European Community. Austria, which applied to join the EC three years ago,
was hoping that formal negotiations on this would start early next year. In
the wake of the debacle over the Maastricht treaty and the breakdown of the
European monetary system, it is no longer clear when negotiations can begin
or where they will go.
A long needed political renewal was signalled in June with the unexpected
election of Mr Thomas Klestil, a former diplomat, as the country's new
president.
The election itself was a welcome milestone, at last bringing to an end the
sorry term of Mr Kurt Waldheim, the former United Nations secretary general.
Questions about Mr Waldheim's war record made it impossible for him to carry
out his largely ceremonial role, and paralysis in the political system made
it impossible to get rid of him.
But the fact that Mr Klestil - a little known figure with no political
experience - was elected confirmed other indications of significant changes
in Austrians' political behaviour. In the first ballot in April, Mr Klestil
was placed a surprisingly strong second among four candidates. He then
romped home in the run-off against the Democratic Socialist favourite, Mr
Rudolf Streicher, the former transport minister, selected by Mr Franz
Vranitzky, the Chancellor.
Austria's political scene in the post-war period has been characterised by a
self-serving sharing of power between the conservative Austrian People's
Party (OVP) and the Democratic Socialist party (SPO). Voter loyalty was
assured by a sharing of patronage, extending throughout the public service -
it was supposed to be the socialists' turn this year to pick the president -
and the huge nationalised industries.
Now, even though the patronage system lives on, voters apparently no longer
feel bound by it. 'Austrian voters have become more flexible,' says Mr Jorg
Haider, the controversial leader of the Austrian Freedom Party (FPO). 'From
now on, any result is possible in an election.'
Mr Haider, a self-professed populist who has achieved notoriety both at home
and abroad for expressing right wing views, has recognised that the
hypocrisy of the so-called black-red coalition is a popular theme with
voters, and he jumps on every opportunity to attack it.
This year, his main target has been the central bank, long a highly paid
retreat for worthies from both main parties. The SPO benefits additionally,
by owning 5 per cent of the bank's shares.
Mrs Schaumayer, whose own salary of more than ASch5m a year (even after a
voluntary 30 per cent cut) has figured prominently in Mr Haider's attacks,
grits her teeth at the mention of his name. 'Salary levels are high, and
they should be better in line with the banking business,' she admits, but
she says that reforms had begun before Mr Haider began shouting.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter, Mr Haider has gained grudging
approval, even from those who would never think of voting for him, for
bringing attention to this and other examples of privilege. Many people
think he will be the one actually to break the red-black mould. His own view
is that he could become chancellor after the 1998 election.
Mr Haider has also drawn attention to himself for apparently changing his
view on Austria's entry into the European Community. From having been an
unconditional supporter of entry, he suddenly announced in late August that
it was a bad idea. Cornered on this apparent flip-flop, he said he was still
in favour but would impose some conditions. Pressed further, he said the
problems were on the Austrian side, not the EC side.
Critics saw it as a typical attempt by the Freedom Party leader to
capitalise on a current trend - in this case, towards increasing doubt about
the EC among Austrian voters, and opponents have used this to claim that Mr
Haider is an unreliable opportunist. Mr Vranitzky says Mr Haider is becoming
'more and more unpredictable,' and suggests that he may even be losing his
hold over his party.
The EC has lost credibility in Austria in the past year as a result of its
dithering over the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. According to one recent
poll, little more than a third of Austrians saw the EC as a good thing.
Austrian leaders, on the other hand, believe that the Yugoslav crisis has
shown clearly the need for more integration of European foreign policy along
the lines proposed in the Maastricht treaty.
Austrians are quietly proud of their own handling of the Yugoslav crisis,
having taken in far more refugees per capita than any other western European
country. To date there has been no sign of the severe social strains that
appeared in Germany in recent months. About three quarters of the refugees
are staying in private homes, so there is no provocative concentration of
them.
Austrian diplomats despair of any early settlement of the conflict, although
they feel the UN is on the right path following the London conference last
month. They are now spending considerable effort trying to discourage
hotheads in other neighbouring eastern European countries from resorting to
force. Mr Ernst Sucharipa, head of the political section in the foreign
ministry, says: 'We point out to them that if they want to join the Council
of Europe, then certain standards on minority rights have to be observed.'
Austria's rapidly growing trade with eastern Europe remains one of the
brightest spots in its remarkably resilient economy. This trade now accounts
for 11 per cent of gross domestic product compared with only 8 per cent
before Comecon collapsed, and reflects the ease with which Austrian
businessmen can move in the countries of the former Austro-Hungarian empire.
Still, the economy is slowing down, and with a general election now less
than two years away, some of the more politically sensitive items on the
government's agenda may fall by the wayside.
Some reform of the country's capital markets is on the way, notably to clamp
down on insider trading and perhaps to encourage more companies to come to
the stock market.
But the government's ambitious privatisation programme is in trouble, partly
because of the depressed state of the stock market, but also because of huge
losses at Austrian Industries, the main candidate for privatisation.
It all points to a rather choppy period in Austrian public life in the
run-up to the next national elections in 1994 but, as Mrs Schaumayer might
say, the country will undoubtedly continue to avoid any really dangerous
rocks or trees.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (14): Rapidly expanding group - Profile of
FLS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLS, Denmark's largest industrial conglomerate, is something of a mystery.
With more than 20,000 employees and an annual turnover of DKr12.6bn, the
group is market leader in some of its sectors, yet remains largely unknown
in the wider world.
Part of the reason for its obscurity is the unusual range of industrial
areas in which FLS operates. For example, the group's largest activity is
cement manufacturing equipment, a sector in which it is world leader,
enjoying between 50 to 60 per cent of the market.
Most of its remaining operations emanate from this core business.
Environmental services, building materials, packaging, and services such as
freight forwarding and finance all derive from the cement equipment
business.
The group has been expanding rapidly. Since 1987, FLS sales have more than
doubled, assisted by a massive annual investment programme of DKr1.4bn spent
on capital projects and acquisitions.
Recently, however, FLS has made a strategic move away from its core area,
diversifying into the aerospace sector and raising the profile of the
company.
The diversification follows a restructuring of the group, boosting
efficiency and generating the necessary cash-flow to move into the new area.
Mr Birger Riisager, president and chief executive, explains: 'FLS in the
early 1980s was a large group with a parent company that just wasn't on its
toes. It was incapable of working out where it was making and losing money.'
In 1987 headquarters staff was cut to only 40 people. Top management was
overhauled and reduced from 25 to only 10. Many of these were new appointees
from outside the company or further down the organisation. Operating
companies were given far greater freedom to make their own decisions.
At the same time, the cement equipment business was reorganised into seven
divisions, moving responsibility down the organisation, says Mr Riisager.
This freedom helped the group internationalise, particularly into south-east
Asia, which is now one of the few markets still growing. The cement
equipment operations were given a further boost in 1990 when it acquired
Fuller, one of its main competitors in the US.
The cement equipment business is the most important and now most profitable
part of the group, claims Mr Riisager, making about 45 per cent of group
profits.
The business has survived the recession in Europe and the US well, by
concentrating on south-east Asia and south and central America.
Meanwhile, some of the operations emanating from cement continue to perform
well. Miljo, for example, the environmental protection business, is enjoying
exceptional growth, says Mr Riisager. The company develops, designs and
markets complete flue gas cleaning systems for the power, incineration,
cement and paper and pulp industries. Mr Riisager says Miljo's sales were
only about DKr200m in 1989 and he expects them to reach DKr1bn this year.
FLS's freight forwarding business, Dan Transport, is also doing well,
although Mr Riisager admits its success is strange given the bad state of
the freight market. Sales increased from DKr1.2bn in 1990 to DKr1.6bn last
year.
Mr Riisager says the subsidiary is highly profitable.
Some FLS businesses are suffering from the recession, however. The depressed
state of the building market in Denmark has hit its building materials
business.
Similarly, the demand for FLS polyethylene packaging has been hit. The
company is the fourth-largest European manufacturer of polyethylene sacks.
Demand has collapsed in Europe by as much as 40 per cent.
Mr Riisager admits that many of the group's businesses are mature, with
little prospect of big growth. This was recognised in 1987, when the FLS had
recovered from a loss of DKr200m four years earlier, but was still only
generating profits of DKr73m.
This lack of growth explains why FLS decided to move into the aerospace
sector. From virtually nothing in 1988, the company has become the largest
independent third-party aircraft maintenance contractor.
'We had a small ground support equipment company in the UK, and Lovaux, a
British group, approached us to buy the business.
'We decided to buy Lovaux for DKr150m instead.' says Mr Riisager.
He says the industry was growing extremely rapidly, but was not structured
at all, consisting mainly of small and medium-sized businesses. Large
airlines needed to go to lots of different companies for their maintenance
needs.
In January 1991, the group acquired the engineering division of Dan Air, the
troubled UK airline, for Pounds 27.5m. Dan Air's business only had one
wide-body hanger, so FLS started planning a new one, says Mr Riisager.
However, FFV, another aircraft maintenance business, Swedish-owned but
mainly operating in the UK, also became available during the autumn of 1991.
FFV had hangers at Stansted and Manchester, each capable of handling two
Boeing 747s.
FLS's spending spree was launched just as the aviation industry was entering
its worst down-turn since the Second World War. Mr Riisager admits the
market remains difficult, with about 10 per cent of the world's aircraft
fleet parked in the Californian desert. However, he reckons the market will
move back to normal next year, although six months ago he thought it would
be this year.
The businesses have been reorganised into an engineering outfit based in
Stansted, an aerospace support operation at Gatwick supplying components to
airlines and FLS Aerospace Lovaux whose activities range from design and
production of light aircraft, to manufacture of ground support equipment and
military aircraft maintenance.
United Airlines and Continental of the US have both recently signed
contracts with the division. Dan Air has also extended its three-year
contract for a total of six years.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (12): Wide range of products - Profile of
Novo Nordisk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'NOVO NORDISK is a strange company. It just doesn't fit into any
categories,' says Mr Kurt Anker Nielsen, its chief financial officer. 'Its
products range from insulin to enzymes for household detergents. Basically
we're a fine chemicals company, linked together by microbiology which we
apply in different areas.'
The group's strength is based on insulin, the essential treatment for
diabetes. It generated about DKr5bn of the group's total turnover of
DKr9.8bn last year.
The number of patients diagnosed each year with type one diabetes - the type
automatically requiring insulin - is growing at only between 2 per cent and
3 per cent, says Mr Nielsen. However the overall market is growing at about
45 per cent in the western world, including Japan, because doctors are
increasingly prescribing some insulin for type two diabetes which has
traditionally been controlled through exercise and diet.
Further growth is being added by the increased use of medicine by newly
industrialised nations.
The division created the Novopen, an insulin injector that can be carried
around in the pocket like a pen. Since its launch four years ago, about 10
per cent of the world's insulin is sold in cartridges for such pens. Novo
Nordisk controls 80 per cent of the cartridge market and is planning further
developments in delivery systems such as a nasal device.
Diabetes care represents about 75 per cent of the healthcare division's
DKr6.3bn turnover. The company has focused its research in three additional
therapeutic areas. These are human growth hormones, hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) and central nervous system diseases.
Norditropin, the division's human growth hormone, has been highly
successful, increasing its sales last year by 74 per cent to DKr869m, says
Mr Nielsen. The company hopes to add further indications for the drug, such
as chronic renal failure, fertility and wound healing.
Novo Nordisk's hormone replacement therapies are also growing rapidly - last
year sales increased 52 per cent to about DKr400m. Mr Nielsen attributes the
growth to the additional marketing muscle generated by the merger of Novo
and Nordisk Gentofte which created Novo Nordisk in 1989.
Much of the company's attention is focused on its central nervous system
(CNS) products. It is looking at selected areas, primarily stroke,
schizophrenia and epilepsy.
Novo Nordisk realises its limitations as a medium-sized pharmaceuticals
company, says Mr Nielsen. It has signed co-development deals with SmithKline
Beecham, the Anglo-American group, Schering of Germany and Abbot of the US.
Mr Nielsen explains that with eight to 10 development projects with
partners, the group has far more chance of bringing remunerative drugs to
market.
The company has set up research and development facilities in the US and
Japan. Such developments appear far removed from the bioindustrial group,
which with its detergents and plant protection businesses generate sales of
DKr2.6bn - about a third of Novo Nordisk's turnover.
Novo Nordisk dominates the industrial enzymes market with about 55 per cent
of the world market. The sector has grown rapidly over the past four years
at a rate of about 18 per cent by volume, says Mr Nielsen. But intense
competition from Gist-Brocades of the Netherlands, Genencor of the US and
Solvay of Belgium has been undermining prices.
The leading sector is enzymes for detergents where prices had been falling
by about 3 per cent a year until 1991. They have now stabilised, says Mr
Nielsen. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk's new fat-busting enzyme - Lipolase - has
been growing fast, capturing about 20 per cent of the world market. The
success of Lipolase was an important factor in the 22 per cent growth in
volume achieved by the bioindustrial group last year. Sales increased last
year nearly 20 per cent.
Novo Nordisk has recently made the unfashionable step of entering the plant
protection business. Most companies are trying to leave the sector because
of the high risks and low returns involved.
Mr Nielsen is adamant, however, that the move is the right one. The company
aims to develop bio-pesticides - products based on bacteria which are toxic
to pests but harmless to everything else. He believes bio-pesticides are
capable of revitalising the agrochemicals market.
The company is also targetting high value crops such as fruit and vegetables
rather than cereal crops. Presently the business has sales of about Dollars
15m a year.
Novo Nordisk's stated aim is to achieve earnings growth of 15 per cent a
year. Mr Nielsen believes the group has the right portfolio of products to
achieve its target, although he admits the company can be driven off course
by external events.
One such event that has created problems is the recent turbulence in the
currency markets. More than 80 per cent of sales are not in Danish Kroner.
Last month the group warned that currency instability would have a
considerable negative impact on its third-quarter earnings.
Mr Nielsen is confident, however, that the company is sufficiently robust
that expectations for the full - year will remain unchanged.
A strange company, but not an unprofitable one.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (11): Fertile project exploits recycled
wastes - Industrial Symbiosis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few years ago, the local authorities were on the brink of stopping
industrial expansion at the small harbour town of Kalundborg on the west
coast of Sjaelland.
Environmental officers totted up the pollution from the four plants on which
the town relies and concluded that it was as much as the local environment
could stand.
This was bad news for the town, as well as for the plants - an oil refinery
operated by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, the 1.5MW Asnaes
coal-fired power plant, the fermentation plants used by Novo Nordisk in the
production of insulin and enzymes, and Gyproc, a Swedish-owned producer of
plasterboard for the building industry.
The plant managers, however, found an error in the West Sjaelland county's
arithmetic. Totalling the waste from each plant gave the wrong result
because a considerable proportion of the waste from each plant was re-used
by the other plants.
From this beginning, what might have turned into an acrimonious battle
between the county and the industrialists has turned into a fertile project
to exploit the potential for recycling wastes from each of the four plants -
a process which they call industrial symbiosis.
The more the plants consider the problem, the more ways they find for
re-using each other's waste products, which come in the form of water,
steam, gas, gypsum, and sulphur.
'Finding new projects has become a sport for us all,' said Mr Valdemar
Christensen, station superintendent of the Asnaes power facility.
For the companies, and for the town of Kalundborg, the bottom line is that
that the industrial operations are expanding fast and relations between the
local community and its industries has improved dramatically.
The Statoil refinery is in the middle of a DKr2.2bn investment to increase
capacity by 50 per cent to 4.8m tonnes of refinery products a year. Novo
Nordisk and Gyproc are also increasing production capacity substantially in
Kalundborg.
The project in which the plants are engaged is not being carried out as a
philanthropic contribution to local development. 'In the end it is strictly
commercial, and there are knife-edge price negotiations between us,' said
Statoil manager, Mr Mogens Granhoj.
Asnaes sells hot water to the town for district heating, steam to Statoil
and Novo Nordisk, warm water to its own fish farm, where sea trout and
turbot are produced, gypsum from de-sulphurisation of smokestack emissions
to Gyproc and sulphur to fertiliser producer Kemira for sulphuric acid
production.
Statoil sends cooling water and waste water to Asnaes, which uses some of it
for keeping down coal dust, recycling some of the water back to Statoil in
the form of steam.
Gas, usually flared off by oil refineries, is sent by Statoil to Asnaes and
Gyproc as part-replacement for oil and coal.
Novo Nordick produces large quantities of biomass in the fermentation
process used in production of enzymes and insulin. This is used as
fertiliser by local farms.
Industrial symbiosis in Kalundborg gives a saving in use of resources of
30,000 tonnes of coal, 19,000 tonnes of oil, 1.4m tonnes of water and 80,000
tonnes of gypsum, the plants calculate.
The reduction in pollution through waste products is 200,000 tonnes of
carbon dioxide and 1,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 135,000 tonnes of fly
ash, 80,000 tonnes of gypsum, 0.9m tonnes of water and 2,900 tonnes of
sulphur.
The potential for reducing pollution and saving resources is by no means
exhausted. The plants are developing new ideas all the time.
One of them, said Mr Christensen, is a heat conversion project to produce
cold water - 'district cooling' - but there is no large plant in the area
which requires very cold water. However, he thinks that the idea of district
cooling could have a big future in hot countries.
The use of biomass for power production is another idea under serious
consideration.
The managers have also developed a concept of reducing pollution through
waste products to zero through industrial symbiosis, but that, they admit,
is still a long way off.
The Kalundborg project would never have got off the ground if it were not
for close and trusting relationships between the plant managers, said Mr
Kurt Hvalso, Gyproc's manager.
He thinks that this has a lot to do with Scandinavian management style, with
a high degree of decentralisation to local managers. 'If we had all had to
ask group headquarters every time we wanted to go ahead, the project would
not have worked. In other countries, strong central control would strangle a
project like this,' he said.
It is essential, say the Kalundborg managers, that there is sufficient trust
between the plants for them to be able to talk about what they will be doing
in five year's time. Without this exchange of information, it would be
impossible to get the project to hang together.
The Kalundborg process has had several interesting spin-off effects on the
local community.
'We used to be on the defensive in the public debate,' said Mr Granhoj. 'Now
we are on the offensive. The county has even awarded us its environmental
prize.'
Success in co-operation between the industries has also spilled over into a
project, in co-operation with the local community, to upgrade the Kalundborg
region, more especially by improving educational facilities and making it
more relevant to the needs of local enterprises. The coming buzzwords in
Kalundborg are now 'regional symbiosis'.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (10): Fresh sense of urgency -
Unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WITH 320,000 people out of work
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
11 per cent of the workforce - it is not surprising that initiatives to
tackle unemployment will play a key role in the economic debate in Denmark
this autumn.
Indeed, there is a new sense of urgency about the problem because there is
no sign of the jobless total coming down through any cyclical upturn in the
economy.
Unemployment has been rising steadily over the past five years from 220,000
in 1987 and the hope was that this year would see the peak.
But that now looks unlikely, not least because of the recent turbulence in
international financial markets and its impact on leading trading partners
such as Sweden and the UK. Predictions that next year's jobless total will
fall to 285,000 now look too optimistic
Many certainly feel that the government should be doing more to get
unemployment down. The country now runs a substantial current account trade
surplus, so it is felt there is more room for manoeuvre than there has been
in the past.
There is also an argument that the country has paid a substantial price for
getting inflation down to the 2 per cent level, and that employment should
now be given increased priority.
In fact, the current thrust of government policy is not so much directed at
new job creation as at the reform of the unemployment benefit system and at
getting better value from the DKr40bn a year already spent on unemployment.
A special committee, the Zeuthen Committee, has recently looked at ways in
which the financing of the benefit system might be reformed.
At present, the state pays two thirds and employers and wage-earners the
other one third.
Without presenting it as a specific proposal, Zeuthen suggests that a new
system under which the state, employers and employees each paid one third of
the unemployment bill, might be better.
This is certainly something which Mr Knud Erik Kirkegaard, minister of
labour, would like to see.
'I want employers and employees to have more responsibility for the
unemployment system,' he says.
'Then when they are bargaining over wages and working time, they know that
the effect of their decisions could have a direct impact on unemployment and
their payments into the system.'
Neither the unions nor the employers totally reject reform of the current
system, although both have made their support conditional.
The unions say it must not leave their members worse off, so there have to
be cuts in income tax.
They also want reform to go hand in hand with a broader overhaul of active
labour market policy.
Employers, on the other hand, insist the measures do nothing to harm their
international competitiveness.
If reforming the finances of the system is one priority area, the other is
activating the unemployed, either by finding them temporary jobs or through
education and training schemes.
This is because it is felt the jobless would stand a better chance of
getting regular employment if they spent their time out of work actively
rather than passively, and because some fear the current system does not
provide enough incentive for people to find a job.
Youth unemployment, in particular, is an area for concern because 20 per
cent of the under-25s are either out of work or involved in training
programmes.
A recent report from the Social Commission, which looks specifically at the
question of youth unemployment, proposes cuts in some benefit levels, to
provide more incentive for young people to take up training or temporary
jobs.
At the same time, it says more trainee jobs and places within the
educational system need to be provided.
The government has already set up a number of pilot schemes to promote
practical training and employment in the private sector, hoping to win
broad-based political support for more permanent measures to be introduced
next year.
It is also planning specific investments in infrastructure which will be
outlined in its 1993 budget. But it is not clear how much impact these
measures will have on the overall unemployment total.
Mr Kirkegaard is reluctant to commit himself to specific job reduction
targets, saying that too many forecasts have proved inaccurate in the past.
But he does believe it will be possible to create an average of 25,000 new
jobs a year to bring unemployment down to about 130,000-150,000 by the year
2000.
Many of those jobs will come in the service sector, he believes, catering to
an increased number of pensioners, for example.
The broader hope, however, is that recent upward pressure on the jobless
total will subside naturally simply because the growth that took place in
the size of the labour force in the 1980s will not be repeated in the 1990s.
Indeed, the size of the labour force has already stabilised and it is
expected to decrease later in the decade.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (9): Spectacular growth - Profile of
Foodmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE the relentless decline of the Danish fishing industry in recent
years, gross exports of fish products are worth DKr14bn a year to the
country.
That is because its fish processing industry has managed to ensure that its
fortunes are not entirely dependent on those of the Danish fishing fleet.
Imports make up as much as 50 per cent of the raw fish processed.
Foodmark stands out within the sector not just by virtue of its size but
because of the speed at which it has grown in the past three years. In 1989
it had just 278 employees and a net turnover of DKr277m. Today turnover is
about DKr2.4bn, and it employs 2,400 people.
The spectacular growth has been achieved thanks to an acquisition strategy
formulated by Mr Lars Rahbek Hansen, managing director. He was recruited by
the old investment company, SN Invest, from which Foodmark has evolved.
Mr Hansen had previously been in charge of his family fishing concern,
Rahbekfisk, and it this company which Foodmark has used as the platform for
its expansion. In just 2 1/2 years a total of five companies have been
bought through a strategy which has not just begun the process of
rationalisation in the fragmented Danish fish processing sector but which
has also taken the group into Europe.
Rahbekfisk, an oven-ready dishes specialist, was the first acquisition,
although the takeover was only completed in November 1991 after a period of
stake-building dating back to May 1988. It remains the largest company in
the group, with about 800 employees in Denmark and 250 in England.
Two other Danish companies have also been acquired - Thorfisk Holding and
Hugo Mogelberg Fiskeindustri. Thorfisk employs about 700 people and
concentrates on exporting fresh and frozen fish. Hugo Mogelberg, with 250
employees, specialises in plaice exports.
The most recent acquisitions, both carried out this year, have taken
Foodmark into Norway and further into the UK. The Norwegian company Nordkyn,
which has a filleting factory in Meeham, was bought at the beginning of the
year.
However, much the bigger purchase came in September when the group bought
the Scottish company Macfish for Pounds 9.2m from Geest and Associated
Fisheries. Fraserburgh-based Macfish concentrates on smoked fish and breaded
products, mainly for the retail market.
Foodmark's expansion strategy has been shaped by two main factors - to
secure sources of supply and to get as close to the customer as possible.
As these customers comprise many of the leading supermarket chains
throughout Europe, the group feels it has to guarantee them not just quality
but continuity of supply and rapid delivery.
The group has already become the leading fish processing group in Denmark
and, with its Danish companies exporting 94 per cent of their production, it
is also the leading Danish exporter of fish products.
Now the group has set itself a much more ambitious goal which is to become
one of the leading producers of fish products in Europe. Further
acquisitions are planned and are more likely to be in Europe than in the
home market.
'We don't get more fish through Danish ports by buying more Danish
companies,' says Mr Hansen.
Nevertheless, Mr Hansen believes overcapacity means further rationalisation
within the Danish fish processing industry - characterised by small,
family-owned companies - is inevitable.
'The restructuring will take care of itself because the fishing industry is
facing a very difficult time. It is a game of survival of the fittest,' he
says
So far the strategy has certainly been successful, if judged in profit
terms. The group's net result has expanded from DKr28.8m in 1989 to DKr32.2m
in 1990 to DKr45.0m last year. A further positive development is expected
this year.
It is not surprising therefore that the group's main shareholders seem happy
to back its expansion plans, obviating the need for a stock market listing,
at least in the near future.
Yet uncertainties remain, not least the impact of currency movements on a
group that is so export dependent.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (8): World's leading producer - Profile of
Rockwool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION to spend Dollars 5,000 back in 1935 buying some 'primitive'
drawings from a US company is the point from which Denmark's Rockwool group
has developed its leading position in the world of insulation.
It must have seemed something of a gamble at the time, but the decision's
visionary quality is apparent from the fact that the group is now the
world's leading producer of rock wool and one of the four biggest producers
of mineral wool.
Rockwool is based in Hedehusene, outside Copenhagen. It has 5,800 employees
and last year turnover amounted to DKr5.20bn.
The group is not only one of Denmark's biggest privately-owned companies, it
is also one of the country's most international groups. Eleven of the
group's 14 factories are located outside Denmark - four in Germany, three in
Norway, and one each in Canada, France, Holland and the UK.
About 80 per cent of the group's production takes place abroad and 90 per
cent of customers are outside Denmark.
The conscious strategy to expand abroad early on is one of the key elements
in the group's success, according to Mr Tom Kahler, managing director and
chief executive officer.
Rock wool production only began at the group's Danish plant in 1937 but
within three years the company also had factories operating in Norway and
Sweden. It set up its first factory in Germany in 1951.
Another aspect to the group's success, according to Mr Kahler, is a constant
emphasis on research and development. This has helped it to keep
technologically on a par with its main rivals who produce glass wool.
'Fifteen other companies in our field started up between the wars, but it
was our emphasis on research and development that enabled us to survive,'
says Mr Kahler.
The group's most important market is Germany which now accounts for about 30
per cent of turnover, compared with just 10 per cent in 1980. The German
subsidiary, Deutsche Rockwool, has 1,100 employees.
The group was swift to take advantage of the reunification process and had a
sales force working on the ground in eastern Germany as early as July 1990.
But the big move came in February 1991 when it acquired the largest mineral
wool factory in the former GDR, located in Flechtingen near Magdeburg, from
the Treuhand. Rockwool claims this made it the first Danish company to enter
the East German market and acquire production facilities.
Rockwool is certainly not alone among Danish building companies in seeing
the attractions of the German market. At a time when the domestic
construction market has been so depressed, as many as 500 Danish building
groups have been active in both eastern and western Germany. Last year it is
reckoned that Danish building exports to Germany were worth DKr10bn, out of
total Danish exports to Germany worth DKr51bn.
It was thanks largely to Deutsche Rockwool's contribution, where sales rose
30 per cent last year, that Rockwool was able to raise 1991 turnover by 11
per cent.
Severe competition and stagnating construction activity in many of its other
markets held back the performance, and the pre-tax profit only rose slightly
to DKr294m from DKr283m.
This year conditions have proved just as difficult. But the group has
learned to survive the hard times.
In the early 1980s, for example, the combination of falling oil prices and
depressed housebuilding activity took a big toll on profits.
The group makes great play of the fact that energy consumption and air
pollution are greatly reduced by the use of its insulation products.
'One of our companies has estimated that each kilo of CO emitted during
production spares the environment a total of 550kg of CO, because our
products reduce heating needs when installed in buildings or technical
plants,' says a recent annual report.
However, Rockwool is anxious not to be seen entirely as an insulating group.
Its also supplies netting to the fishing industry, for example, and growing
media to horticulturists.
This highlights the group's continual drive to develop new products. 'Our
expansion will not come from taking market share from other insulating
manufacturers but from going in for more sophisticated products,' says Mr
Kahler.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (7): Enormously successful mixture -
Profile of Legoland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE decided to obtain some proper consumer response before writing about the
Legoland family park, the miniature township built from millions of Lego toy
building bricks. So we took along Michela, aged 5 1/2 , from France.
It was a magical experience for her. She was intrigued and delighted by the
model villages, with ferries and cars plying a busy trade, and so convinced
by the life-size models in Pirateland (everywhere else the models are in a
scale of 1:20) that she was more than half-convinced that they were real
pirates, waving encouragingly to the automated marooned pirate who calls for
help from passing visitors in a doleful electronic voice.
Michela loved every minute of the four-hour visit and even that was not long
enough to sample all that Legoland has to offer. But by that time the adults
were happy with the day's success, if ready to drop. We had to give the
museum of dolls and dolls' houses and old mechanical toys a miss.
There was obvious satisfaction among the many other children in the park,
which delights children up to the age of about 13 - and also a lot of
parents.
There is something very Danish about Legoland, an enormously successful
mixture of amusement park - not at all brassy and not too large (the site is
about 10 hectares) - and town-in-miniature, as neat and as bright as
Denmark's well-kept farms and immaculate fields.
In fact, it is not just one township: the park is dotted with models of many
towns and villages, including Dutch, Danish and Norwegian, as well as models
of famous buildings, such as Brussels' ornate 15th century Town Hall,
correct in every detail and all in Lego bricks.
The word Lego comes from two Danish words 'lej godt', meaning 'play well';
and in the Legoland park there are plenty of opportunities to play, both
with the Lego bricks and construction kits and on the fair-ground
amusements.
It is a most unlikely place for a leading tourist attraction - in the middle
of the Jutland heathland, at Billund, far from any large population centres.
This, however, is where the Lego Group has the headquarters of what has
become one of the world's biggest and most successful ventures in the
manufacture of toys.
The group, a private company controlled by the Kirk Christiansen family,
which founded the company in the 1930s, has about 7,500 employees, of which
4,100 are in Denmark.
Published turnover in 1991 was DKr4.47bn, on which was made a net profit of
DKr341m. However, the published turnover applies only to companies employing
5,000 people, so total turnover is significantly larger.
Its manufacturing base is in Billund, but it also has manufacturing
operations in Connecticut (US), Switzerland, Germany, Brazil and South
Korea. Altogether the group has 36 companies in 21 countries.
It outgrew Denmark long ago. Ninety-eight per cent of its sales are outside
Denmark and its biggest markets now are Germany, the US, Britain, France and
Italy.
Lego has a lot of imitators and devotes considerable resources to trying to
prevent them from infringing Lego patents. But the Lego product has got what
it takes: the group noted in its 1991 annual report that, although there
have never been more imitators, their share of the market had fallen for the
fourth successive year.
In spite of its remote location, Legoland attracts about 1.1m visitors
during a season, which lasts for five months from May 1 to the third Sunday
in September.
It is Denmark's biggest tourist attraction outside Copenhagen. In 1991,
467,000 visitors came from Denmark, equivalent to one in 11 of the
population. From elsewhere in Europe, the number of visitors was: from
Germany (300,000), Sweden (140,000), Norway (66,000), the Netherlands
(51,000) and Britain (45,000).
Legoland has been a success in Denmark ever since it opened in 1968, but can
it be repeated elsewhere? Lego hopes so, and it has many enthusiastic
acolytes abroad.
When the company announced in 1991 that it was planning to set up Legoland
family parks in other countries, it received almost 1,000 inquiries, many
from mayors and governors anxious to acquire an important tourist attraction
for their own town.
It has now chosen six geographical locations for closer consideration, three
in the US and three in Europe.
The European locations are in the densely-populated border area between
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and in the London area.
In the US, California, the area around Washington DC and New England have
been singled out.
Each park will require an investment of about Dollars 100m, and aims to
attract about 1.4m visitors a year initially. Lego hopes to decide where the
first will be later this year or in 1993.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (6): Worldwide help for water authorities
 -Flood Control Research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'AEROSPACE technology is spectacular, but water is important,' says
Professor Michael Abbott, who has been closely associated with the Danish
Hydraulic Institute (DHT) for almost 30 years.
During this time he has helped it become one of the foremost hydraulics
research institutes in the world. DHT is an autonomous self-supporting
research body, associated with the Danish Academy of Technical Sciences.
Since its foundation in 1964 it has been headed by Mr Torben Sorensen. It is
today carrying out the world's three biggest aquatic environment research
programmes:
the mathematical model of the Venice Lagoon (Mr Sorensen leads an
international committee designing a system to protect Venice from the sea);
the Danish Great Belt Bridge environmental monitoring system; and
work for the Bangladesh river system and flood control management project.
Danish pre-eminence in water science owes much to Professor Abbott,
British-born professor at the International Institute for Hydraulic and
Environmental Engineering at Delft, the Netherlands, and adviser to the
Danish institute.
He has been responsible for developing the computer modelling systems and
programmes used by the institute and by water authorities throughout the
world.
Until recently, hydraulic modelling was carried out with the aid of
hand-built miniature models such as a planned port area, which would be
subjected to wave pressure and storms in the laboratory.
Physical models have now been largely replaced by mathematical models,
reducing a typical cost from DKr5m for a physical model to DKr500,000 for a
computer model. For large and complex environments, such as the Bangladesh
river system, there is no alternative to mathematical models.
In his work, Professor Abbott has turned what began as 'computational
hydraulics' into a new science of hydroinformatics, the word he used as the
title of a book which he published last year.
He uses it as broad term covering the method by which various disciplines
within water resource engineering can use computer data more efficiently.
'We build systems in which a large variety of people, without knowing each
other, input knowledge, and enable a large number of people, also unknown to
each other, to access that knowledge and make use of it,' he explained.
For example, a computer model of an urban sewage management system enables
staff to know exactly what is happening anywhere in the system and the
effect of opening or closing a particular sluice or weir.
The DHI has a total staff of 160, of whom half have PhDs or MSc degrees. It
has 18 subsidiaries or agencies around the world, a turnover of about
DKr100m, and it has always made a small profit, said Mr Sorensen.
The work of the Danish institutes is attracting a lot of attention from big
companies, which after the end of the cold war are redeploying scientists
into new fields, including environmental control.
By far the biggest of the DHI's projects is the water control system for
Bangladesh, part of a programme initiated after the devastating floods in
1986. Altogether 26 projects are being carried out with the World Bank as
main co-ordinator and many countries contributing aid and expertise.
The DHI initially provided a system to establish computer-based models which
can simulate the pattern of floods arising from the three great rivers, the
Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna, which flow through Bangladesh.
The first programme was supplemented by setting up a permanent Surface Water
Modelling Centre in Bangladesh, which collects extensive data on such items
as rainfall and water levels. The information gathered is used for flood
management, flood forecasting and to provide the basis for the lay-out and
design for engineering works.

DENMARK did not get much of a mention during the recent turbulence in
European foreign exchange markets - which, as Mrs Bodil Nyboe Andersen,
deputy governor of the National Bank (central bank) put it, was 'a good
sign'.
Mr Henning Dyremose, finance minister, and Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, economy
minister, never tire of asserting that the country has one of the strongest
economies in Europe, and they would like to keep it that way.
By strong, they mean that there is a large current balance of payments
surplus, low inflation and a moderate budget deficit.
The balance of payments surplus was DKr23bn, or 2.6 per cent of gross
domestic product, in the 12 months to June. Consumer prices rose by 2.1 per
cent over the 12 months to August.
The budget deficit in 1992 will be about DKr38bn, or 4.4 per cent of GDP,
while the total public sector borrowing requirement, according to government
estimates, will be about DKr17bn, or 1.9 per cent of GDP, this year and
slightly lower in 1993.
The surplus on trade in goods and services over the 12 months to June was
about DKr56bn, or 6.5 per cent of GDP. Denmark is one of the few countries
to meet the so-called convergence criteria required of countries
participating in the third and final stage of the EC's economic and monetary
union.
Ironically, however, it is likely to make exemption from a commitment to
join Emu one of the conditions for solving the problems caused by its
rejection of the Maastricht treaty in the June referendum.
The external strength of the economy may be weakened by the depreciation of
sterling and the lire, by the savage fiscal policy imposed by Sweden this
autumn, and by the slowdown in the German economy.
Britain is especially important for exports of Danish agricultural products,
notably bacon and other pigmeat products.
Germany and Sweden are the country's two largest export markets.
In its August economic survey, prior to the foreign exchange turbulence, the
Economy Ministry predicted a volume increase in exports of 4.3 per cent in
both 1992 and 1993.
A somewhat lower growth rate in 1993 now seems probable. The economic
strengths are paralleled by some economic weaknesses, especially low growth
rates and high unemployment.
The annual average increase in GDP for 1987-91 was 1.1 per cent.
A bad harvest and rising interest rates forced the Economy Ministry to
reduce its growth forecast for 1992 from about 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent,
but it is hoping for a better 1993, with a forecast (in August) GDP growth
rate of 2.5 per cent.
Unemployment is expected to average 10.7 per cent, or 305,000, this year. It
has risen slowly but steadily from 9.3 per cent in 1989.
The combination of external strength with low growth and high unemployment
has raised political demands 'to spend the current account surplus' - that
is, to relax fiscal policy in order to strengthen domestic demand and bring
down unemployment.
This issue will be an important one when the minority government sets out to
navigate the 1993 budget through the Folketing this autumn (the final vote
on the Finance Act takes place in mid-December).
The government's economics ministers see the budget deficit as a threat to
the long-term stability of the economy, a point of view which has not been
weakened by the currency turbulence in neighbouring countries, where large
budget deficits have constituted part of the problem.
Mr Dyremose's 1993 draft budget strives to hold down expenditure, and
includes cuts of DKr7.5bn just to prevent automatic increases in
expenditure.
The proposed cuts include DKr3.5bn off transfer expenditure (from the
government to households) and a 4,000 reduction in civil service employment.
Compared with the 1992 Finance Act estimates, central government revenue
will rise in 1993 by 3.0 per cent to DKr306.5bn and expenditure by 4.3 per
cent to DKr340.4bn.
The budget deficit will be rise from an estimated DKr28bn when the Finance
Act was passed to DKr34bn next year but the actual deficit for 1992 is now
expected to be DKr38bn, so, if the budget sums conform with reality, the
deficit will fall in 1993.
It was already clear, before the Folketing assembled for the new
parliamentary year on October 6, that there was majority support for a
significantly looser budget than the government has proposed.
The cuts in transfer expenditure and reduction in civil service employment
do not appear to have sufficient support to be carried through.
The opposition Social Democratic party (SDP) has presented a policy
programme which, it claims, would create 170,000 jobs by the end of the
decade.
While the government predicts that, if current policies are maintained, the
net foreign debt - DKr264bn at the end of 1991 - will be eliminated by the
end of the decade, the SDP claims that its policies will leave the deficit
at about DKr80bn
Most of the jobs which the SDP will create will be in the public sector.
It wants to increase the number of places for adult education and training
by 60,000, to provide more jobs through labour market policies, to increase
personnel in child-care services and care of the elderly, and to widen the
opportunities for early retirement.
It also wants a big increase in infra-structure investments, a point on
which its wishes are not so far from the government's.
It is quite possible that the budget negotiations will break down, resulting
in an election. But assuming that the negotiations are successful and a
compromise is found, it is certain that the budget will be looser than
originally proposed.
This is not a prospect which appeals to the National Bank, as Mr Erik
Hoffmeyer, the governor, has made plain.
Denmark ran up a large foreign debt as a result of 26 consecutive years with
deficits on the current balance of payments account, between 1963 and 1989.
And it entered the 1980s with an enormous budget deficit, peaking at about
11 per cent of GDP in 1982-83.
Bringing the two deficits under control has been a painful process.
It is easier to loosen fiscal policy than it is to tighten it again, and
experience in the past with temporary easing of fiscal policy has always
been bad, said Mr Hoffmeyer earlier in the autumn, when proposals for
spending the current account surplus first surfaced.
'Now that we have achieved a stable economy for the first time in decades,
let's not gamble it away again,' he said.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (5): Relatively unscathed by recession -
The Banking Sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Danish banking and financial sectors have come through a five-year
recession relatively unscathed - relative, that is, to developments in the
other Nordic countries, where the governments have had to move in to support
the banks.
Indeed, Danish bankers are unhappy when they hear the words 'Nordic banking'
these days because it lumps Denmark together with countries where the
financial and banking crisis has had far more serious consequences.
The Danes have suffered one big disaster, the collapse of the Hafnia
insurance group's holding company. Hafnia Holding suspended payments to
creditors in August, when the falling value of strategic shareholdings in
its domestic rival, Baltica, and Swedish insurer Skandia wiped out its
equity capital. Hafnia's insurance companies are now up for sale.
The big bond-issuing mortgage credit institutes, which dominate mortgage
financing in Denmark, are under pressure. Their structure is such that they
do not run a risk of collapse, with loss to creditors, but they can reach a
situation in which they can no longer make new loans.
Kreditforening Danmark, one of the two big institutes (the other is
Nykredit), has come so close to this point that its chief executive, Mr Ole
Andresen, has called on the government to consider easing the
capital-adequacy ratio requirements as they apply to the mortgage credit
business.
The banks are not having an easy time either. Taken together with savings
banks, they suffered a net loss of DKr2.9bn in 1990, and DKr400m in 1991.
Loss provisions soared from DKr6.57bn in 1989 to DKr10.40bn in 1990; and to
DKr11.86 in 1991, when they were an unhealthy 4.5 per cent of loans and
guarantees in the commercial banks and 4.8 per cent in the savings banks.
Loss provisions will be large again this year, perhaps just as large as in
1991. Nevertheless, the leading banks have not so far had serious problems
in maintaining their capital adequacy ratios, and are able to raise
subordinated loan capital without difficulty.
The basic reason why the banks have been able to absorb considerable losses,
said Mr Knud Sorensen, chairman of the Danish Banker's Association and chief
executive of Den Danske Bank, the country's largest bank, is that they were
very strongly capitalised when the recession took hold.
When the new Bank of International Settlements (BIS) rules for capital
adequacy were applied to the Danish banks, their average capital ratio was
found to be almost 14 per cent. The banks were not faced with the problem of
having to strengthen their capital ratios in the middle of a recession.
The government and the National Bank (central bank) fixed the minimum
capital ratio at 10 per cent for 1990 and 1991, coming down to 9 per cent
from January 1, 1993, and to 8 per cent in 1995. But the reduction in the
ratio of equity capital to risk-weighted assets will be counter-balanced by
a reduction in the share of subordinated loan capital which can be counted
in the capital base.
The banks find that the rules are becoming a problem. 'We are interested in
maintaining high capital ratios, but at the same time we do not want to
suffer competitively through having to maintain higher ratios than others,'
said Mr Sorensen.
Mr Thorleif Krarup, who in August was appointed chief executive of
Unidanmark - the parent company for Unibank, the second largest bank - was
more forthright. The rule that Danish banks, from next January, can only
count 20 per cent of subordinated loan capital in the capital adequacy base
is tougher than required by the BIS rules (in the UK, for example, banks
will be able to count 50 per cent of subordinated loan capital in the
capital-adequacy base). 'I would like to see a discussion about this,' said
Mr Krarup.
'It is very natural that the government and the National Bank should want to
maintain absolute confidence in the system, but we need to ask whether the
BIS rules are not enough in themselves.
'We have to be careful that credit policy does not become so restrictive
that all new developments are brought to a halt,' he said.
Mr Krarup emphasised that Unidanmark did not have a solvency problem. 'There
is no doubt that we can meet our capital adequacy requirements. We have an
earnings problem, but not a solvency problem.'
Unibank reported a DKr1.5bn first half loss this year, following losses of
DKr1.1bn in 1990 and DKr1.7bn in 1991. A slightly higher loss than last year
is forecast for 1992, depending partly on how prices move in the bond and
share markets.
While Denmark's largest banks, which in addition to Danske and Unibank
include Bikuben and Jyske Bank, remain strongly capitalised, a run of
difficult years is putting pressure on some of the medium-sized regional
banks.
Analysts will not be surprised if some of these banks run into
capital-adequacy problems. In the past, it has been the rule that when
smaller banks run into trouble, larger banks absorb them, often paying a
considerable goodwill payment to the troubled bank's shareholders for the
privilege.
'If a middle-sized bank went down now,' said Mr Sorensen, 'it would not be
so easy for the bigger banks to go in and save it. They are too preoccupied
with their own problems.'
A situation would arise in which the finance industry supervisors and the
National Bank had to mount a rescue action. Depositors' funds, however, are
guaranteed by the authorities.
The banks generally have worked hard to reduce their costs, chiefly by
reducing staff; but what they need now is lower interest rates and a more
lively economy.
'We are living in a vacuum. Nothing is happening. People can hardly even be
bothered to paint their kitchens,' said Mr Sorensen.
During the high-inflation years, the assets used as collateral for loans to
businesses and households rose steadily in value, and so did nominal
incomes, while the value of debt was steadily reduced. In a low-inflation
society, the value of assets used as collateral will not rise and neither
will nominal incomes - which means that if a household or a business is
faced with a financial shock, it will be much more vulnerable.
For the banks, said Mr Krarup, this might mean that loss provisions would
rise by a factor of three compared with former times, so that instead of
averaging 0.5-0.75 per cent of loans and guarantees, as they did until the
late 1980s, the average would be closer to 2 per cent.
This would require adjustments to interest-rate margins (between rates on
deposits and advances), which are still based on the expectation that loss
provisions will come down to the old levels, and more sensible pricing,
reflecting the new conditions, he added.
Meanwhile, there is a political problem troubling the banks. The government
is considering how to lower the income tax rate, which would automatically
reduce the tax value of mortgage relief.
This would cause a new fall in property prices, leading to a decline in the
collateral for loans, said Mr Peter Erling Nielsen, specialist in monetary
policy at Copenhagen University. 'The system would not be able to stand
this,' he said. 'We must not rock the boat just now. I am not sure that the
politicians have understood this.'

Life begins in an institution for the average Dane, because both parents are
out to work.
This is one of the most marked changes in the way the Danes live over the
past 20 years, according to the 1992 edition of Living Conditions in
Denmark, a statistical picture of the way they live now by the Central
Bureau of Statistics and National Social Research Institute.
The housewife has almost disappeared, comprising only 4 per cent of the
female population by occupation today compared with 43 per cent in 1974.
The labour force participation rate for women aged 16-66 is 76 per cent as
against 37 per cent in 1950. In the age group 25-44 among married women, 91
per cent work, only slightly fewer than the 95 per cent of men in that age
group who work.
Among families with small children (aged six or less), both parents work
full time in 42 per cent of the families, and in another 36 per cent one
parent will have a part-time job while the other works full time. Only one
in five children is cared for full-time by a parent.
Some 48 per cent of all children aged two or less spend the day in a
day-care institution, a figure which rises to 67 per cent for the
three-to-six age-group (the normal school starting age is seven). In 1973,
only 10 per cent of the youngest age-group were looked after in day-care
institutions and only 32 per cent of the three-to-six age-group.
Children can count themselves quite lucky to get into this world. In 1990
there was one legal abortion for every three live births: 20,600 abortions
for 63,500 births.
Most parents of small children are married, but about 27 per cent of
children up to the age of two years live with parents who cohabit without a
marriage certificate and 12 per cent live with only one parent. About one
fifth of all cohabiting couples live together without a marriage
certificate.
Divorce is frequent, and the incidence is rising. About 28 per cent of
marriages made in 1970 ended in divorce 15 years later, doubling the rate
compared with those married in 1950. The rate will be even higher for those
married in 1980, among whom the divorce rate was 14 per cent after five
years.
The fact that men do more of the chores about the house is evidently not
helping much. Half the men say they do 25-50 per cent of the household
chores; in 1976 only a quarter of the men claimed to do as much around the
house.
Most families (85 per cent) with children live in single-family houses,
although only about 54 per cent of all households live in owner-occupied
dwellings. They have plenty of space: more than 60 per cent live in
dwellings with more than one room per person and only 10 per cent in
dwellings with more than one occupant per room.
Much has happened in education over the past 30 years. In 1991, 28 per cent
of the 20-29 age group had passed the basic university matriculation exam
('student exam' - equivalent to A-levels in England) compared with only 5
per cent in 1962. Some 44 per cent obtained the exam-based school-leaving
certificate at 16 compared with only 17 per cent in 1962.
About 15 per cent of this age-group receive no further training after
leaving school, down from 31 per cent in 1980. Some 63 per cent of the men
and 52 per cent of the women obtain post-school education or vocational
training.
Among men, 58 per cent work 37-38 hours a week (the standard working week),
while 26 per cent work more. About 45 per cent of women work the standard
week and 10 per cent work more. Sickness absenteeism is low; 3.9 per cent
among hourly paid men and 5.7 per cent among hourly paid women, falling to
1.6 per cent for men and 2.8 per cent for women in salaried positions.
Use of data processing equipment at work is frequent but not yet ubiquitous.
Among employees in senior or intermediate positions, half spend half their
time using data equipment while just over a third never use it. A third of
lower level salaried personnel and about 14 per cent of hourly paid skilled
workers use data equipment.
Some 76 per cent or more of those who are skilled workers or have salaried
jobs say that work enables them to learn something new and to become more
qualified, while about 47 per cent of unskilled workers had this view.
Income distribution, as measured by calculated life-time earnings, seems to
be relatively even, although the distribution of wealth remains heavily
unbalanced. The richest one tenth of the population owned 63 per cent of
assessed net assets in 1986 compared with 84 per cent in 1939. The poorest
tenth owned 1 per cent of the wealth.
Total lifetime income by occupation has become more even over the past 20
years. A law or economics graduate in 1970 could look forward to lifetime
earnings which were double the earnings of a skilled worker, but today he or
she can only expect to earn 130 per cent more. A teacher in the ordinary
schools (children aged seven to 16) will earn about 110 per cent of a
skilled worker's lifetime income.
Some people remain poor, however. About 4 per cent of the population had an
income of less than DKr1,000 a week in 1986 and another 5 per cent had an
income of less than DKr1,500 a week.
About 91 per cent of households have a colour television, 95 per cent a
telephone, 88 per cent a refrigerator-freezer, 67 per cent a washing
machine, 27 per cent a dishwasher, 58 per cent a car and 14 per cent a
personal computer.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (2): Gap between leaders and led -
Domestic Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, elected leader of the Social Democratic Party last
April after a leadership contest, has succeeded in irritating his political
adversaries by calling for a public debate on the subject of political and
business ethics.
The 48-year-old party leader's point in playing the the ethical card is that
he thinks there is a crisis of confidence in relationships between the
politicians and the voters and that an emphasis on morality is necessary to
restore a relationship of trust and understanding between the two.
As leader of the Social Democratic Party he has a particular problem,
because voting in the referendum on the Maastricht treaty in June
demonstrated a particularly wide gap between the party leadership, which
campaigned for a Yes, and the party's supporters, of whom at least 60 per
cent voted No.
He has somehow to establish a new sense of understanding between the party
and its supporters.
The electorate's rejection of the Maastricht treaty, after the Folketing had
approved it by 130 votes to 25, is only one aspect of a gap between leaders
and led, however, and it goes beyond politics.
The colossal losses sustained by the financial sector and the summary
dismissal of some of the best-known names in the local financial world - Mr
Per Villum, Hansen Hafnia's chief executive officer, in April, and Mr Steen
Rasborg, Unibank's chief, in August, to name only two - has started a debate
on the ethics of the business world.
Many people, Mr Rasmussen among them, are offended by the fact that managers
who have lost large sums of shareholders' money have received substantial
(by Danish standards) 'golden handshakes.'
Mr Rasmussen has given a party-political edge to the ethical debate,
painting the Conservative-Liberal coalition government as being, morally
speaking, slightly frayed around the edges after 10 consecutive years in
office.
The charge relates more especially to an affair known as the Tamil scandal,
a running sore on the body politic which may lead to the collapse of the
government this winter.
The Tamil scandal began in 1987 when the then minister of justice, who has
since resigned, ordered postponement of permission for the relatives in Sri
Lanka of Tamil refugees in Denmark to join their families in Denmark.
This infringed the legal right, under Danish law, of the Tamil refugees to
bring their close relatives to Denmark. Ministry of Justice civil servants
connived at the minister's act of maladministration, which has caused a
collapse of political confidence in the ministry.
In the spring of 1989, Mr Poul Schluter, the Conservative Party leader who
celebrated his 10th anniversary as his country's leader on September 10,
made a report to the Folketing on the Tamil issue in which he assured the
Folketing that 'nothing has been swept under the carpet.'
For more than a year a judicial inquiry led by a High Court judge has taken
evidence to establish whether there is a case for impeaching any of the
implicated ministers. It is expected that the report will be published late
this autumn, but no date has been set yet.
The issue in Mr Schluter's case is what he knew and when he knew it, and did
he, in order to protect the reputation of his minister of justice, mislead
the Folketing in his 'carpet' speech.
If the report criticises the prime minister, who, say colleagues, is
absolutely convinced that he acted in good faith all along, there is little
doubt that the small centre parties - the Radical Liberals, Centre Democrats
and the Christian People's Party - will pull the carpet out from under him.
'In other times, criticism might not have been taken so seriously, but the
ethical climate caused by the crisis of confidence between people and
politicians will affect the outcome of the Tamil case,' predicted Mr Herbert
Pundik, editor-in-chief of the respected Copenhagen daily newspaper
Politiken.
If the Tamil scandal does not help Mr Rasmussen into office - and Mr
Schluter has made it clear that he will not go without calling an election -
Mr Rasmussen's way to power may not be easy.
In his 10 years in office, Mr Schluter has always headed minority
governments and often - on more than 100 occasions - had to accept defeats
in the Folketing.
But he has remained in office because there has not so far been a majority
in favour of a Social Democratic government.
Mr Schluter's governments have put the economy back on an even keel, which
is in itself a considerable achievement, but when it comes to such
Conservative and Liberal dreams as lowering taxes, actually reducing public
expenditure (as opposed to slowing the rise) and weaning the individual from
reliance on the welfare state, little has been achieved.
This, however, seems to be the way in which the agenda for the 1990s is
shaping up, and it is an agenda which Mr Rasmussen's Social Democrats may
have to accept if they want to return to power.
It is significant that the Radical Liberal Party, which holds the swing vote
between left and right in the Folketing, shares this general attitude.
'Danes with a problem automatically assume that the commune (local council)
will solve it. They can't stand on their own legs any more. This has got to
change,' said Mrs Marianne Jelved, Radical leader.
Some of Mrs Jelved's requirements for the 1990s include making the labour
market, instead of the state, finance the unemployment benefit system;
halting cash welfare benefits to under-25s; an end to subsidies to almost
everyone through the housing system; and reductions in income taxes.
'We have got to loosen up the over-gearing of the welfare state. If the
Social Democrats won't do so, they can forget about being the next
government,' said Mrs Jelved.
The Social Democrats cannot form a government without Radical support - and
unfortunately for Mr Rasmussen, the other party whose support he needs, the
left-wing Socialist People's Party, is not sympathetic to Mrs Jelved's brand
of liberal reform.
In government, Mr Rasmussen would go for 'a controlled loosening' of fiscal
policy in order to increase domestic demand and create more jobs, but he
aims to maintain the present government's low-inflation policy and will
stick to the fixed exchange through membership of the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System, he says.
Lower taxes are not on his agenda, which seems very much like a traditional
Social Democratic programme with heavy reliance on large public spending
programmes.
Among highlights of his party's programme are substantial new spending on
infrastructure investment in roads, railways and ports; subsidies for urban
renewal programmes; and ambitious programmes to provide job opportunities
through job rotation and activating the unemployed by providing places in
training and educational courses.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (1): Suspended animation - Denmark's
future relationship with Europe will be determined over the next few months.
Meanwhile, the country is living in suspended animation as a result of
uncertainty caused by the Maastricht dilemma and the recent currency
turbulence in Europe

THE self-confidence, indeed self-satisfaction, of the Danes can rarely have
soared to such heights as it did in June this year when they opened the
month by rejecting the Maastricht treaty in a referendum on June 2 and then
went on to win the European soccer championships.
Ever since those heady days the Danes have enjoyed the feeling that David
must have had after slaying Goliath.
Nothing, perhaps, better illustrates the extraordinary upsurge in national
feeling than the fact that more people turned out in Copenhagen to welcome
home the soccer team than took to the streets on Liberation Day in 1945 to
celebrate the end of the German occupation.
But the country's leaders have not shared so fully in the popular euphoria.
They have a deeply worried look.
The optimistic view of the consequences of the Danish No to Maastricht is
that Denmark has become a catalyst for change in public and political
opinion and that modifications to Europe's structure will follow which will
make the Community more acceptable to public opinion.
The pessimistic view is that the Danes have placed themselves firmly on the
sidelines of Europe and that what was seen by the voters as an assertion of
national independence will instead render Denmark dependent on the
Community, but without influence on its deliberations or decisions.
The drama of Denmark's future relationship with Europe will be played out
over the next few months and what the Danes themselves think or do may be of
relatively little significance compared with what the Germans, the French,
the British and others decide.
In the interim, the country is living in suspended animation. All systems
have gone into dead-slow as a result of the uncertainty caused by the
Maastricht dilemma and the currency turbulence in Europe over the past few
weeks.
Economic activity has sunk to such a low level, says Mr Knud Sorensen, chief
executive of the country's largest bank, 'that people can't even be bothered
to paint their own kitchens any longer.'
Still, Denmark's real GDP is expected by the government to increase by about
1.3 per cent this year and, but for the worst harvest for generations,
caused by a long early-summer drought, the growth rate would have been half
a point higher, which would have put the country among Europe's better
performers.
Denmark itself was not at the eye of the currency storm. Speculation against
the krone pushed short-time term market rates of interest to exotic levels
(at the time of writing, the one-month CIBOR was 29 per cent), but the
Nationalbank (central bank) did not have to raise its own key interest rates
to control the crisis. Given the state of the Danish economy just a few
years ago, the ability of the country to weather the currency storm
relatively unscathed is remarkable.
Over the past 10 years, under the guidance of a succession of minority
governments all headed by Mr Poul Schluter, the Conservative Party leader
who celebrated his 10th anniversary as his country's leader on September 10,
the external strength of the economy has been transformed.
In 1982, Denmark was suffering from both an uncomfortably large external
deficit and a budget deficit which peaked at about 11 per cent of GDP. In
the course of the 1980s, the twin deficits were brought under control.
The current balance of payments is now in substantial surplus of about
DKr25bn; more than 2 per cent of GDP. The budget, for a brief period back in
surplus, is in deficit again, but the deficit is relatively small - about
DKr38bn or just over 3 per cent of GDP.
If the Folketing (parliament) so decides, Denmark qualifies as a core member
of the European Economic and Monetary Union, but on present evidence the
Folketing will decide otherwise.
Resolution of the problems caused by the No to Maastricht will remain at the
top of the political agenda for some months, but not to the exclusion of
other issues. The improvement in the external strength of the economy has
yet to be paralleled by reforms which can strengthen the domestic economic
performance. This will be the dominant issue of the 1990s.
There is a feeling in the air that after 10 years with Mr Schluter and the
Liberal Party leader, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister since 1982,
the time for a change may be arriving.
The opposition Social Democratic Party, which dominated Danish politics from
the late 1920s until 1982 and is smarting at its long period in opposition,
changed its leader in April when Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, 48, a former chief
economist at the Trade Union Confederation, was elected leader.
As a person and as a politician, the small centre parties, especially the
Radical Liberals and the Centre Democrats, which are the king-makers in
Danish politics, find him to be a more acceptable candidate for prime
minster than either of his predecessors.
But unless Mr Rasmussen shows willingness to consider radical changes in the
structure of the bloated welfare state - which the party was primarily
responsible for building up - parliamentary support for a change of regime
may evade him, says Mrs Marianne Jelved, the leader of the Radical Party.
Meanwhile, the parties which advocated a Yes to Maastricht - the
Conservative and Liberal government parties plus the Social Democrats, the
Radical Liberals, the Centre Democrats and one half of the Christian
People's Party, representing almost five-sixths of the seats in the
Folketing - have worked out a strategy to ensure that Denmark can
nevertheless remain a fully participating member of the European Community.
Denmark's negotiating position is not without some strength because the
treaty cannot be implemented without the signature of all 12 members.
The reality, however, is that if all the other 11 ratify but Denmark finally
refuses to sign, it will cause considerable inconvenience for the other
members. But the 5.1m Danes will not stop the other governments from going
ahead with a European Union if they are determined to do so.
The government's policy, therefore, is to gain authority to sign the treaty
from a second referendum next year - but with several reservations or
exceptions for Denmark to parts of the treaty.
Mr Schluter has outlined a three-part package as the basis for next year's
referendum.
The first part will consist of an unchanged treaty text. To persuade the
voters to swallow the treaty, two sweeteners will be added.
Part two of the package will be a new agreement between all 12 members
committing the Community to greater openness in its deliberations and
emphasising that the principle of subsidiarity must, as it is intended,
minimise interference from Brussels in the status and authority of national
legislatures.
The third part will consist of special arrangements, or exemptions, for
Denmark.
The detail of the special arrangements which Denmark wants have still to be
hammered out in inter-party negotiations. The Danish proposals will first be
presented in late October or in November in preparation for the Community's
Edinburgh 'summit' meeting in December. But the broad outlines of the Danish
requirements are clear and reflect what the voters on June 2 are deemed to
have objected to most strongly in the Maastricht treaty.
The Danes are uncomfortable with the idea of a common European defence
(other than Nato) and allergic to the idea of a European army, so the first
requirement will be an exemption from Danish participation in a common
European defence policy.
There is strong antipathy to the introduction of a common currency, so the
second requirement will be an assurance that Denmark is not committed to
participation in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union.
Rejection of European citizenship is likely to be another Danish requirement
although, because Denmark allows foreign residents to vote in local
elections, which is the main purpose of introducing European citizenship,
this reservation does not seem to be very weighty.
Two parties advocated a No to Maastricht; the right-wing Progress Party and
the left-wing Socialist People's Party. Ideally, the Yes parties would like
to ensure the support of at least one of the No parties, more especially the
Socialist Peoples Party.
The treaty was defeated primarily because the supporters of the Social
Democratic Party ignored the advice of the party leadership. More than 60
per cent of the party's supporters voted against the treaty. It is felt that
it would reassure left-wing voters if the SPP backed a Yes next time, but Mr
Holger K. Nielsen, the party's leader, is keeping his options open.
If the Danes vote No in a second referendum it will be a tragedy, says Mr
Schluter. Denmark would then have to obtain some kind of associate
membership of the Community. At worst, such a relationship could mean that
the EC refuses to allow Denmark to continue to participate in the common
agricultural and fisheries policies.
Agriculture and the related food processing industries account for about 25
per cent of Denmark's merchandise exports and Denmark is one of the
Community's largest exporters of agricultural products to third countries.
Exclusion from the CAP would therefore have extremely serious economic
consequences for Denmark.

FT  08 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Holiday sector on bid alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLATILITY in the share price of Owners Abroad continued as rumours grew
that a bid would be forthcoming from its rival holiday group Airtours. The
belief in the market is that it is now a matter not of if, but of when an
offer is made, as sources close to both companies indicated that Airtours
was the unnamed company which approached Owners three weeks ago and referred
to in a statement from Owners on Tuesday. The company said that it had
received an approach but that no follow-up had been forthcoming. The two
groups are ranked numbers two and three in the package holiday market with a
combined share of over 30 per cent; a bid would almost certainly attract the
attention of the Office of Fair Trading.
However, Owners is also said to have had talks with the German group LTU,
which bought the Thomas Cook travel chain in June. It is thought that Owners
was discussing a co-operation agreement, rather than a formal alliance. Some
in the market suggested that the German group may become involved as a white
knight in the event of a hostile bid. In the meantime, Owners shares, which
have been propelled on the back of the takeover speculation, fell back as
profit-takers moved in. They ended 6 1/2 off at 70 1/2 in large turnover of
2.9m. Airtours fell 7 to 239p.
Anglian bought deal
The worst individual performance of any Footsie stock came from Anglian
Water, whose shares retreated 13, or just over 3 per cent, to 417p, after
Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French utilities group, disposed of its near 9 per
cent stake in the group.
The stake, some 26.52m shares, was sold by Lyonnaise, in a bought deal
operation, to Cazenove, Anglian Water's broker, and Warburg Securities.
Lyonnaise sold the stock to the two broking firms at 410p a share. The stock
was then placed with institutions at 415p a share, giving the two
participating brokers a 5p a share turn on the deal, or a total profit in
excess of Pounds 1.32m.
The first half of the placing was said to have gone smoothly, although there
were hints that the remainder proved much more difficult than had been
expected. Some institutions, that were said to have taken up their original
allocations were rumoured to have had to sell blocks of other water shares
to enable them to take on more Anglian.
Lyonnaise acquired its holding in Anglian in the immediate aftermath of the
flotation of the 10 water companies in December 1989. It also built up a 6
per cent stake in Wessex Water and a 7 per cent holding in Severn Trent.
Lyonnais sold both these stakes, at a substantial profit, in December 1990,
via bought deals executed by Smith New Court.
The other water stocks in the Footsie suffered accordingly, with Thames
aggressively sold and finally 9 off at 432p, on 2.8m traded, North West 8
lower at 434p and Severn Trent 4 1/2 easier at 392p. Of the smaller
companies, Welsh Water lost 10 to 454p and South West 7 to 425p.
Shell retreat
Shell Transport delivered another disappointing performance, underperforming
the Footsie and the oil sector, after one senior executive from Shell's
chemicals division delivered what was described as a cautious address to
London analysts. Shell said it saw no upturn in its chemicals business until
late 1993.
The presentation was accompanied by a bearish note on Shell issued by County
NatWest. Mr Fergus MacLeod at County said: 'The market's search for security
in the face of turmoil of the past months has pushed Shell's rating up to a
high from which there is little conceivable upside, despite its well known
operational and balance sheet strength. While the uncertainty continues it
will be very difficult for fund managers to decide to lighten holdings, but
the simple fact is that Shell has been over-hyped and is over-priced.' Shell
retreated 9 more to 522p with turnover a hefty 7.3m.
The cautious note struck on the outlook for chemicals held ICI back, the
shares dropping 14 1/2 to 1060 1/2 p.
Enterprise Oil continued to gain ground, racing up 7 more to 422p, with the
Kleinwort buy note and the round of US presentations still finding a ready
response in the market. Lasmo, too, attracted considerable support, moving
up 5 to 161p.
Profit-taking was seen in Unilever as some in the market felt it had had a
good run. Some fund managers switched out of the UK 'plc' shares and into
the Dutch 'nvs', arguing that the latter are at a 5.5 per cent discount to
the plc equivalent. The shares retreated 21 to 1041p.
Scottish supermarket group Shoprite jumped 48 to 587p following recent
presentations by BZW. Asda climbed 2 1/2 to 36 1/2 p as hints were heard
that trading was steady and that one leading broking house would be
upgrading today.
The 4 per cent drop in new car sales during September triggered a series of
profits downgrades in the motor components area of the market. 'It's nothing
but bad news in the car manufacturing business,' said Mr Alistair Stewart at
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the stockbroker. Mr Stewart said he had downgraded his
profits estimates 'across the board' in the sector to allow for the drop in
UK car sales, the problems caused to the German industry by a rampant D-Mark
and the production cuts in the US car industry. The Carr downgrades had an
impact on GKN, 10 lower at 359p, Laird group, 12 off at 259p and Lucas, 4
off at 88p. Dealers said Lucas had bounced off the bottom as a recent large
selling order, apparently executed by Williams de Broe, had been completed.
The market's response to news that General Accident (GenAx)is paying
CDollars 165m for Prudential's Canadian direct general insurance business,
funded by the issue of 13.5m new shares at 588p a share, was to lift GenAx
shares 5 to 510p. Prudential shares moved up 10 to 269p on the news.
BZW's profits' upgrade coincided with a tightening of the market in Standard
Chartered shares, which raced up 31 to 476p on turnover of just 2m shares.
Barclays were again very busy, with 11m shares traded. Dealers said there
had been heavy trading in the options market as well as big activity
generated by the argument over whether a cut in the dividend is on the
cards. The shares rose a penny to 337p.
There was considerable selling by nervous holders of the electricity stocks
ahead of a document expected to be published today by the electricity
industry watchdog (Offer). East Midland, after confirming its interest in
the forthcoming sale of British Coal, dropped 7 to 370p.

FT  08 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VIEW from the derivatives market took a turn for the better yesterday as
the December contract on the FT-SE Index returned to a premium, but volume
remained poor as the markets awaited a lead on UK economic strategy, writes
Terry Byland.
Confidence was not helped by the progress of the Conservative party
conference where government ministers came under pressure.
At the day's peak, the December contract turned back from the 2,571 levels
regarded as an important testing point, and some disappointment was
expressed by futures strategists. However, in late dealings, the December
contract tested this significant benchmark level again, indicating possible
support at today's opening.
December closed at 2,557, a rise of 46 on the previous session and a 9-point
premium to its fair value of around 32. Volume was 9,139 contracts.
Volume in traded options rose sharply, and the final total of 35,995
contracts compared with only 24,648 on Tuesday. The Euro FT-SE contract
recorded 3,993 contracts as traders sought to benefit from trends in
European markets. The FT-SE contract traded 16,152, while Barclays topped
the stock options list with 5,756 contracts in reaction to downgradings from
a French broking house.

FT  08 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Pause for breath in technical rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TECHNICAL rally in the UK stock market was taken a stage further
yesterday, still encouraged by sterling's firmness and by a steady
performance from Wall Street. But some doubts crept in when both the FT-SE
Index and the stock index future contract failed to move above levels
regarded by equity chart analysts as important testing points.
The Footsie recovered another 28.7 points of Monday's 103 point loss, to
close at 2,517.1. Trading volume increased, boosted by a 26.5m share placing
in Anglian Water and the market buzzed with hints that City offices were
alert and that a number of corporate deals were about to be launched.
The Pounds 780m cash bid from Hanson for Ranks Hovis McDougall, followed by
takeover activity in the leisure sector, has re-alerted traders to the
attractions of UK stocks to predators, especially from overseas bidders
which have the additional benefit of sterling's effective devaluation.
Dealers believed yesterday that a German group may be about to take a hand
in the speculative interest in Owners Abroad.
Many of the long-identified bid targets on the Footsie list found themselves
in the frame again yesterday, and speculators were also looking at stocks
just below the market's top 100 stocks.
However, with the UK Conservative government coming under fire at its annual
conference, which will be addressed today by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor of the exchequer, the big investment institutions remained
unwilling to chase shares too vigorously until official strategies on
sterling and interest rates become more clear.
Equities benefited from a firmer tone in stock index futures but the Footsie
topped out at mid-session after moving to within four points of 2,530,
identified by Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon, the UK broker, as the level
at which either the technical recovery will peter out or the market will
stage a renewed advance.
Seaq volume of 545m shares compared with 467.1m on Tuesday. More
significantly, stock exchange data showed that retail or customer business
remained low on Tuesday, with the Pounds 811.5m value figure disappointingly
below the Pounds 1.2bn plus totals recorded daily since sterling quit the
ERM, and the stock market sensed that UK interest rates could be reduced.
Confidence in further cuts in domestic interest rates before the end of the
year remained strong enough to support shares in the consumer and retail
sectors. But shares in those sectors advanced only modestly and investors
sought out bargains rather than chasing prices higher. The best gains came
among the blue chip sectors, although support was very selective, and no
longer based merely on currency considerations.
Glaxo, out of favour with UK investors recently, found renewed support from
the US, although interest died away at the close as trade in New York
appeared subdued. The chemical sector was unsettled by bearish reports from
a presentation to analysts in London by the chemical division of Shell.

FT  08 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls after wave of
program selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER a quiet opening, US share prices tumbled in late trading yesterday on
a wave of program selling and a big drop in bond prices, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.94 at 3,152.25,
near its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also
ended lower, down 2.91 at 404.27, while the Amex composite eased 0.83 to
366.88 and the Nasdaq composite gave up all of its early gains to finish
1.36 lower at 569.19. Turnover on the NYSE was 184m shares. Although
investors were disappointed that the Fed did not ease monetary policy after
its monthly open market committee meeting on Tuesday, prices were supported
yesterday by continued, if sporadic, bargain-hunting as investors went in in
search of bargains after the recent sell-off.
The overall mood of the market, however, remained downbeat. The Dow has lost
almost 120 points in the last five trading days, and investors are reluctant
to invest heavily in stocks for fear of being caught out by an unexpectedly
poor third quarter reporting season, which starts next week.
It was no surprise, therefore, when a combination of a big fall in bond
prices and program selling pushed prices sharply lower in the last hour of
trading.
Among individual stocks, Ford fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 in busy
trading after analysts at the broking houses, Bear Stearns and Salomon
Brothers, cut their 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates for the car
manufacturer, citing rising costs and a poor outlook for European sales.
Perkin-Elmer dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 29 1/2 even though it said the
acquisition of Applied Biosystems in a Dollars 330m stock-swap would not
significantly dilute operating earnings in the first year. News of the
takeover lifted Applied Biosystems Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 19 3/8 .
The drugs sector was boosted in early trading by reports that fund managers
were picking up drug stocks after their recent declines, but prices fell
back with the wider market in the final hour. Among those to benefit most
were Johnson &amp; Johnson, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 45 1/2 , Pfizer, up
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 72 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dollars  7/8 higher
at Dollars 63 1/4 , and Eli Lilly, up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 60 1/8 .
Federated Department Stores climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 15 after
securities house Lehman Brothers raised its earnings estimate for the
retailer in anticipation of better than expected September comparable-stores
sales.
Medtronic, in strong demand lately and approaching its 52-week high, ran
into profit-taking and fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 94 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Premier Bancorp firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 3/4
after the regional banking group announced third quarter net income of 49
cents a share, up sharply from the 21 cents a share earned a year ago.
Pyramid Technology fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 6 3/4 on news of cost-cutting
measures which will leave the company with a fourth-quarter charge of
between Dollars 22m and Dollars 24m and an overall net loss for the final
period of the year.
Canada
TORONTO SHARES fell out of a narrow trading range late in the session to end
lower.
The composite index slipped 14.13 points or 0.44% to 3,215.36, with 278
declining issues against 243 advances. Volume was 33.38m shares against
28.554m and trading value was CDollars 376.7m.
The mining sector showed the largest swing among the sub-groups, down 1.71%
on index, while industrial products fell 1.24%.

FT  08 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Lower interest rates lift
financial stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EASIER interest rates lifted financial stocks yesterday, though industrial
recession in Europe and a firmer dollar continued to mark cyclical and
dollar-sensitive stocks yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was cheered by some good interim results and bargain-hunting in
over-sold blue chips. The CAC-40 index ended 41.64 or 2.58 per cent higher
at 1,654.15 on turnover of FFr2.82bn, of which FFr609m was generated in
Printemps.
Shares in Au Printemps, the department store, were re-quoted at FFr780, up
FFr130 or 20 per cent, the price offered by Pinault to buy out minority
shareholders. The shares were suspended on September 22.
Societe Generale rose FFr30.80 or 6.4 per cent to FFr514 after pleasing the
market with its interim results, released shortly before the close.
But Paribas slumped FFr12.80 or 4.4 per cent to FFr278.30 on reports of
serious losses at Ciments Francais, in which the bank has a 34 per cent
stake. The stock fell on speculation that Paribas would have to pay
compensation to Italcementi of Italy, which is in the process of buying a
controlling stake in the French cement group. Shares in Ciments Francais
were suspended.
UAP jumped FFr29 or 8.4 per cent to FFr375, amid rumours that it was
planning to raise its industrial insurance premiums by 20 per cent.
FRANKFURT ran the twin themes - banks strong, carmakers weak - which have
given its equity market some character since the ERM realignment and the
reduction in German interest rates on September 14.
A 7 per cent drop in nine-month sales at Daimler's Mercedes-Benz car
division, and talk of a downgrade to nil in Warburg's 1993 earnings forecast
for Volkswagen, left Daimler DM3.50 lower at DM522, and Volkswagen DM5.70
down at DM252.90.
Banks posted strong gains on the recovery in the Bunds, and recurrent talk
of a downward trend in German interest rates. Deutsche Bank rose DM12.30 to
DM632.80, Dresdner by DM7.50 to DM345.50 and Commerzbank by DM4.50 to DM238.
Since September 14 the banks have lost less than 1 per cent on a crude
average, compared with 16 per cent for the big three carmakers and 10 per
cent for the DAX index, which rose 15.70 to 1,436.05 yesterday.
ZURICH, lifted by lower Swiss interest rates and the firmer dollar, saw the
SMI index rise 37.7 or 2.1 per cent to 1,858.2.
In financials, Union Bank rose SFr24 to SFr790 and CS Holding by SFr55 to
SFr1,975; among insurers, Winterthur gained SFr80 at SFr2,830 and Zurich
SFr45 at SFr1,945. Pharmaceuticals featured a SFr110 rise to SFr3,530 in
Roche certificates and SFr12 to SFr625 for Ciba Geigy bearers.
Heavy industry was weak but the South African-controlled Richemont rose
SFr90 to SFr1,050 following this week's implementation of its 10-for-one
stock split.
MILAN continued its rebound on hopes that the recent drop in the lira would
improve the outlook for Italian exports. The Comit index rose 8.82 to 369.93
in turnover estimated at around Tuesday's L129bn. Fiat was fixed 5.8 per
cent or L205 higher at L3,755 and Stet recovered another 7.4 per cent or L80
to L1,160.
Italmobiliare and its cement group, Italcementi, were suspended by Consob.
AMSTERDAM remained subdued as the CBS Tendency index edged up 0.1 at 107.8.
Royal Dutch was affected by a downgrading of Shell UK and closed down 30
cents at Fl 141.90 while a sell note on Unilever took it Fl 1.70 lower to Fl
181.60.
MADRID made ground as domestic banks bought across the board. The general
index gained 3.65 to 186.80. Good volumes were noted in Ibredrola I, up
Pta27 at Pta557, and Union Fenosa, Pta4 better at Pta354.
STOCKHOLM rose as an easing in marginal lending rates from 20 per cent to 18
per cent drew foreign investors into the market. The Affarsvarlden General
index rose 12.4 to 655.5 in turnover of SKr394m.
Ericsson B and Astra free shares dominated trading, gaining SKr4 to SKr105
and SKr5 to SKr503. But Volvo free shares shed SKr11 to SKr214. Some
analysts attributed the fall to weak European car demand.
BRUSSELS closed mostly higher, in line with other European markets. The
Bel-20 index rose 8.93 to 1,077.15. Societe Generale de Belgique, which on
Tuesday reported a 6.3 per cent fall in first half net, was one of the day's
biggest gainers, climbing BFr50 or 2.8 per cent to BFr1,810.
HELSINKI's banks recovered some of the sharp losses they sustained earlier
this week, the banks and finance index rising 13.1 per cent as the Hex index
rose 9.1, or 1.5 per cent to 612.2.
VIENNA's ATX index rose 2.98 to 771.53 but Lenzing, the textile and fibre
manufacturer, went against the trend, slipping Sch9 to Sch619 after warning
that the dividend may be cut this year.

FT  08 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Kuwait marks symbolic return of equity
trading - But it may take six months before transactions return to former
levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S stock exchange, which closed with a bang in the Iraqi invasion of
August 1990, has reopened with a whimper.
Since its doors were reopened on September 28, the market has seen a little
under 80 transactions a day in no more than a dozen shares. So few stocks
are being traded that the Al-Shall agency, which provided the market's index
before the war, is publishing only a temporary index of the six most traded
shares. In the first week this showed a 22.4 per cent slump in prices.
According to Mr Jassem al-Saddoun, Al-Shall's managing director, it will
take six months before the market returns to an approximation of its former
self - the Gulf's biggest market with a capitalisation of around Dollars
3.4bn. 'It will take that long for the market to assess the new government,
the state of the economy and the social and political conditions in Kuwait,'
he says.
But it is likely to take far longer than that before trading on the exchange
does anything like justice to its setting: a cavernous brown marble edifice
which is among the most imposing of Kuwait's commercial buildings.
Although the building's fabric survived the Iraqi invasion essentially
unscathed, the havoc caused by the Gulf war to Kuwait's financial and
economic system meant that it took 19 months before it was able to reopen
its glass doors.
That is how long it took the 31 companies now quoted to produce acceptable
accounts. A further 21 companies are still untangling the financial mess
caused by the invasion and Mr Hisham al-Otaibi, the exchange's president,
reckons that it will be early next year before the full complement of
pre-war stocks are back on the market's board.
However, once all 52 companies regain their listing, Kuwait's stock exchange
will find itself on its firmest footing for a decade - the result of the
government's decision earlier this year to clear the financial system of
billions of dollars worth of debts resulting both from the Gulf war and the
disastrous 1982 collapse of the informal and unregulated Souq al Manakh kerb
stock market.
The collapse of the Manakh market, which had soared unsustainably on rampant
share speculation paid for largely by post-dated cheques, had left Kuwait's
banks and investment houses shackled with a total of KD1.9bn (Dollars 570m)
worth of unpaid debts on their books even before the Gulf war. The war
itself has made KD3.8bn worth of business and consumer loans by the
financial institutions go sour.
Earlier this year, the government agreed to take on all these debts, buying
them from the banks and investment companies in a massive one-off sale of
government bonds. The banks, and scores of other companies, were therefore
able not only to produce accounts, but more soundly-based accounts than they
had been able to publish since 1982.
Even so, it is likely to take years before the stock market recovers fully
from the double shock of the Manakh and the Gulf war. The Manakh crisis, in
particular, has left the market badly out of kilter.
For one thing, government bail-outs resulting from the crisis have left it
in possession of around 60 per cent of the total shares in issue. For
another, the only bank of Kuwait's six commercial institutions that remained
profitable after the Manakh crisis, National Bank of Kuwait, became such a
Goliath blue chip that its stock alone accounts for 30 per cent of the
market's capitalisation. Since the market's reopening, NBK stock has
accounted for 64 per cent of all transactions.
A full revival of the market will also await the recuperation of the
economy, the private sector of which has been crippled both by the direct
effects of the Iraqi troops' vandalism and the indirect effects of the
government's decision to try to halve the pre-war population of 2.2m.
Given the exchange's limping start and its dependence on a broader economic
recovery, many believe that reopening was essentially symbolic. 'Whenever
the stock market is working normally, Kuwait is working normally, is the
thinking,' says Mr Saddoun. 'It is more of a psychological event than an
economic one.'
A full revival of the market will also await the recuperation of Kuwait's
economy, the private sector of which has been crippled both by the direct
effects of the Iraqi troops' vandalism and the indirect effects of the
government's decision to try to halve the pre-war population

FT  08 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Program selling leaves
Nikkei lower again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROGRAM selling in the late afternoon eroded earlier gains and left share
prices lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 156.36 to 17,111.74, the day's low, having firmed
initially on buying by individuals, and index-linked purchases by investment
trusts, rising to the day's high of 17,531.09 in early afternoon trading.
Volume remained thin at 230m shares against 235m. Advances led declines by
528 to 370 with 173 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
dipped just 0.04 to 1,299.09 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
1.66 to 1034.93.
In spite of small-lot buying by public investment funds, leading investors
failed to follow suit.
The government's stock market support measures, announced with the emergency
fiscal support package, included suppression of supply by guiding financial
institutions to refrain from heavy selling, and by halting new share offers.
On the demand side, an extra Y1,120bn was added to the original figure of
Y5,680bn of public funds scheduled for investment.
Now, following the interim closing of books at September 30, small-lot
selling has emerged as authorities have loosened their grip on sellers.
Worries over corporate earnings affected some high-technology issues. NEC,
down Y4 at Y691, was one company affected by reports of lower earnings for
the fiscal year.
Showa Denko, the chemical company, rose Y6 to Y290 on reports that it will
forge product development links with Asahi Chemical Industry, which advanced
Y4 to Y600.
Pharmaceuticals were firm, with Nikken Chemicals gaining Y30 to Y1,040 and
Takeda Chemical adding Y30 to Y1,180. Both issues were popular on their
research into drugs for Alzheimer's disease.
Short-term speculators targeted Kubota, the most active issue of the day,
which rose Y30 to Y597. It was bought on the environmental and public works
theme; some investors hope that an increase in environmental and public
works projects will increase demand for its plumbing systems.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 190.25 to 18,948.97 in volume of 7.3m shares.
Roundup
ANY rally in Pacific Rim markets yesterday appeared to be short-lived.
HONG KONG reversed early losses to finish higher as bargain-hunters used
Governor Chris Patten's maiden policy speech as an excuse to buy. The Hang
Seng Index was up 35.91 at 5,589.03, having touched a low of 5,498.07
earlier in the session. Turnover fell to HKDollars 1.47bn from HKDollars
1.74bn.
Blue chips, which had suffered the greatest losses on Tuesday and earlier in
the day, rebounded considerably, with Cheung Kong gaining 10 cents to
HKDollars 20.50 and HSBC Holdings adding 50 cents to HKDollars 55.50.
SINGAPORE's brief rally ended abruptly as cautious investors sold off shares
in late afternoon trading. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 0.89 to
1,331.67 in volume of only 25.64m shares.
SEOUL rose on active intervention by institutional investors and the
Securities Stabilisation Fund. The index gained 16.62 to 524.38 but brokers
said the rally could be short-lived.
TAIWAN ended off its highs as investors took quick profits from early gains.
The weighted index 29.25 higher at 3,592.12 in turnover of TDollars 13.1bn.
MANILA finished lower in slow trading as a downturn in major overseas
markets continued to dampen sentiment. The composite index slipped 9.98 to
1,407.80 in combined turnover of 336m pesos after 367m.
KUALA LUMPUR fell in the afternoon on renewed selling as investors remained
concerned about the market's near-term direction. The composite index ended
down 0.11 at 590.59 after standing 2.47 higher at midday, in volume of 61.9m
shares.
AUSTRALIA's early rally ran out of steam in the afternoon, leaving shares
only slightly higher on the day. The All Ordinaries index closed 3.0 higher
at 1,455.4. Turnover was light at ADollars 219.7m. NEW ZEALAND was hindered
by Carter Holt Harvey, whose 7 cent fall to NZDollars 2.37 was the main
reason for the 3.95 point fall in the NZSE-40 index to 1,392.31. Turnover
was NZDollars 19m. Donaghys gained 15 cents to NZDollars 3.20 after news of
its one-for-10 scrip issue.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut hopes build
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONGER performance by sterling and hopes of a cut in German interest
rates caused rates to ease on the UK money market yesterday, writes Neil
Buckley.
Actions by the Bundesbank put further downward pressure on German money
market rates. German call money closed down at 8.90 per cent from a recent 9
per cent.
With the Bundesbank injecting a net DM2.8bn into the German banking system -
more than expected - via a 14-day securities repurchase pact, one dealer
said it was 'actively pushing rates down'.
'It could be heralding a German rate cut,' he added.
With sterling building on Tuesday's rally against the D-mark, there was
renewed optimism in the UK market that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
might be able to reduce UK base rates.
'Hopes of a rate cut will not disappear from the market now unless sterling
really does come down very sharply,' one London dealer said.
Traders were also encouraged by reports that Mr Lamont was preparing to make
a statement on the government's new economic policy at the Conservative
party's conference in Brighton today.
The key three month interbank rate - the best indicator of the future
direction of interest rates - fell to 8 15/16 per cent from a previous close
of 9 1/8 per cent, showing dealers' confidence that a base rate cut is in
the offing before the end of the year. One-month money also eased to 9 3/16
per cent from 9 5/16 per cent.
The December short sterling contract closed up three basis points at 91.85,
although it had earlier touched a high of 91.90. Dealers said, however, they
would expect the contract to be considerably above 92.00 if a rate cut was
thought to be imminent.
There were few problems with day-to-day funding. The Bank of England
initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m, but this was twice revised, to
reach Pounds 1bn. An early round of help injected Pounds 630m into the
system, in the form of bills for resale to the market on November 2 at 8
15/16 per cent.
Later purchases totalling Pounds 352m of band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent
took the daily total to Pounds 982m - only Pounds 18m below the target.
Overnight rates fell as low as 8 per cent but firmed to 9 per cent at the
close.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Small rally in pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pound rallied in early trading, but the market was unconvinced that
gains against the D-Mark represented a shift in attitude towards the
currency, writes Emma Tucker.
Much of sterling's recovery reflected technical manoeuvrings as traders
closed short positions ahead of an address by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, to the Conservative Party conference today. Traders were not
certain he would give a firm indication on the future shape of UK economic
policy but in the absence of any other statements will be fixed to their
television screens when he speaks today at noon.
'I don't think the strengthening of sterling is a sign that institutional
investors are going to turn around and start buying gilts and UK shares,'
said Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew.
Mr Ifty Islam, currency economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said:
'Sterling's move doesn't reflect any change in the fundamental view of the
UK and that will continue until we get a slightly firmer policy statement.'
The pound closed in London at DM2.4725, up two and half pfennigs on the day.
Against the dollar it closed at Dollars 1.7170 marginally higher than the
previous day's close.
In European trading the dollar benefited from the Federal Reserve's decision
not to announce a cut in the discount rate at its federal open markets
committee meeting and from softer German money rates.
German call money remained at 8.95 per cent after the Bundesbank injected
more liquidity into the system than had been expected. Opinion was divided
over whether this represented a signal from the German central bank that it
was shifting its monetary stance, or whether the easing was temporary. The
dollar rallied in late trading to close up a pfennig at DM1.4400.
The lira also benefited from the slight weakening of the D-Mark across the
foreign exchanges, and edged up against the German currency. Many traders
felt the sharp movements in the lira on the previous day had been excessive.
There were also fewer scares about the reintroduction of exchange controls
flying around the markets. The lira closed at L905 against the D-Mark, up
sharply on the previous day's close of L916.2.
Like the pound, however, the outlook for the Italian currency remains
uncertain. The market is particularly worried about the possible rejection
of the budget package by the Italian parliament.
The Swiss franc tumbled through chart support against the dollar to end
sharply lower against the big currencies.
Easier Swiss franc money market rates and news that big Swiss banks had cut
rates on their cash bonds weakened the Swiss currency further. It closed
against the dollar at SFr1.2585.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese congress expected to
liberalise grain market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 14th Chinese Communist Party congress next week is expected to move away
from state control of agriculture and endorse the use of free markets in
grain, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Diplomats and foreign grain traders expect the government to allow farmers
to have more freedom over what to grow. It could also give up its monopoly
of the grain trade, allowing domestic private traders to conduct business in
China for the first time.
'We hear the congress will decide to liberalise the grain trade -
decentralise it completely,' one Asian trader said.
A Western economist said: 'The farmers could find themselves free to choose
what to grow and where to sell it.'
The move is expected because recent bumper crops in some provinces have led
to tonnes of grain rotting in the open because of inadequate storage, while
other areas have had to import because the transport network cannot get the
grain where it is needed.
The country is expecting this year's harvest of grain - China's main crop -
to reach a record 440m tonnes.
Farmers have suffered from bumper crops because the state-set price for
grain drops, and they have turned away from the crucial grain staples to
farm lucrative cash crops, frustrating the national planners. Millions of
farmers have also left the land to seek jobs in factories.
Vice Premier Tian Jiyun earlier this year called for an end to the
government's monopoly on grain purchasing and marketing. He said state
control should only be used as an expedient during periods of shortage.
Mr Tian proposed setting up more grain wholesale markets nationwide and
experimenting with measures on how to make grain supply management
market-sensitive.
Earlier this year, Guangdong province became the first region to free grain
prices from government control. Fujian and Jiangsu provinces have since come
close to complete deregulation.

<TEXT>
PLATINUM was fixed at its lowest level for nearly a month in London in the
afternoon at Dollars 356.75 a troy ounce, before recovering ground to the
Dollars 358 area in late trading. The market declined early on bearish
technicals, but the fall gathered pace after sales by a US investment bank
as traders focused on a deteriorating economic background. Dealers believe
platinum now might be reflecting the falls in base metal markets, where
prices have been depressed by fading hopes of global economic recovery. GOLD
closed just ahead at Dollars 350.75 a troy ounce. The recent decline in LME
BASE METALS showed some sign of petering out, which encouraged some modest
buying to emerge, and prices closed mixed. But the trend mostly reflected
short covering and technical buying, with consumer interests unwilling to
chase the markets higher. COPPER finished steady, building on Tuesday's
bounce off three-month lows, but showed little inclination to move
significantly above Dollars 2,300 a tonne for three-month metal. Three-month
ZINC moved back above Dollars 1,200 a tonne in the afternoon after briefly
equalling Tuesday's seven-month low of Dollars 1,195 a tonne.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike the currencies in which it is traded, wool is maintaining steady
price levels in the primary markets. There have been good clearances in
Australia this week, with Japan the leading buyer. The relative firmness
does not, however, indicate buoyancy in user industries or consumer markets.
Price changes in the UK market for tops are again due more to currency
movements than to any shift in market conditions. Business is very quiet and
the only signs of real improvement are on the export front.

keep prices low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are several new nickel mines in development in Norilsk in Russia, with
good enough grades to offset depletion of some of the area's high-grade
deposits, geologists have told a seminar in Sudbury, Ontario.
Norilsk's production of nickel will remain flat for the near future if
productivity is maintained. Reserves are estimated at 70 years' production,
they said.
Russia is now shipping about 100,000 tonnes of primary nickel to the West
yearly, or 15 per cent of total supply, plus some scrap.
Canadian analysts said the Russian statements suggested a recovery in nickel
prices is some distance away.
Earlier this week, Inco, the western world's biggest nickel producer,
announced production cuts of 18,000 tonnes in 1993, equal to about 3 per
cent of annual western consumption. It blamed Russian exports and a fall in
stainless steel production.
Falconbridge is expected to announce cuts next week, but a significant gap
between supply and demand is expected to continue.
On the London Metal Exchange yesterday, nickel recovered some of its recent
losses. Three-month metal built on support above Dollars 6,700 a tonne and
the possibility that other nickel producers might follow Inco and take
measures to cut production.

TAIWAN'S gold imports plunged almost 40 per cent in September from August
because of falling demand from industry and individual investors, the
Finance Ministry said, Reuter reports.
September imports were 9.31 tonnes worth Dollars 102m (Pounds 57.30m)
compared with 15.45 tonnes worth Dollars 174m in August.
Higher prices cut demand from the jewellery and electronics industries but
imports are expected to rise before the Chinese New Year.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC proposes using satellites to
spy on fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday proposed using spy satellites to track
fishing vessels suspected of breaching quotas in EC waters.
Surveillance of all boats longer than 10m in length would be phased in from
early next year to the end of 1995, according to the Commission.
The idea is to strengthen monitoring of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to
protect depleted fish stocks in the face of 'chronic overcapacity' of EC
fleets, an EC official said.
In addition, the Commission would like to introduce a new licence regime for
fishing vessels, applicable to all boats at high sea and in Community and
third country waters.
The new licensing regime will apply to all Community and foreign vessels
operating in EC waters. The principle of reserved access inside the 12-mile
limit would remain intact.
In line with the new emphasis in Brussels on 'subsidiarity' - devolving
decision-making to the lowest appropriate level - the Commission stressed
that member states will be responsible for operating the proposed new
regime. However, Commission inspectors would ensure that the CFP rules are
applied equitably throughout the Community.
Separately, Mr Manuel Marin, the Spanish Commissioner responsible for the
CFP, appears to have retreated from his plan for the Commission to decide
the annual break-down of fishing quotas and the total allowable catch (TAC).
This would have implied a transfer of power from the Council, a course not
acceptable in the present political climate where any move by the Commission
to extend its authority is viewed with suspicion.
A Commission official said yesterday that the rules needed to be tightened
because it was clear that the regime operating since 1983 was not adequate.
The Commission proposals will be considered in detail at a meeting of EC
fishery ministers on October 19. The Commission hopes that the new rules
will take effect from 1 January 1993 when the current regime expires.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Slimmer leopard tries to change
its spots - Damian Fraser talks to Francisco Rojas, head of Pemex, Mexico's
state oil company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Francisco Rojas is an unlikely head of the world's fifth largest, and
almost certainly most politicised, oil company. A public accountant by
training and nature, he had never worked for an oil company, or in the
higher levels of the private sector, or held elective office, when he was
appointed head of Pemex in February 1987. He had spent practically all his
working life supervising government spending in the budget and finance
ministries.
But it was precisely the qualities of a politically loyal, tight-fisted
bureaucrat that endeared him to the then president, Mr Miguel de la Madrid,
and subsequently to his successor, Mr Carlos Salinas. Pemex, and its union,
had a well-deserved reputation for woeful inefficiency, corruption, and
over-manning. Mr Rojas was under orders to cut out the fat.
That is just what he has done. The Pemex union has been destroyed, and from
being one of the most powerful in Mexico, is now probably the weakest. The
collective labour contract has been re-written, giving management carte
blanche to do as it likes. Mr Rojas expects to have slashed the workforce to
125,000 this year, from 210,000 workers in 1987.
The company, which explores, produces, refines, and sells oil, gas and
petrochemicals, reckons it has cut operating costs by some 20 per cent since
1986. At same time, oil production is around 2.67m barrels a day, up from
2.51m b/d in 1987, while refining capacity has increased.
With labour reforms under his belt, Mr Rojas is now concentrating on the
restructuring of Pemex into a corporate holding company and four
subsidiaries - exploration and production, refining, gas and basic
petrochemicals and petrochemicals. While formally announced a few months
ago, the restructuring is the culmination of a long-term (and arguably
unachievable) plan: to turn Pemex into a profitable, international oil
company, without admitting competition on to its home turf.
'The fundamental philosophy' says Mr Rojas 'is the management of all
operations under commercial and international terms . . . We have developed
a system of prices that we are going to apply across all inter-company
contracts.' Under the new system, cross-subsidies between subsidiaries will
be removed, and thus the performance of each subsidiary can be easily
evaluated.
While a system of transfer prices has been tried before, Mr Rojas says it
will now be easier. 'Before we had to have a system of transfer prices that
was unreal, detached, separated from real accounting of transactions between
divisions; today we have companies and commercial prices. That is one, that
is a huge difference we are dealing with.'
Each division will have to publish its results separately, which will be
compared with those of international companies. Mr Rojas suggests that
eventually investment in a division will depend on its profitability, and
thus on the probable return on capital.
Pemex will start this strategy with the petrochemicals division (the only
one open to the private sector). Petrochemical plants that are not
profitable will be closed, or sold off; those that are, may receive capital.
In this way the efficient parts (by international standards) of Pemex could
grow, and the inefficient parts be left to fold. An incentive to be
competitive would have been established.
The restructuring is above all intended to force Pemex middle management to
change its way of thinking. In the past, says Mr Rojas, 'there was no
criteria of the maximisation of profits, there was no business criteria in
the activities of Pemex. What they demanded of Pemex was that it supply
effectively all the hydrocarbon needs of the nation and there is no doubt it
did it. No doubt.
'Now we have changed. We not only want supplies, but we want international
supplies at international competitive prices. Thus we need not only to be
effective, but efficient. This is the change in which we are emerged . . .
not only thinking how to do things in engineering terms but how engineering
things are profitable in business terms.'
Of course as long as Pemex remains a monopoly, efficient business-like parts
of the company would have to continue relying on the inefficient parts of
the chain for providing basic services. In part to overcome this weakness,
Mr Rojas is at the same time forcing Pemex to contract out more and more
work to domestic and foreign drilling and construction firms. A host of
foreign firms are drilling for oil or building platforms for cash (not
prohibited by the constitution); others are bidding to build refineries.
Eventually - although Mr Rojas was even vaguer than usual on this -
subsidiaries of Pemex might have to compete against private-sector companies
to win the business of another arm of Pemex. If so, the Pemex monopoly in
effect would have crumbled.
While industry observers of Pemex tend to applaud such declarations of Mr
Rojas, many remain sceptical. Mr Rojas fought tooth and nail against
Mexico's trade ministry to avoid making oil concessions to the US in the
North American Free Trade Agreement. Unlike many members of Mexico's
government, he appears to be a true believer in the merits of a national,
state oil industry.
Mr Rojas thus appointed a member of the old guard at Pemex to run
exploration and production, the most important division. Mr Rojas remains
head of the board of each of the four divisions of Pemex, belying the
decentralisation of power the new regime is supposed to encourage. The Pemex
holding company will continue to allocate resources, evaluate results, and
set company strategy for its four subsidiaries.
But Mr Rojas is like all Mexican government officials above all a loyal
servant to his president. His given role is to restructure rather than
dismantle Pemex, and cut its costs. And in that job, narrow as it may be, he
is usually given high marks.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Belgian and Dutch bonds in favour after
rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian and Dutch government bond markets were in favour yesterday as
both countries cut key short-term interest rates, echoing a similar easing
by the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
The Belgian National Bank reduced its seven-day special advances rate by 10
basis points to 8.9 per cent, while the Dutch authorities cut their
intervention rate to the same level.
Both were reacting to the strength of their currencies, and followed the 10
basis point cut in the latest German repurchase agreement (or repo) tender.
Money market rates in Germany have now moved down 30 basis points since the
devaluation of the lira and 80 basis points since early September.
Dealers said that a Belgian cut had already been factored into bond prices
but there was considerable switching out of Germany, and the spread against
the bund continued to narrow.
One dealer said the spread had dropped from 112 basis points to 93 points
since Tuesday morning and expected traders to start taking profits. The
Belgian benchmark 10-year government bond firmed 30 basis points to 102.27,
with the yield falling to 8.39 per cent.
Dutch bonds opened slightly easier in sympathy with the German market, but
speculation that Amsterdam would follow the Belgian rate cut encouraged
demand. Then, in late trading, the Dutch central bank said it had lowered
its special advances money market rate to 8.9 per cent from 9 per cent for a
five-day liquidity pact it will launch at tender today.
Subscriptions to the new special advances pact were expected to be open
first thing this morning and allocations were to be announced shortly
afterwards.
The new liquidity pact will replace a three-day facility of Fl 2.5bn
expiring before the start of trade today. The Dutch 10-year benchmark bond
ended the day much as it had begun - it showed a slight fall of 8 basis
points at 103.36.
IN the German government bond market, cash bund prices slipped one-third of
a point as traders took profits after the recent strong rally.
There was also some drag on the government bond from an auction of new
10-year 7.25 per cent bunds which raised DM3.92bn. Dealers were said to be
moving into cash, Dutch guilders or Belgian francs.
There was some selling of longer-dated bonds and pressure in the futures
market after a large German bank was said to have started unloading bund
futures. The bund future on Liffe ended the day at 91.04, down from
Tuesday's close of 91.38.
LONG gilts bounced back after a protracted period of weakness, showing a
one-point rise as the market pinned its hopes on a keynote speech from the
UK chancellor of the exchequer due today.
Mr Norman Lamont is to address the Tory Party conference and, although
conference speeches tend to be occasions for bland encouragement to the
party faithful, dealers hope that the seriousness of the present economic
situation will prompt a more pointed response.
Nevertheless, dealers said the risks inherent in remaining outside the ERM,
and the possibility of a jump in the inflation rate, ensured that it was
unlikely the yield spread against bunds would narrow significantly from its
present level above 200 basis points.
There was also some switching out of shorter-dated gilts. The long-dated
benchmark gilt gained over a point to 96 1/4 , while the long gilt future
opened three-quarters of a percentage point higher and traded strongly all
day, reaching a high of 95 13/16 . The December short sterling futures
contract was steady around 91.82, with the market looking for interest rates
of 8.25 per cent by the end of the year.
FRANCE drew encouragement from hints by the Bundesbank's chief economist
that Germany was working to ease rates.
Mr Otmar Issing warned against placing too much reliance on near-term German
M3 money supply data - hitherto the leading indicator used by the German
monetary authorities. In addition, he said it was regrettable that financial
markets had apparently underestimated the decline in short-term German rates
over the past three weeks.
French bonds firmed one-third of a point, and the spread against the bund
had narrowed by 8 basis points by midday. However, a fall in bund prices in
the afternoon caused OATs to shed much of their gains.
US TREASURY prices fell sharply for the second day running yesterday on a
poor seven-year auction and continued disappointment that the Federal
Reserve had not cut interest rates.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  27/32 at 97
3/16 , yielding 7.480 per cent. The two-year note was also weaker, down  1/4
at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.867 per cent.
Expectations of an interest rate cut were high at the start of the week but,
after the Fed failed to act following Tuesday's open market committee
meeting, hopes for a rate cut dwindled rapidly, forcing many investors who
had bought bonds in anticipation of a policy ease to unload their recently
acquired stock.
Prices were also depressed by unexpectedly weak demand for the Dollars
9.75bn of seven-year notes auctioned in the afternoon.

Although the amount of shares to be offered is yet to be finalised, they
will include A shares, which are for domestic investors, and B shares
reserved for overseas investors, according to an official report. The shares
will be listed on stock exchanges in Shenzhen and Shanghai.
An official of the Fujian Trust and Investment Corporation of the People's

FT  08 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Buyers start to respond to wide yield
spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dramatic widening of Eurodollar bond spreads slowed yesterday as
investors started to buy paper again. The differential between Eurodollar
bond yields and US Treasury yields has widened by about 30 basis points
since last month. Dealers said spreads were at their widest point since
early 1990, having reached historically tight levels earlier this year.
For example, Ontario's Dollars 2bn five-year issue launched last month at a
spread of 48 basis points over the comparable Treasury yield is now trading
at a spread of 77 basis points.
However, deals in the secondary market appeared to have found some support
yesterday, mainly provided by asset-swapping. At these wider spreads, bank
investors can swap fixed-rate bonds for floating-rate assets at attractive
margins above the London interbank offered rate. For example, Italy's 8 3/4
per cent bonds due 2001, currently yielding some 126 points over the US
Treasury yield curve, can be swapped into floating-rate assets which pay
around 85 basis points above Libor.
The turmoil in the world's currency and other financial markets, which has
encouraged investors to pull back, lies behind the deterioration in Eurobond
spreads. But other factors are at work.
In particular, last month's change in Italian tax rules - which means that
Eurobonds issued by Italy, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank
no longer command favourable terms in the repo market - loosed billions of
dollars of bonds on an already soggy secondary bond market.
The tax rules had caused such Eurobonds to trade at artificially tight
spreads, which in turn had held in spreads of other sovereign and
supranational paper.
Further, the expectation of a surge in issuance by European sovereign
borrowers needing to replenish foreign exchange reserves has also depressed
sentiment.
In the floating-rate sector, Asfinag, the Austrian railway, launched at
Dollars 200m five-year issue of notes, via UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Elsewhere, Chrysler Credit Canada launched the first Eurobond issue backed
by Canadian assets. The CDollars 300m deal, backed by loans made by Chrysler
to car dealers, was arranged by Morgan Stanley. The deal is privately placed
and details are undisclosed.

FT  08 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: CFTC confirmed as US futures
market regulator - Laurie Morse on new rules and exclusions passed by
Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a three-and-a-half-year battle, the US Commodity Futures Trading
Commission is finally about to get a new lease of life. The Futures Trading
Practices Act is set to pass into law this week, reauthorising the regulator
for another two years.
Congress voted in favour of the bill - one of the few important pieces of
securities legislation this year - on Friday, with the the Senate expected
to ratify it later this week.
Besides confirming the CFTC as regulator of the US futures exchanges, the
bill specifically excludes over-the-counter swap and hybrids markets from
the CFTC's remit. It also introduces stronger protections for customers of
US futures exchanges.
In an interview, Mrs Wendy Gramm, chairwoman, said the bill would bolster US
competitiveness in global derivative markets, and would allow US futures
exchanges to uphold their reputation as financial innovators.
Mrs Gramm spoke strongly in favour of free markets that have a minimum of
regulation. 'What this (Act) does first is put to rest uncertainty in the
regulatory system internationally. Now we can all focus on developing
innovative new products,' she said.
'One thing is that it gives us more flexibility. We will be able to provide
appropriate exemptions for certain products. This is important because we
don't want to stifle innovation,' she added.
The legislation affirms previous CFTC rulings that over-the-counter
instruments such as swaps and hybrid instruments are not futures, and so are
not subject to CFTC supervision.
Mrs Gramm rejects claims that this leaves the OTC markets totally
unsupervised. 'They may not be regulated directly by a government agency,
but the banks and other institutions trading these products often are
regulated,' she said.
According to Mrs Gramm, the exemptions in the bill will also allow US
futures exchanges more freedom to develop new products and trading systems
without regulatory hinderances.
In the past, for example, CFTC rules requiring futures trades be made openly
and competitively had hindered exchanges who wished to implement block
trading procedures in their stock index futures pits. The Chicago Mercantile
Exchange did manage, after long negotiation with the CFTC, to design large
order execution procedures for its S&amp;P 500 stock index futures. Under the
new rules, those procedures can be made less cumbersome, and might apply to
other contracts and exchanges.
The new legislation also allows US futures exchanges to keep day-to-day
margin-setting authority for stock index futures, with the CFTC and the US
Federal Reserve gaining powers to determine margins in emergency situations.
The reauthorisation debates have allowed Congress to impose tighter trade
practice rules on the big US futures exchanges. The new bill directs the
CFTC to require closer trade-tracking to detect and deter trading floor
abuses. It increases monetary penalties for CFTC rule violations, and it
requires futures exchanges to distribute records of its disciplinary actions
against members more broadly.
It also contains provisions against insider trading and 'dual' trading, and
prohibits floor brokers from engaging in the potentially abusive practice of
executing customer orders with their own business partners.

FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ball takes Smith Barney post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Ball, the former Prudential-Bache chairman, returned to Wall
Street yesterday after a long absence when he was appointed to a top post at
broking house Smith Barney, Harris Upham.
Mr Ball, 53, is joining the firm's executive committee and board of
directors. He will be filling a newly-created post of senior executive
vice-president with responsibility for developing the marketing strategy for
Smith Barney's high net-worth individual investor services, a cornerstone of
the broking house's business.
The position is likely to have been created to exploit Mr Ball's reputation
as an effective salesman and leader of retail brokers, built up during
almost 30 years working first at E. F Hutton, and then at Pru-Bache.
Mr Ball's appointment at Smith Barney, part of the diversified financial
conglomerate Primerica, comes more than a year and a half after his troubled
and controversial nine-year reign at Pru-Bache came to an abrupt end with
his resignation in February 1991.
During his tenure at Pru-Bache (now renamed Prudential Securities), the
securities house ran up heavy losses as the ambitious chairman tried to turn
the company into one of Wall Street's most powerful firms.
Mr Ball's attempt to build a major presence in investment banking, his
luring of Wall Street professionals from rival firms with large pay packets,
and the aggressive selling to investors of limited property partnerships,
proved particularly costly.
Today, Prudential Insurance, the parent company of Pru Securities, still
faces scores of lawsuits from angry investors who lost millions of dollars
on limited partnerships sold by the broking house in the 1980s.
After his departure from Pru-Bache, Mr Ball worked as a consultant to an
investment management firm and as chairman of a small finance house.
CS First Boston (Japan) plans to strengthen its yen fixed-income sales and
trading department, including the hiring of more staff.
The securities firm wants to increase sales to institutional and regional
investors in Japan, as well as foreign investors. To achieve this, the firm
intends to improve its research efforts and hire more traders in Tokyo.
Currently there are 35 people working in the firm's yen fixed-income
department in Tokyo.

GENERAL Motors, the struggling US vehicle-maker which has suffered two
strikes at parts plants over the past five weeks, is threatened with a
stoppage at an electrical plant in Anderson, Indiana.
The United Auto Workers union yesterday issued a letter authorising a strike
at Inland Fisher Guide if a dispute could not be resolved in the next five
business days.
A stoppage by Inland Fisher's 3,400 hourly-paid workers could seriously
disrupt GM production.
The plant supplies tail lights, parking lights and other exterior lighting
for most of the group's North American cars.
Although the various strikes have particular local causes, they are also
seen by analysts as a warning shots to GM by the UAW over job losses.

FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa strengthens its old
Chinese ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German flag-carrier, is attempting to cash in on China's
developing aviation boom by strengthening its presence as the largest
European airline serving the Chinese market.
Even though Lufthansa is in the throes of sweeping restructuring in Germany
to reduce its losses, it is continuing to grow in China with a series of
investments.
These range from new direct non-stop flights from Frankfurt, a joint hotel
and property venture in Beijing, and the expansion of a big aircraft
maintenance and engineering venture with Air China.
'Our investment strategy could have seemed somewhat risky and exaggerated
two or three years ago,' said Mr Werner Hupe, general manager of Beijing's
Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Corporation (Ameco), the biggest
western aircraft overhaul and maintenance centre in China, 40 per cent owned
by Lufthansa and 60 per cent controlled by Air China. 'But it now looks it
was the right thing to do,' he added.
Unlike other western airlines, Lufthansa decided not to reduce its air
services to China after the Tiananmen Square riots in June 1989. It also
went ahead with ambitious investment plans to build, with Chinese, German
and South Korean partners, a DM495m (Dollars 351m) hotel and property
complex in the Chinese capital, and form the Ameco aircraft maintenance
venture.
'We always felt the market potential was huge when you consider that China
has a population of 1.1bn people,' Mr Hupe explained. 'Right now, China is
the only market where you can sell aircraft.'
Domestic air traffic in China has been growing by about 28 to 30 per cent
this year over last year. China also recently indicated that it planned to
restructure its airline industry and partially open state-owned carriers and
airports to foreign investment.
The proposal would see the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)
spin off the country's six largest airlines into shareholding enterprises
with the possibility of foreign carriers acquiring minority stakes.
Lufthansa, together with Singapore Airlines, British Airways and
Hong-Kong-based Cathay Pacific have already expressed interest in either
taking a stake in a Chinese carrier or offering these carriers their
consultancy services.
The Chinese are placing a big emphasis on developing aviation services.
'Aviation is an important business card for China: if their aircraft operate
on time, look good and are technically sound, they will become an important
shop window for the country,' Mr Hupe said.
The Lufthansa executive also stressed the importance of building up
long-term relations with the Chinese. One reason for Lufthansa's strong
position in China was the German airline's historical links with the
country, he explained.
These links go back to the 1930s when the German carrier set up an airline
called Euroasia in partnership with the Chinese government.
It started by providing mail services from Shanghai to inner Mongolia and
Europe, but subsequently developed into an airline operating an internal
Chinese network which also served Hanoi and Hong Kong.
Although the venture ended in 1940, Lufthansa believes the experience helped
Lufthansa rebuild a strong presence in China.
The airline is to increase at the end of this month its non-stop weekly
flights from Frankfurt to Beijing to four in the face of increasing
competition from other European airlines.
Tomorrow, it will also be opening the new Beijing Lufthansa Centre, the DM
495m project which includes a luxury hotel run by its Kapinski hotel
subsidiary, Beijing's biggest department store, as well as a business centre
and residential flats.
Lufthansa originally planned to develop eight similar property developments
around the world. The Chinese venture, however, was the only one to survive
the airline's recent strategic retrenchment in the face of growing losses
caused by the decline in the world airline business.
The German airline is also expanding its joint venture Ameco maintenance
facility, which employs about 4,000 people, with the construction of a new
hangar for the maintenance of Boeing 747 jumbo jets.
The joint venture is the largest commercial aircraft overhaul and
maintenance base in China for western jets.
Mr Hupe expects Ameco's workload to continue to grow by about 10 to 12 per
cent a year as China increasingly turns to western aircraft powered by
western engines.
Although doing business in China will remain difficult and risky, the
Lufthansa executive with seven years experience of the Chinese aviation
industry said patience was likely to pay off in the long term.

FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: That sinking feeling in market
flotations Down Under - Kevin Brown reports on the jitters now forcing the
abandonment of some equity and rights issues in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S financial community is becoming increasingly jittery about the
prospects for forthcoming equity issues in the wake of a falling stock
market and a series of controversial flotations and rights offers.
The uncertainty was brought to a head last week by the abandonment of a
ADollars 2bn (Dollars 1.4bn) flotation of the Woolworths retailing chain,
owned by Industrial Equity (IEL), a subsidiary of the collapsed Adsteam
group.
The board of IEL reluctantly abandoned the flotation after being told by the
lead underwriters that there was no prospect of raising more than about
ADollars 1.7bn in the current state of the market.
IEL is not alone in having failed to bring an offering to the market in
recent weeks. Brokers say Wilson Neill of New Zealand also dropped plans to
float its Tasmanian brewery operations after being advised the issue would
flop.
Even Foster's Brewing Group, the world's fourth-largest brewer, has problems
with its ADollars 1bn rights issue. The ADollars 1.10-a-share issue appeared
to be deeply discounted when it was announced three weeks ago, but looks
much less attractive now that Foster's shares have slipped to ADollars 1.16.
The main reason for the uncertainty is the continuing weakness of the
Australian share market, with the All Ordinaries Index at 1,455.4 last
night, down 13.6 per cent from its peak of 1,684.5 in May.
The weakness reflects Australia's slower-than-expected recovery from
recession, combined with uncertainty about the timing and outcome of a
forthcoming federal election, and a reduction in demand from overseas
buyers.
But confidence has been further undermined by disappointment over several
recent equity issues, notably the ADollars 1.2bn flotation of the Government
Insurance Office (GIO) of New South Wales.
The GIO flotation, which was heavily promoted by the state government,
closed ADollars 1bn oversubscribed following unprecedented demand from small
investors, who took up 75 per cent of the shares.
After opening at a small premium, GIO shares have traded at a discount to
the ADollars 2.40 issue price, in spite of the release of improved trading
results. Many investors were also burnt by the weak aftermarket for the
ADollars 475m flotation of Australian Consolidated Press, the magazine arm
of Mr Kerry Packer's privately-owned media group.
But the greatest contributor to the uncertainty was the failure of a
ADollars 1.2bn rights issue by Westpac Banking Corporation, which was 72 per
cent under-subscribed, leaving about 17 per cent of issued shares in the
hands of the underwriters and sub-underwriters.
The turmoil caused by the Westpac debacle has sufficiently worried the
Australian Stock Exchange to prompt a check into the financial health of
brokers who participated in the sub-underwriting.
It has also raised questions about the willingness of corporate investors to
participate in future equity raisings. For example, Pioneer International,
the building products group, says it acquired 12m Westpac shares at the
issue price of ADollars 3, valued in its books at ADollars 36m, but worth
only ADollars 33.2m at last night's closing price of ADollars 2.77.
Pioneer has not ruled out participating in future underwritings, but says
the size of its exposure to Westpac was a 'one-off'.
So far, Pioneer is the only corporate casualty of the Westpac issue to come
clean about its exposure, but brokers say there is no doubt that many others
were tempted.
'The Westpac net spread well beyond the traditional underwriters into the
more adventurous industrial companies, and it is likely that many of those
will not want to participate in equity raisings again,' says Mr David Arch,
a director of the investment banking division of Schroders Australia.
'I think a number of flotations will be put on ice. Smaller flotations will
probably still go ahead because people will not be so worried about those,
but the ones where there is a large volume of stock coming on to the market
are going to be very hard to underwrite,' he says.
Mr Ralph Willis, the federal finance minister, appeared to concur with this
view yesterday when he suggested that the the flotation of Qantas, the
government-owned airline, might be delayed beyond the earlier target of
March 1993.
There must also be a question mark over other mooted flotations, including
Ansett, a domestic airline owned by TNT and News Corporation; David Jones,
another Adsteam retailing subsidiary; the Rural and Industries Bank, owned
by the Western Australia state government; the Channel Seven television
network, formerly owned by Mr Christopher Skase's Qintex group; and various
businesses owned by the governments of New South Wales and Victoria.
In addition, cash-hungry companies, such as the transport group TNT, long
rumoured to be considering a ADollars 500m rights issue, may have to find
other means of raising capital, such as equity issues in overseas markets.
However, not all observers are convinced that there is a rational basis for
the uncertainty in Australia. Mr Bruce Rolph, head of research at Barings,
says the widespread uneasiness is largely a reflection of the weakness of
the stock market, which he forecasts will recover by up to 25 per cent in
the next 12 months.
Mr Rolph argues that Westpac, Foster's and Adsteam should all be treated as
special cases: Westpac because of its poor public image; Foster's and
Adsteam because of their well-known former association with the failed
entrepreneurs Mr John Elliott and Mr John Spalvins.
But even the bullish Mr Rolph thinks the next large issue will need special
treatment. 'It will have to be deeply discounted because the market is quite
sceptical at the moment and the institutions are going to have to be very
confident that they will not be left holding undervalued stock,' he says.

THREE senior executives who played a leading role in Magna International's

But Magna, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, says it had signed
consulting contracts with all three.
The company said its focus was shifting to 'operational matters'.
Mr David Copeland, Mr James Nicol and Mr Werner Czernohorsky were
respectively chief financial officer, vice-president corporate development
and chief administrative officer. All three sat on a five-man executive
management committee set up in 1990 when Magna faced bankruptcy with growing
debt and sliding profits due to the recession.
Now Magna says it has drastically reduced debt and will resume 'disciplined
growth'. For the year ended July 31, profit was CDollars 98m (USDollars 79m)
on sales of CDollars 2.4bn.

HEWLETT-Packard of the US has formed a new worldwide business unit focused
upon developing and marketing information technology products for the
telecommunications industry.
Formation of the new organisation reflects the group's increased commitment
to the telecommunications market, the company said.
'The new business unit's mission is to build, on top of HP's broad computer
foundation, advanced telecommunications solutions,' said Mr Willem
Roelandts, an HP vice-president and general manager of the Computer Systems
Organisation.
'Hewlett-Packard will boost its contribution to the telecommunications
industry by introducing more focused products and services as well as
developing strategic alliances to better meet the needs of worldwide
customers,' he said.
The telecommunications industry spent Dollars 14bn on information technology
products and services worldwide last year and the market is expected to
expand to approximately Dollars 26bn by 1996, HP said.
The new business unit consists of three product operations, each having
worldwide product responsibilities and three geographically dispersed
business-development teams in Singapore, France and the US.
These groups will develop and market products for advanced networks,
telecommunications network management and customer network management.
HP is already one of the top suppliers of computer products to the
telecommunications industry.
It aims to expand its share of the market by developing products that will
'enable faster integration of operation support systems, business support
systems and telecommunications networks,' said Mr Lewis Platt, an HP
executive vice-president.
Pyramid Technology, which designs and makes high-performance open systems
servers, has unveiled a restructuring that will result in a charge of
between Dollars 22m and Dollars 24m in the fourth quarter ended September
30, Reuter reports from San Jose, California.
The company said it expected to report a 'substantial loss' for the fourth
quarter. Pyramid said it expects revenues for the quarter of Dollars 51m, up
from Dollars 48.6m in the third quarter ended June 30.

FUJITSU, the Japanese computer company, yesterday confirmed its capital
spending would be below forecast levels, while NEC, the electronics company,
may report consolidated net losses of more than Y10bn (Dollars 83m) for the
first half.
The two companies, and the entire Japanese electronics industry, are under
pressure because of a fall in capital spending at home and international
weakness in the computer and semiconductor markets. NEC is also suffering in
Japan's overcrowded consumer electronics market.
Fujitsu said it would reduce capital spending from a planned Y140bn to
Y110bn this year, while research and development spending would be about 8.5
per cent below the original plan. It is also transferring systems engineers
to the sales department in an attempt to bolster profits.
The company has forecast net consolidated losses of about Y20bn for the
first half to end-September, although it hopes an emergency economic package
recently announced by the Japanese government will stimulate sales in the
second half.
Meanwhile, NEC said that a Japanese newspaper report that it would incur
consolidated losses of more than Y10bn was not necessarily wrong, although
the company has not completed its calculation of first-half earnings.
Heavy discounting of computer and consumer electronic products in the
domestic market has hurt the company, while the recent appreciation of the
yen is likely to harm international profitability.
As with other semiconductor-makers, NEC is counting on an upturn in the US
market to lift demand and prices, which have fallen sharply over the past
two years.

FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Qantas advances 209% on eve of
privatisation

<TEXT>
QANTAS, the government-owned Australian airline, yesterday reported a 209
per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 137m (Dollars 98.7m) for the
year to the end of June, marking a solid recovery from its earlier financial
problems.
Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister, said the result understated the
underlying financial strength of Qantas, which the government wants to
privatise early next year.
The recovery in the airline's position was underlined by an improvement in
pre-tax operating profit from ADollars 68.9m to ADollars 322m. Revenue
increased from ADollars 3.8bn to ADollars 4bn.
Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman, said the 'very encouraging' result was
achieved 'in a highly competitive environment significantly affected by
depressed economic conditions and heavy price discounting in major markets.'
Mr Dix said the result should be seen against a background of world aviation
losses of ADollars 5.5bn in 1991, when several airlines had gone out of
business and only a handful had made a profit.
The improvement was largely due to improved productivity following
restructuring, and a ADollars 130m reduction in fuel costs following the end
of the Gulf war.
However, Mr Dix said the immediate outlook for the industry was uncertain
because of 'destructive competition' coupled with continuing world
recession, which would limit airline growth.
He said there was nothing to suggest that the industry outlook for the
current year was any better than in 1991-92, especially since many large
airlines had already reported reduced interim profits.
In parliament, Mr Willis said preparations for the sale of 49 per cent of
the airline to international carriers were proceeding. The government hopes
to receive binding offers from British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Air
New Zealand by the end of next month.
However, Mr Willis confirmed earlier indications that the flotation of the
remaining 51 per cent of the airline might not take place in March, as
planned, because of weakness in the Australian share market.
Qantas last month completed a ADollars 400m takeover of Australian Airlines,
the government-owned domestic airline, in the first phase of the
government's airline privatisation programme.

<TEXT>
CITICORP, the leading US bank, yesterday disclosed it could no longer make
acquisitions or add to its assets without the approval of federal banking
regulators. The bank has seen its share price drop by 5 per cent this week
in the wake of reduced profit forecasts and the surprise resignation of its
president.
The restrictions are part of a memorandum of understanding with the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Reserve that the bank
was forced to sign last February, but which was revealed only in August.
The memorandum provided for closer oversight by regulators, especially of
Citicorp's internal operating and capital plans. The bank has been selling
assets and cutting costs in order to improve its capital-to-assets ratio.
The additional constraint on making acquisitions was disclosed yesterday by
Citicorp in a securities filing made in connection with a Dollars 650m offer
of preferred stock. Mr John Morris, Citicorp's spokesman, said he did not
regard the latest disclosure as 'substantive'.
Morgan Stanley, the investment bank leading the preferred stock offer, will
today begin making a presentation to investors in New York.
Wall Street analysts say the stock offer could be affected by market
confusion about the reasons behind the abrupt departure on Monday of Mr
Richard Braddock, the Citicorp president, who was a close colleague of Mr
John Reed, the bank's chairman. The bank has said that Mr Braddock chose to
resign.
Citicorp also said in its filing that its third-quarter earnings would be in
the range of Dollars 80m to Dollars 100m, or less than half the level
previously anticipated by most analysts.
The bank said consumer loan write-offs would remain high at about Dollars
870m, while there would also be about Dollars 65m of pre-tax charges related
to the bank's restructuring programme.
Yesterday, on Wall Street, the bank's share price declined by Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 14 5/8 , having already fallen by Dollars  3/4 on Tuesday.

ANSETT Transport Industries, the aviation group owned jointly owned by TNT
and News Corporation, may be floated 'at some stage in the future,' TNT said
yesterday.
Mr David Mortimer, who last week replaced Sir Peter Abeles as TNT managing
director, said that flotation was a long-term option for Ansett, which lost
ADollars 132m in the year to June.
However, he said Ansett would first have to demonstrate an improved earnings
record. Ansett would reduce debt by disposing of non-core activities such as
its Hayman Island tourist resort.
News Corporation has said it has long-term plans to sell its 50 per cent
stakes in Ansett and Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services an aircraft leasing
associate.
Mr Mortimer said AWAS would have to be recapitalised, probably in the next
three years, to bolster its competitive position.

CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third-largest bank, said its revenue in the
first nine months was ahead of last year's level, and it expected net
profits for the year to be comparable with last year's record SFr848m
(Dollars 689.4m).
Although the slack demand for credit was hurting, commission income was
showing a marked rise. 'Swaps and derivative financial instruments again
account for a significant part of the increase in trading revenue,' said Mr
Robert Jeker, chief executive.
Mr Jeker warned that provisions for bad debts could be higher than last
year's SFr1.1bn because of the persistent weakness of the world economy, but
he said that Credit Suisse, the main subsidiary of CS Holding, was in 'a
very good position' with a capital ratio of 9.8 per cent under the Basle
norms.
He also quashed occasional speculation in Switzerland that the bank might
abandon the retail sector in its home country.
Mr Jeker said it was 'essential to maintain our strong position in the
retail banking sector'.

<TEXT>
SPIE-BATIGNOLLES, one of France's largest construction companies which fell
into the red last year, expects to reduce its losses significantly this year
after making a lower than expected deficit in the first half.
The company, a subsidiary of the Schneider electrical engineering group,
managed to contain its interim loss to FFr91.2m, (Dollars 18.8m) against
FFr150.5m in the first six months of last year.
Spie attributed the improvement to a reduction in costs following the
restructuring of its French construction interests.
The company said yesterday that it expected its loss in the second half to
be roughly in line with that of the first.
It also forecast a slight fall in turnover for the full year from FFr22.5bn
in 1991 to around FF21bn in 1992, reflecting its withdrawal from
unprofitable areas of activity.
Last year, Spie crashed from profits of FFr251m in 1991 into a loss of
FFr950m.
This was attributed to the general slowdown in France's construction
industry and losses on the company's work on the Channel Tunnel project.

TENGELMANN, the German department store group, and other investors yesterday
received the go-ahead to acquire 147 retail outlets in Budapest.
The Hungarian government accepted offers of Ft4bn (Dollars 52m) with
additional investment commitments of up to Ft1bn, representing the biggest
single Hungarian retail privatisation to date.
Tengelmann emerged as the main winner in the auction, taking 24 of the
larger shops in return for a total investment of about Ft1.5bn.
Louis Delhaize Group, the Belgian retailing company, won 10 outlets.
Tengelmann and Delhaize already own Hungarian retailing operations and the
latest acquisitions will remove a major constraint on their planned
expansion.
The German group, with its strong emphasis on expansion of department and
discount stores in eastern Europe, is the major shareholder in Skala Co-op,
the Hungarian department store chain.
Delhaize Profi-Duna discount retailing and Duna Fuszert wholesaling
businesses helped Hungary contribute 6.4 per cent of group sales in 1991.
Discount retailing has proved attractive in Hungary, as declining real
incomes have led consumers to economise.
Yesterday's transaction is unusual in that the State Property Agency, the
privatisation authority, offered the 147 outlets for sale singly although
they were grouped until now in 10 state-owned 'Kozert' groups.
Generally, the SPA has found it less time-consuming to sell state companies
intact even if the proceeds are lower.
Another 183 Kozert stores remain to be sold; these, however, are generally
smaller and will attract less international interest.

FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford to cut production at
Cologne factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD OF Europe is cutting production at its car assembly plant in Cologne,
Germany, in response to falling sales in western Europe and excessive
stocks.
It is stopping production of the top-of-the-range Scorpio/Granada for three
weeks beginning October 19 and is stopping output of its Fiesta small car
for one week from the same date.
The production cuts in Germany, the first for many years, are in addition to
similar moves already announced at other Ford plants in Europe. Ford's two
British car plants at Dagenham and Halewood, as well those at Genk, Belgium
and Valencia, Spain will all go over to short-time working this month.
Ford warned last month that its European operations would suffer a loss for
the full year after struggling back into profit in the first half of 1992
from last year's record loss.
The German production cuts mean that Ford will lose output of around 6,000
Fiestas and slightly more than 3,000 Scorpios/Granadas.
Around 5,500 hourly-paid German workers will be affected by the short-time
working on the Fiesta and Scorpio assembly lines. Of those, some 1,500 will
be affected by the three-week lay-off. The workers will receive around 90
per cent of their net pay when the production is stopped.
Cut-backs elsewhere in Europe this month are stopping Fiesta production in
Spain for five days - with the loss of around 7,000 cars - while the Sierra
assembly line in Belgium has been reduced from two shifts to a single shift
and only four-day working for two weeks.
In the UK, Ford has told trade unions that it has 'half an assembly plant
too much capacity'.
It is shedding 1,550 jobs in the UK and is cutting around 20 per cent of its
capacity at the Dagenham and Halewood plants.

SOCIETE Generale yesterday lightened the gloomy mood of the French banking
sector by announcing an 8 per cent increase in interim profits to FFr1.98bn
(Dollars 410m) for the first half of 1992 from FFr1.83bn in the same period
last year.
The robust increase in profits from Societe Generale bucks the trend among
France's big banks, which have been badly affected by the competitive state
of the domestic banking market and by the need to make steep increases in
provisions on their property holdings and industrial investments.
Credit Lyonnais last month disclosed that it had barely broken even in the
first half of the year.
Banque Indosuez, the prominent investment banking subsidiary of the Suez
industrial group, reported a similarly steep fall in profits because of a
hefty increase in its provisions.
Paribas, another force in French investment banking, only avoided a dramatic
decline in its interim profits because of the proceeds of its disposal
programme.
Paribas was yesterday clouded by its involvement with Ciments Francais, the
troubled construction company now embroiled in a controversy over
previously-undisclosed losses on off-balance sheet financial dealings.
By contrast, Societe Generale, one of France's largest private-sector banks,
managed to increase its profits at the operating level and to avoid a steep
increase in provisions on its property and industrial interests.
Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said that Societe Generale had pursued a 'prudent
provisions policy' in recent years.
As a result, he said, it was able to limit the increase in first-half
writedowns to 16.5 per cent, taking it to FFr3.05bn
Societe Generale saw its net banking income increase by 5.5 per cent to
FFr18.6bn during the first six months of the year.
Its gross operating profits rose by 4.5 per cent to FFr5.75bn in the same
period.
Mr Vienot said the bank planned to 'maintain the strategy of diversifying
into different areas of revenue' in the future. However he refused to make a
profit forecast for the full financial year.
Societe Generale, like other French banks, has been trying to counter the
impact of competition by cutting costs. It announced a radical
rationalisation programme for its French retail banking network, which will
involve shedding 1,300 of its 23,000 staff within three years.

Posco chief's resignation
</HEADLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PARK Tae-joon, chairman of South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Company
(Posco), appeared determined yesterday to quit the world's third-largest
steelmaker despite symbolic protests among the company's managers and
workers.
Mr Park's resignation, which took the company by surprise on Monday, came a
week before Posco shares are to be offered to foreign investors for the
first time. His departure comes amid signs of conflict between Mr Park and
other leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP).
In an attempt to persuade Mr Park to reconsider his decision, the company's
48 directors threatened to resign, 141 department managers signed an appeal
for him to stay on, and more than 3,000 Posco workers demonstrated at the
company's steel complexes in Pohang and Kwangyang.
Mr Park left Seoul, where he was attending a DLP meeting of the as the
party's co-chairman, to travel to Pohang to explain his decision to the
company's labour force.
The protests reflect fears over Posco's future after Mr Park leaves, as well
as his revered status within the company he created 25 years ago on the
Korean government's orders. Mr Park provided extensive social welfare
benefits to his workers, which made him popular.
Analysts said Mr Park's resignation would probably not immediately effect
Posco's prospects since it has one of the best managements in South Korea.
But they expressed concern about the long-term implications.
'Posco is known for its exceptionally loyal and cohesive management, which
is largely due to Mr Park's personal dedication to the company. The danger
is that esprit de corps could disappear along with Mr Park, especially if
the government eventually appoints an outsider to run the company,' said one
Korean securities analyst.
Posco, which is 35 per cent owned by the Korean government, has benefited
from Mr Park's close ties with the political leadership. Mr Park said he
timed his resignation to coincide with the completion of final phase of the
expansion of Posco's production facilities.
However, Mr Park may have fallen victim to the growing dissension within the
DLP as the presidential election approaches in December.
Mr Park has indicated he is opposed to the DLP presidential candidate, Mr
Kim Young-sam. Mr Park made an abortive bid for the DLP presidential
nomination earlier this year. There is speculation that Mr Park may leave
the DLP to support another presidential candidate or stand himself.
Possible successors to Mr Park include Mr Hwang Kyung-ro, vice-chairman; Mr
Jung Myung-sik, president; and Mr Park Tuk-pyo, vice-president for strategic
planning.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Recession fails to halt advance at Halstead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES HALSTEAD, the Manchester-based floor-coverings, weatherproof clothing
and trailers group, continued to defy the recession by posting a 5 per cent
improvement in full year pre-tax profits and by lifting its total dividend
by 6.7 per cent.
Pre-tax profits in the year to June 30 grew from Pounds 7.65m to Pounds
8.04m despite 'extremely severe' trading conditions which resulted in only a
modest increase in turnover to Pounds 58.9m (Pounds 58.3m).
Earnings per share rose to 37.71p (36.12p) and a recommended final dividend
of 7.5p (7p) makes a 12p (11.25p) total.
An extraordinary provision of Pounds 2.93m covered the costs of closing the
loss-making Belstaff garment manufacturing operations.
Mr Stephen Knight, finance director, said it had been a year of solid
achievement and consolidation for Polyflor, the group's core sheet vinyl and
tile floor-covering business which accounts for more than two thirds of
group turnover.
The DIY carpet tile business also showed improvement and the Driza-Bone
Australian weatherproof clothing business, acquired three years ago, had a
successful year.
Conway Products managed to increase camping product sales in both the UK and
Holland, helped by a new budget-priced trailer-tent model. As expected, the
Belstaff clothing business was closed after its losses accelerated towards
the end of last year.
During the year the group spent more than Pounds 3m on capital investment,
mostly in the floor covering business.
Despite the heavy level of investment and the cost of the Belstaff closure,
the group's strong positive cash flow enabled it to further strengthen its
balance sheet and end the year with no net borrowings.
A 1-for-1 scrip issue is proposed in order to improve market liquidity for
its shares which closed yesterday up 21p at 481p.
COMMENT
Halstead is a good, solid and safe investment in uncertain economic times,
but is unlikely to continue to outperform the market so spectacularly when
recovery comes. Its core vinyl flooring business faces growing competition
and margins are likely to come under increasing pressure, so promised new
PVC sheet flooring products will be crucial. Higher raw material prices are
likely following sterling's recent plunge, and the overseas manufacturers of
the group's motorcycle accessories are pushing for higher prices. But
Halstead's growing export business should help offset these pressures.
Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 8.4m are likely this year, producing
earnings per share of around 38p. Halstead is trading on a prospective p/e
of 12.6 and is a hold.

SHARES IN the water sector fell yesterday on the news that Lyonnaise des
Eaux Dumez, the French water and construction company, had sold its 8.99 per
cent stake in Anglian Water for some Pounds 108m. Shares in Anglian itself
fell 13p to 417p.
Lyonnaise sold some 26.52m shares at 410p each to Cazenove and Warburgs.
They in turned placed the shares with institutions at 415p.
The group sold the shares to maintain a high level of liquidity, said Mrs
Christine Morin-Postel of Lyonnaise.
But it was not going to sell North-East Water, Essex Water and Suffolk Water
 -all of which it owns - since 'they are part of our core business.'
Lyonnaise sold its stakes in Wessex Water and Severn Trent in November 1990.
It had acquired the water company shares shortly after they were floated in
December, 1989.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Self-preservation instinct wins day -
Andrew Baxter on the victory of Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, head of Lancer Boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week's victory for Lancer Boss Group in a two-year planning battle with
environmentalists marks yet another coup for a man with a reputation as one
of Britain's most autocratic industrialists.
Critics describe Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman and co-founder of the
largest UK-owned lift truck producer, as irritable, intolerant, and
difficult to work with.
Sir Neville and his brother Mr Trevor Bowman-Shaw own 100 per cent of Boss,
which they built from scratch in 1958 to the world's ninth biggest lift
truck manufacturer. Sir Neville admits that 'people skills' are not his
strong point.
But he does claim 'a very strongly developed sense of self-preservation'.
And for Lancer Boss to survive and prosper in the increasingly competitive
world lift truck industry, Sir Neville realised that it needed to replace
its factories scattered across the Bedfordshire town of Leighton Buzzard
with a plant that could function effectively as a high-volume producer.
Sir Neville had made no secret of the alternative if the row over a 95-metre
encroachment into the green belt had brought defeat for Boss.
Difficult planning procedures are causing industrialists to relocate on the
Continent, he says, and Boss might well have followed suit.
But the Boss chairman has a knack of getting his message across, a useful
asset in a country where the manufacturing sector has had to fight
increasingly hard to be heard.
Along with many industrialists, Sir Neville has been looking to Mr Michael
Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, to achieve 'a better balance'
between industry and employment, and the environment. And whatever the
involvement of the Department of Trade and Industry, the need to safeguard
600 jobs, and perhaps create 500 more eventually, clearly weighed heavily
with Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary.
But, despite being a committed Tory, Sir Neville remains worried about
whether the Conservative philosophy of the early 1980s - that economic
growth prospects depended more on building the service economy rather than
manufacturing - has been laid to rest.
A fan of former prime minister Lady Thatcher, he acknowledges what is,
possibly, her blind spot: 'She's done so much good, but by God she was wrong
about manufacturing.' But the root of Britain's manufacturing decline goes
much deeper, he says, blaming the legacy of Victorian and Edwardian snobbery
about industry.
'There are still houses in this country where I'm asked what I do and the
questioners' nose is turned up at the thought of sitting next to an
industrialist, not a gynaecologist, a doctor, a banker or a broker. Now in
Germany, I'm treated like God Almighty in comparison.'
But Sir Neville also criticises 'socialist-minded teachers who preach about
the rat race and warn that if you don't do well you'll end up in a factory.
So you've got both ends attacking us, and it's quite wrong because we're the
wealth creators.'
It's a situation which, sadly, he cannot see changing quickly.
Much of the company's success boils down to Sir Neville's survival instinct,
coupled with what he calls 'an irritating ability to judge a commercial
design. Although I say it myself I'm quite a good innovator, not just in
designing trucks, but in systems and procedures.'
He admits that he could not be considered a 'people person . . . my worst
characteristic is that I can still rile, which is stupid and I regret it. I
am afraid of emotion and welfare, and therefore take difficult decisions
separately and easily, leaving these issues to personnel.'
He objects, however, to being called ruthless, which suggests malice rather
than objectivity, and strongly defends a policy which focuses on getting the
products right.
Sir Neville has had plenty of opportunity to practice his emotion-free
decision-making and to learn from mistakes made during the past 33 years,
which nearly ruined the company.
The front axle fell off the brothers' first machine the day after it was
delivered, but more than a decade of rapid growth followed.
Then things went badly wrong in 1974 after the company standardised on
engines from the then struggling Perkins group and began manufacturing at a
grant-aided factory in Peterlee, seriously overstretching a management team
based at Leighton Buzzard.
After three rounds of redundancies that virtually halved the workforce,
Lancer Boss was cash rich again by 1979, and Sir Neville began looking for
foreign acquisitions, realising the necessity for the company's long-term
survival of establishing a strong European presence and a broad product
range.
Several false starts in the early 1980s ended when the company snapped up
Munich-based Steinbock in 1983, followed by Barcelona-based SAM Fenwick in
1987 and a majority stake in Hyco of Milan last year.
Last month Boss bought Manualp, the largest materials handling equipment
distributor in central France. And this week HycoBoss, as the Italian
company is now called, unveiled three new container handlers.
The Steinbock acquisition has given Sir Neville his most revealing insights
about different attitudes to manufacturing and engineering skills in the UK
and Germany.
'I would say 45 is the oldest you would want to employ an Englishman because
they are poorly educated, and, even worse, badly trained vocationally,' he
says.
'A man lacking vocational knowledge will often commit himself, full of
enthusiasm, to a project, and then fail. In contrast, it is more difficult
to get the Germans, who are better educated, to accept a plan, but once they
do they know enough to achieve it.'
The difference might explain why Boss has historically suffered badly in the
UK from high staff turnover, especially among middle-aged managers.
But Sir Neville maintains that the company is now recruiting better and
improving training, and makes no apology for giving his managers a rough
ride: 'It's no use me, at the age of 62, being prepared to change, if some
30-year-old is beginning to think about his pension.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Austin Reed slips into red and cuts
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTIN REED, the upmarket clothing retailer, yesterday reported its
first-ever loss and a one-third cut in its interim dividend.
The pre-tax deficit of Pounds 430,000 for the 28 weeks to August 8 compared
with profits last time of Pounds 639,000.
Mr Chris Thomson, finance director, said: 'Clearly, in the face of such
difficult circumstances, it is only prudent to trim the interim dividend.'
The pay-out is being cut from 3p to 2p. Losses of 1p compared with earnings
of 1.5p
The company's shares fell 5p to 193p despite an improving stock market.
Mr Thomson said Reed was confident of reporting a profit for the full year
due to the seasonal nature of the business. Following disposals and
closures, Reed was more than ever weighted towards the second half, he said.
Turnover for the six months fell from Pounds 35.6m to Pounds 28.7m. Some
Pounds 5m of the decline was due to the sale at the end of last year of
Robertson, a Scottish knitwear company. A 10 per cent decline in exports
also hit sales.
The disposal accounted for about half of the 11 per cent sales decline in
the manufacturing division. Retail, which accounts for 75 per cent of
turnover, fell 3 per cent on a like-for-like basis.
Mr Thomson said that despite the sales decline, the company had managed to
maintain margins in both manufacturing and retail.
The company's flagship store on London's Regent Street increased sales by 3
per cent, partly due to a higher number of tourists. Regent Street accounts
for a fifth of the company's sales.
The south-east of England accounts for about 60 per cent of sales in the
company's 38 shops.
Mr Thomson said the company had strengthened its balance sheet, with debt as
a percentage of shareholders' funds down from 34 to 24 per cent. Net debt
had been cut through the Robertson disposal from Pounds 18m to Pounds 12.5m.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Burn Stewart meets flotation forecast with
rise to Pounds 10.34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURN STEWART Distillers, the Scotch whisky producer, increased pre-tax
profits from Pounds 8.23m to Pounds 10.34m for the year ended June 30. The
26 per cent advance matched the forecast made by the company when it came to
the market last November.
Its shares closed 8p higher yesterday at 129p, com-pared with the flotation
price of 140p.
Earnings per share of 13.2p, marginally higher than forecast because of a
lower than expected tax charge, were unchanged from 1991 because of the
greater number of shares in issue.
A final dividend of 3.33p will be paid.
In spite of difficult trading conditions, operating profits rose from Pounds
11.44m to Pounds 12.47m on turnover 10 per cent higher at Pounds 41.95m.
The company, which makes Black Prince whisky and supplies own-label brands
to multiple retailers such as Asda, increased the bottled-in-Scotland share
of its business.
Gross margins were maintained at last year's levels. Lower volume sales of
high-value aged whiskies and some softening of prices were offset by the
increased use of the company's stocks of lower cost whiskies.
Mr Bill Thornton, chairman, said that the development of the business would
con-tinue to focus on building sales of the bottled-in-Scotland brands.
New distribution arrangements were being introduced in a number of overseas
markets and additional marketing and sales staff had been recruited.
The recently-established Russian joint venture, Plodimex, was extending its
trading activities in wines and spirits in Russia and eastern Europe. 'It
has not yet made any material contribution to profits but we regard it as a
long-term growth opportunity,' Mr Thornton said.
Overall, trading since June had been satisfactory, he added. Prospects for
the rest of the year would depend on price levels, but they should be helped
by the sterling devaluation.
The company has used part of the flotation proceeds to reduce borrowings
from Pounds 28m to Pounds 12m. Gearing has fallen from well over 200 per
cent to 36 per cent, and interest charges, down from Pounds 3.21m to Pounds
2.13m, are covered 5.9 times.

changes hands

<TEXT>
RAMUS HOLDINGS, the USM-quoted distributor of ceramic tiles and kitchen
furniture, yesterday announced sharply increased pre-tax losses of Pounds
2.95m for the year to June 30 and a Pounds 3m cash injection giving control
to a specially created Jersey company.
Guoline Holdings, owned by Malaysian companies Hong Leong Industries and
Hume Industries (Malaysia), has agreed to subscribe for 6.5m new ordinary
shares at 50p each, giving it 57.5 per cent of the enlarged share capital.
The Takeover Panel has consented to waive conditions which would require
Guoline to make an offer for Ramus.
The company said that once the subscription was completed the entire board
would resign, with the exception of Mr Lionel Ramus, chairman, and Mr John
Ramus. Mr KC Wong would become joint managing director with Mr John Ramus.
The proceeds of the subscription will be used to provide additional working
capital and repay Pounds 1.5m of bank borrowings.
Ramus said yesterday that trading conditions had become severe in the second
half. Force One, distributor of kitchens and bathrooms acquired last
December, had produced a disappointing performance and as a result its
management had been replaced.
The pre-tax loss, which compared with a Pounds 360,000 deficit last time,
included Pounds 700,000 trading losses from Force One.
Sales were Pounds 52.9m (Pounds 49.3m). Losses per share jumped to 63.1p
(5.1p). There is no final dividend; last year 0.1p was paid.
Dealings in the company's shares were suspended on September 16. The
directors expect dealings to resume on Friday.

EXETER Preferred Capital Investment Trust, which came to the market in
January with an unusual structure to invest in the shares of split-capital
trusts, yesterday announced a change in investment policy.
A larger part of its portfolio will be invested in income shares, because
the gross redemption yields on zero dividend preference shares has fallen
from more than 11 per cent to about 10 per cent. Yields on income shares,
however, are as high as 20 per cent.
The prospectus estimate of 341p for the net asset value of the ordinary
shares at the end of the company's life in 2002 has been revised to 315p.
This is because the price of income shares has fallen on fears of higher
interest rates and reductions in dividends.
The trust has decided to purchase Pounds 15m of its zero debenture stock.

<TEXT>
ALLIED LEISURE, the nightclub and ten-pin bowling operator, yesterday
reported a 29 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.21m in the year
ended July as leisure spending continued to show no signs of recovering.
The company has yet to sell any of the loss making theme bars which it said
earlier this year it was writing off its books with an extraordinary charge
of Pounds 3.23m.
Since the company's most recent rights issue 18 months ago, the share price
has dropped from about 100p to 36p.
Pre-tax profits in the year to July fell from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.21m on
sales up 25 per cent at Pounds 27.42m.
Earnings per share fell from 12.2p to 5.26p but the group will pay a final
dividend of 3.25p, making a total for the year of 4.75p.
After Pounds 13m of capital expenditure on its Megabowl, including two new
sites at Preston and Dundee, net debt has risen to Pounds 14.3m.
As a result gearing has risen to 51 per cent from 24 per cent last year. Mr
Duncan Moss, finance director said the company aimed to maintain gearing
below 55 per cent.
Then group has made a Pounds 304,000 provision covering future costs
relating to the stand-alone theme bars which are to be sold and have been
written off in the accounts.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart at Pounds 6.7m sees gloomy
outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWDEN STUART, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company, said
yesterday it was assuming that there would be little improvement in the
economy before 1994.
Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman of the Glasgow-based group, said the recent
collapse of the government's economic policies had brought further
uncertainty into the deeply recessionary construction industry.
The six months to July 31 saw pre-tax profits fall by 16.5 per cent to
Pounds 6.73m (Pounds 8.06m) on turnover marginally down from Pounds 90.6m to
Pounds 89m.
Sir Matthew said these results were a 'first-class achievement,'
particularly in view of the drying up of work for the tower cranes division
.
These activities lost more than Pounds 500,000 in the first half, compared
with profits of Pounds 1.8m last year, but remained strongly cash
generative. In the last three years the number of tower cranes owned by the
group has declined from 180 to 80.
Sir Matthew said efforts were continuing to further reduce the tower crane
fleet and seek more work overseas, but it would be some time before the
division returned to reasonable profits.
Strong cash flow meant that at July 31 cash balances were between Pounds 7m
and Pounds 8m, in spite of spending almost Pounds 13m.
The group expects to spend less than Pounds 10m in the second half, but said
it might exceed that if offered good second-hand equipment at favourable
prices.
The remaining hire companies increased both turnover and profits, although
bad debt provision was doubled to Pounds 1.3m.
Sir Matthew said: 'Trading conditions remain very difficult as we approach
the winter months and it is obvious that many of our customers are being
heavily supported by their bankers and restricting capital expenditure.
Unfortunately the construction industry is seeing a serious shortfall in its
workload, which must act as more than a counter-balance to the improved
situation which could otherwise have been anticipated from a continuing
reduction in the amount of equipment available for hire.'
Earnings per share fell to 2.39p (2.96p), but the interim dividend was given
a nominal increase to 0.875p (0.865p).
COMMENT
Hewden Stuart is a class act - what a pity it has to operate in such a
bombed-out industry. Analysts are impressed by the group's ability to
generate cash and conservative depreciation policy, which led it to write
off Pounds 11.85m from operating profits of Pounds 18.28m. But things are
grim indeed when so staunch a supporter of the Tories as Sir Matthew refers
to government policy in such scathing terms. Forecast full-year profits of
Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 12m put the shares on a hefty prospective multiple of
about 19. Hewden Stuart will certainly benefit when the gloom eventually
lifts from construction, but buyers at this level will have to join the
management in taking a long-term view.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan, the food and drinks company, yesterday took the first
step in a plan to extend to continental Europe the refrigerated dough
business of Pillsbury, its US food subsidiary.
GrandMet is acquiring the German refrigerated dough business of Kraft
General Foods of the US. The business, which had sales last year of Pounds
12m, sells its products under the Knack &amp; Back brand and is market leader in
Germany.
The value of the deal was not disclosed, but GrandMet and KGF, a subsidiary
of the Philip Morris tobacco group, said it would have no material impact on
their shareholders' funds.
Mr Peter Thompson, joint chief operating officer of GrandMet's food
division, said the acquisition was an important step in the company's
strategy to build a European refrigerated dough business.
GrandMet is understood to be planning to enter other continental European
markets, possibly through further acquisitions.
Pillsbury is the largest producer of frozen dough in the US, with annual
sales of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m).
GrandMet launched the product a year ago in Britain, where it is said to
have more than 70 per cent of a small but growing market.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Concern over Gateway as Isosceles
refinances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of Isosceles, the buy-out vehicle for the Gateway food
retailing group, will meet today to approve the company's refinancing
agreement tied up with its banks in August.
Holders of 95 per cent of the shares have already undertaken to vote in
favour of the resolutions.
However, there are concerns that even after this refinancing, the second
since the Pounds 2.1bn bid for Gateway was completed in 1989, goes through,
the group's finances may require further restructuring.
The group's problems stem from its inability to make asset sales to reduce
the debt, which stood at Pounds 1.26bn at the April 25 financial year end,
and from a marked worsening of trading conditions since the original
buy-out.
Isosceles is still trying to sell its Herman's Sporting Goods chain of shops
in the US and Wellworth food retailing business in Northern Ireland.
Negotiations are believed to be at an advanced stage for the sale of
Wellworth, expected to recoup more than Pounds 125m.
The company maintains that trading, while tough, is no worse than
anticipated when talks with bankers began in the spring, and that its new
stores - such as Food Giant, Somerfield and SoLo - are showing sales
increases.
The latest refinancing involves deferral of Pounds 48m of interest on the
mezzanine debt, new facilities of Pounds 64m once the Pounds 48m limit has
been reached, conversion of preference shares into ordinary shares and the
issue to mezzanine lenders of options to buy up to 20 per cent of the
group's ordinary shares at 1p each.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fags increases stake in Chilean copper mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTOFAGASTA Holdings, which has interests in mining, banking, transportation
and water supply in Chile, has increased its stake in the Lince copper mine
and high technology treatment plant in Chile.
Antofagasta paid Outokumpu Copper Resources Dollars 36m (Pounds 20.2m) cash
for a further 39.985 per cent stake in Lince, which increases the group's
holding in the open-pit mine and its solvent-extraction electro-winning
(SX-EW) treatment plant to 99.985 per cent.
SX-EW technology is an increasingly popular low-cost and highly efficient
alternative to the traditional smelting process. The purchase of the Lince
stake will give Antofagasta full control of the management of the mine and
the plant, and enable it to use the treatment plant for processing other
ores which it owns.
The Lince mine is in the Antofagasta II region of Chile and has defined
reserves of 16m tonnes of oxide copper with an average grade of 1.6 per
cent.
The development of the mine and construction of the treatment plant was com-
pleted at the end of 1991 and the first trial copper cathodes were produced
in January.
During the 1992 second half production will reach a rate of 20,000 tonnes of
copper cathodes per year. At the end of last year Lince had net assets of
Dollars 63.2m.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Decline in earnings from sports goods cuts
Grampian Holdings to Pounds 2.45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COLLAPSE in first-half earnings from sports goods reduced Grampian
Holdings' profit before tax and exceptional items by 40 per cent.
The Scottish mini-conglomerate's share price, which stood at 207p less than
a year ago, fell 16p to a five-year low of 90p yesterday.
Pre-tax profit declined from Pounds 4.12m to Pounds 2.45m before an
exceptional profit of Pounds 8.34m on the Pounds 16.3m sale of Mitre to
Genesco, of the US. Turnover slipped to Pounds 66.7m (Pounds 68.3m).
In the continuing businesses, pre-tax profit was 28 per cent down at Pounds
2.44m (Pounds 3.37m) on sales of Pounds 63.6m (Pounds 60.7m). Mitre's
contribution was only Pounds 10,000 compared with Pounds 749,000.
Sports goods accounted for the main decline in ongoing activities, making
only Pounds 160,000 profit compared with Pounds 1.1m - although that was
helped by Pounds 400,000 of plant and machinery sales.
Profits roughly halved in golf gear and at Patrick, the French supplier of
football boots. Mr David McGibbon, finance director, said: 'Margins came
under pressure as retailers destocked and looked for deals.'
Animal pharmaceuticals, the largest division, increased sales to Pounds
22.5m (Pounds 20.3m) with the help of an acquisition. But pre-tax profit was
flat at Pounds 3.06m (Pounds 3.03m).
Mr Bill Hughes, chairman, said volumes had fallen in some of Grampian's
niche agricultural markets, such as sheep dip. Demand from poultry and fish
producers had been weakened by imports. The offseting factor was an improved
performance in Australia.
Retailing, namely tourist mill shops, repeated its seasonal loss of Pounds
1.2m. Transport saw pre-tax profit inch ahead to Pounds 942,000 (Pounds
922,000).
Mr Hughes said that pharmaceuticals and sports goods had remained under
pressure in the third quarter and the tipper side of transport had also
weakened. Retailing had enjoyed a 12.4 per cent sales increase.
Interest costs rose to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 2.1m) and year-end debt was
expected to be Pounds 19m (Pounds 21m) after the first Pounds 12m of the
Mitre payment and a Pounds 7m acquisition.
Earnings per share fell to 2.61p (4.34p) before exceptionals and rose to
14.7p afterwards. The interim dividend is held at 1.7p.
COMMENT
Grampian triggered last year's bidding scramble for Macarthy, owner of the
Savory &amp; Moore retail chain which eventually fell to Lloyds Chemists. In the
wake of that ambitious attempt at a hostile bid, the headache has proved
painful. In the continuing businesses, the former star performer,
pharmaceuticals, is facing rationalisation and redundancy costs. Sports
goods has been hit by recession and conditions for transport are worsening.
In the accounts, questions have been raised about profits from disposals,
capitalisation of R and D costs and the underlying trading performance of
what has been an acquisitive company. The share price ought to find a floor
at its present yield of 8.1 per cent and prospective p/e of 10.5, on an
Pounds 8m pre-tax profit forecast. At this level it begins to present a
buying opportunity. But with another tough year in prospect, the potential
for recovery is long term.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Renishaw limits fall to 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENISHAW, the maker of precision measuring probes and inspection equipment,
suffered an 18 per cent decline in annual profits due to a sharp fall in
sales to its main machine tools markets.
The group managed to limit the impact of the 40 per cent fall in the machine
tools market, most of which is now in Japan, by introducing new products,
increasing market share and cutting manufacturing costs.
Pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 fell from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds
9.09m on sales of Pounds 44.05m (Pounds 45.7m). Earnings per share fell from
16.1p to 13.1p and the recommended final dividend of 4p, makes 6.5p for the
year (6p).
Recession in many markets shaved net margins from 18 per cent to 15 per
cent. But this hid gross margins that remained resilient before absorbing
some input price rises and increased marketing costs.
Net cash rose from Pounds 20.23m to Pounds 21.49m.
Mr David McMurtry, chairman and chief executive, said there was a flicker of
hope for economic recovery in the US, but elsewhere there was not much sign
of a recovery.
The continuing decline in the British machine tools and co-ordinate
measuring machine markets meant that sales had halved to about 5 per cent of
total group turnover.
With the majority of sales outside the UK and many input costs denominated
in sterling, Renishaw is likely to gain some benefit from devaluation of the
pound.
COMMENT
To all but maintain sales when its crucial Japanese machine tools market has
collapsed is a tribute to Renishaw's new product development and fleet of
foot. As well as switching its sales effort from original equipment
manufacturers to end users, the company has also started to use its own
tools to increase its manufacturing efficiency and is spending more R&amp;D on
its own product manufacturing techniques. Renishaw is one of the few
genuinely innovative British companies and has as a result had to bear very
little pressure on gross margins. But it is also a cyclical stock, dependent
on recovery in the world capital goods markets. With profits forecast at
Pounds 11.5m for next year, giving earnings of 16.5p, the implied
prospective multiple of 17 suggests rather a lot of recovery is already
factored into the price and perhaps too soon.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Watchdog criticises GPG's accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPG, Sir Ron Brierley's UK investment company which has had its shares
suspended since December 1990, has been criticised by the Financial
Reporting Review Panel for breaches of accounting standards.
The panel, the UK's watchdog of corporate financial reporting, ruled that
GPG's latest set of accounts did not fulfil the requirement to comply with
current accounting standards.
It said the company's approach 'is not acceptable', but it held back from
requiring GPG to re-state its accounts or take other remedial action because
the treatment used is shortly to become mandatory.
GPG treated a Pounds 5.8m profit mainly generated from the disposal of MCG,
a subsidiary, as an exceptional item. The gain was classified as a
'discontinued operation', which would make it an extraordinary item under
existing accounting guidelines.
The result was to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 5m to Pounds 10.8m
and more than double earnings per share from 1.58p to 3.38p in the accounts
for the 12 months to September 30 last year.
The panel said the approach breached SSAP 6, the standard dealing with
extraordinary items and prior-year adjustments, and SSAP 3, which concerns
earnings per share.
However, it said the treatment was consistent with Fred 1, the exposure
draft on the profit and loss account issued by the Accounting Standards
Board, which is to become a standard next month and is likely to convert
nearly all extraordinary items into exceptional ones.
GPG's treatment is believed to be the reason for a statement issued by the
ASB in February stressing that its draft standards were subject to change
and should not be adopted until they became mandatory.
Mr Blake Nixon, GPG's UK executive director, said: 'I can't really get too
fussed about the thing. I'm not particularly sorry. I just see it as a storm
in a teacup.'
He said the company would have adopted the new treatment even if the effect
would have been to reduce profits and earnings. Mr Nixon added that it
reflected the approach favoured by Sir Ron Brierley, chairman, that it was
an improvement in the way to show profits, and it was in any case due to be
adopted shortly.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Ciments chairman resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIMENTS Francais, one of France's largest cement companies, was yesterday
clouded by controversy after the revelation of losses on off-balance sheet
financial dealings believed to amount to several hundred million francs.
The announcement triggered the resignation at an emergency board meeting
yesterday morning of Mr Pierre Conso as chairman. The discovery could have
serious implications for the sale earlier this year of a controlling stake
in Ciments Francais to Italcementi, the Italian building materials concern,
by Paribas, one France's most prestigious investment banking groups.
Italcementi, which in April agreed to pay about FFr6bn (Pounds 700m) for a
controlling holding in the heavily indebted French cement maker, identified
the off-balance sheet losses after an in-depth audit into Ciments Francais.
The discovery, first disclosed by a report in yesterday's Les Echos
newspaper, was later confirmed by the Ciments Francais board.
The original deal between Italcementi and Paribas preceded an unsuccessful
share placing in July, which left the French bank and Italy's Mediobanca
with large chunks of Ciments Francais' equity. Italcementi owns 45 per cent
of Ciments Francais, with Mediobanca holding 15 per cent and Paribas 34 per
cent.
Yesterday's revelation fuelled speculation that Italcementi may claim
compensation from Paribas for part of the purchase price. 'It looks as
though Italcimenti will try to get some form of compensation, even if it
involves a legal battle,' said Mr Pierre Boffet, construction analyst at the
James Capel securities house in Paris.
Paribas's shares fell sharply yesterday in Paris from FFr291 to FFr278.5.
Ciments Francais' shares were suspended in Paris, as were those of
Italcementi in Milan. Trading in the shares of Italmobiliare, which controls
Italcementi, was also halted.
Ciments Francais has been the centre of speculation upon its failure to
publish interim results, expected by analysts 10 days ago. They had been
expecting a sharp fall in operating profits from the FFr140m produced in the
first half of 1991, because of the depressed state of cement sales in its
main markets, France and Spain.

FT  08 OCT 92 / GA to buy Canadian group from the Pru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Accident, the Perth-based composite (general and life) insurer
yesterday announced that it has agreed to acquire the Canadian non-life
insurance business of the Prudential Corporation, the UK life and financial
services group, for CDollars 165m (Pounds 74m).
The deal, the biggest overseas acquisition by a UK insurer for some time,
signals the improving financial health of insurance companies such as GA
which are relatively free from exposure to loss-making domestic mortgage
indemnity business.
Prudential is keen to focus on life assurance and financial services
business. It said on Tuesday that its reinsurance subsidiary, Mercantile &amp;
General Re, was prepared to lose its share of the general reinsurance market
in search of higher margins.
Prudential hopes to distribute some CDollars 25m in capital from the company
before the sale, leaving CDollars 140m to be directly payable by GA.
GA is raising money for the deal through an issue of 13.5m ordinary shares,
which will be placed with institutional investors at 488p. The issue has
been fully underwritten by Hoare Govett and J. Henry Schroder Wagg.
The London market marked the shares of GA up 5p to 510p. 'From GA's point of
view I think it makes a lot of sense,' said Mr Paul Hodges, analyst with
James Capel, the securities house. Pru closed unchanged at 259p.
Mr Barry Holder, general manager finance at GA, said the price represented a
discount to net asset value of about 10 per cent and was a 'good deal' for
shareholders.
GA is now the biggest insurer in the Canadian market with a market share of
about 8 per cent, said Mr Holder, who said that Canada had been a
'profitable market' for GA.
The acquisition also helps GA diversify its Canadian business
geographically. GA's existing operations are heavily oriented towards
Ontario, while the Prudential earned nearly half its premiums in Quebec.
Separately, GA is still negotiating with the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society over the acquisition of 216,000 home insurance policies
underwritten by Municipal Mutual Insurance, the local authority-owned
insurer which ceased writing new business last week.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Bundesbank fuels rate cut hopes: German central bank softens
emphasis on M3 money supply measure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK has fuelled expectations of a further cut in interest rates
by softening the emphasis it places on one of its key indicators in the
growth of money supply.
German economists say the German central bank is drawing back from its
earlier insistence that the M3 measure of money supply - which includes cash
in circulation, current accounts and short-term deposits - should be
regarded as the most important indicator of domestic monetary stability.
'It is undoubtedly a change in the Bundesbank tone,' said Mr Wolfgang
Scheremet of the DIW economic research institute in Berlin.
'They are preparing a change in direction. We expect the bank to cut its
rates, but we are not sure when. Once they have changed direction, they
usually move fairly swiftly in the same direction with a series of decisions
in a relatively short space of time.'
The central bank's tough interest-rate policy has been based largely on its
concern that M3 growth at 9 per cent was well outside its target range of
3.5-5.5 per cent.
German economists, however, say Bundesbank statements this week on special
factors affecting M3 growth and a clear policy by the bank in recent days to
keep very short-term interest rates below 9 per cent are possible precursors
to further cuts in the Lombard and discount rates.
The latest indications have come in policy statements from Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, and from Mr Otmar Issing, a
fellow director and leading monetary hawk on the ruling council.
They follow a rising tide of criticism from German economists at the bank's
excessively rigid adherence to the M3 measure of money supply on the ground
that it has been distorted by the processes of unification.
Mr Tietmeyer said that the Bundesbank was 'very conscious that the
discussion about the measurement of the growth in money supply is influenced
by some special considerations.
'They include not only the expansion of credit in east Germany, and the
definition of a money supply target after reunification, but also the
quality of the M3 measure of money supply as an indicator, given an inverse
interest-rate structure, and the effects of currency inflows.'
The inverse interest rate structure refers to the fact that the bank's high
interest rate policy has kept short-term rates above long-term rates,
encouraging investors to switch to short-term deposits, which are themselves
part of the M3 measure.
'M3 is and remains for us naturally one important measure (for monetary
policy),' he confirmed. But he added: 'we know that there are currently a
series of other factors which must be taken into account and watched
closely.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Coal privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a stable utility like East Midlands Electricity buying a
stake in British Coal is enough to send a shiver down any shareholder's
spine. Fortunately it seems East Midlands' involvement in the nascent
Democratic Mineworkers consortium will be limited to advice, sympathy, and
perhaps a small equity stake. The employee buy-out team will have to go
elsewhere for most of its funds. The consortium's suggestion that it is
ready to buy the whole of British Coal must be regarded as kite-flying until
the financial backing becomes more substantial and the form of the sale
clearer.
Nonetheless it does focus attention on the risks faced by a buyer. If the
proposed five-year deal between the electricity generators and British Coal
goes ahead, the 20 most efficient pits might be profitable in the private
sector. Assuming that the government bears the cost of closing the 30
remaining collieries, it can expect very little net cash from the sale. The
buyer would be left with a five year contract with the generators - a very
short horizon for a mine operator - and an uncertain future after that.
Even if the government sweetens the deal to make it financially attractive,
it is hard to see a long-term future for the industry. It may face carbon
taxes and further environmental legislation as well as competition from
cheaper, cleaner imports. In cutting its losses, perhaps the Treasury hopes
to make something back on the sale of its remaining stake in National Power
and PowerGen.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Ciments Francais
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The size of the black hole uncovered by investigating accountants at Ciments
Francais can hardly be gauged from last night's brief statement. But the
resignation of the chairman - and the suspension of share quotes in Paris
and Milan - suggest that Italcementi may well seek to renegotiate the FFr6bn
it paid for a controlling stake in its French rival. Paribas, though, may
yet be the main victim. The French financial group, whose share price
yesterday slumped 4.4 per cent to FFr278, was not only the vendor in this
year's transaction; it retains a 34 per cent stake in Ciments Francais after
underwriting an unsuccessful share placing.
If there are financial horrors in this case, the episode will serve as a
warning to those now embarking on a fresh round of cross-border deals. The
pace of M &amp; A activity in Europe has markedly slowed in the third quarter,
but it would be wrong to think that the process of industrial restructuring
will be seriously derailed by doubts over Maastricht, or even currency
turbulence. The message is that even well-regarded groups - and Ciments
Francais, if highly geared and aggressive, was certainly that - may not be
everything they are cracked up to be.
The building materials and contracting sectors, of course, have been
particularly accident prone. Steetley's French aggregates business, for
instance, may have cost the UK company its independence, while Hochtief
(Rush &amp; Tomkins), Bilfinger &amp; Berger (Birse), and Dumez (McAlpine) can
hardly be thrilled with their UK investments. RMC and Redland, though, have
demonstrated the rewards for getting it right.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Anglian Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 3 per cent fall in Anglian Water's shares yesterday was inevitable given
Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez's decision to sell its stake. Less clear is why the
sector as a whole reacted badly. True, Pounds 110m institutional cash was
required to soak up the shares - money which may have been diverted from
elsewhere in the sector. More worrying is the sight of a well-informed
investor selling out at what, presumably, it perceives to be an opportune
moment. The timing is doubly curious as the stake was worth more to the
vendor before sterling was suspended from the ERM. But perhaps Lyonnaise has
reasons of its own.
It could certainly use the exceptional gain on its investment. The Dumez
contracting side - which includes a hefty exposure to the Channel tunnel -
will probably struggle again this year. More property provisions are also
likely. The poor performance of other listed investments, including minority
stakes in Havas, the French media company, and Alfred McAlpine, may have
narrowed the list of potential disposals to one.
While Anglian loses a useful minority shareholder, this will not jeopardise
co-operation with the French at an operational level. Anglian is probably
the least expansionist of all the UK water companies, but then the travails
of Lyonnaise over the past two years are hardly a glowing advertisement for
diversification.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: The cutting edge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
We should know a little more about UK economic policy after the chancellor's
speech today to the Tory party conference. It is already disconcerting,
though, to see how readily the knives are being sharpened to chop the
Jubilee Line extension. US experience demonstrates that lower interest rates
are not enough to induce recovery from a recession associated with deflated
asset prices. Admittedly its economic merits are arguable, but this is an
infrastructure project that would add to property values along its route and
create employment in a region where confidence is at a particularly low ebb.
The government may want to appear tough. The danger is that it will fall
into the classic trap of cutting capital spending because that is easier
than bearing down on current outlays.
Indeed, the scope for savings on wage costs may turn out to be strictly
limited, at least in the short term. This is partly because over a third of
public sector workers are subject to review body decisions, and partly
because of the knock-on effect of some large awards made around the
election.
The dilemma facing Mr Lamont is that his policy will scarcely have any
credibility if next year's PSBR is larger than the Pounds 32bn pencilled in
at the time of the Budget. It looks increasingly as though higher taxes will
also be needed to meet that target. Here, too, the options are limited.
Non-indexation of allowances and over-indexation of excise duties may yield
some extra revenue. In theory, it might not be bad for growth if fiscal
policy were more relaxed, but there is not just the question of the
chancellor's pride. The deficit still has to be financed.

FT  08 OCT 92 / German payment defaults rise: UK companies report sharp
increase in overdue export accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG EVIDENCE of the deepening difficulties faced by German industry came
yesterday from Britain's leading private export credit agency, which
reported a 68 per cent increase in payment defaults by German importers of
UK products.
A survey by NCM Credit Insurance, which took over the short-term export
finance arm of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department early this
year, shows an increase of 26 per cent in the number of overdue accounts
reported by its 6,000 UK customers.
It blames the rise on deepening recession in many of Britain's leading
export markets.
Problems are 'particularly worrying' in Germany, the study says.
The 68 per cent rise in overdue accounts, comparing the first eight months
of 1991 with the same period this year, compares with a 53 per cent increase
in France, 52 per cent in Sweden, 35 per cent in Spain and 34 per cent in
Italy.
About 40 per cent of overdue accounts eventually become full defaults, but
NCM said yesterday that the trend for defaults was identical to that for
overdue accounts.
An official at the BDI, Germany's leading business body, said German
companies were being squeezed hard by high interest rates and the collapse
of the market in the east of Germany, as well as economic troubles in
leading export markets such as Britain, the US and France.
'Because of economic downturn, there are certainly companies that are going
to the wall,' the official said.
According to Mr John Price, one of the authors of the NCM study, most
defaults in Germany are being reported in the small electrical machinery
sector. By contrast, the textile sector is giving greatest problems in
Spain, Italy and Sweden, with clothing sector showing the most severe
problems in France.
The study argues that the recent devaluation will provide only a modest
fillip to UK exporters.
'Devaluation may help British exporters in terms of price, but as the
worldwide recession continues, it increases the risk of non-payment by
importers who find their own domestic economies suffering,' the study says.
The NCM analysis shows that over the past five years annual losses reported
by British exporters because of payment default have risen by 170 per cent.
Worst experiences have been in Spain and Italy, which respectively show an
elevenfold and ninefold increase in losses. In Germany and Sweden, losses
have risen more than threefold.
NCM insures about Pounds 14bn of UK exports every year. The database used
for its study is drawn from information provided by the 6,000 exporters who
use its services.

FT  08 OCT 92 / BCCI debt proposal resisted by creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday fought to postpone approval of the once-and-for-all compensation
plan worked out by the bank's liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority
shareholders.
But Luxembourg's state prosecutor recommended that the Grand Duchy's
district court should clear the plan. The tribunal's final decision will be
announced on October 22.
At the court's request, BCCI creditors were balloted this summer on the
Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 950m) package of payments, which has already been
cleared by courts in Britain and the Cayman Islands.
Approval by Luxembourg, where BCCI had its brass-plate headquarters, would
end the legal procedure, although disgruntled creditors could still take the
case to the Grand Duchy's appeal court.
The compensation scheme was backed by about 90 per cent of the creditors who
voted. Mr Georges Baden, the Luxembourg liquidator, said the result
undermined his opponents' claims to speak for the majority of creditors.
But in a five-hour court hearing, critics of the compensation package argued
that there had been irregularities in the ballot and that new information
should be taken into account - notably the damning report of Mr Bob Kerry,
the US senator, on the BCCI collapse and the as-yet unpublished UK report by
Lord Justice Bingham.
Mr Masihur Rahman, formerly chief financial officer of BCCI, flew from New
York to voice his doubts about the settlement. 'The UK liquidators and the
Bank of England are hand in glove with the Abu Dhabi authorities in trying
to contrive this agreement,' he told the court.
Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary group on BCCI,
warned that approval of the agreement would rule out any further
compensation claims, if the Bingham report accused the Bank of England of
negligence in supervising BCCI.
Lawyers for the Abu Dhabi authorities rejected Mr Vaz's suggestions. They
said the report, which should appear in the same week as the court's final
decision, would not affect future claims. They and the liquidators argue
that rejection of the settlement could end creditors' chances of
compensation, or at least delay payments for years.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Protection of software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER SOMMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alan Cane's interesting piece about computer software faults
(Technically Speaking, October 6) suggests insurance as a route to
protection. This begs the question of why insurers would be willing to make
judgments about degrees of unreliability in computers that everyone else
baulks at.
The problem with hoping for an actuarial database to help determine premiums
is that nothing in the computer world - hardware platforms, operating
systems, applications programs - has a sufficiently long life for any
worthwhile data to be built up.
That is why those of us who advise underwriters in this area tend to use
more informal indicators. These include: reviewing development and testing
methodologies; looking for careful version release procedures; and
preferring systems which include such features as continual verification of
correct working and fail-safe arrangements. A further element is well
planned contingency and recovery planning.
The closest we get to actuarial data is a collection of anecdotes about
system failures which we can search via full text retrieval software.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Predators come out to play' (October 6), contrasts the
doubtful quality of Trafalgar House's assets and earnings with RHM. But the
largest single asset on RHM's balance sheet - brands - just appeared out of
the blue in 1988, valued on a basis one can only describe as imaginative.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Observer: European scoop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Thatcher's choice of The European for her onslaught on the government's
European policy seems a trifle bizarre.
After all, the weekly paper is supposed to be championing European unity,
not helping destroy it. It wouldn't have happened when Euro-buff Cap'n Bob
Maxwell was at the helm, that's for sure.
On the other hand, there must have been plenty of Fleet Street Knights who'd
have jumped at the chance of publishing the attack. The European's editor
Charles Garside insists that it was nothing less than a well planned scoop.
Lady T had written for his paper once before, and he asked her some time ago
to pen her latest essay.
He also denies that it had anything to do with the paper's new owners, the
reclusive Barclay twins, who are great admirers of the former prime
minister. Unlike Maxwell, the present proprietors do not interfere, and
Garside says that his paper is far more independent than it used to be. He's
keen to publish all shades of opinion. A fortnight ago, he gave EC president
Jacques Delors his head.
Whatever the reason for her choice, one of the more refreshing qualities of
the iron lady is that she so often operates outside the established
channels. Good for her, and well done The European.

<TEXT>
'Now put your mouth where your money is,' runs the latest message to
Brazil's foreign creditors from new president Itamar Franco in the wake of
his appointment of a solely Portuguese-speaking as well as unknown finance
minister.
Wouldn't certain communications problems be caused by his choice? No, said
Franco, who apparently feels that having the developing world's largest debt
puts one in a commanding position.
The international financial community 'will just have to learn Portuguese',
he added (raising eager speculation about which words from the phrase book
Citicorp vice-chairman Bill Rhodes will choose to respond with). And anyway
'Japanese is more useful than English'.
Franco also provided an object lesson in unflappability that even John Major
might envy. Challenged about a drop in the Sao Paulo stock market that makes
the London decline look small in comparison, the Brazilian president said
simply: 'It's not up to financial markets to dictate economic policy.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a Japanese version of the old biblical tale of Susanna and the elders,
women employees of Tokyo brokers Yamaichi Securities were bathing nude at a
holiday resort when they discovered they were being spied on by male
colleagues.
But this time the bathers did not need the prophet Daniel to save them from
the spies' iniquity.
Returning to work, one of the women pilloried the most prominent peeping Tom
through the company's computer system, broadcasting his name to over 100
branches. Moreover, she did so without revealing her own identity - which is
perhaps as well.
Announcing that the case was being investigated, a Yamaichi spokesman added:
'We understand the women were very angry, but of course this misuse of
computer terminals cannot be allowed.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Observer: Patten pattern
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After hyping his education bill as a 'landmark' document for taking schools
into the next century, education secretary John Patten has decided not to
trouble himself with responsibility for steering it through its detailed
Commons scrutiny in the autumn. He has handed that job on to Eric Forth, one
of the government's more flamboyant junior ministers.
Details have never been Patten's strong point. Headlines before small print
has been his watchword ever since his long stint at the Home Office.
Nor has the publicity knack deserted him. Damning this year's GCSE results
within days of publication, then comprehensively rubbishing the exam boards
again in a throwaway line at the Tory conference, are merely recent
examples.

It's all hands to the pump in customers' interests at Hewden Stuart,
according to chairman Sir Matthew Goodwin.
Witness the time he picked up a ringing phone in the Glasgow headquarters
and found he was talking to a disgruntled forklift-truck operator. Twenty
minutes later, a fitter was on site. But the performance isn't always as
good when seen from an in-company viewpoint, the forthright Scot admitted to
City analysts. A pump-hose he lately had delivered to his own home turned
out to be leaky, and drenched him in front of the lorry driver who'd brought
it.
What was his employee's reaction? 'He just laughed and said: 'You're the
chairman - you should see the service the customer gets'.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Observer: Forecasting nostalgia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Certain recent events have put rather a damper on today's celebrations of
the second anniversary of the UK joining the European exchange rate
mechanism. But it is good to know that, even though Britain is no longer a
member of the club, life in the Treasury still goes on as if nothing had
happened.
Take for instance one of its leading economists, Rod Whittaker, who over the
past year has been working to build ERM membership into the Treasury's
computerised economic model which is an essential tool in forecasting.
The mere fact that Britain has now left, with no immediate prospect of
rejoining, has not been enough to put him off his stride. Indeed, a paper
from the indefatigable Whittaker on his not-quite finished project -
entitled 'Simulating Economic Policy Within the ERM' - is to be presented at
a conference in London on December 1. Who knows, if only he had finished his
work on the model before Black Wednesday, we might now be celebrating
today's anniversary instead of ignoring it.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Base rate cut to tame markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ANTHONY JACOBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Why has the government failed to lower interest rates significantly
after achieving a 15 per cent devaluation of sterling? Industrialists
accepted reluctantly a 10 per cent base rate as the price for remaining in
the ERM when the severity of the recession in the UK required a base rate no
greater than America's equivalent, which is only 5 per cent.
Having been forced out of the ERM, there should have been an immediate
reduction in base rates by as much as 4 percentage points. Sterling might
then have fallen further than the 5 per cent it lost in the first few days,
but probably not lower than the current level of 15 per cent. Furthermore, a
4-point reduction in mortgage rates would have reduced the retail prices
index by 2.6 per cent, going some way to offset the increased cost of raw
materials caused by devaluation.
The failure to make a large cut in interest rates means that the currency
speculators can continue to speculate against sterling knowing that by
stages base rates will be reduced and therefore they can expect a one-way
downward market in sterling for some time to come.
While we cannot 'beat' the currency markets, we can at least understand how
they operate and thereby try and have them speculate in our favour rather
than against us.
This result can still be achieved by a further immediate substantial base
rate cut. With a combination of the likelihood of UK base rates thereafter
being increased as the economy recovers and German base rates being reduced
owing to the gathering recession in Germany, we may expect that in the
course of next year sterling will rise and the D-Mark will fall, so that
Britain's re-entry into the ERM may become possible. Meanwhile we are
suffering the worst of both worlds with depreciated currency and high base
rates.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Not speaking for all banks on currency speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You quote Mr Peter Wood, Barclays' finance director ('Banks defend
actions on Pounds deals', October 6), as speaking for all UK clearing banks.
This is simply not true.
We at the Co-operative Bank did not speculate against the pound using either
our own money or that of our customers. We restricted ourselves to dealing
for customers with genuine international trading requirements. We believe it
is unsound for a British clearing bank to speculate against the British
currency and the British economy using deposits provided by its British
customers and at the expense of the British taxpayer.
Judging by his reported comments Mr Woods is an apologist for some clearing
banks now terrified at the prospect of a full-scale inquiry into their
foreign exchange dealings over the past few weeks and the possibility of the
introduction of a special windfall tax on banks' dealing profits.
If the cap fits, Mr Wood, wear it, but do not purport to speak for all
clearing banks.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: An alternative view of the rate of life policies
lapsing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr N SCOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There was one aspect of the article about Scottish Widows that I fear
may have seriously misled your readers ('Scottish Widows ordered to review
20,000 life policies', October 7).
The article quoted figures from a survey carried out by the Securities and
Investments Board of policies which were terminated within the first two
years of the contract. However, this month's edition of Money Management
shows a rather different picture and, indeed, of the offices surveyed,
Scottish Widows has the lowest rate of policies lapsing - only 4 per cent
compared with the 22 to 45 per cent mentioned in the article.
The very thorough analysis we have carried out of policies sold by appointed
representatives has indicated no significant difference in lapse rates when
compared with Scottish Widows policies sold through independent financial
advisers.

FT  08 OCT 92 / A week of woes batters the bunker: Citicorp is reeling from
the surprise resignation of its president and poor earnings forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The executive suite at Citicorp, remarked a former member of the bank's
staff a few hours after the surprise resignation on Monday of Mr Richard
Braddock, Citicorp's president, 'is beginning to resemble a bombed-out
bunker'.
While unkind, the description appears increasingly apposite as the battle
scars left by huge loan losses, management shake-ups and an unusual amount
of regulatory attention become apparent. Still left standing - although only
just, in the view of many on Wall Street - is Mr John Reed, Citicorp's
embattled chairman.
It has been quite a week for the bank that ranks as America's biggest, with
total assets of Dollars 219bn. It has also proved one of the worst weeks for
Mr Reed since he took over as chairman and chief executive eight years ago.
First came Mr Braddock's resignation, which has left banking analysts
baffled. Citicorp's president was not only seen as Mr Reed's heir-apparent,
but also as his closest friend and collaborator inside the bank. An hour
later, the bank disclosed that its third-quarter earnings would be hit by
large write-offs, including Dollars 870m in the consumer division. This
comes on top of its well-publicised bad debt problems in the property
market. Third-quarter net earnings, the bank said on Monday, would be no
higher than 13 cents a share, or about half the figure many analysts
expected.
The bank, which has been scrambling this year to bolster its capital by
disposing of assets and issuing stock, picked a bad time to announce Mr
Braddock's departure. Today, Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, will meet
institutional investors to begin promoting a Dollars 650m preferred stock
offer for Citicorp. Wall Street observers also believe the bank is planning
an offer of up to Dollars 1bn of ordinary shares to further strengthen its
capital base.
After Monday's announcements, Citicorp's share price fell by 5 per cent to
Dollars 14 3/4 , bringing the overall fall to almost 25 per cent over the
past 60 days.
The slide in the share price appears to stem partly from criticism by US
bank regulators. In August regulators forced Citicorp to reduce its
previously reported second-quarter earnings by Dollars 28m because the bank
had overstated the value of its mortgage-servicing business.
At the same time it emerged that the Federal Reserve and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) had also pressed Citicorp to sign a
memorandum of understanding to accept closer oversight by the regulators.
Yesterday Citicorp disclosed that the restrictions include a ban on new
acquisitions or adding to assets without regulatory approval.
Last month, in an embarrassing leak of a report from the OCC, criticism of
Citicorp's mortgage business was detailed, including allegations that there
were serious management and credit-quality problems at the bank.
Despite these problems, Citicorp appeared to be back on the road to recovery
during the second quarter. But persistent bad debts in the property market
as well as the latest profit forecasts have caused Mr Tom Hanley, senior
banking analyst at First Boston, the investment bank, to slash his 1992
full-year net earnings estimates from Dollars 218m, or 60 cents per share,
to Dollars 73m, or 20 cents a share, and 1993 estimates from Dollars 728m,
or Dollars 2 per share, to Dollars 546m, or Dollars 1.50 a share.
The bank's prospective underlying financial performance thus seems weaker
than it did a few months ago. Its most recent return on assts, released on
June 30, was 0.30 per cent - about half the average of the US banking
industry. But it is not merely the bank's financial performance that has
attracted negative attention from Wall St: observers have been angered by
the bank's failure to offer more than an anodyne explanation for Mr
Braddock's departure.
Mr Raphael Soifer, a bank analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Company, the
investment bank, has noted that Mr Braddock's departure 'raises a lot of
questions about the management of Citicorp'. The decision by Mr Reed not to
appoint a successor has compounded concerns. 'As we all know, John Reed is
on the road a lot. That means a lot of times Citicorp is being run by
committee, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.'
Mr George Salem, of Prudential Securities, put it more bluntly. It was
ironic, he said, that Mr Braddock should be leaving the bank 'because
Braddock was a stronger manager than Reed'.
The Braddock resignation followed the departures of two other top Citicorp
managers with close ties to Mr Reed - Mr Michael Callen, the head of
corporate and investment banking in Japan, Europe and North America who was
replaced last January and Mr Lawrence Small, the vice-chairman who left in
June 1991. Several observers suggest that both Mr Braddock and Mr Callen
have been made into scapegoats for Citicorp's recent loan problems and
encouraged to leave by Mr Reed to show bank regulators that he is making
crucial management changes in important areas. Some middle-ranking
executives at the bank, especially those associated with Mr Braddock, are
said to be concerned about their own job security.
The news of Mr Braddock's departure has renewed doubt about the future of Mr
Reed himself. Citicorp, however, has denied that his tenure as chairman and
chief executive is in doubt.
A senior Citicorp executive yesterday acknowledged that there had been 'a
lot of speculation over the past 18 months about John's future'. He added,
however, that 'if anything, the departure of Braddock should put that
question to rest'. Mr Braddock's resignation left Mr Reed unchallenged at
the top of the bank.
The A-team at Citicorp is now a five-man group, led by Mr Reed and including
Mr William Rhodes, the veteran Third World debt specialist who has taken
over responsibility for problem loans. Also on the team is Mr Paul Collins,
another Citicorp veteran in charge of corporate matters and the bank's
capital position. Mr Pei-yan Chia, promoted to head the bank's consumer
division, is the fourth man on the team, which is rounded out by Mr Onno
Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister who is described by the bank as
the architect of its global finance strategies.
At the time of Mr Ruding's appointment last January Mr Reed said he was
moving the bank's top management to 'a much more primitive structure' to
achieve better credit controls. Mr Reed also admitted: 'One of the things I
have been correctly criticised for is that the management (of the corporate
division) has produced some pretty horrendous results. We are guilty of
having run the business a bit cavalierly.'
These sort of mea culpas from Mr Reed - and there have been several over the
past two years - have had the effect of fuelling more speculation about his
future rather than dampening such talk on Wall Street. Proof of solid
management, evidence of recovery in earnings and improved capital ratios
will be needed to lay such speculation to rest.
