FT  03 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: Chelsea blooms anew
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHELSEA Crafts Fair, now in its 13th year, seems to gain in reputation
and prestige every year, if not in size. Few would probably dare to quarrel
with its own assessment of itself as 'Europe's Finest Crafts Fair'.
Gathered together under one roof is a vast range of individual, original
hand-made work ranging from something as familiar as a traditional white
willow picnic basket, as simple as a wooden bowl, and as eccentric as a
curvy candlestick embellished with opals.
There are uniquely expensive pieces such as the Stevenson Brothers'
hand-carved rocking horses (which it seems adults are as much addicted to as
children), Roger Copple's wooden chess set or Alex Monroe's intricate brass
sundials, all of which might make special anniversary presents and could be
passed down from one generation to another.
But there is also a great deal that seems very well-priced, like Diane
Flint's 10in high pewter candlesticks, photographed here right, which cost
Pounds 28 for the pair and come embellished with opals. There are some
exquisitely simple ash and oak bowls by James Marston which range from
Pounds 15 upwards or little wooden toys by Roger Copple from Pounds 5, and
lots of beautiful jewellery with a great deal to choose from at under Pounds
50. Pictured below is a collection of Mark Nuell's rings - all are hand-made
from silver and 22 carat gold and he uses precious and semi-precious stones
which he hand-cuts. Prices start at Pounds 100 for ear-rings; the rings are
Pounds 170 each.
As usual the fair is on at the Chelsea Old Town Hall, King's Road, London
SW3 and runs for two weeks. There is a complete change of exhibitors after
the first week so anybody with a serious interest in the crafts really needs
to go both weeks. The first week runs from October 6 to 11 and the second
from October 13 to 18. The entrance fee is Pounds 4 for a single visit,
Pounds 6 for one visit during each week.

FT  03 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: Chintz, swags, ribbon, bows: anything goes]
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REALLY good news is that if you are faced with blank walls and are
wondering which which way the decorating wind is blowing, you can relax  -
this is the year when almost anything goes.
At this week's Decorex in London, the interior decorating world's version of
the fashion world's catwalk shows where what style guru Peter York calls the
'chintz ladies and the obelisk boys' make free with the swags and the paint
effects, there were enough styles on offer to cover almost every mood, from
cool and minimalist to high baroque.
There were room-sets left over from some other, lusher age - so awash with
lavish fabrics, sumptuous bibelots and expensive finishing touches that one
wondered where their creators had been these last few years. There were
Gothic rooms and sweetly simple country rooms; there were baronial halls
bedecked in tartan and sumptuous boudoirs; and every now and again there was
something fresh that caught the eye.
Crabtree Kitchens, for instance, had put together a kitchen (photographed
right) which in spite being made up from the familiar traditional parts
managed to look clean, fresh and new - a thoroughly grown-up kitchen, all
sophisticated urbanity without an ancient curlicue or a false panel in
sight.
The cabinets have clean, simple lines and the hand-painted pewter finish
(layers of black are rubbed down to reveal the silver base coat and the
whole is finished with a protective lacquer) and dark green Corian marble
top adds a sleek, metropolitan gloss. Polished chrome is used for the
fittings - tee hinges, drawer pulls and hook latches.
If your notion of a proper kitchen veers more towards the farmhouse than the
chic, then it is worth noting that Crabtree Kitchens also has a Shaker, a
Provencal and a some simple wooden versions. Crabtree Kitchens is at The
Twickenham Centre, Norcutt Road, Twickenham, Middlesex TW2 6SR.
Side by side with the new softened metropolitan look is, of course, our old
friend the ethnic look. Rather the way in which new directions in fashion
usually start with the big designer names and then filter down to the
high-street, so it is in decorator-land.
Way back in the mid-eighties, when most of us were drowning in chintz and
faded grandeur was all the rage, a few of the prescient, avant-garde
designers began playing with motifs gleaned from primitive pieces. Bonetti &amp;
Garouste, a French design partnership, started it all by including African
references, such as hide and horns, in their furniture. In the avant-garde
interior fine porcelain and oil paintings made way for ancient artefacts and
African masks.
African colours like cream, brown and black began to predominate in
interiors and strong primitive lines became the rage. David Gill's gallery
at 60 Fulham Road, London, was a focal point for a lot of this new primitive
work. Global Village, with its clever combination of Third World
craftsmanship and Western sophistication, made the look available to those
who had neither the time nor the know-how to cart tribal masks from Africa,
low tables from Rajasthan, planters' chairs from Malaysia.
When Habitat explored the ethnic look last autumn the new tribal mood really
hit the high street. This autumn, Habitat has refined it further so anybody
still looking for the component parts can find them at very accessible
prices. There is plenty of cream and brown, there are wooden artefacts that
look hand-turned, and wrought iron candelabra and hand-forged steel. There
are traditionally-woven rugs from India, some exceedingly attractive,
generously-sized pewter, brass and stone lampbases, driftwood frames and
lots of rattan - that other essential for the right-on nineties home.
Habitat's prices seem to me good - its very attractive range of checked
cotton fabrics at Pounds 2.95 to Pounds 8.75 a metre are some of the best
value I have come across. A large rough-looking (on purpose, you understand)
painted cupboard is Pounds 399 while for Pounds 349 you could get a Carrara
marble-topped table big enough to seat six. The catalogues are available now
from Habitat stores and larger newsagents at Pounds 2.

INTERIOR designing, as anybody who has ever tried it knows only too well, is
much less a matter of choosing pretty colours and much more a lot of sheer
know-how, painstaking attention to detail and real hard work.
If you still think that is what you would like to do, KLC runs one of the
best interior design training diploma courses around and it has a few places
on the 30-week course starting next week. The price may seem high (Pounds
9,400 plus VAT) but if offers proper professional training and almost all
its ex-pupils have no trouble finding work, even in these dire times.
It covers everything from budgeting and programming to lighting, plumbing
and, of course, the decorative side. It is a chance to rub shoulders with
and learn from working professionals, people of the calibre of Bert Chapman,
who did all the curtains for the newly-restored Hampton Court, Janet Turner
of Concorde Lighting and a host of practising architects and designers.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Iraqi assets to be seized by UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations security council last night directed states that hold
blocked Iraqi oil assets to seize them to pay for food and medicines for
needy Iraqis, begin compensating victims of the invasion of Kuwait and meet
some UN peacekeeping costs.
The resolution, adopted by 14 to 0 with China abstaining, sets a limit of
Dollars 200m (Pounds 112m) per state holding funds. The money must be
transferred 'as soon as possible' to an escrow account administered by Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general.
Officials estimated combined proceeds at a minimum of Dollars 1bn. The US
holds the bulk of the Dollars 4bn in Iraqi assets which were frozen after
the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
Iraq may still avert the punitive measure by ending its refusal to export up
to Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil every six months to pay for essential imports
and compensation claims. That provision was approved last year in the first
relaxation of sanctions.
In the general assembly this week, the Iraqis again objected that the terms
insulted their national sovereignty. In a bid to head off last night's
resolution, they asked instead to be allowed to sell Dollars 4bn worth of
oil, mainly for relief. They also offered to donate 5 per cent for non-Iraqi
aid, including some to Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Much of the cash raised by the seizure of assets is intended for more than
3m Kurds facing famine in northern Iraq.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Fears grow over coal job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, met Mr John Major, the
prime minister, yesterday amid growing government worries over the economic
effect of massive job cuts in the coal industry.
The forthcoming privatisation of British Coal will be accompanied by about
30,000 job losses and pressure is mounting from local MPs to cushion the
impact of what is likely to be the most severe employment cut yet in a
state-owned concern.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister who will handle the privatisation, was
also at the meeting.
The shrinkage of British Coal to a commercially viable size will devastate
areas of north-east England where there are virtually no other sources of
employment.
However, the government's determination to curb public spending in the wake
of sterling's devaluation appears to have shut off the alternatives of
postponing the privatisation or subsidising pits to keep them in operation.
There is a possibility of small amounts of EC money to help coal
communities.
The government still plans to introduce a British Coal privatisation bill,
probably by November, to keep to the timetable of auctioning British Coal
next year.
It also intends to press ahead regardless of whether new coal-based
electricity contracts are agreed in the coming weeks.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Labour tactical on Maastricht Bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party, which ended its conference in Blackpool yesterday, is
refusing to be explicit about its tactics when the Maastricht bill resumes
its Commons stages, Ralph Atkins writes.
Although the Labour leadership backs the principle of closer European union,
Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, said the party would want to examine
the bill's content, particularly in the light of any changes made to satisfy
the Danish people.
She said Labour would oppose attempts by the government to impose a
'guillotine' on the bill - a measure restricting the time allowed for debate
which is usually used to prevent filibustering by opponents.
Labour is conscious that the divide among its MPs over Maastricht is
substantial, although probably not as deep as among Conservatives.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Phones may transmit data from ambulances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S ambulance service may be catching on to high technology.
A project run by the Department of Health's Trauma Centre based in north
Staffordshire is testing the use of cellular phones to transmit
heart-tracing data between ambulances and hospitals.
The trial project to use cellular phones on ambulances is thought to be the
first of its kind in the UK and is part of a government-backed study to look
into ways of improving communications in the ambulance service.
Ambulances in the UK now use two-way radio, which is a much less reliable
form of communication than cellular telephony. When the radio link fails,
ambulance crew are forced to use public pay phones.
The radio communications network is not used in the UK to transmit heart
data but experiments in the US found radio communications unreliable for
that purpose, says Mr Simon Davies, an accident and emergency nurse at Keele
University who is participating in the project,
Cellular telephony, on the other hand, can handle large volumes of data and
voice very rapidly and is much more reliable. In the US, cellular telephones
are commonly used by ambulances.
The Trauma Centre's project is targeted specifically at heart attack
patients. ECG heart tracing machines are installed in ambulances to read
heart data which is transmitted directly to the hospital by connecting the
ECG unit to a cellular phone.
The use of the cellular phone network also enables the ambulance paramedics
to receive advise directly and reliably from specialists at the hospital and
take speedy and appropriate action.
The high-fidelity communication between ambulance and hospital offered by
cellular phones means that the patient can be directed to the nearest
hospital equipped to deal with the specific case. The centre will use
cellular phone supplied by Motorola of the US.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Care reform funds win approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS VIRGINIA BOTTOMLEY, health secretary, yesterday announced funding
arrangements for next year's community care reforms which social services
directors and political opponents acknowledged were reasonable in the
present state of public expenditure.
She surprised delegates to the local authorities social services conference
on the Isle of Wight with an announcement that, in the early years of the
reforms, part of the finance will be subject to 'ring fence' protection to
ensure that it is spent on community care rather than on other purposes.
Next April, local authorities will become responsible for co-ordinating a
policy designed to help elderly and handicapped people to remain in the
community rather than have to enter institutions. Spending on keeping people
in private residential and nursing homes has soared from Pounds 10m in 1979
to about Pounds 2.5bn now.
Although the position of people already living in residential homes will be
unaffected, money that would have been spent on accommodating further people
will be transferred from the social security budget to local authorities.
Under the proposals, English local authorities will receive Pounds 539m in
community care grants in 1993-94 - Pounds 399m transferred from the social
security budget and a further Pounds 140m towards the start-up costs of the
new system. Sums transferred in lieu of social security expenditure that
would have been incurred under the existing system will rise to a cumulative
Pounds 1.050bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 1.568bn in 1995-96.
The government had decided, Mrs Bottomley said, that in the crucial early
years of the new policy, the new elements of community care finance needed
temporary ring-fencing.
All Pounds 539m in 1993-94 will be protected. After that, protection will be
restricted to the additional funds transferred from the social security
budget in 1994-95 and 1995-96. In that way, ministers hope to guarantee that
funds earmarked for community care are actually spent on the reforms.
Mr Toby Harris, Labour chairman of the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities' social services committee, acknowledged that Mrs Bottomley had
fought 'a substantial battle to get the figure she has announced'. The AMA
believes, however, that there is a Pounds 200m shortfall in the Pounds 399m
due next year arising from differences in government and AMA calculations of
the rate of growth in people needing residential care.
Mr Peter Smallridge, director of Kent Social Services and chairman of the
Association of Directors of Social Service, said the immediate reaction of
social services directors was that Mrs Bottomley had done well to secure the
proposed level of funding and protection.
The government says the Pounds 399m transferred from social security must be
spent in the private and voluntary sectors. Mrs Bottomley said the reforms
were not intended to become 'a trigger for a great expansion of
local-authority-operated services'. The government hopes the funding changes
will lead the private sector to open up domiciliary and day care facilities.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: My kind of place in the Big Apple - Grand
Hotels / Jancis Robinson stays at the Lowell and Nicholas Lander at the Mark
in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON and NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU listened to all the advice from Gerry Frank, author of the invaluable
Where to find it, buy it, eat it in New York you may never stay in that
fascinating city.
Do not, he advises, give out your room number to strangers, charge calls to
your room or touch anything in the refrigerator. And, in the present
depressed climate, do not accept the quoted room rates. All kinds of deals
are possible.
Many of the city's newer hotels were planned in happier times. You can
choose from: Essex House, Mercer, St Regis or Ian Schrager's trio, Morgan's,
Royalton or the Paramount. And, as befits a city where the dollar is king,
the competition is fierce, particularly between two sumptuous hotels
situated within a block of New York's greatest natural asset, Central Park.
THE LOWELL
It is rare to encounter a hotel bed you would happily substitute for your
own back home but I did, last May in Manhattan, in suite 14B of the Lowell,
a determinedly small, discreet hotel on the Upper East Side that is
part-British owned.
It is significant that the Lowell is the only member of the French-based
Relais &amp; Chateaux hotel and restaurant group to be found in New York City.
Its decor and spirit are deliberate throwbacks to a quiet but grander age.
One friend told me she had seen Mickey Rourke in the tiny lobby, another
that New York's most eligible bachelor (ie a recently divorced billionaire)
had taken up residence there. European guests tend to be FT readers, I noted
in the chintzy first-floor Pembroke Room which the management consciously
dedicates to power breakfasts.
In many ways the Lowell is indeed the antithesis of the American hotel
stereotype. One can not only open the windows but, in 10 of the 48 suites,
walk out on to one's own balcony and marvel at the proximity of Central Park
(and the paucity of roof gardens).
The grumbling mini-bar is replaced by a kitchen larger and better equipped
than the average resident New Yorker's (although the equipment in mine was
tellingly unused). TV screens have to be sought out inside Chinese lacquer
chests and mahogany tallboys. Gideon's bible may well be augmented by five
shelves full of books such as 21 Sure Fire Ways To As Much As Double Your
Money.
Rooms are deliberately furnished with desks large enough to accommodate a
raft of company reports and one king-bedded suite, surely not aimed at
Europeans, even has its own separate gym, CD system, woodfire, dining area,
two bathrooms, three TVs and seven telephones (two fewer than the
presidential suite).
In the same building is the Post House restaurant and bar, famous for its
steaks, wine list and clubby atmosphere, particularly during immediately
post-Wall Street hours. A useful place, but not for impoverished female
vegetarians.
Room rate from Dollars 260 (Pounds 152) for one of their four singles but
Dollars 520 (Pounds 304) for a one-bedroomed suite such as 14B.
The Lowell Hotel, 28 East 63 St, New York. Tel: (212) 838 1400, fax (212)
319 4230.
THE MARK
In any part of what Americans succinctly call the hospitality business first
impressions are vital - perhaps none more so than in an hotel after a
transatlantic flight and an even bumpier cab ride.
Here was the first of The Mark's attractions, their Head Doorman. During my
five-day stay the doorman whispered an instantaneous weather report, never
failed to give me a smile and immediately knew where I could conveniently
buy the FT.
The hotel's physical charm stems from the fact that it was originally a
residency building, built in 1926 and known as the Hyde Park, and converted
into an hotel five years ago as the New York flagship of the Munich-based
Rafael Group. My room had all the amenities that corporate good taste and
the big budgets of the 1980s could buy. The finishing touch was a pair of
extremely comfortable leather slippers left by the bed on the first night.
The Mark has invested heavily in its restaurant. The chef Philippe Boulot,
born in Normandy, has worked with two of Paris's most famous chefs, Robuchon
and Senderens. Raymond Bickson, the general manager, was born in Hawaii,
educated at the Goethe Institute in Berlin and Cornell University and was
consultant to the Peace Hotel in Shanghai. Bickson and Boulot bring a very
cosmopolitan air to what is an intimate, although occasionally sombre,
dining room. They have organised a diverse sequence of dinners with wine
producers from California, France, Germany and Portugal, for which they
charge reasonable prices (from Dollars 50-Dollars 70 including wines), and
built up a first-class wine list.
But they also know what is going on in the Big Apple. When an early morning
appointment took me down to Wall Street they told me to call in for
breakfast at Florent (69 Gansevoort Street, 989-5779). Originally a coffee
shop straight out of an Edward Hopper painting, Florent is now a
cafe/restaurant open 24 hours and run by a Frenchman. At the bottom of his
menu is a phrase all hoteliers would love to copy: 'We are pleased to accept
cash only.'
The Mark, Madison Avenue, East 77th Street. Tel: 212-744-4300, fax
212-744-2749. Rooms from Dollars 265 plus taxes.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Drink: Fond farewell to a strict mistress - Jancis Robinson
and 1,900 pink roses - salutes the end of a tasting era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOWARDS the end of the night Lalou Bize-Leroy confessed it would be her last
September tasting. The last time she would spend a week preparing her
sumptuos Burgundian farmhouse for its annual influx of the great and the
good in the wine buying and wine writing worlds.
Every September since 1964 they have climbed the hills above Meursault, in
their Mercedes and Porsches, to be ritually humiliated.
Many of the world's more reputable wine tasters will sleep easier now, safe
in the knowledge that never again will they have to participate in this
famous blind tasting competition, although the wines were so good that it
always seemed worth running the risk of making a fool of oneself. This year,
for example, we were served 33 different vintages of the great red burgundy,
Le Chambertin, back to 1933. All we had to do, as mystery glass after glass
washed over us, was say which year was which.
Lalou, as we all call her, as though she were our intimate, is probably the
wine world's most famous woman, most famous at the moment for a bitter,
public and extremely expensive dispute with her former business partner and
her sister. But she is famous for far more than being the former co-director
of the fabulous Domaine de la Romanee-Conti who has so infuriatingly set up
her own rival Domaine Leroy along the village back streets of Vosne-Romanee.
An awesome, and unusually glamorous, taster, she is passionate about her
wines, and now vines, almost to the point of clinical mania. The grapes that
arrive at her newly-equipped winery are treated, as she says herself, like
the most tender strawberries.
Showing me six men poring over the slowest sorting belt, the shallow trays
in which the grapes are transported, the holes deliberately punched so that
any excess moisture simply runs away, the serried ranks of brand new wooden
vats and the specially-designed cruising metal substitute for the more
brutal human foot, she asked helplessly: 'Surely any Financial Times reader
would be horrified by the craziness of this sort of investment?' (around
Pounds 8m to make hardly 7,000 cases of wine a year).
In the perfectly-kept cellars below, French wine oracle Michel Bettane and I
are taken on a cask-by-cask tour of the 1991 vintage. Thanks to her
fastidiousness, and her gifted and compliant winemaker Andre Porcheret, they
are marvels of geographical expression. But even in the one or two cases
where we express the minutest reservation, we are corrected. No mother is
more besotted.
In the great Richebourg vineyard we are asked to marvel at the smallness,
ripeness, paucity, upright stance of her 'biodynamic' grapes  - especially
in comparison with those of a particularly famous holding next door . . .
This is a woman whose idea of relaxation is to pit her tiny frame against a
rockface.
The stated purpose of her September tastings is to make her guests taste
great burgundy with due attention, but it has not always felt like that.
Lalou, in Chanel or perhaps Lacroix, welcomes her guests outside with a
glass of mystery white, her stilettos crunching the gravel that separates
her stone farmhouse from the ancient trees encircling it.
In 1988, my initiation year, guests included Bocuse the chef, Broadbent the
auctioneer, Duboeuf the Beaujolais, Domecq the sherry, Wasserman the broker,
as well as a host of collectors and writers from both sides of the Atlantic.
This year there was a significant Japanese presence - hardly surprising
since Lalou's important new vineyard acquisitions have been heavily financed
by her Japanese agents Takashimaya. Eventually, we take our places inside
where sideboards are already charged with the lobsters, ecrevisses, wild
rice, pates, sweetbreads and sweetmeats that have been pouring out of
Lalou's kitchen over the last few days. (Hers is surely the only table in
France where truffles are easier to find than bread.)
Yet another perennial distraction from the dozens of mystery wines to come
has been a heady array of flowers, this year no fewer than 1,900 pink roses
in that perfect state between bud and bloom. But the most daunting aspect of
the tasting is that each of the 50 or 60 guests, many of them senior figures
in the world of wine, is given a notebook, from which we have to hand in to
Miss a page of our guesses for each flight of wines.
'One point will be given to each correct response,' it says. Sure enough,
the denouement of each September tasting has been the announcement of the
'winner'. The late Jean Troisgros usually managed more points than most, but
an outsider would probably be appalled by how few points are scored.
Lalou may patrol the room declaiming the obviousness of various wines but,
as Michael Broadbent of Christie's, author of several wine tasting bibles,
freely admits: 'I always make an absolute balls of it.'
Michel Bettane, who has occasionally been top scorer, managed just 4 out of
40 one year, as did Matt Kramer, author of Making Sense of Burgundy. This
year's winner, Martine Saunier, Lalou's all-important American importer
identified 11 vintages out of the 33, for example.
We shall all miss our annual humbling. In fact, the whole equilibrium of
Burgundy seems upset by what has been a financial humbling for Lalou, who
has lost the lucrative rights to sell Domaine de la Romanee-Conti wines
(which used to account for three-quarters of Leroy's turnover.)
In its vast and sepulchral warehouses in Auxey-Duresses, the old negociant
business of Leroy still holds millions of pounds' worth of the older
vintages Lalou used to buy in before turning vigneronne. She had been hoping
that American guru Robert Parker would come to her tasting this year and
move a bit of stock by writing nice things about those venerable
Chambertins.
She says that in future years she may hold some sort of tasting not at home
but at the new domaine Leroy in Vosne-Romanee. It should certainly be
exposed to as many wine drinkers as possible, as a shrine to
single-mindedness.

but what exactly do they eat? Sue Style tells us in her excellently written
and presented A Taste of Switzerland (Pavilion, Pounds 15.99, 160 pages).
There is culinary life beyond the fondue and Style has put together the
elements that make up Swiss cuisine dealing in her usual authoritative and
engaging way with the country's food, wines, gastronomic traditions and
history.
Style's book is good value but many food books in that price category are
not, so it is nice to be able to point to a clutch of decent food books
costing under a tenner.
For those who like good writing as well as good eating Virago has published
a food anthology, Loaves and Wishes (Pounds 7.99, 152 pages). It brings out
a variety of responses to the request to write something - anything - about
food to mark Oxfam's 50th anniversary. Anger, wit, fantasy, storytelling,
poetry and more are interspersed with recipes. Authors include Maeve Binchy,
Germaine Greer, Doris Lessing and Virginia Woolf.
Glenfiddich-award winner Lynda Brown has experimented with a variety of
crops and ways of growing them organically. Her practical tips on planting
and harvesting make up The Cook's Garden (Pounds 8.99, Vermilion, 256
pages). Bean salads, scarpaccia and ways of tackling that most recalcitrant
of vegetables, the brussels sprout, make up a guide which even seasoned
kitchen gardeners will find worthwhile.
Last, but not least, a delightfully illustrated first series from John
Midgley - The Goodness of Beans, Peas and Lentils, Potatoes and Root
Vegetables, Garlic and Olive Oil (each 65 pages, Pounds 4.99, Pavilion).
Each book has 30 recipes and a basic information section. Ian Sidaway's
watercolours makes them top value.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Drink: Is it schnapps or vodka? - Giles MacDonogh enjoys an
unusual pick-me-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEDHOLMS FISK in Stockholm is one of only eight Michelin- starred
restaurants in Sweden. We were served a plate of Swedish hors d'oeuvres
rather in the manner of Russian zakuski. There was very lightly smoked
salmon and delicately marinated gravlax, which came with a rather sweet,
mustard sauce. Matjes and Bismarck herrings, salmon and bleak roe came from
fish caught above the Arctic Circle. To drink with this we received a glass
of Pripps lager and a tot of lemon-flavoured brannvin or schnapps.
I call it schnapps but the makers, the Swedish government monopoly Vin &amp;
Sprit, would rather it were called vodka. It is more a question of marketing
than semantics. Schnapps distilling is a Baltic tradition: the Swedish word
brannvin like the Dutch brandewijn means burnt wine; where the Russian word
vodka with its watery connotations is closer to the Swedish word for spiced
schnapps aquavit. Aquavit just means eau de vie or if you prefer, whisky.
I suspect that the Swedes feel that we might have trouble pronouncing
brannvin and perhaps they are right to call it vodka. Certainly the
tradition of making a highly rectified vodka in Sweden goes back for more
than 100 years. In 1879 LO Smith (he had assumed the name of his guardian,
who may or may not have been of British origin) began distilling an absolut
renadt brannvin (absolutely pure schnapps) at Reimersholm near Stockholm.
The spirit was distilled ten times until all impurities (and presumably all
flavour) had been removed. The Stockholmers loved the new drink, and when
the city fathers tried to prevent it being sold they took to their boats,
filling up their containers at Smith's Island distillery until the
authorities were forced to concede defeat.
When in 1979 the Swedish monopoly decided to launch a quality spirit on the
export markets, they remembered LO Smith and his 'Absolut' and Absolut Vodka
was born. Absolut is a highly rectified spirit, but not, I hasten to add,
quite so drastically cleaned up as Smith's original brew; rather more of the
grain flavour survives than in other commercial vodkas, but far less, say,
than you would find in a north German Kornschnaps.
Absolut now comes in three forms: straight vodka, 'citron' and pepper. The
flavouring of schnapps is another tradition which extends throughout
northern Europe and the Baltic, and in spite of the fact that quality grain
spirit is now distilled in only one place in the whole of Sweden, this
flavoured schnapps or aquavit continues to be produced.
Sweden's principal licit distillery is in Ahus in the south of the country.
It was there that I tried a range of these drinks: Herrgards a
licorice-tasting spirit aged in sherry casks; OP Anderson, a Swedish kummel;
Hallands Flader flavoured with elderflowers; porsbrannvin flavoured with
bog-myrtle, which gives it a suitably earthy, indeed swampy taste; Ostgota
Sades Brannvin which is essentially a Swedish grain whisky; Arsta, a
Stockholm speciality flavoured with bitter oranges; and Ahus Bitters which
tastes like the entire contents of the spice box macerated in alcohol.
In the 19th century there were as many as 200,000 distilleries in Sweden
making brannvin. Consumption was massive and drunkenness became such a
problem that a referendum was taken on whether to ban alcohol sales
altogether. The drinkers narrowly won the day, but the result of the poll
was the creation of the Swedish monopoly in 1917.
In the intervening 75 years the number of distilleries has been-whittled
down to just Ahus, a situation which no one feels will change once Sweden
joins the EC and the monopoly is finally wound up.
Brannvin schnapps or vodka (whatever you want to call it) goes very well
with basic Swedish food: the circles of crisp bread which were formerly hung
up to dry before the long winter; smoked, pickled, salted, cured or
marinated foods; oily herrings eels and salmon; roes of every description,
including the abominably salty turbot roe we ate in an otherwise fine
restaurant in the south of the country. Vodka is said to protect you from
tainted foods: hence the Russian habit of drinking it with what was often
putrid caviar.
Finally, brannvin was the traditional compliment to the smorgasbord. The
word means 'buttered bread' such as the German Butterbrot. In the last
century the smorgasbord was a male preserve; set out on a side table for the
men to eat while the ladies removed their travelling clothes prior to
dinner. In the centre of the table an enormous canteen was filled with
brannvin and two or three different sorts of aquavit arranged in separate
compartments; another section was filled with ice. Presumably it worked
wonders after an icy sleigh ride.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A SuperSaver offer that isn't quite so
super - Mike Truman casts an analytical eye over Norwich Union's promise to
'make your dreams come true'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE TRUMAN

<TEXT>
BEFORE a financial adviser can sell a policy, he is supposed to ensure that
it is appropriate to the client's circumstances. If he does not, he could
face a claim for damages from his client and an investigation by his
regulatory body.
No such rule protects those who reply to direct mail advertising and apply
for policies by post. One such product which hit doormats all over the UK
recently is the SuperSaver plan from Norwich Union.
The front cover of the mailer promises 'Cash to make your dreams come true]
A big cash payout when you're 65.' But the plan is not a pension policy. It
is a with-profits life assurance policy, so the premiums do not qualify for
tax relief and the growth in the fund is reduced by the tax the life company
has to pay.
The SuperSaver differs from a standard with-profits plan in several ways.
First, it does not offer a choice of policy term - the policy runs to age
65. Second, the premium increases by a fifth each year for the first five
years so that it has doubled from the sixth year on.
It has no medical requirement because, in case of non-accidental death, it
will pay out only the premiums paid (without interest) or the surrender
value, if higher. This makes the policy 'non-qualifying.' There will be a
charge to income tax on higher-rate taxpayers when the policy matures.
So, is it good value? The obvious comparison is with a personal pension
plan, since that is designed to produce a lump sum and pension at
retirement.
The SuperSaver illustration projects a capital sum of just under Pounds
860,000 at age 65 for a 20-year-old paying an initial premium of Pounds 60 a
month. This is based on the LAUTRO-approved growth rate of 10.5 per cent.
For a personal pension, the comparable growth is 13 per cent, to allow for
the tax exemption that pension funds enjoy. Since pension premiums get tax
relief, the same initial net premium of Pounds 60 would represent a gross
premium of Pounds 80.
Allowing for both these factors, the pension fund could be expected to reach
Pounds 2.2m. Of this, one-quarter (or Pounds 550,000) could be paid out as a
tax-free lump sum.
The remainder would have to be used to buy a pension for life, but this
could be 'guaranteed' so that at least five years' pension would be paid out
even if the recipient died sooner. On present annuity rates, a level pension
with such a guarantee would come to just under Pounds 200,000 a year.
So, the pension plan would pay Pounds 500,000 on maturity, tax free, plus a
further Pounds 1m (subject to tax) guaranteed over the following five years,
compared with the SuperSaver projected maturity payout of Pounds 860,000.
And the pension would go on paying Pounds 200,000 a year gross until death.
If the projected payout from SuperSaver is compared with that from the cash
lump sum and the first five years of a guaranteed personal pension net of
basic rate tax, it is not until the age of 50 that the SuperSaver projects a
better return - yet, it is advertised as a policy for those between 18 and
55.
The one group for whom this policy could have advantages is those who want
the 'death by accident' insurance and are in an occupation that makes this
difficult to get. A 20-year-old window cleaner who started paying Pounds 60
a month into a SuperSaver would have a death by accident benefit of Pounds
60,000.
Insurance broker Sutton Winson in Twickenham, west London, said the cheapest
policy it could find for someone in such an occupation was Pounds 96 a year
 -ironically, from Norwich Union. Eight pounds a month would start to make a
hole in his tax savings. But anyone without sufficient life cover should get
proper term assurance covering death from any cause, not just by accident.
Chris Armstrong, of Norwich Union's direct marketing division, pointed to
the traditionally high surrender values that the company pays on its
with-profits contracts. He said this gave more flexibility than a personal
pension in difficult times when people needed access to their money.
He agreed, however, that no one should enter into a long-term contract
intending to surrender it; a warning which is reinforced by the surrender
values presented clearly in the literature.
In no case is the surrender value (calculated under LAUTRO rules) projected
to exceed the premiums paid within the first five years.
Armstrong saw the contract as a savings plan for those who wanted something
more than a building society but did not want the risk of direct equity
investment. It was not a replacement for pension planning, he said.
But for those who have inadequate pension arrangements, it seems that
SuperSaver is not quite so super after all. 'The most appropriate targets
for this plan are people who want to save for a cash lump sum and who are
already in pension schemes or who do not have the option of joining one,'
said Armstrong.

THE WEEK has seen a very even balance between purchases and sales. It began
with the disposal of 1m shares by Sir Tom Cowie, chairman of T. Cowie, the
eponymous contract hire and leasing company which is one of the few in the
motor sector to have performed consistently well since the dark days of 1990
(although it failed recently in its bid to acquire a rival car and coach
company, Henlys).
The share price performance of Menvier-Swain resembles that of Cowie: it
reached a low point at the end of 1990 and has performed well ever since.
The chairman, Charles Swain, has sold 290,000 shares at 425p, more than
double their price at the beginning of 1991. He retains more than 1.25m.
Nursing homes is one area of the economy which appears to have bucked the
general downward trend. Takare is the UK's largest operator of nursing homes
and has benefited accordingly. Keith Bradshaw and Deverok Pritchard,
chairman and deputy chairman respectively, each sold 800,000 shares at 201p.
The sales were made to enable them to repay borrowings, and each retains
more than 11m shares.
Bryant, the housebuilding group, reported final results recently which were
better than analysts' best expectations. On the day they were announced,
chairman Alan Bryant, together with his wife, bought a total of 8,169,250
shares at 75p. The stake was acquired from Royal Insurance and, effectively,
doubles his holding.

MORE bad news from the recession in construction, property and housing
sectors is expected on Thursday with three victims reporting results.
Higgs and Hill took exceptional charges of Pounds 20.9m and reported a
pre-tax loss in the year to December 31, and is expected to post minimal
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 500,000-Pounds 800,000. The interim
dividend will likely be slashed to 1.5p (6p).
Ibstock Johnsen, the brick and building materials manufacturer, has also
been having a tough time. Interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m
(Pounds 7.2m) are forecast. Its interim dividend also looks under pressure
and could be cut to 1p or even a halfpenny (2.25p).
However hopes are brighter for Tilbury Douglas. Interim profits of Pounds
6.5m (Pounds 6.6m) are expected and the 10 1/2 p dividend looks safe. The
company is expected to maintain its reputation as one of the few in the
construction sector to be coming through the recession relatively unscathed.
Grampian Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate which set the ball rolling
in the bidding for Macarthy last year, is expected to show on Wednesday an
interim profit on its continuing activities of Pounds 2.5m, down from Pounds
3.4m.
The picture is complicated by the sale of the Mitre business, maker of
footballs and other sporting goods. The largest part of Grampian is the
animal pharmaceuticals division. The performance of the tourist retailing
side is traditionally biased towards the second half.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Councils are hit by troubles at MMI -
But individual policyholders have less cause to be concerned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEMISE of Muncipal Mutual (MMI), the UK's ninth-largest insurer, is
causing serious problems for Britain's local authorities which are facing
increases in premiums and are without cover in some cases. But individuals
who have bought home, motor, health and life insurance policies from MMI and
its subsidiaries should not get too worried by its well-publicised problems.
On Wednesday, the company stopped writing new business or renewing existing
policies, and ceased temporarily to pay claims. MMI, which insures nine out
of 10 metropolitan, county and district councils, stumbled into difficulties
following rapid expansion into new insurance markets in the 1980s when it
undercut many of its competitors.
MMI also suffered from a sharp rise in legal actions for negligence against
local authorities like Staffordshire, which was hit hard by claims from
victims of the 'pindown' disciplinary regime in its childrens' homes.
Across the country, councils also have been hit by a surge in minor public
liability claims, such as those from people who have suffered accidents on
badly-maintained roads.
In May, MMI reported that it had been forced to inject millions of pounds
into its reserves to pay for future claims, leaving it with insufficient
capital to continue trading at present levels. Net assets at the end of 1991
amounted to Pounds 4.9m compared with net premium income of Pounds 785m.
Following a change in senior management, the company began efforts to
transfer its business to other insurance companies. But this has proved
difficult and this week's announcement followed the breakdown of rescue
talks with a French company, La Garantie Mutuelle des Foncionnaires.
MMI's managers are hopeful they can avoid a full-scale liquidation. One
possibility being explored by the company, along with its local authority
owners, is to set up what accountants call 'a scheme of arrangement' with
creditors.
If this were to be agreed, Municipal Mutual would remain intact in order to
pay all claims on policies sold already, disposing of all its liabilities in
an orderly fashion. Individual and commercial policy-holders alike could
expect to receive full payment of any claims as the company ran down its
asset base of more than Pounds 1.3bn.
The group's health and life subsidiaries are in better shape. Prime Health
is continuing to write new business and renew existing policies, while
Prosperity Life Assurance will continue to issue renewals but will not issue
new policies.
In addition, the company still hopes it can transfer its 1m or so individual
home and motor policies to other companies. Already, a number of 'block'
policies - sold on insurers' behalf by building societies - have been
transferred.
Since January 1990, Cheltenham and Gloucester building society has sold
216,000 MMI policies (mainly home and contents) to its mortgage borrowers.
The society has negotiated in principle to transfer all these policies to
General Accident, the Perth-based composite (general and life) insurer.
Norwich and Peterborough building society, which has sold 22,000 MMI
policies, has switched the block to Norwich Union, with which it is already
insuring the remaining one-third of its block polices. Most of the policies
came up for renewal on September 29. Terms and conditions remain unchanged.
Even if the worst happens and MMI does eventually go into liquidation,
individual policyholders will have most of their claims paid.
The Policyholders' Protection Board - established in 1975 after a number of
insolvencies in the late 1960s and 1970s - meets 90 per cent of all non-life
and life claims from individual policyholders.
In the case of compulsory policies - such as third party motor insurance -
the PPB pays 100 per cent of all valid claims.
Municipal Mutual policyholders who bought their policies from AA Insurance
Services, the broker, also will receive full payment for all valid PPB
claims, with the AA making up the difference between the 90 per cent paid by
the PPB and the full value of the claim.
Around 80,000 motorists have bought MMI policies from the AA. MMI also was
part - along with three other insurers - of an AA scheme which sold 300,000
home policies.
The PPB is financed by the insurance industry as a whole, and a liquidation
by Muncipal Mutual would lead to some of its heaviest payouts yet. In recent
years, claims have been paid by the PPB following the insolvencies of
Continental and Trinity Insurance in 1992, NEMGIA in 1991, and Cavalier
Insurance in the mid-1980s.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home loans come down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in interest rates has been followed by an avalanche of fixed-rate
mortgage offers from the main building societies. Several are at well below
9 per cent and one lender, National Counties, has even put a variable-rate
mortgage on the market with a discount that brings it down to 7.99 per cent.
Even people who locked into fixed rates of 9.75 per cent a week or two back
must now be feeling unhappy.
In the City, the betting seems to be on further falls in mortgage rates. So,
instead of seeking a fixed rate, it looks sensible to try to find a
capped-rate product which will allow your payments to fall in line with the
market.
Birmingham Midshires is offering two two-year mortgages, one capped and one
fixed. They are available for endowment, pension, PEP and re-mortgages,
although there is a ceiling of 75 per cent of the value of the property for
re-mortgages.
The fixed rate is available at 8.90 per cent and the capped rate at 9.20,
with an APR of 10.30 per cent in both cases. There is no compulsory
insurance but there is a Pounds 225 arrangement fee. Early redemption
penalties are three months' interest.
Woolwich, the third-largest society, and Alliance &amp; Leicester, the
fourth-biggest, both are marketing new fixed-rate mortgages. Woolwich is
offering 8.99 per cent (APR 10.1 per cent) fixed for five years for
endowment or pension mortgages only. There is a Pounds 275 application fee
but no compulsory insurance and the early-redemption penalty is three
months.
Alliance &amp; Leicester is offering two mortgages, one at 8.5 per cent, the
other at 8.75 per cent, both for two years. Which rate you get depends on
whether you want a mortgage for more or less than 75 per cent of the
property's value. The loans must be larger than Pounds 30,000. Both are
portable: if you move, you can transfer the mortgage to the new property.
More attractive still is the 8.25 per cent, two-year fixed-rate from
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, with an application fee of Pounds 100. It is
available for all types of mortgage; redemption penalty is three months'
interest.
It is likely, though, that we will see lower rates before much longer from
C&amp;G and the other large societies. Their present fixed rates compare well
with those of the past decade, but they do not look particularly enticing if
you believe that inflation in Britain is going to remain around 3 per cent
or less for the short and medium term future, with base rates also remaining
low.

FT  03 OCT 92 / US economy and job market flat: Bad news in official figures
comes at difficult time for Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy is stagnating and could be on the brink of a fresh
contraction, according to figures released yesterday.
Official figures show the labour market is virtually flat and factory orders
are falling sharply.
The US Federal Reserve yesterday held off any interest rate cut to lift the
sagging economy, although many analysts believe it may act next week.
The latest bad news on the economy comes at a difficult time for Mr George
Bush who is trailing badly in the presidential polls and putting a brave
face on the return to the race of Texas billionaire Mr Ross Perot. The Bush
camp is saying Democratic contender Mr Bill Clinton has more to lose from Mr
Perot's re-entry than the president.
Mr Bush and Mr Clinton agreed this week to face each other in three
televised debates in the run-up to the November 3 poll. Mr Perot is also
expected to take part and is likely to try to focus on the economy.
The Labour Department yesterday reported a 57,000 decline in non-farm
employment last month and sharply revised up its estimate of job losses in
August from 83,000 to 128,000. In a normal recovery, monthly employment
gains of about 200,000 would be expected.
Separate figures showed an unexpectedly sharp 1.9 per cent plunge in new
orders for manufactured goods in August. This was the third decline in four
months and followed a 0.9 per cent fall in July.
The unemployment rate edged down to 7.5 per cent against 7.6 per cent in
August, allowing the Bush administration to claim the economy was improving
slightly. However, the fall in unemployment reflected a shrinkage of the
labour force as discouraged workers abandoned the search for jobs, rather
than increased hiring.
Analysts said the figures - the latest in a series of depressing reports -
indicated the economy was weakening again. Employment fell substantially in
manufacturing and construction. The average working week also declined,
indicating a likely contraction in incomes last month.
Many analysts continue to predict another cut in US interest rates, in spite
of the dollar's weakness. This could occur after a meeting of Fed
policy-makers next week and might involve a half point cut in the discount
rate to 2.5 per cent and a quarter point cut in overnight inter-bank rates
to 2.75 per cent.
'The continued weakness of the economy makes another easing move by the Fed
almost inevitable,' said Mr Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at the Wall Street
bank, J P Morgan.
Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York, forecast
a half point cut in the discount rate and warned there was a risk of
contraction in this quarter after barely positive growth in the third
quarter.
Recent jobs figures have been distorted by a federal summer jobs programme.
Excluding the effects of this, non-farm employment has declined on average
by about 19,000 each month since June. This marks a sharp change from the
second quarter, when employment rose modestly.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Sugar says he may take Amstrad private after losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman and founder of Amstrad, confirmed that he was
considering taking his personal computers and consumer electronics company
private again as it reported a full-year loss for the first time and passed
the final dividend.
Amstrad reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 70.95m, compared with a previous
profit of Pounds 20.16m as it struggled against savage price cutting in the
PC market and shrinking margins in its satellite business.
The results for the year to June 30, which were worse than expected, show
how the Amstrad story, once a stock market sensation, has turned sour.
Mr Sugar has not stated reasons for wanting to re-privatise, but the
consensus in the City is that at the current level the shares look
undervalued. With an estimated 19p of net cash per share, 'the most
compelling reason is that it looks to be a very good deal', one analyst
said.
Taking the company private would also facilitate any further restructuring
and deal-making Mr Sugar might be considering.
Mr Sugar, who is considering an offer to buy, at 30p a share, the shares he
does not already own in the company, was not available for comment
yesterday.
This offer is less than one-seventh the 233p value the shares peaked at in
1988. Yesterday the shares closed up 1p at 25p.
Turnover tumbled more than 30 per cent to Pounds 356.58m from Pounds 528.41m
and the operating loss before exceptional items came to Pounds 39.09m,
compared with an operating profit of Pounds 40.56m.
The PC market, from which it derives about 40 per cent of its revenues, has
become a savage battleground where the industry's leading companies are
engaged in an unprecedented price war and the shelf life of products is now
extremely short.
Satellite sales have also slipped to Pounds 106m from Pounds 147m and the
company has been unable to deliver the innovative mass-market hits which
underpinned its success in the mid-1980s.
Amstrad has not been able to shift products quickly and has been forced to
dispose of outdated merchandise in order to maintain cash liquidity. The
resulting inventory provisions and restructuring costs led to an exceptional
charge of Pounds 31.86m.

FT  03 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With a buy-out bid all but on the table, Mr Alan Sugar certainly has no
incentive to paint a rosy picture of trading conditions at Amstrad. Even so,
shareholders may have found yesterday's decision to pass the final dividend
hard to swallow - all the more so in the light of confirmation that the
group holds net cash balances of some 20p a share. One might reflect whether
a company on the receiving end of a hostile bid would behave in the same
ungenerous manner.
Admittedly the cash position will deteriorate in the run-up to Christmas as
stocks are built. But with sales of just 63p a share last year generated
from net assets of 46p a share, Amstrad still looks heavily
over-capitalised. Surely some of this surplus could be distributed to
shareholders.
As for yesterday's full year figures, they are of scant help in predicting
the trading outlook or assessing the offer. With inventories cleared of
older products, Amstrad may now be able to rebuild margins. Yet there are
signs of tougher conditions in areas such as satellite dishes which have
hitherto been trading profitably. In the meantime the shares are trading at
a discount to both asset value and the likely 30p bid price. The market
holds out little hope of extracting improved terms.

FT  03 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the light of Hongkong Land's opportunistic move to grab a 30 per cent
stake in Trafalgar this week, investors will doubtless be scratching around
for other asset rich companies apparently undervalued by the UK stock
market. It is hard to find targets, though, which are dogged by such a rich
combination of uncertainties. Bids there will be at the first sniff of real
recovery, but it is still much too early for corporate financiers to be
licking their lips.
The tussle for Trafalgar thus looks set to be the more intriguing for being
waged in isolation. But one wonders whether those who sold out to the Far
Eastern raiders on Thursday will not regret their haste. Given the company's
clutch of largely late cycle businesses - and the worrying build-up of debt
 -there is obviously some downside risk. This is surely one reason for Land
to stick with a minority stake for the moment. With boardroom representation
it will presumably have a clearer idea of what it has bought in 12 months'
time. Already, though, one must assume that the Keswicks have a shrewd idea
of the sort of value they can extract. Whether this can be done by
galvanising existing management, injecting new boardroom blood, or
ultimately assuming control via a full takeover is scarcely relevant for
shareholders. All are reasons for sitting tight.
Keen students of Trafalgar, meanwhile, will be looking forward to the role
that results for the year to September will play in the defence. A
temptation must be to limit the dividend cut and take a Barratt-style write
down on housing land, clearing the way for earnings growth next year.

FT  03 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Too reserved by far
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How perfectly silly of the Treasury to come up with September reserve
figures so obviously designed to confuse. There is not much point in seeking
to disguise, after the event, the amount spent to support sterling in the
run-up to Black Wednesday's devaluation. The superficial impression from the
underlying Dollars 7.7bn fall in reserves was that the Bank of England spent
considerably less than the supposedly grudging Bundesbank in defence of the
pound. Nor does it help the gilts market to massage the intervention figure
down. It would simply conclude that less PSBR funding had been tucked away
than previously thought.
The City, however, is far from hoodwinked. It can stick to intervention
estimates of some Pounds 15bn, knowing that the Treasury left itself plenty
of room for obfuscation by not declaring the extent of short-term borrowings
from the Bundesbank. Admittedly, if these are repaid by purchases of D-marks
in the market rather than refinanced with borrowing, the intervention will
no longer count as PSBR funding. That creates considerable uncertainty. More
generally the authorities' obsession with secrecy hardly instils confidence
in future currency management.
The nagging worry that the authorities may actually have something to hide
was probably a psychological factor behind sterling's 4.5 pfennig fall. It
did not help that the Bundesbank left its interest rates unchanged, although
there is a nuance to this disappointment. The German central bank is now
stressing its desire to see money market rates below 9 per cent and
downplaying M3 growth as a monetary indicator. That could be the first
glimmerings of an easier policy. But it will be some time before lower
German rates bring much scope for UK easing. Sterling's weakness suggests
the authorities must be wary of any unilateral cuts.

FT  03 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): September jobs report sparks
heavy selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A MIXED September employment report sparked heavy selling on US stockmarkets
yesterday as investors' hopes for another interest rate cut receded in the
wake of the data, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 53.76 at 3,200.61, at
its lows for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also
ended sharply lower, down 5.82 at 410.47, while the Amex composite finished
down 3.57 at 371.24 and the Nasdaq composite down 6.69 at 571.64. Turnover
on the New York SE was 189m shares.
Although the keenly awaited September employment report was not as bad as
most analysts had been expecting - non-farm payrolls fell 57,000, and not
120,000 as forecast, and the national jobless rate dropped unexpectedly from
7.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent - the market still did not like what it saw.
The details of the figures were not promising, with the average work week
and average hourly earnings both lower last month. Overall, the data
provided little reason to hope for much of a recovery over the rest of the
year. Only an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve could have lifted
the market's gloom, but yesterday's figures were deemed insufficiently
distressing to prompt such a move by the monetary authorities.
Among individual stocks banks fell on disappointment at the lack of an
interest rate cut. BankAmerica slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 7/8 ,
Citicorp dropped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 3/4 , Chemical gave up Dollars
3/4 at Dollars 32, Banc One eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 , and Chase
Manhattan fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22.
K mart fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 1/4 after the giant retailer
announced it would issue convertible preferred stock to finance the
acquisition of Borders, a private book superstore chain. Details on the
value of the deal were not available.
Profits warnings sent several shares tumbling. JWP plunged Dollars 3 1/8 to
Dollars 3 7/8 in turnover of 2.2m shares after the company said it expected
to report a third quarter loss of 50 cents a share, compared with a profit
of 39 cents a share a year ago. Another company warning of a third quarter
loss was Porta Systems, which tumbled Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 11 1/2 on the
American Stock Exchange.
Canada
TORONTO'S composite index dropped 43.97 points, or 1.34%, to end at
3,231.07, 154 down on the week, the lowest level since January 1991. The
gold sector, up slightly, was the only sub-group able to post a gain.
Soaring interest rates meant three-month Canada treasury bills yielded 7.95%
yesterday compared with 5.60% last Friday.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SIXTH consecutive fall left the Nikkei average 5.8 per cent lower on the
week, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei fell 45.84 to the day's low of 17,324.07, after index-linked
buying by investment trusts had lifted it to an afternoon high of 17,573.92.
Volume fell to 240m shares from 329m. Advances narrowly led declines by 517
to 437 with 146 unchanged and the Topix index of all first section stocks
lost 1.29 to 1,303.14. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.88 to
1,040.60.
The market opened firmer on arbitrage buying and bargain hunting by public
fund operators, but fell as the Nikkei futures contract trading on the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange lost ground. Big investors
remained inactive, blaming US economic uncertainty, adding that positions
could not be taken ahead of yesterday's US unemployment figures.
Aids-related issues were higher on speculative buying. Green Cross, the
pharmaceutical company, rose Y60 to Y1,550. Housing issues liked a 12 per
cent rise in housing starts for August. Shokusan Jutaku rose Y43 to Y580 in
active trading, while Misawa Homes advanced Y60 to Y1,070.
High-technology issues were hit by the higher yen. Hitachi lost Y3 to Y727
and Matsushita Electric Industrial declined Y10 to Y1,090. However, NEC
firmed Y10 to Y690 on bargain hunting, rising for the first time in eight
days.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y3 to Y562 on buying by public funds.
Nippon Steel also gained Y2 to Y291.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 163.28 to 18,931.69 in volume of 10.4m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, declined Y40 to Y9,750, investors
wary of its high export ratio and the effects of the higher yen.
Roundup
PACIFIC Region markets were broadly stronger yesterday.
HONG KONG rose on hopes of a cut in domestic interest rates, the Hang Seng
index closing 66.6 higher at 5,595.44, still 1.6 per cent lower on the week,
as turnover improved from HKDollars 1.5bn to HKDollars 2bn.
Hongkong Land closed 80 cents, or 6 per cent lower at HKDollars 13 as its
associate, Jardine Matheson eased 50 cents to HKDollars 50.5, on overseas
selling after Hongkong Land's dawn raid on Britain's Trafalgar House.
AUSTRALIA put interest rate hopes together with news of abandoned share
issues as the All Ordinaries closed 10.9 higher at 1,483.00, a 0.9 per cent
gain on the week. Turnover reached ADollars 200m.
Westpac was down 1 cent at ADollars 2.85 as investors appeared to disregard
Thursday's boardroom resignations.
TAIWAN extended its early gains to close sharply higher. The release on bail
on Thursday's of Oung Ta-ming, head of the Hualon group, also helped lift
sentiment. The weighted index gained 133.63 or 3.7 per cent to 3,717.71, a 7
per cent increase on the week. Turnover was also active, up to TDollars
28.1bn from TDollars 21.6bn.
BANGKOK climbed to a new 17-month high as banks, finance shares and the
major property company, Bangkok Land, jumped in afternoon trade. The SET
index ended 21.03, or 2.45 per cent higher at 880.71, 2.5 per cent higher on
the week, in heavy turnover of Bt19.2bn.
Bangkok Land, the biggest stock in the market, hit its 10 per cent upward
limit, rising Bt13 to Bt145 in turnover of Bt1.67bn.
NEW ZEALAND saw a rise in Fletcher Challenge boost the market. The NZSE-40
index advanced 16.52 to 1,423.43 in turnover of NZDollars 27m. Fletcher
Challenge put on 11 cents to NZDollars 1.94.
MANILA improved on selective buying of blue chips as the composite index
gained 10.43 to 1,428.54, up 2.8 per cent on the week. PLDT gained 15 pesos
to 1,010 pesos.
SEOUL gained momentum in a technical rebound and the composite index climbed
4.36 to 513.12, a gain of 2.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was Won99.9bn
against Thursday's Won82.5bn.

FT  03 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses weaken on German and
US influences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LACK of movement from the Bundesbank, followed by steady US September
jobless data and its implications for US interest rates, left bourses mostly
lower yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fell to a DAX index low of 1,474.25 in the last half hour before
recovering to 1,478.04, 5.99 down on the day and 2.3 per cent down on the
week. German market turnover from DM5.1bn to DM3.5bn.
Strong gains for the dollar on the jobless data were seen initially as
supportive of Germany's cyclical, and export-oriented corporate economy.
Among major exporters the carmaker BMW, for which the US is a key market,
continued to drift upwards, trading at DM477 in after-market computer
business after an official close of DM475, up DM4.
However, dealers were talking more bearishly later, and the run of
depressing economic news continued as the association of German machine and
machine tool wholesalers said that it expected 1992 turnover to fall by 3 to
5 per cent this year.
PARIS was disappointed by the Bundesbank's announcement and Thursday's poor
interim results. The CAC-40 index closed down 40.66 or 2.4 per cent at
1,683.34, a decline of 8.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was moderate at
FFr2.2bn.
Peugeot continued to fall following Thursday's results, and on yesterday's
news that its September sales year-on-year had fallen by 1.9 per cent
against a 4.6 per cent rise from Renault. It slid to a new 1992 low of
FFr495.10, down FFr28.90 or 5.5 per cent.
Eurodisney fell on low September attendance and apparent difficulty in
attracting foreign tourists. Sterling and lira devaluations were reported to
have depressed custom. The shares closed FFr1.60 lower at FFr67.40.
Eurotunnel, which said that it will meet analysts on Monday to present new
revenue forecasts, was FFr1.40 weaker at FFr35.30.
UAP fell FFr17.50 to FFr367.50 on losses at its Banque Worms subsidiary.
Societe Generale lost FFr12 to FFr516 and Axa shed FFr44 to FFr734.
MADRID ended with a slight rise but the general feeling was that a further
devaluation in the peseta, and up to a 1 per cent rise in interest rates,
was imminent. The general index closed 0.27 higher at 186.28, a trend
reflected in the Ibex which at one time had been more than 2 per cent lower.
On the week, the general index was 7 per cent lower, but a significant
feature yesterday was the return of foreign buyers who have been absent over
the last few days.
MILAN mixed the week's disappointing results, from Montedison and EniChem,
with speculation and tax influences. The result were a Comit index 2.17
higher at 365.27, up 1.0 per cent on the week and one or two exciting
individual moves; but there was an underlying feeling that the corporate
sector had more woes to come.
The Fiat group retail and construction companies, Rinascente and Cogefar,
rose 8.3 per cent to L4,050 lire and 10.5 per cent to L1,801 before
temporary suspension. The excitement followed the Fiat statement that it may
sell some non-strategic assets to help finance a heavy car investment
programme.
Tax news included newspaper reports that capital gains tax might be
suspended for six months and, more ominously, the imposition by decree of
the 0.7 per cent tax on corporate net assets and the abolition of local tax
deductibility.
Mr Enrico Ponzone and Ms Fiona Marshall of Kleinwort Benson calculate that
the deductibility abolition will raise the combined corporate tax ratio from
47.8 to 52.2 per cent and that this, with the net assets tax, could impact
company profits next year by as much as 10 to 15 per cent in some cases.
STOCKHOLM lost 2.5 per cent as investors remained worried about the effect
of high short-term interest rates. The Affarsvarlden index closed 17.4 lower
at 681.2, a 2.4 per cent fall on the week. Turnover was weak at SKr350m
against Thursday's SKr446m. Some analysts noted a slight rebound in prices
after the US dollar gained strength following positive economic data.
The bank and finance sector worsened with Handelsbanken's A-restricted
shares losing SKr2.50 to SKr26.50, while in the beseiged forestry sector
Stora's B shares lost SKr12 to SKr186.

FT  03 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Mr Perot muddies election waters once
again - But with a Clinton victory in prospect, Patrick Harverson details a
sector-by-sector investment approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ross Perot has really put the cat among the pigeons now. Just when the stock
markets had not only become used to a two-horse race for the White House,
but were also gradually coming to terms with the prospect of a Democratic
victory, Mr Perot re-entered the race on Thursday.
Mr Perot's re-entry has muddied the electoral waters, and it is much too
early to tell how it might affect the final result. A consensus, however, is
gradually emerging about what a Clinton victory might mean for the equity
markets, and for individual sectors and stocks in particular.
One of the best reviews of the potential impact on stock prices of a
leftward shift in US politics was published this week by New York broking
house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
The report kicks off by predicting that Governor Clinton will win, although
it was compiled before Mr Perot's return to the race. It has no clear
conclusion on what a Clinton administration would mean for the equity market
as a whole - there is, wisely, no prediction of where the Dow would be at
the end of the first year of a Clinton presidency - but the report does
provide some insights into the possible implications for individual sectors.
Auto and related stocks. What the car industry needs is volume, says DLJ,
and Clinton's proposed middle-class tax cuts 'should be just the ticket for
a nice boost in auto demand.' Democratic plans for action on research and
development tax credits are also welcomed. Any urge to increase import
restrictions on foreign cars, however, would not be good in the long run (it
could lead to higher car prices and remove the incentive on US manufacturers
to improve quality); auto executives in Detroit are reportedly very worried
by the thought of an environmental vice president, Al Gore, and do not want
a further tightening of restrictions under the Clean Air Act.
Banks. The introduction by the Democrats of government programmes which lead
to more fiscal stimulus and economic growth would be good for the sector,
but any extension of banking regulation could 'further restrict the US
banking industry from being an efficient financial intermediary, both
domestically and globally.' DLJ also points out that the best possible
environment for US bank stocks is slow, steady, non-inflationary growth,
which is what the US has now. Change, therefore, may not be a good thing.
Financial Services. DLJ anticipates higher inflation and higher long-term
interest rates if the Democrats go ahead with their spending plans. Among
the financial service stocks which have traditionally fared worst in such an
environment are Dreyfus and Kemper, two investment fund groups, American
General, a diversified financial services company, and Sallie Mae, the
student loans provider. Securities brokers have showed the least sensitivity
on this score.
Food and Beverages. Although food and beverage stocks are thought to have
little fundamental exposure to a Democratic administration, higher inflation
and interest rates would lower price-earnings ratios for stable growth
companies in this sector - so be warned, investors in Anheuser-Busch,
Coca-Cola, Campbell Soups, General Mills and Kellogg, to name just a few.
Machinery. Clinton proposes to spend Dollars 200bn on road building,
infrastructure and related programmes over the next four years. He also
wants to increase spending on education by 30 per cent over three years,
with the emphasis on vocational training. The machinery sector has a
shortage of workers with such training. DLJ believes the North American Free
Trade Agreement, vital to the future prosperity of the machinery industry,
will not be altered much by Clinton. Consequently, a Democratic president
would be good for the sector, especially Caterpillar and Ingersoll-Rand.
Retailing. Although the initial burst of Democratic spending would be
positive for retailing, DLJ warns that higher interest rates and inflation
would clamp down on any recovery, and so investors should seek out retailers
with the resources to expand and have lower cost structures: this means
Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Costco, Albertson's and Circuit City.
Healthcare This is the sector that will be most affected by a change of
government. On the positive side, any extension of the health insurance
programmes would stimulate demand for pharmaceuticals and hospital supply
items. On the negative, the Democrats want to control prices on
pharmaceuticals reimbursed by public health schemes.
In fact, earlier this week investors began discounting the implication of
price controls for medical companies' earnings by selling a range of stocks,
including United Healthcare, Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Heart of England members hope for
bonus bonanza - But suitor from Scotland might not have quite enough money
for the dowry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR YEARS, investors have been trying to spot building societies which might
be taken over by outsiders and end up paying substantial cash bonuses to
their members.
Last month, it emerged that Heart of England, the 25th-biggest society with
assets of Pounds 1.01bn, was negotiating with Bank of Edinburgh, a retail
financial services group, about a friendly takeover. Once terms for the deal
are agreed - something which seems still to be some way off - the 200,000
Heart of England members may be in for a bonus which could set a precedent
for the entire industry.
To understand what is at stake, you must remember that this is not like a
takeover between companies. Building societies are owned not by shareholders
but by their members. If a society decides to shed mutual ownership, it can
be done only through a vote by members at an extraordinary general meeting.
The criteria for approval are quite stiff: in a building society flotation,
like that of Abbey National in 1989, 20 per cent of savers had to vote and a
75 per cent vote in favour was required. A simple majority is needed from
borrowers who vote.
When it comes to a takeover, the voting requirements are much higher. At
least half the savers in the target society must vote, and more than
three-quarters of those who do must be in favour of the change.
Alternatively, savers with 90 per cent of the savings held in the society
must vote in favour. It is a stiff test and, until April 1989, no one had
any idea of how easy it would be to get past it.
The resounding vote that month by Abbey National members in favour of
shedding building society status transformed the picture completely. Of the
5.5m members eligible to vote, 3.1m (or 62 per cent) did so, with 89 per
cent of savers and 90 per cent of borrowers in favour of the flotation.
That suggests that the voting hurdle should be easy to exceed. But, of
course, it depends in part on what incentives are offered to members.
Abbey's were offered Pounds 100 worth of free shares, worth Pounds 140 at
the time of the float although they rose rapidly in value once trading
began: this week, they would have been worth Pounds 313.
Since members of a society being taken over are, in effect, giving away
ownership of their shares, it has normally been assumed that they would get
generous cash handouts. So, are Heart of England members in for a bonanza? I
fear not.
Bank of Edinburgh is capitalised at Pounds 26m, and a quick calculation
suggests it cannot pay 200,000 members even Pounds 140 each. Perhaps the
Scottish investors who back it will be willing to put up more cash to
finance the purchase. But their resources are unlikely to be unlimited and,
apart from paying a bonus to Heart of England savers, the bank also needs to
inject new capital into the society and keep some money ready for further
possible acquisitions.
If the investors do not stump up, Bank of Edinburgh might have to consider
mixing some cash for members along with an offer of new shares.
Incidentally, the bank need not hand out the bonus on a flat-rate base: it
could decide to pay investors in proportion to the amount of cash they had
with the society on a qualifying date, and hope to attract the backing of
savers controlling 90 per cent of its funds.
The trouble is that Bank of Edinburgh shares are not at present traded on
the stock exchange. Even if they were, they are a much less attractive
investment than Abbey National shares were in 1988.
It remains to be seen whether savers will vote for this sort of deal which,
frankly, would be a much less glittering offer than that made to Abbey
National members.
Is now the time to put money into the Heart of England? If the takeover date
goes ahead, a qualifying date will be set. It might have passed already, but
not necessarily so. (Abbey National announced its flotation plans in April
1988 and set a qualifying date of December 31 that same year). Members who
were not entitled to vote - children, for example - did particularly well
out of the compensation offered.
Some investors prefer to try to identify the society which will be next in
line for a takeover after Heart of England - not an easy task, because plans
can change. National &amp; Provincial planned a stock market flotation in 1989
but had to pull out.
But societies which might be plausible targets for a takeover include
Norwich &amp; Peterborough, Chelsea, North of England, West Bromwich, Stroud &amp;
Swindon and perhaps the Portman. All combine fairly large branch networks
with strong regional customer bases which might be attractive to a bank.
Even if no predators emerge from outside the industry for them, they would
be natural candidates for mergers with a larger society. If any of them
remains independent in 10 years' time, it will have cause to congratulate
itself.

MY HUSBAND worked in London from 1957 to 1973. He then moved back to Ireland
and died there in 1989. Am I entitled to the English widow's pension?
Your husband would have been required by law to contribute to the UK state
social security system during his period of employment in the UK. To find
out what widow's state pension rights are available, you should write to the
Department of Social Security, Central Pensions Branch, Newcastle upon Tyne
NE98 lYX.
You should quote your husband's UK National Insurance number if you know
this. If not, you should ask the Irish social security authorities if they
can provide any information that will help to trace his UK social security
record.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Bachelor's complaint
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM a lifelong bachelor, aged 53, who has been working for the same
American multinational company since 1964. On joining the company, I had to
join the contributory pension scheme, which is contracted-out of Serps. It
is a final salary scheme, and contributions are based solely on present
salary.
But I am concerned that the scheme discriminates against single employees in
two ways: first, they do not have the right to (or need) a widow's pension;
second, in calculating retiring pensionable pay on which benefits are based,
the married basic state retirement pension is subtracted from pensionable
earnings. This means, effectively, that the benefits per Pounds of
contributions are worth less for single than for married employees.
Is this kind of discrimination legal? If not, how should I go about seeking
redress? I intend retiring in 4/5 years from now.
We do not accept your contention that your pension scheme 'discriminates'
against single people.
The notion that any benefit provided by an employer for one employee which
cannot be (or is not) provided for another somehow 'discriminates' is
totally wrong-headed. Many schemes provide orphans' benefits and no one
refers to them as 'discriminating' against employees without children.
The objective of an employer with a good final paid pension plan is usually
to ensure a guaranteed level of income replacement for employees who retire
after reasonable periods of service, and also for spouses and other
dependents.
Marriage patterns are unpredictable. Many employees who have remained single
throughout their careers have married only a few months before retirement,
enabling this late marriage partner to qualify for the same post-retirement
spouse's pension entitlement as if the employee had been married throughout
his service.
The employer might well fund his pension scheme on the assumption that
virtually all employees will marry or have a dependant who will qualify for
the equivalent of a spouse's pension. Furthermore, an increasing number of
schemes now provide surviving spouse's pensions for post-retirement
marriages.
This pattern of pension provision has been, and is, treated normally as
equitable. Arguments such as those which you advance about discrimination
against bachelors tend to be treated as on a par with claims by bachelors
and childless couples that they should pay lower taxes because they have no
children to use the state education system.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Overcharged by the Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I SOLD a second home and provided the Inland Revenue with the necessary
information for CGT purposes. In February 1992 they charged me an interim
amount of tax, and in March 1992 they charged another final amount.
I paid each of these soon after receiving their requests. Recently, they
have told me I was considerably overcharged. Should I expect (or is it the
duty of) the Revenue to pay interest to me on the overpaid sums?
Much depends upon whether the error was a simple mistake or whether it might
reasonably be ascribed to incompetence or maladministration. It is possible,
for example, that the error was partly attributable to the manner in which
you set out the relevant facts, figures and dates. And you must bear in mind
that you were under a statutory obligation to submit your own computation of
the chargeable gain (by virtue of section 12 of the Taxes Management Act
1970).
In order to keep down the cost of tax collection, parliament requires
taxpayers to calculate their chargeable gains: you had no legal right simply
to provide the tax inspector with the basic data and leave him to work out
the chargeable gain. It is a pity you did not think of seeking guidance on
the CGT rules from the solicitor who acted for you in the sale of the house.
Had you done so, it might have been possible for him to advise you on a way
of reducing the prospective CGT bill.
You might like to come back to us with the precise facts, figures and dates
which you sent to the tax office so that we can calculate what the
chargeable gain should be. At the same time you could, if you wish, send us
photocopies of the tax office's calculations etc.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Sad decline of the building societies
 -Diary of a Private Investor / They're getting the banks' bad habits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IN 1990, my family of four
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
two adults, two children - had 15 separate accounts with seven different
building societies. Recently, however, we have cut back.
One of the reasons we had spread our money so widely was that I believed the
UK was 'over-branched' with societies and that, with a decline in the
housing market and a difficult economic situation, more of them would have
to merge.
If that occurred, we might hope to benefit from 'bonuses' paid by societies
to members to encourage them to vote for such mergers.
(This happened in 1990 when, as members of the Portman building society, we
received a bonus of 4 per cent on our investments (with a Pounds 100 bonus
limit for each account) when it merged with the Regency and West of
England).
We also thought that several societies would follow Abbey National and gain
a stock market quotation, with shares being given to members.
In the present recession, though, I feel some societies will be forced into
mergers or could be taken over by other financial institutions; in such
circumstances, relatively little may be offered as a bonus payment to
members.
And if they vote against a merger or takeover, their society might have
rather a difficult future.
It is also worth remembering that building society investors are protected
for only the first 90 per cent of their deposits, up to Pounds 20,000 for
each individual per society.
With the recent flop or withdrawal of several company flotations and
continuing uncertainty over the stock market, it could well be that any
society that had considered a flotation will defer such plans for a few
years. There are still, however, a number of small societies which ought to
attract bonus payments if they are taken over. These are the ones which have
not diversified into loss-making activities like estate agents, and which
have a high free capital ratio.
Take the Lambeth (with which I am retaining an account). While many
societies have a free capital ratio of less than 6 per cent, it reported a
free capital ratio of 9.61 per cent for the year ended January 31 1992.
Of course, takeover terms for societies will depend heavily on their loan
policies. Have they granted too many 90-100 per cent mortgages where the
value of the property is now considerably less than the outstanding loan and
many people are finding it hard to meet payments? Have they taken adequately
into account the likelihood of further falls in property prices? Do their
accounts reflect problem loans properly?
The societies complained bitterly recently about competition from various
National Savings products; this led to a reduction in the interest rates
offered on some of them. But the societies also face increasing competition
from banks and other institutions.
Some years ago, there was a marked difference between banks and societies.
The banks generally were overstaffed (although people had to queue for
service) and they made a series of bad loans to third world countries,
failed property companies and crooked businessmen.
By contrast, societies appeared keen and efficient. There were seldom long
queues in their branches and they made comparatively few bad loans  -
although all were secured on property.
Now, some societies send out a torrent of unsolicited junk mail offering
people loans for all sorts of purposes. Some have been involved with failed
property companies, some are increasing their overseas lending and, somehow,
queues are starting to appear in branches. There are, of course, many
excellent societies, but I fear some are becoming more like the banks of a
few years ago.
While some banks now are striving for greater efficiency and better service,
it seems remarkable that, despite the recession, the number of society staff
actually has increased - despite the number of new mortgages granted being
considerably less than in, say, 1988 - while standards of service appear to
have diminished.
Many co-owners of societies (their depositors) are unaware of these staff
increases. This is because most societies do not send their shareholder
depositors a full set of accounts. Instead, they receive rather scrappy
'summary financial statements.'
In general, these omit to mention the salaries paid to directors. Indeed,
many societies appear to be run by self-perpetuating boards. But these could
well need a shake-up; a board that managed in easier economic times might
not be suited to the tougher climate now.
As well as competition for depositors and mortgage advances from the banks,
I think the societies also will face growing competition from foreign
currency funds. The recent turmoil within the EC has shown how nice profits
can be made from foreign currency transactions.
As it is easier to switch currencies with banks than with building societies
 -especially if people want to back something exotic like the Korean won -
will the societies find some of their large depositors turning elsewhere?

FT  03 OCT 92 / Private View: Philosopher at the farm gate - Wendell Berry
is suspicious of modern environmentalists who oversimplify, sloganise and
are ready to compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW GRATIFYING to meet a man who looks so much the part. Lean and leathery,
over 6ft tall, with close-set eyes, a slow manner and an authentic drawl,
Wendell Berry is every inch the city bumpkin's idea of a Kentucky farmer.
Berry could have stepped from a Norman Rockwell painting. But his homespun
exterior belies a vigorous mind: he is a lecturer, poet and polemicist who
inveighs against the rape of Nature by Man in prose that thumps as
remorselessly as a die-stamping machine.
I asked him if he was a hillbilly.
Berry bristled, then decided not to take offence. 'Well, some people would
call me a hillbilly. It's a term like 'nigger', not famous yet as an insult
but it's a term of denigration. It's used to denigrate country people and
people who do fundamental work.'
He was reared on a farm in Henry County, a tobacco-growing area of Kentucky,
but Berry is less a farmer who writes than a writer who farms. Are you a
gentleman farmer?
'No. Because I don't hire my work. I do it myself - and my wife. Or we swap
work with neighbours.'
For years more quoted than read in his own country, and little known outside
it, Wendell Berry has been described as the best nature writer since Henry
David Thoreau. His message, delivered with Old Testament certitude, is that
man must learn to live according to nature's rules or destroy himself. He
lives as much as he can without energy-consuming gadgets.
I referred to his latest essays and said: You're pretty tough on the rest of
us.
'No, I'm tough on myself. There is no self-righteousness in that book. The
issue is how to think about a national way of life that is wasteful  - one I
participate in just as avowedly in some respects as anyone else. I fly on
airplanes. I drive an automobile. I'm hooked up to the utilities. I'm far
from exempt from the evils I am talking about.'
For fuel he burns wood from his 125-acre farm at Port Royal (pop. 130) on
the Kentucky River, but uses a chainsaw to cut it. He has 15 acres of
arable, grows vegetables, keeps a few cows and ewes and sells lambs in
spring. He has no television. He works with horses and writes with a pencil.
'It's not that I'd rule out any particular piece of equipment,' he
explained. 'It is that I would change the kind of consciousness that uses
the equipment and the standards by which it is used.'
Are you a Luddite?
'I wouldn't give priority to technical advance any more than I would to
someone's profit or to the raw ambition of productivity. I understand why
the original Luddites destroyed the weaving frame: they did it to defend
their communities, and I would do the same, unhesitatingly . . . especially
if I could get away with it.' He laughed.
Wouldn't people go bankrupt if they followed your principles?
'No, that isn't true. My farm is not exemplary. There are many Amish farms
of 80 to 125 acres on which a decent living is made.'
You're not suggesting everyone should live like the Amish.
'No, I'm not suggesting anyone live any particular way. I'm suggesting that
people have a responsibility to take care of the things they use, either
directly or by proxy.'
Berry talks calmly but writes savagely - about corporate underlings, the
medical industry, 'industrial eating', (whose logical fulfilment would be a
tube connecting our stomachs to the factory) and 'industrial sex' (a crude
tally of couplings and orgasms).
He grew up a Baptist and hereditary Democrat, cutting his dialectical teeth
in arguments with his father, a lawyer-farmer. He goes to church but is a
heterodox Christian. He cannot wait to vote against George Bush in next
month's presidential election.
Why?
'Because he's given the country away.' The drawling voice rose angrily. 'He
and Ronald Reagan have collaborated to give the country away to the rich.'
I tried hanging some labels on him. Aren't you simply nostalgic?
'I'm always accused of turning back the clock. You wouldn't tell an addict
that he couldn't turn back the clock because health is somewhere behind him.
What I'm talking about is the possible correction of potentially disastrous
processes.'
Aren't you out of date? Everyone's going green.
'That is not true. The industrialists will do nothing that they are not made
to do. It was true in eastern Kentucky from the time the railroad first went
in there and the coal started comin' out. And it's still true.'
Americans don't surely still believe God created them to shop?
'Have you been to a mall lately? A lot of people in my country virtually
live in malls.'
Are you anthropomorphising Nature?
'No. If Nature could be anthropomorphised there'd be no need to worry about
our relationship with it. Our economy never is going to resemble it exactly.
But enterprises that can be located no place but in nature must resemble
nature in certain ways. That is to say, we must not waste, we must return to
the soil the things we take from it . . .'
. . . for our own benefit?
'Yes. Oh, absolutely.'
Are you really a sort of socialist?
Berry paused. 'I am fundamentally, I think, a kind of Jeffersonian Democrat.
That is, I believe in putting small ownership of usable properties ahead of
the interests of capital. I don't think that the behaviour of money in large
piles ought to be permitted to destroy the security of small livelihoods.
I'm highly sceptical of government solutions on the one hand and I'm highly
sceptical of the claims of the capitalists on the other.'
Unprompted, he added: 'I've been accused of being a Communist also. I've
been accused of the whole political spectrum. I think the problem is I'm
some kind of anomaly.'
Berry is suspicious of modern environmentalists who oversimplify, sloganise
and are ready to compromise. 'When I write, I'm obedient not to the demands
of any side, but to my own sense of what is required in this never-ending,
never altogether satisfactory, effort to tell the truth.'
What about the so-called holistic view of the world?
''Holistic' is a word I won't use, because it's gotten to be one of those
slogan words. It's always seemed to me a word that compromises between
disdain of a plain word like 'whole' and fear of a forthright word like
'holy'.
'I try strenuously to avoid words like 'sustainable' and 'organic'. When I
talk about agriculture I usually say 'good', knowing, for instance, that
there are good farms that may use a little herbicide.'
Berry insists that modern economic nostrums are just plain wrong. We argued
about the benefits of competition, of free trade, of international
comparative advantage, of agricultural subsidies. Each time he returned to
his motif: the imperative need to defend rural communities.
When I suggested his protectionism was the sign of a redneck, he was angry.
'If you said that in a certain tone of voice, I'd sure as hell resent it.'
It's the classic complaint of the small producer, I explained.
'I'd have to go back and ask you what is cheap about permitting a whole
productive class of people to be destroyed? What is cheap about creating a
national dependence on long-distance transport? What would be cheap, if that
transport failed, about retraining those people to make those goods again?'
Are you saying we should all live like you?
'Heaven forbid. Anyone who understands farming would be aghast at the idea
of a lot of city people rushing into the country to farm. It would be like a
mass movement to play the violin. What I'm arguing for is that we should
conduct our economic life by a juster and more complicated standard, the
health of the local ecosystem and the local community.'
Nations should be reconstituted as collections of local economies. Towns and
their surrounding countryside would exchange contracts for food, goods and
services. Governments would be there to guarantee community freedoms.
You say we can't seize Eden by assault. But isn't it you that's looking for
the Garden of Eden?
'Well, I understand what the Fall is about, and I'm only trying to think in
a way that is appropriate to a fallen human being. If we understand human
fallibility and what science has told us about the unpredictability of the
world, about small causes having devastating effects, then the message to me
is: limit the size of your causes.'
What is economic growth for?
'We're not talking about the fulfilment of needs. We're talking about the
fulfilment of created needs. People in the western world tend to have more
clothes than they need, more communications than they need, to eat more than
they need. You have to distinguish between growth that's necessary and
growth that's frivolous.'
You're begging the question who decides what our needs are.
'Sure. But it's also a question of what we are taught to think of ourselves.
Human mental needs are infinitely expandable, but you can eat only so much.'
Your last book is called What Are People For? Have you an answer?
'There are many answers. People are certainly not just to be used by other
people as labour or as soldiery or as consumers or as objects of desire.
They're also for each others' enlightenment, for each others' pleasure. They
are meant to take care of one another. So there would be many answers. My
effort would be to keep there from being too few.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / Truth of the Matter: The quality of mercy - Hugh Dickinson,
Dean of Salisbury, considers the call for mercy killings following a
doctor's conviction for giving an elderly patient a fatal injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT PRICE the tyranny of the abstract noun? I met the phrase for the first
time recently and recognised its face at once. Abstract nouns get canonised.
They get put in manifestos and men and women - though fewer women I suspect
 -proceed to shed their life blood, and other people's, in defence of them.
Meanwhile reality has moved on and the abstraction is beached like some
beautiful empty shell after the tide has ebbed.
Is 'The Sanctity of Life' one such? Or more emphatically, 'The Absolute
Sanctity of Life'? My mother's family were farmers in South Africa and
somewhere in the family folklore there is a story of a young man and his
best friend riding out into the bush to shoot game. Some 20 miles from home
they encounter and wound a lion. But the friend is thrown from his horse and
terribly mauled by the wounded beast. His injuries were appalling and
agonising. Obviously he cannot survive the long rough journey home.
To leave him and ride for help is to abandon him to the lions. To stay with
him only a prolongation of his terrible pain. The only kindly solution is
quick and merciful oblivion. The bullet in the back of the head was his only
option and so he shot his friend.
Most Christian moral theologians would agree. In spite of much loud advocacy
from Christian protest groups, I do not find the Absolute Sanctity of Life
written anywhere in scripture or tradition. 'Thou shalt not kill' means 'no
murder'. But killing abounds in the Old Testament. The long held concept of
The Just War has a respectable place in Christian moral theology, and was
much in play in the months leading up the Gulf War.
So the Sanctity of Life seems easily suspended when more urgent interests
supervene. There are more than 100,000 Iraqi corpses, (mostly unlettered
peasants) in the desert sands following the Gulf War - but then a good deal
of holy oil got spilt as well. For, whatever we may say, most of us,
governments and terrorists alike, believe and act on the belief that there
are a good many other things further up the sanctity scale than human life.
Other abstract nouns, no doubt.
But when I come to lie in mortal pain, I don't want any abstract noun
standing between me and merciful oblivion. I have had enough experience of
pain in my 60 years inside this creaky body to be sure of that, but I
certainly do not want to put my doctor in the postion of having to break the
most solemn oath of his profession, to save life not to take it. He must not
cross that boundary.
There has been much comment in the press about the case of Dr Alan Cox,
tried and convicted in Winchester Crown Court for the attempted murder of a
patient. The moral and practical issues are immensely complex and confusing
and not much helped by abstract nouns. Public debate is essential for I have
no doubt that the pressure for some form of legal euthanasia will become
irresistible in the next 50 years. If we are to go that way we must get it
right.
Clearly the Winchester jury was right in law. Dr Cox intended to kill. He
was therefore guilty. But mens rea (guilty intent) is a slippery fish. The
doctor's choice of drug was not a painkiller but a heart stopper. A bullet
would have had the same purposes and effect. He chose to end the pain by
ending the life. But his intention was not malign, it was benign.
If 'Always do unto others what you would have them do unto you' is the
greatest moral precept of human relationships then it could be said he was
doing the same final act of loving service that his friend did for the young
man mauled by the lion. I would hope so to be loved myself in such a case.
Should we say then a friend may do it but a doctor may not - even to end
intolerable pain?
Moral philosophers have a useful concept of 'double effect'. In this case we
have two effects: pain killing and life killing. It is morally acceptable
for a doctor to administer a drug to kill pain even if the immediate or
longer-term consequence is the death of the patient. It is morally
unacceptable for a doctor to administer a life-killing drug as a way of
ending pain. A + B is alright, B + A is not. It is a subtle line, you may
think, between 'kill to end the pain' and 'kill the pain and so end the
life', but it is one on which their solemn oath and our essential trust in
our doctors stands or falls. It is too dangerous to allow mercy killing to
go on sub rosa amid a kindly conspiracy of silence among the medics.
The conclusion I draw from this, though with some trepidation, is not that
euthanasia in such circumstances must be always banned. It is rather that
the burden of this decision must not be left to doctors. The vast majority
of cases will continue to fall on the acceptable side of the line, and will
offer patients the benign exit through pain killing drugs: but these
exceptional cases will have to be held by the community through appropriate
panels in partnership with the best medical advice. Death is not a medical
responsibility. It belongs to all of us.
The case of excessive pain is not the only one that will come to claim the
panel's attention. There is a continuum through irreversible coma,
Alzheimer's, to premature senile dementia and on to mental handicap and
inconvenient old age. This is the dreaded slippery slope. But the social
pressure to move on to that slope is already irresistible. Many doctors are
standing at its upper edge. Legal enforceable guidelines or legally
constituted panels are the only bulwark against the slide.
The ethical problem in these cases is rather different but if we do not
address it and find an acceptable legal protection for it I believe we will
find people taking their own lives and the lives of their dear ones into
their own hands. Less benign agencies may follow.
What totalitarian regimes or venal doctors might get up to once the wall is
breached is certainly frightening but I do not think they will be deterred
more in the future than they have been in the past by us shouting the
Sanctity of Life into their unheeding ears. Tight legislation will do more
to save life and provide easeful death than any abstract nouns.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Cracking the Tory code: Dominic Lawson interprets a most
un-European language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the more diverting aspects of the deepening political split in the
Conservative Party is, as always within that organisation, the code. He who
wins the battle of terminology will usually win the political war.
At an earlier stage in the debate the semantic initiative was entirely with
those within the party who favour European political and economic union.
They managed to get themselves described by the media as 'pro-European' so
that their opponents were, naturally enough, designated 'anti-European'.
This gave the federalists the initiative: to be called anti-European is to
suggest that one actually dislikes, en masse, the people who live in Europe;
in terms of political correctness it is only one step up from being called
racist.
I do not know which member of the Bruges group invented the phrase
'Eurosceptic', or when, but it saved the day for the Thatcherites. To be
sceptical is to be intelligent in a thoughtful, Tory sort of way. And the
adoption of the term by the press has meant that the opposing faction has
come more and more to be labelled 'Europhile'. This sounds dangerously
foreign, with a slight whiff of perversion.
It would not be the the first time that the right wing of the Conservative
party has won the war of terminology. In the 1980s the division was defined
as being between the wets and the drys. Certain dissenting cabinet ministers
were described as being 'so wet you could shoot snipe off them.' The
anti-Thatcherites never really recovered from the adoption of this
particular code: no politician can for long survive being described as
'wet', and indeed, few did.
In the European debate the rhetorical battle is by no means over. The
federalists still have their famous European 'train', the train which we
must not miss, the train we must be in the van of, the train which must not
be derailed, nor hit the buffers, nor pull into the sidings.
When the opponents of the Maastricht treaty manage to co-opt an image as
simple and appealing (and misleading) as the benevolent train they will
finally have gained the ascendancy in the great debate.
But none of this explains the great mystery of why so many otherwise able
politicians have become so emotionally attached to the idea of being, as
they put it 'at the heart of Europe.'
I have a sneaking suspicion that it all stems from holidays. Europe means
sun, good food and beautiful dark-haired women. It means not having to
commute to the office, it means being liberated from the petty day to day
problems of earning a living in a damp and rainy climate. This for the
middle classes - which describes most conservative MPs - is what Europe
means.
But how many of them, I wonder, choose to spend their holidays in Germany?
Perhaps the anti-federalists should begin to spread the idea that European
union will be like having to spend one holiday a year in Germany. For there
is no doubt that the recent fracas between Britain and Germany has been all
to the benefit of the opponents of the Maastricht treaty, not because there
has been a row - lovers always have those - but because the row has been
with the Germans.
While newspapers such as the Sun have attempted to stir up a popular
campaign against Jacques Delors, it has not really taken hold. The fact is
that the English cannot take the French seriously: this may be a hopelessly
arrogant attitude but it is undeniably a fact: perhaps Napoleon died too
many years ago. But one only has to imagine how British people would react
if Jacques Delors were a German to see how the debate could turn. No wonder
then that John Major was so furious at the publication, through the
Financial Times as it happens, of the Bundesbank President's strictures
about Britain's conduct during the recent debacle on the currency markets.
John Major, while devoted to the cause of European integration, understands
only too well that if the language of the European political debate begins
to be expressed in terms of Anglo - German conflict, then, in Britain at
least, the Maastricht treaty is dead.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Not so secret service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I READ recently that the Russian security ministry, successor to the KGB,
had been miffed that Anatoli Sobchak, the livewire mayor of St Petersburg,
had offered Barbara Hay, the new British consul-general to that city,
elegant quarters near the town hall in which to carry out her duties.
Local security chiefs claimed that cables carrying government information
from the town hall ran under the building in which Ms Hay was to be
ensconced. Andrei Korodkhov, the ministry's liaison officer, said that a
precedent 'will have been set for the British intelligence service to secure
access to classified information using various technical means and devices.
This would not be a healthy development.'
Anxious to have Ms Hay bedded down in her new quarters with minimum
additional fuss, I rang Andrei this week and told him that if he would lay
off Ms Hay, I would make it worth his while by radioing him, each week, a
wad of intelligence news from London to offset any titbits Ms Hay may glean
by plugging, accidentally, perhaps while digging the garden, into the
security cables beneath her building.
'It won't always be classified information,' I told Andrei. 'But the items I
send may go some way to balancing the flow of intelligence data between our
countries.'
First I worked out a code, using a British Rail timetable and encrypting my
transmissions in five-digit numerical groups transformed - using false
addition (2 + 3 = 0) - by a second encryption. As a result, my first
transmission to St Petersburg started '91207 49537 73482 10504 . . .' At the
other end, in a smoke-filled basement, my bulletin would have been decoded
like this:
PRIME MINISTER JOHN MAJOR AND CHANCELLOR NORMAN LAMONT ARE ON THE VERGE OF
BEING LAUGHED OUT OF OFFICE AFTER OPPOSITION LEADER JOHN SMITH DUBBED THEM
THE LAUREL AND HARDY OF BRITISH POLITICS. DO YOU GET LAUREL AND HARDY MOVIES
IN RUSSIA? IF SO, YOU WILL REALISE HOW WOUNDED MAJOR AND LAMONT MUST BE.
TERMINALLY, ONE IMAGINES. LAMONT EXPECTED TO TOPPLE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, MAJOR
BY MID-'93, UNLESS ENGLAND CRICKET TEAM VICTORIOUS IN INDIA THIS WINTER, IN
WHICH CASE DISREGARD MID-'93 FORECAST AND SUBSTITUTE LATE-'93.
There was more in like vein, some of it quite perceptive. Then I sent off a
bit about plans to disband the British Army's German-based 1st British Corp
and merge it into a 12-nation, rapid-reaction force to be known as the
Allied Command Rapid Reaction Corps:
AS WELL AS SUPPLYING THE CORPS COMMANDER AND 30,000 TROOPS, BRITAIN IS
PROVIDING A MAJOR GENERAL AS CHIEF OF STAFF - WIDELY TIPPED AS MAJOR GENERAL
THOMAS WILLIAM HENRY STUART HAROLD KEITH D'ARCY D'AVIGDOR DE FONTAINE DE
BATH AND WELLS, BEST KNOWN IN MILITARY CIRCLES FOR HIS PROPOSAL TO ERECT A
CIRCLE OF EARTH FORTS AROUND LONDON TO COUNTER ATTACKS AGAINST THE MONARCHY.
Mention of the monarchy reminded me that I ought to update St Petersburg on
the Queen's state of mind as she prepares to fill in her first income tax
form:
QUEEN ELIZABETH II'S GLUM MOOD CANNOT HAVE BEEN HELPED BY NEWS FROM AMERICA
ABOUT THE SCREENING OF THE MADE-FOR-TV FILM, FERGIE AND ANDREW: BEHIND THE
PALACE DOORS. ACCORDING TO ONE NEWSPAPER: 'PRINCE ANDREW APPEARS TO HAVE
BRAIN-DAMAGE. 'ONE FEELS SIX MILES TALLER WHEN ONE IS AT SEA,' HE SAYS.'
Finally, I sent this snippet:
SIR MICHAEL CHECKLAND, DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE BBC, NOW RECKONS THE
CORPORATION'S DEFICIT IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR WILL BE Pounds 3.75BN,
DUE TO 'FLAWS IN THE FINANCIAL ALLOCATION PROCESS' AND 'COMPUTER ERROR.' 'IF
IT HADN'T BEEN FOR RUTHLESS SACKINGS,' SAID SIR MIKE, 'THE DEFICIT WOULD
HAVE BEEN Pounds 27.5BN AND RISING.'
I informed St Petersburg that any diminution in the output of intelligence
data from the BBC would be countered by increased output from my own
transmitter.
Next week: results of Hawks &amp; Handsaws' Little Rays of Light Across the
Planet's Doomed and Pitted Surface competition. Entries were still flooding
in last night.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: Badly handled science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE times when the Royal National Theatre seems like one of those old
east European state enterprises where nothing matters except meeting the
production targets. The product may be faulty, some of the people concerned
must know that it is faulty, but there is no way of stopping it once it is
in the system. No-one stands back and says 'look, we are inviting a paying
audience to enjoy itself; this won't do.' Perhaps the actors are too
frightened to protest.
That is the charitable way of looking at Tony Harrison's Square Rounds,
which opened at the Olivier on Thursday. A more unkind thought occurs:
possibly the cast and directors are so involved in the performance that it
does not occur to them to detach themselves and reflect on how awful it
might look to the observer.
To be fair to Harrison, he does not describe Square Rounds as a play but
rather as a 'new theatre piece'. It is unclear what that means except as an
excuse for having no characters, no drama, no pathos, no jokes and no plot.
Square Rounds is about chemical weapons and the old truism that while
science can be a force for good, it can also be a force for ill. Nothing
wrong with that as a theme; it is the way of handling it that matters.
After about the first two hours, I was preparing to write that nothing is as
bad again as the first 20 minutes. That, however, is to reckon without the
last 20. The piece opens with the Kaiser's scientists confronting the
British over nitrogen and fertilisers: apparently the Brits had the wrong
approach to defecation. The opening is scatological all the way. A huge,
though mercifully curtained, WC occupies the centre of the stage.
Then there is a twist. German scientists demonstrate their superiority by
speaking in verse, and it is in verse that the piece proceeds. This is a
reference to the German, Fritz Haber, who was a prolific versifier and is
here shown developing chemical weapons. There is another slight twist in
that practically all the characters are played by women, including about 20
'munitionettes'. A programme note lists 19 military inventions patented by
women during the First World War, among them the cartridge tube filter, the
incendiary ball and the single trigger mechanism, though what we are
supposed to read into that is anybody's guess.
There is one pleasure along the way. Sometimes the women break into song.
The music by Dominic Muldowney is consistently good and there is some
wonderful keyboard playing directed by Helen Ireland. Ignore the words and
concentrate on the sound.
The moral throughout seems to be that one weapons invention leads to
another. Finally we abandon Anglo-German rivalry and move to China where
they invented everything first. I found these last scenes racially
offensive. The Chinamen (sic) are quite grotesquely parodied with silly
grins and silly walks. A sample of the verse is: 'Yes, we learned how to
fling what we call jen ching/ And with a bamboo bazooka hurled/ What is
plain shit to you (and human shit too)/ The first toxic bomb in the world.'
The production is sponsored by KPMG Management Consulting. Sara Kestelman
plays Fritz Haber while not being a munitionette. Harrison himself directs
what can be only described as a regrettable anachronism.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: An invitation to loiter with intent - Patricia Morison
talks to Neil MacGregor, director of London's National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST there remains one issue on which the Germans look to Britain for
advice. Three years after reunification, the future of Berlin's museums is
still being bitterly debated. Key speaker at a recent conference in Berlin
was Neil MacGregor, director of London's National Gallery.
MacGregor explained to the Financial Times his belief that the same
fundamental question now confronts those in charge of great public
art-collections, whether in Berlin or Buenos Aires. 'What kind of
relationship is possible between the public and their collections?'
'In most European countries, there has been a fundamental shift from
providing for the local public to the international tourist'. MacGregor's
strongly held view is that this is a betrayal, tantamount to whoring after
false gods. Great collections which were in so many cases creations of the
19th century to benefit the local citizenry, should not at the end of the
20th century degenerate into 'revenue earners from tourists.'
MacGregor instances the Uffizi Gallery and the Pitti Palace in Florence as
two museums which are now shrines to international tourism. Every visitor
pays a L10,000 entry fee irrespective of whether they are students or
residents. 'Effectively, and allowing for hyperbole, Florence has been
expropriated. Those collections could quite as well be anywhere else.'
MacGregor is almost as critical of developments in Paris where he sees the
Musee d'Orsay and the Louvre as 'supreme examples of museums adapted to an
international public'. The public for which they cater is the average
tourist with only three days in hand. As in all tourist museums, the
emphasis is on fast 'through-put' - and high expenditure.
At the Orsay, the former railway station now the museum of the 19th century,
a parcours keeps the typical visitor running smoothly along the rails from
circa 1800 to 1900. MacGregor sees poor labelling and lack of additional
sources of information at the Uffizi, the Louvre and Rijksmuseum, as further
proof of a stratagem aimed principally at 'a world public'.
An opposite philosophy governs at the National Gallery. 'We set out to
privilege the local population, which is to say, the frequent visitor.' The
ideal visitor is the loiterer with intent, obedient to the MacGregor scheme
of making visitors slow down, sit rather than walk - and to come back.
The hang of the pictures is more spacious than in most continental museums;
labels have become markedly more fulsome. A policy of small, popular
exhibitions in the 'Paintings in Focus' and 'Brief Encounters' series has
proved extraordinarily popular and is being copied by museums abroad.
Then there is all the back-up available to the inquisitive visitor. Computer
terminals in the Sainsbury Wing's Micro Gallery 'make the wilder shores of
mythology and iconography accessible'. There is a free monthly News Letter,
free daily lunchtime lectures, evening debates, and weekend study-days.
Warders are invited to early morning art-history talks to keep them mentally
on their toes.
Central to MacGregor's concept of the Gallery's public is his resolute
opposition to entry-charges. Interestingly, MacGregor and his trustees have
also rejected the idea of introducing charges via the back-door by creating
a 'Friends' organisation, the marketting ploy now so popular even with
non-charging museums such as the British Museum and the Tate. MacGregor may
talk of 'privileging' the locals but eschews talk which smacks any more
strongly of elitism.
But there must always be a question whether the NG is, even so, really
user-friendly? Ironically, in this month's Gallery newsletter playwright
Alan Bennett uses an invitation to enthuse about a painting (Mantegna's
Agony in the Garden) to rehearse his doubts about the foot-aching experience
of gallery-going.
'In a museum I am informed and instructed. But with art . . . I don't know.
What am I supposed to think? What am I supposed to feel?' These are lines
spoken by Chubb, the MI5 man in Bennet's play, A Question of Attribution.
How would MacGregor reassure the curious yet aesthetically insecure Chubbs
among his public?
Give the pictures time, is his key advice to the naive visitor whom he likes
to imagine strolling unhurriedly through the galleries and then, arrested by
a picture, sitting down to look - or to draw, a process he particularly
recommends to parents introducing children to the collection.
MacGregor quotes a favourite passage in Iris Murdoch's The Bell, in which a
character feeling wretched goes to the Gallery for the thousandth time.
Walking past familiar pictures 'as through a well-loved grove' Dora feels
calm descending on her. She looks pityingly at visitors peering at
masterpieces, guidebook in hand. 'Dora did not need to peer. She could look,
as one can at last when one knows a great thing very well, confronting it
with a dignity which it has itself conferred.'
MacGregor's deeply-held belief is that 'the pictures at Trafalgar Square are
of such quality that they will speak, and say something which matters, if
given time. Saturated as we are by the moving image, it has to be a
conscious effort to look at, to relax into, one image for minutes at a time.
MacGregor again refers admiringly to the 19th century, when museums were
intended to change visitors.
'There's no point in reading Shakespeare's sonnets without bringing to it
your own experience of love and rejection. It's just the same with Titian's
'Bacchus and Ariadne', as most people realise if you sit them down to look.'
Great art will speak, even change the viewer, if he or she has the
confidence to bring to it their own emotional experience.
'The dignity of the thing can be taken on by the looker. People take
themselves seriously when they look at something of supreme quality. That, I
think, is the key job of the reactionary art gallery - or traditional, if
you prefer. All museums are the product of the Enlightenment. The end of
enlightenment is a L10,000 fee at the Uffizi.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: Lure of the wanderlust movie - The jungle fever to
which many directors are happy to succomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT USED to be confined to mad dogs and Englishmen. But the 20th century has
evolved and so has the art of baring oneself to the elements in far-off
climes. Along with other follies once associated with Victorian exploration
or safari tourism - shooting rapids, braving monsoons, eyeballing wild
animals - going to distant places to seek inspiration or romantic agony has
become a cinematic speciality.
From the South America of Aguirre, Wrath Of God and The Mission to the
Philippines-as-Vietnam of Apocalypse Now, film productions shot in
inhospitable locales have grown their own mystical charisma: especially in
an age when the march of civilisation has made such remote outposts of
Nature rarer and rarer.
When two practitioners of the wanderlust movie now squiring their work
through London - Roland Joffe (City Of Joy) and Werner Herzog (Scream Of
Stone) - were offered to me for FT interviews, I thought about it and then
declined. Main reason: I have met both men before and know the crash-course
verbal deliriums they supply when asked to rationalise the irrational.
For there is an irrational beauty in the hostile-locale movie. The best such
films succumb to the hallucinatory transports that afflict travellers lost
in the desert, while even the worst provide moments of crazed beauty amid
the banality. All the more reason not to trust the directors' PR arias.
Doing so, you would believe that two key tendencies mark the wanderlust
movie. It never fails to establish a miraculous, mutually improving rapport
between the visitors and the place and its people. And it always ensures
that no harm physical or cultural is done to the environment and its
inhabitants, human or animal.
This last tendency is a worthy but menacing one. Though the jungle is still
the ideal locale for wanderlust movies, blending lyrical luxuriance with
danger and deprivation, it has been tamed by political correctness in recent
years. Where the spell of that greatest of all postwar wanderlust movies,
Herzog's Aguirre (1973), lay in its surrender to an anarchic Arcadia - a
pre-lapsarian Eden where good and evil flourished unclothed and unnamed -
modern movies like The Emerald Forest, At Play In The Fields Of The Lord and
Medicine Man parcel out Paradise into neat moral equations. Primitive native
society is good; civilised white society is bad. And just as the film unit
itself must be seen not to harm its virgin location, so we the audience must
hiss at any character within the film who tries to deflower the earthly
Paradise.
Even Herzog in his latest movie Scream Of Stone, shot in a non-jungle South
America, has succumbed to the modern labelling-and-lecturing habit. Though
this mountaineering yarn often exposes itself thrillingly to its naked
locales - mountain peak, glacier, icy crevasse - it is too glibly mapped out
with moral markers whenever the characters swap action for dialogue. Note
the opposition between the nasty media man played by Donald Sutherland,
carrying the bacillus of white American civilisation, and the
saintly-laconic native Indians or the Italian mountaineer (Vittorio
Mezzogiorno) who lives hermit-like alone with Nature.
The best wanderlust films surrender to a dramatic as well as a physical
terra incognita; the worst ones take a place and its spirit and torture them
to fit a modish or pre-designed thesis. Thus Roland Joffe's films, from The
Killing Fields and The Mission to his new City Of Joy, shot on Calcutta
streets that proved no less foreign and hostile than the deepest jungle,
function more powerfully in their early disorienting scenes - when the
viewer like the characters must pick his way through a yet-unmapped
labyrinth of places, themes and emotions - than when the signposts come out,
moral and geographical, and the director hoves into view offering roadside
assistance.
There are three main movie-making responses to wild places. Joffe, as City
Of Joy demonstrates, is a message-monger foolish enough to try to bend
wildernesses to his Western bromides about hope and humanism. Other
film-makers like Herzog, at his best, are able to tune into the native
wavelength and find inspiration rather than impose it in wild locales. For
other film-makers still, a third and more perilous extreme beckons.
Here 'going native' implies something grotesque and Conradian: as in the
psychological jungle fever that overtook Coppola when filming Apocalypse
Now, his updating of Heart Of Darkness. Out in the Philippines, Coppola's
unit suffered everything from heart attacks (star Martin Sheen) to
weather-destroyed sets (an entire mock-Vietnamese village) to the absurdist
coup de grace of a guest star (Marlon Brando) at once too fat and too
thinly-prepared for his crucial role.
Impossible to believe that this chaos would have raged if the film had been
shot in a studio on soundstages and backlots (as Orson Welles planned to
shoot Heart Of Darkness back in 1941, before he was sidetracked by Citizen
Kane). But equally, Apocalypse Now captures something of the terrible beauty
of an uncharted war in an uncharted land, if only by succumbing to some
uncharted madnesses all its own.
But at best in the wanderlust genre, the spirit of place can be a force
disciplining as well as terrifying, authenticating as well as disorienting.
It may be Lillian Gish riding the ice-floes in Griffith's Way Down East; or
the storm-torn landscapes sculpted by pioneer location director Robert
Flaherty in his earliest docudramas (Nanook Of The North, Man Of Aran); or
David Lean's epic frescoes of sand and light in Lawrence Of Arabia; or Klaus
Kinski on his current-caught Amazonian raft, circling into madness in
Herzog's Aguirre; or Herzog (again) conjuring dramatic as well as physical
mirages from the deserts of Fata Morgana or Even Dwarfs Started Small.
Most recently of all, Bruce Beresford in Black Robe accompanied his crew and
actors into Canada's wintry wastes and returned with a film overpowering in
its beauty and sense of authenticity. Just as Brian Moore's original novel
presented a moral wilderness shot through with primitive, patternless shafts
of fear and love and cruelty, so Beresford found in his literal wilderness
the courage to step away from stereotypes and storyboarded emotions to
confront the savage - noble and ignoble - in us all.
The greatest challenge that the far-flung location issues to the film-maker
is to throw away the old maps, dramatic as well as geographical, and to
honour wild unknown worlds with new and bold dramatic patterns of his own.

THE BOOK in Radio 4's morning parliamentary slot this week is Sue Townsend's
The Queen and I, which I think a very bad joke. Great Britain has become a
democracy. The Royal Family is moved into council houses, so there are
ready-made jokes about excessive furniture and the Queen having no coin for
what is explained to her as the gas-meter. Miriam Margolyes, a player I much
admire, does her best to imitate the royal voices. John Tydeman directs,
doubtless out of loyalty to Townsend, for he directed Adrian Mole in its
day.
On the other hand, Radio 4 shows its fidelity with the Radio Times/Radio 4
Enterprise Awards, for which we shall hear about the 12 shortlisted entrants
over the weeks. There are two awards annually and this is the tenth year -
Pounds 10,000 for a business founded between two and five years ago, and
Pounds 5000 for one founded two years ago or less. This week the entry for
the top award was Deep Sea Adventure, of Weymouth, a museum that former
deep-sea diver Brian Cooper equipped to show the history and the adventure
of his craft. It was opened in 1988 by the Princess Royal, and has become a
great success.
For the other award, Richard Wilson and Carl Beeson bought an unused brewery
and began to brew their own own beer, to be distributed by a wholesaler
wherever there is a demand. If I can find a local pub serving Summerskill's
Whistle Belly Vengeance, I shall certainly take a pint or so on its name
alone. Just why Radio 4 should be subsidising private business out of my
license fee is another matter, that I shall not discuss here.
Howard Wakeling's A Bit of Berlin, Radio 4's Monday play, was artificial,
but provocative in theme. Vic and Barbara (James Grout and Rowena Cooper)
visit their son Mark (Julian Rhind-Tutt) in Berlin, where he has lived for
five years without seeing them. Vic is aghast to find that his son is gay,
running a gay club with a young German. But he is in hospital after a
beating-up by roughs from East Berlin.
Now Vic served in Berlin in 1946, and he and his mate beat up a Berliner
whom they thought was a pervert. We hear the sound of this now and then.
Then we get the similarly motivated attack on Mark, that has sent him to
hospital. We are to see how thought has become freer since 1946, as shown,
or not, in these folks' beliefs. But we we are never really in Berlin,
either today, or in 1946. Little was done by author or director (Janet
Whitaker) to suggest it. We could be anywhere: but not Zagreb.
If you kept switched on for the next programme, The Yugoslavia Notes, you
had a vivid picture of Zagreb from American reporter William T. Vollman.
This is not an account of the warfare, but of the effect of warfare on its
denizens. Vollman tells of a visit to the cathedral, of a man hypnotised by
a women's clothes shop window, of a father and his 18-year-old son in a
restaurant. His speech suggests Hemingway, intent on the significant detail,
with vividly near-poetic phrases irradiating the straightforward idiom. We
are to have more of Vollman, and I think it may be memorable.
Authors' week on Radio 3. On Saturday, Leps gave Vladimir Nabokov's pleasant
memories of catching butterflies - not live, alas, but read by Hugh Dickson.
On Sunday, Somerset Maugham, though not exactly live, was heard in a
recording of a live talk on his 80th birthday in 1954, dealing mostly with
his previous 50 years. As a student, his flat cost him 18s. a week. A trip
to Pisa, Florence and Venice was Pounds 30. Then he wrote Liza of Lambeth;
and then he wrote Lady Frederick, which ran at the Royal Court for 18
months. The stammer we were accustomed to was no doubt edited out of the
tape, for there was no sign of it. Next week, Compton Mackenzie.

MY GOLDEN TRADES by Ivan Klima Granta Pounds 13.99, 284 pages
SPRING STREET SUMMER by Christopher Hudson Viking Pounds 16.99, 260 pages
GREAT MEADOW by Dirk Bogarde Viking Pounds 15.99, 207 pages
HILAIRE Belloc once quipped: 'Just as there is nothing between the admirable
omelette and the intolerable, so with autobiographies.' These three books
prove him right.
Each is a memoir of a few years in a life, each evokes a specific place and
its cultural landscape precisely when that landscape was being swept away
for ever, and each successfully re-creates a vanished world: the last
communist days in Prague; the hippie hangover in 1970s California; and
childhood in pre-war Sussex. But what tells the men from the boys is not the
recall of tangible reality but the authentic portrayal of the self. How does
the writer tick, respond to his times, find meaning? When addressed with
curiosity, detachment and wit, the reader is compelled to share in the quest
and a life story can be the stuff of art.
My Golden Trades tells of the unlikely jobs Ivan Klima did when prevented
from writing. The proverb 'a trade is a handful of gold' suggests a worker
will never be poor; as surveyor and archaeologist, Klima ironically gained
access to the secret life of 1980s Czechoslovakia, from Semtex factories to
toxic forests, that enriches his writing. The result is stories which move
seamlessly from the immediate to the profound, imagination packed into every
paragraph: devastating truths about the regime, thoughts on love, history
and Kafka, slip out as simply as an account of buying a schnitzel.
In his novel Love and Garbage, writer turns Prague roadsweeper; here too,
double persona yields a mix of mundane and sublime, trivial and doomed. In
'The Engine Driver's Story', Klima drives a friend, beaten up by police to
hospital, then is himself followed. Fear eats through every cobbled alley,
yet the story turns absurd; he must find his driver's licence, which perhaps
is valid, from people who may help or menace, in one of millions of
bureaucratic files across Prague. As in Kafka, terror lies in
meaninglessness; individual confusion, humiliation versus state power,
control.
Part autobiography, part fiction, part reflection, all the strands of the
stories are enmeshed in subtle parallels. Klima lived in Prague's jewish
ghetto under Nazi occupation and repudiates all regimes which strip away
humanity: 'My experience of life so far led me to two simple, if
contradictory, conclusions. The first one was: everything evil a person can
imagine can in fact happen. The second derives from the first: nothing that
will happen to me in life can be worse than what has already happened to
me.'
Klima echoes the lightness of being of his compatriot Milan Kundera; also
the unquenchable curiosity of another victim of oppression, Primo Levi.
Here, the joy in everyday lives, the laughter in the dark which marks his
novels, are enhanced by a personal sense of the writer as he struggles
through the dying fall of communist Europe.
By contrast Hudson and Bogarde write elegies for a lost paradise. Hudson's
problem is that he is so obtrusively the centre of his own Eden. In 1976 a
young man - 'let's call him C' - on a fellowship to research the history of
paradise in western culture, visits the University of California at Santa
Cruz as the nearest approximation to pre-lapsarian bliss in 1970s America.
Now our author H retraces C's steps to find the 'missing person' who spent a
season high on drugs, sex and California sunshine in the communal house of
Spring Street Summer. Cliche by cliche Arcadia returns: naked girls drape
themselves in a snake while digging vegetables; C and girl friend Laura
'made love on floors, on rugs, on the grass - pretty much everywhere except
in bed.'
What this book most recalls is not free love and orange juice but a heavy
session with a friend: it has a ghoulish compulsion until, half a bottle of
whisky later, you wonder how much more kiss and tell you can take. C was
'the youngest commissioning publisher in London: now he was the youngest
literary editor, and for a weekly journal internationally famous.' Beautiful
girls nibble his ear while he listens to George Steiner lecture, but he is
of course just complexed enough to worry about the conquests he notches up.
Presumably to explain this, his research - Christian guilt via Augustine and
Aquinas - is dribbled through his story. It is as shallow and predictable as
the third strand of recollection: the re-acquaintance with the Spring Street
drop-outs who have grown up into 1980s lawyers and technologists.
Back before the Fall, Dirk Bogarde spent his childhood from 1927 to 1934 in
a cottage in Sussex which is appealingly recalled in Great Meadow. There are
summer rambles, harvest mice, Christmas puddings and arguments with nanny,
while father, a Times journalist, rings London on Christmas Day from a pay
phone in the village and meets Jewish refugees off the boat at Newhaven.
Bogarde sometimes sounds like Winnie the Pooh and seems unsure whether he is
writing for adults or children. But he has a fine ear for period dialogue
and sensitively sets the rumble of realpolitik against a quintessential
evocation of the English pastoral dream.

THE FALL OF YUGOSLAVIA: THE THIRD BALKAN WAR by Misha Glenny Penguin Pounds
5.99, 194 pages
THE war in the former Yugoslavia is not easy to explain. It is about a
conflict between the rural and the urban population. It is about unsettled
business between Croats and Serbs predating 1918. It is about different
cultures imbued with weak traditions of obligation and contract. It is about
societies seeking revenge because each believe they are the greatest victims
of the past. Misha Glenny, the BBC's Central European correspondent, has
tackled all these issues with sympathy and insight. In doing so, I hope the
underlying theme of his excellent book has not been smothered.
The communist system imposed on Yugoslavia by the western powers and the
late President Tito extolled the virtues of 'Brotherhood and Unity' at the
cost of brutally suppressing national feeling. This meant that Tito
prevented any discussion about the past, in particular the complex
relationship between Serbs and Croats. Glenny rightly argues that, until
these two ethnic groups come to terms with each other, there will be no
peace in the Balkan peninsula. The indefatigable United Nations peacekeepers
in Croatia will testify to that.
The collapse of the communist system in turn exposed the schizophrenic
nature of these two ethnic groups, each claiming to be more modern and
European than each other, yet each doggedly locked in the past. Croatian
president Franjo Tudjman, a former communist and army general, vowed to make
his independent Croatia the 'most democratic' of all democracies. Yet he
never made room in the republic for the large ethnic Serb community, which
was forced to sign a loyalty oath and treated as second-class citizens. This
uncompromising attitude radicalised the Serbs in Krajina, south-west
Croatia, and in eastern Croatia.
Tudjman's vanity and authoritarianism, backed by Germany and some other
western countries, played into the hands of Serbian president Slobodan
Milosevic. Unlike Tudjman, who used power to create a nationalist state,
Milosevic used nationalism (and the federal army) to pursue power. This
meant that the Serbian leader could manipulate the Serbs in Croatia as long
as they were of use to him. He will do the same in Bosnia until Bosnia's
Serbs, led by Radovan Karadzic, have served their purpose.
It is difficult to know what Milosevic wants from his war with Croatia and
Bosnia. As Glenny shows, his quest for a greater Serbia has already led to
the violent destruction of Yugoslavia and Serbia's isolation. But one thing
is certain from this cruel war: sons and daughters from mixed marriages are
today forced to choose their ethnic background if they want rights to
citizenship and property. That is the tragedy of Bosnia, once a rich ethnic
patchwork, and the fate of the people of Sarajevo, one of the most
cosmopolitan cities in the Balkans.
If Tudjman and Milosevic have forced the people of Bosnia, Croatia and
Serbia to choose sides, Glenny believes Macedonia, Kosovo and the rest of
the Balkan peninsula could follow suit. I would go one stage further. The
war in Yugoslavia has sharpened ethnic divisions to such an extent that the
Karadzics, Milosevics and Tudjmans will only be content once they have
created ethnically-pure, but intolerant and thuggish states.
Indifference has led western governments into condoning this trend, which
will have consequences for the eastern Europe and the republics of the
former Soviet Union. In consequence of the use of ethnic criteria to create
new states in the post-communist world, the prospects of these states
creating civil societies based on the rule of law are as grim as the
prospects of peace and democracy in the region.

admires a stylish brand of eccentricity

OTTOLINE MORRELL: LIFE ON THE GRAND SCALE by Miranda Seymour Hodder &amp;
Stoughton Pounds 25, 452 pages
'THE so-called portraits of Ottoline can't possibly be Ottoline', DH
Lawrence wrote from Florence in 1928 to the subject of this biography. It
was a letter ostensibly to commiserate with Ottoline on her 'mysterious
illness' and operation on her jaw, where cancer had been diagnosed. The
resulting shape of her chin was a hideous disfigurement of a once beautiful
woman. As well as sending a get-well-soon greeting Lawrence took the
opportunity to try to heal the 12-year-long breach in their relations.
Contact between them, initially so warm, had ceased abruptly on the
appearance of Women in Love.
Almost all the novelists whom Ottoline entertained in her celebrated salon
in Bedford Square before the First World War, and at Garsington Manor during
and after the War, found her stylish brand of eccentricity an irresistible
challenge. Ottoline, a half-sister of the Duke of Portland, was a maze of
contradictions - simultaneously an aristocrat, an aesthete and an artists'
groupie.
Aldous Huxley put her into three of his books: as Priscilla Wimbush in Crome
Yellow (1921) - where she appears against the background of a typical
Garsington weekend; as Mrs Aldwinkle in Those Barren Leaves (1925); as Mrs
Bidlake in Point Counter Point (1928). Virginia Woolf embellished letters to
friends they had in common and her journal with some coruscating vignettes
of 'Ott'. Miranda Seymour believes that there is also more than a hint of
Ottoline in Clarissa Dalloway. Graham Greene confessed to borrowing Ottoline
for Lady Patricia Bury in Its A Battlefield.
Osbert Sitwell in Triple Fugue (1924) called her Lady Septugesima Goodley.
The name guys Ottoline's lifelong passion for do-gooding. It had been
sparked by Charles Kingsley, whose books she loved as a child and who was a
friend of her parents, the Bentincks. Readings from Thomas a Kempis
confirmed her ambition to occupy the high moral ground. Height was indeed
what immediately struck you on meeting Ottoline. As Sitwell put it: she was
so tall she looked like 'an animated public monument' and with a voice that
resembled the 'peaceful lowing of cattle and the barbed drone of wasp and
hornet'.
Miranda Seymour also cites obscure Otto-novels by Gilbert Cannan, 'JA
Revermort' (John Cramb), the Australian-born music critic WJ Turner, and the
Irish actress Constance Malleson, Ottoline's rival in the great game of
being bedded by Bertie Russell. This the actress eventually won, but only
after a series of strenuous heats. Ottoline had ditched the painter Henry
Lamb as her lover for the more intellectual allurements of the philosopher.
Ottoline shrugged off the lesser fictional caricatures. It was Lawrence's -
Ottoline as Hermione Roddice ('. . . she had no natural sufficiency, there
was a terrible void, a lack, a deficiency of being within her . . . ', etc.
etc.') - that left the lasting wound. But in that belated olive-branch
letter Lawrence did his best to restore Ottoline's self-esteem. 'And in the
world today', he continued, 'full of women, how rare to find one that can
move the imagination] No, I wish, and wish deeply, there could be Ottoline
again and Garsington again, and we could start afresh'.
Crocodile tears? Lawrence had at that moment just completed a new novel. It
concerned a married woman with a title who had a passionate affair with a
game-keeper on her estate and he felt sure that Ottoline would understand
what he was trying to do in it - 'the re-entry into life' he told her 'of a
bit of the old phallic awareness and the old phallic insouciance.' Could
this, Miranda Seymour asks, have been yet one more fictional go at Ottoline
herself?
The parallels between Ottoline and Lady Chatterley are in some respects
close. Ottoline's relations with her husband Philip Morrell, the lawyer and
Liberal MP by whom she had a daughter, soon became companionable rather than
passionate. Though not disabled like Clifford Chatterley, Philip did suffer
from bouts of mental illness that had probably prevented him from reaching
ministerial rank; even though Asquith was a personal friend of theirs who
enjoyed meeting literati like Desmond MacCarthy on the Garsington lawn, he
never promoted Morrell
After Ottoline ceded Russell to the Irish actress she had what her
biographer believes to be the only truly satisfactory sexual liaison of her
life. It was with a local Oxfordshire stone mason - Lionel Gomme, always
known in her journals as 'Tiger' - who had come to mend a damaged plinth in
the garden at Garsington. It wasn't only the statue around which he put his
arms and relocated.
Clearly a woman of this calibre, reflected in so much of 20th-century
fiction and its annals, deserves a biography. There was a life of her
published in 1976, but much new material has become available since then.
Unlike the previous biographer, Miranda Seymour has a double-focus: on Ott
in the foreground and, in the middle distance, on her ever-changing circle
of eminent friends.
Sybil Colefax certainly entertained as many, if not more, celebrated people
in her time; but she was, at heart, a mere collector. Ottoline, for all her
absurdities, was an inspiration. From an early age she saw her role as one
of helping creative people to realise themselves, and in this regard her
discernment was exceptional and her altruism tireless - even though,
contrary to general belief, the Morrells were never really rich. Among the
many writers she encouraged when they were unknown was Henry Green, who paid
a memorable tribute to her after her death in 1938 aged 64.
What Ottoline had not quite bargained for was the astonishing vindictiveness
of the inhabitants of the London literary world, their compulsion to bite
the hand that feeds them. In Ottoline's far too forbearing case she would
often continue feeding someone after he or she had snapped at her. She was
immensely supportive of Roger Fry when he was being reviled for organising
the first post-impressionist exhibition in London, and she helped him in the
formation of the Contemporary Art Society. They became great friends until
he turned on her viciously because someone had spread the rumour that he was
in love with her. The other Bloomsberries followed suit in undermining her
reputation.
Logan Pearsall Smith had more cause for hatred since his sister was
Russell's first wife. But luckily Ottoline acquired new friends as easily as
she shed old ones. She made much of the Oxford connection. A visit to
Garsington was essential for any undergraduate with literary leanings in the
Brideshead years. Evelyn Waugh, Peter Quennell, David Cecil, LP Hartley,
Eddy Sackville-West, Robert Gathorne-Hardy and Anthony Powell were among her
visitors.
Miranda Seymour is infinitely more successful here than she was in her
previous group-book, Ring of Conspirators, concerning Henry James and his
circle at Rye. Here, there really was a ring of conspirators who did what
they did in envy of great Ottoline. They are all seen off the premises
brilliantly.

RUM PUNCH Elmore Leonard Viking Pounds 14.99, 297 pages
AT THE start, Elmore Leonard puts you right there: 'Chris Mankowski's last
day on the job, two in the afternoon, two hours to go, he got a call to
dispose of a bomb'; or, 'Dale Crowe Junior told Kathy Baker, his probation
officer, he didn't see where he had done anything wrong.' Those are from
Freaky Deaky and Maximum Bob, Leonard's best to date.
Rum Punch, Leonard's 30th and latest, opens with a sentence that gives you
who's doing what to whom, and where: 'Sunday morning, Ordell took Louis to
watch the white-power demonstration in downtown Palm Beach.' Perfect.
This new one is par for Leonard. Jackie is a flight attendant caught with
Dollars 50,000 out of Grand Bahama into Miami. She does a deal with the cops
and finds herself in a Bahamian triangle consisting of an arms dealer called
Ordell, a bail bondsman (business card, 'Gentlemen Prefer Bonds') called
Max, and an ex-con called Louis Gara. She promises to hand Ordell to the
cops, and fixes with Max to walk off with Dollars 500,000 of Ordell's arms
money while he's doing time in Club Fed.
This is typical of the Leonard genre. But how good is Leonard? Or as he says
in Get Shorty, 'Guy thinks he's mean. I wouldn't mind you ran into him. See
if he's real.'
Leonard began writing professionally at 42 in 1967; he had been in
advertising, and turned his pen to sharp Westerns and a series of
beautifully messy, unpretentious thrillers. He has few heroes; his
characters are often confused middle-intelligence low-lifers on the make,
trying to pull some modest scam that invariably goes wrong.
There are three things, all connected with the changing shape of Leonard's
America, that set him apart from his forbears in the 1940s and 1950s,
Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Ross Macdonald.
First, Leonard writes provincial thrillers, sets them in LA, Miami, Detroit;
he avoids the big-city image just as he avoids industry knowledge (racing,
diamonds). He writes about cities the way Randy Newman sings about them:
messy and bleak.
Second, Leonard has no narrator, no Lew Archer or Philip Marlowe; the scene
follows the viewpoint of whoever Leonard is writing about: 'Now it was the
hip place to be in South Florida. Guys with sunglasses in their hair posed
skinny girls on the beach and photographed them. There was no place to park
any more on ocean drive.' His characters are diverse, seeing the world in
terms of their own prejudice: white trash, niggers, Hispanics.
Third, Leonard writes dialogue like film, straight from Damon Runyon and
David Mamet, 'You understand how this woman thinks? You do, huh? It even
makes sense to you.' Where a Chandler or Macdonald character will lurk in
the shadow, light a cigarette, a Leonard character will introduce himself
with a statement-question: 'the fock's goin' on.' The verbal energy comes
from either doing or saying: 'He racked the slide and stuck the gun inside
his coveralls, saying to Louis, 'You ready? Let's shake and bake.''
Leonard is unremittingly direct and precise, the action only as complicated
as it needs to be. Each scene starts as close to the end as possible. There
are no fancy murders, the victims are shot five times or thrown off a
fifteen-floor building. In Rum Punch, Ordell visits a suspect out on bail:
'He shot him in his bare chest. He seemed to cave in like the air was let
out of him and Ordell put one in his head. Loud. Man, but it was a nasty gun
the way it jumped and felt like it stung your hand . . .'
The Leonard genre is not the classic detective novel. He avoids designer
crime, and grafts the casual violence onto the local stock. These are never
whodunits, they never involve big conspiracies, just local difficulty of the
worst kind. The other Leonard trademarks, alongside the muscular dialogues
and tricksy shifts of narrative, are an encyclopedic interest in light arms
(Rum Punch reels with Uzis, AK-47s, Smith &amp; Wessons), cars ('Olds
Ninety-Eight, 12-gauge in the trunk'), and drugs. He peoples the action with
colourful dead-ends, like Zorro, the Puerto Rican burglar with swords, hyper
women and partners called pistolocos.
The genre, especially the recent novels, can be kind to women. There is
little exploitative sex, even if it goes with sun and sea in Florida. His
women are assertive, if not in charge. He rewrites the cliches for them. At
the end of Rum Punch, Jackie has got away with the Dollars 500,000 and Max
the bail bondsman has helped her. Will they split? 'She walked around to the
other side and looked across the low black Mercedes at him. 'Come on, Max.
I'll take you away from all this.''

LIVE FROM GOLGOTHA by Gore Vidal Andre Deutsch Pounds 14.99, 232 pages
HOT ON the heels of AN Wilson's book on Jesus comes a novel by Gore Vidal on
the same subject but with a considerably different tone and intention.
Whereas Wilson ferrets earnestly for the 'truth', Vidal treats the whole
mish-mash with magisterial disdain. With unerring instinct he homes in not
on Jesus himself but on the peripheral yet highly important figure of St
Paul. The Gospel According To Gore Vidal opens like Genesis, 'In the
beginning . . .' - but it continues, 'was the nightmare and the knife was
with St Paul, and the circumcision was a Jewish notion and definitely not
mine'.
St Paul sends a message from Heaven to his acolyte Timothy, a Bishop in the
first century AD. A mysterious Hacker is erasing the story of Jesus as told
in the Gospels. Timothy, as the only witness to the Crucifixion that the
computer virus cannot get to, is to write everything down as he remembers
it.
At this point the maid arrives with a television set. Timothy has no idea
what a television set is but he is soon to learn. Through the set, as a
hologram, there emerges Chester W. Claypoole, vice president of NBC-General
Electric, who announces that he is planning to pre-record the Crucifixion
'live from Golgotha'. He wants Timothy to be anchorperson at the event.
From this moment on the novel moves backwards and forwards in what is not so
much a time-warp as as time-scramble. As Timothy retraces his travels with
St Paul it is revealed that 'Saint' is a champion fund-raiser and
crowd-pleaser. After his performances he passes round the collection box. He
is an astute entrepreneur: it was his idea that the Messiah was too big an
enterprise for just the one tribe. It also emerges that Jesus was only five
feet tall and enormously fat. This shocking news is linked with the eerie
presence of one Marvin Wasserstein, against whom St Paul has already warned
Timothy.
After travelling to Corinth and Ephesus and being raped by Nero in Rome,
Timothy finally meets Marvin himself who - horror of horrors - is not a
hologram but a living person: small, thin, with thick glasses, and wearing a
yarmulke. A shiver runs through Timothy as he realises that Marvin is the
Hacker and that the Hacker is Jesus.
A Zionist zealot, Jesus 'fingered' Judas at the Crucifixion, persuading the
Roman soldiers that the fat Judas was the Messiah. Jesus escaped, becoming
Marvin Wasserstein with the master plan of re-writing the Gospels. Marvin's
aim is to persuade the world that St Paul's great invention - that Jesus
died on the Cross in order to save Gentiles as well as Jews - is utterly
wrong. Jesus, King of the Jews, is to lead a nationalist insurrection and
the world will end in nuclear war in the year 2001.
Dr Cutler, the brain behind the computer technology which has led to this
pretty pass, persuades Timothy that he must denounce Marvin. He does so and
the 'real' Crucifixion takes place. Marvin transforms himself into the
Messiah and, as the television camera pans upward from the face of the dead
Christ to the sun, we see the figure of Amaterasu - the Sun Goddess from
whom Japan's holy emperors are descended. Dr Cutler is not put out. Nippon
is going to take over anyway, and to say that Jesus was a son of a Goddess
and not of a God is a slight matter of gender, highly correct in today's
world of triumphant feminism.
What will the effect of this outrageously cynical, irreverent book be?
Nothing, I should think, except pleasure after the storm has blown over.
Vidal has played God with the conflicting facts of the Christian story and
established his own triumphant trinity.
In the first place, he has had a good old romp with the Academy, showing
that he, too, if he cares, can be a post-Modernist, that he can out-Derrida
the Deconstructionists with the twists and turns of his fantasy. In the
second, he has mercilessly satirised television, whose audiences and
commercial values he detests. In the third, he has poked fun at the
Christian religion, putting the church of St Paul in line with the church of
Oral Roberts.
The Fathers will bleat blasphemy, but in the end Vidal will have harmed no
one. Christians are not going to put out a contract on him as the Moslems
did on Rushdie, and the millions who believe in an ever-loving Jesus will be
unmoved in their faith. Gore is sitting pretty.
Live from Golgotha is in the tradition of Myra Breckinridge, Myron and
Duluth, but more pointed and more daring. At the age of 67 (today is his
birthday), Vidal is still going strong. Who says there are no second acts in
American lives?

FT  03 OCT 92 / Collecting: Traditional dealers on top - Nicholas Powell
tests the water for Paris' contemporary art fair this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL

<TEXT>
WHILE the art world prepares for the huge Paris contemporary art fair FIAC
this month reports are going round New York that no fewer than 100 Parisian
galleries have been forced to close by the recession. The figure is
inflated, but it is true that an unprecedented purge is on after years of
careless prosperity.
Galleries in France doubled in the 1980's from just over 500 to more than a
1,000, while sales of modern and contemporary paintings at auction tripled
between 1985-1990. Galleries working not directly with artists but
specialising in quick resales sprang up not only around the trendy east end
Bastille area but also on the Right Bank.
This year the effects of the 1990 contemporary art market crash which
started in New York began swathing through Paris. Prices for paintings have
dropped by a rough average of 50 per cent and turnover has fallen
proportionately.
Not only speculative dealers but quality dealers have been hit. Isy Brachot,
who also has a gallery in Bruxelles, closed his Left Bank Paris headquarters
this year. Baudoin Lebon, a specialist in leading French artist Jean
Dubuffet, had to file a petition in bankruptcy. Galerie Daniel Lelong, which
represents stars such as Francis Bacon and Spanish artist Antoni Tapies, has
been forced to shed half its staff and close one of its two Paris premises.
Antoine Candau, one of the first dealers championing young contemporary
artists to set up in the Bastille area, has gone out of business.
Most well established galleries with good stocks and good stables of
artists, however, are weathering the crisis. Brand new galleries with low
overheads representing up and coming, low priced artists are even beginning
to open in the streets around the Bastille.
The real test of the health of Paris's and Europe's contemporary art market
comes when the week long Paris FIAC (Foire Internationale de l'Art
Contemporain), one of the world's top fairs, opens in the Grand Palais on
October 24. Some 100,000 people are expected to visit 161 galleries, 87 of
them from abroad, representing works by some 700 artists. Some 400 more
dealers applied to take part and were refused.
Last year economic gloom frightened a lot of people at the FIAC into showing
very staid, classical material. This year looks like being livelier now that
the gloom has become chronic. A large number of stands are staging
particularly fine one man shows.
Paris dealer Marwan Hoss is showing 20 recent large format works by
reclusive Canadian painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, his first Paris exhibition in
10 years. Jacqueline Moussion is showing the work of the French based Haiti
born artist Herve Telemaque and the Korean Moon-Seup Shim. The works by the
former are stark combinations of minimalist sculpture and videos evoking
Haiti and its ills. Those by Shim form an altogether more tranquil
collection of sculptures in iron.
Jacqueline Moussion thinks it quite normal that some Paris galleries should
have disappeared while others, like hers, ride out the recession. 'Most of
those who have gone to the wall were merely commercial and didn't know what
art is. The best dealers always refused to supply their artists' works to
the galleries and auction houses out for short term profits. Dealers who
work with a stable of artists, foreign galleries, museum curators and
collectors will survive.'
MEANWHILE, the presence of the world's biggest spender, the Sultan of
Brunei, was reported stalking the jewellery section of the Biennale des
Antiquaires which was greeted with understandable joy. For this year the 120
participants at the world's grandest antiques and fine art show spent as
never before - FFr 50m all in all - to make the event as spectacular an
attraction as possible. It has been a huge success. Only a few days after
the opening of Biennale, which ends tomorrow, big sales were being reported.
Paris dealer Yves Mikaeloff's stand was soon deprived of its star exhibit, a
massive, FFr 12m, mahogany and gilded bronze commode made in 1770 by French
cabinet-makers Severin and Foullet - the client insisted on taking it with
him. Mikaeloff also sold two paintings, five drawings and a William Morris
carpet while his neighbours, tapestry specialists Galerie Chevalier, parted
with eight pieces ranging from FFr 80,000 - FFr 2m, all to new clients, on
the first day.
The overall quality of the art has never been so high. Thanks to 18th
century French specialists such as the Antiquaires a Paris group, the
quality of furniture is top notch. Jean Lupu boasts a very rare Riesener
table of 1780 from the Roseberry collection and a rosewood and porcelain
plaque desk made by Martin Carlin for the marriage of the Comte d'Artois,
brother of Louis XVI.
Carlton Hobbs from London, a newcomer, is showing extremely fine 18th-19th
century Russian and English furniture. The standard of Old Master paintings
is better than ever with specialists such as Agnew's and Richard Green from
London and Haboldt and Tassel from Paris joined this year for the first time
by Colnaghi, who set up a gallery in Paris earlier in the year.
A major attraction on the Colnaghi stand and perfect for the French market
was La Baigneuse, a masterpiece by 18th century aritst Francois Le Moyne
which recently surfaced in Brazil. Newhouse Galleries of New York, teamed up
with Verner Amell of London, are showing an historical and exceedingly fine
imaginary landscape by three leading Italian artists of the day - Canaletto,
Pittoni and Cimaroli, commissioned in 1722 by the Irish actor and playwright
Owen McSwiny on behalf of Lord March. It was on offer for Pounds 950,000.
Nearby, hangs one of the very last paintings by Chardin we will ever see on
the market - an exquisite still life of peaches, pears and a beaker of wine
of 1760.
Dealers in highly specialised fields had clearly made an effort to display
exceptional stock. Sarti of London had a Virgin by 15th century Florentin
painter Gherardo Starnina and a late 16th century Italian marble marquetry
table top which both deserve to go straight to a museum. Brussels based
Chinese art specialist Gisele Croes, one of several oriental art specialists
present, attracted a lot of attention from museum curators with an
exhibition of Han and Tang period earthenware figures, Shang period bronzes
in perfect condition and nine exceedingly rare sculpted bronze plates from
the Dian kingdom, representing hunting scenes and with price tags of between
Dollars 80-100,000.
Decoration on the grandest of scales is catered for, too with several
furniture dealers chosing to wall their stands with antique wood panelling.
Achkar Charriere boasts painted panels with inset canvases by late 18th
century painter Fassin from Liege. Gismondi of Paris has late 18th Century,
light blue and green panels complete with a bas relief panel by sculptor
Clodion. Axel Vervoordt from Antwerp offered one room of 18th century French
white colonnaded bookcase panelling and a complete Louis XIV room stripped
to its original light green paint in order to set off, he said, his antique
Chinese bronzes.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: Message for the minister - Off the wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER Brooke undertook his first public engagements as Heritage Minister
yesterday. He visited the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and then drummed up
support for the northern branch of the Association for Business Sponsorship
of the Arts: a nice mix of avant-garde and commercial.
Brooke arrives with the advantage of low expectations from the artistic
mafia. His only known arty interest - he is a Trustee of Wordsworth's Dove
Cottage - hardly matches the encyclopaedic musical knowledge of David
Mellor. But the history of arts ministers suggests that the novices to the
field, like Richard Luce, often deliver more in actual results than the
panjandrums like Lord St John of Fawsley.
Brooke will keep a lower profile than Mellor, mainly for security reasons
(he served a stint in Northern Ireland). But while Mellor never got round to
making many decisions Brooke is carrying home bulging red boxes shrieking
with issues needing judgments.
The most important in the short term is the size of the arts and heritage
grant for 1993-94 which will be decided by Mr Portillo and the Treasury in
the next six weeks. Even Mellor, who had John Major's backing to boost
national well-being through a cultural revival, was warning against too much
optimism in the current financial climate. But Brooke, as a newcomer, should
qualify for a boost and could get a grant uplift slightly above the
inflation rate.
Then Brooke must decide his attitude to the Arts Council. Less than a year
ago the Council was on the ropes. The Arts Minister of the day, Tim Renton,
was keen to devolve most of its clients to new regional arts boards, and to
control the grants of the big companies direct. Suddenly this all changed.
Mellor was against devolution. He was also lining up the Arts Council to act
as the distribution channel for Lottery money when that comes on stream. His
disappearance is a bad blow for the Council. If the Whitehall bureaucrats
capture the ear of Brooke its future once again becomes uncertain.
As for the Lottery, this could be the key to it all. Mellor was a great fan,
keen to introduce the Bill before Christmas, and prepared to battle in the
Commons to make sure that the debilitating amendments expected to be tabled
were defeated. It will require a deep *something in here (HP) *
commitment by Brooke to ensure that the promised Pounds 1b from Lottery
proceeds actually comes through to fructify the artistic, heritage, and
sporting life of the nation.
Throw in the future of the BBC, the fate of the National Arts Strategy, and
the little matter of a home for the Heritage Ministry and Brooke would seem
to have no spare time to get embroiled in the long running saga of Covent
Garden. He should. If he knocked a few heads together there his reign could
get off to a spectacular start.
This week's two investigations into the travails of the Royal Opera House
took us back nine years to the Priestley Report and the last major
assessment of its strengths and weaknesses. Clive Priestley, like Warnock
and Price Waterhouse on Thursday, also praised Covent Garden's artistic
output, criticised its management, and said that if the bosses got a grip on
costs the government should give the ROH more money. As a result a little
extra cash was fleetingly provided, a few industrial practices were
reformed. Then both sides gave up the struggle.
There is a real danger that history will repeat itself. With Mellor, its
arch critic, gone, Covent Garden seems confident enough to ride out the
storm. The Board bowed imperceptibly to the critical wind by renewing
general director Jeremy Isaacs' contract for two rather than three years,
but it dug in its heels on its commitment to the Pounds 250m redevelopment
plan and persuaded the Arts Council to allow it to release a sanitised
version of the Warnock report.
So Warnock seems to be issuing the same old threats - if the ROH does not
clear its debts in three years time, well, awful things will happen. The
Council maintains that this time it is serious and wants heads to roll at
management level as soon as the Board makes its considered response to the
two Reports.
But the odds must be on a few cosmetic changes and the Arts Council
continuing to fund Covent Garden unwillingly with minimal grants. The real
issue was ducked again. It was extraordinary that Warnock did not confront
high seat prices, the cause of most of the antagonism to Covent Garden. They
are excessive because the ROH presents too extensive a programme on too
small a subsidy. Management reforms could save Pounds 1m a year but this is
only equal to the box office receipts of four gala evenings.
The report, or at least the brief summary released to the press, also dodged
the issue of the composition of the board. The alternative report, from
Price Waterhouse, recommended a much broader participation by expert
outsiders. The Lottery, and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, as
potential sources of funding, also failed to get a mention.
Instead the reports got embroiled in the great redevelopment saga. You must
admire Covent Garden's determination to press ahead with a Pounds 250m
commercial project, involving at least two years closure, during an
unprecedented slump in the property market. Perhaps Isaacs does have pledges
for half the Pounds 90m the ROH must provide. If he could announce that,
say, Pounds 50m is in the bag the enterprise becomes viable.
Certainly Covent Garden is becoming the most slummy of the great European
opera houses. But if the recession continues ROH would be well advised to go
for the partial revamping of the back stage facilities, approved by Warnock.
The government (or the Lottery) might well be happy to put up Pounds 10m for
new wiring and some cosmetic front-of-house changes to ensure that the Opera
House has something to offer during the millennium celebrations in 2000.
Brooke could broker a package. A strengthened board and management will
promise to force through industrial changes. If they lead to strikes the
Arts Council would make good any financial loss. No decision on closure will
be made until 1994 when the financial situation could be very different. And
a successor to Isaacs should be appointed soon. After all he, or she, will
have to guide the Opera House though the really traumatic years after 1995.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: A poet much misunderstood - One hundred years after
his death Michael Glover defends Tennyson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'NOTHING could have been more striking than the scene during the last hours.
On the bed a figure of breathing marble, flooded and bathed in the light of
the full moon streaming through the oriel window; his hand clasping the
Shakespeare which he had asked for but recently, and which he had kept by
him to the end; the moonlight, the majestic figure as he lay there, 'drawing
thicker breath', irresistibly brought to minds his own Passing of Arthur.'
This extract from the authorised biography of Alfred Lord Tennyson, who died
100 years ago next week, was written by his son Hallam. 1,The style is
treacly, unctuous, and the details more than a little improbable - but this
was the way in which the Victorian age wanted to regard its pre-eminent
poet.
It is difficult for a sceptical, unpoetical age such as ours to grasp,
intellectually or emotionally, the measure of Tennyson's fame, influence and
wealth during his lifetime, but let one small, practical detail suffice: by
the early 1860s, Tennyson was sufficiently prosperous to be able to refuse
the offer of a reading tour of America which would have guaranteed him a
stipend of Pounds 20,000.
It had not always been so, of course. One of 12 children, he grew up in a
Lincolnshire rectory and his childhood and early manhood were blighted by
family illness. His father was a choleric, embittered man who had never
forgiven his own father for settling the greater part of the family's
inheritance upon his brother Charles, and almost every one of Alfred's
eleven siblings suffered from one disabling disease or another - insanity,
opium addiction, alcoholism, epilepsy or severe mental breakdown. Tennyson,
a sensitive, bookish, reclusive child, suffered profoundly as a result. As
the poet WH Auden once said, 'there was little about melancholia that he
didn't know.'
Freedom of a kind came with his arrival at Trinity, Cambridge in 1827. His
contemporaries included Thackeray and Edward Fitzgerald, but it was the son
of a great Whig historian, Arthur Henry Hallam, with whom he was to develop
the most intense friendship of his life, cut short, tragically, by Hallam's
death of a cerebral haemorrhage in 1832 at the age of 22. Hallam, muse and
shade, appears and reappears in Tennyson's poetry throughout his life.
Tennyson's contemporaries at university recognised immediately that they had
a poet in their midst - by gait, manner and distinctive dress; he recognised
his vocation from the start and stuck to it. He wrote prose of any
description with great reluctance - his surviving letters are almost all
short and to the point; he never wrote a preface, an essay, a review, a
diary, a memoir or even a fragment of autobiography.
And he published his own poems with great reluctance. The first collection,
Poems, Chiefly Lyrical, appeared in 1830, and its mood is that of the
emburdened soul, self-absorbed and thoroughly miserable in the concentrated
way that only youthful poets can be. It is also verbally luscious - a
weakness that his poetry would always tend to suffer from.
For the next two decades he lived a somewhat aimless life. Carlyle
beautifully captures him in 1840: 'A fine, large-featured, dim-eyed,
bronze-coloured, shaggy-headed man . . . who swims, outwardly and inwardly,
with great composure in an inarticulate element of tranquil chaos and
tobacco smoke; great now and then when he does emerge.'
It was the poems of 1842, which included such pieces as The Lady of Shalott,
Ulysses and Godiva, that established him as the outstanding poet of his
generation. But critics were soon to condemn him for failing to respond to
the issues of the day: a the hungry 1840s, the age of Chartism and what
Carlyle piquantly described as 'the Condition-of-England question'.
Tennyson, deeply sensitive to criticism of every kind, listened to these
critics and his later poems do indeed address many of the great public
themes of the Victorian age, starting perhaps with The Princess of 1847,
which tackles the burning issue of female education.
In spite of his gathering fame, Tennyson suffered a prolonged physical
collapse during the 1840s. His financial difficulties were eased by the gift
of a Civil List pension in 1845, but it was not until 1850 that the clouds
finally dispersed. This was the year of In Memoriam, a secretive marriage to
Emily Sellwood which brought stability into his life, and his award of the
Poet Laureateship.
Thereafter, and in spite of the occasional critical lambasting - Maud was
generally regarded as disgusting or 'unintelligible' (Gladstone), though in
our day it has seemed more appropriate to regard it as a forerunner of
Eliot's mood of urban desolation: 'And I loathe the squares and streets,/And
the faces that one meets .,/and my heart is a handful of dust,' - his fame
and influence were universal. He became firm friends with Queen Victoria,
who informed him that, after the Bible, In Memoriam was her greatest source
of comfort; his public poems  - especially the 'Ode on the Death of the Duke
of Wellington', were the anthems of the nation; and his acceptance of the
peerage in 1883 seemed to crown a lifetime of achievements, His funeral in
Wstminster Abbey was a gloriously pompous occasion, though Thomas Hardy
thought it a bit overdone and 'less penetrating than a plain country
internment would have been.'
Then, soon after his virtual apotheosis, the chilly winds of the 20th
century began to blow, and he was effectively knocked off his pedestal.
Auden described him as the stupidest of all English poets. Yet, in more
recent times, we have come to admire aspects of his work - both late and
early - that the creation of a massively imposing public man caused to be
concealed for far too long: a poet, often glimpsed in the shorter lyrics,
who was both introspective and self absorbed. In fact, the very anxious boy
that he had once been.
Two new biographies are published this month to coincide with the centenary
 -one, Tennyson, a short, admirably lucid and beautifully illustrated
account by Norman Page (Allison &amp; Busby Pounds 16.99, 190 pages), is an
excellent introduction to the complexities of Tennyson's life and work; the
other, a longer and more searching enquiry of the same title that bears
comparison with Robert Bernard Martin's excellent biography of 1980, is by
Michael Thorn (Little, Brown Pounds 20, 566 pages), The definitve edition of
his poetry remains the Poems (3 vols., Longman), edited by Christopher
Ricks.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Motoring: Too good for the mud - Range Rover Vogue LSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOULD you walk into your drawing room wearing muddy wellingtons? I thought
not. In which case, having invested Pounds 40,000 on a new Range Rover Vogue
LSE, with its leather-seated and Italian poplar-veneered interior, the last
thing most owners would do is drive it axle-deep in mire.
Here we have a paradox. The two most significant improvements to the 1993
Range Rover are electronic air suspension and traction control. They equip
it to do even better what only a handful of owners ask of it  - which is to
go clambering about on rough terrain.
A clever suspension system depends on an electric compressor to keep the air
at the right pressure in the rubber bags which replace the normal coil
springs. There are five heights. In access mode, the vehicle sinks down on
to its bump stops, making it easier to enter and leave. The next setting
(low profile) is assumed automatically at more than 50 mph (80 kmh) to
improve main road ride and handling.
For driving at modest speed on normal roads, the suspension sets itself to
standard profile. High profile is for off-road use and when fording rivers.
Extended profile is an emergency setting which would be handy should it run
aground on its belly.
Apart from low profile, all the other ride heights are driver-selected by
push button. But should you drive away in access mode, the suspension -
which also keeps the car on an even keel regardless of load - pumps itself
up to standard height automatically.
When I drove a Range Rover Vogue LSE last month, there must have been a leak
somewhere. Every few seconds, the compressor started to refill the
suspension's air reservoir with a heavy breathing noise like an elephant
making an indecent telephone call. But the suspension absorbs the bumps
beautifully and subdues tyre noise although it still has not cured what, to
me, is one of the Range Rover's main drawbacks - its roly-poly restlessness
on winding roads. Although it holds the road well and corners quickly and
securely, its handling is not as car-like as that of a Mitsubishi Shogun or
Isuzu Trooper.
For driving across rough country, the Range Rover is still the one to beat.
The new electronic traction control system uses the same wheel sensors as
the ABS brakes. Whatever grip the tyres have, the driver can make best use
of it.
Exclusive to the Vogue LSE is a 4.2-litre, 200-horsepower development of the
veteran Rover V8 engine, linked to a four-speed automatic transmission. It
provides brisk acceleration, quiet motorway cruising, and enough muscle to
tow trailers of up to four tons.
The official figures suggest an average fuel consumption of about 17 mpg
(16.6 l/100 km) or 300 miles (480km) from an 18-gallon (82 litre) tankful. I
think this might be over-optimistic, especially for motorway driving. I
shall know soon. Next week I am driving a Vogue LSE to Paris for the Mondial
de l'Automobile show at which it makes its public debut alongside the latest
Land Rover Discovery, with its 3.9-litre V8 petrol engine and automatic
transmission. The show also will mark the European debut of the big, new
Chrysler Jeep Grand Cherokee - a Range Rover rival, although Britain will
have to wait until 1994 for right-hand drive versions.
Having sampled the air-suspended Range Rover, I thought the steel-sprung
Discovery automatic would be an anti-climax. In fact, I preferred its feel
and handling on the road. Past experience has proved that, even without
adjustable ride height, it is formidably capable across rough country.
As a single air-suspended, super-luxury LSE (at Pounds 39,995) costs almost
twice as much as a Discovery (from Pounds 19,654), you have to ask if Range
Rover prices have finally gone over the top. Or have they, like the air
suspension at only standard height, still some upward movement left?

FT  03 OCT 92 / Gardening: Teaching the apple to eat its own worm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE fruit world, the emphasis on pest and disease control is changing
from reliance on chemicals to breeding natural resistance into plants so
they need to be sprayed less often or, preferably, not at all. This I learnt
during a visit to the Institute of Horticultural Research at East Malling,
Kent, the leading fruit research station in Britain.
Some of the progress made is based on work that started a long time ago, the
full potential of which was not realised until the recent disillusionment
with the long-term effectiveness of chemicals and their effects on the
environment.
Thirty years ago, for example, Dr Ray Watkins was beginning to look for new
apple tree root stocks which, in addition to restricting the growth of the
apple varieties grafted on them, would also be resistant to woolly aphid and
crown rot. It would also give a better uptake of calcium which would improve
crop storage.
These new root stocks were collectively known under the letters AR to
distinguish them from the MM root stocks raised at East Malling. Little has
been heard of them and I do not think that any AR root stock has been
released for commercial use. However, this is likely to change for much new
breeding is going on and some of the results look promising. One AR root
stock has already been identified which could provide a replacement for the
much-used MM106.
It was at East Malling that the self-pruning, columnar apple trees - some
are marketed as Ballerina apple trees - were produced. The breeding work
continues and one red-fruited variety, Teleman, looks particularly
promising. There is also a search for resistance to scab disease and mildew.
Efforts are being made to ensure regular bearing by a method which is new to
me. This is based on belief that it is the production of seeds that really
puts a strain on the apple trees, reducing the production of fruit buds for
the following year. Some apple varieties, such as Wellington Bloomless and
Spencers Seedless, can produce fruit without seeds and some columnar trees
with this characteristic are on trial at East Malling.
Another approach to regular cropping in apples is to produce varieties with
flowers that are tolerant to frost or those which produce pollen which will
fertilise at quite low temperatures. One such variety, Falstaff, is already
on the market and doing well. It is a regular cropper and an excellent
pollenator for other varieties including Fiesta, another fine East Malling
introduction. Falstaff also has the merit of being self fertile.
Both Fiesta and Falstaff figure prominently in current East Malling apple
breeding because of their commercial success. To give some idea of the scale
of breeding that is necessary to get results quickly, 30,000 seedlings from
these and other varieties have been produced. Of these 1,500 have been
selected for fruiting and 10 have gone on to the national food trials at
Brogdale, Faversham, Kent.
The search for resistance to scab disease and mildew continues. So far the
most promising seedling has Fiesta as one of its parents, the other being an
unnamed seedling selected at East Malling for its high resistance to both
these diseases. It is hoped that in about 10 years the scab-free commercial
apple will be a reality. Even resistance to apple canker, troublesome on
some varieties, is being investigated. Breeders will say no more than that
sources of resistance to this most intractable of diseases have been
located.
Similar work is being done with pears and an improvement in the popular
Concord, which was bred at East Malling, is being sought. Again, attention
is being given to disease resistance, most particularly to fireblight which,
when it occurs, means the destruction of affected trees.
Strawberries are an important crop at East Malling and here again high
priority is being given to improvement in pest and disease resistance,
notably to verticillium wilt, powdery mildew and the two-spotted mite.
Pegasus is an example of a recent introduction with a useful level of
resistance both to verticillium wilt and to crown rot. It is said to grow
well on heavy soils. Calypso, which is not yet available to home gardeners,
is an everbearing strawberry with fruits that are less susceptible to mildew
than those of Rapello, the variety it most closely resembles. Unfortunately
its leaves are susceptible so it must be sprayed.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Fashion: Hemlines, it's a long story - Lucia van der Post
discovers how to wear this season's hot new skirt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   IN BETWEEN worrying about the big issues
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the ERM, mortgage rates, unemployment . . . you know the sort of thing -
what is really creasing the fashionable woman's brow this autumn is: will
she or won't she take to the longer skirt?
On catwalks, in store windows, in glossy magazines and snazzy boutiques the
long skirt reigns (nearly) supreme. But wander round the stores, go to a
chic little gathering or to a private dinner party and what is everybody
wearing? Curvy little suits with snappy short skirts, that's what. And if
they are not wearing curvy little suits they are more than likely wearing
trousers.
Part of the problem seems to be that few people are sure how to wear long
skirts. After the sassy, sexy short skirt which we had all learned how to
wear (opaque tights and pumps were all it really needed) the long skirt
seems fraught with perils. It can so easily look dowdy and frumpy.
Suzie Faux, who runs the tres tres chic Wardrobe boutiques and is a dab hand
at transforming the most frumpish of customers, believes that almost
everybody can wear the new long look. 'It just needs careful attention to
the legs - the skirt should never stop where the leg is at its fattest. On
some people the best length will be near the ankle, on others a little below
the knee. There is no substitute for trying them on and experimenting with
lengths and with jackets. I have found that most of my customers look best
with a belted jacket that covers the bottom. It must on no account be
skimpy. It also needs the right shoe - Robert Clergerie does a wonderful
shoe, Samba, which has a platform heel so tiny that it is more like a double
sole. It looks perfect.'
This year's long skirt should be soft, flowing and very feminine. Many of
the best come tied sarong-style at the side or with slits, allowing - but
decorously - quite a lot of leg to show. After all, nobody wants to waste
the effects of all those aerobics classes.
This week the fashion page talks to some women about town who have already
decided that they won't be without a long skirt this autumn . . .
DONNING a long skirt means more than just a change of hemline - it means a
complete change of mood. If it is not to look dowdy or ageing then a real
touch of glamour is required. Think of all those goddesses of the silver
screen and you will get the drift. The no-make-up face has gone, the bare
nails, the cropped hair - in their place are defined eyebrows, deep-set
eyes, full lips, painted nails, full hair. It is good news for the make-up
houses which have cashed in on the mood and brought out strong new ranges to
help customers create the right look. In cosmetic-house-speak the look for
the winter requires 'smokey, smouldering eyes' and 'very coloured lips.' You
can't go wrong if you remember to think glamour, glamour, glamour.
                         *      *      *
JENNY HALPERN, above, who runs the fashion public relations for Joseph is
photographed here in her favourite long skirt - a side split suede version -
but already she feels that somehow 'it does not seem fashionable to wear a
short skirt.'
She finds the new length not so practical for work and worries that the sexy
split on the side might be thought provocative, so she still tends to stick
to leggings for every day. However, whenever she feels the need to dress up
a little she dons one or other of her clutch of long skirts - either the
suede one or a tiger print version with a side split or a long knitted
Tricot skirt which has a slit up the back.
For the evening Jenny puts the split in the middle and during the day she
wears it at the side. She wears the skirt very simply with an Equipment
shirt or a long top. On her feet she wears Sartore low-heeled knee-high
boots and if she were to wear shoes they would have to be high with a chunky
heel.
Jenny is not throwing away her short skirts but she has definitely set them
aside for the moment. 'It is time for a different philosophy of dressing,
for thinking about fashion in a new way.'
                         *      *      *
LADY DAVINA ALEXANDER, who runs her own business as a special events
consultant to a number of upper-crust companies such as Chaumet, the
jewellers, and Charles Heidsieck, needs to have clothes to dress the part.
'I used to have to look smart just occasionally during the day and in the
evenings when we were going out, but now I'm in a business where I need to
look fashionable almost all the time. I suddenly felt that all my existing
clothes were obsolete so I thought I ought to try the new longer look. I was
worried that I wasn't tall enough but I started trying things on and
experimenting with jacket shapes and I think that it can be made to work.
'I have to say I'm still experimenting with it - I am not entirely convinced
yet. One of the problems is that it needs a whole new wardrobe of shoes. It
needs a thicker, chunkier heel and I am just going to have to go out and buy
them.'
                         *      *      *
JINNI Featherstone-Witty, left, works for Kleinwort Benson in the treasury
division and spends most of her day in a world of men. She hates shopping
and finds that trying to look appropriately dressed in a business sense and
to be fashionable at the same time is a challenge. She likes Laura
Benjamin's shop off Walton Street because 'I am not a standard shape and
Laura will take that into account.
'I am keener on the new long look this time round - it is more feminine and
more flexible and though I am worried about covering up one of my assets -
my legs - I still think they can be made to look very attractive. I notice
in the City that women are beginning to wear them and I think as soon as the
weather gets colder we will see many more. I travel a lot and need clothes
that pack and can look good. I always kept some skirts that were on the knee
rather than above it as they were so much easier for travelling. I think the
new look is very helpful for people like me who need a look that is both
fashionable and suitable for office life.'
                         *      *      *
EDWINA WILLIS-FLEMING is manageress of the Loewe shop and being nearly 6 ft
tall with the kind of figure that would look good in a potato sack she has
been able to don the new long length without any of her shorter sisters'
qualms.
She is wearing long skirts partly because they are in fashion, partly
because they make a change from short and partly because she finds them very
elegant and easy to wear. She thinks it 'has brought a much-needed breath of
fresh air to the fashion business. Depending on how they are worn, they can
have huge sex appeal. So much more is left to the imagination, which is
always more beguiling.'
She finds them very versatile. By day she wears them with a ribbed polo
neck, a pair of ankle boots and opaque tights. At night she would choose
something with a slit at the front with high heels, perhaps with slight
platforms, and sheer tights.
She also thinks it needs careful accessorising and she chose pieces, like
the choker, which work with what she calls 'the modern, classic forties
look.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / Sport: Cowboys ride high once more - American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Christmas Eve, 1989, a hopeless Dallas Cowboys team crept out of Texas
Stadium following the final home defeat of a season in which they won just
one out of 16 games. Despairing Texans sought solace in a joke about Tom
Landry, the legendary Cowboys head coach who had been unceremoniously sacked
the year before.
'Landry,' they said, 'wanted to get as far away from pro football as he
could this season - so he came to Texas Stadium.'
The club which had been known during coach Landry's great years in the 1970s
and early 1980s as 'America's Team', had become the butt of most of the bad
jokes in professional football.
Less than three years later, the Cowboys face the Philadelphia Eagles on
Monday night in a game that matches two genuine Super Bowl contenders, and
no one is cracking jokes about the team from Dallas anymore.
If the Cowboys go on to win the Super Bowl this year (and judging by their
performances so far, there are plenty of reasons to suspect they can), it
will be the shortest rags-to-riches story in the history of the National
Football League.
After their feeble single-win season in 1989, the Cowboys improved rapidly.
In 1990 they won seven out of 16. Last year they won 11 and reached the
play-offs, where they went out in the second round to Detroit.
They have already won their first three games of 1992, including impressive
victories over the two most recent Super Bowl champions, the Washington
Redskins and New York Giants. If they beat Philadelphia on Monday night, the
odds on a Cowboys championship will shorten considerably.
That Dallas has come so far, and so quickly, is a testament to the work of
two men: Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones, and head coach Jimmy Johnson.
When the Arkansas-born Jones bought the Cowboys in February 1989, he earned
the immediate enmity of Texans everywhere by sacking Landry who had led the
Cowboys for their first 29 years and taken them to five Super Bowls, and
ousting Tex Schramm, the club president and the only other Texan more
revered than Landry.
Although the first season was a disaster, it provided the new owner and
coach with the opportunity to dismantle the team and start over again. From
the summer of 1990 on, Jones and Johnson set about rebuilding the franchise
from scratch in an unprecedented burst of activity that involved big trades,
rapid contract signings and astute use of the draft system that brings
college players into the pros.
The most dramatic move was the first. In October 1989 the Cowboys' one true
star player, the running back Herschel Walker, was traded to the Minnesota
Vikings in exchange for five players and seven picks in future college
drafts.
Jones said recently: 'I didn't really have a timetable when I got here in
1989, but I had a commitment to use every avenue to upgrade the talent, even
if it meant sacrificing a win or two.'
At the time Jones and Johnson were vilified for the trade, but it has since
proved to be one of the most one-sided deals in the history of American
sports. Walker had a disastrous time in Minnesota, and he is now trying to
rebuild his shattered career at Philadelphia (which should add some extra
spice to Monday night's game).
Johnson has said: 'If we were concerned about respectability that first
year, we would have kept Walker . . . and tried to win two or three extra
games. But that wasn't going to get us to the Super Bowl.'
Among the players Dallas eventually got as part of that deal were running
back Emmitt Smith, defensive tackle Russell Maryland, one of the
heavyweights in the defensive line, and Kevin Smith who plays cornerback,
defending against the other team's wide receivers. The three players now
form part of the foundations for a championship team. While Maryland has the
potential to be a great player, The powerful, fast Emmitt Smith has already
achieved that status. Last year he was the best running back in the NFL,
with 1,563 yards to his credit. With wide receiver Michael Irvin, who gained
more yards catching passes than any other player in the league last year,
and the young quarterback Troy Aikman, the Cowboys have one of the most
potent air and ground attacks in football today.
After the Walker trade, the Cowboys picked up the pace. In 1990 they signed
a record 16 free agents (players without contracts). The following year all
17 of the team's draft choices were under contract by the time the 1991
season started, and a back-up quarterback, Steve Beuerlein, was acquired
from the Los Angeles Raiders.
Dallas have orchestrated an astonishing 42 trades in the last three years,
and why they try not to waste time signing a free agent or gambling on a
college draftee.
'Whatever we need, we make an effort to get, and we don't have to go through
a committee to get permission,' said Jones.
Last year, the Cowboys made four top draft picks, all of them defenders
brought in to shore up what was perceived to be the team's biggest weakness
 -an inability to defend effectively against opponents who pass much more
than they run.
The final piece in what could be the Cowboys' Super Bowl puzzle appeared
this summer, when Dallas picked up Charles Haley from San Francisco. Haley
is an intimidating defensive player expert at disrupting opposing
quarterback's pass plays. More importantly, he is a natural leader, an
essential commodity on the youngest team in the NFL (average age: 25). With
the players in place, coach Johnson has designed a playbook built to exploit
the team's two strengths: speed, and skill. In doing so, he is trying to
break the mould of power football that has traditionally dominated their NFC
East division.
After a solid start last year, the Cowboys reached the playoffs on the back
of a five-game winning streak built on three characteristics: an ability to
'make the big play'; an ability to score consistently when inside the
opponents' 20-year line; and an ability to avoid mistakes. Add these
qualities to the calibre of the top players, the youthful enthusiasm of the
squad, and Johnson's intelligent coaching, and Dallas has all the
ingredients for a Super Bowl year.
Conventional wisdom in the NFL has it that teams should pay their dues
before winning a Super Bowl (ie, spend at least half a decade rebuilding).
Yet the owner of the Cowboys believes they are ready for the title this
year.
As Jerry Jones has said over and over again this season: 'Why not us? Why
not now?' Why not indeed.

FT  03 OCT 92 / As They Say in Europe: Germany hits back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Die Welt captured the spirit of the week in Anglo-German relations: 'The
Bundesbank cannot allow British politicians to fabricate the myth that the
pound was brought to its knees by a German throw of the dice . . .the
Bundesbank spent billions to support the sickly pound. It was no use because
the British economy was in too bad a state. In fact, it was the English
themselves who sold their money for harder currency, because they were
realists, unlike their government . . .'
Until the FT published the Bundesbank's disrespectful comments on UK
financial strategy, things seemed to be settling down in Europe. The British
had friends: close ones, too. La Presse de la Manche (or Channel-Press)
serves a region where most people voted No in the referendum and the clean,
fresh wind blows in from England.
It wrote: 'John Major, above all, does not want to break the thread that
links him to the Continent; he knows the future of his country is in Europe.
That is what the French people basically voted for on September 20. Yes to
Europe but not to any old Europe, and a Europe where each state will feel at
home . . . preserving its culture but open to all. It may be that John Major
is right and that he is a good European.'
So, for a brief moment, many were ready to accept the virtues of others. Too
many, according to Alberto Recarte, 'a commercial official of the state'
writing in El Pais.
He argued against a view that is gaining ground in Madrid. ' . . . many
Spanish politicians think the Italian model is not so bad. When all is said
and done, Italy has only had to devalue, leave the ERM and become an example
not to be followed. If that were the sole price to pay, I would be with the
'Italianisers' - any policy is better than importing the deflation of recent
years.' But he decided the Italians had got away with it for so long because
they had a trade surplus, unlike Spain.
The Germans may have thought they were taking other people's arguments
seriously when they cancelled the official celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of the V-2 rocket. The press had been opposed to the project and
Sudkurier welcomed the change of heart: 'The public outcry of indignation
remains. That should alarm us all.
'However, what we saw was not a new nationalism but a brutal loss of memory,
and of a sense of history which is seamlessly linked to the fire attacks on
refugee asylums and even to justifications for the Third Reich. That is a
picture of Germany nobody can be proud of.'
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung managed to pull a number of issues
together and, unwittingly, foreshadowed the deepening crisis in writing
about the V-2 affair. 'The circumstances in this case strike at Anglo-German
relations which, in recent months, have suffered a number of blows.
'At present nothing works, one accident after another with both sides
tumbling over themselves to upset the other. Everything in German foreign
policy - and no less in British - can work only on the basis of close
co-operation which also includes France and America . . . The restructuring
of a defensive alliance into an alliance for reconstruction has not
succeeded. The restoration of Germany and the return of the Germans as one
of the great nations of Europe has led to a collapse of solidarity.'
IT SEEMS you need nerves of steel to run local government in Spain. The
Heraldo de Aragon reported on the municipal finances of the regional
capital. The city of Zaragoza borrowed SFr160m three years ago, so that debt
has now risen by Pta1.2bn as a result of the devaluation.
But, the paper continued: 'This debt, according to city officials, is
compensated by the profits obtained in previous years which had been made by
changing assets into dollars and marks at favourable moments.' It also noted
that the city authorities had made this year's debt payments a mere 10 days
before the peseta was devalued.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Despatches: Farcical skirmish in a niggling, weary little
war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Saturday, my family and I were victims of what the police report
described as an 'act of hostility against Israel.' It was likely, added the
report, that it was carried out by 'a hostile organisation' or 'foreign
military forces' or 'infiltrators.' The Israeli government is going to pay
for the 'war damage.'
None of us - my wife, myself and our three small children - was hurt or even
threatened with injury. Only our car was smashed up by a gang of Palestinian
likely lads, and we were not in it.
It was as far removed from a real war as you could imagine. But it tells you
much about the weary impasse that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has
reached and, perhaps, a little of the reason why the two sides are now
engaged more deeply in peace talks than ever before.
Here is what happened to us.
Some time between the Weetabix and the day's first cry of 'Mummy, I'm
bored,' my wife and I decided the 4 1/2 -year-old Palestinian uprising in
the occupied territories had subsided enough for us to feel confident about
a family outing to the West Bank town of Hebron, about 20 miles south of our
home in Jerusalem.
With specially-installed strong plastic windows, a Palestinian keffiyeh
scarf displayed prominently and a 'foreign press' sticker on the windscreen,
we reckoned we were insulated well enough against the occasional intifada
rock-thrower out to hit cars bearing the giveaway yellow Israeli licence
plates.
Our judgment seemed justified. We spent a couple of happy hours visiting the
Hebron souk (camel heads hanging outside butchers' stalls a speciality) and
a local glass blowing factory, and the locals gave us the warmest of
welcomes. But on the way back, just before Bethlehem, we turned off the main
road to visit Solomon's pools, ancient reservoirs set in attractive
countryside which used to supply Jerusalem's water. We parked in the shade
of a tree and went off for a walk, ignoring the several groups of young men
milling about the pools.
As we were enthusing about the pleasures of tension-free sightseeing in the
West Bank, a nice young fellow approached us. 'Is your car up there?' he
asked, pointing to where we had parked. When I said yes, he told us: 'Some
boys - they are . . .' He waved his arms up and down and made ominous
crunching noises. 'You must hurry,' he added.
I needn't have bothered; the deed was well done by then. The reinforced
windscreen had been smashed by a rock the size of my head while the doors
had been sprung open and some interior panels ripped off.
The outside had been given a good kicking, some of the lights were crunched,
and the car had been heaved backwards into thick bushes. What little was
inside had gone, including the keffiyeh.
As I cursed my stupidity, an old Fiat pulled up. Two young men, bearded in
the fashion of Hamas, the Palestinian fundamentalist group, looked at me
with an air of amused satisfaction. But as they heard me speak, there was a
frown of doubt.
'You are Jewish?' the driver asked.
'No, I'm British.'
'Oh,' he said. He conferred with his friend. 'Would you like us to help?' he
offered with what I thought was rather a contrived air of innocence.
Suddenly, the car was surrounded by shebab - young men - all absurdly
solicitous, the more so when they saw blonde-haired Fred, Hannah and Patrick
arrive on the scene. 'Smash car?' asked two-year-old Patrick, clearly pained
that he had not been able to join in the fun.
'Blimey, guv, who would do such a terrible thing?' is a rough translation of
what the shebab said as they helped clear up some of the mess they obviously
had created moments before. They beamed happily at the camera as my wife
took souvenir photos.
To the Israeli police in their fortified station in Bethlehem's Manger
Square, just across the street from the Church of the Nativity, ours was a
tiresomely routine case. They seemed relieved not to find any fingerprints.
Just give a statement, sign the forms for compensation for the repairs, and
you can go home. 'Next time you come, don't go to Solomon's pools,' said
officer Yossi Cohen. 'Just come and drink coffee with us.'
Of course, it is a mistake to read too much into an event like this. There
are, after all, still people getting killed in the intifada. If you are a
Palestinian in a refugee camp under curfew, it is no laughing matter. Nor is
it a joke for Israeli soldiers patrolling those refugee camps. But I cannot
help feeling that what happened to us last Saturday was a sign of how
cynical resignation has set in on both sides.
The Palestinians, hopelessly outgunned, have proved unable (or unwilling) to
mount a sustained IRA-style campaign of ruthless, sophisticated violence
that might have dislodged Israel from the occupied territories. Our friends
at Solomon's pools were hardly of the SAS image conjured up by the official
label of 'foreign military force.' Yet, they were part of the stubborn,
niggling refusal to accept Israeli rule that has made Israelis realise they
can stay in the West Bank only under hostile conditions.
Each side keeps up the rhetoric of a war - but each side knows it cannot
win. So now, at last, they are talking peace instead.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Sport: Play like a woman - Golf / John Hopkins offers some
advice to male golfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW years ago Laura Davies was playing in a pro-am in Palm Springs,
California. The members of her team were all men and she worked hard to help
them judge distances, select clubs and read putts. There was a lot of
laughter and lively conversation from the group who were nearly all English.
The main aim of Davies's team was to combine well and win one of the
handsome prizes that were on offer. It soon became clear, however, that
there was another competition going on. It was the battle of the sexes. The
aim in this competition was to outdrive Laura.
One player became almost a caricature of the type I shall christen 'The Man
whose Masculinity is at Stake'. His eyes bulged with concentration. He
gripped the club so tightly that the muscles in his forearms stood out. He
stopped at nothing to do the ball a mischief.
It was hopelessly one-sided. Davies, the biggest hitter ever in women's
golf, once drove a ball 340 yards and regularly drives 260 yards. Few men
can compete with her in this department and, frankly, it is pointless to
try.
But that is not to say there is nothing to be gained from watching women's
professional golf. The opposite is the case. Most men amateurs can learn far
more from watching a women professional golfer than from her male equivalent
because the game of the average player has much more in common with that of
women professionals than with that of Seve Ballesteros. So the text for this
morning is this: why can't a man be more like a woman?
Women professional golfers are prey to the same self-doubts that plague men.
You do not like fast downhill putts? Neither do they. You find long bunker
shots hard? So do they. Worried about shanking the occasional chip? So are
they.
Men are reluctant to admire or learn from anything that is not male. They
dress in their Nick Faldo shirts, with their Ballesteros rainsuit in their
bags, tee up their two-piece high compression ball and stand on the first
tee of a monthly medal hoping they won't make a complete hash of things.
Faldo does not have the same fears and nor does Ian Woosnam. But many women
professionals do.
'I know that when I am playing a downhill chip from a bare lie I am saying
to myself: 'Keep your head still. Don't make a fool of yourself,'' says
Kitrina Douglas, a member of Europe's Solheim Cup team which is competing
against the Americans at Dalmahoy, Edinburgh, this weekend.
A golfing partner of my father's remarked, tongue in cheek, last week: 'I
like watching the women play golf because I like to see their figures and
look at their legs but what I really like to watch is the rhythm with which
they play golf.'
This is the most obvious area in which men can learn from the women. Women
have to acquire good rhythm because that is more than half the secret of
hitting the ball any distance. This lesson was brought home to me when I
played in a pro-am with Douglas. Bad weather restricted us to nine holes but
this was long enough for her to demonstrate the repetitive rhythm of her
swing and her remarkable accuracy. After about six holes of watching this, a
funny thing happened to me. I started swinging more slowly, too. And sure
enough, I hit the ball better and further.
Another area where men can improve is in their attention to the short game.
Men practice their long game, if they practice at all. Women do not ignore
this department but they do not concentrate on it at the expense of their
short game. 'When men practice they practice hitting their drives as far as
they can' says Davies. 'They think they miss a lot of full shots. But if
they think about it I reckon that nine times out of ten if they miss the
green they do not get up and down. They need to work on their short games.
All amateurs are let down by their short game.'
Helen Wadsworth is in her second season as a professional on the European
tour and already she has noticed some characteristics among the men who play
with her in pro-ams. The first is their tendency to underclub and to talk
about their own game. The second is their inability to accept advice.
Bertie Wooster was once moved to remark: 'Women, the way I looked at it,
simply couldn't do . . . what a crew] What a crew] I mean to say, what a
crew]' I beg to differ. Women are there to be learned from, however hard it
is for the male ego to accept this. If you do not believe me then go to
Dalmahoy today or tomorrow and see for yourself. You will be all the better
for it. And your golf will improve, too.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Sport: New package, same old product - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH soccer's top division has a new brand name and a new logo, but just
six weeks into the FA Premier League's first season it is clear that the
product has not improved. The league has changed the colour of the referees'
shirts and added five minutes to half-time, but, for the most part, can
offer only the same teams serving the same rubbish. Away from the grounds,
television is awash with mediocre football and the back pages of Britain's
newspapers are dominated by the squabbles of club chairmen.
The chairmen are not arguing about how to play football but about money and
power. The greatest irritant is television. Successive rounds of TV contract
negotiations have left a legacy of anger, suspicion and resentment.
The Premier League has its roots in the TV negotiations of 1988. The biggest
clubs threatened to break away and take their ratings with them if the
league did not sign the deal with ITV that they favoured. The top clubs won,
but remained unhappy about subsidising their poorer brethren. Finally, the
rich staged their revolution against the poor last year when the first
division broke free of the other three.
The medium-sized Premier League clubs believe that the ITV deal worked
against them. ITV concentrated on the 'Big Five' clubs which had supported
them, bestowing on them the generous 'facilities fees' the deal contained
and allowing them to cash in on the exposure gained through perimeter
advertising - worth up to Pounds 80,000 for one live game - and generous
contracts from sponsors and kit makers eager to share that exposure.
Ken Bates, chairman of Chelsea, accuses ITV of having a 'blacklist' of clubs
which voted against its offer. Ron Noades, chairman of Crystal Palace, says
he used to start each season Pounds 1.5m down on the top clubs. 'I can
swallow lower gate receipts and merchandising revenue, but the big clubs
were using money to which they had no moral right to fleece us.'
In May the Premier League clubs accepted a five-year deal from BSkyB, the
satellite broadcaster, with the BBC tagging along. It guaranteed Pounds 200m
over five years: Pounds 40m a year for 60 live games on satellite plus
highlights on BBC. ITV bid Pounds 30m-a-year for 30 live matches and had
indicated it would go higher.
'It was a revenge vote,' says David Dein, vice-chairman of Arsenal. Noades
says: 'I wanted a partner. I was not so interested in the best offer.'
The contract was cunningly constructed by BSkyB. It guarantees every club
live games which bring with them Pounds 60,000 'facilities fees.' But
BSkyB's audience is tiny compared with the terrestrial channels. Its sports
channel has just over 1m subscribers, its rivals reach 25m homes. The
terrestrial channels have hit back with live matches from the old second
division and the Italian first.
The big clubs are unhappy. Dein says: 'We have got over-exposure of soccer
on television. We have gone down a branchline and left the mainline free for
others. Football could suffer from over-exposure.'
The smaller audiences have hurt perimeter advertising, down to around Pounds
5,000 for a live match, and threatens sponsorship revenue. Perimeter
advertising united the dissidents and sponsorship gave them the chance to
exact their revenge. In September, eight clubs which had united in the
'Platinum group' to sell perimeter advertising were the only eight to vote
against a Pounds 3m sponsorship offer by brewers Bass. Under the Premier
League constitution, eight votes are enough to block any proposal.
Behind the disputes there is a difference in the vision of the league.
Bates says: 'The whole concept of the league was to create an elite away
from the candyfloss - a league which would give you strength in depth
unparalleled in the rest of the world.'
But strength in depth is no good to the top clubs, which want to be able to
match Europe's elite: AC Milan and Marseille in the increasingly lucrative
and time-consuming European competitions.
But these goals are often lost behind the grudges. Parry asks forlornly:
'Why are we talking about stuffing people over several thousand pounds?'
'There are a lot more important things in football than arguing about Bass
sponsorship,' says Noades. 'We ought to be talking about the quality of the
football.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / Travel: Mexico's Chichen Itza - 'Fantastico, no?' / In the
Yucatan, Nicholas Woodsworth tackles Mayan maths and astronomy and takes a
turn around the square in Merida
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

'Now this,' said Senor Gomez pointing, 'is called El Castillo in Spanish. It
means the castle. But it is not a castle. It is a highly accurate
multi-purpose calendar.'
WE TURNED in the direction he indicated, but saw neither a castle nor a
calendar. Instead, set in the middle of a vast grassy area where guided
tourist groups scurried to and fro, we saw a broad terraced pyramid rising
75ft into the air. Built of grey stone, it was the exact colour of the heavy
storm clouds that hung in the sky behind it.
On each of its four sides a steep flight of steps led up to a flat-topped
temple at its summit. Like ants on an antheap, the stairs and temple-top
were crawling with hundreds of figures dressed in bright red-and-yellow
nylon rain-jackets. Rain threatened.
Our own party was a large, mixed group - mostly German, Italian and Japanese
 -and few of us had an easy command of English. But this did not stop Senor
Gomez from delivering his guided commentary in a succession of rapid, jerky
bursts that left little time for reflection on what it all might mean. This,
after all, was a busy day at Chichen Itza, the most famous of the Yucatan's
Maya Indian ruins, and it looked as if the weather might break at any
minute.
'Now why do I say El Castillo is a multi-purpose calendar?'
A Japanese lady lifted a video camera to her eye and began filming him.
'Well, the Mayas were very interested in measuring time. There are 91 steps
on each of the four faces of the pyramid. That makes 364. Add one more for
the platform at the top and that makes 365, the exact number of days in one
year.' He beamed at us as if this explained it all. But there was more.
'Also, the staircases on each of the pyramid's nine levels show the 18
months of the Maya solar year, and the 52 panels on each side show the
52-year periods of the Maya calendar cycle.' Senor Gomez was getting into
his stride.
'How did the Mayas combine their ritual calendar of 260 days and their solar
calendar of 365 days so the same calculations were possible on both? Easy -
they found a common divisor. Both numbers are divisible by five. By
multiplying five times 52 cycles of 365 days by 73 cycles of 260 days, they
obtained 18,980 days, or 52 years, permitting perfect computations within
the Maya 52-year calendar cycle.'
We stared at him, speechless.
'Fantastico, no?'
Senor Gomez glared around him, as if waiting to be challenged on the clarity
of his explanation. Nobody challenged him. The Japanese lady stopped
filming. 'Say again,' she said.
'No time,' shouted Senor Gomez over his shoulder as he strode off across the
grass, perspiring in the warm and muggy air. 'Now follow me to the Ball
Court. It is a very interesting game. Under Maya rules, the captain of the
team that won was sacrificed to the gods. It was a great honour. Funny, no?
Come. I have many, many things to show you.'
I had had enough and wandered off to climb El Castillo. A puffing 91 steps
later, I was standing on the top and looking out over the endless, dull
green, table-flat jungle of the Yucatan peninsula.
How odd that in the midst of this great expanse of nothing a people more
than 1,000 years ago should have built great cities. How much odder that
they developed a high theocratic culture with advanced mathematics and
astronomy at its pinnacle.
It was scarcely surprising, I thought, that in a tour lasting barely two
hours Senor Gomez found himself hard put to explain the complexities of
Mayan civilisation. Its subtle yet exacting combination of science and
spirituality has baffled trained minds ever since ruined cities began
re-emerging from the Yucatan jungles a century ago. Together, Mayan culture
and Senor Gomez had certainly baffled my mind.
But the complexities of pre-history have not stopped Yucatan from becoming
one of the most popular regions for visitors to Mexico today. Almost
everyone who comes to the peninsula that divides the Caribbean from the Gulf
of Mexico is attracted by the lure of the ancient Mayas. They end up
enjoying it not just for the ruins of the Mayas of the past  - which tend to
be over-crowded, commercialised and difficult to understand - but for a
special atmosphere created by the Mayas of the present.
Rain began to splatter in heavy, warm drops. Straggling crowds streamed
through acres of monuments to seek shelter in refreshment stands and tour
coaches. On the way home to our hotels, a long, dreary drive through low
tropical bushland, the rain continued to fall in heavy sheets. By the time
we reached Merida some two hours later, water had flooded the narrow streets
of the town, stalled cars at intersections, and was lapping over the
sidewalks.
Unable to stir out, I spent the afternoon watching the rain fall onto the
lush vegetation of the inner courtyard garden of the Grande Hotel. A long,
cool drink at hand, I lay back in a rattan-woven planter's chair, the kind
in which colonials in every tropical outpost from Calcutta to Kumasi have
taken their ease. Surrounded by pillastered columns, etched-glass windows,
tropical hardwood furniture and slowly-whirling fans, I felt like a Merida
sisal king.
In the mid-1850s, some 300 years after the Spanish conquistadors had
virtually enslaved the Mayas, Spanish landowners discovered sisal. Used for
making rope and matting, the fibre found a ready market in Europe and the
US. By the late 19th century, the great plantation owners had made Merida a
gracious colonial city boasting more millionaires per capita than any other
in the world.
They sent their children to the best schools in Europe, imported treasures
from all over the world, and led the luxurious life of an aristocracy. To
the baroque cathedrals, governors' palaces and colonial plazas built by
earlier generations of Spaniards in Merida, they added scores of
French-inspired mansions and the Paseo Montejo - a miniature Champs Elysees.
The boom in sisal is long over but Merida's traditions and independent
spirit, like its architecture, food, music and language, remain. For
centuries Yucatecans have lived isolated lives on their southern peninsula.
Cut off from the rest of the country by vast swamps and jungles, they have
always been a group apart, and proud of it.
And what of those Yucatecans who are descended from the builders of the
pyramids? Present-day Mayas - many of them remain pure-blooded - may have
lost political independence and the ability to calculate precise dates 90m
years in advance, but they remain gentle, intelligent, good-humoured people.
To anyone coming from other large Mexican cities where traditional machismo
is so much part of the culture, Merida's 500,000 inhabitants seem an
unusually relaxed and friendly lot.
By the time darkness fell, the rain had stopped, the streets had dried, and
I was able to venture out for that favourite Merida past-time, the evening
paseo. Crowds of strollers had gathered on the Plaza Mayor, and Christmas,
only days away, had brought to the square a special atmosphere.
Trees, lamp-standards and statues were festooned with coloured lights and
paper. At wheeled streetside stalls, dark-haired women in embroidered
blouses were selling snacks of fried plantain, roasted corn and refreshing
glasses of sweet, almond-flavoured horchata. From long poles balanced on
their shoulders, ambulating hawkers sold children's toys: balloons, horns,
masks and flutes. Dressed in their holiday best, enormous families piled
into horse-drawn carriages for an idle tour of the town.
There was no lack of entertainment. Outside the door of the Grande Hotel, a
sidewalk marimba band was floating hot Latin rhythms out into the night. Up
the street in the cathedral, a choir was singing Mozart's Requiem. And on
the square itself, tiny children with dark, bright eyes were re-enacting the
Nativity. In 80'F heat, four-year-old Wise Men in silver paper crowns and
cotton-wool beards led a sad-looking Mexican donkey loaded with gifts to a
manger in a mock-up Bethlehem.
But I contented myself with just a turn or two around the square. I had work
to do. By my bedside table lay a complex tome by the learned Prof Demitrio
Morales. Its title: The Maya World. Tomorrow I would be visiting Uxmal,
another of the Yucatan's great archaeological sites. I was determined this
time, with the professor's help, not to be taken by surprise by a certain
Senor Gomez.
There are no direct flights between the UK and Mexico. Nicholas Woodsworth
flew to Yucatan with American Airlines (London tel: 081-572-5555), which
flies via Miami to the Yucatan resort city of Cancun. Car hire in Mexico is
expensive - about Dollars 80 a day - but many local companies organise tours
of Mayan archaeological sites.
The best time to visit Yucatan is between September and April, when rainfall
is at its lowest. Expect, nonetheless, a warm and humid tropical climate,
and take rainwear.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Travel: Lecce's wild baroque - Ian Thomson visits the
Florence of southern Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER is in short supply in Lecce, a province situated in the heel of the
Italian boot. Rainfall is so light that Horace honoured the region with the
epithet siticulosae - thirsty. To combat the dryness you might sample a
glass of Malvasia di Lecce, a sparkling (and apparently explosive) white
wine.
Mooching around Apulia, the author Osbert Sitwell related how a bottle of
this wine was uncorked with 'immense noise, as of a mine being exploded,
while a torrent of sparkling liquid splashed like a golden fountain over a
passing lorry. It was like the launching of a battleship; the hubbub was
indescribable . . .'
I suppose the best place in which to sample this wine is Lecce itself, the
Apulian town after which it is named. Lecce is a city of baroque run wild
under the influence of the Spanish court between 1660 and 1770.
The city then had as many monks as laymen: for the breadth of its
ecclesiastical scholarship, it was known as the Apulian Athens. Churches
were built with lunatic ornamentation. Their portals are adorned with
grinning caryatids and great festoons of foliage; cornices swirl round
columns, windows are laden with great swags of flowers upheld by stone
trophies or heraldic crests.
Lecce is quite an embarrassment of baroque, a great monument to the
stonemason's art. Sitwell himself adored the place. He compared it (perhaps
after a bottle of Malvasia) to a giant fruit bowl.
Yet Lecce is still fairly unknown. It must be the rare southern Italian city
never to have put Garibaldi up for the night. An 1883 Baedeker to the
Mezzogiorno has only this to say about Lecce: 'Situated in an unattractive
district, not far from the sea.'
Lecce was discovered by foreigners 20 years later when a British architect,
Martin Briggs, published a book in praise of the churches. Briggs relates in
Unknown City how the flourish of architecture in Lecce was more or less
coincident with the designs of Sir Christopher Wren in London.
The colour of the local stone from which churches were constructed is a warm
golden brown, and so malleable that you can cut it with a knife. No building
was too intricate or decorative that it could not be fashioned from pietra
di Lecce. Marble itself was hostile to such florid carving - too hard on the
chisel.
The supreme expression of Lecce baroque is the Chiesa di Santa Croce. It
took 150 years to build and the facade pullulates with detail: fantastic
monsters adorn a rose window of wedding-cake fanciness, miniature angels
flit to and fro along the conduits. The architect Antonio Zimbalo (nicknamed
Il Zingarello - Little Gypsy) was responsible.
Much of Lecce as it stands today is the product of his lunatic design.
Zimbalo's efforts were rooted firmly in renaissance classicism, but they are
more miracles of decoration than architecture.
Piazza del Duomo, a theatrical showcase, was once the administrative heart
of Lecce. It is a rare example in Italy of a completely closed square. There
is nothing quite like it, I think, in Europe. The cathedral, rebuilt in 1659
by the ubiquitous Zimbalo, is an illustration of how even the decorations in
Lecce have themselves been decorated: there are angels everywhere.
To the right of the cathedral stands the magnificent seminary. This was
designed by a student of Zimbalo's, Giuseppe Cino. Scrollworks of sandstone
are patterned like icing on a cake; a communal well in the courtyard appears
to sprout clumps of giant broccoli (actually stone pomegranates) that have
been split to reveal the seeds inside. This is barocco leccese in all its
fancy futility, insanely ornamental.
The weird and wonderful Chiesa del Rosario, Zimbalo's last work, is larded
with stone vases of fruit and flowers, giant acorns, chiselled peacocks
which peck at melon, pear and fig. Its cloisters have been commandeered by
the Italian government's Tobacco Administration.
Lecce is not all bijouterie baroque. The curious Missionary Museum of
Chinese Artifacts will delight any sinophile. Dusty rooms are cluttered with
12th-century Chinese coins, buddhist figurines, bronze statuettes of Kubla
Khan, together with tools and weapons made by the 'aboriginal peoples of
Formosa.'
For some reason the museum also contains more than 200 specimens of
crustaceans in a marine fauna section. Nearby in Piazza Sant'Oronzo,
dominated by a bronze statue of the city's patron saint, stand the remains
of a Roman amphitheatre. Sunk below ground, the archaeological site is
littered with slabs of stone that show gladiators gored by bulls, or fending
off lions with spears.
In a province of stout Norman churches and restrained Romanesque cathedrals,
Lecce will come as a glorious surprise. It is the Florence of the Italian
south.
Lunch in the Grand Hotel of Lecce (a magnificent Edwardian establishment
whose interminable corridors nevertheless bring to mind a state
penitentiary) should, of course, be accompanied by a bottle of Sitwell's
Malvasia. The wine will not explode, only effervesce.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Property: Cyprus, anxious to keep up standards - Audrey
Powell considers the penalties and rewards of buying an island holiday home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO MANY people wanted to visit Cyprus on holiday this year that the island
authorities asked tour operators to cut the number of flights. The island is
anxious to keep up the quality of its visitors and does not want them coming
on very cheap packages, or with no accommodation booked.
You might think, then, that buying a property in Cyprus and letting to
holidaymakers might be good for the owner and for the island's tourism.
However, stiff regulations relate to property-owning by aliens in Cyprus.
Officially, non-Cypriots are not allowed to let, although the authorities
admit that letting is rampant. The Cyprus Trade Centre in London says it is
becoming clear that the government will eventually attempt to control this
which might mean that income from letting would be affected.
However, one island estate agent said it was not the money involved that was
the problem. The Cyprus Tourist Office did not want people letting without a
licence as they might be offering poor accommodation.
Permission to buy in the first place must be obtained from the Council of
Ministers. This is usually granted, although with demand by non-Cypriots for
property, especially flats, increasing, it could take several months. A
non-Cypriot may only own one property or buy up to about two-thirds of an
acre on which to have one built. The Cyprus Trade Centre (071-734-4791) is a
useful source of information for potential buyers and can supply a checklist
of steps to be taken by a non-Cypriot purchasing on the island.
On resale, a non-Cypriot is allowed to repatriate the amount of the original
purchase, but taking out any profit must be staggered. This regulation may
soon disappear; as Cypriots themselves are now allowed to take out an
increasing amount of money, it is increasingly felt to be pointless.
Prices in Cyprus are reasonable and life is easy. There is a wide choice of
new property being built both by large developers and small builders. On the
other side of the coin, this results in a poor market for resales, if you
want to leave.
Many British buyers already know the island, through serving there in the
forces or in other work. Some have regularly spent holidays there and buy
for retirement, or pre-retirement. That market accounts for a considerable
proportion of sales to purchasers, with the island's low tax rates an
important draw. The island is of less long-term interest to younger people
as non-Cypriots are not allowed to work there.
A disadvantage for some who might like to consider a holiday home in Cyprus
is the lack of golf courses. There is a reluctance to use precious water to
irrigate. In some areas the general water supply has to be rationed in dry
summers.
Even so, you are regularly assured that the first full-size civilian course
is going to materialise 'next year'. Now it is 'autumn 1993' and only the
greens will probably be green. There is said to be a waiting list.
A shadow still hangs over Cyprus: it has been a divided island since the
Turkish invasion in 1974, although the situation has been stable for many
years. It is hoped that discussions between the Greek and Turkish sides that
have been taking place in New York under the sponsorship of the United
Nations, will finally bring about a solution. These are due to resume on
October 26. The aim would be to make a federal republic of Cyprus, after
approval of an overall framework agreement by the two communities in
separate referendums.
This would clearly facilitate its application to join the EC, leading to
more regulations, like that prohibiting non-Cypriots from working on the
island, being relaxed.
But there are many who do not see the long-running Cyprus question being
resolved shortly. Some even suggest that the Greek Cypriot section, the
southern two thirds of the island, might aim to join the EC on its own.
Either way, Cyprus is a pleasant island, which gets a lot of sun. The people
are friendly, most speak English and as a former colony, they understand
British customs.
So, a brief look at a few properties that a buyer might consider.
Leptos, in the development field for 30 years, says its flagship is still
Kamares Village, set back in the hills five miles from Paphos and
overlooking Coral Bay. It is part way through its 600-villa programme there.
Properties are built to order, taking about 18 months. A two-bedroom
bungalow could cost Pounds 79,000, but prices depend on design and plot. It
has a number of other projects under construction, some are small schemes,
some offer apartments and maisonettes.
An increasing number of older citizens attracted by Cyprus's advantages are
retiring to the island, says London manager Peter Katsantonis. Special
reciprocal treaties between Cyprus and the UK enable pensions to be remitted
tax free. Local income tax is levied at the rate of 3 per cent of one's
declared income.
Leptos' London office (081-340-8096) can send a free booklet 'A Guide to
Retirement in Paphos'.
There is Cybarco (London tel 071-436-3881), a civil engineering and
construction company and member of the Lanitis Group.
Among its latest developments are Marina Beach, in Limassol, close to the
sea and the Sheraton hotel and marina, offering two-bedroom apartments from
Pounds 40,800, and Yialos Village, Larnaca, a beachside development of
apartments and bungalows from Pounds 27,000.
For a different market it offers Plati Yitonia, in Nicosia, two-storey, four
bedroom houses near the national park. These have verandahs, gardens and
parking spaces, and are priced from Pounds 99,400.
Cosmo Developers (London tel 071-243-2113), established in 1945, says it
employs 25,000 people worldwide. Its leisure division includes residential
property, hotels and Cyprus's first country club.
It has six projects on the island, in demand both from the British retired
but also from families of expats working in the Middle East.
But not everyone wants new property. Somerset-based Babet (0460-76213)
points to the variety of scenery in Cyprus, with its wooded Troodos
mountains rising 6,400 ft above sea level and its cultivated land growing
vines, lemons, olives.
If that is of more appeal, this agency has resales away from the towns and
resorts. There is also the 11th century village of Vouni, in the Troodos
foothills: 'The surrounding mountains are terraced vineyards and Vouni's
grapes produce one of the best local wines.'
Many of the houses have internal stone arches spanning the width of the
property, exposed rafters and timber balconies overlooking the narrow
streets. The agency has several of these for sale, some unconverted from
Pounds 10,800; others already renovated, from Pounds 50,400.

FT  03 OCT 92 / The convicts who reap what they have sown - Nicholas Lander
visits one of Britain's largest agricultural operations and finds that the
prison farm officers face a life of hard labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY years after starting as a farm foreman, Maurice Codd runs the third
biggest farming operation in the country.
But his is not a rags to riches story, as the nature of his workforce
reveals. Codd started at Pounds 11 per week on a farm attached to Dartmoor
Prison in Devon. Now, as Chief Farms and Gardens Manager for HM Prison
Service, a Grade 6 Civil Service post which carries a salary of Pounds
26,000-Pounds 34,000 per annum, he manages 5,500 hectares of marginal
farming land and a workforce of 3,500 prison inmates from an office in
Croydon.
Putting prisoners to work on farms is not unique to the British penal
system; when I met Codd he was flying off to meet his counterpart in the US.
The constraints under which Codd and his 80 strong management work and the
diverse goals they have to achieve are quite different from those of normal
farm managers. They must make the prison system as self-sufficient as
possible in foodstuffs (by producing enough to feed 47,000 inmates three
times a day) and train inmates for a career upon their eventual release.
Farming was first introduced to the British penal system at Dartmoor because
it provided a healthy and hard day's work in the open air. It was an
integral part of the Borstal regime when it was first established near
Rochester in 1908. Prison farms have grown sharply as the number of
prisoners has grown and as prisoners have increasingly been seen as an
effective, and cheap, way of converting marginal land that no commercial
farmer could be persuaded to touch.
Codd's organisation includes 17 large farms around Britain with 2,400 dairy
cows, 1,400 breeding sows, 2,000 ewes and 4,000 laying hens. It produces
12,000 tonnes of potatoes, 6,000 tonnes of cabbage and 3,000 tonnes of
carrots a year. The farms also provide most of the milk for the prisons and
sell 6.5m litres to the Milk Marketing Board. There are five distribution
centres around the country and prisons receive their deliveries three times
a week via private contractors.
Until 1968 when a Cabinet directive stipulated that prison farms must become
cost effective, they were run, says Codd, on the 'dog and stick' principle
and lost Pounds 200,000 a year. Things have changed. Today the only time a
smile leaves Codd's countenance is when he talks about the Treasury.
Codd's annual turnover is over Pounds 35m and he receives an annual grant of
Pounds 8m from the Treasury towards the running of the farms. But because he
is Treasury-funded he cannot plough back any profits, nor is he eligible for
any external grants. His management is pushed to make a profit but not
allowed to retain what it makes and this, for Codd, removes the biggest
source of staff motivation.
The prison farm system has little commercial contact with the outside world.
It cannot sell to others as this would naturally upset commercial farmers.
Prison farm workers are paid just Pounds 3 to Pounds 5 a week, not in cash
but credits. But the saving that this cheap labour generates is not credited
back to the farms either. Under the present set-up, which may change when
the prison service becomes an Agency Service in April 1993, it does seem
that the Treasury is the beneficiary of a system of funding distinctly at
odds with anything approaching the stimulus of the free market.
Codd and his managers face two other constraints on their performance. New
prison buildings will have to be built on land taken from the surrounding
farmland. Codd will therefore have to feed more inmates on less land. In the
meantime, because of prison over-crowding, only the more serious offenders
are being sent to jail. As his farm workers are prisoners with good
behaviour records or nearing the end of their sentences, Codd is also having
to cope with a shortage of suitable labour.
A day spent with Ivor Gough, farm manager at HM Standford Hill, an open
prison on the Isle of Sheppey on the north Kent coast, showed the many
non-financial rewards of farming with inmates.
Gough trained at Agricultural College in his native Shropshire before
running a Salvation Army farm for the poor in Jamaica. He combines
professionalism with a common touch and a sense of humour.
He needs all these attributes. Grade 3 is considered the poorest quality
land for farming purposes but Gough's land was Grade 3 minus. It was an
airfield in the Second World War - RAF Eastchurch. It was heavily bombed and
the craters were filled with rubble. The hangars were heavily strafed,
leaving scars which are visible today. The base was decommissioned in 1951
and handed over to the prison farming service.
It is an incongruous sight. Because the prison farming system receives such
limited capital it has to make do and mend. Gough's offices, from which
produce is despatched daily to London's 27 prisons, are the semi-circular
homes built for RAF officers in 1938. Huge buildings that used to be hangars
for aircraft assembly lines now act as cold storages for up to 800 tonnes of
potatoes and processing and packaging units for root crops.
His 150 head of cattle are still milked on a system that, says Gough, would
long ago have been replaced on any commercial farm. After the 1989 riots at
Strangeways Prison in Manchester, all capital expenditure on farms was
frozen. As Gough explained resignedly: 'New accommodation for the inmates
was more important than new homes for the pigs.'
I was fortunate enough to visit on a hot summer's day when most inmates were
happy to have the opportunity to be working outside. The men, mostly young,
worked in prison uniforms - blue shirts and jeans or overalls - but the
absence today of the traditionally brutal prison hair cut made it difficult
to spot exactly who was a prisoner.
Those I saw on the prison farm had all earned the right to be there. All
were in low-risk categories and had served part of their sentence and now,
the authorities felt, would respond to the more relaxed atmosphere of an
open prison. There are few attempts at escape. The punishment, the immediate
removal of the good conduct award, which carried with it the remission of a
third of a prisoner's sentence, is sufficient deterrent.
Gough is visited frequently by environmental health officers and must obey
all the legislation laid down by the Health and Safety Executive. His
produce must be as good as the food the kitchen catering officers, whose
budget for feeding a grown man varies from 88p to 120p per day, can buy from
outside suppliers.
Dennis Neville, production and marketing manager for the prison farm system,
said his 47,000 customers are obviously dissatisfied and that the food is
always the first thing they will complain about.
When I asked what was the biggest difference between a commercial farm and
one within the prison system he immediately replied: 'the workforce.'
He did not mean this uncharitably. Because the farms provide work, therapy
and training for the outside world Gough has a constant workforce of 110
when his commercial competitors are seeking to shed labour at every
opportunity.
Gough cannot hire or fire. He has to find work for all his prisoners whether
they want to work or not and their working days are frequently interrupted
by visitors - either family, police or probation officers.
One way in which the prison farm system has been able to make a virtue of
its workforce, its size and its need to provide a vocational training has
been through its connection with the Rare Breed Association which began six
years ago.
To help the national gene bank to maintain as many bloodlines as possible 15
prison farms stock increasing numbers of what were rare animals.
Ove 40 species rare animals are bred on prison farms. Among them are British
Lop pigs, belted Galloway cattle and Indian runner ducks. The prison system
also boasts 27 Suffolk punch-horses, the farm work horse. It is the largest
herd in the world.
I was introduced to Squire, a Suffolk punch which weighs just over a ton. He
was being groomed for the weekend when, drawing a repainted gun carriage, he
would take children for rides at a village fair.
Of his two grooms, one with long curly hair and a confident air had appeared
last year on the front page of the Financial Times in a fraud case. His
colleague, with tattoos, grey cropped hair and a beard that gave him the air
of a genial pirate, had been sentenced for smuggling cannabis in a case The
Sun newspaper had headlined as 'Bangers and Hash'.
The prison farm system was teaching these, and many other city-bred
prisoners, vocational skills and providing the basics for a new career.
Appearing at agricultural shows and fairs, such as the recent Royal
Agricultural Show at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, where they won 25 awards, is
also teaching the prisoners social skills and introducing them gradually
back into society.
Pride of place in Gough's crowded office was a book of drawings and
thank-you letters from a local group of Brownies who had recently spent a
day down on his farm.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Working to solve an attitude
problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANDY BERRY recalls how he went to Jaguar with another disabled colleague.
'One bloke took a look at us and he was thinking: 'Do I ask them to leave
now, or listen and then get rid of them as soon as possible?' But we could
have solved one of his business problems concerning the software for an
industrial control system.'
Berry has cerebral palsy, a disability in which the brain has difficulty
controlling the body's muscles. He has a first class mathematics degree from
the then Middlesex Polytechnic and an MSc in computer science taken at the
University of Manchester. He now works as a one-man information technology
business from the study of his Milton Keynes home.
Running a small company is tough enough. When you have a disability it does
not make it easier. 'People seem to need persuading I'm serious. Most people
sub-consciously feel that I'd somehow be OK if I didn't work. But that is
not true. I do not receive any money from the state, not even a mobility
allowance. Some of the things people say to me still wind me up.'
Berry, who is also a vice chairman of the Spastics Society is a humorous
man. Pressing a button on the keyboard of his computer a list of 'goals'
appears and one of them is 'Have fun]' He laughs. 'I refuse to work on
anything I'm not interested in doing.' One of his bookcases is crammed with
Isaac Asimov and Len Deighton books. But he is also very serious about what
he does. The other bookcase is loaded with tomes and booklets with titles
like New Math CoProcessors, The C Language and Public Domain Powerhouses as
well as four books on computer technology he co-authored with two other
disabled writers.
Most of Berry's work is difficult to grasp for a computer illiterate. One of
his contracts is with a US company, EMC. This company is producing a system
which will allow you at home to obtain a film on video without walking to a
video shop. Instead it will be piped to your television via a satellite
link. Another of Berry's contracts is with a Danish enterprise working on
methods of transferring television Teletext on to paper.
'What I'm best at is identifying novel solutions and finding people to put
them into practice working with me. I tend not to get involved with heavy
programing, you know, bashing out reams of codes. A typical programer only
writes 20 programs in his life. I've done 30 and that's enough.'
Berry's sharp mind contrasts with his slow and distorted speech. He set up
his business late last year after working for several large and a few small
companies, in some of which he was part owner. He charges Pounds 350 a day
for his services and hopes to turn over about Pounds 40,000 in his first
full year. Some of his contracts are about to run out and he concedes that
he does not have enough on his plate to ensure financial comfort. 'I can
just earn enough to survive.'
Disability adds to the day-to-day costs of the 41-year-old who lives alone
though he will soon share a house with his girl friend, a solicitor who also
has cerebral palsy. Berry spends close to Pounds 2,000 a year on taxis and a
pair of shoes lasts only a month. A small, home-based business racks up
large costs. Berry's yearly telephone bill is around Pounds 4,000. He spends
Pounds 4,000 on software. Publicity accounts for a further Pounds 3,000. The
personal computer with printer and fax were a one-off buy at about Pounds
5,000.
Berry meets a lot of people and tries never to miss a chance to obtain work.
Extra-curricular posts include membership of the Central Transport
Consultative Committee. 'It can take four or five years from meeting someone
to getting business. If I'm in a 'disabled mood' I think it takes that time
because I am disabled.' Which brings us back to how people deal with
disability.
'A major problem is not with me but with other people's attitudes. Some do
not want anything to do with disability. They have some sort of problem
dealing with it. Then you get the person who laughs. This is often the
receptionist. It is staggering the number of places I ring up and even if I
ask to speak to a named individual they nevertheless ask if I want the
personnel department because they think I'm looking for a job. It's this
whole problem of not treating disabled people seriously. I still haven't
learnt to deal with it.'
Berry still has the sense of humour to clear up any misunderstanding on how
you should write about disability. 'I have cerebral palsy. If you say I
suffer from cerebral palsy I'll kill you.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why it pays to keep good company -
Planning Your Pension / Debbie Harrison examines the different types of
occupational schemes and their advantages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has the most developed private sector system of pensions in the EC,
covering about 50 per cent of employees. Most of these - more than 11m
people - are in occupational schemes approved by the Inland Revenue, and
total funds backing them are estimated at Pounds 300bn. But what advantages
do they confer in return for this massive investment?
Company schemes are extremely tax-efficient. Contributions are paid free of
basic and higher rate tax, the pension fund builds up tax-free, and a
significant chunk of pension can be taken as tax-free cash at retirement.
The pension itself is taxed as income.
There are two main types of occupational scheme: final salary and money
purchase. Final salary schemes still dominate both the public and private
sectors.
Final salary schemes
Under these - also known as 'defined benefit' schemes - the pension is
linked to the value of the employee's final salary at retirement. Most
schemes are contracted-out of the state earnings-related pension scheme
(Serps) and pay a reduced rate of employee and employer National Insurance
contributions.
In return, they guarantee to provide a pension at least as good as the Serps
benefit given up. This is known as the guaranteed minimum pension (GMP),
which must increase annually in line with the retail prices index (RPI).
(Contracted-in schemes simply pay a pension in addition to Serps).
In a typical scheme, the pension builds up at a rate of 1/60th of final
salary for each year of service up to a maximum of 40/60ths, or two-thirds.
Where tax-free cash is taken, the value of the pension is reduced.
Less-generous schemes operate on an '80ths' basis where the employee builds
up 1/80th of final salary for every year of service and after 40 years has
achieved a pension worth only 40/80ths, or one half, of final salary. But
public sector schemes that operate in this way are treated as equivalent in
value to a 60ths scheme because the tax-free cash is paid in addition to the
pension.
About 50 per cent of company schemes reduce the pension by integrating with
the state scheme. Typically, where a scheme is integrated, the first slice
of salary up to the NI lower earnings limit of Pounds 2,800 is classed as
non-pensionable.
A minority of schemes for senior management is very generous and builds up
at the rate of 1/30th of final salary for each year of service, allowing the
employee to achieve a maximum two-thirds pension after just 20 years.
In the past, the pension age in most company schemes was 65 for men and 60
for women but, following a change in EC law, many are moving towards an
equal pension age of 65. Where an employee takes voluntary early retirement,
the pension almost always is reduced.
Most final salary schemes provide other important family protection benefits
in addition to the pension itself: for example, death benefits of between
two and four times annual salary, or widow's and dependent children's
pensions. Long-term disability pensions and private medical insurance also
are common.
By law, every scheme must have an additional voluntary contributions (AVCs)
provision although, since 1987, employees also have been able to contribute
to individual plans known as free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs) and provided mainly
by insurance companies.
Employees can contribute up to 15 per cent of gross pay to an occupational
scheme. Pay in this context is defined as basic salary plus benefits such as
overtime, bonuses, and the taxable value of fringe benefits. But some
schemes limit pensionable pay to basic salary. Earnings excluded from
pensionable pay under the main company scheme can be used for AVCs.
In practice, most employees pay about 5 per cent of salary into the scheme
while employers vary their contributions according to what is needed to meet
the pensions guaranteed by it. As a result, employers tend to pay more on
behalf of older employees approaching retirement than for younger employees
who have 30-40 years to go. Where employers do pay a fixed rate, this is
usually twice that of the employees.
Over the past five years, the Revenue has restricted the pensions of certain
high earners. In particular, some employees are, in the present tax year,
subject to a cap of Pounds 75,000 on which contributions and the final
pension can be based.
This cap applies to members of final salary schemes set up after the 1989
Budget and members who joined any final salary scheme after June 1, 1989.
For them, the maximum contributions for this tax year are limited to Pounds
11,250 (15 per cent of Pounds 75,000), while the maximum pension is
two-thirds of the cap, or Pounds 50,000.
Companies can provide pensions for salaries above the cap by using
'unapproved' schemes which, although recognised by the Revenue, do not have
the same tax advantages as those that are approved.
If you change jobs after two years in a scheme, you cannot claim a rebate of
contributions and must leave your pension where it is - known as a preserved
pension - or transfer it elsewhere. By law, the value of a preserved pension
must increase by the level of the RPI up to a cap of 5 per cent. This is
known as limited price indexation, or LPI.
The other options are to transfer your benefits to the new employer's scheme
or to an insurance product - either a personal pension or a buy-out bond.
But transfer options should be considered only with the help of a pensions
professional.
Most companies provide annual increases of 3-5 per cent on pensions in
payment. Some increases are guaranteed, but others are discretionary
reviews.
When an outstanding requirement of the Social Security Act 1990 is
introduced, all schemes must increase pensions by at least LPI although,
where the scheme is not in surplus, LPI will apply only to benefits built up
from the date of implementation. Public sector pensions increase
automatically in line with the full RPI, as do public sector preserved
pensions.
Money purchase
Under a money purchase scheme, contributions are invested to provide a fund
at retirement which is used to buy an annuity. The value of the fund - and,
hence, the annuity - is not guaranteed but depends on the provider's
investment performance and charges. There are two types of money purchase
arrangement: contracted-out money purchase schemes (Comps) and group
personal pensions (GPPs).
Under a Comp, the Serps rebate must be included in the 15 per cent
contribution limit. Since Comps are classed as occupational schemes by the
Revenue, the annuity income must not exceed two-thirds final salary. Some
Comps provide a guaranteed minimum pension but others offer only 'protected
rights' where the the rules guarantee that a minimum contribution, equal to
the Serps rebate, is paid into the fund. Unfortunately, there is no
guarantee of what this will be worth at retirement.
Most Comps also provide death in service benefits. Just to complicate
matters further, there is also a Comp where the annuity purchased by the
pension is paid in addition to Serps.
In 1988, companies lost the right to make membership of their schemes a
condition of employment. This coincided with the introduction of personal
pensions which allowed employees to opt out of Serps individually for the
first time.
Group personal pensions are not classed as occupational schemes by the
Revenue. In practice, they operate in the same way as individual plans
although, sometimes, the employees benefit from the economies of scale.
All GPPs used to contract-out of Serps offer protected rights. Personal
pension contribution limits start at 17.5 per cent of net relevant earnings
(equivalent in this context to pensionable pay) for employees up to age 35,
and rising to 40 per cent for employees age 61 and over. Employer
contributions must be included in these limits.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gibs look rocky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATES on offer for guaranteed income bonds (Gibs) show just how confused
people have been, writes John Authers.
On September 16 - Black Wednesday - one company, American Life, even assumed
that base rates were going to stay at 12 per cent and raised rates. This led
to the strange pattern shown in the accompanying graph for September,
compiled by Baronworth Investment Services.
The actuaries who control the rates on offer from Gibs took a while to get
over their confusion. The graph shows only the best rates on offer. Some
firms offered much less. At the beginning of this week it was possible to
get 7 per cent, guaranteed over one year, but the worst rate was only 5.1.
Over five years, the gap is from 8 to 6.8 per cent. On Black Wednesday,
one-year rates varied from 9.3 to 6.15 per cent.
So, perhaps the most important lesson from the past fortnight is that if you
want to buy a Gib, you should do so only through an independent adviser who
can pick the best rate.
The reliance of Gibs on short-dated bond yields is such, however, that an
adviser should probably not sell you one at all. Most are based on low-risk
corporate bonds or fixed term building society bonds, with sizeable holdings
in short-dated gilts.
They are encouragingly simple products which guarantee you either an annual
income, with capital returned at the end of the period, or a guaranteed
annual level of growth. Basic-rate tax is paid by the fund; you will be
liable to pay more if you are a top-rate taxpayer.
This level of security is very attractive. But the rates on offer,
particularly with many marketeers predicting that inflation will return, are
not good enough. The best rates over one year are 6 per cent for Pounds
1,000 and 7 per cent for Pounds 50,000. Over five years, these rise to 7.5
and 8 per cent.
National Savings' index-linked certificates still guarantee to beat
inflation by 4.5 per cent over five years. That means they will beat Gibs if
inflation over the next five years averages more than 3.5 per cent. And long
bond yields show that marketeers expect inflation to be worse than this.
James Higgins, of Chamberlain De Broe, says: 'Before anyone buys the
five-year Gibs, they should make sure that they hold the full allowance of
5th issue index-linked certificates.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bonds turmoil batters the fixed-rate
savings market - John Authers assesses the impact for private investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BONDS TURNED upside-down last month. Events in this complicated market often
seem obscure compared with the impact of currencies and equities. But
Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism will have profound
and long-lasting effects on the fixed rates which investors can receive.
Two products - annuities and guaranteed income bonds - are almost wholly
reliant on the gilts market. After the last two weeks, the rates you can get
from both these products could be radically different. In future, it might
be better to look for security from a new range of products which rely on
complex derivatives, like futures and options.
So what has happened to gilts? As the graph shows, there is a steady
long-term relationship between the yields on long-dated and short-dated
gilts, and the bank base rate. Short-dated gilts (with five years or less
until they mature) have been priced so that they offer a higher yield than
long-dated gilts (with 15 years or more before the government buys them
back).
Yields on both have fallen generally in line with base rates. But once
sterling was devalued, 'long' yields overtook those of shorts, for the first
time in years.
This was because of inflation expectations. Marketeers thought inflation
would increase and erode the value of long-dated bonds by the time they
matured. So they cut the price accordingly. That meant the yield, or income,
available from them increased as a proportion of their price.
Meanwhile, the prices of short-dated gilts rose, because base rates had been
reduced. Cash deposit alternatives were less attractive, so dealers were
prepared to pay more for short-dated gilts. Inflation is less important when
pricing these gilts because there is so little time before they mature.
Days earlier, the market had anticipated low inflation and high base rates.
Suddenly, dealers acted on the assumption of the opposite - and the impact
was soon to be felt on products available to savers.
ANNUITIES
Annuities guarantee to pay you a fixed annual sum until you die. You
normally buy them with the proceeds of a pension fund, but they can also
make sense for people a few years into their retirement who have more
savings which they want to convert into income - the tax position will be
better than if they are bought as part of a pension. As a rule it is best to
wait before taking an annuity because rates improve as you get older.
The graph below, prepared by Sage Financial Consultants, shows annuities
come down in response to gilt yields, but not necessarily in response to
base rate cuts. So pensioners might actually do well out of the turmoil in
gilts.
Brokers report that annuity rates have not increased in the last two weeks,
but neither have they declined. If long-dated yields stay at their current
levels, as many analysts are predicting, then annuity rates should increase.
People disagree about this. William Burrows, of Sage, says: 'Annuity rates
are going down. There's a lot of uncertainty, but the pressure is without
doubt downwards.'
Clive Scott-Hopkins, of Towry Law, thinks it best for investors to lock into
annuities now. With base rates falling and annuities steady, he can see a
window of opportunity.
But a Norex Pensions adviser says: 'Anyone who agrees that inflation is
likely to increase over the coming year need not rush to buy an annuity  -
unless they want an RPI linked annuity.'
The income from index-linked annuities increases with inflation. Their
initial income is lower and they invest mostly in index-linked gilts. Prices
for these have risen because of worries about inflation, so index-linked
annuities could soon be dearer. It pays to shop around. Sage says the
difference between the best and worst rates on offer can be as much as 15
per cent.
GUARANTEED CAPITAL BONDS
Where are guaranteed returns to be found now? The answer could be from a new
product which has been made possible by advances in the derivatives market.
Derivatives - futures and options - have a reputation for being risky, and
if you deal in them on your own, they probably are. But they exist as a risk
limitation instrument for large investors and dealers. For example, index
futures allow you to protect against the risk of the FT index failing to
reach a particular level.
Advances in the sophistication of the market, coupled with horror on the
part of investors as they watched the market turmoil last month, have led to
a flood of new products for private investors.
The basic concept is to allow you to freeze an advance in a market index
over a certain period. Once this rise has been awarded, it cannot be taken
away. Meanwhile, the funds guarantee that they will not go down in value.
This allows you equity 'upside', without risking losing money.
This sounds like a modernised version of 'with-profits' investments, which
also aim to offer a guarantee against falls in value, combined with steady
growth which once awarded cannot be taken away. But with-profits bonds have
bonuses and surrender values set at the discretion of actuaries, and can
fall in value. The charm of guaranteed capital bonds is that you can find
out the current value of the investment just by looking up the index.
Current offers come from Laurentian Life, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Dunbar Bank,
Citibank Life and Scottish Provident. It is important to take financial
advice on these products before investing as their flexibility varies - some
lock you in for five years while others allow earlier withdrawals - and some
are liable to basic rate tax.
What of the future? According to Robert Benson, of Midland Montagu, who has
helped design several of the products, the next development will be to
introduce guaranteed pension funds of this kind and to allow regular premium
savings.
After that, he suggests that it could be possible to offer index-linking,
links to more than one index, or currency protection.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Markets: The best policy? Never surrender - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE field of personal finance, 'never surrender' is not a bad motto,
although it might often be impractical. It is most relevant, though, if you
are holding on to a long-term with-profits life policy. The companies
offering them have set them up on the assumption that they will last a fixed
long term.
If you surrender early, you have broken the original contract and put their
calculations awry. Life companies use this as a justification for offering
you worse value than you would receive if you waited until maturity. So, the
rule until now has always been - don't surrender.
Sadly, as the Weekend FT has reported extensively, many savers have been
forced to surrender their policies over the past few years. In 1991 -
according to a now-notorious survey by the Securities and Investments Board,
produced at the end of last year - 37 per cent of unit-linked life policies
and 23 per cent of with-profits policies were terminated within a year of
being started.
This was amplified last week by another survey, for Money Management. This
showed that across a range of the 11 companies which were prepared to admit
their figures, 16 per cent of 25-year with-profits policies started in 1990
had been surrendered already.
These figures do, however, tell as much about the state of the housing
market and the economy as they do about the unsuitability of life policies.
Rising unemployment, falling house prices and rising home repossessions have
forced many young families to surrender their policies in an attempt to get
some cash. A survey, by the Watford Group of large life insurers, found
divorce was another big factor.
In a last resort like this, it might be necessary to release the cash from
an endowment. But that does not mean that you should surrender a policy.
Surrender values are bad. Earlier this year, Money Marketing examined
surrender values on offer for 25-year policies after 24 years. While some
offices were offering as much as 90 per cent of the final maturity value,
several offered much worse rates. Commercial Union, the present top payer
when policies reach maturity, paid out only 61 per cent after 24 years.
The value you receive in these circumstances is worked out as a totally
separate calculation from the accrual of bonuses. Thus, surrender is not a
way to 'lock in' to present high bonuses as some people seem, unfortunately,
to have assumed. But penal surrender values do make it possible for
marketmakers to buy a policy and sell it to someone else to make a profit.
Therefore, even if you are desperate for cash, you should not surrender an
endowment until you have been given a quote for it from a marketmaker. How
much you can gain this way varies, depending on the life office and the
length of the policy.
One marketmaker, Policy Portfolio, cites an Equity &amp; Law policy started in
September 1980 with premiums of Pounds 18.79; this would have a surrender
value of Pounds 3,346 now but Policy Portfolio would pay Pounds 3,900 for
it. A Scottish Amicable 20-year policy taken out in November 1980 with
Pounds 31 premiums would have a surrender value of Pounds 6,913, and a
market price of Pounds 8,000.
Marketmakers agree that you can gain an average of between 10 and 20 per
cent by selling your policy rather than accepting limply what the life
office offers you. A few laudable life offices pay a surrender value which
the market cannot better - but they are in the minority.
Bonus rates on maturity are now under severe pressure and final pay-outs
from these policies are likely to come down. Does this mean that those who
are not cash-starved should still get rid of their endowment, as an
investment decision? Definitely not: that is shown by the fact that demand
exists to buy policies at a higher price than you can sell them for.
As Sammy Alexander, of Policy Portfolio, puts it: 'If it is worthwhile for
the endowment holder to sell, that means it is not worthwhile for the
investor to purchase the policy. We exist only because there is demand from
purchasers.'
David Beale, of Beale Dobie, echoes this point: 'We buy these policies
because we think they are good investments at the price at which we are
buying.' In effect, his advice to someone who was selling, and did not need
to, would be: 'Don't'
The strength of demand for unmatured endowments is undeniable. Earlier this
year, Kleinwort Benson even launched an entire investment trust investing
only in such policies. Unlike virtually any other launch of shares this
year, it was oversubscribed. Plainly, many people in the market still think
this is a good investment, even though bonus rates at present are
unrealistic, and are likely to come down.
Regular readers of the Weekend FT will know that I am not a fan of
with-profits endowment policies; there seem to be better investments on
offer for those taking out a mortgage. But if you have already started
paying the premiums, and can afford to carry on, then do. And never
surrender]

FT  03 OCT 92 / Markets: The excitement of being safe and boring - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in the water and electricity companies might be forgiven for
being startled - and for wondering what to do now.
Their apparently 'safe and boring' investments have outperformed the stock
market steadily since the general election in April - water by 50 per cent
by the end of August and electricity by 25 per cent. But after sterling's
exit from the ERM they have abruptly lost half that relative gain.
This week's call for lower water charges from Ofwat, the water industry
regulator, also reminded the market that utilities remain highly regulated.
The case for holding the stocks - which used to be relatively
straightforward - has become more complex.
Many small shareholders of utilities picked up the stock in the
privatisations, water in 1989 and electricity in 1990. The conventional
wisdom for holding them is that they are 'safe' investments, quasi-bonds.
They pay a relatively high yield to compensate for relatively modest growth
prospects. But with little competition entering their markets, they generate
profits and dividends which are less sensitive to the economic cycle than
many industries. These qualities have come to the fore in the recession.
However that picture is complicated by several factors. Political risk
disappeared with the general election result. But both water and the
regional electricity companies remain highly regulated by watchdogs which
have proved they are not shy of intervening. Last week Ofwat told the water
companies that they must hold back the increase in next year's prices by two
percentage points, and a wider review of industry pricing is due in 1994.
Water and electricity also face the threat of new environmental legislation,
both from Britain and the EC. The electricity industry has spent nearly
Pounds 1bn on limiting sulphur emissions, and water companies are in the
middle of an investment programme of up to Pounds 42bn to meet EC
directives. But many stockbrokers are arguing that the attractions of the
stocks still outweigh the disadvantages, particularly if the market's first
hopes that the ERM exit meant a fast economic recovery prove too optimistic.
The lack of overseas profits for both water and electricity means they are
less affected than many by the depreciation of sterling. As their annual
price rises are linked to inflation under the regulatory formula, they may
be able to protect margins better than other companies, provided they
control costs.
However, their greatest attraction remains the dividend growth as dividends
for many companies on the stock market are likely to grow more slowly than
they did in the 1980s. Analysts expect the water companies to pay out
increases above the rate of inflation of 4 to 5 per cent a year until the
1995 industry review, and 2 to 3 per cent afterwards. For the electricity
companies, expectations are 6 to 8 per cent real growth until 1995, and 4 to
5 per cent thereafter.
Brokers are at present divided in recommending whether to sell and take the
profits that still remain, or to buy more, taking advantage of the recent
weakness.
According to Peter Hyde, analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson
Securities, last week's intervention by Ofwat 'was a reminder that
regulation is tightening' but he feels that many investors are still likely
to be tempted by the security and defensive qualities of the water stocks.
In the present day-by-day economic turbulence there is a good case for
holding on, at least until the macroeconomic picture becomes clearer and the
rival attractions of faster-growing companies can be assessed.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Markets: A fine line between hope and fear - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE DAYS, you have to fight your way to a fax machine at the FT. Other
newspapers get their stories by lying amid the bougainvillea above Fergie's
holiday hideaway, or bugging Antonia de Sancha's boudoir. Here we wait for
people to fax us their recriminations. So the machines are constantly
surrounded by a crowd of elbowing journalists, each trying to grab the next
scoop as it drops, curled and semi-legible, on to the floor.
Last in the queue, the London Markets column could only lay its hands on
other people's rejects: a motley collection of wheezes for getting Britain
back into the ERM, resignation letters from ministers, hastily crossed-out
drafts of Tory conference speeches - all with zero intellectual content.
Only one missive, apparently from Germany, appeared worth reprinting:
. . . fullest possible support. So there.
And another thing. It's all very well Mr Lamont and his colleagues talking
as if the UK can now have a made-in-Britain economic policy. But only
countries that dominate their economic zone, trade very little, or have a
record of long-term monetary stability can truly achieve policy
independence. The UK fulfils none of these conditions. Which means that like
it or not, the UK will have to pay attention to economic conditions abroad,
as manifested through the exchange rate.
The working papers that the British treasury is even now preparing, with
titles such as 'Monetary Policy in a Floating World', are thus, I regret to
say, worthless. What will happen, I confidently predict, is that the
government will watch the pound sliding, initially with nonchalance, then
with concern and finally with panic. It will find itself forced to take
steps to stop the pound falling further, if only by giving up the interest
rate cuts it had previously hoped for.
The UK will thus have exchanged a 'hard' exchange rate target for a 'soft'
one; large-scale intervention will be unnecessary but in other respects the
disciplines will be the same. The chancellor, whoever he may be, will find
himself tied just as closely as before to the economic policy of his
principal trading partners. The only difference is that he will find himself
doing so at a rate of DM 2.40 to the pound (or lower]) instead of DM 2.95.
Turning now to the comments on the matter in the popular British press, I
note with satisfaction the leading article in the Sun dated Friday October
2, giving full support to the policy of the Bundesbank. 'Mr Major dare not
get tough with the Germans,' the Sun wrote, 'because he knows they are
right.' Stimmt.
The stock market may not have the same access to disgruntled policymakers as
the FT, but it keeps abreast of the Sun. As this line of thinking sank in
during the week, the market sagged. The FT-SE 100 index closed at 2549.7,
down 51.3 on the week. It is now 11 per cent above its pre-devaluation
intra-day low of 2,291.3; perhaps more significantly, it is roughly half-way
between this year's high of over 2,700 in May and the 2,300 or so at which
the index was trading in early September before the currency crisis.
That mid-point reflects a neat balance of hopes and fears: hopes that the
devaluation has freed the corporate sector from the slide into depression
that continued membership of the ERM seemed to imply; fears that even so,
the domestic and international economic climate is so unfavourable that the
recovery implicit in the May level of the index is still far off.
One side-effect of the government's failed attempt to prop up the pound
could help move the market out of that range, argues Paul Walton, strategist
at James Capel. The government's heavy international borrowing, part of its
sterling support operations, has raised much of the money it would otherwise
have had to get from the gilt market. Institutional investors, who had
previously earmarked a big chunk of their next six months' Pounds 16bn or so
of cash flow for gilts, will find themselves free to put most of it into
equities.
With stronger economic growth next year, a slightly higher yield ratio, and
a greater likelihood that wavering finance directors will now hold their
dividends, that means that the market could move to a prospective dividend
yield of just over 4 per cent from its current level of 5 per cent - which
implies a 30 per cent rise in share prices.
Before you rejoice, consider the other case: sterling continues to weaken,
the government is forced to keep interest rates relatively high, consumer
confidence is unsettled by the currency crisis, companies keep on sacking
workers, profits stay weak, the world economic outlook darkens. Even if
investors give only a minority weighting to this possibility, it will help
keep their headier expectations under control.
A similar air of reined-in expectations was evident in the market's reaction
to Hongkong Land's purchase of 15 per cent of Trafalgar House in a dawn raid
on Thursday. At first, the shares jumped 29p to close at 89 1/2 p. By
Friday, though, investors had had a chance to digest the fact that Hongkong
Land's announced intention to go to just under 30 per cent and stick there
would prevent it, under Takeover Panel rules, from launching a full bid for
a year. The shares fell back, closing on Friday at 85 1/2 p - 51 per cent
higher than they were a week ago, but still well below the 160p of May.
As the chart shows, the performance of Trafalgar shares stands in marked
contrast with that of P&amp;O shares. Hongkong Land clearly feels there is scope
for recouping some of the Pounds 2bn value the stock market attributed to
the company as recently as 1989; it may find itself needing Oriental
supplies of patience to achieve them.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Markets: Searching for a ray of bad news - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SOMETHING in it for everyone,' was how the pundits described yesterday's
September employment report. By that they meant there was something in the
figures - a decline in the national unemployment rate from 7.6 per cent to
7.5 per cent and a drop of 57,000 in non-farm payrolls - for both the
Democrats and the Republicans to exploit politically.
President George Bush can point to the fall in the jobless rate, and the
fact the payrolls would have been higher but for the one-off impact of
Hurricane Andrew and summer jobs programmes, as evidence that economic
conditions are improving, albeit slowly.
Governor Bill Clinton, Bush's rival for the presidency, can argue that with
payrolls, average work week levels and average hourly earnings still
falling, and the national jobless rate two points above its levels of four
years ago, the Republicans have failed miserably in their stewardship of the
economy.
While the politicians were busy working out how to put the most favourable
spin on the jobs figures, investors were giving them (the figures, not the
politicians) an unequivocal thumbs-down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
was 40 points lower by midday as the markets judged the employment report in
terms of what it meant for monetary policy.
Before the report was released, bond prices had been rising on hopes that a
bad employment number would prompt another interest rate cut from the
Federal Reserve. Although stock prices did not join the bond rally, equity
investors shared the same hopes.
The fact that the 57,000 drop in payrolls was about half what analysts had
been forecasting, and that the decline in the unemployment rate was not
anticipated at all, was seen to have dashed those hopes, however.
It was this thinking that sparked the selling on stock markets yesterday.
Equity investors never like bad economic news, except when it leads to an
easing of credit conditions. The jobs news just was not bad enough to
warrant a policy ease, or so investors judged.
Yesterday's selling of stocks, however, may have been a bit premature. The
Fed's key policy- making body, the Open Market Committee, assembles on
Tuesday for its monthly review of economic conditions, and few on Wall
Street are ruling out the possibility that the FOMC will vote at the meeting
to cut rates for the 25th time in the last two years.
Analysts who remain confident that the Fed will ease policy believe the Fed
will take all the recent economic data, and not just the headline-grabbing
employment report, into account before acting.
In the past week alone there has been bad news on construction spending
(down 0.8 per cent in August), consumer confidence (the Conference Board's
index of confidence fell for the third straight month in September), new
home sales (down 6.1 per cent in August in spite of very low mortgage rates)
and from the National Association of Purchasing Management, whose index fell
below 50 last month, an indication that the industrial sector is again
contracting after a long period of modest expansion.
Against such a gloomy background, it is no surprise that stock prices have
gone nowhere in recent months. During the just-ended third quarter the Dow
fell 1.4 per cent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.3 per cent. Those
performances would probably have been worse were it not for the continued
flood of cash into stocks. Yields on comparable fixed- income assets remain
extremely low, so despite a sluggish market investors are switching into
equities in search of higher returns.
The story of the week among individual stocks was Sears. The retailing and
financial services giant finally took the step that shareholders and
analysts have been recommending for years - the company announced it was
selling the bulk of its financial services interests in a demerger that is
expected to raise more than Dollars 3bn in cash, money which will go towards
reducing Sears' debt load.
Sears stock climbed sharply on the news, and the restructuring was initially
well received by shareholders who had long argued that the poor performance
of the retailing side was depressing the market valuation of the company's
much more successful financial services businesses.
By the end of the week, however, Sears shares had given up nearly half of
their initial gains on concern that the plan to spin-off a large part of the
financial services operations would not raise enough money to make the
retailing business a significantly stronger competitor.

FT  03 OCT 92 / A revolution on the Russian airwaves: Ian Hargreaves visited
Moscow's television stations where he found broadcasters who had craved
freedom learning that viewers want US game shows and Mexican soaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE ARE the ratings for Moscow TV: number one, Field of Dreams, a game
show; number two, The Rich Also Cry, a Mexican soap opera; number three,
another Mexican soap. Disney cartoons are at four, with news at five, six
and seven. Russia, it seems, is already a paid-up member of the western
world's armchair society.
'The country is fed up with politicians,' says Yegor Yakovlev, the
62-year-old journalist and biographer of Lenin who for the past year has
been boss of Ostankino, formerly Gostelradio, monopoly broadcaster to the
Soviet Union. 'From 1985 to August 1991, any move away from politics would
have been against the interest of the audience. That period is over.
Politics today takes place in everyday life. The more people realise that,
the more normal the country will become.'
This is a message you hear constantly in the journalistic salons of Moscow.
Those who spent years yearning for the freedom to write without censorship
are recognising that the public demands to be entertained as well as
hectored. As newspaper cover prices soar in response to inflation,
circulations are tumbling and competition intensifying.
It is in television, though, where the struggle is fiercest because in TV
the limits of the broadcasting spectrum combine with the medium's power to
demand that government shapes its future.
Russia thus finds itself addressing, at fast-forward speed, the three big
questions over which the west has disagreed at leisure in the 60 years since
the industry was born. What role will the state play in owning TV stations?
To what extent will it regulate broadcasters it does not own? And how will
TV be financed: through taxation, advertising, a BBC-style licence fee, or a
mixture of all three?
In Moscow, there is also a unique fourth question: to what extent can
Ostankino, state broadcaster to the Russian empire, continue to function
beyond the borders of Russia?
Yakovlev needs no reminding of the heat these questions generate. In July,
Ostankino's once impregnable premises were stormed by communists and
nationalists protesting about their lack of access to the air-waves. 'Our
people were dispersed with sticks,' says Gennadiy Seleznev, editor in chief
of Pravda, the former party newspaper where circulation has collapsed from
its peak of more than 11m to 1.4m and continues to fall. 'All our TV is
one-sided: it's fantastically pro-Yeltsin and pro-government. There is no
culture of opposition in Russia.'
The atmosphere is distinctively post-revolutionary. Those in charge are
mostly those who grabbed effectively in or around August last year when the
anti-Gorbachev coup collapsed. 'We made a big mistake in not demanding more
in terms of buildings and equipment,' says Sergei Skvortsov, deputy general
director of Russian Television, the scruffily housed Moscow station set up
by Yeltsin in 1991 as a rival to Gorbachev's Gostelradio.
The breathless months following the coup's defeat have also left large gaps
in the legal framework. There is, for example, no copyright law although
Professor Mikhail Fedotov, burly director of Yeltsin's intellectual property
agency, says he has a draft in his computer and that Russia will be ready to
sign the Berne convention on copyright next year. Fedotov also has a pair of
handcuffs hanging from his desk lamp as a warning to the pirates. 'Russia is
no Africa,' he bellows.
Western investment advisers say that, without a copyright law, Russia will
remain bandit country, shunned by serious western media money and a haven
for the country's hundreds of cable TV operators, some no more than a VCR
connected through a single apartment block and illicitly showing American
movies.
Russia does have a mass media law, judged widely in Moscow to be
progressive, although it contains clauses on newspaper registration, privacy
and the definition of journalism which some think may yet prove dangerous,
particularly since factions inside parliament continue to talk of a
committee to 'supervise' the media.
Parliament has not, however, got round to serious work on a broadcasting law
to specify either the governance of the state TV companies or a regulatory
framework for independent operators, such as the channel six service
proposed as a 50-50 joint venture by Ted Turner (owner of CNN) and local
interests.
Through the chaos, however, patterns are emerging. The clear leader is
Yakovlev's Ostankino, although many think he has gambled his future
foolishly on trying to retain Ostankino's position as a broadcaster across
the whole of the former Soviet Union where its relatively polished fare is
more popular than the drab, politician-speak nationalism of organisations
such as TV Ukraine.
'I am trying to save the company,' says Yakovlev. 'I dream of preserving a
single information space (for the CIS). That is not just my official duty,
it's my civil duty, my principal task.'
This must rank as one of the more ambitious undertakings in broadcasting
history: to maintain a Moscow-based, Russian language TV service across the
schismatic vastness of the Commonwealth of Independent States. So far,
Yakovlev has obtained provisional agreement to create an interstate joint
stock company, but the matter is still to be debated at a CIS summit next
month.
What he has not received is money, other than from the Russian government
and that part of advertising revenue (10 per cent, he has estimated) which
filters through a corruption-prone system which permits producers of
individual programmes to sell commercial time around their own slots.
Apart from news and soaps, a typical midweek evening on Ostankino's channel
one takes in sport, discussion programmes and films. One popular show, of
which Yakovlev is proud, is called Tema (Themes) and features a US-style
talk show host coaxing a lively studio audience to interrogate suitable
victims.
During my visit, the targets were two entrepreneurs, members of what
Russians call 'the new class.' These men declared themselves in favour of
'the American style' and fielded questions of innocent savagery, such as:
'If you make profits, you take money from others. How can you justify this
morally?' and, 'You sell a Ford car for 2m roubles. I cannot earn this sum
in a lifetime. How can this be right?'
Not all of prime time is this much fun. On a wet Wednesday evening this
month, alongside Ostankino, Russian TV's channel two was offering Opposition
in which the leader of the farmers' union put his view at Gorbachevian
length, followed by The Count of Monte Cristo. A late-night hit for channel
two is the constitutional court's inquisition of the communists.
Moscow TV, funded by the city council, was meanwhile showing dull local
current affairs and St Petersburg TV offered a similar brew. This channel is
most famous for 600 Seconds, a programme which gives vent to communist,
nationalist, monarchist, even anti-semitic views and refers habitually to
Yeltsin's 'government of occupation.' The authorities tried to kill it off
but it was restored after public protest. A fifth channel is an educational
service of a gravitas which would delight the ghost of John Reith.
There is vigorous debate about just how politically free the broadcasters
are. Alexei Salmin, a leading social scientist at the Gorbachev Foundation,
says television offers 'a plurality of organised opinions. This reflects the
pluralism of political power. TV is independent from everybody, including
the government and the parliament, but this is mostly due to the ad hoc
nature of the situation.'
Ostankino is regarded as dull and respectable in its news service, whereas
Russian TV gives a large amount of power to the news anchors, who determine
running orders and write scripts. In the old days, Gostelradio's evening
news was rehearsed in the afternoon to make sure the party bosses were happy
with it.
'There is too much opinion of the anchormen when they should just be
explaining things,' says Vladislav Starkov, editor-in-chief of the booming
weekly Argumenty &amp; Facty where 'real life' journalism attracts 6,000
readers' letters a day.
Inside the TV companies, everyone insists that censorship is gone. Yakovlev
points to three silent phones on his desk which connected his predecessor to
the party. But inside Yeltsin's entourage, I was told that when the
president does a TV spot, the interviewer is selected by the president's
men. At Russian TV, parliament still has the right to insist that its
proceedings interrupt other programmes.
All the broadcasters say life is getting harder. Russia's budgetary problems
have constrained finances and the collapse of the rouble has made foreign
material expensive.
In this ferment, a handful of foreigners pick their way. Turner is the most
ambitious, with his proposed mix of CNN news, children's programmes,
geographical documentaries and films.
'Channel six will help change the selling mentality of Russian television,'
says Bruce Macdonald, Moscow boss of the US-based BBDO advertising and
marketing agency. 'We are on the edge of a massive development in
advertising here. This used to be a country where, to do a deal, you needed
to know three people and hold two alcoholic dinners. Now, it's 15 countries
and 30,000 enterprises. Western advertisers have the chance to block up the
next generation's mentality on a TV system which is, by western standards,
uncluttered and cheap.'
In recent months, the price of a prime time minute has fallen from Dollars
60,000 to Dollars 6,000, which represents perhaps five cents per 1,000
viewers compared with more than Dollars 5 in the US. Among companies which
have joined the fray are Pepsi, Wrigley, Rank Xerox and Avon.
Macdonald is more aware than most of the system's frustrations: the failure
to understand audience targeting, the fact that TV companies do not log
their advertising output, or publish advance schedules, or research the
ratings properly. 'There are one hell of a lot of exclusive agents,' he
warns. 'Their deals are exclusive till tomorrow lunchtime, and the money can
easily end up in a Swiss bank account rather than at Ostankino.'
Thus, as Russian TV points its cameras at society, what viewers see is an
exotic pluralism let loose around a staid, statist formalism - just as
Moscow's vast roads and grave institutional buildings have become a backdrop
for a teeming kerbside market in which everyone has something to sell.
'Commercial TV development so far has not been good,' says Yakovlev. 'A lot
of it is in bad taste and of low quality, reflecting the desire of those
running it to make as much money as possible as quickly as possible. Perhaps
such TV equates with our society now.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / The Long View: Share prices enjoy floating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT HAS been an up-and-down year for the UK equity market but the FT-SE 100
Index passed the three-quarters mark this week showing a net capital gain of
about 2 per cent since the beginning of January, and a total return
including gross dividends of some 6 per cent.
That compares well with a nine-month return of about zero on overseas
equities but not so impressively with perhaps 9 per cent on long-dated
gilt-edged and nearly 8 per cent on risk-free wholesale money market
deposits.
In spite of the dreary overall performance of the stock market this year,
and indeed over the past five years, there is still a formidable marketing
structure in Britain geared to promoting equity-based products such as
with-profits life insurance contracts, unit trusts and personal equity
plans. And company pension schemes continue to bet as heavily as ever on an
equity market revival.
In these circumstances, given the right kind of signal, the market will
surge. Two such green lights have flashed this year, when the Conservatives
unexpectedly won the election in April and when sterling tumbled out of the
ERM last month. Curiously, both of these rallies have totalled 14.9 per cent
in terms of the Footsie. In between, however, the grim underlying reality of
economic recession and corporate distress has dragged share prices back.
The City of London's hordes of analysts have repeatedly failed to get to
grips with the seriousness of the industrial situation. The big brokers,
naturally, are at the very forefront of the equity promotion effort. It is
hard for them ever to be bearish, especially when it is clear that on any
plausible excuse the market will suddenly leap ahead by 10 or 15 per cent.
But some major brokers were suggesting with quite amazing optimism at the
end of last year that company earnings per share would rocket by 20 or 25
per cent this year and dividends would continue to rise by 5 per cent or so.
In fact profit expectations are continuing to be deflated - there was a big
downgrade by ICI's official corporate brokers this week, for instance. And
although devaluation will boost the sterling value of overseas profits it is
the dollar, which is the key currency here; even last night sterling was
down by no more than 8 per cent against the dollar since December 31.
Meanwhile dividends on the All-Share Index are at present showing a
year-on-year fall of 1 per cent and it was worrying to see a mainstream
company like Sears slashing its payout by more than a third this week. A
whole swathe of big British companies may decide that their dividends are
out of line with their reasonable expectations for earnings.
Conceivably, dividends overall could drop significantly in 1993. Certainly
forecasts by some analysts of dividend growth of 5 per cent, or even more,
seem quite unrealistic.
The continuing upward drift in gilt-edged yields, now approaching 9 1/2 per
cent and heading for 10 per cent according to several leading bond broking
houses, is also a threat.
When the UK entered the ERM two years ago share prices initially soared
because of expectations that gilt yields would fall and therefore equity
yields would fall too (that is, share prices would rise) because in recent
history the ratio of the two yields had never fallen below 2. In fact the
ERM was very negative for company profits and dividends, which was
eventually recognised in a decline in the yield ratio to little more than
1.7 at one point this summer.
With our exit from the ERM the reverse logic applies. Share prices have
justifiably jumped, because the overseas operations and exports of
London-quoted companies are worth more in terms of sterling. On the other
hand, rising bond yields pose a threat.
For the time being the yield ratio can take the strain (it has risen to
1.96). But a combination of a 10 per cent gilt yield and a prospective
equity dividend yield below the current 4.8 per cent could begin to make the
lights flash red.
For the time being, though, the market could benefit from some positive
factors. It is possible (if far from certain, given sterling's continuing
weakness) that short-term interest rates could fall further. This could
encourage private investors to switch from building society accounts into
the stock market, in a small-scale British version of the American
phenomenon that has kept Wall Street so high this year.
Institutional investors could also be flush with cash. There is a dearth of
new equity issues, and the government has financed much of its borrowing
requirement out of the reserves and through foreign currency borrowing.
There is a window opening which might allow share prices to go higher.
I am much more worried about next year, however. A modest devaluation-based
economic revival could begin, putting pressure on sterling and interest
rates. The cyclical forces which have been favouring the equity market may
begin to act against it.
In these circumstances the private sector may begin to be 'crowded out': the
government may well need to sell Pounds 40bn or more of gilts next year, and
although foreigners were buying up half the gilt issues while the UK was in
the ERM they are unlikely to play more than an occasional speculative role
while sterling floats.
There are the makings of big trouble here, and the government has to realise
that a public sector deficit that was financeable within the ERM might not
be tolerable outside. True, at the same time there will be much more scope
to tighten fiscal policy and relax monetary policy, reducing the torrent of
gilts and taking some of the pressure off the stock market.
Yet there cannot be much confidence in this government's ability to conceive
and implement tricky shifts of strategy.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Another large fall for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING plunged nearly 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday after the
Bundesbank failed to cut rates as many dealers had expected, writes James
Blitz.
Yesterday was the day the market has been waiting for all week, with the
Bundesbank council meeting and the September non-farm payroll figure in the
US. In the end, neither event yielded great changes. The Bundesbank did not
cut rates, but made more accommodating noises on policy. The headline
payroll figure was down 57,000, far less than had been expected, but the
underlying gloom over the US economy remained.
The net result was to leave the dollar weak in the afternoon, pushing it
down to a close of DM1.4085 from a previous DM1.4255. In the European
exchange rate mechanism, the unrelieved pressure of German interest rates
forced down the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo, while the Irish
punt was again reported to have touched its ERM floor.
In this turbulent European sea, sterling stands out as the one major
currency which is not anchored by an exchange rate discipline, an economic
policy or a steady government. It was besieged by the wildest rumours
yesterday, including the idea that Moody's rating agency was about to
down-grade the UK's foreign debt.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation, said that the
pound had come under pressure from short-term interbank dealing rather than
the off-loading of bonds and currency by big institutional investors. That
would probably explain why the currency sprang back to DM2.44 in
post-European trading from a low of DM2.4260. It closed in London at
DM2.4300, 11.5 pfennigs down on the week.
But Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation said that sterling's fall was 'disturbing.' Neither the size of
the fall, nor the speed, had been anticipated. 'There were simply no buyers
for the currency at any price during the afternoon,' he said.
At the end of another turbulent week in the markets, much uncertainty
remains.
Mr O'Neill is bearish about the dollar and believes that it could easily go
below the historic low of DM1.3860. 'The payroll figure was regarded as
good, because people had expected so much worse,' he said. 'But the weak US
economy and political uncertainty in the US will push the dollar down.'
The Bundesbank President's comment that interest rates will remain steady
for the 'time being' hangs over the Spanish peseta. Yesterday the Spanish
government raised its intervention rate by 1 per cent as the peseta fell to
a close of 71.32 against the D-Mark, very near its ERM floor of 72.62.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Money Markets: New gloom on rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES in the sterling cash market firmed yesterday afternoon as the pound
fell sharply against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
In the absence of a cut in German interest rates or any clear economic
policy from the UK government, the pound lost nearly 5 pfennigs against the
D-Mark.
Until yesterday, several money market dealers had been assuming that there
could be another cut in UK base rates announced at next week's Conservative
party conference to boost the government's fortunes. According to one
discount house director, that cut seems less likely.
'The government has made a complete hash of it,' he said. 'If they had cut
base rates earlier this week, sterling would not have suffered much. Now,
the cost of a rate cut next week will be another big fall in the currency.'
Even so, the impact on rates and prices was smaller than might have been
expected. Three-month money in the sterling cash market rose to 9 1/16 per
cent from a previous close of 9 per cent on Thursday night. The December
short sterling contract closed down 13 basis points at 91.72, taking a less
bullish view of a rate cut before the end of the year.
The reaction to the Bundesbank council meeting across Europe was markedly
different. Although there was no change in rates, dealers were encouraged by
the central bank's decision to change the way it offers securities
repurchase funds to the banking system by setting two-week tenders rather
than the traditional one- or two-month pacts.
Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, also raised hopes of some
change in the bank's policy on rates by saying that the recent currency
intervention meant that German M3 money supply data were no longer as valid
as they had been. The December Euro-Deutschmark contract rose 16 basis
points to close at 91.70.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn and purchased Pounds
34m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 150m in a repurchase
agreement (repo) at 8 15/16 per cent. The forecast was later revised to
Pounds 1.2bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 247m in Band 1, Pounds 416m in
Band 2 at 8 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 140m in the 'repo.' Late assistance was
Pounds 10m.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Big drop in house prices blamed on Pounds crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE prices staged their biggest monthly fall for almost a year in
September, according to Nationwide, Britain's biggest building society.
It blamed the sterling crisis and the ending of stamp duty concessions in
August for the decline.
Average prices fell by 1.4 per cent in September compared with the previous
month, Nationwide said. The previous biggest monthly fall was 2.4 per cent
last October.
It was the fourth month in succession that prices had fallen, the society
said. The rate of decline, however, had reduced over the summer and prices
appeared to be stabilising.
According to Nationwide, on average house prices have fallen by more than 6
per cent in the past 12 months. In parts of southern England prices have
fallen by more than 30 per cent since 1988-89.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst for UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said
that even taking into account special factors, last month's fall was deeply
disappointing. 'Every time prices decline people stay out of the market
believing that prices may fall further. The more they stay out, the more
likely it is that prices will fall,' he said.
Mr John Hutchinson, Nationwide's corporate strategy director, said the
turmoil in currency and interest rate markets meant that September was not a
good guide to longer term price trends.
The ending of the stamp duty holiday on August 19 for houses costing less
than Pounds 250,000 meant that many people had brought purchases forward,
'leaving a vacuum in September'.
The response of potential housebuyers has been mixed in the two weeks since
Britain announced sterling's suspension within the ERM, say estate agents.
Mr David Goodchild, associate director of Aitchisons estate agents in south
Hertfordshire, said: 'In Watford and Berkhamstead there has been a sharp
increase in people wanting to view properties. In Hemel Hempstead and St
Albans, close to Hatfield where British Aerospace has just announced 3,000
redundancies, the market remains as depressed as ever.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / Sterling hits new D-Mark low: Major reopens row over
realignment - Bundesbank dashes hope of rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING hit a new low yesterday against the D-Mark, as Germany's Bundesbank
dashed hopes that it might lower interest rates.
The pound's weakness continued as Mr John Major, the prime minister,
reopened the war of words with the German authorities by denying that they
had requested a realignment of sterling within the European exchange rate
mechanism on the weekend before Black Wednesday.
The Treasury believes a note from the Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, published earlier this week, implied the bank sought
realignment of several currencies that weekend, September 11-12.
Mr Major, replying to a demand from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for an
explanation of events surrounding sterling's suspension in the ERM, wrote:
'Apart from Italy, I do not know whether the German authorities contacted
any countries that weekend and pressed them to realign.
'What I do know - and what the chancellor of the exchequer has made clear -
is that the German authorities made no request to the United Kingdom that
sterling should realign.'
The prime minister's reply did not cover the possibility that the Bundesbank
had requested a realignment before that weekend.
Mr Major also pointed out that 'all the intervention that the Bundesbank has
undertaken must be financed by the Bank of England'.
Earlier, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had warned
that the government could not use sterling's suspension from the ERM to
allow the currency to go into free fall.
Mr Heseltine also echoed a warning earlier this week from Mr Major that the
government could not rule out tax increases next year if spending and the
deficit are not held in check.
The Treasury said the Bank of England's reserves fell by an underlying
Pounds 4.4bn last month as a result of heavy intervention by the UK
authorities in the vain effort to prop up sterling ahead of suspension from
the ERM.
The sharp fall in sterling gave an awkward jolt to Mr Norman Lamont's
preparations for what promises to be a critical Tory party conference for
the chancellor in Brighton next week.
Investors switched funds out of pounds and into D-Marks after Mr Schlesinger
said that the Bundesbank would keep its main credit rates steady for the
'time being'.
Mr Schlesinger said German credit rates were not unduly high given the
pressures of unification. Speaking after a meeting of the central bank's
council in Schwerin, eastern Germany, he revealed that total Bundesbank
intervention since the beginning of September to support weak ERM currencies
had totalled DM92bn (Pounds 36.8bn).
The Bundesbank's lack of action on interest rates was the main factor behind
the pound shedding 4 1/2 pfennigs yesterday to a close in London of DM2.43,
an 11 1/2 pfennig loss on the week. At last night's level, sterling is more
than 50 pfennigs below its former central ERM rate of DM2.95.
Pressure on sterling was exacerbated by continuing uncertainties about how
the UK intends to operate economic policy after the debacle of ERM
suspension.
The prospect of higher borrowing costs next year would raise further doubts
over Mr Lamont's future as chancellor. He already faces an uphill task in
persuading party activists next Thursday, when he is due to deliver his
conference speech, that the government still has a coherent economic
strategy.
As concern about the economy spilled over to equities, the FT-SE 100 index
of leading UK shares slipped 22.6 for a close of 2,549.7. The fall in prices
on the London market was helped by a decline on Wall Street, where the Dow
Jones Industrial Averageclosed down 53.76 at 3,200.61.
Elsewhere in Europe the effect of the lack of movement on German interest
rates added to pressures on some of the weak ERM currencies, particularly
the Portuguese escudo and the Irish punt.
The Bank of Spain was forced to increase its daily intervention borrowing
rate from 13 per cent to 14 per cent as the peseta fell to a close of 71.32
against the D-Mark, very near its ERM floor of 72.62.
The Bundesbank's council's decision to maintain its main credit rates
disappointed many investors who had been looking for an easing in monetary
policy to help the overall European economy.
The Bundesbank last reduced its rates, after being under intense
international pressure, on September 14.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Battle lines drawn for Commons debate on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY Euro-sceptics yesterday took up the challenge offered by Mr John
Major's determination to ratify the Maastricht treaty by pledging a war of
attrition against the government once the legislation returns to the House
of Commons.
As the Labour party signalled that it would oppose any move by Mr Major to
'guillotine', or limit discussion, on the legislation, the Euro-sceptics
promised an avalanche of amendments as part of a wrecking campaign.
Some will demand a referendum while others will aim to qualify ratification
of the treaty by demanding additional parliamentary approval if it results
in the transfer of powers to Brussels.
The prime minister's move to reassert his authority on the subject of Europe
marked the start of a protracted tactical battle between government whips
and the rebel MPs over the legislation. The first encounter will be the
planned debate on the principle of ratification later this month. That will
be followed at the turn of the year by the much longer line-by-line debate.
As Mr Major worked on his speech to the Conservative party conference next
Friday in Brighton, ministers stepped up the offensive to rally all but the
hardened Euro-sceptics behind his stand. The whips meanwhile were promising
what one admitted would be a 'ruthless' campaign to isolate the opponents.
But the Tory rebels were cheered by Labour's commitment to fight any
government attempt to curtail debate. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's
deputy leader, said yesterday that it would be 'outrageous' for ministers to
try to impose a guillotine.
There were signs that the Lib-eral Democrats' pro-European stance might not
prevent them opposing a guillotine. That would put the government's majority
of 21 severely at risk. The Euro-sceptics are convinced that unless the
government can limit debate, the bill will be lost.
Government whips, however, are already working on ways to detach the less
committed rebels.
By contrast, the Euro-sceptics claim that while some of the 80 Tory MPs who
signed a Commons motion calling for a 'fresh start' on Europe after the
Danish referendum result have bowed to pressure from the whips, a large
proportion are prepared to hold firm. They will seek to table emergency
motions at the party conference to rally support for their stance.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAir, the US airline in which British Airways wants to invest Dollars 750m
for a large minority stake, has hit back at opposition from other big US
carriers to the proposed alliance, saying the deal is both legal and
competition-enhancing.
'Our proposal is pure-and-simple a business transaction,' said Mr Seth
Schofield, USAir's chief executive, in response to a press conference held
by the 'big three' US carriers on Thursday, publicising their objections to
the BA-USAir tie-up.
'It meets every requirement and stipulation of US law and should be judged
on those merits alone.'
US rules prohibit foreigners from owning more than 49 per cent of a domestic
airline's shares or over 25 per cent of the voting stock.
The BA investment would fall within these limits, but the rival US carriers
argue that provisions attracted to the deal would give BA effective control
over USAir.
Mr Schofield, however, noted that the heavily loss-making US airline
industry has already lost over 100,000 jobs in the past few years. 'The Big
Three have not saved those jobs,' he said, 'and blocking USAir's arrangement
with British Airways will threaten even more jobs.
USAir could face more immediate problems, if a ballot among its 8,000-plus
mechanics results in a proposed labour contract being turned down.
Balloting was continuing yesterday, but if the contract is rejected, strike
action - recommended by the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers - could be taken.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: NS cuts rates on savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Savings has announced cuts of between 0.75 and a full percentage
point in the interest it offers on fixed-rate savings products. The Building
Societies' Association welcomed the move and said it would ease pressure
further on mortgage rates.
The launch in July of the First Option bond, which offers a fixed rate over
one year with tax paid, brought protests from societies, which said it was
impossible to match.
The initial rate for the bond, of 10.34 per cent gross, prompted the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester society to raise its mortgage rate. This was
followed by a cut in the bond's gross interest rate of 0.67 points.
The gross interest on the bond has been cut by a full percentage point to
8.67 per cent and no longer poses such a competitive threat to building
society deposits. Similar cuts were made to National Savings' more
traditional products.
The new 39th issue savings certificates guarantee a tax-free return of 6.75
per cent after five years; the 38th issue paid 7.5 per cent. Certificates
for the 39th issue will be sold in units of Pounds 100 rather than Pounds
25, a denomination in which certificates have been available since 1981.
This also should lessen the pressure on societies.
Series E capital bonds, which offered 10 per cent gross, have been withdrawn
and replaced by Series F bonds which offer 9 per cent. The new issue D of
children's bonus bonds will also see a cut of one percentage point, from
10.1 to 9.1.
The overall return on a five-year Yearly Plan will be 6.75 per cent,
compared with 7.5. No change has been made to index-linked certificates.
All these products will be available direct from National Savings from
Monday but they will not be obtainable from post offices until Thursday,
October 15.

the clients happy - In its complex commercial operations, Arts Council Films
can now track people, companies, events and the entire sales cycle / Arts
Council Films; User view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TEBBUTT

<TEXT>
TO AVOID saying the wrong thing to sensitive and highly-valued clients, Arts
Council Films provided its negotiators with a Market-Base sales and
marketing database system.
The organisation, a commercial department within the Arts Council of Great
Britain, matches the arts programme requirements of the international
television broadcasting industry with the plans and outputs of independent
producers. Sometimes this leads to film purchases, at others it leads to
funding for new films.
The negotiators maintain two separate databases, one for broadcasters, the
other for producers.
Every significant detail of every conversation between Arts Council Films
and its clients, on both sides of the fence, is recorded in Market-Base.
This ensures that no-one makes the mistake of trying to sell a film that has
already been rejected, or by pursuing a prospect who has little interest in
the subject matter. Before the databases were created, the organisation
relied on a collection of well-thumbed A4 notebooks. Mistakes happened and
customers' confidence took a knock each time.
Now, Market-Base ensures that such mistakes cannot happen. Even at an
overseas show, such as the Cannes TV film festival, staff from Arts Council
Films carry the databases around in a portable computer.
Market-Base enables the sales team to plot every moment of a sales cycle,
from initial interest to final purchase.
Groups of records can be identified for mail shots. Something simple, like
'all men,' would be done automatically but something more complicated like
'all companies who would be interested in a programme about the Grateful
Dead and modern composers' would prove more difficult.
Because the databases contain only 1,000 people spread around 420
organisations, it is easier to tag prospects by hand. Whenever a new film or
a proposal needs customers or sponsors, a master mailing letter is written
within Market-Base and the mailing set printed automatically, getting name
and address details from the tagged records.
Before deciding on Market-Base, Arts Council Films seriously considered
jointly developing a sales and marketing system with two other companies
with similar interests.
It also considered a Macintosh-based system. In the end, a consulting firm
was hired to evaluate the organisation's needs and to identify the best
product. Interestingly, the consultancy fee was much higher than the cost of
implementing Market-Base.
The four-user network version and a single user version for the portable
machine cost Pounds 3,600.
Market-Base was chosen because it most closely matched the organisation's
need to track people, companies, events and the entire sales cycle.
The other big benefit was that the Arts Council itself was able to tailor
the screen and the reports to exactly meet its needs.
Richard Gooderick of the Arts Council, who is responsible for buying the
system, advises users to implement their systems piecemeal - 'some aspects
of Market-Base have proved much more useful than I expected.'
He adds: 'It doesn't matter how much time you spend beforehand, it's only
when the system is working that you discover its real capabilities.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Arts: Isaacs to stay at Covent Garden - The Arts Council has
temporarily let the Royal Opera House off the hook, but redevelopment and
public funding problems remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After months of rumour and recrimination the Arts Council report into the
running of the Royal Opera House was released yesterday in a truncated and
bland form. There is nothing in the findings to rattle the management at
Covent Garden.
Not surprisingly, the Covent Garden Board has announced that Jeremy Isaacs
has had his contract as general director extended for another two years. He
will finally quit at the end of the 1994-95 season when he will be 63. He
was looking for a three year extension, but even so Isaacs' overall position
has been secured.
The Arts Council Committee, chaired by Lady Warnock, criticises the Royal
Opera House for running up a deficit which is now approaching Pounds 4m; for
making artistic decisions first and worrying about the cost later; for
failing to push through the productivity improvements recommended in the
1983 Priestley Report; and for generally poor management and bad staff
relations. It also suggests that the Birmingham Royal Ballet should, in
time, become a wholly separate organisation.
But Warnock acknowledges the pre-eminent position of Covent Garden;
generally approves of the artistic performances in the past season; and
confirms that the Royal Opera House should continue to receive substantial
public funding.
As well as the Arts Council investigation, the Royal Opera House asked the
consultants Price Waterhouse to conduct an independent investigation into
its working practices. Its findings do not greatly differ and it recommends
cost savings of over Pounds 1m a year. The Board has set up a sub-committee
which will study in detail the two reports and come up with conclusions and
recommendations in the near future.
There is one glaring area of dispute between the Royal Opera House and the
Arts Council. The Warnock Committee considered that Covent Garden's large
scale Pounds 250m re-development plan, which will involve the Opera House
raising Pounds 90m and closing the house for at least two years, should be
abandoned in the face of the collapsed property market and the current
financial crisis of Covent Garden. It suggested a less ambitious project,
sufficient to improve the antique and dangerous back stage conditions.
But the Board intends to carry on with its redevelopment appeal. It will
quietly try to get pledges from business and individuals before approaching
the Government for a top-up grant, presumably from Lottery money. Jeremy
Isaacs will wish to get the closure and rebuilding programme settled before
his reign ends.
The Arts Council has to a great extent let the Royal Opera House off the
hook. It approved the summary of the findings of the Warnock report released
yesterday but has made it clear that much of the report's content was more
highly critical. It is adamant that unless the Opera House eliminates its
deficit over the next three years the Arts Council will reduce its subsidy.
It will expect substantial management changes at Covent Garden in the very
near future and a much greater commitment to efficiency and economy.
After all the fuss of recent months it will be surprising if the Royal Opera
House does not realise that it has been given one last chance to put its
house in order. But the key issue still does not seem to be grasped. Covent
Garden is under-funded in comparison with every other leading European opera
house. That is why it has been forced to raise seat prices to unacceptable
levels in recent years. There is nothing in the Warnock summary which
relates to seat prices. These can only be reduced if the Arts Council gives
more subsidy or if it accepts a lower level of performance.
Price Waterhouse suggests that in future some of the Arts Council's subsidy
should be earmarked for reducing seat prices. That at least approaches the
heart of the matter.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (31): Exemplary
features - Consultant's Critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFICIENCY and charity are often felt to be poles apart. The processes of
business are usually portrayed as hard and uncaring - especially the world
of direct mail. The Children's Society faces the dilemma of what business it
is actually in: is it a charity that depends on spontaneous generosity or is
it a fundraising operation?
If the former, is it ethical to use tools like database profiling and
targetted mail shots? Should the charity simply pray and trust that 'God
will provide' or does 'the Lord help those who help themselves'?
There are no easy answers to this sort of question. What the Children's
Society has tried to do is to use all the resources available in support of
its overall goal - to help children.
It uses its IT framework to support the whole realm of fundraising
activities while still recognising that people are of supreme importance.
The society recognises human frailties, such as the accurate filling in of
forms - traditionally a nightmare. All the activities are voluntary, so the
society has no sanction over its collectors.
As a result, it has to have elabo- rate compensatory systems in place, such
as the 'scrawly signatures' book. The most striking feature of this case for
me was the excellent use of consultants. The Children's Society had
recognised that it was not a software house, nor should it become one. Thus,
it hired an outside consultant to design and carry through the initial
implementation. Once the system was complete, the specialist skills of Mr
Pritchard were no longer needed and he was released.
Far too many companies use consultants for too short a period and never
allow them to use their skills. Alternatively, they treat consultants like
junior permanent staff and give them tasks to do which they could easily do
themselves at lower cost.
Another exemplary feature was the management of change demonstrated by Mr
Beschizza. He described the initial phase as 'an arm round the shoulder'
style of operation. Users were introduced to the computer as a tool not as
an enemy and they were given lots of support.
The final word on efficiency has to be the fact that both reporters left
carrying a collecting box.
Key points to note:
Correct use of consultants' skills
Full support and training of users during implementation
Commitment from all levels of the operation.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (41): Keeping in
touch with decision-makers - Facilities management supplier; User view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TEBBUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AST Transact likes to keep tabs on the key decision-makers and influential
people in some of Britain's largest financial institutions, writes David
Tebbutt. The company, majority-owned by the Royal Bank of Canada, is a
supplier of facilities management and high value software products. It uses
Market-Base to manage both mailshots and the sales process.
The company is taking a phased approach to implementation, starting with the
facilities management prospect and customer details.
The system currently contains 400 to 500 records; in total, the system is
expected to reach 1,500 researched prospects. One of the early tasks is to
mail a copy of AST's own City FM magazine to senior personnel of companies
which use IBM mainframe computers. All recipients will be addressed by name
and have a personalised letter included.
Before Market-Base, the company used ButtonWare's PC-File. This was
restricted to three contacts per company. The company also tried using
TeleMagic with one product.
Richard Wright, an AST business development manager, looked at a number of
sales and marketing systems before settling on Market-Base. He describes it
as, 'user-friendly, easy to learn and easy to use.'
He also admits that Kensington Marketing Services, its publisher, 'did an
extremely good job of selling the product. They were straight, and they
answered the questions of the whole department.'
He liked the fact that the database was hierarchical and could handle
multiple company contacts. He also liked the program's sales forecasting and
analysis capabilities, both numerical and textual. The standard reports are
not suitable but, using the Clarion report writer, Mr Wright is able to
tailor-make reports to the company's needs.
Kensington Marketing Systems helped with installing the system on a network
and on a portable PC. The supplier also converted the data files from PC
File and TeleMagic. At the moment, any three out of the 12 network users can
use Market-Base at the same time.
The system cost AST Transact Pounds 2,500 for the three-user network version
and a single-user copy for a portable computer. Mr Wright's advice to
would-be buyers of sales and marketing systems is, 'if you have no
experience of databases, use a consultant. Otherwise, the more you look at,
the more confused you'll become.'
He also suggests: 'Have a clear idea of what you want - some programs will
do too much, others will do too little.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (38): Wish you were
here - Holiday club streamlines its mailshots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO, these days, takes their time off in a holiday camp? Information
technology staff of Holiday Club Pontins have started work on a system that
will answer that question in exact detail, writes Claire Gooding.
The survey's findings will rely not on popular mythology, but on the exact
science offered by GB mailing, a postcode-based marketing database.
Holiday Club Pontins - part of the Pounds 80m Scottish and Newcastle Leisure
Division - runs clubs at 22 locations around the southern and north-western
coast of the UK, plus outposts in Cork and Jersey. In the high season, its
team of 400 staff can swell to more than 4,000.
What is constant - according to marketing manager Pamela Knight - is the
clientele: 'We do a great deal of long-term and repeat business. Our
business is people; making sure they enjoy themselves is inherent in our
company policy. Better service to our customers is a priority.'
Part of this better service includes communicating with customers more
effectively, in Ms Knight's words, 'making sure they get the information
they require, at the time they require it, but not in duplicate.'
A problem was that Pontins data contained and duplications and discrepancies
that made it impossible to determine exactly who was who. Duplications were
inevitable because of slightly differing occurrences of the same name at one
address, sourced from holidays taken at different locations and times.
Pontins sought a packaged solution that would work on the IBM AS400 computer
 -which its information technology staff have used since 1987  - and found
only one: GB Mailing. This product has enabled Pontins to make sense of its
data with its technique of assigning a unique identification system, based
on postcodes. GB Postcoder allocates the postcode to addresses, making sure
that the mail qualifies for bulk postal discounts. The Addressplus facility
even generates all the address details, bar house-number and addressee's
name.
Each system update, every six months or so, costs Pounds 1,000: the original
price, at implementation in November 1991, was Pounds 11,495.
Pontins uses the system only on its own data, drawn from past and current
guests. The main benefits havebeen the improved accuracy of mailshots to the
750,000 names on the database, with the spin-off of telemarketing. Bookings
over the phone are now much faster and easier for both Pontins and the
customers.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (28): Computing
with a conscience - Claire Gooding finds out how a marketing database system
makes fund-raising more cost-effective Case Study; The Children's Society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUFFERING of children has always wrung tender hearts, and won pennies
from pockets. But in a recession, the Children's Society has to work harder
than usual to fund its work among children of all races and religions, and
to keep down its administrative costs.
The marketing database system recently put in place by the information
technology (IT) staff at the Society's Marjory Street headquarters in
central London is designed to make fund-raising cost-effective.
'We had three problems to solve,' explains direct mail manager Roger
Beschizza. 'First, we needed to make our IT cost-effective.
'Secondly, we wanted to maintain and improve our marketing ability.
'Thirdly, we wanted to integrate the various incompatible systems into one.'
Like most charities, the Children's Society relies heavily on donations,
(see the society snapshot, facing page). Its administration and
fund-raising, however, is sharply divided from its 'core business' of
helping disadvantaged children - runaways, refugees, and other troubled or
abandoned children.
Even the whereabouts of its two London 'safe homes' for runaways, (to which
the police turn a benevolent blind eye), are unknown to the staff at its
central London headquarters.
Although changing social structures have made many orphanages redundant,
there are currently 146 projects, including residential centres for those
with disabilities, centres for children coming out of care, family centres,
and refuges for drug abusers.
The prefix, 'Church of England' has been downgraded in the charity's title,
because, as press officer Liz Spenser explains: 'We're for everybody. We
deal with Muslim and Somali refugees - any families or children who come to
our door.'
However, members of the Anglican Church still provide the greater part of
funds and supporters. Donations derive from cash collection boxes, and
carefully targeted fundraising campaigns, such as the Jester fun events in
April, and the recent Great Cake Bake. At headquarters, the emphasis is on
fund-raising and channelling funds. Last February, the search started for a
system that would bring all operations in-house, converting from the service
then based at the Axciom bureau.
'It was a typical bureau situation,' explains Mr Beschizza. 'There was a
geographical distance and a technical distance between what we needed and
what the bureau was able to provide.'
THE Society was looking for a much faster response time, versatility, and
better quality of data. After looking at 20 possible solutions, three were
left on the shortlist. The decisions on the new technology were made by an
IT steering group which drew staff from different divisions, with the help
of an independent consultant, Iain Pritchard, who was absorbed into the
Children's Society full-time for a year.
The process translated Roger Beschizza's 'wish list' into technical
requirements, including such elements as the computer's response time. Mr
Pritchard's final recommendation was to run two packaged software products
from CMG Business Systems on an IBM RS/ 6000 minicomputer under the Unix
operating system. The marketing database product, Infobase, links to
Fact2000 integrated accounts, and CMG's tailoring included a bridge to the
existing PC-based local area networks, running standard PC tool for
wordprocessing, spreadsheets, electronic mail and desktop publishing.
There was a massive conversion effort to sort out the existing data. The
original bureau lists contained 500,000 names and addresses, comprising
supporter and contact database, spontaneous donors, regular commitments,
appeals committees, projects and companies.
Although the job of preserving data integrity never ends, the system has
taken around a year to settle down. It took twice as long to implement as
the six months Mr Beschizza expected. Now, according to David McKee, the
operations manager, they ready to start the next phase of making the data
more useful corporately.
The conversion of the IBM mainframe formatted information from Axciom's
bureau (which the Society still uses for some purposes) was surprisingly
smooth, although the results still had to be combed, qualified and tested -
'it doesn't matter how perfect the conversion technique, there will always
be glitches in the data,' comments Mr McKee.
'The conversion program itself was 7,000 lines of code, so some
imperfections were inevitable. It wasn't until we had all the data in-house
and started working on it that we could see for ourselves exactly what was
there. Before, we were working in the dark.'
The Infobase database and the Facts 2000 accounting system are linked to
other administrative functions, such as word processing, so that donations
can be posted through accounts, with a note made on the contacts database,
and the name and address transferred automatically to Wordperfect for the
creation of 'thank you' letters and acknowlegements. There are several
different lists, such as the 'box lists' for the holders of collection
boxes, and others for area organisers, or active fund-raisers.
It is by painstaking attention to detail that the Children's Society has
built up its lists. There are of course some problems computers simply
cannot solve; poring over indecipherable signatures takes time. A reference
book of 'recognised' scrawls helps with the mystery giro slips which come in
on a regular basis from area organisers. Often the only source of
information accompanying a donation is a barely legible handwritten address
or signature, from the hand of an elderly, perhaps visually-impaired donor.
These letters are more difficult, as the supervisor of central processing,
Sheila Gay, explains: 'A Pounds 10 donation in someone's memory has to be
acknowledged, just as much as the larger amounts from fund-raising events.
That person might be a regular donor, or become one - or even consider
putting a bequest in his or her will.'
Ms Gray and her colleagues go to considerable lengths to establish correct
name and address information, particularly for donations over Pounds 100.
They also search indefatigably for postcodes, in a quest that will qualify
the direct mailshots for a Mailsort discount.
All such information now goes onto the database, which records the
activities, donations and original point of contact for each person on it.
Six months down the line, the data problems are less fundamental, more
cosmetic, and Mr McKee is more concerned with de-duplication, more with the
ability to do 'soundex' of fuzzy-match searches. It is not possible to
discover and keep details, such as age, which might allow accurate profiling
of the database, but even so, initial efforts to analyse the data have
yielded valuable information.
For instance, in a recent analysis, Roger Beschizza was surprised to find
how many of the collection boxholders were also economically active
credit-card holders. A profile of 'the typical donor' will be easier to
establish now the data is reliable - 'we came out of darkness, and into the
light - to use a Biblical phrase . . . we're now in a much better position
to use data in a way that's useful to us, rather than the way the bureau
could have provided it.'
The big benefit for the Children's Society is that it now has one database,
accessible by everybody and working more or less in real time, instead of
the out-of-date microfiches that were once their mainstay.
'That's a big plus. The spin-offs are that people support one another
because they are all working on the same system, with the same data,' he
says.
Mr Beschizza is now preparing to increase the level of science he uses in
targeting his various support groups, using his new database in management
decision-making - 'if I have a word of advice, it is: 'Get the people at the
top to own the system, make sure that everyone uses and owns it; get people
involved early in the consultation process.' '
This process, he suggests, makes staff feel more valued and reassured,
especially if they are facing technology for the first time. Going live was
traumatic for those unused to interactive computing, although, in the event,
disaster-free. He describes it as an 'arm round the shoulder operation,
requiring lots of comfort and reassurance.'
'It takes careful management of people's expectations. And it's very easy to
forget where you came from, and all the hurdles you've already conquered.
Now, we are all talking the same language, and we all understand one
anothers' systems.'
The Children's Society's contemporary attitude to raising funds is evident
in its use of IT for cost-effective operations. Nor does it miss a chance to
add to its 'soft' asset, the database.
By the end of the visit, there were two more economically-active adults on
the list as collection-box holders. For an organisation which admits it
still has some way to go in sophisticated marketing, supplying 'freebies'
that actually woo money from the recipients' pockets is no mean feat.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Daf close to securing loans of
Fl 210m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAF, the loss-making Dutch commercial vehicles maker, repeated yesterday
that it was close to securing Fl 210m (Dollars 130m) in loans from a Dutch
and a Belgian bank.
The company's assurances were issued yesterday afternoon to counter a string
of adverse stock market rumours that had knocked its shares to an all-time
low in early trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
Daf, which is 16 per cent owned by British Aerospace, said speculation that
it was facing payments difficulties were totally unfounded.
It also denied that the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which has been
handling the request for a state-backed loan, was opposed to the company's
recent moves to explore possible strategic links with foreign industrial
partners. Daf is known to be holding talks with both Daimler-Benz of Germany
and with Hino Motors of Japan.
Shares in Daf fell by Fl 2.60 to a low of Fl 12.60 in morning trading before
recovering to Fl 13.60 mid-session. They later closed at Fl 13.20, down 13.2
per cent on the day.
Daf said that the Fl 100m subordinated loan from the Dutch National
Investment Bank would carry conversion rights into ordinary shares and would
have a life of 6.5 years. A loan agreement is expected to be signed in the
next few days, it added.
It is also close to agreement with NMKN, a Belgian bank, on a Fl 110m
non-subordinated loan which would largely be guaranteed by authorities in
the Flemish part of Belgium, where Daf owns an axles plant.
Responding to a Dutch press report, a spokesman said he could not rule out
that Daf officials had mentioned a higher figure than Fl 100m in their loan
talks with the Dutch government, but he added that no written request for
additional loans had been submitted.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: SSAB in loss after 8 months

<TEXT>
SSAB, the Swedish steel company recently privatised by the Swedish
government, suffered a SKr119m (Dollars 22.5m) loss - after financial items
 -in the first eight months of the year, it reported yesterday.
This contrasts with a SKr114m profit for the same period of 1991 and an
SKr87m profit for the first four months of this year.
Operating revenues dropped drastically to SKr7.89bn for the first eight
months, down from SKr9.23bn for the same period of last year.
The company blamed the sharp deterioration on its performance in the second
four months of the year to the outbreak of the fierce European price-cutting
steel war as well as the reduced demand for steel in industry, particularly
in Sweden.
Mr Leif Gustafsson, chief executive, said that 1992 had turned out to be a
tougher year for the steel industry than expected. He added that, despite a
rationalisation programme that had slimmed its payroll by 7 per cent, SSAB
would make a small financial loss in 1992 although normally the third
four-month period is better than the other periods of the year.
Mr Gustafsson added that the whole of the European steel industry would
suffer large losses in 1992 but SSAB had shown it was more effective than
others in adapting itself to straitened times.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: S Jerome Pounds 1.2m disposal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
S JEROME &amp; Sons (Holdings), the West Yorkshire-based textiles and
electronics group, is selling CMR, a designer and installer of security,
closed-circuit television and telecommunication systems, to Westinghouse,
the US electronics group, for Pounds 1.2m cash.
The amount may be adjusted to take account of CMR's agreed net tangible
assets. Westinghouse will assume performance guarantees amounting to Pounds
790,330 and will take on responsibility for CMR's bank overdraft up to a
maximum of Pounds 3.3m.
For the year to December 31 CMR incurred a Pounds 330,000 pre-tax loss on
turnover of Pounds 17.2m. Its net asset value at that date was Pounds
654,000.
Proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce Jerome's bank borrowings.
Gearing will fall from 74 per cent to about 40 per cent.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work (3): Advance details of the next
issue - The review will look at users' experiences in the areas of computer
aided design and computer aided manufacturing, (CAD/CAM). The 'hot topic'
will be document and image processing / Winter 1992
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECIALIST writers will examine developments in the following areas:
CAD/CAM: Computers have become an essential part, if not the main tool, in
the designer's toolkit.
The earliest computer aided design systems demonstrated the benefits of
being able to view a design in 3D before it was built. Such models are now
an integrated part of the manufacturing process.
Software At Work seeks sites which have linked their CAD systems to other
elements in the manufacturing cycle, for spin-off benefits in production,
documentation, and quality control.
Online Database: This has become an essential reference tool for those who
need instant, accurate information. The problem is usually not a lack of
information, but too much of it, so software for text retrieval and
selective searches has to work hand-in-hand with the database. Software At
Work seeks users who have integrated external online databases with their
in-house systems.
Hot topic: document and image processing: desktop publishing technology is
now used enthusiastically by many companies outside the province of
typesetting and publishing.
Now document and image processing are following in becoming affordable
technology for any organisation with the problem of archiving paperwork.
Looking further ahead, topics will include:
In the March 1993 issue:
Project management systems.
Electronic data interchange, (EDI).
Rapid development systems, (Unix and mid-range systems).
In the June 1993 issue:
Desktop publishing.
Facilities management.
Electronic funds transfer and point of sale systems.
In the September 1993 issue:
City and dealing room systems.
Geographical information systems, (GIS).
In the December 1993 issue:
Integrated accounting systems.
Disaster recovery (software/data).

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work (1): Users want information, not
just systems
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are three main topics in this issue of Software at Work, the sixth in
the FT's series of quarterly software reviews.
Europeanisation: the hot topic, deals with issues facing both user companies
and software suppliers in catering for a Europe without trade barriers, but
with the considerations of language, currency and cultural differences.
Human resources: information systems evolved from the first preserve of data
processing, payroll and personnel systems.
Database marketing: the use of database techniques to find out more about
customers and address them more cost-effectively by telecanvassing or direct
mail.
As always, Software at Work gives users the chance to explain how they
implemented software products to solve business problems. The point of our
research among users is not to find 'the best product.' Generally there is
no such thing in the area of software products.
However, there is usually a 'best fit', and a right way of going about the
choice of a solution and its implementation.
Our selection of case studies is designed to illustrate the process of
choosing software. The aim is to highlight issues in both management and
technology, passing on the benefit of experience to readers about to embark
on the same journey. The stories are presented either as case studies (a
minimum of one per product) or as site visits. The case studies generally
carry associated details on the product and supplier, with 'pros and cons'
contributed by interviewees who chose (or rejected) that particular
solution.
The site visits provide an opportunity to examine in more detail some
strategies for information technology (IT) in these areas. Alongside the
story, site reports carry a snapshot on the subject company, plus a system
profile of the technology and services in use. The consultant's critique
highlights the lessons to be learnt from the site, assessing the
effectiveness of the chosen solution.
To check that today's success story is not tomorrow's disaster, we
occasionally return to chosen sites to update the story.
A list of buzzword definitions is included to help those readers who grapple
with the obscure terms and acronymns adopted by IT experts.
The next issue: telling more tales
In the next issue we will be seeking user stories in the areas of CAD-CAM,
(computer aided design and manufacturing) and online database services.
If you are a user with a tale to tell of how such a system has benefitted
your company, we would be delighted to hear from you direct.
Vendors of software and services wishing to contribute should note that
pre-warned user contacts are a pre-requisite. Both user details and supplier
details must be submitted in a particular format.
To be sent the relevant forms, suppliers wishing to contribute should
contact the Financial Times Surveys Department - in writing only, please -
stating which topic is of interest.
User details are requested by October 16 to allow time for telephone
interviews.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Italy in talks on stand-by loan to boost the lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday said it had begun discussions with its EC
partners on a stand-by loan to boost the lira and sustain confidence in
plans for an early return to the European Monetary System.
The surprise move was announced along with Italy's 1993 budget which was
approved yesterday by the cabinet and promises to reform the country's
deteriorating public finances.
The government also announced a plan to create a special fund, using
privatisation receipts and dividends from state owned companies, to help pay
off the state's debts. Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, said the aim
of the EC loan was partly political. At one level, he said Italy wished to
demonstrate its continued commitment to the EMS, but at the same time the
loan appears designed to provide a rigid external framework for Italy's
economic performance. It would make it more difficult for parliament to
water down the budget.
Officials declined to reveal the amount of the loan, but said the move was
different from the UK's decision earlier this month to go to the markets for
an Ecu loan to help protect sterling. It is expected to take up to four or
five weeks to negotiate and would not be drawn down until after the 1993
budget was approved.
There was speculation yesterday that the stand-by facility might not be
fully used if granted, providing the currency markets stabilised and
interest rates began to fall. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said
the facility would be a 'super-certification' by Italy's EC partners of the
country's credibility. The lira was still under pressure yesterday, hovering
around L880 to the D-Mark.
Brussels officials predicted a sympathetic response to the loan request. Mr
Amato is seen as the best hope for tackling the country's budgetary crisis
and restoring international confidence in the economy, but he needs outside
help, an EC official said.
An EC loan would support his efforts to win parliamentary approval for his
economic package, rather than a potentially contentious loan from the
International Monetary Fund. 'We would be keeping the problem within the
family,' the official said.
Brussels expects Mr Amato to seek financial aid under Rule 1969 adopted in
June 1988 allowing the EC to help countries which experience balance of
payments problems or adverse capital movements.
Some Ecu16bn (Dollars 22.4bn) has been set aside for support. Greece is the
only EC member to have applied, securing a Ecu2.2bn stabilisation loan in
February 1991.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK's lack of policy comes under attack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS and financial leaders in the UK warned yesterday that the absence
of a coherent economic policy and Britain's potential isolation from Europe
could damage the country's prospects for economic growth.
As the latest tussle between the German and UK authorities simmered,
industrialists and financiers urged the government to rid the country of
uncertainty by adopting a clear economic strategy. Some said it would take a
new chancellor to implement it.
Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, urged the government
to make a clear commitment to the Maastricht agreement.
One bank chairman, who refused to be named, said: 'I am extremely concerned
at the absence of an economic policy in the UK.'
Mr David Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, the packaging and printing group,
which has extensive activities in mainland Europe, said it was essential for
the government to re-establish order in its management of exchange rate
policy.
'We want order and certainty. In the absence of that we have huge movements
of cash swinging around the world not driven by trade but by people
speculating in money. That volatility is hugely damaging,' he said.
Mr Geoffrey Shingles, the UK head of Digital Equipment, the largest US
minicomputer manufacturer, said he was angered and frustrated by the
government's inability to bring down interest rates to a level which would
help industry.
Arguing that the German position was correct, he said of the UK government:
'They have got themselves in a ridiculous situation. They had the chance to
rebalance the economy and they threw it away'.

FT  02 OCT 92 / US Senate approves IMF quota rise and Israel backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate yesterday finally approved an aid package to provide both the
country's Dollars 12bn quota in the International Monetary Fund's capital
increase and Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees for Israel.
Neither measure would incur a direct cost to the US taxpayer, unless Israel
were to default on its loans or the IMF to got bankrupt, but both have had
rocky passages through Congress.
President George Bush tried to win support for the unpopular IMF quota
increase by attaching it to a package providing aid to Russia and the other
republics of the former Soviet Union, but many of his own Republican party
supporters still baulked at it.
Besides the Israeli loan guarantees and the IMF quota increase, the
appropriations bill approved by the Senate yesterday includes about Dollars
14bn of foreign aid.
Since the US is by far the IMF's largest member, passage of the quota
increase was critical to the implementation of the quota increase, which
would increase the IMF's capital base by 50 per cent to SDR135.2bn (Dollars
198bn).
Without the increase, IMF officials expected their resources to fall to
critical levels by the end of the year.
Washington officials were optimistic that a small appropriation for United
Nations family planning activities, which the Bush administration has used
as grounds for a veto, would be dropped in a final conference to reconcile
the House of Representatives and Senate versions of the bill.
In a separate vote, the Senate ratified the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
by which the US and the former Soviet republics agree to cut their arsenals
of nuclear warheads.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE increasingly assertive Ukrainian parliament last night passed a vote of
no confidence in the country's communist-dominated government.
The decision, opposed by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the president, is being hailed
by opposition leaders as an opportunity to begin economic reforms in
Ukraine.
Parliament's vote by an overwhelming 295 to six came as a postscript to
Wednesday's resignation of Mr Vitold Fokin, the Ukrainian prime minister. Mr
Kravchuk tried to limit the damage by urging parliament to accept Mr Fokin's
resignation but leave his like-minded cabinet in place.
However, parliamentarians defied their president and voted to oust the
entire cabinet. They gave Mr Kravchuk 10 days to select a new prime
minister, and another 10 days to form a new cabinet before presenting it to
parliament for ratification.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Pressure builds for Europol to replace Interpol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN unlikely alliance of US law enforcers, Flemish politicians and police
officials, is pressing for Europol, the proposed EC criminal intelligence
agency, to replace Interpol as a credible international crime-fighting
network.
In Brussels yesterday, Mr Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the US
National Association of Chiefs of Police, and Mr Quinlan Shea, a former
advisor to the US department of justice, said leaks of information on
terrorism and drug trafficking had discredited Interpol. Several top
Interpol officials have been convicted of drug-trafficking over the last
five years.
'They say you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear: well, we need a
silk purse international criminal intelligence agency, and Interpol is
always going to be at least partly pig,' said Mr Shea.
Mr Willy Kuijpers, a member of the Belgian parliament's upper chamber, said
Europol should be subject to democratic control and data protection
principles.
A Strasbourg-based team of EC police officials is in the early stages of
setting up Europol, which is supposed to start work by the beginning of next
year. But there is still much debate among EC member states as to what it
should do.
Participants in yesterday's debate admitted that it was a long way from
becoming a full alternative to Interpol. 'We have hopes for Europol as a
start, mainly because we have no hopes for Interpol,' said Mr Shea.

While mobile phone companies strive to produce ever-lighter handsets, there

Open outcry trading of options, futures and stocks can be brutal for both

<TEXT>
ICI, the UK chemicals group, likes to talk about the synergy between its
research into pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. A specific example of that
is published in today's Lancet, Clive Cookson writes.
NTBC, a compound originally invented as a potential herbicide at the
company's US agrochemicals research centre in California, turns out to be a
valuable drug for treating children with type I tyrosinaemia, an inherited
metabolic disorder.
The link was discovered during safety testing at ICI's central toxicology
laboratory in the UK. This showed that NTBC affected the metabolism of the
amino acid tyrosine.
A collaborative clinical study with Gothenburg University in Sweden has
confirmed that NTBC can prevent the build-up of toxic metabolic by-products
in tyrosinaemia. About one child in 100,000 is born with the disease - and
most die before they reach adolescence. ICI Central Toxicology Lab: UK, 0625

The wellington boot, forever linked in the public mind with the quilted
jacket to give that essential bucolic look, is about to leave its footprint
on the agricultural industry.
Clares Dickies, an Avon-based workwear manufacturer and supplier, has
launched its Landmaster agricultural safety wellington boot range - claimed
to be the world's first 100 per cent polyurethane welly.
The boot, made from a unique polyurethane compound, is produced by
Vredestein, a leading European safety footwear supplier. It lasts twice as
long as ordinary PVC or rubber boots, but because of its lightness - 1,000g
lighter than rubber - it is easier to wear.
The boot is resistant to oil, animal blood, grease, acid and most chemicals.
There is even an ultra-safety version with steel toecaps - ideal, perhaps,
for dealing with errant ramblers and other farm pests. Coloured green, with
brown soles - they cost about Pounds 22 per pair. Clares Dickies: UK, 0761

FT  02 OCT 92 / People: Henderson moves Buckley to pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Henderson Administration, the big fund manager which has lost a lot of
pension fund clients over the past couple of years, has put Ian Buckley, its
new investment chief, in charge of its pension fund business.
Buckley, 43, who joined Henderson in May from Sun Life Asset Management, has
been appointed managing director of Henderson Pension Fund Management
(HPFM), which accounts for a third of the group's funds under management. He
replaces Robin Hindle Fisher, 33, who has been doing the job since 1990 and
is leaving to become an assistant director of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Management.
The poor performance of Henderson's pension fund business, which resulted in
the client defections, pre-dated Hindle Fisher's appointment; Colin Day,
chairman of HPFM, says Hindle Fisher has done a 'terrific job' and he was
'sad to lose him'.
Client losses had been stemmed and 'we are beginning to find our way back on
to new business presentations and consultants' lists', says Day. However, he
noted that it took a while for potential clients to be convinced that
Henderson's recent improved performance was not just a 'flash in the pan'.
As a result of the change Buckley will be involved in everything from
investment performance to managing client relationships.

Michael Fallon, a junior education minister in the last government who lost
his Darlington seat in April, has picked up his first non-exec-utive
directorship. He is joining the board of Quality Care Homes, a Darlington
company owning and operating nursing homes that was recently listed on the
stock exchange. He is Quality Care's first non-exec-utive director.
Based mainly in London, Fallon says he is pleased to retain links with his
old constituency, where he still has a house. 'It is also good to be
associated with a business that is expanding. This company has been
particularly successful at putting up purpose-built nursing homes right in
the urban areas they serve.'
Duncan Bannatyne, founder and managing director, aims to have 1,000 beds in
20 homes across the north by the end of 1994.
Fallon, who says he has had a number of approaches since he lost his seat,
stressed that he was 'certainly not seeking an early return to parliament'.
He is pursuing 'a number of business interests' in London, but will not
identify them: 'There are some perks to being a private citizen.'

the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - is revolutionising research in
molecular biology while creating a market that is likely to be worth Dollars
1bn (Pounds 500m) a year by 1996.
Commercialisation of PCR had been delayed by disagreements over the
ownership and rights to license the technology. Now, after several
protracted legal wrangles, it rests securely in the hands of Roche, the
Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group.
PCR is probably the most important development in genetics research since
the discovery of gene-slicing in 1973. It enables geneticists to identify a
particular gene or part of a gene and then make multiple copies at an
exponential rate, so they can obtain enough material for analysis.
Prior to PCR, every time a gene was studied it had to be inserted into
bacteria or other cells - a process called cloning - and then grown in a
culture. Now any gene can be studied without cloning, even if it is present
in quantities that are too small to be detected or analysed directly. Until
now, DNA testing methods have not been sensitive, fast or cheap enough to be
generally useful.
'The potential of PCR boggles the mind,' says Werner Zolg, a Roche PCR
specialist. Applications cover basic research, medical diagnosis,
environmental protection, archaeology and forensic medicine.
It enables scientists to analyse minute traces of genetic material from
diverse sources such as fossilised leaves and frozen mammoths, rape and
murder scenes, and bacteria and viruses. Roche scientists like to describe
PCR as a method by which scientists can 'find a needle in a haystack and
then build a stack of needles'.
Dozens of new experiments using PCR are published in scientific journals
every week. A recent example from Nature is a project to analyse the genetic
diversity and feeding habits of an endangered population of brown bears in
northern Italy by amplifying DNA sequences from their droppings.
But tests to diagnose human diseases are likely to represent the largest
market.
PCR was first made public in 1985 by Cetus, a Californian biotechnology
company. One of its researchers, Kary Mullis, came up with the idea of
exponentially increasing gene pieces. After making sure it worked, he had to
persuade Cetus the project was worth pursuing.
The technique is based on natural enzymes which cut and amplify the genetic
chemical DNA. Initial attempts used an enzyme which broke down when heated.
Since heating is an essential part of the PCR process, more enzyme had to be
added at the end of each of the 30 or so cycles - a labour-intensive
process. Cetus researchers solved the problem by isolating a heat-stable
version of the enzyme from a microbe which thrives in hot water springs.
This was an important advance because it allowed the technique to be
automated.
Cetus then acquired a partner, the US scientific instrument maker Perkin
Elmer, which took responsibility for producing and marketing an automated
PCR machine. It also entered into an agreement with Eastman Kodak to develop
diagnostic systems.
In 1989 Cetus ended this association with Eastman Kodak in favour of another
with Roche, permitting Roche to administer licences for diagnostic uses of
PCR and to prosecute those using the technique without a Perkin Elmer
machine. Eastman Kodak claimed exclusive rights over certain applications
and was worried that a deal with Roche might lead to a conflict of
interests. Negotiations between the two did not lead to an amicable
agreement.
Roche then refused to grant the US chemical group Du Pont a licence to
supply PCR-based diagnostic kits and equipment. In an attempt to break the
monopoly held by Cetus and Roche, Du Pont alleged that Cetus's claim to the
PCR patent was void. It took until March 1991 for Cetus to show that its
patents were valid. The Eastman Kodak dispute was also resolved that year.
Roche eventually paid Cetus Dollars 300m for exclusive rights to its PCR
technology with the possibility of a further Dollars 30m in royalties. Cetus
then merged with Chiron.
Under the agreement, Cetus sold back its 49 per cent holding in Perkin
Elmer, which formed a strategic partnership with Roche and gained rights to
develop systems for non-diagnostic applications. Roche now effectively owns
the entire PCR market.
Since acquiring the full rights to the technology, Roche has liberalised the
draconian licensing regime that had been instituted during the company's
acquisition of Cetus - after some discussion with the scientific community
in the US.
The new worldwide policy 'will provide all laboratories offering human
in-vitro diagnostic testing with the freedom to use PCR for all human
diagnostic testing services', said Agnieszka Junosza-Jankowski, PCR
licensing manager at Roche headquarters in Basle.
'If the licensee makes any improvements or inventions related to PCR, the
licensee has the option to license back these improvements to Roche.' The
royalties payable range from 9 to 18 per cent, depending on the type of
testing service offered.
Outside the field of diagnostic testing, the position is not so clear-cut.
Roche says licences for environmental, food testing, research, forensic and
industrial applications will be handled in the context of the strategic
alliance with Perkin-Elmer.
The strong demand for PCR is inevitably causing delays, as Roche's licensing
department negotiates with dozens of would-be commercial users.
Junosza-Jankowski says the company has already signed agreements with
providers of diagnostic testing services in the US, Japan, Australia,
Switzerland and Spain.
Roche has not yet signed any licensing agreements in the UK. But an
agreement with Cellmark Diagnostics, ICI's genetic testing subsidiary, is
expected shortly.
For most users who want to amplify small amounts of DNA, there is no viable
alternative. Other techniques for copying genes are in development but no
one has come up with anything as simple, wide-ranging and convenient as PCR.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Technology: Herbal sales set to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals giants and consumer products groups are quickly moving into
the herbal remedy market, according to a report* by consultants McAlpine,
Thorpe &amp; Warrier.
The report shows that companies such as Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Sanofi of
France, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck of the US, and Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz of
Switzerland have made acquisitions of herbal medical companies in the last
three years.
The report estimates there are more than 2,000 herbal medical companies in
Europe and more than 220 in the US. Most companies in this highly fragmented
sector do not have sales beyond their national bases. More than 90 per cent
of these companies have a turnover of less than Pounds 5m and the same
percentage is privately owned. The largest company is Proctor &amp; Gamble; its
herbal laxative Metamucil has sales of Pounds 80m a year.
The pharmaceutical groups are attracted by the fast growth of the herbal
medicine market which is expanding more rapidly than the traditional
over-the-counter sector. In the US, UK and Italy it is growing at between 12
per cent and 15 per cent a year by value.
The report argues that greater knowledge of the side-effects and dangers of
modern medicine will drive demand for herbal medical drugs. The increasing
size of the geriatric market in western countries will also be a factor.
The report warns that there is a danger of new regulatory requirements for
herbal products equivalent to those existing for pharmaceuticals. This would
stifle the introduction of new products and diminish the effectiveness of
existing products through the reduction in the number of ingredients they
are allowed to contain.
Germany is the largest market in the world for herbal medicines, with annual
sales of Pounds 1.2bn representing nearly 25 per cent of the national
pharmaceuticals market. About 40 per cent of these sales are sold on
prescription. The US is the next largest with sales of Pounds 480m.
*Competitive positioning: Who's doing what in the herbal medical industry.

FT  02 OCT 92 / People: Arbitrator elected Lord Mayor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Francis McWilliams, an international arbitrator specialising in
construction-related disputes, has been elected 665th Lord Mayor of London.
On November 13 he succeeds Sir Brian Jenkins for a year-long term in the
largely ceremonial post at the helm of the City Corporation.
Previously a civil engineer, McWilliams, 66, lived in Malaysia for 23 years
where he was responsible for the creation of the industrial city of Petaling
Jaya New Town in Selangor. At the age of 50, he returned to the UK to read
for the Bar, and turned immediately to the settlement of disputes.
The City Corporation cites his unconventional background as giving the lie
'to the common assumption that the City of London is a closed club,
uninterested in the introduction of fresh blood and ideas'.
Evidently, though, some clubs are more open than others. As hobbies
McWilliams lists membership of eight golf clubs, and boasts of a long
friendship - 'which involved many games of golf' - with the former Crown
Prince of Malaya.
McWilliams says his theme for the year will be 'the City and industry in
partnership'. 'I would like to see the City 'user friendly'; I hope that, if
there is a lack of understanding of each other's problems, this can be
eliminated.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (47): High speed
customer analysis - How to gather data on 36,000 people in just five seconds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSINESS of MAI Research is data and information. The company interviews
about 70,000 individuals annually on details of personal finance. It
collects, records, collates, and then sells details about bank accounts,
savings and spending habits, writes Claire Gooding.
The technology in which it invested in the last two years has already made a
difference in the service it offers its customers. Every six months, MAI (a
division of NOP Corporate and Financial) publishes 16 core reports based on
the information it culls, which amount to anything between 10,000 and 16,000
pages of information.
'We visit people on a one-to-one basis and ask them about their finances:
building societies, banks, Tessa, stocks and shares,' explains James
McCullagh, associate director. Strangely, people are happy to co-operate,
and a very small proportion baulk at revealing their financial arrangements.
The buyers of the reports are largely banks, building societies and other
financial organisations.
Building societies, banks and insurance companies are all competing for the
same sort of customer, and increasingly need to use the data more creatively
for marketing in general, and profiling and segmentation in particular.
'Traditionally, our business is to collect the data and sell tabulated
reports. Whereas we used to hold the database on a mainframe with some
interactive ability, we were keen to find an online solution.' says
McCullagh.
'With 60 clients, it made sense to provide a software and hardware solution
on the desk.'
On joining the Financial Research Services (FRS) at NOP 18 months ago, he
realised that some drastic changes were needed.
'Everything was done in-house, but if you wanted to modify a particular
table, there was no way of re-arranging the data without going back to the
DP people.'
He has single-handedly researched and pushed through the technology
programme for the company, which since MAI's take over of NOP, has become
MAI Research. Typically, MAI clients wanted to look at the data in all sorts
of different ways, perhaps cross-referencing mortgage holders with
credit-card holders.
'Every client has a different need, so it's important to let them choose how
they look at the data,' he says.
The end-user requirement meant that user friendliness and flexible, simple
commands were a must for McCullagh. MAI looked at M-Tab, a product from
US-based Gamma, and Quanvert, from UK company Quantime - 'there is not a lot
of off-the-shelf analysis software around. We wanted to be in control of the
software and the hardware. Quanvert, we found, actually worked, and was easy
to use.'
It was an extra comfort factor that the developers keep a close eye on the
product, and constantly incorporate new features such as Quantime for
Windows. Although Quanvert is a package, MAI has been able to contribute to
the development process so that monthly upgrades have included more and more
features, some of which have benefited other Quantime clients.
The EPS 433 DX notebook computers which host the software are themselves
easy to use. MAI now has 13 of its 60 clients equipped with notebooks.
In November, a comprehensive system goes live, based on the last two years'
experiments. James McCullagh has already been giving the software a thorough
road test: the unorthodox 'site visit' in this case meant that he was the
one doing the visiting, portable laptop in hand. The last two years' data is
already on the system, and open for analysis and manipulation.
'Now that the data is available interactively, on the desk, clients are
beginning to discover that there are lots of other ways they can use the
data. Instead of six months worth of books sitting on the desk, they have
all the information on one little notebook computer. We want to encourage
them to use the data creatively.'
The Quanvert system supports computer graphics and is surprisingly swift at
delivering the results of fairly complex analyses of large amounts of data.
Nor is it difficult to add in new fields after models have been created. It
takes a remarkable five seconds or so to run through data on nearly 36,000
people, and present an analysis on a specific sector, such as families with
young children where both parents are working.
Such analysis helps the users to formulate strategies, deciding on target
markets. For instance, 87 per cent of Tessa saving plans are sold to people
over 55 years of age: such a well-defined pattern can be used creatively for
marketing.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (46): A valuable
aid for marketing strategies - Retailing trends in nursery equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF you want to know how many babies are 'Pampered,' or are chauffeured on
'Silver Cross' wheels, FSA is the company to ask. It provides a continuous
consumer measurement of nursery equipment and baby carriages, writes Claire
Gooding.
The information is sold to manufacturers and retailers of baby products who
pay anything from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 60,000 a year to track the effects
of advertising and promotions, and help plan their future marketing
strategy, as well as to suppliers in a market worth Pounds 1,000m annually.
FSA wanted to provide a flexible and instant analysis of its data as it is
working in one of the few buoyant markets in the UK, currently benefiting
from an increased birthrate and changing trends in parenthood.
'The market is so complicated that we needed something like Quanvert for
analysis' comments Glenn Flackett, managing director of FSA.
'The problem was one of too much data, too many factors, and the production
of an infinite number of tables.
Most of our clients wanted similar information but slightly different,
putting a personal perspective on it.'
Ease-of-use was the key factor in the choice of a package: 'I'm not a
computer person, I've never even used a PC before, says Mr Flackett.
Nevertheless he had a clear idea of the flexibility he required - 'the key
thing is that it allows the people to ask the questions themselves.'
No other software package gave the flexibility the company sought, and
Quantime was approached to implement and tailor the package to FSA's
specification.
Now the clients can analyse the data and pick their own criteria such as the
baby's weight, age, the shop of purchase, to create their own tables.
'The benefits are that the database is more valuable, and the clients are
getting more out of it. For marketing people, it has become established as
part of the corporate toolbox,' he says.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (43): New ways to
reduce errors - Claire Gooding examines the problem of questionable data
lists Sources of Information
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMON complaint among all the companies interviewed on the subject of
database marketing was that there was too much data, rather than not enough.
Worse, the quality of the data bought in from list brokers is often
questionable.
Dick Booth, managing director of Coggon Computer South is used to giving
advice to the companies who buy in data to run with his Salesnet system.
'We have done checks on imported data, using telesales techniques, and I
would say that about 30 per cent of the target data proves to be
inaccurate,' he says.
Before asking whose fault this might be, it is worth reflecting on the ways
that list brokers and market researchers come by their data.
Sometimes - as with NOP - they simply ask, and people are only too happy to
tell. But often, data derives from forms which people fill in for other
purposes, such as applying for a mortgage, a controlled circulation
magazine, or entering a trade exhibition.
All too often, the varieties of spelling, abbreviation, and titles, in the
name alone, result in multiple records and duplicates.
The stories here are about companies whose main product is data - either the
collection of it, or the refinement and delivery of it, using computer
techniques. It is now possible to buy data on CD-ROM, but a lot of work has
to be done on analys is and presentation.
Ironically, the area which most needs addressing is that of data capture,
still limited by the vagaries of handwriting, and the inevitable errors in
transcribing or punching information.
Here, computer aided interviewing, CATI, may eliminate the most error-prone
part of the loop.
One market research company, Ronin, has developed an even more sophis
ticated tool, ESBIS, the Expert Based System Interviewing Software, which
was recently used in an international survey of IT managers.
The system follows the logic by expanding on certain areas with more
detailed questions if the respondent showed interest. Most people have
become wary of filling in detailed forms: they realise now they might be
inviting unwanted mail offers.
But even if you try to remain anonymous, or, like Ronin's IT managers, feel
'over-surveyed,' then the profiling systems will still find you. You can't
hide from the postman, but you don't have to open the mail.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (44): Hunting for
prime prospects - Customer Profiles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTERISED databases have been the mainstay of Dunn Humby, a marketing
consultancy whose services include strategic and tactical market planning.
Its founders left the CACI consultancy to apply the same techniques to the
commercial sector as CACI has used successfully in the consumer market.
'Mosaic and Acorn are clever, but not enough to analyse businesses,'
comments Edwina Dunn, director of Dunn Humby. The company provides a service
identifying people and companies as prime prospects on a one-off basis. It
does so by creating a customer profile from data provided by the client, and
matching it to wider data sources.
Dunn Humby looked at a number of resources, including BT connections, and
Telephone Data Services, TDS - 'the larger databases tended to have a
limited number of details about a great number of companies. We wanted to
know a lot about a little - we wanted a rich, accurate data-source, so that
we could segment by employees, turnover, size or any other factor.'
Dunn Humby chose Lotus One Source's Private+ product for its depth of
detail, but also uses TDS and selected specialised databases such as
Keystroke Knowledge, for government data.
Dunn Humby takes the data supplied by the customer (usually these are
limited to address, contact details and order history), loads it into the
Oracle system, and matches company records with those within Lotus UK
Private+. The customer data is then combined with additional data from One
Source, such as detailed business description, financial and locational
details.
From this cocktail of data, it builds up a sophisticated profile of existing
customers, which is then used against the Private+ listings to identify
potential customers - 'to sell on different levels, you really need
details,' concludes Ms Dunn. 'The clever thing about the One Source data is
that it lays out the relationships - parent, subsidiary. That is unusual,
but an essential part of what we call 'relationship marketing.' '

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (30): A better way
to raise funds - How an animal charity targets its mailings more closely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RSPCA, Britain's famous animal charity, has been working to protect
animals since 1824. Today, direct mailing is its lifeline: its activities
are funded entirely through donations from the public, which last year
reached Pounds 30m, a remarkable Pounds 10m increase on the previous year,
writes Claire Gooding.
The aim of its marketing database project is to increasing revenue by
producing focused mailings. Like any charity, the RSPCA is concerned with
getting good value for money. Its new marketing database is dedicated to
producing market statistics and tailored membership lists, so that direct
mailing becomes more efficient and cost-effective, the main aim being to
release funds for the animal welfare work.
From the RSPCA headquarters in Horsham, where its fund-raising and
membership activities are based, project manager David Stechler explains the
problems that faced him.
'We had 40 different databases, which we wanted to consolidate into one
source of information for in-house control and reduced cost.'
It was not just a matter of co-ordinating the various sources for the
450,000 names on the RSPCA lists, but also of bringing together three
separate services, the Axciom bureau, which produced the lists, the Brand
Direct direct marketing house, and Mail Marketing, which would analyse and
deliver response information back to Axciom.
Costs were considerable, as the RSPCA was mailing at least one campaign
monthly, and a major mailing every three months, and paying each time for
the use of the Axciom data. Mr Stechler sent his 'wish list' of features to
26 suppliers of packaged solutions.
These whittled down to a shortlist of six who were able to offer systems for
charities: CMG, the Specialist Computer Group, Donorbase, Minerva,
Systemteam and Care Business Solutions. The plan was to integrate all the
older systems for payroll, library and membership, currently on different
DEC and Data General hardware.
This scheme eliminated the PC-only solutions for the marketing database. The
RSPCA users felt most comfortable with the proposal from Care, essentially a
bespoke system based on the Empress relational database.
'We liked the people, they were local, close, and the users felt that this
product would be theirs rather than anyone else's because it could be
tailored to our requirements so closely. We felt this might give us an edge,
and we wanted an advantage over the competition.'
Now all the core systems, donation, accounts, contacts and membership, are
in one integrated system.
'We've rationalised on one HP 9000 with a PC network for all our
applications,' explains Mr Stechler. 'Our objective was to create a system
where any authorised user could access any application from any terminal.'
The RSPCA refused to reveal how much the entire project cost, but is
convinced of its benefits.
'This system is cheaper to run, and it is more effective at getting
donations because we can identify the hierarchy: people who are just
interested, those who have given members, active members. If we know who all
our contacts are, it's easier to convert a one-off contact into an active
member.'
The RSPCA's own data includes details of donations, legacies, covenants and
legacies, responses to mailshots and information from mail order trading
operations. In addition, it buys in 'cold lists' from third parties such as
list broker Dudley Jenkins.
The Care system links with GB Mailing which draws on Royal Mail address
files for postcodes, and is then linked with the Mosaic system for s
ocio-demographic analysis of postcoded addresses.
The next step, now that the system is in place, is to sample the database,
an exercise which will allow the RSPCA to target its mailings more closely,
and achieve its aim of bringing in more funds, spending less on information
technology - and more on rescuing animals in distress.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (50): Big savings
in mailing costs - User view in the financial services sector; GE Capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GE CAPITAL had plenty of systems to help it administer 6m cards in Europe,
but they were all operational - 'we were unable to exploit the wealth of
customer-information we held in them or archives,' explains Laurie Jeffrey,
head of database development. Any ad-hoc enquiries involved DP staff writing
a special report, and files were product-based, rather than focused on the
consumer.
GE Capital is the largest company in Europe managing retailer financial
services, a subsidiary of the US-based GE Corporation which manages 50m
cards in the US.
GE's search for a marketing database product in 1988 drew a blank. Now, says
Mr Jeffrey, Marketpulse as a package would be a serious contender - 'then,
the choice was to do nothing, do a conventional in-house development, or
develop using a relational database, (rdbms).'
Credibility and the proven ability to cope with high volumes were important
considerations - but so were cost, risk of failure, ability to meet
requirements and future positioning. The benefits GE sought were reduction
in mailing costs, and better-targeted mailing, but an important part of this
was putting data into the hands of the user.
A highly detailed rdbms evaluation of IBM's DB2 and Model 204 tested the
volume criterion with a 50,000-customer database.
GE wanted to use its using its existing IBM mainframe, rather than new
hardware; in benchmarking, Model 204, with which the Marketpulse mainframe
version works, showed a distinct advantage for the marketing applications.
Impressed with the technical ability of CCA (Marketpulse's parent), GE
Capital chose the team which later turned its software into the Marketpulse
package. The original GE database was derived from in-house records and now
updates make use of the card system, with some use of an external credit
bureau.
GE relied on CCA heavily for technical assistance and training, and also had
its sizing predictions confirmed by an outside consultancy. Mr Jeffrey
reports a considerable saving in mailing costs, and says that further
savings are available for additional marketing to the best customers, who
are now easily identifiable.
'We are beginning to exploit other business opportunities, particularly
where the database compliments our operational systems,' he says. The
system, named the Consumer Database, now holds over 200m million records
with details of purchases by 6m customers.
Mr Jeffrey has some valuable advice for others taking the same path: 'Our
experience is that marketing and systems people can work together. Avoid the
traditional development process and keep the two parties and the supplier
involved throughout. Base the justification and proposal on real business
issues rather than technical ones, and prioritise delivery according to
scale of benefits availa ble.
'Remember that it is a specialised business area that is unsuitable to many
generalised database products: avoid existing solutions looking for
problems.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (49): Flexibility
is crucial - Few software packages perfectly match the requirements. True
adaptability can be provided by supplying tools that the purchasers can use
 -The right software tools for the job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL

   A BAD workman blames his tools, so the saying goes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but many software packages never make the tools available in the first
place. Most professional software designers build their systems from simple
re-useable components. This enables them to change the package quickly if
market conditions dictate. However, few if any of these tools are ever made
available to the purchaser. This allows the developer to retain control of
the software.
For example, a large number of specialist packages are built around
databases. The personnel management systems discussed elsewhere in this
issue all have a database package at the core. Often this is a standard
database, such as Oracle. Surprisingly few of the vendors highlight the
advantages that this brings the system purchaser. A modern database package
allows very complex, specific reports and analyses to be produced in
minutes.
The system at the Children's Society, (see case study: page 15) has
'soundex' searches in the Oracle layer. This means that a search for the
name 'Thompson' will also match 'Thomson,' 'Thomason' and so on. It can go
further and find 'Thomas' and even 'Timson,' for example. However, the
system vendor has not brought this facility out to the surface and the
soundex searches are not available to the users. Happily, this can be
corrected by the systems staff adding a custom Oracle module themselves.
It is this sort of flexibility that can make a big difference to how a
company uses a software product. A large number of packages become
'shelfware' (ie they are bought - but never leave - the buyer's shelf)
because they cannot perform a particular function.
Although the rest of the package may be acceptable, this one lack may
condemn it. For the vendor, it has the implications of little repeat
business, even if they have sold the first copy.
Increasingly, vendors are realising the importance of customisation and
specials but the economics of software development make it prohibitively
expensive. It is not viable to spend three days (at, say, Pounds 500 per
day) customising a Pounds 100 package. However, it is possible for the user
to tackle this instead, if the correct tools are provided.
It is the users who understand their daily operations. They are the ones
with experience. They alone understand the particular inter-relationships of
their data. It differs for every company according to the culture and
traditions of the management.
While one managing director manages for cash, another looks for growth and
yet another values market share. No one standard report can encapsulate the
needs of all.
There a number of common features between each: all will need totals and
averages at some point. They will also need a set of date calculations for
things like estimating current age from date of birth or length of service
from date of joining.
What the vendors have to do is to provide these basic tools in much the same
way as calculator manufacturers provided buttons for the four common
arithmetic operations.
Increasingly, computer software vendors are using metaphors to try and
de-mystify operations. Modern spreadsheets such as Excel mimic the
traditional accountant's sheet and then add tools like 'summing' a column of
figures on a single button.
The entire GUI movement has been based on emulating a desktop on a screen.
Thus, programs overlap on the screen and whatever you are working on floats
to the top. Unfortunately, this metaphor has gone too far and many people's
screens are as jumbled as their desks.
Increasingly, non-computer people are becoming transformed subtly into
complex programmers. City dealers build complex financial models for
arbitrage calculations, little realising that they are programming.
The downside is that they do not apply the disciplines that are beaten into
the professional programmer - structure, layout and testing. Thus, many
systems are impenetrable to an outsider. Many companies attest to the
problems when the one person who developed it all leaves.
This is balanced by the use of computers as an enabling technology. Queries
and studies can be made that could never have been tackled before. KLM, the
Dutch Airline, uses a complex rostering system which saves hundreds of
thousands of pounds, (see case study: pages 8-9). It could never have been
considered with a manual system. Its sickness recording system has also
allowed them to decrease sick days and to highlight areas where healthcare
training (such as techniques in lifting to reduce back injuries) was needed.
If more data is made readily available, managers can answer more complex
strategic questions. Indeed, the next problem will be selecting the relevant
information from 'info-glut.'
Tools are an important part of software packages to enable managers to
perform their jobs more effectively. Used properly, they can cut, shape and
polish information to produce a beautiful conclusion.

<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government yesterday announced its decision to offer 43 oil and
gas fields to private companies for development as part of its privatisation
programme.
The offer to privatise 12 medium-sized and 31 small oilfields is part of the
government's policy to involve private investment, particularly direct
foreign investment, in the hydrocarbon sector, to supplement the inadequate
resources of the government-owned Oil and Natural Gas Commission and Oil
India.
Foreign oil exploration companies would get income tax relief and would be
levied 50 per cent income tax without surcharge, as opposed to 65 per cent
in other lines of business.
The package offers discovered oil and gas fields for development and areas
for exploration on a continuous basis, as well as incentives to private
companies to participate in joint ventures for the setting up of new
refineries.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Raising jute from the ashes of
the sackcloth industry - Efforts to revive demand in the face of fierce
competition from synthetic materials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUNDEE IN Scotland earned the sobriquet Jute City in the 19th century for
its pre-eminence in processing the material. However, it is to Manchester in
England that the International Jute Organisation has turned in a bid to
revitalise the industry.
The British Textile Technology Group, a research-based company, has just
completed the first part of a Dollars 200,000 programme to find new markets
for jute, which has most commonly been woven into sacking. Jute has been
steadily losing its traditional markets to synthetic materials such as
polypropylene for years. Since 1965 total world imports of jute have fallen
from 1.4m tonnes to less than 950,000 tonnes.
But the crop, which needs lots of water, remains important to the five
countries which produce it - India, Nepal, China, Thailand and particularly
Bangladesh, which accounts for 55 per cent of world exports. The
Bangladeshis rely on jute for 10 per cent of jobs and the crop accounts for
7 per cent of GDP. In addition the stems account for 70 per cent of the fuel
used by peasant families.
The conventional textile route for processing jute uses carding and spinning
to reach a spun yarn. But this is a crude process for jute, which has fibres
up to two metres long and produces a yarn of great inconsistency in
thickness and strength.
BTTG decided to look instead at non-woven fibres. The classic example is
felt, made from cross-layered wool which is then consolidated into fabric.
The non-woven fabrics market is large and growing at a time when the textile
market in general has been in recession.
Mr Alfred King, executive director of BTTG, points out that the processing
for non-wovens is a very cheap way of transforming fibre into fabric.
Developments in processing have brought new markets into being, such as
disposable nappies and medical goods.
BTTG has been able to create several jute-based non-woven fabrics of
different strengths by chopping the jute fibre into 5-centimetre lengths and
combining it with at least 15 per cent and up to 30 per cent of man-made
fibres. One method involves passing the layered raw material through heated
rollers; the man-made fibre melts and reforms as it cools, binding the
fabric together.
Another, cheaper method is stitch-bonding, where lines of stitching are run
both across and along a layered mat of fibre.
Tests have shown that the resulting materials are unsuitable for disposable
nappies and medical goods as it is both uncomfortable and expensive to
bleach. But Mr King believes there are many other markets for the jute-based
products, which can easily be coated and impregnated.
Among others, BTTG has identified the markets for filtration systems, fabric
stiffeners (eg in luggage), agriculture and horticulture, and automotive
trimming, where jute based products are ideal for deadening sound.
Mr King's team is looking again at traditional markets for jute, such as
upholstery, floor covering, and secondary carpet backing. BTTG is also
proposing jute material for civil engineering projects, for example as
temporary strengthening for earth embankments. 'You don't have to recover it
 -it's absorbed by the soil,' says Mr King.
BTTG now has funding from the UN Common Fund for Commodities and the
Japanese government to continue its research to the end of September next
year. 'We are now refining the processing and looking to have the materials
tried out as products,' says Mr King. He is hoping that the technologies
involved will be passed on to the jute producing countries. 'Ultimately we
hope they will produce these materials themselves rather than exporting just
the fibre.'

COPPER was again depressed on the LME by dull fundamentals and rising
inventories. Comex stocks are at five-year highs while the LME stockpile is
at its highest since April. Talk of Chinese selling and liquidation also
weighed on prices. Three-month copper breached support at Dollars 2,340 a
tonne and eventually ended at Dollars 2,325, down Dollars 25. The next
downside target is Dollars 2,320, dealers said. ZINC was supported by
renewed technical tightness for November metal, with widening premiums
helping to arrest an early decline. The premium for cash over three-month
metal ended at around Dollars 25, compared with Dollars 12 on Wednesday and
last week's small discount. ALUMINIUM continued this week's decline, but
closed above the day's lows, with support for three-month metal developing
at Dollars 1,260 a tonne. GOLD recovered earlier losses to close steady on
the London bullion market. But activity was generally subdued ahead of
today's key US jobs data, which might trigger a cut in US rates. PALLADIUM
extended its rally, fixing at Dollars 97.25 a troy ounce. It has advanced
Dollars 6 in the past week to its highest in over a year on tight supply of
Russian spot metal.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recycled aluminium contract
looks like a winner - The launch next week of the London Metal Exchange's
latest trading product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS ARE already making money from the London Metal Exchange's new
secondary (or recycled) aluminium alloy contract even though it will not be
launched officially until next Tuesday.
'Interest is very high. We have traded many thousands of tonnes,' says Mr
Hans Murmann, joint managing director of Metallgesellschaft's London
subsidiary. 'It seems the contract is coming at the right time. Secondary
aluminium smelters are losing money because of the poor state of the economy
and they are pleased to let the LME have metal for ready cash.'
Smelters were always expected to be the new contract's best hope of success.
They buy scrap metal and have to pay for it by the end of the month. They
sell their aluminium alloy (which contains some copper or zinc) to consumers
who should pay within 60 days but in present economic conditions frequently
keep suppliers waiting for 90 days.
The new LME contract enables the smelters to hedge against movements in both
aluminium scrap and secondary aluminium alloy prices. They can lock in firm
future prices for both.
Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, suggests that this is one
of the new contract's main attractions. The LME's primary aluminium contract
cannot meet this need because primary and secondary aluminium prices
sometimes move in opposite directions, making hedging of secondary metal on
the primary market impossible.
Until now, because there was no way of securing forward prices for scrap
sales, merchants tended to release aluminium scrap when prices were high and
hoard it when prices were low. 'This creates an apparent boom-bust-boom
cycle in scrap supply which is actually driven not by the availability of
scrap but by spot prices,' Mr Abbott suggests.
The fact that several companies have been unofficially trading the new
contract well before the launch date is not the only indication that the LME
might have a winner on its hands. Already 47 alloy brands have been
registered by producers, between them accounting for about 2m tonnes of
material.
The brands are based on three grades that represent the basic - or in the
words of one trader, the 'bog standard' - diecasting alloy specifications in
Japan, Europe and the US, the three main consuming regions. Although the
three chosen grades vary slightly, they are designed for the same function -
automotive diecasting - and consequently in practice there is little
difference in their prices.
All this is a far cry from the situation when the LME launched its primary
aluminium and nickel contracts in 1978 and 1979 respectively. Then there was
fierce opposition because alternative pricing systems were in place and the
industries were nervous about speculators and financial institutions
possibly disrupting the market.
It took years for aluminium and nickel producers who opposed the contracts
to be won over. They certainly did not offer their brands for registration.
The LME simply gave its approval to suitable brands even though they were
not offered.
But the launch of the secondary aluminium alloy contract has not been all
plain sailing. 'It would be wrong to say that the launch of the new contract
was accepted with enthusiasm in all circles,' Mr Abbott admits. 'However,
the general tone of response from the industry has been constructive.'
There were times when the opposition was openly hostile. One US alloy
producer said: 'It will open the market up to speculators and gamblers which
is not in our best interests. It's just a move by the LME to try to sell
more products and there is no real industry need and very limited support
for it'.
The Organisation of European Aluminium Smelters and the Japan Aluminium
Alloy Refiners Association formally condemned the idea on several occasions.
Yet individual members of these organisations are now flocking to have their
brands registered for trading on the new LME market.
That is understandable, according to Mr Hajime Myoi, director of the Japan
Metal Centre in London. 'It's as if someone wants to build a pub next to
your house. You fight hard to prevent the pub being built, but when it has
been built you become a regular customer.'
The LME has already authorised 12 warehouses to store the secondary
aluminium alloy in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the
US.
It is listing only warehouses that have available, where necessary,
temperature and humidity control equipment, which can be used to reduce the
onset of oxidation of the metal.
This continues to be a contentious issue. Some suggest the alloy oxidises in
a few days. Others insist it is not a problem. Metallgesellschaft's Mr
Murmann says, for example: 'I saw some 226 which, for a good reason, had
been in a warehouse in Germany for six years and it was like new.'
Mr Abbott at the LME points out that the same aluminium alloy that is
accepted by the LME is used for such things as car engine blocks. He says:
'These blocks seem to last for the whole life of a car without any
particular protection,' he says.
However, there is a problem because an alloy ingot that has an oxide layer
may contain moisture in the oxide and this moisture would cause an explosion
if it was introduced to the remelt furnace at a diecaster's plant. He adds:
'The problem, is not one of quality but of handling. The diecaster taking
delivery of ingot with oxidation will have to dry the material prior to
melting. This is usually done by stacking the ingot next to the furnace
before melting.'
Mr Abbott says there were three important criteria which were used to
determine whether the new contract was needed:
There had to be good liquidity, a small-volume commodity could not be
considered.
The market had to have the support of participants - both producers and
consumers.
There had to be a need in the market for a representative price and the
industry had to be exposed to risk, have the need to control the risk and
therefore a need for hedging.
The LME insists that all its contracts must be deliverable - in other words
it must be assumed that physical metal will be delivered - and the secondary
aluminium contract is no different. However, the new contract meets the
volume criterion because, as Mr Abbott points out, there is about 4m tonnes
of scrap required to make about 4.5m tonnes of alloy. That compares with
about 7m tonnes of scrap and primary copper that underpins the LME's
'flagship' copper contract.
Mr Abbott expects the new contract to be used by the automotive industry as
well as smelters. Diecasters, who buy aluminium ingot from the smelters and
turn it into components for the car industry, are less likely to be users.
They tend to be small companies and the contract calls for deals to be done
in substantial (20-tonne) lots.
Some traders suggest the new contract will have a profound impact on
secondary aluminium alloy prices and the way aluminium castings are priced.
They suggest that the Japanese and German secondary aluminium producers are
hostile to the contract because it threatens the price cartels alleged to
exist in those countries.
The Japan Aluminium Alloy Association sees things differently and explains
that, unlike secondary smelters in the UK and elsewhere, Japanese producers
have customers lined up for all their production on a long-term basis. None
of it gets to the free market.
In the UK, diecasters are said routinely to buy metal at a Pounds 150 a
tonne discount to the price quoted in Metal Bulletin magazine, which is used
industry-wide, but then to charge the full MB price to their automotive
industry customers.
Mr Ken Lee, secretary of the UK Light Metal Founders Association, points out
that the LME price will be for an LME-deliverable material in an LME
warehouse, a material which is not of British but of German standard and is
for one type of alloy for one type of process. However, a whole range of
alloys is used in the UK and a whole range of processes; and the more
special the metal required, the bigger the premium which has to be paid. 'So
the LME price will only be a marker.'
Nevertheless, Mr David Harris, secretary-general of the UK Aluminium
Federation, suggests: 'This is a major watershed for the pricing of
aluminium ingot and castings. And if it makes aluminium castings more
competitive with other materials, it is to the industry's advantage'.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices up after pact
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COFFEE prices rose yesterday following marathon talks on a new
International Coffee Agreement, which ran through the night to end at 7 am
yesterday.
Delegates to the International Coffee Organisation appear to have succeeded
in wiping out the bitter aftertaste of their last meeting in July. Progress
towards a new coffee pact has been exceedingly slow, but enough has been
achieved in the past 10 days to reassure the markets, analysts believe.
Producers and consumers have agreed a definition of the universal quota,
which will be the foundation of a future pact using export quotas to support
prices. But they failed to reach definitive agreement on controlling the
quota system or on selectivity - under which consumers would be able to
choose the type of coffees they wanted to import. The two sides were able to
agree only on the broad principles.
In London yesterday the November robusta contract rose Dollars 16 to Dollars
794 a tonne, and in late trading in New York the December arabica contract
was 1.15 cents up at 56.85 cents a lb. One London trader said yesterday the
more positive close to the ICO talks had helped market sentiment, 'but
whether there will be a new agreement I still have grave doubts'.
Ms Judith Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said great strides
were not made by the ICO, but it had accomplished something. 'At least they
didn't strangle each other like they did in July.'
The markets are also responding to the firmness of the internal coffee
market in Brazil, which could herald a downturn in exports, and there is
talk of an attempt by a large trade house to spark technical buying and
short covering.
The ICO will meet again from November 23 to December 1, and it has left open
the possibility for a further meeting from December 9. Delegates now have a
chance of agreeing a new pact by the end of the year. But they have yet to
broach the potentially divisive subjects of price levels and market share.

UNIONS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine yesterday signed a wage
agreement granting an increase of nearly 30 per cent from the beginning of
next month.
The deal, which follows of a five-week strike in the summer, grants the
unions most of their demands. The stoppage was suspended in August to give
the authorities time to modify wage control legislation and wage controls
have now been eased for exporters.
Mr Andrzej Machalski, a member of the KGHM board, said yesterday that the
combine, which employs nearly 40,000 people, could not be modernised without
foreign capital. He added, however, that talks with foreign investors could
not start until next year, when the combine will have been restructured.
Mr Machalski confirmed that the Western Mining Corporation of Australia had
offered to invest USDollars 500m in the enterprise. Asarco, the US metals
producer has also offered to manage the company for three years before
making a capital investment offer.

MANAGING long sales cycles is a difficult enough task. When many staff from
both buyer and seller are involved, it is almost impossible without a
suitable computer system, writes David Tebbutt.
Intera Information Technology uses Market-Base to help it sell its
consultancy services, exploration studies and related products to oil
companies, governments and banks involved in funding oil exploration
activities.
Staff in oil companies, banks and governments tend to belong to different
sectors, yet each might be involved in a different aspect of the same sale.
Team leaders, too, might be responsible for multiple contracts and multiple
individuals could have responsibilities within multiple projects.
A system was needed that could accurately reflect this diversity. The
company's existing system, Telemagic, was good but it did not properly meet
the need for a hierarchical, multiple contact, lead management system.
Kensington Marketing Systems, the publisher of Market-Base, is a small
London-based company which proved itself willing to listen and respond to
Intera's needs. The two companies worked closely together to perfect the
system.
The Intera database has been built over the years from contacts in past
projects, from attendance at shows and other promotions. It currently stands
at 1,100 people from 468 companies, all over the world. Mailings are
sometimes sent to multiple contacts within an organisation.
At other times the mailshots would be sent to specialists in certain fields
within the industry.
The addresses are pass ed to Microsoft's Word for Windows for creation of
the word-processed letters. Intera's Malachy Mulhall says of Market-Base:
'It's easy to use and easy to remember. You can immediately see its logic
and it finds information quickly.'
He advises companies to be very clear about their requirements before
looking for a system - 'be aware that a lot of sales people will try and
hoodwink you. If what you want is not on offer, keep looking.'
The cost of Intera's notebook version, plus a four-user version of
Market-Base, was Pounds 4,800, a price which included training and advice.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT, the French carmaker which also includes Citroen, managed a 2.2 per
cent rise in net profits in the first six months of this year and warned
that the outlook for the rest of 1992 was gloomy.
Net earnings rose to FFr2.32bn (Dollars 461m) from FFr2.27bn in the first
half, on sales up by 3.7 per cent to FFr82.6bn. Sales were stagnant in
France, fell in Germany and Britain, but rose strongly in Spain and Italy.
As a result, Peugeot's export sales rose by 11 per cent to FFr50bn, on which
it increased its share of a slightly shrinking western European market from
11.2 per cent to 11.9 per cent. Registrations of Peugeot cars in western
Europe rose by 5.3 per cent to 874,000 units.
Cash flow rose by 9.5 per cent over the period, to FFr7.83bn, while group
debt rose to FFr10.27bn from FFr9,39bn, due to an increase in working
capital requirements and a rise in depreciation charges on the heavy
internal investments of recent years.
Peugeot said it was cautious on the outlook for the rest of the year. It saw
no sign of recovery in France or Britain, while the slowdown in German
consumer demand was gathering pace. Demand in the formerly buoyant Spanish
and Italian markets had braked sharply, due to their government's economic
austerity measures.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: City leaders bemoan the lack of a
clear government policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS and financial leaders in the UK warned yesterday that the absence
of a coherent economic policy and Britain's potential isolation from Europe
could damage the country's prospects for economic growth.
They urged the government to rid the country of uncertainty by adopting a
clear economic strategy. Some said that it would take a new chancellor to
implement it.
Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, called for a clear
commitment to Maastricht.
Mr David Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, the packaging and printing group,
which has extensive European activities, said it was essential for the
government to re-establish order in its management of exchange rate policy.
'In the absence of that we have huge movements of cash swinging around the
world not driven by trade but by people speculating in money. That
volatility is hugely damaging,' he said.
Mr Geoffrey Shingles, the UK head of Digital Equipment, the largest US
minicomputer manufacturer, said
of the UK government: 'They have got themselves in a ridiculous situation.
They had the chance to rebalance the economy and they threw it away.'
Mr Ken Schofield, chief executive of chemicals group MTM, said: 'The new row
between the German and British authorities is the final nail in Mr Lamont's
coffin. We need a new face who can make some difficult decisions.'
Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, also thought Mr Lamont had
to go 'if the government is to come up with a clear-cut statement on
economic policy'.
Fear was expressed, too, that foreign companies could become nervous about
investing in a country whose position and influence in Europe was
questionable.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Bank of France spent FFr80bn to
back franc - Paris report shows extent of action to weather the European
currency crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIRMATION that the French central bank spent around FFr80bn (Pounds
9.4bn) in defending the franc during the currency crisis emerged yesterday
in the Bank of France's weekly report.
The report reveals that the bank's net external position fell by nearly
FFr83.4bn in the seven days to September 24, last Thursday. Around 95 per
cent of this will have been spent in intervening to support the currency,
said economic analysts.
The figure also includes other transactions on the official account, not all
of which are split out in the weekly report, so it is not possible to come
to an exact figure for intervention.
However, it does indicate that the Bank of France has very little left from
its currency reserves, which stood at FFr97.7bn at the end of August. The
Bank of France had no comment yesterday.
The report also reveals that the bank's holdings of short-term paper rose by
FFr70.5bn over the period, representing the amount it has lent to French
commercial banks, seeking a cheaper source of funds than the overnight money
markets.
Rates for call money have climbed steeply since the French central bank
started to intervene, to more than 25 per cent earlier this week.
However, they began to ease yesterday towards 15 per cent as the central
bank injected more liquidity into the markets.
The figure emerges a day after the French government tabled a cautious
budget in an attempt to hold off a new attack against the franc.
It suggests that the central bank might find it harder to intervene to
support the currency if the markets launched another attack on the scale of
last week's currency crisis. Since last week's intervention the franc has
held above its floor against the D-Mark.

JAPAN'S steel exports climbed 13 per cent in August from the corresponding
month a year ago, to total 1.62m metric tons, for the fourth consecutive
month of year-to-year increase, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation reported
yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
But steel exports in August were down 3.6 per cent from July's 1.68m metric
tons. Year-to-year steel exports rose 7.5 per cent in July, 3.1 per cent in
June and 2.6 per cent in May.
The US was the biggest importer of Japanese steel products in August, with
shipments to the country surging 40 per cent from a year ago, to 257,000
metric tons.
A federation spokesman said the unusually high growth was due to a low basis
of comparison the year before because of the lull in the Japanese economy.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Frankfurt leads continental European
markets higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government bond market led most continental European markets
higher yesterday as speculation mounted that the Bundesbank would cut
interest rates at its regular bi-weekly council meeting today.
The benchmark 8 per cent bund maturing July 2002 closed on a yield of 7.41
per cent, down from 7.47 per cent on Wednesday. On Liffe, the December bund
future opened at 90.90 but rose through afternoon trading to reach 91.35 by
the close. Volume was heavy at 90,000 contracts.
The Bundesbank yesterday injected DM15.6bn short-term liquidity into the
money market at a rate of 8.9 per cent, against a Lombard rate - the central
bank's emergency funding rate for financial institutions - of 9.5 per cent.
The operation was taken by some dealers as a sign of easier monetary
conditions ahead. Expectations centred on a  1/4 point cut in the Lombard
rate.
However, more sceptical analysts said money market operations were in the
context of very tight conditions created this week as the authorities
squeezed interbank rates higher. They pointed out that the central bank's
main economic indicators were not pointing to a rate cut.
M3 money supply grew at an annual rate of 9 per cent in August, higher than
8.5 per cent in July and well above a target growth rate of 3.5 per cent to
5.5 per cent. Based on figures from the west German Lander, annual consumer
price inflation is expected to be 3.6 per cent for September.
UK government bonds ended sharply lower at the longer maturities yesterday
as concern about the government's political problems and uncertainty over
the future direction of monetary policy took hold.
The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2008 closed at 97 1/4 , well down from the
opening level of 97 23/32 , for a yield of 9.34 per cent. Shorter dated
stocks performed better, underpinned by hopes of a cut in UK interest rates
if the Bundesbank eases monetary conditions today.
On Liffe, the December gilt future opened at 96.23, rose to 97.10 during
early afternoon but fell back to 96.16 by the close. Trading volume was
light at 30,000 contracts.
The market was unsettled by the weakness of sterling on the foreign exchange
markets. The UK currency stood at around DM2.48 by the close in London, from
DM2.5175 on Wednesday.
ITALIAN government bonds rallied yesterday on increased hopes that the 1993
budget package would be passed by parliament, and an announcement that the
government would ask for approval to borrow in foreign currencies.
On Liffe, the December bond futures contract opened at 91.45 but rose to
92.75. On the cash market, the 12 per cent government bonds maturing May
2002 closed at 92.75 from 91.07 on Wednesday, yielding 13.8 per cent.
Analysts said plans to take on foreign currency liabilities suggested the
authorities were determined to hold the lira at around current levels on the
foreign exchange markets.
SENTIMENT in the French market improved on hopes of a German interest rate
cut, with 10-year government paper yesterday matching the bund rally. The
benchmark 8 1/2 per cent OAT maturing 2002 closed on a yield of 8.61 per
cent, from 8.67 per cent on Wednesday. The yield spread over bunds was
little changed at 124 basis points.
The French Treasury successfully auctioned FFr12.3bn 10-year and 30-year
paper. Bids covered the available stock around two times.
The franc strengthened slightly on the foreign exchange markets, closing
against the D-Mark at FFr3.38. However, money market interest rates remained
high, indicating continued pressure on the French currency. The Bank of
France injected FFr10.7bn short-term funds to the money market, but
overnight money rates remained at 15 per cent.
SPANISH government bonds fell sharply yesterday following the failure of an
auction of government paper but recovered ground with other European markets
in the afternoon.
The authorities declined all bids at the auction of three, five, and 10-year
paper rather than pay higher yields. The auction followed the announcement
that Moody's Investor's Service, the US credit rating agency, would review
Spain's AA2 debt rating.
The 10.3 per cent 10-year government bond opened on a yield of 13.27 per
cent, but fell back to yield 13.58 per cent by early afternoon. However, a
late rally saw bond prices close down only slightly on the opening levels
and the 10-year benchmark finished the day at 13.32 per cent.
US Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday in the wake of more bad news.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 99
7/32 , to yield 7.308 per cent. The two-year note was also markedly firmer,
up  7/32 at 100 19/32 , yielding 3.672 per cent.
The news that sparked the early buying was a 15,000 increase in weekly
claims for state unemployment insurance. The figures raised hopes that the
employment report for September would show a deterioration in the labour
market, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again.
Prices gained ground later in the morning when the National Association of
Purchasing Management index for September showed a decline of 4.7 points to
49.0 and August construction spending a 0.8 per cent drop.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Roche completes record
Dollars 275m equity placement
</HEADLINE>

   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROCHE Holdings, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, yesterday completed the
largest stand-alone equity placement in the US market under the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rule 144A.
The Dollars 275m issue of 10m American depositary receipts (ADRs) was
arranged by Merrill Lynch.
Rule 144a, introduced in 1990, allows companies not registered with the SEC
to place tradable securities with qualified institutional buyers.
Roche is also believed to be the first Swiss company to raise fresh equity
capital in the US market, according to Merrill.
The issue could point to a new trend as Swiss companies become more
concerned about the need to look beyond the traditional confines of their
domestic market.
The 144A offering represents the latest move in Roche's bid to gain a more
international investor base.
Roche is the only Swiss company to have already adopted international
accounting standards, and in July set up a sponsored ADR programme with the
Bank of New York.
With Dollars 8bn in cash, Roche has no immediate requirement for funding,
but is aware of the need to expand its investor base.
Only 3 per cent of Roche's revenues come from Switzerland. The company has
outgrown the Swiss domestic market and wishes to pave the way for potential
funding needs in the future.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Germans pour cold water on
future of Ecu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCEPTICISM about the future of the Ecu market is mounting, as negative
remarks by German officials in recent days wiped out any remaining vestiges
of investor confidence in the sector.
The prospects for further supply, even under the well-established programmes
set up by the Bank of England and the French Treasury, appear to be
dwindling.
Yesterday, Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's four-man
directorate, poured cold water on the future of the currency. Speaking at a
conference in London, he said: 'A future European currency, whatever it is
called, will not be a basket currency.'
For the foreseeable future, the Bundesbank will continue to 'feel
responsible solely for the D-Mark, in the interest of domestic as well as
foreign investors.' Of the Ecu, he added: 'We see no reasons why we should
change our attitude to this artificial currency . . . The current outlook
for the private Ecu market I think is rather gloomy.'
On Wednesday, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, outlined his view
of a two-speed Europe consisting of 'concentric circles', with a nucleus
currency based on the D-Mark which he termed the 'Europamark'.
Although the Bundesbank has long been known for its unfriendly view of the
Ecu, the latest developments, at this crucial stage of debate on the path
towards European monetary union, seem to stamp out hopes of a resurrection.
The Ecu bond market, which went into a steep decline after the Danes'
rejection of the Maastricht treaty on June 2, is now barely traded. Ecu
bonds now yield more than 50 basis points above their theoretical value  -
based on the yields of component currencies.
At this level, banks can asset-swap AA-rated Ecu bonds - from fixed-rate to
floating-rate - at a level of about 20 basis points above the London
interbank offered rate. For such a return, there is demand for the bonds as
floating-rate assets, which is providing some support for the market. But in
the longer term asset-swapping will further reduce the market's liquidity,
since such paper is not likely to be traded.
Meanwhile, the UK and France, both committed to issue under Ecu programmes,
could be forced to abandon or postpone plans for further auctions, according
to some dealers. Financially, such issuance is no longer attractive due to
the sharp rise in Ecu yields.
The French Treasury, which stated at the start of the year that it would
hold an Ecu auction once a quarter, failed to issue during the third
quarter, which ended on Wednesday.
'We are looking for the market to recover somewhat before issuing again,'
said a French Finance Ministry official, adding that he was confident
issuance would resume.
The last Ecu OAT issue, totalling Ecu525m, was in April.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England is due to announce its next Ecu T-Bill tender
next week. The T-bill tender on October 13 is due to be followed by a note
tender on October 20. But some traders suggested that there will not be
sufficient bids. Other dealers said that there should be a stronger bid for
the Ecu short-dated T-bills, since there is still some Ecu cash to invest.
The Bank of England declined to comment on the prospects for the tenders.
In the meantime, dealers see little prospect of any return of investor
interest. 'The Ecu is not going to be the single European currency, and that
seems to be the end of the story,' said one trader.
The failure of the Yes vote in last month's French referendum on Maastricht
to boost the market has destroyed what may have been the market's best
prospect for a revival.
'It's more or less over for the Ecu market,' said one trader yesterday. 'It
was fun while it lasted.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Ireland and Finland replenish foreign
holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND and Finland yesterday turned to the Eurobond markets to borrow in
European currencies, providing the first hints of what could become a wave
of borrowing by European governments after the recent upheaval in currency
markets.
Central banks from Scandinavia to Italy and Ireland have run down their
foreign reserves in defence of their currencies, leaving them under pressure
to replenish their foreign currency holdings.
In addition, heavy intervention by the Bundesbank to support several
currencies within the ERM, among them the lira, sterling and French franc,
has left the countries concerned with an obligation to repay the German
central bank in D-Marks in the near future.
Yesterday's deals are only a drop in the ocean of the total amount of
borrowing that will have to be done. Ireland borrowed DM300m with an issue
that yields 35 basis points over 10-year bunds.
Finland, meanwhile, borrowed Sch1bn for 10 years at a yield of 8.4 per cent.
One banker not involved in the deal calculated that the price would equate
to around 92 basis points over US Treasuries if the deal had been done in
dollars, though another cautioned against seeing this deal as providing an
indication of the level at which Finland would have to borrow in currencies
other than the schilling.

to this aim that Jeg Gray, direct marketing manager, attributes improved
profits to the sharpening up of marketing techniques, writes Claire Gooding.
Not only has it enabled Northern Rock to avoid takeovers and mergers by
staying profitable, but it won the accolade from consultants Philips and
Drew of being 'the most improved building society in 1990.'
As the 11th biggest in Britain, with over a million customers and 1,600
employees, Northern Rock's 124 branches stretch form Inverness to Brighton,
but its main home base is in the north-east. Even here it does not pretend
to be dominant: it vies with the Halifax (17 times larger), each taking a
third of the northern market. This presented Northern Rock with a marketing
dilemma.
'We have to ensure that we are marketing led, with a range of products and
services in line with what customers and potential customers want, and from
which we can make a profit,' explains Jeg Gray.
Additional loans to existing mortgage customers is typical of the 'add-on'
services Northern Rock wanted to sell. But three or four years ago, the
company was well aware that its direct marketing was weak. It had no idea of
the 'lifetime value' of customers.
Senior executives were in on the discussions which led up to the acquisition
of some sort of marketing database, and were unanimous that in-house
resources were better used concentrating on the core business.
'Our own IT staff were busy developing new products such as mortgage and
savings plans, and managing existing systems. We decided to see what the
market had to offer in the way of designing and building a marketing
database,' he says.
Here, the financial soundness, security, and experience were the criteria.
However, in the final decision, Northern Rock chose the solution they now
run from CCN marketing not on the basis of any previous experience with
building societies, but on the willingness of CCN to tailor the service to
its precise needs, and commit considerable resources to the project. Mr Gray
has high praise for the other company on the shortlist, Printronic - 'a good
all-round solution, but CCN Systems' northern location was what finally
swung us.'
As with any marketing database, the main effort was to winnow meaningful
information from the diverse in-house accounting systems.
'It was a matter of re-structuring how we held the data, looking at people,
not accounts. We started with our own internal files, which held nuggets of
information in lots of different places.'
The data is enhanced by using CCN's Mosaic demographic database.
'This divides housing stock into 58 different categories according to
postcode,' explains Jeg Gray. 'Each postcode is relevant to around 17
houses. Mosaic also has census information available to it, so by knowing
the postcode we can find out a lot about our customers and how they conform
to profile.'
Northern Rock was one of CCN's first customers to use its Oasis data
dictionary, a proprietary product for the IBM mainframe which makes the
software adaptable to different account structures, making it possible to
look at account level, person level, or household level.
The software project took four months to complete, using a small team of
business and technical experts in the marketing database field. Now, as well
as selling additional loan products, Northern Rock is able to convince
customers of the benefits of extra security such as insurance. It
cross-sells policies to a wide range of customers, and can demonstrate that
on the savings and investment side, there are several products which have
sold solely through approaches made through the post.
CCN's service includes a monthly production cycle of enhancements and
developments, and although Northern Rock's recent purchase of a Tandem
computer with Oracle database might provide the basis of in-house support,
there are no imminent plans to make the move. On the contrary, Mr Gray
argues forcefully in favour of the bureau approach to marketing database.
'The need for database marketing, or relationship marketing, has never been
more apparent,' he says. 'The best database and strategies are likely to be
provided by people with experience. It is not necessarily an internal IT
function.'
He stresses the value of direct marketing agencies which understand the
power, flexibilities and what he calls 'strategic opportunities' that a
database can provide.
For this, he used WWAV North. Handing over such systems to outsiders is, he
says, no problem, because marketing databases can usually run alongside
accountancy-base systems.
Convincing 'the powers that be' to spend on such assistance and consultancy
could be more of a problem: the organisation has to persuade senior managers
who are used to spending millions of pounds on TV advertising that this is
good value.
Mr Gray is willing to sing the praises of the system, but wary of revealing
too much to the competition because of the edge he believes it has given
Northern Rock in the marketplace.
In the worst housing recession since the Second World War, Northern Rock's
performance outstripped others: profits were up 30 per cent, total assets up
29 per cent, and mortgage lending increased by 45 per cent - thanks to the
effort put into database marketing and direct mail three years ago, he says.
'We are able to reduce marketing costs by communicating with those customers
we consider to be more likely to be interested in the product. This is much
more cost-effective than mailing to the whole file: it's selective
marketing, the difference between junk mail and direct mail.'
So anxious is Mr Gray to promote this desirable difference that he has
become more involved in direct marketing and has taken a place on the
newly-formed board of the Direct Marketing Association.

service to clients - Account relationships are easily reviewed / Bespoke

THE United Bank of Kuwait undertook its database marketing project 'to
enhance relationship-banking.' A British-based consortium employing 275
people, the bank is split into two parts, dealing with investments, and a
Gulf customer-base, 95 per cent of which is Kuwaiti, writes Claire Gooding.
According to marketing officer Michelle Lamb, there was a need for improved
internal marketing information with a view to improving the service to
clients.
'When you're speaking to somebody, it is necessary to know the entire
relationship with that person, which might involve different requirements in
such areas as foreign exchange, fund management, and other departments,' she
says. The previous database, running the Focus fourth generation language
and database, simply could not cope with the organic growth of information.
The bank carried out a full study of mainframe and PC based products,
looking at internal and external resources.
It quickly decided on a bespoke application, and a series of careful
specifications and functional reviews narrowed the field. The information
had to be accessible to computer novices, so ease of use was one criterion.
With 200 private clients and 350 institutional clients, each of which would
relate to an enormous amount of detailed information, speed was another
consideration.
The bank chose the Superbase 4 language for its flexibility, ease-of-use,
and particularly the Windows-based interface. Once it had chosen the
software vehicle, it invited bids from three consultancies, Swift, Database
Management Services, and Softa.
Although its price was not the lowest, Softa won on cost and time-scales,
and worked to implement a Pounds 30,000 system on a DEC Vax minicomputer,
supporting 35 workstations. The system, called Info, includes all details of
contacts, connections and relationships, along with funds, products bought,
competitor activity and other account information. All of these financial
details are drawn upon for mailshots.
Because the project was bespoke, in-house staff wrote their own manual, but
all found the system very easy to use.
Michelle Lamb's advice is that the important element is getting the data
right - and that needs involvement from all levels: 'It's hopeless unless
you've got full support and it's being driven by senior management. In the
end, no-one will use it, not even the enthusiasts, if the data is not right.
The impetus has to come from the top: 'ownership' is vital, and especially
input from the marketing department.'
Confidence in the data, and its reliable, up-to-date integrity, are among
the system's benefits to Ms Lamb - 'now we're able to see the complete
account relationship, the next stage is to use it pro-actively.'

Laura Ashley - The fashion and furnishings company has a seamless link
between a human resources management system and a computer bureau for
processing the payroll - Payroll processing; User View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAURA ASHLEY now uses a computer bureau to process the payroll for its 4,000
employees, but until recently personnel administration was handled largely
manually. There were a few personal computers running spreadsheets but no
formal human resources system.
'It was previously a bit cock-eyed, with payroll driving the personnel
system when it should be the other way round, as it is now,' says human
resources director Roy Willis.
Mr Willis joined in 1990, when the company was starting its restructuring.
'Before, things were run by divisions but we now take a global view,' he
says. 'It was very difficult to get management information at corporate
level, so it made sense to install a system that was common to all.'
Laura Ashley was already using the Centrefile bureau for payroll processing
and chose the Hoskyns human resources management package, running on an IBM
AS/400 business minicomputer.
'I certainly didn't want to bring payroll back in-house,' Mr Willis says.
'For one thing, we would need extra people to manage it.'
Laura Ashley's computing department put a lot of work into developing a link
between the Hoskyns and Centrefile systems.
'We input all the data just once, through the human resources system, which
sends it to Centrefile, so there's no more or less work for us than if we
had our own payroll system,' Roy Willis says.
'Previously, we keyed in payroll data and sent it over telecommunications
links to Centrefile; we still do this, but through the human resources
system.'
He adds: 'We have as much integration as we would if we had brought it all
in-house. The link is virtually seamless.'
Laura Ashley is still in the early days and is building its database. But it
is already looking at the recruitment, absence monitoring and occupational
health modules.
'The system will make life much easier when managements ask for information
which has been so difficult to get with any consistency across the UK,' says
Roy Willis.
Eventually he expects departments to be not only accessing information
directly but also entering their own data.

explained - Marketing Databases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bureau, turnkey:
A bureau usually provides use of one software package on a particular
machine, usually a mainframe. In database marketing applications, the bureau
usually acts as 'caretaker' to the data for the customer.
Turnkey packages provide a 'bundle' of software and hardware from the same
supplier, usually with an element of tailoring to a basic offering.
CATI - Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing, also CAPI, Computer Aided
Programmed Interviewing:
The technique by which answers to market research questions are programmed
directly into the database to improve accuracy and speed of collection.
De-duplication:
This is the technique by which name and address data, (the basis of all
database marketing), is 'cleaned' for use. Duplication usually occurs at
data collection because of the variety of abbreviations and styles used by
people when filling in forms. For instance, J S Smith Esq, John Smith, Mr J
Smith, all used in different circumstances for the same person.
PAF - postal address files.
These are the Royal Mail's codes which, used on letters, identify the
address as one of a few houses int he area. These speed delivery for the
mail, ensure accuracy, and are now the basis for a number of 'profiling'
systems on a wide variety of computer hosts. These cross-reference the
postcodes with demographic data to define the likely socio-economic class
and other char acteristics of an addressee.
PAF contains 1.6m postcodes and 24m addresses.
SIC - Standard Industry Code:
This is a code that segments companies by the areas in which they operate.
It is usually included in profiling databases, (as held on CD-ROM) along
with company data such as address, phone, senior management, bankers,
auditors, business description, parent/subsidiary details, financial
statements, growth rates,business ratios and industry comparatives.
Soundex, 'fuzzy match':
A fuzzy match is one where the details of a particular record can be pulled
out from the database without an exact match. The key 'smith' used to search
names with a fuzzy match would be enabled to extract similar sounding
(soundex) items spelt differently: Smyth, Smythe Smithers.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (25): Seeking to
win friends and influence people - Telemarketing; Direct mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'In the next five years there will be two sorts of company, those who use
computers as a marketing tool, and those who face bankruptcy' - Warren
McFarlen, Harvard Business School
'JUST what I always wanted.' The phrase became a family joke for the
preposterous items to be found in a direct mail catalogue which kept
arriving, unrequested but persistent, at a household unlikely to provide a
warm welcome for a musical garden gnome.
Nowadays, the postcode alone would reveal social class and spending bracket.
Every time you fill in a form with name, address and other details, you
become hostage to the thousands of companies wanting to reach you with the
special offer you won't be able to resist.
Your name and address are grist to the database marketing mill. Squeezed by
the recession, pushed harder by the competition, more companies are looking
towards efficient use of information technology (IT) to help them make their
sales. And here at last is an area where IT can demonstrably prove its
value, not just in creating a systematic working environment, but in
providing data.
That data is likely to be used to seduce you into buying all sorts of
products and services direct, because, if it is accurate, the services might
well be what you are seeking. A previous sales and marketing issue of
Software At Work, (December 1991) concentrated on systems for progressing
and and managing sales leads. It brought into focus an emerging market, one
of the few boom areas of software development at present.
This return-visit deals with the initial marketing effort, winning leads,
identifying customers, and finding new prospects by telemarketing or direct
mail, with the aid of a marketing database.
The biggest issue facing people who embark on direct marketing is the
quality, accuracy and consistency of the data they require. It's all too
easy to assume that accounting information is adequate: it certainly is not.
The key facts usually exists in a morass of data, in different systems
throughout the company.
A point made by many users during their interviews is that there is usually
an overload of information. The challenge can be recognising it, thrashing
it out, consolidating it, and making it useful to the marketeers.
There can be other outside sources; market research, lists bought from
brokers, and profiling aids to fill in the background on names and
addresses. These include Acorn, the household classification provided by
CACI, Mosaic, a similar geo-demographic system from CCN, and Define, a
household and financial profiling system.
The providers of information are also getting more sophisticated. Ronin, an
international market research company, has enhanced Computer Aided Telephone
Interviewing (CATI) to include Expert System-Based Interviewing Software, a
technique for extracting more specific and detailed responses in a variety
of languages.
Taylor Nelson, the UK's largest market research organisation, uses barcode
data and computer links to poll the 8,500 homes on its consumer panel, and
provides the results in electronic format. CD-ROM discs make it easy to
disseminate large amounts of information, but the whole point of creating a
marketing database is to concentrate on quality, rather than volume of data.
The range of solutions is bewildering, ranging from microcomputer-based
systems such as Compass, to mainframe services such as CCN's. A remarkable
proportion of the users interviewed in this issue had chosen to 'outsource'
their marketing solution. They are using mainframes, specialist bureau
services and bespoke systems, solutions viewed as outdated elsewhere in the
computer industry. This swimming against the stream (in an era dedicated to
bringing things in-house on PC and client-server networks) might be
explained by the chasm that most marketing people felt between themselves
and in-house DP staff.
There is undoubtedly a need for specialist expertise. De-duplication of
names and addresses demands precise techniques, mastered by experts such as
The Computing Group, part of direct marketing company WWAV (Watson Ward
Albert Vandell).
Tony Masters, director WWAV advises that it is important to look at the
software product underpinning the marketing database: it has to be flexible.
'The technology is always moving forward. The percentage of turnover a
supplier spends on research and development is usually a good measure of
dedication.'
Forthcoming trade shows provide useful shop windows for those unsure where
to start. At last month's Business Computing Show, sales and marketing
systems arrived as a recognised sector.
More specialised is Softworld, a trade show dedicated to sales and
marketing, which uses 'interactive' techniques of presentations, workshops,
seminars and hands-on demonstrations as a showcase for a maximum of 45
software suppliers. The Softworld event manager, Jeremy Walker, who runs a
series of dedicated exhibitions, reports a boom in this particular niche
market - 'it's one of the last major growth areas for software, as yet to be
exploited in terms of applications products and installations. I know about
300 products in all, with about one new one per week.'
Christopher Bradley heads the sales and marketing IT consultancy group at
Coopers and Lybrand: he keeps count of every package supplier and most of
the 2,000 or so list brokers in the UK. He knows in excess of 250 UK sales
and marketing packages, and another 200 available in the US.
'The whole purpose of such systems is not just to win new sales,' he says.
'The real advantage comes not only from winning new sales, but in gaining
incremental profit on existing customers. The largest and most profitable
use of database marketing has been in cross-selling, improving lifetime
value. If we hammer home any one message, it's: 'Think of the lifetime value
 -not just the value of one sale.''
At Softworld, Mr Bradley represents the Association of Information Systems
in Marketing and Sales (AIMS), an organisation set up two years ago to
represent the suppliers of direct marketing software products and services.
There are all sorts of opportunities, he points out, for service companies
(such as electricity supply) to anticipate product needs, much as insurance
and financial companies already do. First, the industry has to lose its
reputation for bombarding the consumer with forest-loads of unsolicited,
duplicated mailshots.
'Please, keep the phrase 'junk mail' out of the headline . . . it's the very
thing we're trying to stamp out,' says Jeg Gray, marketing manager for
building society Northern Rock, (see page 17). He knows the power of a
direct appeal: it is on his shoulders, along with other colleagues in the
newly formed Direct Marketing Association, to make sure that database
marketing wins friends and influences people.
The DMA (UK), a more widely-based body than AIMS, was formed in April 1992,
as an association of advertisers, mailing houses, agencies, list brokers,
consultants and other parties in the industry. Mr Gray is well aware how
most people equate direct mail with waste paper through the letterbox - 'any
organisation which wants to have its customers buy additional products must
make sure that they do not annoy those customers by sending them totally
irrelevant mail,' he emphasises.
Mr Gray is convinced of the benefits of systematic database marketing, and
sees it as part of his job to convince the world at large of its benefits -
'the DMA is not interested in junk mail. We intend to advise and negotiate
with Whitehall, Westminster, and Brussels in order to position our industry
in its most favourable light, to win favour with the Great British Public.'
The unrequested but perfectly targeted missive should find a welcome on your
doormat, he argues. It could, after all, be offering you just what you
always wanted.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (21): Disciplined
but flexible approach pays off - The installation of an integrated personnel
and payroll system at Hotpoint, the domestic appliance supplier, is enabling
the company to give line managers control over their own staff information /
User View; Payroll and personnel functions at Hotpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIKE KEALEY, personnel manager at Hotpoint, the domestic appliance supplier,
has firm views on how to introduce human resources computer systems
successfully .
'Keep it simple, by concentrating on getting the basic information right
first,' he says. 'Bear in mind that it's a long process to build up all the
data you want in the system. You can give line managers ownership of
information on their staff, but personnel must keep control of data input.'
These simple tenets have stood Hotpoint in good stead as it has moved to an
integrated personnel and payroll package covering 6,500 employees at three
factories, a design department, a service operation and an administrative
headquarters split between Peterborough and North Wales.
Hotpoint used to run separate payroll and personnel packages on an IBM
mainframe computer. The company then moved to DEC Vax computers and started
looking for a new system. In particular, it wanted a single, integrated
system with one common database. This would avoid duplication and ensure
that the payroll and personnel functions were always working from the same
data.
'One of my hobby-horses is that you can duplicate information on computer
systems if you're not careful,' says Mike Kealey. 'You end up with different
systems holding the same data.'
He adds: 'Payroll data is the most accurate data you have. If someone
working for you is not recorded on the system, you'll soon know about is as
soon as his first pay day comes.
'With an integrated system personnel it is using the same data, which means
for example that line managers and financial people doing budgeting are
working from accurate information.'
Hotpoint chose the Sequel package from Imago - 'we started looking a year
ago and although there were lots of mainframe and personal computer packages
there was relatively little for mid-range computers,' says Mr Kealey.
'Imago was established and 100 per cent reliable, whereas some other
products were new or still under development,' he adds. Imago also offered
the right level of flexibility.
'Other suppliers offered their package and woe betide you if you wanted to
change it,' Mike Kealey says.
'For example, with one product we couldn't change a label shown against a
particular data field, although the supplier offered to do it at a price.
Our computing department has given us a lot of support, but we didn't want
to have to start relying on them to write special programs: we didn't want
to lose the ability to drive the system ourselves.
'In addition, we had developed our own screens in line with our own needs on
our previous system over a long period and we wanted the new system to
mirror these: why re-invent the wheel?
'Some suppliers provided masses of screens - but still didn't meet our
needs. They went overboard on the amount of employee information which could
be included, which meant basic information might go over several screens.
Imago offered us instead the flexibility to recreate our existing screens
and to improve on them using facilities such as pop-up windows.'
Mike Kealey stresses that the right procedures surrounding a computer system
are vital.
'People change address and get married and so on, so you have to have manual
procedures behind the system to keep the information up-to-date,' he says.
'We have set up update screens and designed a paper form which reflects the
screen layout. The form is filled in by the employee and then becomes a data
entry document. We have done a lot of internal publicity about the
availability and importance of these disciplined procedures.'
He adds: 'It's fine to have a wonderful system offering all sorts of
analyses, but you must get the basics right: you lose credibility if one of
these reports has got someone's name wrong.'
The personnel department is now starting to give line managers direct access
to information on their staff, generally using enquiry or report facilities
set up by personnel. A side benefit of this is that it is enforcing the
procedures.
'We recently gave the design director access, which meant ownership passed
to department level,' says Mike Kealey. 'This had the effect of quickly
bringing the information up to date: when the director started coming across
missing data he very quickly gathered it. Line managers want full and
accurate information.'
Even so, the personnel department has kept central responsibility for
updating records: a line manager might spot a gap but he then gets the
appropriate form completed, which goes to personnel for entry to the system.
The one area where line managers can enter data is that of training. The
factories and the design, service and headquarters operations all manage
their own training. In the past, they kept their own records on paper.
In future, the system will hold these records and the line managers are now
starting to enter information themselves directly.
'Training is decentralised and previously the records were too, but our aim
now is to centralise the records without centralising the workload,' says
Mike Kealey. 'This means we get corporate information on the amount of
training going on, while at individual level if someone moves from service
into design, for example, information about his previous training is not
lost, because it is recorded about him in the system.'

<TEXT>
PERSONNEL and payroll are just two out of 25 systems which are interlinked
as far as possible at East Herts Health Authority.
Since becoming a NHS trust and moving its computing away from North West
Thames Regional Health Authority, East Herts has installed a network of 20
DEC Vax and Microvax computers and around 200 personal computers. It has
adopted an open systems computing strategy designed to enable any system to
work with any other and with any data, where appropriate.
This strategy led to the choice of Peterborough Software's Open Door human
resources product, designed for open systems users running the Unix
operating system, which enables software to be moved between different
computers.
East Herts had already settled on the Ingres relational database management
package for other systems and chose Peterborough Software partly because
Open Door runs with Ingres.
'The linking of systems means, for example, that we are not just running
Open Door to pay people but also using the information in other ways from
day to day,' says East Herts computing consultant, Mr Mohan Solomon. 'For
instance, data is used by the nurse rostering system to match skills to
needs. Previously this was done manually and a ward might get two senior
sisters allocated to it.'
The integration of systems also means all activities can be costed
accurately; such information can be useful when it comes to looking at
contracting out individual activities.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (19): Cost-saving,
a big reason for contracting out - Payroll bureaux date back to the 1960s
yet they are still used by companies which have brought every other system
in-house. John Kavanagh finds out why / Payroll processing; Bureau Users'
Views

PAYROLL processing has traditionally been a mainstay of the computer bureau
business and even companies which are automating their personnel departments
are still happily contracting out the payroll. Even organisations which have
had bad experiences with payroll bureaux have simply switched to another
supplier, rather than take on the task themselves.
Yet these days there are endless payroll software packages available for
personal computers, minicomputers and mainframes of all kinds. In many cases
these packages can be integrated with personnel products which companies are
installing, enabling them to run these functions from a single database. But
still they prefer to have one of their most sensitive tasks handled by an
outside agency. Cost is a key reason mentioned by bureau users.
'We looked at bringing the payroll in-house when we changed bureaux, but it
would have been more expensive because we would have needed more people,'
says Mr Greg Judge, finance director at Manchester Polytechnic, the UK's
biggest polytechnic, with 3,000 staff.
The polytechnic switched to an on-line service provided by the CMG bureau in
April after growing frustration with another supplier. The previous bureau
had made basic mistakes such as running a payroll using an earlier month's
data.
Mr Ken Dodd, computing manager at Northumbria Ambulance Service, agrees. His
organisation uses the Compower bureau.
'We have one person managing the payroll and keying in all the data and we
would certainly need more if we ran the payroll in-house,' says Mr Dodd. 'In
addition our contract with Compower was 30 per cent cheaper than the
cheapest software package we looked at. It was also 20 per cent cheaper than
the nearest bureau competitor.'
A worthwhile investment
Greg Judge at Manchester Polytechnic points out that bureaux can keep costs
down because they use the same staff to run many companies' payrolls.
'This also means they have specialist expertise,' he says. 'Unless you have
a sizeable payroll section, it's difficult to attract suitably experienced
and qualified staff.
'Good payroll managers are hard to come by: people who are fully aware of
new legislation, penalties which the Inland Revenue and statutory pensions
authorities can impose and so on. It's worthwhile paying to have this taken
care of: a bureau takes on the risks and the problems of day-to-day
operation. I've worked for organisations which have taken the payroll
in-house and have got problems.'
Passing sensitive work and data to an outside contractor brings other
benefits, according to Mr Judge - 'the payroll can be disrupted during
industrial disputes,' he says. 'The management can in effect be held to
ransom by the payroll staff.
'In addition we have an executive payroll for heads of department and above:
people who are on individual contracts and benefits packages. Politically,
it can be better to have such information handled elsewhere rather than
internally: using a bureau means only two or three people in the poly have
access to this information.'
None of the bureau users contacted by Software At Work feel that their
payroll processing is out of their control. In some cases the work is
processed at computer centres many miles away: indeed, some of the users are
vague about where their suppliers' computers are - but feel that with modern
telecommunications this is of no concern. The user companies contacted are
quite large organisations which might need to make changes at short notice.
They have therefore all chosen or switched to services which accept data
keyed in on PCs at the customer-end and transmitted over telecommunications
links to the bureau just before the payroll is run.
Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest retail travel agent, for example, switched to
CMG last November after using a service which involved completing documents
by hand, sending them to the bureau for entering to the system, receiving
printouts of the information for checking, sending these back, checking the
corrections and so on.
'We had a deadline from the bureau which was two weeks before the payroll
run,' says Lunn Poly's chief accountant, Mr Simon Barge. 'This meant we were
always doing things outside the payroll to cope with late adjustments and
people joining the company.'
Mr Barge and others say that although they cannot start the payroll
processing run themselves they are in control.
'We tell CMG when we are ready to transmit data and we can generate report
printing runs from here, although the reports are printed at CMG,' says Mr
Barge.
Greg Judge at Manchester Polytechnic comments: 'CMG has a very flexible
package and you can specify virtually any reports you want. There are almost
unlimited permutations of the ways you can record and report on
employee-costs.'
Although a bureau holds its customers' employee master files, the data can
also be held at the customer end. Lunn Poly, for example, has taken a CMG
facility which transmits part or all of a payroll master file back to the
customer and includes a local report generator.
Lunn Poly can thus make enquiries to its own local version of the master
file, running on its network of Compaq personal computers. Indeed, as Mr
Barge points out, because changes to employee data can be entered to the
local database as they happen, this file is always more up to date than the
file held by CMG, which tends to be updated with all the changes only just
before a payroll run.
Even so, a bureau payroll system is still separate from an in-house
personnel system, not just because it is being run at a different site by a
different organisation but mainly because it is normally based on different
software and a separate database. Users contacted by Software At Work
generally recognise that the level of integration of the separate human
resources systems is not as great as it could be if everything was run
in-house, but they do not see this is a big inconvenience.
For some users this is partly because updates to payroll information, such
as the addition of new staff and changes in salary, are entered to the
in-house personnel package, which passes the data to the payroll bureau when
the customer gets its monthly processing slot.
These links, however, tend to be in one direction only: this means, for
example, that pure payroll data, such as overtime earnings, which generally
do not go through the personnel system but are keyed directly to the payroll
system, might not be readily available.
Northumbria Ambulance Service, a Percom personnel system user, has separate
payroll and personnel units - 'the definition of integration depends on how
far we want to go,' says Ken Dodd.
'Personnel can ask payroll for information. It's easy to get a person's
salary - but if you want to know how much a certain person earned on a
certain day, there might be more of a problem.'
Simon Barge at Lunn Poly, which has a personnel system developed in-house on
a Hewlett-Packard minicomputer, regards the reduced integration as a benefit
 -'full integration would save re-keying of information, but this in itself
is a control,' he says. If data is being entered from payroll and from
personnel, comparisons between the two serve as a clear-cut control.'
These and other users contacted are happy with their current bureau services
and it seems that as long as the services remain reliable, even big computer
users will prefer to contract out the payroll to specialist companies rather
than take all the risks themselves. For as Greg Judge at Manchester
Polytechnic puts it: 'For any employer, there's nothing so sensitive as
payroll.'

YOU become a computer programmer before you realise it. Spreadsheets are the
most common way that people become programmers. If asked, the person
concerned would call themselves an accountant or a clerk. Nevertheless, what
they do is programming.
Sometimes people grapple with - and master - tools that would make the
software professional shudder. Mr Julian Soltau of Mercantile and General is
a perfect example. He writes programs (which he calls reports) in one of the
most primitive languages around. The report language of the system was
extremely dated but he had conquered it and made it work for the business. I
felt this was a heroic achievement.
Mercantile &amp; General have blended the mainframe and the PCs well to suit
their requirements. They still have some way to go towards full integration
 -they are still manually copying some figures from one to the other.
However, the flexibility of the current system has enabled them to keep the
personnel head-count remarkably low for the work-load.
I suspect that Mr Soltau will be amazed at how far modern query languages
have come. The new report writer promised for the system should make his
life easier. He will then face the next joy of programming - converting all
his existing work over to the new system.
Key points from this study:
Ordinary people can master complex systems.
Even an imperfect system can produce good results if it is flexible.
It is more important to have tools than fixed solutions.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (16): Midland
Software - Supplier Profile
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Software is a privately-owned UK company formed in 1984 as a
specialist in human resources systems. In January 1992 the former Midland
Software and sister company Arcast merged under the Midland name.
Arcast focused on ICL computers and Midland on IBM but the trend towards
open systems, which free users from being tied into particular computer
manufacturers, led to the merger.
Turnover: Pounds 9m expected in 1992; Pounds 7m in 1991; Pounds 5.4m in
1990.
Employees: 160.
Product: Delphi, described as an integrated human resources system. It can
combine payroll, personnel and pensions, working with its own database or
using database management software from Ingres or Oracle. Hardware: there
are versions for IBM and ICL mainframes, for the IBM AS/400 business
minicomputer and for IBM-type personal computers. An open systems version
running under the Unix operating system was launched this year.
Price: products are rented and there is an initial one-off cost; rental
depends on the applications run and the number of employees. A company with
300 staff running payroll or personnel would pay around Pounds 2,000 and
then Pounds 200 a month. The rental includes maintenance. Customers: 250 in
the UK, mostly from the top 500 companies.
Various users' views:
Pros: 'The company is small and well-run, with long experience . . . the
system is easy to customise; needed far fewer users and technical staff than
normal to implement; users were able to drive the implementation; integrated
system; met specification for complex payroll.'
The only criticism - that 'the report generator is long-winded' - came from
existing users: no users of other products, interviewed by Software At Work,
mentioned Delphi as one of the systems they had considered and rejected.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (15): Key role in
the company - An integrated payroll, personnel and pensions package can
change a personnel unit's outlook and raise challenges for line managers /
Application Case Study; Mercantile and General Reinsurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MERCANTILE and General Reinsurance has moved from separate payroll, pensions
and personnel systems to a single integrated package run by a small
personnel department. The move has enabled the department to evolve from a
largely administrative unit into an operation playing a key role in the
whole management of the company, its people and its costs.
Mercantile and General claims to be the biggest reinsurance company in the
UK and in the top six, worldwide. In the UK it has 750 staff at offices in
London and at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and pensions information
involving another 250. For much of the 1980s the company was using a
computer bureau for payroll and its own mainframe computer system for
personnel. Pensions were run manually by actuaries.
'On the payroll side, we had two staff filling in forms, which went to the
bureau to be keyed in,' says personnel and administration manager Mr Mike
Marshall, who is based in Cheltenham. 'We then got reports back for
checking, sent those back for correction and so on.
'This process meant we had to send the information three weeks before our
pay day. We just got half-a-dozen very basic reports. We felt we were losing
control and wanted to bring the system in-house.
'Meanwhile, we had a bespoke personnel system running on our own mainframe
computer. This produced rigid reports which could not be changed easily.
There were no links with the payroll system.'
Mr Marshall had a simple aim when he started looking for a new system: 'I
wanted something that would provide information on people from cradle to
grave.'
This aim led the company to seek a system which could handle the payroll,
personnel and pensions functions from a single database of staff information
rather than separate files, as in the past.
As a simple example of such integration of functions, recording personnel
data on a new recruit would mean he would be added automatically to the
pension scheme as soon as he became eligible; in addition, a person's
pension could be calculated at any time from payroll and personnel data.
Mr Marshall also wanted a system which could be controlled from the
personnel department - 'personnel never gets much in central computing
resource, because the core business systems quite rightly get priority.'
The company started by looking for mainframe computer packages but came
across a personal computer product called Delphi from Midland Software.
'The attraction of a PC system is that the central computing department
doesn't have to be involved at all,' says Mr Marshall. The initial emphasis
was on payroll, with some personnel jobs, such as salary planning, being
done from the payroll data. However, as experience increased and more
personnel tasks were added, screen response times fell away and the
department out-grew the personal computer system. So it switched to the
mainframe version of Delphi, running on Mercantile and General's IBM-type
computer from manufacturer Amdahl.
However, the department still wanted to keep total control over its system
and not become dependent on the computing department - 'with a mainframe
package we faced the prospect of having to call the operators to ask them to
run our programs every time we wanted to do something,' says Mr Julian
Soltau, a personnel officer recruited specifically to handle the computer
system and to do market research into salary trends, benefit packages and so
on.
'We therefore worked with the computer department to devise a front-end
system which enables us to pick an option, such as running the payroll, on a
workstation at our end and get it processed automatically on the mainframe.
All the reports and pay-slips are directed through the network back to our
office and printed there.
'This arrangement means that even though the system is running on the
central computer, the only time the operators are directly involved is when
we run the payroll and it displays a message on their console asking them to
load a tape to collect data for sending to the BACS automated payments
service.'
When Mercantile and General received the mainframe version of Delphi the
personnel section consisted of blank screens. This was in the early days of
the product: Midland Software now supplies screens already laid out, to get
customers started more quickly.
'Midland Software provides a powerful tool for creating screens,' says Mr
Soltau. 'We had payroll, personnel and pensions data in different places, so
we did some data analysis with the computing people. We had some
brainstorming sessions in our own department and we used our imaginations to
work out what we wanted.'
The Delphi report and screen generators have enabled Mr Soltau to produce
numerous and often complex enquiry facilities and management reports. He
describes the generators as 'very powerful but long-winded': for example for
some analysis work it is quicker to extract data from Delphi and load it
into a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet. But he adds that Midland Software recognises
this and is work ing on it.
Mr Soltau describes himself as a personnel man with a great interest in
computing and some aptitude for it. This combination of characteristics has
done much to enable the personnel department to maintain its control over
its system and to develop new reports and enquiry screens: Mike Marshall
knows of some Delphi users who rely on their computing departments to
prepare reports and screens for managers. Mr Marshall says the wealth of
information which can be obtained from the system has brought a move from
passive to active personnel management.
At business management level, budgeting has become increasingly important,
he says, and the personnel system now makes a significant contribution. It
provides regular information on expenses by department for the management
costing system, showing, for example, just how much it has cost to promote a
particular person, in terms of company car, National Insurance and so on.
At a detailed level, here Mr Marshall's team can produce reports showing the
effect of providing cars of different engine sizes and the cost of replacing
cars every three years.
'I might be talking about company cars to a department manager and he might
not believe the number and the costs,' Mr Marshall says. 'I can show him how
the number has grown and the impact on his costs.'
Some divisions of the company practise job rotation to give potential high
flyers experience of different aspects of the business. Their job-moves and
training are recorded by the system.
Mike Marshall hopes to add appraisal information and this helps with
succession planning - 'if we are likely to need someone in London with two
years' underwriting experience, who can speak French, we can search the
database for candidates,' he says. 'If there is no match, we can find people
with some of the required characteristics and plan some training in the
missing ones.'
Another example of active personnel management lies in the production of
reports showing the proportion of women in different grades. Such
information can be used to alert managers to the possibility that they are
discriminating against women.
Mr Marshall has numerous examples of the reports and enquiry screens which
have been built on to the system.
'With an integrated system we can take any data item and link it with any
other,' he says. One issue now is whether the business managers can
themselves adapt to this active type of personnel management.
'Some managers have not yet fully grasped the implications of the
information we're giving them,' says Mike Marshall says. He is looking at
ways of getting these managers more closely involved in their own
information, eventually by allowing them to keep their own staff data up to
date and to make their own enquiries through the networked personal
computers which they already have in their departments for other purposes.
Again, the personnel department is being pro-active here. It is taking on
Midland Software's training administration screens, which will integrate
with the existing payroll and personnel data. Users can define training
modules and allocate staff to them within specified periods; the package
also handles bookings and throws up lists of the equipment needed by an
internal training department for a particular course.
'This will be our first big step in taking the personnel system out to the
managers for them to use themselves,' Mike Marshall says. 'They control
their own training budgets and will be able to arrange training for their
own staff, directly through the system.'
One further development which would be useful but which is not planned for
the immediate future is a connection to Mercantile and General's time and
attendance system. This system, from Hengstler, involves clocking-in units
linked to a personal computer. It helps the company to manage its flexible
working hours. This system is being updated to show long history information
which could help the company spot, for example, people who regularly take
sick leave on Fridays.
The personnel department is now supported in all these developments from the
top of the company, not least because it is providing top management with
information on the company's biggest expense: the staff and their related
costs.
'It takes a long time to get all the data and reports set up and then to be
successful,' Mike Marshall says. 'But we get management support. We are a
low-cost operation, because we have done it all ourselves on the computing
front.
'For example, in payroll we have absorbed all the legislative changes,
maintained the data and ensured everyone gets paid with just one person;
when we used the bureau we needed two people. Similarly, we have one person
running pensions and our company mortgage scheme and two personnel officers
and an assistant. In addition we have Julian Soltau and his assistant.'
He adds: 'The desire to be pro-active has always been there, but we have
never had the resources, for example, to go through hundreds of files to
find out how many people have cars with two-litre engines and work out the
impact on company costs.
'Using a system like this means we can provide any information pro-actively
with minimum resources.'

THERE can be few things more disconcerting for a union negotiator than to
see the management costing all your demands on a PC in front of you.
KLM has integrated its system well enough to make this a practical reality.
While shifting the balance of power towards managers, it also allows options
to be considered that might otherwise have been rejected.
Mr McCammon has shown remarkable talent in assembling a complex custom
system from a collection of standard parts. The choice of a PC-based system
has allowed him to select from a vast range of software options. The use of
networks has allowed the system to have adequate power. After all,modern PCs
have more raw power than many mainframes of only a few years ago. Though not
all the links are yet filled in, the system meets the current needs.
Unusually, Mr McCammon enters all the data himself - partly to ensure its
correctness, but he does it mainly to keep him in touch with all that is
happening in the company. This seems an excellent use of his time, given
that it only takes an hour a day. Most executives would palm this off to a
junior and then find themselves out of touch.
The direct and indirect savings are many times the cost of the system. It is
a tribute to the skills of Mr McCammon and his staff and no surprise that
they won a national award.
Key lessons from this study:
Choose a flexible and extensible architecture.
Get something done now, even if it is not yet perfect.
Own the data from the top.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (12): A boon for

BRITISH WATERWAYS has installed a network of IBM AS/400 business
minicomputers in regional offices which previously did not even have many
electric typewriters. The move, part of a devolution of power to the five
regions, has given local managers immediate on-line access an control of
their own financial, human resources and other information.
The network has replaced a central computing set-up, based on a Unisys
mainframe running systems, which in some cases were 20 years old.
British Waterways is responsible for 2,000 miles of inland waterways and the
associated boat-licensing, moorings, waterside property development and sale
of water to industry and supply companies. It has around 2,000 employees.
The limited experience of administration people with any form of office
automation meant that user-support was going to be important in the choice
of supplier.
'Peterborough Software were very helpful and gave excellent support to
users,' comments Mr Keith Labbett, head of audit, who was in charge of
implementing the computing strategy. 'They had standard procedures and
guidance notes, which were very useful for users who had not implemented a
system before.'
British Waterways has installed Peterborough Software's Unipay and
Unipersonnel packages. These are run centrally - 'payroll in particular is a
difficult beast, with Budget changes every year. It's hard to keep up if the
system is installed in six places.'
However, the network enables the regions to be in control of their own
information. They enter data to the systems and can access information and
work on it locally.
'The old systems were inflexible and the information was not timely and
sometimes not even accurate,' Keith Labbett says. 'We now have immediate
access down to the level where decisions are made. The central human
resources unit now acts as an advisory team: the networked system means each
manager can become his own personnel manager, too.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (10): KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines - Company Snapshot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a difficult year for the airline industry and the onset of price wars
over the Atlantic, KLM reported a 72 per cent decline in first-quarter net
profit in mid-August, due partly to a widening of losses at NorthWest
Airlines, the US carrier in which it owns a substantial minority stake.
Other factors behind the downturn were higher interest charges and the
absence of book profits on the sale of aircraft. KLM is in the midst of a
cost-cutting programme, but productivity of its workforce improved by 14 per
cent, compared with the first quarter last year, says the company.
In the UK, KLM is based at Hatton Cross, Heathrow Airport: it has 670 staff
at 10 UK sites.
Human resources systems: Percom for personnel, recruitment, organisation
charting, training administration; Smart Systems for time recording and
rostering; SPA Plan for pensions; Saville and Holdsworth for interviewing
and psychometric testing; Lotus for spreadsheets (1-2-3) and desk-top
publishing (Freelance); Percom and Multimate for word processing; Carapay
bureau for payroll. The systems run on a Novell network linking IBM personal
computers. System cost: Pounds 100,000.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (9): Award-winning
system - KLM is saving more than Pounds 500,000 a year after linking 12 PC
personnel packages / Case study; Personnel management
</HEADLINE>

LAST YEAR, KLM's UK personnel department won an award from the Institute of
Personnel Management for linking 12 personal computer software packages.
However, the Information Technology in Personnel Award was not for technical
achievement but a recognition of the way the department has used computers
to improve the whole UK company's performance.
For a one-off purchase cost of around Pounds 100,000, it has enabled the
company to cut costs by at least Pounds 500,000 a year. KLM now has packages
for everything from personnel and pensions to time-recording,
staff-rostering, training administration, job applicant interviewing and
psychometric testing. As UK personnel manager Mr David McCammon puts it: 'We
believe there's hardly anything that human resources people do that can't be
assisted by computer and there are so many specialist software companies
around offering very high-class products.'
KLM has 670 UK staff at 10 locations across the UK, although most are at the
administrative headquarters on the edge of London's Heathrow Airport or
working at the airport itself in passenger handling, baggage loading and so
on.
In the 1980s all personnel tasks were handled manually but a growing work
load brought the department to the point where it had to choose between
increasing its staff of six and moving into computing.
KLM started towards automation in 1986 by contracting the payroll processing
out to a computer bureau and buying a personnel management system from
Percom. The first bureau wanted to sell its personnel processing service too
and became unwilling to provide links with KLM's in-house Percom package, so
the airline has now switched to the Carapay bureau.
However, the biggest headache and a long-standing problem for all airlines
was staff rostering: how to make the most productive use of staff who only
had work to do when an aircraft was arriving or being prepared for a flight.
The last flight might be completed two hours before the end of a shift,
giving staff a short day, yet on other days a late flight might demand
overtime. As Mr McCammon says: 'Shortened shifts are very nice for staff,
but a disaster for productivity and ultimately threaten jobs.'
Rostering is complex: different types of aircraft, the number of passengers,
whether there are mailbags on board and so on mean the mix of staff needed
can change from one shift to the next.
KLM already had a manual clocking-in system, so it automated this using a
software package from Smart Systems and added the company's rostering
package. Links were set up from the personnel system and into the payroll
service.
'We can now organise work and people to make sure there is work to do,' Mr
McCammon says. 'It was impossible to do this with the manual system because
there are so many variables and combinations of those variables.'
The improved rostering, bringing better use of staff and a cut in overtime,
is saving KLM around Pounds 400,000 a year. In addition, there is immediate
information on a day's operating costs.
'Our financial controller can see from day to day how much overtime is being
worked, for example, and seek an immediate explanation from line managers,'
David McCammon says. 'With the manual system it could be six weeks before
such information came through. Managers can now ask and answer immediate and
relevant questions, because the information is immediately available.'
A side benefit here is that the possibility of colleagues clocking in and
out for each other has been eliminated: the system uses a personal barcode
which is printed on the pass that each person needs to get through airport
security to their workplace. They cannot get someone else to clock in for
them, because the clock-in card is now part of the security pass they need
to get to work in the first place.
The automated capturing of attendance data has brought other benefits. The
information is transmitted over a telecommunications link to Carapay to keep
the payroll records up to date. This has eliminated the errors associated
with manual systems, when figures are written on forms.
Under the old system there was a six per cent error rate. The automated data
capture and transmission has saved an estimated one man-year of work per
year. In addition the computer system's analysis facilities have helped cut
sick leave by more than a third.
KLM keeps detailed records here, grouping reasons for absence into
categories such as head, back and chest, with seven or eight sub-groups,
such as migraine and headache, in each category. This information can
pinpoint people who take an above average number of sick days but is also
used to discover potential problems created by the work: for example,
whether there is more back trouble among baggage loaders, which might
indicate that they need new training in lifting techniques.
The information has also been used to measure the effect of KLM's flu
vaccination campaign: absences caused by flu are down 30 per cent. KLM
decided three years ago to concentrate on cutting sick leave by using the
system in this way.
As part of the campaign it took on an occupational nurse and introduced
schemes such as a cash prize draw for people who had no sick leave for three
months. The results are striking: the average number of sick days has fallen
from 10.4 in 1990 to seven this year.
'Without a computer system we couldn't even begin to measure absence in this
level of detail,' says David McCammon.
On the pensions side, KLM uses a package from SPA Plan - 'we used to use
actuaries, who are very expensive,' Mr McCammon says. 'We are now saving
Pounds 8,000 a year here and we can respond more quickly to staff
enquiries.'
Other packages have been added over the years. Percom's recruitment package
enables one person to handle all recruitment administration, including
dealing with the 5,000 unsolicited job applications that KLM receives each
year. It has stored 70 standard letters in the system and can tailor these
to individual applicants.
It also stores details on every applicant so that if a vacancy arises it can
enter the required qualifications to retrieve people who might fit the bill.
This has cut advertising costs and enabled the company to fill vacancies
very quickly: within a few hours of receiving a recent request for 15
warehouse staff the personnel department had selected 150 people and written
to invite them for interviews.
A psychometric testing package and an interviewing package, both from one of
Europe's leading occupational psychology firms, Saville and Holdsworth, have
also helped with recruitment. With the interviewing package, users enter up
to 25 personal characteristics they are seeking from a list of 64 and the
system throws up suggested questions for the interview.
'This is an example of a specialist little package costing around Pounds 300
which brings huge benefits,' says David McCammon. 'It in effect uses the
experience of leading occupational psychologists. And the questions are
good, open-ended ones which bring people out. You get better interviews and
probably better recruits.
'Using the system also increases the personnel department's professional
image in the eyes of line managers.'
Percom's organisation chart system shows individuals and their jobs and who
reports to them and also details such as their age and length of service,
which KLM uses for succession planning.
The training administration package, also from Percom, holds details of
courses and enables managers to allocate people to them, send the details to
the staff, compare costs with training budgets and so on.
The Lotus Freelance product is used for desk-top publishing, producing
charts for management, training manuals and newsletters. The Lotus 1-2-3
spreadsheet package is also used, notably for modelling the impact of
changes in staff, salaries and so on: indeed, a personal computer is taken
into negotiations with unions so that proposals and counter-proposals can be
modelled immediately to see the likely impact.
Users can load data automatically into 1-2-3 from the Percom. Most of these
products are linked together through the personnel department's Novell
network of IBM personal computers; others exchange information on disc.
But despite the level of integration, there are still some significant links
missing. At present data on new recruits, pay rises and other factors
affecting the payroll is entered to the personnel system and sent to the
time recording system, which sends it to the payroll bureau. However, the
personnel package cannot accept information from the time recording or
payroll systems. This means, for example, that although the personnel system
holds a person's basic salary it does not get information on overtime.
'If we get an enquiry about total earnings, when a person applies for a
mortgage, we have to ask separately for the payroll details to get the
overtime,' says David McCammon.
Similarly, information on sick leaves has to be keyed in to the personnel
system - 'full integration would save time, and we are looking at getting
this link in the next 12 months,' Mr McCammon says. However, nothing dulls
his enthusiasm for all the systems.
'There are so many wonderful little packages you can pull off the shelf and
get working in half an hour, with great returns,' he says. 'Even a big
company could go this way. If it can split its operation into units of, say,
2,000 people, it can use these cheap PC packages.'
Mr McCammon is so keen that he spends an hour a day at his keyboard doing
mundane data entry of basic data on new recruits, salary changes and so on:
keyboard work that anyone could do.
'Hands-on experience is very important,' he says. 'I spend an hour a day on
data entry and three hours a day getting information out. Entering data
gives me a very good knowledge of the Percom system, so I can get the most
out of it when it comes to seeking information. Senior managers should get
more hands-on experience: I'm sure many personnel managers are wasting
opportunity by not knowing the full potential of their systems.
'At the same time, doing data entry keeps me up to date with what's
happening in KLM.'
The systems have enabled the personnel department to change its own
organisation and to become a more pro-active service to managers. For
example, the time-saving aspects have enabled David McCammon's secretary not
only to become a personnel assistant but also to do all the company's
training on word processing and spreadsheets. This is saving KLM the Pounds
20,000 a year it used to spend on outside training organisations.
The pensions administrator now has the time and the information to go round
the company giving talks on pensions and advising staff. And the recruitment
person is available for careers counselling. The personnel department is
working on showing managers the type of information that is available.
'Some managers make really good use of the information but others perhaps
need training in the sort of questions they can ask us,' says David
McCammon. 'They don't fully understand yet just how much information we can
give them to help them manage their departments.'
The unions, too, are catching on to the potential of this
information-handling tool - 'the unions have been very supportive and
actually use the system: as a simple example they ask us for addressed
labels when they want to ballot their members.'
The success of the UK personnel department has led KLM operations in
Belgium, France and Germany to take on the Percom system. Greece is taking
the time recording package and the US operation is looking at what the UK is
doing. David McCammon is the ideal person for them to talk to. He turns back
to the keyboard and taps keys at lightning speed to put together yet another
complex report, listing people of specified grades in a specific department
belonging to a specified union, with their individual salaries plus an
average for the group.
'I know nothing about computers, but I do know this system and that we have
at our fingertips every bit of information we need to help run this company
efficiently,' he says.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (7): Promise of big
benefits - Innovative companies are using integrated software systems to
help manage human resources. They are frequently enjoying a big return on
their investments / Management briefing; Personnel packages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PEOPLE are arguably both a company's biggest expense and its most important
resource, yet use of full human resources computer systems to help control
the expense and manage the resource is patchy. Payroll systems have been
around since the early days of commercial computing, but personnel packages
are much more recent and integrated systems - combining all human resources
functions - are only just starting to take off.
'Personnel has always been a wild and woolly area,' says Mr John Mills,
chairman and chief executive of human resources software specialist Midland
Software.
'The traditional view is that no one tells the personnel manager what to do.
Indeed, in some areas, where there have been industrial relations problems,
the personnel department might have been more or less running the company.
This function has been one of the most resistant to computer systems.'
Personnel managers interviewed by Software At Work back this view to a point
but add that personnel automation has always taken second place to key
business systems such as accounting, order processing, manufacturing control
and stock management.
Yet as this issue of Software At Work shows, companies which have introduced
human resources systems are enjoying big returns on their investments. KLM,
for example, is saving over Pounds 500,000 a year through better staff
rostering, a 33 per cent cut in sick leave and more productive use of human
resources staff, all for a one-off cost of Pounds 100,000, (see case study:
page 8).
The key to the success at KLM and virtually all the other companies
interviewed has been the emergence of personnel systems running on personal
computers and supplied by software houses specialising in this field. This
has enabled personnel departments to overcome the problem of the low
priority given to the development of their systems. The PC package has
enabled the personnel department to set up and run its own systems from day
to day.
In some cases the database is held on the company's central mainframe
computer but control still resides in the personnel department, which
manages and accesses the information through personal computers. This
development is reflected in the 1992 Computers in Personnel survey, carried
out by the Institute of Manpower Studies. It shows that only 30 per cent of
personnel systems have the central computing department as their main source
of support, even though 38 per cent are being run on the mainframe. The
survey also reflects the emergence of software packages in this area:
two-thirds of companies with personnel systems have bought in packages and
less than a quarter are using systems developed in-house. Around 75 per cent
say their systems are acceptable or good; 80 per cent have similar views on
the technical support they get. However, the emergence of personnel systems
has raised the issue of integration with other systems, notably payroll and
pensions.
A way of controlling costs
The argument here is that data from these traditionally separate areas is
used by all three, so it makes sense to integrate the systems. This then
makes it possible to get precise information on individuals, teams and
departments from day to day to help control costs, model the impact of pay
increases or company cars, look at promotion or redundancy costs and any
other information, the extent of which is restricted only by the limits of
the user's imagination.
Integration can mean taking the approach offered by Midland Software and a
few other package suppliers of installing a single system. Or it can mean
linking separate packages from a single or different suppliers, perhaps even
including a payroll system run by an external computer bureau.
John Mills at Midland Software says a survey of big organisations by his
company shows that around five per cent set up integrated systems between
1984 and 1990 and another 15 per cent in the last two years. Around 30 per
cent will go this way over the next two years and another 30 per cent in the
mid-1990s, leaving 20 per cent looking towards the end of the century before
they take this step.
Mr Colin Richards-Carpenter, associate director of the Institute of Manpower
Studies, believes that links between personnel and payroll are needed at
very least.
'Our survey shows that only a third of personnel systems are linked directly
with payroll, although 44 per cent of managers say they need this facility
in future,' he says. 'But this leaves nearly a quarter of personnel systems
users saying a link with payroll is not required. Can someone explain the
thinking behind this?'
Even so, Mr Richards-Carpenter adds: 'It is surprising how advanced some
organisations are in connecting their personnel systems to others: for
example, 10 per cent have links with pensions, 44 per cent with spreadsheets
and 31 per cent with other systems.'
The Institute of Manpower Studies survey also shows that a third of
organisations have added modules for tasks such as recruitment
administration and training management and that most others see such
additions as high priorities.
Surprisingly, Mr Richards-Carpenter says, the areas in which little is being
done are costing, budgeting and manpower planning. John Mills at Midland
Software argues that the integration issue highlights the need for top
management concern with personnel.
'The current fragmentation is due to the lack of recognition of the
importance of personnel work, both by senior management and by personnel
itself,' Mr Mills says. 'Personnel has had changing priorities over the last
20 years: we've been through the industrial relations problems of the 1970s
and early 1980s and then the emphasis switched to staff communications and
more recently to business restructuring. So it has not been clear to
personnel what they want in terms of systems.'
There has also been the political problem of departmental boundaries, with
payroll often coming under the finance department. But an integrated system,
with just one set of records, transcends departmental boundaries - 'such
issues demand that this whole area needs to be looked at by the most senior
management.'
Human resources systems are also raising issues for line managers. Personnel
managers interviewed by Software At Work say many of the line managers they
serve are bemused by the amount of highly detailed information now available
to them. Previously, personnel had problems even supplying the number of
people in a department; now it can offer lists of people who speak French
and have two-litre cars, if required.
Personnel managers say their systems have enabled their departments to
become active service organisations, examining costs and trends and taking
this information out to the line managers. But many line managers do not
know what questions they can now ask. One way to help them is to give them
direct access to the information through their own personal computers.
Some companies are introducing access gradually, for example by letting
managers book courses for their staff through the system. As KLM's personnel
manager, Mr David McCammon, puts it: 'It's better if line managers run a
company, rather than personnel. These systems provide the information to
enable them to do that, but it can take time to change people's
perceptions.'
The satisfaction with personnel systems, largely confirmed by the Institute
of Manpower Studies survey, and the rapidly increasing take-up of these
systems reflected in other surveys, suggest that this could be a big growth
area in the 1990s.
As Colin Richards-Carpenter at the Institute of Manpower Studies says: 'The
modern personnel system is a very powerful tool and organisations seem to be
having few problems justifying the investment.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (8): Multinational
prefers 'one stop' software shopping - Citibank integrates its European
Banking Network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIBANK is one of a growing number of multinationals which are opting for a
one-stop shop in information technology (IT). The new breed is tired of
having to sign numerous contracts with the same computer supplier in
different countries. And it is no longer willing to leave IT strategy and
purchasing up to individual subsidiaries.
Previously, Citibank (the retail banking arm of Citicorp of the US) did not
get the full benefit of its investment in technology. For example, if an
improvement was made to banking software in, say, Germany, it was not always
spread to other subsidiaries. Co-ordinating IT projects which involved more
than one subsidiary also involved a lot of management time. But last year
Citibank opted to use one main supplier, Philips Information Systems (now
part of Digital Equipment Corporation), to supply systems and software for
over 400 offices of its European consumer banking network.
Citibank is not alone in choosing the one-stop approach. As business
pressures increase and the Single Market looms, multinationals are trying to
derive maximum competitive advantage from their international status. A
well-integrated European IT system helps by allowing information to be
exchanged quickly and better-informed decisions to be made.
In Citibank's case, it wants to become a dominant supplier of pan-European
banking services to counter increasing competition at home. It also hopes to
win more business from high-margin customers.
These customers, it argues, will expect the same service whether they go
into a bank in Brussels or one in Dusseldorf. They will also expect new
products and services to be developed and introduced quickly.
The system which will make this possible will be one of the largest
Windows-based client-server networks in Europe with 5,000 'client' pcs.
These will be able to run a variety of applications locally, and will also
be able to issue commands to larger computers on the network (Unix
'servers'). Work has started in Germany and Belgium and the system should
reach other parts of Europe soon.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (5): When is an
import an acquisition? - The impact of rule changes regarding the movement
of goods within the single European market is only just beginning to dawn on
many UK companies / New VAT regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON JANUARY 1, next year, new VAT regulations come into force in the European
Community, the most far-reaching changes since VAT was introduced 19 years
ago. By 1997, a Community-wide system will be in place, but in the meantime,
the new regulations bridge the gap between the 1997 rules and the current
national VAT systems. This is one step along the road to creating a single
market of 380m consumers.
In effect, the 1993 changes abolish fiscal and physical border controls. The
complex paperwork presently required to import and export goods across
borders will be replaced with a set of regular reports and statistics.
There are three separate requirements:
EC sales listings.
Requirement to account for the acquisition of goods.
The statistical returns, known as 'intrastat,' which record the intra-EC
movement of goods.
In some cases, (businesses paying more than Pounds 2m VAT a year), returns
or at least VAT payments will have to made monthly instead of every three
months. There will be heavy penalties for those unable to supply the
information within the time limit.
Although the new regulations are designed to simplify import/export work,
they are likely to create more work in other quarters. They shift the focus
to accounting procedures, because they ask for information which has not up
to now been systematically stored.
To introduce any level of automation, most existing computerised accounting
systems will be affected: sales order-processing, purchase order-processing,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, fixed assets and inventory.
Even if freight forwarders undertake to register the information, most
companies will still have to cope with a substantial amount of manual
collection and collation of information to submit their VAT reports.
Few companies are fully prepared for the changes, which demand that all
goods bought, sold or transferred between EC countries appear on VAT returns
as acquisitions (imports) or despatches (exports).
'The VAT people think it's a problem for the systems people, and the systems
people think it all belongs to the VAT people,' comments Richard
Collier-Keywood, a tax partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
His mission is to put a sense of urgency into companies who have done little
so far to prepare. He estimates that only a tenth of those affected have
begun to assess the detailed system changes, which will apply to the top 24
per cent of traders, accounting for 97 per cent of the value of all exports
and imports.
'Unless they have replaced a system in the last couple of years, the vast
majority of companies will still be working with national systems which have
grown organically as the company has grown.'
Implications are dawning
The adjustment of internal, particularly bespoke systems will cause the
biggest headaches, he suggests. Package suppliers can cater for the changes
within their own software, and some have done so, but users have to cope
with systems integration, particularly the passage and recording of data
between systems.
'People are beginning to get the message,' he concludes. 'The volume of
concerned phone calls is mounting as people realise the implications.'
Among the points he highlights from the 50 or so pages of VAT legislation
are the requirements by January 1993:
Lists of VAT registration numbers of customers.
EC sales listings for intra-EC export sales.
Systems to recognise intra-EC imports to make them subject to the reverse
VAT charge procedure and account correctly for output and input VAT.
Detailed statistical returns for both imports and exports for each
transaction.
Ability of systems to cope with several different VAT rates (from 1997).
From 1992, the new boxes 6 and 7 on the VAT return form have to be completed
by importers and exporters. From 1993, the extra requirements will be added
to the VAT100 form: VAT on goods acquired from other member states, and a
subtotal output tax. There will be a small de minimis limit which will
enable smaller companies not to submit the EC sales listing.
As not all of Europe is within the EC, existing systems will have to
distinguish between EC and non-EC countries. Freight forwarders and clearing
agents have in the past dealt with the import/export requirements (the
Single Administrative Document), so they are in a good position to help with
the new data regulations.
The customs authorities are ready to encourage the use of electronic data
interchange (EDI) techniques to ease paperwork, and systems already exist to
take advantage of this.
Computing Services for Industry, a UK-based software house, has developed
its CIEL/400 freight forwarding software to cope with the new regulations,
producing the new Intrastat data as well as the SAD.
One of Europe's largest freight forwarding operators, the Swedish-based
Bilspedition group, has already licensed the system worldwide. Even if such
systems relieve some of the administrative overhead, most companies will
have to retrain and re-deploy staff.
Inevitably the change means considering introducing new systems, or
augmenting existing ones by downloading new data. In making the changes,
users and software developers who have invested in flexible development
tools (software engineering) will begin to see the payoff. Their systems
should be more forgiving of such major additions and changes. But even the
best-prepared will have to be quick on their feet to comply. Some countries,
namely Greece and Italy, have not even produced draft legislation, and by
July, only Denmark and Ireland had ratified their laws. For details on the

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (6): Overcoming
time-zone problems - Pepsi-Cola International / Messaging network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEPSI-COLA INTERNATIONAL is going to base the hub of its new messaging
network in Britain, although its headquarters are in the US. Why? Because
the UK business day overlaps with part of the business day in each of the
main countries in which the company operates.
This enables Pepsi-Cola International (a subsidiary of US food and drink
company, PepsiCo) to provide users with a single source of support. It is
particularly important when the company is trying to consolidate monthly
figures from around the world, some coming from areas where
telecommunication links are poor.
The centre can advise on alternative ways of sending figures into the
messaging system (eg via telex machine).
Another factor in Pepsi's choice of location was that some telecommunication
charges in Britain were among the lowest of the countries it looked at.
The system, which goes live in October, will be managed and supported by US
computer company Digital Equipment Corporation from its UK centre at
Newbury, Berkshire.
The main hub of the network, a Vax computer in Newbury, will provide
electronic mail (e-mail) and file transfer (including spreadsheets) between
personal computers located at 60 of Pepsi's offices worldwide. The network
is based on the internationally-agreed X400 electronic mail (or 'e-mail)
standard.
Digital will run the messaging system under a five-year, fixed-price,
single-supplier agreement worth Pounds 2.5m. It will bill Pepsi companies in
dollars via electronic mail, but they will pay in local currency.
Vicki Hill, Pepsi-Cola International's US-based telecommunications manager,
says the messaging system offers higher speeds and more flexibility than the
company's current messaging system. It will also cost Pounds 3.5m less over
five years.
In addition, she expects e-mail to replace some telephone calls, especially
across time zones.

has sidelined too many British companies when operating in Europe

THE hot topic in this issue of Software at Work is also a hot potato. In
less than four months' time, from the start of 1993, new European value
added tax (VAT) regulations will come into force, (see next page). Few
companies are prepared for the change, which will effectively abolish import
and export paperwork for intra-EC trade, but instead bring them within the
scope of additional reporting requirements.
But accounts and paperwork are only a part of a much broader subject which
includes national regulations, language, and culture. All of these factors
have an impact on software, not only for the developers of software
packages, but for the international operators who have to integrate systems
across different national borders.
Software At Work has already touched on this topic in previous issues, when
interviewing companies such as Unilever (Spring 1992 issue). There are a few
truly global companies who have blazed trails in 'global software': they
tend to be those whose goods have to be researched, marketed, and
distributed globally, for whom economies of scale are vital.
For them, every piece of software acquired, whether developed in-house or
bought in as a package, is an investment which has to be maximised by
integration across national borders. (See Citibank report, page six). It is
difficult enough to select the 'right solution' for one country, let alone a
dozen. A constant theme of Software At Work stories is the 'ownership' of
systems and the wooing and consultation of users in their implementation.
Add national considerations and regulations, and the problem escalates. Even
if the package supplier has built in multi-currency and multi-lingual
features, there are still such problems as price negotiations and support.
Pricing can be a constant headache, with currency changes and complications
of distribution. ECsoft, a multinational supplier of software tools and
consultancy, claims to be the only supplier to have cracked this problem
with a single price list in ECUs, and a single licence agreement for all its
products.
International co-ordination
Dr Peter Maier is the managing director of Sony Europa, with headquarters in
Germany. In previous jobs he had grappled with worldwide management issues,
and for Sony he is now responsible for pan-European corporate planning and
control, as well as for information systems serving a company with 13,500
employees and a DM15bn turnover.
'Sony started to think about pan-European management as an issue about four
years ago,' he explains. 'The business concept of harmonising information
technology in Europe means that we have to look at issues both as a user and
a supplier of software.'
He uses the term 'local globalisation' to describe the process by which
standard software is adapted. The responsibility for this lies with Sony
European Computer Services, based in Dusseldorf, and made up of 100 IT staff
of different European nationalities.
Co-ordination of software purchasing rests in the Dusseldorf HQ, which
effectively becomes an assessor of various European packages. A pan-European
conference dedicated to accounting gives staff the chance to 'audit' strong
and weak features, including multi-currency, and VAT. For accounting
(usually the first multi-national system to be considered), Sony chose D&amp;B
software, formerly the McCormack and Dodge accounting package, largely
because all the groundwork on national features was already there.
Some aspects simply cannot be managed by the package route, partly because
they rely on interpreting or linking existing systems. Sony, for instance,
has built its own Executive Information System (EIS).
'Whatever we do, it must pay respect to the national culture,' comments Dr
Maier. 'We have to tailor, modify, change colour and flavour. For instance,
we standardise only as necessary: we have to know the price of something but
don't care how it appears.'
Good management means help, not control, to Dr Maier - 'the headquarters
which can't provide a professional software service will die. It is
two-thirds help, and one-third control. That ultimately enables the
organisation to develop.'
Languages
As an increasing number of companies take an international view of software
procurement, most major software developers have had to stay one step ahead,
providing different language versions as well as catering for 'national'
features.
Nearly all software developments in the last few years have taken this into
account, by separating the text that appears on screen from the actual code.
This enables vendors in each country to translate most of the essentials
(such as screen prompts and error messages), although quirks of language and
keyboards still have to be overcome.
Computer translation is becoming more practical, although companies such as
Berlitz offer a more conventional route to translation. (UK consultancy Ovum
has recently surveyed the tools available for 'natural translation' of
products, and looked at the use of different languages in pan-European
offices.)
US companies have had a 'level playing field' at home on which to promote
their products and find a user base. But in entering Europe, they have had
to translate and adapt.
Electronic mail supplier Verimation, for example, now supplies its Memo
software in 12 languages, and provides pan-European support. DEC's
All-in-One integrated office system was translated into 12 different Local
Language Versions, but since 1988 has relied on a single international code
base, from which all country or language versions derive.
Microcom, a supplier of PC remote-control utilities, unable to set up
individual offices for marketing and support, relies on local translation
and distribution services. But these can hold snags, particularly where
high-tech translators are thin on the ground: 'remote control' was once
translated as a TV flip-channel gadget rather than as a remote access
function. This highlights the need, stressed by Ovum and others, to use
native speakers for translation.
Regulations and culture
UK software suppliers can no longer be insular, particularly in the area of
accounting. They are likely to find their packages assessed alongside
offerings which originated in Germany (such as SAP) or Scala, from Sweden,
which supports 30 different currencies and supports up to 20 languages
simultaneously.
Coda, Tetra, Financial Solutions, Kewill, Edwards and Systems Union are
among the UK companies who have risen to the challenge, and an increasing
number of their installations cross national boundaries. Although it is
comforting to know that steps are being taken to promote harmonisation,
there is a limited amount of practical help available from European
'self-help groups' such as the EC's European Software and Systems
Initiative, (ESSI) or the Eureka Software Factory Forum (a group dedicated
to creating European software tools).
For the most part, developers have to explore the rules and regulations for
themselves, and be alert to every new change of regulation. This makes it
all the more essential to have a flexible base to the package, allowing
tailoring, parameterisation, and extensions.
Without this, the cost of maintenance, borne by suppliers and passed on to
users, becomes intolerable.
Suppliers of accounting packages are in the front line in Europeanisation.
Having grappled with the rules themselves to incorporate various required
features in their packages, they are in a good position to guide and educate
their user-base.
D&amp;B Software, for instance, is alerting its users to the new VAT regulations
with a folder of information which brings together all the new requirements,
including new fields and codes.
Yorkshire-based Coda sells its multi-lingual, multi-company accounting
systems, based on IBM's AS400 minicomputer, to national and multi-national
companies. Increasingly, it looks to Europe for new sales, and has tailored
its software accordingly.
'Firstly, there are cosmetic differences in the way we record even the most
basic data,' says Coda's managing director, Rodney Potts.
'Everybody knows that Belgian francs and Italian lire are recorded without
decimals.
'Lire require larger value fields, and - outside the UK - the decimal
separator is a comma. VAT is handled differently, too: for instance, Belgian
VAT reports require a special modulus 11 check built into the account
coding, while VAT accounting in Italy and Spain have substantially different
implications to other EC countries.'
But, he points out, there are also deep-seated cultural differences in
European nations, rooted in historical factors. These explain, for example,
the German emphasis on cost-accounting and the French habit of settling by
cheque.
Over the years, Coda has been building such national characteristics into
its IAS suite.
Another UK accounting house, Tetra, has essentially made a fresh start with
its new Chameleon 2000 system. Julian Blomfield, who has waded through yards
of paperwork to make Chameleon European, picks up on the cultural point made
by Mr Potts.
'You can write software to do anything if you pay enough, but it's a matter
of convincing people to make the change. No matter how much legislation
there is, you've still got to get people to work together.'
Tetra uses the Informix database as its flexible base, the aim being to
incorporate into the core all the 'customised' national functions. The
company recognises that the resellers will have an important role in guiding
users through the complexities of an all-embracing package.
'A lot of end users may be looking to their local reseller,' predicts Mr
Blomfield. 'They may well take on the role of consultants in helping users
organise the way they use the software.'

Market: see panel on the next page.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (2): The
information imperative - Comment Today's technology now gives managers the
ability to choose the exact level of business information they need - but
without the right training, this crucial selection process may prove
difficult and lead to data overload
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time, perhaps, since the beginning of the modern computer era,
business people have the opportunity to make information their servant,
rather than their master.
The reasons for this profound shift in the business paradigm are to do with
improvements in technology: with the growth of distributed computing
systems, client-server architectures and object-orientated programming - all
topics that have been dealt with in recent issues of Software at Work.
Making the most of the opportunity will mean that, also for the first time,
executives will have to take the responsibility for choosing and defining
their information requirements.
Peter Drucker, doyen among management experts, recently told a seminar that
people at every level must develop information responsibility: 'They must
ask themselves what information they need to do their job, when, from whom
and in what form, and what information they owe to other people.
'The right answer is not 'as much as possible,' but 'as little as possible'
 -only what I need, because otherwise I cannot digest it,' Drucker argued.
Executives, however, may find it hard to decide on the information that is
most important for their job. They have become used to the systems
department dictating what information they can have and when. Staff will
have to be trained to define their information needs.
Early attempts to give senior managers information at their fingertips
failed for a variety of reasons; the inflexibility of the systems and a
reluctance among top managers to use keyboards put paid to early 'executive
information systems,' (EIS).
Robert Cringely, a US industry observer, notes in his gossipy book
Accidental Empires: 'The idea was that the Big Boss would be able to look
into the bowels of the company and know instantly how many widgets were
being produced in the Muncie plant . . . but American business executives
didn't know how to type and didn't want to learn.'
Those who did develop keyboard skills, however, were hardly able to roam at
will through the thousands of megabytes of information which constituted
their company files. Essentially, those early systems provided an electronic
slide show; a way of looking at information, carefully prepared by data
processing staff. In many companies it became a computerised version of the
'Blue Book' (or Red Book or Green Book), the collection of key business
statistics, updated monthly.
The electronic version might be updated minute by minute and it might allow
its users to 'drill down' through layers of data to investigate exceptions
and anomalies, but it remained essentially a static record, prepared in
advance. Free-ranging enquiries were simply not possible.
Professor Enid Mumford, one of the UK's leading computing academics,
outlined the problem in a recent paper: 'Developers tend to assume that all
managers have the same needs and this belief can turn EIS into information
straight-jackets, instead of providers of relevant data. The attempt to
provide 'general solutions' has failed because all companies do not have the
same business problems. Also the complexity of today's business environment
means that problems are becoming more different, rather than more similar,
even in the same industry.'
The term EIS, in any case, is looking dated. First, because it is now
appreciated that it is not only 'executives' who need access to corporate
data, but employees at every level of the organisation. Second, because
there should be no need of a special system to provide information of the
right quality.
As John Kavanagh illustrates in his articles on personnel systems in this
issue of Software at Work, substantial efficiencies and economies should
flow from any properly designed management information systems. Designing a
system properly, however, is a big challenge. Professor Mumford - best-known
for her research on the ways in which humans interact with computer systems
 -has an interest to declare because she is now commercially associated with
an innovative new management information technology, but her criticism of
the inflexibility of earlier EIS systems is well taken.
As this issue makes clear, the personnel area is one where software packages
have been designed to allow personnel people to define the information they
want. Generally, however, managers tend to identify the data they used most
recently; or they concentrate on the information used by their own
department ignoring the wider needs of the company.
Her solution involves a combination of group discussions and with a
cybernetic model derived from the work of Professor Stafford Beer designed
for the analysis of managers' roles and responsibilities.
The model provides the basis for the group discussion through which managers
agree the problems they wish to address - and the information needed to
address them. Professor Mumford's approach may not suit every company, but
it is an important step in the right direction. Instead of bombarding
everyone with everything, it is important to provide the right information
to the people who need it.

Has the fate of Punch, once Britain's best-known humorous magazine, been
ordained?
United Newspapers - which owns the title - has been trying to contact Bill
Tidy, a veteran cartoonist who lodged a bid for it at the end of August. He
has joined forces with Canadian physician John Cocker who is publisher of
the unlikely-sounding magazine Punch Digest for Canadian Doctors.
But with an irony worthy of the old organ, Tidy himself is away in Gibraltar
until next Tuesday. Still, Punch, which ceased publication in April, has
been around for 150 years. So it can probably wait a couple of days more for
resurrection from limbo.

The Ottoman Sultans must be whirling in their graves. Seventy years after
the end of the Turkish Empire, it seems that American pop singer Michael
Jackson is scheming to assume their long vacant, 400-year-old throne in the
Topkap Palace.
Worse still for the imperial dignity, if Jackson sits down as planned on the
seat of Suleyman the Magnificent and Selim the Sot on Saturday, he will be
brandishing a profane Pepsi-Cola bottle.
The Turkish public is still mulling over the idea which, needless to say,
was dreamed up by a pr company as part of Jackson's concert tour of Turkey.
Officialdom, in particular, is believed to be sharply split in its
attitudes. On the one hand are those taking a dim view of the whole thing.
On the other are those who think that a film clip of Jackson on the Ottoman
throne amid dancers and sax players, would be an unmissable opportunity to
introduce Turkey's culture to the rest of the world.

Called on to justify the superior attitude they take to dog-owners,
cat-lovers are apt to say their pets are more individual in character. Not
so, however, according to marketing consultant Freddie Marsh, who has sent
in a glossary of dog and cat noises in pet-food advertisements around the
world.
Dogs of different nations vary markedly in their tongues. The Woof-woof of
the British, for instance, must seem like Greek to the Spanish who say
Bup-bup, let alone to the Ao-ao-saying Portuguese. And surely none of the
Europeans could make head or tail of their Indonesian counterpart's
Gong-gong.
Cats, on the other hand, express themselves everywhere with a close
approximation to Miaow. Admittedly the glossary has Czechoslovakia's cats
emitting a marginally eccentric Nnou. But a call to the Czech embassy
established that what they really say is Mnou.

Pity the MPs on the House of Commons Social Security Committee, chaired by
Frank Field, as they wade through the enormous amount of technical
information thrown up in their investigation on behalf of the aggrieved
Maxwell pensioners.
What they really need is an accountant to help them interpret all the
figures and ask the right questions of those summoned into their presence.
They could also use some assistance with the answers.
The only problem is that among those being summoned are many firms of
accountants. Indeed, after excluding the auditors and advisers to the
Maxwell empire before its collapse, the administrators, receivers,
liquidators and bankruptcy trustees following in its wake, and those on
secondment to the Serious Fraud Office, there's barely a single firm left
which doesn't have a conflict of interest.

Can anyone remember the last time the chairman of a big international bank
and a bunch of his non-executive board chums resigned because they had let
the side down?
True, career bankers sometimes get the chop for making too many dud loans or
overspending on acquisitions. But it is almost unthinkable for bigwig
non-executive directors to take the rap as well.
Hence the rarity of the boardroom exodus at Australia's troubled Westpac
Banking Corporation. Chairman Sir Eric Neal, and four other members of the
antipodean corporate establishment, have handed in their notice. Many of
Westpac's problems can be blamed on bad management, but they occurred during
the departing board's watch. So the five have done the honourable thing.
What a pity that similarly placed non-executive directors of big London
clearers or New York money centre banks are so reluctant to follow the
Australian example.

Major has started making peace with Germany, and has stuck his neck out over
Maastricht
The question of the hour is not: 'Will Mr Norman Lamont resign?' It is:
'Will Mr John Major recover his authority?' Last night he began to make the
attempt. He announced that the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty will
return to the Commons, where it awaits a hostile reception from Conservative
Europhobes. It is a start, but the prime minister has much more to do. He
must learn to talk less like a party fixer and more like a national leader -
and he had better think about reshuffling his cabinet.
The chancellor's survival in an office whose duties he can no longer
properly fulfil suggests that Mr Major is more nervous about the political
consequences of letting him go than he is of what might happen to the
economy if he keeps him on. A Lamont departure right now might look like an
admission of guilt, an acknowledgement that it was the British government's
ineptitude, and not careless comments by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
president of the Bundesbank, that led to the collapse of sterling on
September 16. In the perfervid atmosphere of Downing Street the golden rule
is: never admit that you were wrong, not even slightly.
The government's initially schoolboyish reaction to the publication of Mr
Schlesinger's celebrated note is, however, only one explanation for Mr
Lamont's nine lives. The fragile condition of the Conservative party is
another. Mr Major is deeply unwilling to disturb the political balance of
his administration. This was made clear last week, when he plucked the
inoffensive Mr Peter Brooke out of retirement and put him in to succeed Mr
David Mellor at the Ministry of National Heritage. Poor Mr Brooke. A good
soldier in his time, he has done nothing to deserve being forced to share
the agony.
That little decision was, however, merely embarrassing. The appointment of a
new chancellor would be serious. It would constitute a political statement.
It would indicate whether the government was moving backwards, forwards or
sideways on the exchange rate mechanism and the management of the economy.
That would not be all loss. It would at least suggest that the government
knew whether it was moving backwards, forwards or sideways. Alas, the prime
minister is evidently not ready to make any such statement.
He should not be so cautious. He must know that he is secure enough. No
challenger for his job has stepped forward. Even if next week's Conservative
party conference is as dismal an affair as it currently threatens to be, he
occupies a position from which he can rebuild his reputation. He is, after
all, only a few months into what could still be a five-year term. The only
discernible medium-term threat to his tenure is a hypothetical rebellion of
his own backbenchers of a size sufficient to shame him out of office. That
could take place if the Maastricht bill was brought back to the House
without adequate preparation, but the Whip in Mr Major will surely prevail.
These are, however, picayune considerations. Both as prime minister and as
current president of the European Community Mr Major has to rebuild his
reputation piece by piece. Unfortunately for him, the pieces are scattered
across a continent. As he well knows, Britain is not an island; it is merely
surrounded by water. What Chancellor Kohl, President Mitterrand or Mr
Schlesinger say or do is as much a part of British political life as the
pronouncements or actions of an English cabinet minister, or a Scottish
leader of the opposition. What British politicians say at home must be the
same as what they say when abroad, and vice versa.
In short, a British prime minister has to conduct himself as a European
statesman at all times. If he does not, he will be crunched between the
demands of Europe and the demands of his local electorate. Mr Major must
therefore always speak and act like a European. That is his only option if
he is to serve his country's national interests.
At yesterday's cabinet meeting it was quickly realised that, as a first
step, he must make peace with the German government and the Bundesbank. The
new friendly approach was adopted by the prime minister in TV interviews
last night. It is to be hoped that every member of the cabinet has been
invited to take the oath of consistency. (Mr Lamont should be the exception.
On this matter an oath of silence would be best.)
As a second step, Mr Major has begun to undertake a task for which he is by
temperament unsuited. He is making a stand within his own party. Not in the
centre of the road (where, one of his colleagues recently remarked, he
attracts bullets from both sides), but at the head of one of the two warring
Tory factions. His choice could only be the so-called 'pro-Europeans'. To go
the other way would be to disown everything he has said since coming to
prominence. In short, Mr Major must now take on the Europhobes, the
disgruntled Thatcher-worshippers, and disarm them.
He might protest that he signalled his intentions in the House of Commons
last week. But his presentation was so weak, and the declarations so hedged
about with prevarication and placatory sentiments, that it was to no avail.
He is still wriggling out of any commitment to rejoin the exchange rate
mechanism. That is his offering to the right, and a negation of Maastricht.
His firmness of purpose is not absolute. It could never be. He is a
technocratic salesman. He looks for deals. He seeks to accommodate various
points of view. The method is often superficially effective, but on big
issues it is a weakness.
One of his strengths is that he is persistent. Last night he said flatly
that he would bring the Maastricht ratification bill back at the end of the
year. He may have done pencilled-in deals with the Danes, Germans, French
and Dutch, along the lines suggested by the foreign secretary yesterday. A
clause on subsidiarity and a statement of intent on how the Commission and
the Council of Ministers will work in future may be seen as the magic
solution. We must hope that all this does not reflect the salesman's natural
optimism.
Mr Major's patient methodology has achieved results in the past, and may
again this time. But those results have a price. Last year, after a period
during which he was accused of 'dither', Mr Major produced the council tax
to replace the poll tax. It did not take us straightforwardly back to
domestic property taxes, but contained some head-tax elements to win over
the recalcitrant right. It is beginning to look as if it will be a disaster
when it is introduced next year. A second long pragmatic period of
back-office work by Mr Major's civil servants and ministerial colleagues
produced the Maastricht deal. It is now having to be renegotiated.
If Mr Major is truly ambitious, there is no alternative to becoming a
national leader who points to the distant horizon and asks his supporters to
follow him. He must stand up unequivocally for Europe, for the early
ratification of Maastricht and for the eventual return of the pound to the
exchange rate mechanism, and shape his cabinet accordingly. If he does so,
he certainly risks defeat. It is, however, his best chance. Next week in
Brighton we will see if he takes it further than he did last night.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Letter: Major and government should resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTIAN DUMMETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Never before has a UK government so blatantly misled its own people,
world financial markets and, most horrifically, the European Community over
which it presides, as during the build-up to the latest devaluation of
sterling. John Major and his government should resign and call a general
election.
By its own admission, the Conservative party alone is the party that
understands financial markets and believes in the unrestricted movement of
capital and the merits of free trade. And, by that, it confesses to knowing
how large a run on the pound could be.
In case one were tempted to forgive the chancellor a certain amount of
ignorance, one might care to remember that, a week prior to our voluntary
suspension from the ERM, Finland, Sweden and, above all, Italy witnessed
colossal currency flows that savaged their financial markets. So Messrs
Major and Lamont knew exactly what they would be faced with and were not
prepared to do everything necessary to defend the pound.
If they had been prepared, they would have followed the Bundesbank in
raising rates half a point earlier in the year. Failing that, they would
have raised rates when their ERM Ecu divergence indicator went through the
critical - 75 level. Finally, they would have hiked rates 50 basis points on
the morning following the lira devaluation, when the Germans wrong-footed
the markets by shaving the Lombard rate a mere quarter of a point.
But the government never had any intention of raising rates for an
indefinite period to protect the pound. Not once did Mr Major or Mr Lamont
say he would raise rates.
This government could not bear a painful rise in mortgage repayments and so
a last-ditch 'we-tried-everything' strategy was hatched. The plan was to
defend the pound with borrowed money and to jack up rates as a last resort,
knowing full well that responsible home-loan lenders would not follow suit.
Unfortunately, when faced with death, there is no distinction between
bravery and fear. When this government realised that the final nail was
about to be hammered into the coffin of its economic policy, it pretended to
go down with a spirited fight.
There has been much talk of speculators during this sad affair, but it is
unlikely they played much part in the downfall of our currency. Aware of the
government's lack of will power, fund managers, corporate treasurers and
foreign investors lost faith in them and more crucially in the pound.
The only speculators on the horizon were a beleaguered Bank of England and a
humiliated UK government. John Major should now resign.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Letter: Nigeria fully committed to Opec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TAIWO IDEMUDIA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Neil Buckley ('Once again Opec shoots itself in the foot', Commodities
and Agriculture, September 22) refers to a suggestion by Mr Vahan Zanoyan
that 'larger producers such as Nigeria and Venezuela might also be tempted
to follow Ecuador' ostensibly out of Opec. This could not be further from
the truth.
Nigeria does not see itself as a 'weak and uninfluential member of Opec who
just turns up, takes a lot of abuse from the Gulf countries and goes home'.
Having provided the Opec conference president for 11 of the last 15 terms,
Nigeria has played a leadership role.
The Nigerian minister of petroleum and mineral resources, Dr Chu S P
Okongwu, stresses that Nigeria remains fully committed to Opec, its
objectives and its strategies. He says that at no time did Nigeria consider
changing its status within Opec, much less withdrawing. Taiwo Idemudia,

FT  02 OCT 92 / Letter: V-2 rocket pioneers guided by space-age dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr H. KROMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Why are the British furious about the commemoration of the V-2 rocket?
To me, they seem to have lost the ability to take an unbiased view of that
fantastic technological breakthrough.
I am proud of the fact that inventors and engineers from my country opened
the gate to space technology and the landing on the moon. As early as the
1930s the ingenious Dr Werner von Braun dreamt of the space age and - to put
it bluntly - the V-2 was an aunt of the famous Saturn V b.
Those pioneers were guided by space enthusiasm and not by the idea of
bombing the British capital.
I think you would have to concede that Sir Arthur Harris did not have that
dream when he was bombing women and children in Dresden.

Sir, Who are these 'speculators' that everyone has started whingeing about?
Are they the young men in shirt-sleeves doing a job of work for the leading
banks, to provide the markets without which British industry would
suffocate?
Or are they the Treasury officials spending vast sums in an attempt to force
those markets to move against their natural tendency - an outrageous gamble
against the odds?

   From Mr MICHAEL A KEELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Must we continue to endure the nonsense of hearing politicians and
commentators describe currency fluctuations in terms of perverse speculators
who undermine policies of virtuous governments and mount bloodthirsty
attacks on weak currencies?
Traders deal to make money or avoid losses, not to make expensive political
points. It makes sense to sell a currency down to the level indicated by the
fundamentals, but dealers have no incentive to sell below this point.
Equally, pension funds and other investment institutions would be risking
justified criticism if they failed to get out of currencies which appeared
overvalued on the fundamentals. They have no patriotic duty to incur losses
to maintain the currency at a particular level.
Politicians who are fond of extolling the virtues of the free market are
often less than enthusiastic when market forces deliver results which are
not to their liking. Traders then become 'speculators' and enterprise
becomes 'greed'.
The French finance minister has even reminded us of the dire fate of
speculators during the revolution. He would be better advised to threaten
the return of the guillotine for supporters of such market distortions as
the CAP.
Until a single currency becomes economically and politically feasible,
markets should be allowed to do their job. Vive the marche libre]

FT  02 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines on rise in
jobless insurance claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices fell across the board yesterday on more bad economic news,
despite a sharp bond market rally writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 17.29 at 3,254.37.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 1.50 at 416.30,
while the Amex composite closed 1.91 lower at 374.81 and the Nasdaq
composite 4.94 lower at 578.33. NYSE turnover was 205m shares, and declines
outpaced rises by 1000 to 721.
After a modest early gain, shares took flight on a 15,000 rise in weekly
state unemployment insurance claims.
Analysts had been expecting a small decline in claims and the data
immediately sparked speculation that today's employment report for September
would show another big fall in non-farm payrolls.
Although this might prompt another cut in interest rates, investors
yesterday chose to focus on the implications of the recent data for economic
and corporate earnings growth. They also ignored the big rise in bond
prices, which had been sparked by the jobs claims data.
The day's other piece of gloomy economic news was a sharp drop in the
National Association of Purchasing Managers' September index, which fell
from 53.7 to 49.0. Any figure below 50 is regarded as an indication that
manufacturing business is contracting.
Among individual stocks, Pennzoil jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 55 1/4 as
investors reacted positively to Wednesday's late news that the company plans
to swap 48 per cent of its Dollars 2.2bn stake in Chevron for some of
Chevron's US oil and gas reserves. Chevron was also higher, up Dollars  3/8
at Dollars 74 1/2 .
Medical Care America plunged Dollars 37 1/8 to Dollars 20 3/8 in turnover of
4.4m shares after the company said it was being sued by stockholders for
making allegedly misleading comments about its revenue and earnings
prospects.
Another big loser was Glenfed, which dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 1 3/8 on a
warning that a cash squeeze could force the company to seek bankruptcy
protection over the next six months.
Coleman rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 after the company said it
expected third-quarter profits to exceed the 8 cents a share it earned at
the same stage a year ago and revenues to top last year's third-quarter
total of Dollars 82.7m.
On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 28
1/2 in turnover of 3.5m shares after analysts at broking houses Morgan
Stanley and Goldman Sachs lowered their estimates for the company's
first-quarter net income to 15 cents a share.
Software Publishing fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 7 3/4 after the company
said that it will cut its workforce by 15 per cent in a restructuring
programme which could cost as much as Dollars 14m.
Canada
TORONTO posted its fifth consecutive loss in active trading, the TSE 300
composite index falling 22.84 to 3,275.04 in volume of 30.36m shares valued
at CDollars 355.9m. Declines led advances by 310 to 201.
Dealers said that equities, by now, might have reflected most of the
uncertainty surrounding Canada's referendum on the constitution on October
26.
Carena Developments and Hees International Bancorp said a private investor
had recently bought 50 per cent of Battery Park Holdings from the Reichmann
family, principals in Olympia &amp; York Developments. Carena owns the other
half. Carena fell 45 cents to CDollars 4.05 in light trading. Hees, which
owns 23 per cent of Carena, fell CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 11 7/8 .

lost 10 at 892. Property shares were active as institutional investors
switched to the sector to take advantage of high yields.

FT  02 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Kuwait falls as expected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT, which reopened on Monday following a two year closure forced by the
Iraqi invasion, closed its week apparently 22.4 per cent down on a temporary
index set up by an independent company; but the fall came within pre-opening
predictions, agencies report.
Alshal Economic Consultants said yesterday that its provisional 'Alshal
Index' for the period measured the value of stocks between August 1, 1990 -
the last trading day before the August 2 Iraqi invasion - and the last
trading day of each week.
The index closed at 77.6, down 22.4. Volume during the three days was 2.89m
shares valued at 1.21m Kuwaiti dinars (Dollars 4.14m) for an average of
963,000 shares, and 403,000 dinars a day.
Initial trading was limited and local observers said that trading was
cautious because of the weakness of the economy, which had led to
preductions of a 25 per cent fall in the market before it reopened.

FT  02 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Troubled background for Buba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTACK on currency speculation came from the Irish finance minister; one
on the Bundesbank from Spain after its credit rating was placed under
review; borrowing plans to shore up the Italian economy were promulgated;
and the focus of currency speculation turned back to sterling again.
All this formed a troubled background to German speculation that the
Bundesbank will cut rates again after its council meeting today, writes Our
Markets Staff. Dealers there expect squalls if the rate cut does not happen.
FRANKFURT, meanwhile, picked up on the speculation and the rise in bunds to
close with the DAX index 17.67 higher at 1,484.03, although German market
turnover was still said to be thin.
Bank shares made the most of the story, Deutsche Bank gaining DM7.50 marks
at DM640.50, Commerzbank, helped by UK orders, DM9 to DM239 and Dresdner
Bank DM8.50 to DM351.
Elsewhere, carmakers regained lost ground. Volkswagen, which fell sharply
earlier this week after a news magazine forecast heavy operating losses for
1992, recovered DM6.70 to DM281.90; BMW rose DM5.50 to DM471 and Daimler
added DM6 at DM564.50.
MADRID suffered further as Moody's, the US credit ratings agency, said that
it was reviewing the rating of Spain's foreign currency debt. The general
index closed down 6.94 at 186.01 while the Ibex was 3.7 per cent lower.
Since the devaluation of the peseta the market has been weakening with fears
that there may have to be a further cut to increase the competitiveness of
the economy. Utilities have come under pressure because of the extent of
their exposure to foreign currency debt. Yesterday Fecsa was Pta59 weaker at
Pta524 and Sevillana lost Pta21 to Pta394.
Mr Victor Galliano, analyst at Baring Securities in London, commented that
there was likely to be some bargain-hunting as the general index enters the
180 level but that 'as long as the currency remains vulnerable one will see
no support from foreign institutions'.
PARIS fell on some disappointing interim results with the CAC-40 index
shedding 12.73 to 1,724.00 in turnover of FFr2.09bn.
Pernod Ricard lost more than 9 per cent following the release after
Wednesday's close of half year earnings which came in at the lower end of
expectations. The drinks group also forecast that net profit growth will be
limited to 6 per cent for the full year, due to fluctuations on foreign
exchange markets and a decline in domestic sales. The shares lost FFr38.00
or 8.45 per cent to FFr411.50.
Alcatel Alsthom was another loser on the day following poor interim figures.
The telecoms and engineering group closed FFr6 lower at FFr626.
Peugeot lost ground ahead of results which came out just after the close,
ending down FFr20 or 3.6 per cent at FFr524. Eurotunnel went against the
trend on Wednesday's news that it had been successful in an arbitration case
against Transmanche Link. It closed up 30 centimes at FFr36.70.
ZURICH tapped into the German interest rate speculation and this, together
with a decline in Swiss interest rates late in the session, left the SMI
index 6.9 higher at 1,885.2.
Banks reflected the theme, SBC registered rising SFr3 to SFr268. On
Wednesday, Salomon Brothers said that SBC was inexpensive; a hedge against
the dollar's weakness; and a beneficiary of lower European interest rates.
AMSTERDAM featured a new all time low of Fl 12.60 in DAF, ahead of a brief
suspension as the truck maker clarified its financial position. The group
said that it was near to agreeing a Fl 210m loan from banks, and closed Fl
2.00 down at Fl 13.20.
The CBS Tendency index lost 0.4 to 110.5. KLM recovered after denying
reports that it planned further cost cuts and the shares lost Fl 1.70 to Fl
25.90.
MILAN tried to rally on the government's final approval of a L93,000bn
package of budget cuts for 1993, but a sharp fall in Montedison weighed upon
the market, where the Comit index closed 0.54 lower at 363.10.
Montedison's move from profit to loss in the first half of 1992 left the
shares L69, or 6 per cent down at an official close of L1,076, and another
L36 lower at L1,040 on the kerb. Ferruzzi Finanziaria, which controls
Montedison, dropped 9.3 per cent to L1,038.
Generali moved against the trend, gaining L320 at L25,150 on strong foreign
buying interest; and the retailer, Rinascente, put on 5.8 per cent to L3,739
on speculation that it might be sold by the Agnelli group to finance the
Fiat expansion programme.
COPENHAGEN firmed again, writes Hilary Barnes, led by industrials and
shipping shares as the all-share index rose by 1.55 to 64.34. Novo Nordisk
put on DKr6 to close at DKr518, Danisco was ahead by DKr13 to Dkr628, and
Baltica continued Wednesday's recovery with a rise of DKr15 to DKr230.
Codan, the insurance company among potential contenders to take over the
insurance divisions of the collapsed Hafnia group, fell DKr150 to DKr3,700.
OSLO majored on shipping, the sector index rising by 4.85 per cent to 285.20
with Bergesen B NKr5 higher at 80.5. The all-share index rose 8.74 points,
or 2.65 per cent to 338.62 in active trading worth NKr329.6m. In HELSINKI,
the bank and finance company index jumped 11.85 as the Hex rose 14.2, or 2.3
per cent to 625.8.

FT  02 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei registers its
fifth consecutive loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices closed marginally lower as buying by public insurance and
pension funds countered profit-taking and arbitrage-linked selling, writes
Emiko Terazono.
The Nikkei average fell 29.17 to 17,369.91, falling for the fifth
consecutive day. The index rose on small-lot buying in the morning session,
rising to the day's high of 17,554.56 before falling to the low of 17,104.21
in the afternoon as a decline in the futures market prompted arbitrage
unwinding.
Volume firmed to 320m shares against 288m. Declines led advances by 672 to
297 with 129 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
lost 6.17 to 1,304.43 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.41 to
1042.16.
Buying by public funds remained small, while foreigners were seen taking
profits as a consequence of the higher yen. The currency weakened slightly
against the dollar, easing pessimism over the effects on company profits of
leading exporters, and the overall Japanese economy.
Investors targeted issues unaffected by currency rate fluctuations. Food
shares firmed, with Ajinomoto gaining Y10 to Y1,320 and Takara Shuzo adding
Y35 to Y720.
High-technology issues, which were sold off on concerns over lower profits
due to the rise in the yen, rose on small-lot bargain hunting. Hitachi
gained Y3 to Y730 and Toshiba advanced Y16 to Y570.
NEC, however, fell Y17 to Y680. Traders said that worries over the effects
of sales of cheaper personal computers by Compaq, the US computer maker, in
Japan, depressed the issue. NTT slipped Y20,000 to Y540,000. Investors were
discouraged by reports that the company will postpone an increase in
telephone rates.
Short term speculative issues remained active. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the
most active issue of the day, fell Y5 to Y505. In Osaka, the OSE average
fell 249.19 to 18,768.41 in volume of 17.6m shares.
Roundup
THE region remained mixed yesterday.
HONG KONG was firmer on a technical rebound, traders said. The Hang Seng
index closed up 23.4 at 5,528.84. Unconfirmed Japanese newspaper reports
that the hardline Chinese communist leader, Chen Yun, was seriously ill were
used as an excuse to buy after a weaker opening.
AUSTRALIA closed at an 18-month low although late bargain hunting helped the
market off its intraday worst. The All Ordinaries index closed 12.9 down at
1,472.1 in turnover of ADollars 207.2m.
Westpac gained 1 cent to ADollars 2.86 on bargain hunting; this followed the
resignation of directors after the bank's first half losses of ADollars
1.67bn and its undersubscribed rights issue.
BANGKOK was lifted by strong gains in bank, finance and property shares. The
SET index gained 12.68 or 1.49 per cent at 859.68 in turnover of Bt12.7bn.
Krisda Mahanakorn, the property group, which has fallen sharply over the
previous three days, hit its 10 per cent upward limit with a gain of Bt17 to
Bt187.
NEW ZEALAND lost 1.6 per cent on weakness in the forestry sector. The
NZSE-40 index ended down 22.54 at 1,406.91 as Fletcher Challenge shed 4
cents to NZDollars 1.83 and Carter Holt Harvey fell 12 cents to NZDollars
2.45.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its losses as the composite index dipped below the key
600-point level, closing down 4.18 at 598.10. Brokers said that investors
remained cautious ahead of the Malaysian budget due later this month.
SEOUL fell for the fifth consecutive session but in low turnover. The index
lost 5.06 to 508.76 in turnover of Won82.6bn.
MANILA was helped to a stronger close on foreign buying of selected blue
chips. The composite index gained 13.57 to 1,418.11 in turnover of 557m
pesos. PLDT gained 15 pesos to 995 pesos.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Hopes of rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SENTIMENT in the sterling cash and futures markets fell sharply yesterday
morning following revelations of a new row between the Bundesbank and the UK
Treasury over the sterling crisis.
However, the mood in all markets improved after the Bundesbank injected a
quick tender allotment of DM15.6bn into the German money market at a fixed
rate of 8.9 per cent.
The Bundesbank's last three liquidity injections have been at declining
rates of 9.2 per cent, 9.0 per cent, and 8.9 per cent, leading some traders
to think that there will be a cut in German short-term rates at the
Bundesbank's fortnightly council meeting today.
The disagreements between the Bundesbank and the UK Treasury underlined the
uncertainty about the future direction of UK economic policy. One discount
house director remained confident that there would be another cut in UK base
rates before the end of the month, possibly at the Conservative party
conference next week.
But the prime mover behind a base rate cut would be Mr Norman Lamont, the UK
chancellor, and his position may have been seriously undermined by the
latest turn in the Anglo-German row. A clearing bank dealer said yesterday
that the immediate aftermath of Mr Lamont's resignation would be a rise in
money market rates, because a new chancellor would be under pressure not to
show a lax view on rates in his first months in office.
The December short sterling contract opened 12 basis points lower at 91.68,
and dropped another 3 points to bottom out at 91.65 in the morning.
News of the German intervention brightened the market's mood and the
December contract closed at 91.88, 8 basis points up on the day. The
December contract on the French futures exchange closed 20 basis points up
at 90.70.
The Bank of England took most of the day to remove a shortage of Pounds
900m. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 65m of Band 1 bank
bills at 8 7/8 per cent. The Bank later purchased Pounds 7m of Band 1 bank
bills at 8 7/8 per cent, Pounds 32m in a repo at 8 15/16 per cent, Pounds
16m in Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 304m of Band 1 bank bills, and Pounds
4m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. Late assistance was Pounds 370m.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Anglo-German rift sinks pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING dropped nearly 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as foreign
exchange markets were thrown into confusion by a new rift between the UK
Treasury and the Bundesbank, writes James Blitz.
Since it was devalued two weeks ago, the pound has hovered weakly above
DM2.50 because of the apparent lack of an economic policy in the UK. The
emergence of a new fault-line in Anglo-German relations on Wednesday night
pushed the pound down to DM2.4770 in Asian trading, with the currency
bottoming out at DM2.4680 in Europe yesterday. It later closed at DM2.4750,
down 4 1/4 pfennigs on the day.
The unhappiness with sterling was well analysed by a currency manager at one
of the biggest UK investment funds. He said that sterling was now
undervalued against the D-Mark, but that purchasing power parities were no
longer influencing the market. 'Instead,' he said, 'our customers are
concerned that there is no official target for the sterling exchange rate.'
Until Wednesday's row surfaced, he had thought sterling could bottom out at
DM2.40. He now believed that it could go to DM2.30, adding that some of his
colleagues believed DM2.20 was not far fetched.
Two factors will influence the short-term outlook for the currency. The
first is whether Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, resigns. Mr Ian
Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros in London, said: 'I don't think that
Lamont is a plus for sterling. A plus for the pound would be someone with a
new mandate.'
Another factor is whether the Bundesbank cuts short-term rates today. A
generous injection of liquidity into the German money market at 8.9 per cent
yesterday, about 20 basis points below call money, raised new hopes of this.
The French franc and the peseta closed slightly easier against the D-Mark at
FFr3.38 and Pta70.42 respectively. But pressure on the peseta remains
strong, and a Bank of Spain official called for a review of EMS mechanisms
to counter capital flows.
Several analysts ruled out a rate change altogether, while some thought that
the differential between US and German rates could widen further if there is
a poor US non-farm payroll report today. The dollar rose more than a pfennig
yesterday on a mixture of short covering and optimism about the German money
market intervention, closing at DM1.4255 in London. But it remains nearly 6
pfennigs down on the week.
Even so, there was a feeling that the currency tensions may be over. 'The
market has already discounted the idea that the Federal Reserve has decided
to ease,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London.
'And there is some chance that the weaker ERM currencies will escape
devaluation,'

<TEXT>
IBM Japan, the Japanese subsidiary of the US computer group, yesterday
announced a corporate restructuring to increase the operational autonomy of
its marketing divisions.
The company said Mr Takeo Shiina, president, would become chairman and chief
executive, while Mr Kakutaro Kitashira, vice-president, would become
president in January.
Under the restructuring, IBM Japan's general business division, which is in
charge of marketing to middle-sized companies and personal users, becomes a
wholly-owned subsidiary with a separate profit and loss account.
The services business division becomes a subsidiary. Expanding services to
customers has become an important focus of IBM's efforts to grow in the
Japanese market.
The Japanese parent will be responsible for large corporate customers, for
IBM's Asia Pacific technical operation, and for general staff functions.
The moves follow the restructuring of IBM's worldwide operations to
decentralise group functions into independent business divisions and
subsidiaries.
IBM named Mr James Bartlett, formerly of Philips Electronics, to manage the
mobile computing business at IBM Personal Computer, the company established
a month ago to develop new products and services, Reuter reports.

<TEXT>
COMPAQ, the US personal computer company, yesterday launched a line of cheap
desktop computers in Japan in an effort to lift its almost negligible share
in the market.
The launch looked certain to accelerate the decline of PC prices in Japan,
which tend to be much higher than in the US or Europe. However, analysts
said Compaq's small presence in the market would mean the impact of its
lower prices would be slow to be felt.
The computers are almost identical to computers Compaq launched in the US in
June, and the prices in Japan only slightly higher.
The main difference is they will be equipped with the DOS/V operating system
which can accommodate Japanese language programmes as well as normal
IBM-compatible programmes. The computers are strikingly cheaper than similar
computers on the local market and will provide a test case of whether it is
possible to build market share in Japan on the basis of lower prices and
US-style marketing.
Compaq will, for example, be the first computer vendor to offer a toll-free
phone line to give advice to its customers.
The cheapest model, with an Intel i386sx microprocessor and 2 megabits of
active memory will sell for Y128,000 (Dollars 1,030), roughly half the
recommended price of a similarly-equipped computer from NEC, which supplies
over half of the Japanese market.
The actual difference in price will be smaller because high dealer margins
for an NEC machine leave room for bigger discounting.
Mr Masaru Murai, president of Compaq's Japanese subsidiary, said: 'I think
this will change the personal computer world in Japan and that is our
objective in this market. We are not here to introduce a price war. We are
here to expand the market.'
Compaq's main competitors in Japan, such as NEC Toshiba did not appear
worried by the competition. Mr Katsuichi Tomita, general manager of NEC's PC
marketing division, said NEC had in the past decade brought down the price
of computers and this would continue.
Mr Steven Myers, analyst at Jardine Flemming Securities, said: 'NEC will
have to make some response, but in all likelihood they will not have to
match Compaq's prices.'
Compaq has signed on more than 40 dealers, which have 500 to 600 shops. It
has contracts with two Japanese companies to provide on-site servicing.

1bn a year

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT PALMER, who yesterday took over at the helm of Digital Equipment,
the US computer manufacturer, said yesterday he intended to cut costs by
Dollars 1bn a year to restore the struggling company to profitability.
He said he would rationalise the company's product line, eliminate
redundancy in research and development and increase the pace at which the
company was reducing the size of its workforce.
'Reducing unnecessary expense is vital and we are looking at every expense,
whether large or small.'
Digital, once second only to International Business Machines among
international computer companies, has reported losses for the past two
fiscal years. For the 1992 financial year ended in June, the company
recorded losses of Dollars 2.7bn on sales of Dollars 7.7bn while in 1991
losses were Dollars 617m on sales of Dollars 8.3bn.
'The historically high profit margin on hardware and the business model upon
which Digital was built are no longer sustainable,' Mr Palmer said.
Digital has been hit hard by moves to smaller, less expensive computer
systems which command significantly lower gross profit margins than the
company's traditional minicomputer lines. It also failed to move quickly
enough into personal computers and open or industry standard systems.
Mr Palmer was speaking on his first day as president and chief executive,
the post he has taken over from Mr Kenneth Olsen, Digital's founder, who was
principally identified with the company's failure to keep pace with the new
structure of the industry.
Mr Palmer said: 'Digital is going to change. It will take time but we are
going to begin today. Digital will undergo a transformation.'
He said Digital would refocus its research and development spending.
'Our plan will be to reduce and re-allocate funds to support research and
development that satisfies customers and provides an appropriate level of
return. This will be a cultural change for Digital.'
There was overlap and redundancy within Digital's current product line, Mr
Palmer acknowledged.

<TEXT>
ENICHEM, the Italian state-owned chemicals concern which is one of Europe's
leading plastics producers, suffered a group loss of L721bn (Dollars 600m)
after minority interests in the first half of this year.
The result represents a marked deterioration in EniChem's performance,
caused by the continuing recession and severe price competition for many
plastics because of worldwide overcapacity.
In the first half of 1991, EniChem, now fully controlled by the Eni energy
and chemicals holding company, lost L245bn. However, that figure included
L224bn in extraordinary gains from the sale to other Eni companies of its
Praoil refining subsidiary.
EniChem, which should shortly receive a L1,000bn cash injection from Eni,
declined to give a profits forecast for the year. Officials indicated the
cash injection, combined with efforts to cut costs and improve productivity,
should contain this year's loss below L1,000bn.
At the operating level, EniChem's results deteriorated sharply, with a
L169bn first-half loss, against a L140bn profit in the first half of 1991.
However, the group said a better comparison was with the L217bn lost in the
second half of 1991 to show the effect of cost-saving measures.
The group said the workforce had been trimmed by over 3,000 people to 34,733
in the past 12 months. Further benefits would come from the co-operation
agreement and joint ventures signed with the UK's BP Chemicals earlier this
year. However, the financial advantages would only be seen in next year's
accounts.
Sales fell to L5,708bn in the first half, against L6,463bn last time.
However, this year's figure was in line with the L5,694bn turnover in the
second half of 1991.
EniChem's problem remains debts, which rose by 9.6 per cent to L7,677bn at
end-June from L7,000bn last December.

CONTINENTAL Airlines, a middle-ranking US carrier which has been operating
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since late 1990, has received yet
another investment proposal, this time from a group of former executives as
part of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (Esop).
The proposal - the fifth in recent months - comes only weeks after
Lufthansa, the German national carrier, filed a plan to acquire Continental
for Dollars 400m in partnership with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian
financier.
The latest offer of Dollars 25m in equity and Dollars 400m in Esop debt,
would leave employees with a 52 per cent stake in the reorganised company.
Creditors would get a 40 per cent tranche and the remainder would be held by
senior management and Benefits Concepts of New York, a firm which designs,
installs, administers and finances Esops.
Other bidders for Continental include an investor group headed by Mr Charles
Hurwitz, a Texas-based businessman, an offer from Mr Alfredo Bresner, whose
family owns a considerable stake in Mexicana Airlines, and an offer from Air
Canada with another Texan investment group.
The face value of these packages has risen steadily from Dollars 350m to the
latest Dollars 425m offer.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Reichmann family has sold a secret stake in New York's World
Financial Centre, acknowledging a hitherto undisclosed partnership between
themselves and a company controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman
family.
Evidence of the Reichmann-Bronfman partnership in a company called Battery
Park Holdings (BPH), which owns 35 per cent of the 7.6m sq ft World
Financial Centre, has sparked a furore in Canada and the US.
Authorities in Canada are investigating whether the investment by Carena
Developments, a Bronfman-controlled property holding company, in BPH,
violated stock exchange disclosure requirements. The investment is worth
USDollars 120m.
Another Bronfman company, Hees International Bancorp, provided a loan to
finance the Reichmanns' purchase of their 50 per cent stake in BPH.
Creditors of Olympia &amp; York, the Reichmann-owned real estate developer which
is under bankruptcy protection in Canada and the UK, have responded angrily
to the disclosure of the Reichmanns' stake in BPH.
The creditors have gone to considerable lengths to probe the extent of the
Reichmanns' business interests in order to generate as much cash as possible
for O&amp;Y.
Carena said yesterday the Reichmanns had sold their 50 per cent stake in BPH
to Mr Richard Shiff, a Toronto property investor. Terms were not disclosed,
but the company which holds Mr Shiff's stake in BPH still owes Dollars 120m
to Hees. Carena continues to own the other half of BPH.
The Reichmanns' only previously-announced link to the Bronfmans was the
shareholdings of O&amp;Y and Carena in Trizec, North America's biggest
publicly-traded real estate developer.
O&amp;Y's Trizec stake was reduced from 36 per cent to 25 per cent earlier this
year as a result of a share issue.
Mr Robert Harding, Hees's chief operating officer, insisted yesterday:
'We've done the right thing throughout.' He said Hees's and Carena's
dealings with the Reichmanns were subject to the same confidentiality
requirements as a banking relationship.
Carena earlier hoped that its investment in the World Financial Centre would
facilitate a restructuring of Trizec's complex ownership.
Discussions on this restructuring have been suspended since O&amp;Y's financial
problems surfaced. O&amp;Y's shares in Trizec form part of the collateral on its
CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 10.8bn) debt.

A rationalisation plan announced yesterday includes the sale of assets to

The company faces a squeeze in cash-flow as contract rates have fallen
sharply and flat prices have plummeted.
Jitters over Japan's property-related companies have shaken the Tokyo stock
market. However, government plans to set up organisation to buy land held as
collateral by banks, to revive the property market, had restored confidence.
Daikyo will transfer property assets to affiliates and sell Y50bn (Dollars

<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS has been forced to postpone plans to proceed with the
detailed implementation of its Dollars 750m (Pounds 430m) purchase of a 44
per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier.
Lord King, BA chairman, said the US government was reluctant to proceed
until the outcome and consequences of the US presidential election in
November became clear.
The UK ministry of transport said the next round of bilateral talks with its
US counterpart was scheduled between October 6 and October 9 in Washington.
The ministry said officials were expected to discuss access for US airlines
to UK regional airports.
Also on the agenda was the right of UK airlines to fly beyond US gateway
airports to other hubs. The issue of BA's links with USAir was clearly
related, it said.
A delay until after the election would compress the timetable for talks as
the agreement says that either party can pull out if the transaction is not
concluded by Christmas Eve.
Meanwhile, in Washington, US airline executives launched a campaign against
the British Airways-USAir deal.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, said the deal as it stood was
illegal because it gave BA control over every significant USAir decision.
Even if it were restructured to comply with US law banning foreign control
of US airlines, the US should still refuse permission.
Joined by Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, Mr Ronald
Allen, chairman of Delta Air Lines and Mr Frederick Smith, chairman and
chief executive of Federal Express, Mr Wolf said the deal would give BA
total access to the vast US air transport market while US carriers were
blocked from the UK and European markets. 'To allow this to happen would be
the worst mistake our government has ever made in air transportation,' Mr
Wolf said.
BA said: 'They've said it all before. It was the same bleating as before,
reinforcing our view that we have made a good deal.'
Meanwhile, Lord King said the prospect of buying a stake in Qantas, the
Australian state airline which is being privatised, was 'quite a good
prospect'.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Eastern eyes on Trafalgar's treasure chest: Andrew Taylor
and Roland Rudd explain the attraction of a debt-laden conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House is a debt-laden property developer boasting a ship with a
hole in it, hotels with empty rooms and a management reportedly at each
others' throats.
Its share price dropped by two thirds in five months, and - say critics -
its purchase last year of the Davy engineering business may have cost too
much.
So why is Hongkong Land buying a large minority stake?
The answer lies in the potential value locked away in Trafalgar's battered
treasure chest of famous names: Cunard, Ritz, Scott Lithgow, John Brown and
Davy.
Some of these businesses have lost their sparkle - and the QE2, Cunard's
most glamorous cruise liner, is under repair after running aground last
month. But if the businesses were sold separately, they might fetch more
than Trafalgar's market capitalisation of just over Pounds 600m.
This calculation, say observers, lies behind yesterday's dawn raid on
Trafalgar's shares by Hongkong Land, a sister company of Jardine Matheson,
one of the last of the traditional expatriate-run Hong Kong trading
companies.
In a matter of hours, Hongkong Land built up a stake of just under 15 per
cent in Trafalgar. It announced its intention of moving as soon as possible
to 29.9 per cent, the maximum permitted without triggering a full bid under
Takeover Panel rules.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, and Mr Henry Keswick, chairman
of Jardine Matheson, met Sir Nigel Broackes, Trafalgar's founder-chairman,
to tell him of their move.
Sir Nigel must have been half-expecting such a visit. The slide in
Trafalgar's share price before the raid had left the company conscious of
its vulnerability. It has been hinting that it might be prepared to sell its
hotel and shipping businesses - which include the QE2 and the Ritz - at the
right price.
That would leave management to concentrate on a core business of
construction and engineering, running alongside a shrunken property
operation.
Any benefit this news might have brought to the shares was promptly undone
by reports that the plan was setting Trafalgar's senior management at
loggerheads. Sir Nigel Broackes is said to have faced disagreement from his
chief executive Sir Eric Parker, who disliked the idea.
Now Hongkong Land has stepped in, offering a warm but potentially stifling
embrace. It has two choices: to leave the management in place to carry out
the divestment plan; or, if it grows dissatisfied, to press for management
changes. It has already indicated it will ask for seats on the Trafalgar
board.
Not surprisingly, Trafalgar's advisers were yesterday indicating that the
group views Hongkong Land's actions as hostile. Sir Eric Parker said: 'If
there was a full bid we would know where we stood. But this in-between
situation is unacceptable.
'We are in no mood to change the board. However, if Hongkong Land gets
control of 29 per cent of the shares we will have to listen to what they
have to say.'
A move by Hongkong Land to realise some of the value locked away in a
weakened Trafalgar House may not be without risk. Trafalgar itself
discovered the perils of bargain-hunting last year when it bought Davy.
Trafalgar seemed to be paying a discount price when it agreed to pay Pounds
114m for Davy. Since then, however, it has had to inject more than Pounds
100m of working capital into Davy, after finding that its problems were
worse than it had thought.
As a result, Trafalgar remains highly borrowed. Net debt, including off
balance sheet borrowings, is estimated by City analysts at about Pounds
550m, representing gearing of nearly 90 per cent. Group results for the 12
months to the end of September are expected to include further substantial
write-downs against its recession-hit housebuilding and commercial property
operations.
Analysts estimate that pre-tax profits for the period have fallen from
Pounds 122m to anywhere between Pounds 60m to Pounds 100m. Faced by these
difficulties, it would be surprising if Trafalgar pays better than a nominal
final dividend.
So how much is the business worth? It depends on whether you look at the
profit and loss statement or the balance sheet, according to Mr Andrew
Mitchell, conglomerates analyst with stockbroker Smith New Court.
He says the group's engineering and construction business needs few fixed
assets and is a generous cash generator; in the last 12 months, he thinks,
it has generated profits of more than Pounds 100m. Assuming earnings of 7p a
share and a conservative multiple of 12.5 times historic earnings, this
business alone could be worth 90p a share.
On the basis of 1992 earnings Mr Mitchell has calculated an overall value
for the group of 109p a share. That makes Trafalgar look cheap, based on
Wednesday's closing price of 60 1/2 p for the ordinary shares, and still
good value at yesterday's 89 1/2 p.
However, a look at the balance sheet produces a different answer. The
group's net asset value may have sunk as low as 33p a share, says Mr
Mitchell, if you discount the properties to reflect the current state of the
market. Such a calculation indicates that Hongkong Land might wish to follow
the Broackes strategy, selling the asset-heavy parts of the business to
concentrate on the engineering business created from Davy and John Brown.
When things go well, process engineering is a highly profitable, cash
generating business. There are huge sums at stake, however, in a typical
contract - and it only takes one contract to go wrong to wreck the profits.
That gives some force to Sir Eric Parker's comment yesterday: 'Hongkong Land
is just a property developer. What experience do they have of managing a
construction and engineering group?' If it came to a fight, however, he
might find that shareholders preferred a new hand, however inexperienced.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Shares in Forte rise despite profit fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotel and restaurant group, yesterday unveiled interim profits at
the lowest end of City expectations, warned of a difficult second half,
failed to announce hoped-for board changes - and was rewarded with a 14p
jump in its share price to 149p.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 24m for the six months to end-July were down 43
per cent on last year and Mr Rocco Forte, chief executive, warned: 'The
remainder of the year will not be easy.'
The group defied the prediction of some analysts that it would announce the
appointment of two new non-executive directors or unveil other board
changes, possibly including the retirement of Lord Forte, the founder and
chairman.
Mr Forte said, however, that the company was giving 'serious consideration'
to the composition of the board. 'I would be very surprised if you don't
hear something in the next six months,' he said.
Although Mr Forte said cost reductions had produced improved August and
September profits, Mr Paul Slattery of Kleinwort Benson said he thought
yesterday's share price increase was overdone. 'A lot of people are
expecting far too much of a turnround far too quickly,' he said. Mr Peter
Hilliar of Barclays de Zoete Wedd said, however, that the increase stemmed
from a belief that trading conditions were past their worst.
In spite of the fall at the pre-tax level, trading profits rose 2 per cent
to Pounds 93m. Sales were Pounds 1.36bn, up 3 per cent. The slight
improvement in trading profit was achieved in spite of an increase in the
depreciation charge from Pounds 43m to Pounds 49m. Mr Forte said Pounds 26m
in cost reductions had helped improve operating margins.
However, interest charges were Pounds 61m, compared with Pounds 51m last
time - a result, Mr Forte said, of substantial recent investment. This
included refurbishments at the Grosvenor House, Browns and Waldorf hotels in
London.
The Pounds 1.295m net borrowings at the end of the half year showed little
change from the start of the year. The interim dividend was maintained at
2.75p on earnings per share down to 1.6p.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Westpac chairman and four directors quit after criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman and four directors of Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia's
biggest bank, resigned yesterday in the face of criticism from the markets
and financial institutions.
Sir Eric Neal, chairman, Sir Neil Currie, deputy chairman, and three other
long-serving directors had accepted responsibility for heavy losses and bad
debts which had halved the bank's share price.
Westpac's problems came to a head last week when a ADollars 1.2bn (Pounds
488m) rights issue closed 72 per cent undersubscribed, forcing the
underwriters to take up shares worth about ADollars 860m. This followed a
disastrous first half in which the bank incurred pre-tax losses of ADollars
2.2bn after writing off ADollars 2.65bn against bad debts, including a
ADollars 2.1bn write-down of its property portfolio.
Westpac said Sir Eric would be replaced by Mr John Uhrig, chairman of CRA,
the mining group 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK. Sir James Balderstone,
chairman of the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, was
appointed deputy chairman.
None of the departing directors was available for comment. Mr Uhrig said
they had resigned voluntarily 'on the basis of the need to demonstrate board
responsibility'. He would not comment on why a number of other long serving
directors had not resigned.
Mr Uhrig said there would be no immediate change in the bank's strategy of
cutting costs, improving efficiency and resuscitating its battered public
image.
Analysts said the resignations would help stimulate market support for
Westpac's shares, which have collapsed from ADollars 3.87 in August to less
than ADollars 3, about half the level of two years ago.
Westpac has suffered deteriorating losses for the last two years as falling
asset prices have exposed the poor quality of many loans and property
investments made during a period of rapid expansion in the late 1980s.
The mass resignation follows strong private pressure for tough action from
institutional investors, and a campaign against the bank by dissident
shareholders and much of the media.
The Australian Financial Review yesterday called for the resignation of the
entire board.
Westpac shares closed one cent higher at ADollars 2.86 on the Australian
Stock Exchange.

FT  02 OCT 92 / TI makes Pounds 87m provisions for Dowty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI Group, the engineering and aerospace company, yesterday said it has set
up provisions of Pounds 87.1m to cover integration costs and asset
write-downs following the Pounds 525m acquisition of Dowty three months ago.
The announcement was welcomed in the City where TI's acquisition accounting
policies have been criticised in the past. The detailed breakdown and
relatively modest level of fair value adjustments helped push TI's shares
12p higher to 282p.
TI says it has found no significant surprises in a detailed review of
Dowty's operations. The only changes since the bid was launched are that the
aerospace business is likely to remain more depressed for longer and global
economic recovery has receded further than anticipated.
Mr Michael Garner, finance director, described the level of provisions as
'totally within our range of expectations'. More than half the provisions
are cash items, rather than asset write-downs, and seen by the company as
productive investment.
TI's write-offs mean that net shareholders' funds will have increased by
only Pounds 100m, to Pounds 345m, as a result of the acquisition in spite of
the Pounds 525m price tag on Dowty. TI argues that this small increase is a
result of building a knowledge and service-based business where assets such
as the team of sales engineers are intangible.
Gross shareholders' funds - a measure of the assets which includes goodwill
 -rise from Pounds 715m to Pounds 1.23bn as a result of the Dowty
acquisition.
'We are buying earnings streams, cash-flow streams and market position and
only peripherally the hard edged assets represented by the Pounds 100m
addition to shareholders funds after write-offs,' Mr Garner said.
TI says its decision to take Dowty back to its old and well-respected
international aerospace roots has been well received by its customers.
Dowty has already taken a Pounds 25m write-off to cover closure of the
Cognito paging business; the information technology business, another
digression from Dowty's core aerospace business, has already been sold to
Cray Electronics.
TI confirmed that it believed the Dowty acquisition would not dilute
earnings materially in 1993.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Personal View: ERM - the way back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIR LEON BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there a way out of Britain's ERM dilemma? Sterling clearly cannot go back
in the near future to the full discipline of the ERM as it currently stands.
But it is doubtful that a purely domestic monetary policy will carry
credibility and provide the necessary discipline. I believe it is possible
to devise a genuine new discipline which is not unacceptably constraining by
an imaginative adaptation of the ERM structure.
The problems are, however, real. After the D-Mark, sterling remains the most
widely traded currency in Europe. And the confidence that the ERM is a
quasi-fixed exchange rate system capable of defying market forces has been
dented. We need to find the best way forward for sterling and perhaps some
other currencies which provides the advantages of exchange rate stability
while recognising these difficulties and allowing for change without
disrupting the EMS system.
We should consider seriously the idea of a modified link between the core
ERM members and currencies such as sterling through a flexible band system.
The UK would agree with the other EMS members a central rate and 6 per cent
band for the pound with the usual access to the various EMS financing
facilities. The obligation agreed would, however, not be to respect that
band unconditionally but to treat it as an exchange rate target.
By agreeing a central rate through the EMS the British government would be
signalling its intention to hold sterling to this level in its day-to-day
financial management in the same way as other ERM members. But in the event
of exceptionally disruptive markets the government could allow sterling to
move outside the parity band for a limited period.
Thus in the event of severe speculative pressures the pound could be allowed
to move outside the parity band without Britain being obliged to intervene
in the markets or raise interest rates to protect the pound. And Britain's
EMS partners would then also be required to undertake open-ended
intervention to support the pound.
But this exceptional flexibility would be limited in time. Over the
following period of perhaps 30 days the UK authorities would be obliged to
ensure that sterling moved back inside the original parity band or to seek a
realignment. Thirty days would provide ample time for short-term speculative
pressure, such as that which occurred before the French referendum, to play
itself out and for more stable market conditions to return. The Bank of
England would be more effective in turning the tables on speculators if the
markets could not be sure that every flurry would automatically be
counteracted. It would have the freedom to choose the best moment to
intervene effectively to restore the exchange rate within the parity band.
But if it was clear that more fundamental forces were at work the option of
a formal realignment would remain open. This would be agreed collectively
within the EMS mechanism, as now.
The advantage of such a flexible band outside the EMS core is twofold. It
provides a political means of ensuring that currencies which are unable to
participate at present in the EMS narrow band would remain politically
committed to the EMS system. Britain should continue to benefit from the 14
years of EMS management and participate fully in the system's development.
Economically, it offers the advantage of providing the exchange rate
discipline necessary for an effective monetary policy. The markets would
know the government's exchange rate target, which would carry more
credibility because it could not be changed unilaterally. But the
flexibility to deal with speculative crises would also be there. That
increase in credibility would also allow interest rates to be reduced more
rapidly than could otherwise be the case.
The UK's search for an alternative monetary lodestar in the 1980s ended in
failure. It was possible to do whatever political pressures dictated and
rely on one or other interpretation of the range of indicators to justify
it. This led to an increasing reliance on the exchange rate as the key
indicator - and then to membership of the ERM.
If this way forward were to be adopted, as UK inflation continues to decline
and the economy recovers the way would be open progressively to strengthen
the ERM link, consistent with the three-stage Emu process. The arrangement
could be agreed for a limited period, as a way to ease the reinsertion of
sterling into the central ERM disciplines.
The benefits which the ERM has provided to Europe are immense. But as we
have seen the ERM has limitations inherent in any partially fixed exchange
rate structure. We now need to increase the ERM's flexibility without
weakening its attractions for those able to move further towards fixed
exchange rates and a single currency. A revision of the ERM on these lines
would enable us to strengthen the EMS as an exchange rate structure for the
whole Community and to continue together towards economic prosperity in
Europe.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Insurance policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS TO rescue Municipal Mutual, the stricken local-authority owned
insurance company, are running out of steam. MMI, which is the ninth largest
insurance company in the UK, has ceased to sell new policies and placed a
seven-day moratorium on claims payments on existing policies. The company is
talking to leading insurers who might take over some parts of the business,
including its portfolio of home and motor policies. But chances of finding a
buyer for the rest appear slim, with the Paris-based La Garantie Mutuelle
des Fonctionnaires no longer interested in acquiring the company.
There are many facets of the MMI story which will be familiar to observers
of the UK financial services industry. The company started life as a niche
player, insuring local authority business. The conservative management
approach won more than 80 per cent of the business. But in the 1980s, MMI
expanded aggressively out of its core business into other areas of the
insurance market, especially individual home and motor policies. Larger
rivals were undercut to win market share.
This expansion accelerated after changes in the ownership structure of the
company which diluted local authority control. These were designed to meet
the requirements of the 1989 Local Government Act which sought to force
councils to divest themselves of commercial businesses. They also gave
management more leeway to pursue expansion: premium income rose further,
more than doubling between 1987 and 1991.
Recent growth has been accompanied by the deterioration in trading
conditions which afflicted the insurance industry as a whole. Bad weather,
rising crime and civil disorder pushed up claims on domestic policies. But
the core business was also hit, with increased claims from local authorities
following events such as the Hillsborough football disaster and the exposure
of the repressive 'pin-down' regime in Staffordshire children's homes.
Claims rose threefold between 1987 and 1991, considerably faster than
premium income. In May, a big increase in reserves to cover business written
in the past left MMI's net assets at Pounds 4.9m and its solvency margin
well below levels normally accepted in the industry.
At this stage, intervention might have been expected from the Department of
Trade and Industry, which is responsible for regulating insurance companies.
Despite the company's parlous state, the DTI allowed it to continue to write
new business. One factor which appears to have influenced that decision was
the interest expressed by La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires in taking
it over. Earlier this week, that rescue bid collapsed - apparently to the
surprise of MMI, which had assured the world that the talks were still on.
It is not clear whether there have been regulatory failures by the DTI in
this case. But prima facie there is a case to answer. In particular, the DTI
appears to have allowed MMI to continue trading with a solvency margin well
below the minimum regarded as normal on the basis of a rescue bid which has
since evaporated and appears not to have been a binding agreement.
An independent inquiry is needed to determine the facts. Then a judgment to
be made on whether the regulatory framework itself is adequate.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The October revolution: The privatisation of Russian
industry promises to create a society of capitalist shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of the bulk of Russia's industry, which began officially
yesterday, is revolutionary in design. By creating a class of responsible
property owners capable of exercising rational economic choices, it seeks to
resurrect a bourgeoisie which the now-discarded Soviet regime once sought to
consign to the dustbin of history.
'Privatisation on this scale,' said Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime
minister in charge of privatisation, 'is unprecedented in the history of
Russia . . . of the world'.
Moreover, privatisation - the most visible and important part of the Russian
reform programme - is now seen as unstoppable. The parliament, which has
often shown itself to be an uncertain and febrile body, has endorsed it. Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker and no friend of the government, called it
'effectively irreversible'.
That is not to say it is universally popular. The Russian government is so
deeply disliked that almost everything it does is greeted with suspicion. On
the political level, the roughly one-third of the deputies who maintain
communist or nationalist positions are bitterly opposed. One of them, Mr
Gennady Savenko, last week threw a fistful of privatisation vouchers in the
face of Mr Chubais, shouting 'all property of any worth will end up in the
hands of the rich]'
This is a widely held view. As Mr Konstantin Ovchinnikov, a government
chauffeur, remarked: 'There used to be a communist slogan about the west: it
was where 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. That's what
privatisation will mean.' This overwhelmingly poor society, which was
accustomed to officially promoted egalitarianism, has grown even poorer over
the past two years. Now it is being asked to tolerate the rapid expansion of
a conspicuously wealthy class.
The young officials charged with the privatisation project acknowledge this,
but counter it. 'There already was in the socialist times a privileged class
 -huge and hidden,' says Mr Maxime Boiko, chief aide to Mr Chubais. 'In a
market economy, of course, it becomes open and evident. But I think this
country has a large tolerance for inequality.'
The privatisation scheme, which officially opened yesterday, is complex. In
its first stage, vouchers with a value of Rbs10,000 - giving the bearer the
right to buy company shares - are to be distributed to every member of the
public through 40,000 branches of savings banks across the country. In a
country of 150m people, this means that about Rbs1,500bn in vouchers will be
distributed.
At the same time, between 5,000 and 7,000 enterprises representing about 70
per cent of Russia's vast productive capacity are completing 'privatisation
plans' in close consultation with their workforces. These plans are
essentially choices between three main options laid out by the State
Committee for Property, headed by Mr Chubais. They are:
The assignment of 25 per cent of the shares to the 'work collective'
(managers and workers) for free; a further 10 per cent would be available to
workers and 5 per cent to managers at 0.7 per cent of the shares' book
value, which state auditors assigned to them. Workers would enjoy a further
30 per cent discount on these shares.
The offer of 51 per cent of the shares to the collective at 1.7 per cent of
their book value.
The assignment of 20 per cent of the shares, for free, to those workers and
managers who chose to form a group committed to restructuring the company; a
further 20 per cent would be sold to all members of the collective at 0.7
per cent of book value.
Under each option, the work collective can use both its vouchers and cash to
buy the shares, though a limit of 35 per cent of the total has been set on
the number of shares which can be bought through vouchers. In addition, at
least 10 per cent of the shares must be available to the general public to
buy with their vouchers.
The general public can sell their vouchers for cash, or use them to buy
shares in the privatised companies, which are to be auctioned after December
1. The vouchers must be spent before the end of next year or they will lose
their value. They are to be redeemed by the government, while the cash spent
on the purchase of shares by the public will go to local and regional
authorities.
No one is certain how many citizens will opt to sell their vouchers. Even
before yesterday's distribution, a secondary market had begun in which
people, especially the elderly, had pre-sold their vouchers, reportedly for
around their face value or slightly above.
Mr Chubais believes, on the basis of his own polls, that only some 30 to 40
per cent of the population will sell their vouchers. Other estimates made by
opposition deputies claim that 80 per cent will do so.
For those who hold on to their shares, and who are not members of companies
to be privatised - such as state school teachers, municipal workers and
others - the 200 or so mutual funds already set up are likely to be
attractive.
In theory foreigners are for the most part as free as Russians to take part
in this 'sale of the century'. They are restricted from investing in some
defence and energy enterprises, and they have been excluded - except by
special permission - from the privatisation of shops and small businesses
which is already under way.
But in practice, it seems likely that most foreigners will stay out of the
Russian market until ownership and control patterns have emerged over the
next year or two - the estimated time it will take fully to privatise the
large companies. The legal structure is still raw and incomplete; the
enterprises are little known; and their managements are not yet familiar
with the demands of a market economy.
Mr Chubais pointed out that some foreign companies have concluded some 'very
interesting' deals under which they would assist the work collectives in
buying shares in exchange for a part of the share capital. Despite this,
privatisation is unlikely to prove a quick bonanza for foreign capitalists,
as the communists and nationalists claim.
But will privatisation bring about the dynamics of a genuine market economy,
as the government intends? Or will the exercise merely result in companies
nominally owned by their workers and managers, but continuing to demand
state protection and cheap credits, and threatening production strikes if
they do not get them? Such tendencies are evident in many private
enterprises which already exist. Indeed, the entire process clearly means
different things to different people.
To many, privatisation has already happened. On most calculations, more than
20 per cent of the Russian workforce is employed in the 'private' sector -
in about 200,000 co-operatives created as private enterprises, in former
state shops which already have been taken private, and in foreign companies
and joint ventures. In addition, there are many larger companies which have
recently been taken over by their workers and managers. Some have done so
through a now-repealed Soviet law, while others have been taken over
illegally, with management agreeing with their workers to create a company
owned 100 per cent by themselves, and bribing local bureaucrats to register
it.
This process, known as 'wild' or nomenklatura privatisation, has given rise
to a sector known as closed joint stock companies. In these, shares are not
traded. Management usually exercises de facto control, and in many cases is
now buying back shares issued to workers in exchange for roubles, hard
currency or imported goods. This practice has largely gone unpunished and is
likely to irritate those companies now being told to privatise according to
the rules.
Privatisation may mean quite another thing within the larger,
state-controlled sector, in which managers and workers constitute a
potentially conservative (and largely united) class. Despite the progressive
collapse of effective state control over companies the government formally
owns, they generally have not adopted market-oriented pricing, investment or
marketing strategies. Instead, they have kept prices and wages as high as
possible while demanding government support or cheap credit from commercial
banks to keep them going - so far successfully. Meanwhile, the lack of
bankruptcy legislation (which is expected to be enacted later this month)
has meant that none of these enterprises could legally go out of business.
This resistance is wholly natural. The intended consequence of privatisation
is to separate the winners from the losers; that is, to produce industries
which can eventually compete on an international level. This - coupled with
the more restrictive monetary policy the government says it is determined to
adopt - will certainly mean the end for many companies, and unemployment for
their workers. There is a vast amount at stake.
For this reason, the industrialists' lobby - represented most notably by Mr
Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and
General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president - is actually a much tougher
opponent to the government than the noisier critics on the far left and
right. In a recent interview in Rabochaya Tribuna, a daily newspaper, Mr
Volsky said the privatisation programme was 'too strict', and called for the
legal right of the collectives to buy all their own shares and form the kind
of closed joint stock companies created by the so-called 'wild'
privatisations.
Ultimately, since Russia is at least partly democratic, the people should
decide. But they appear confused. This is no surprise since they are being
asked to grapple with strange concepts and unfamiliar choices, and the
post-Soviet bureaucracy is not making the job any easier. For most
Muscovites, the only official notice of yesterday's voucher scheme was a
typewritten memo posted in the ill-lit halls of their apartment blocks.
The government is planning an information drive including media advertising,
packages explaining the options to companies and even a privatisation game
show on TV. But it is grossly overstretched, despite resources for the
programme supplied by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development,
with assistance from the World Bank and the EC.
'This is the start of capitalist education in this country,' said Mr Chubais
on the eve of the campaign. It will be a long, hard lesson.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Mr Major off the fence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECLARATION by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, that he wishes
to bring the Maastricht treaty back for ratification in the House of Commons
around the end of the year, is a welcome step forward.
Everyone knows that the ratification debate is likely to be the scene of a
bruising confrontation between the government and the Eurosceptics in the
Conservative party; but in the last resort Mr Major is politically committed
to the treaty, and there is no sense in which he can avoid the confrontation
by procrastination. If the treaty is to be ratified, the Eurosceptics will
have to be faced down, and it will be up to Mr Major to exercise the
appropriate leadership over his party to secure the necessary majority.
As far as it goes, then, Mr Major's announcement sends the right signal to
the Conservative party, to British public opinion, and to the governments of
the other member states in the European Community. If the government looked
as though it was scrabbling for any and every pretext to run away from the
Maastricht treaty, Mr Major has now given notice that he intends to stand
and fight, for a treaty which he claimed a bare 10 months ago as a triumph
for Britain.
Moreover, his words last night may gain him time. In the face of what looked
like British delaying tactics, some other European governments have
apparently been flirting with the idea that an inner core of member states
might move ahead without Britain. If they are now persuaded that Mr Major is
really determined to stand up for the treaty, they may also be readier to
negotiate with Britain rather than leave it behind.
Mr Major seems to have been emboldened to declare his position by the belief
that he can secure agreement with the other member states, perhaps at the
Birmingham summit this month, on a form of words which will make it easier
for him to get the treaty through the House of Commons. Since the government
is most anxious to fend off accusations by Eurosceptics that the Maastricht
treaty will introduce an interfering, centralised federal state, its top
priority will be to strengthen the principle of subsidiarity by which the
Community should only engage in policies which cannot be done better in the
nation states.
Whether an interpretative declaration by the 12 governments will really give
the principle of subsidiarity the force of law may be open to doubt; it may
also be questioned whether a mere declaration will make a large difference
to the balance of votes in the House of Commons. But that is the judgment
which the government must make; and it is in the House that it must fight
and win its victory.
Last night's lecture to the European Policy Forum, by Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, was obviously intended to prepare the ground for this
debate. But it cannot be described as an inspiring document. Mr Hurd is
known to be a committed European and supporter of the Maastricht treaty; yet
his lecture was an exercise in faint praise, in which his main purpose
seemed to be to minimise the significance of the treaty.
It is now up to Mr Major to lead his party beyond this timorous position.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Bank on the poor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration is often criticised for a lack of vision in policy,
but it has shown foresight in its dealings with Latin America. Its decision
to seek, for example, a free trade agreement with Mexico and to offer that
prospect to other Latin countries has provided a genuine opportunity to
change an often adversarial relationship.
This constructive attitude is reflected in radical, but thoughtful,
proposals to reform the InterAmerican Development Bank outlined last month
by the Treasury.
Behind them are worries that democracy and the recent economic advances in
Latin America - reforms of budgets and the structure of economies, which are
beginning to be reflected in growth - may be jeopardised by popular
reaction.
The perception that adjustment programmes benefit the rich and hurt the poor
 -sometimes, but not universally, true - needs to be corrected. An important
element of the wide-ranging US proposals for the IADB is a concrete attempt
to address this issue. It suggests half of the bank's lending should be
devoted to improving the lot of the worse off and making sure the benefits
of growth are more broadly spread.
This is not only good politics, it is good economics. Investing in the poor,
in better primary education and improved health provision, in particular,
yields high economic returns.
A promise to focus on poverty is easy to outline, tough to carry out.
Getting money through to the needy has been a long-standing problem for the
region's governments own poverty programmes. Cash passes through many greedy
hands before reaching the needy, and badly-designed poverty programmes can
raise a country's debt without benefiting its people. Washington has
recognised that the bank's offices must be restructured to allow close
collaboration with affected populations.
The IADB has undergone significant changes, mostly for the better, over the
past few years. Now it must accept further change. The US proposals are
sensible and have been set out in a constructive fashion. They should be
welcomed in the region and taken up next year, by whatever administration is
in the White House.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK bank admits infringements: Standard Chartered says it
knew of irregularities in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered Bank, the UK-based international banking group, admitted
yesterday that it was aware that its Indian banking operations could be
infringing regulations 18 months before India's Rs35bn (Pounds 717m)
securities scandal erupted in May this year.
Mr Barry Northrop, special representative for India, said senior managers in
London had believed the problems had been corrected after an internal
investigation: 'To our obvious embarrassment, we discovered we were wrong.'
Standard Chartered has provided Pounds 100m for possible losses incurred
trading in the Bombay securities markets. It says it was defrauded and is
looking to get money back through the courts.
In 1990, the bank's inspectors were alerted to possible irregularities in a
department handling corporate clients' funds for investment. An executive in
Bombay filed a report alleging that funds were invested in commercial loans
and securities markets, contravening central bank rules and internal
guidelines.
The bank's inspectors confirmed the suspicions and said in a report the
merchant banking division in Bombay had 'aggressively pursued business for
the group's benefit and deliberately or mistakenly circumvented proper
avenues of control'.
It said:'This may lead to short-term profit . . . but it is probably a
recipe for eventual loss and possibly action that could affect the bank as a
whole and not just the merchant banking division.'
The report was supplied by the bank to a parliamentary committee
investigating the affair. Mr Northrop confirmed its contents.
Mr Northrop said that executives in the merchant banking division had
disputed the 1990 inspection report, arguing that the business did not
infringe guidelines and producing a legal opinion to this effect. A
compromise was reached under which the division was permitted to continue
portfolio management under strict guidelines.
However, said Mr Northrop, when the scandal broke, it emerged that the
guidelines had been infringed. He said the bank's controls had been weak. A
manager has been sacked and the bank has virtually stopped portfolio
management. Mr Northrop said the bank had done nothing which other banks
were not doing. Inquiries by the central bank and by the parliamentary
committee have established that various banks infringed guidelines on
securities trading.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Ofwat call for 2% cut in charges hits water share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER company shares fell yesterday after Ofwat, the water industry
regulator, decided to seek a 2 per cent cut in water charges for 1993-94
from 19 of the 32 water companies in England and Wales.
Because of the recession, the 10 publicly quoted water and sewerage
companies, and nine of the 22 water-only companies, have been able to carry
out their capital investment programmes at lower cost than projected in
1989, Ofwat said.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said yesterday: 'I need to ensure
that customers get the service for which they have paid.' His decision
follows Ofwat's warning last month that water bills could double in real
terms by 2005 because of the huge investment needed to meet new
environmental rules.
Ofwat's report was described as 'short-termism - worse than ever', by Mr
Michael Hoffman, chief executive of Thames Water, who said the government
had committed the industry to a 'major, long-term capital programme to
improve standards'.
However, Mr Graham Hawker, group managing director of Welsh Water, said:
'Ofwat wants us to keep 1.5 points below the maximum increase allowed -
which we had already told customers we would voluntarily do back in July.'
The 10 water and sewerage companies on which Ofwat has served notice are:
Anglian, Welsh, North West, Northumbrian, Severn Trent, Southern, South
West, Thames, Wessex and Yorkshire. The nine water-only companies are:
Bournemouth and West Hampshire, Cambridge, East Worcester, Mid Kent, North
Surrey, South East, Tendring Hundred, Three Valleys, Wrexham and East
Denbighshire.
Last year Ofwat asked water companies to volunteer to hold back price
increases by an average of 1 percentage point. It is now formally
recommending that they continue that reduction, and also make a further 1
point cut in increases from April 1 1993.
Ofwat's decision, an Interim Adjustment, surprised the stock market.
Analysts had not expected changes to the charging structure ahead of Ofwat's
Periodic Review in 1994, a wide-ranging industry assessment.
In its 1991-92 Report on Capital Investment and Financial Performance in the
Water Companies in England and Wales, also published yesterday, Ofwat said
'the pre-tax profits of the regulated water companies, adjusted for
inflation, rose by 8 per cent in 1991-92 to Pounds 1.2bn - rather faster
than had been expected'.
Water companies can issue a counter-notice to Ofwat within the next 14 days
if they believe other capital spending has offset the benefit from lower
construction prices.

FT  02 OCT 92 / US report on BCCI attacks Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN, ANDREW JACK and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England was yesterday accused of 'wholly inadequate' regulation
of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and of withholding
information about BCCI's frauds for 15 months before closing the bank.
This was the conclusion of a four-year US Senate sub-committee investigation
into BCCI by Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Senator
Hank Brown, a Colorado Republican, in a report published yesterday in
Washington.
The Kerry report said that although the Bank received evidence of BCCI fraud
in the spring of 1990 it 'colluded in the suppression of the true facts
concerning BCCI's financial status and its involvement in fraud'.
Although the 780-page report does not offer any conclusive new evidence
about the fraud, it states that alleged errors in judgment by the Bank
'collectively materially contributed to the losses incurred' by BCCI's
depositors and creditors in the closure of the bank on July 5 1991.
Mr Kerry yesterday attacked the Bank for having 'acquiesced' in allowing Abu
Dhabi, the BCCI majority shareholder, to remove vital documents from Britain
in 1990 as a quid pro quo for Abu Dhabi's agreement to restructure BCCI. The
Bank yesterday would not comment, saying it had to maintain confidentiality
until the publication of Lord Justice Bingham's inquiry into BCCI's
supervision. The Bingham report is expected this month.
The Bank said it was not asked to supply documents or evidence to Senator
Kerry. It believed that Lord Justice Bingham's inquiry would be more
thorough as he had examined documents and interviewed Bank officials.
The Kerry report claimed Abu Dhabi's involvement in BCCI was greater than
acknowledged.
Senator Kerry disclosed yesterday that Abu Dhabi is under investigation by
Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney who brought BCCI fraud
charges last year. Abu Dhabi last night rejected the findings contained in
the Kerry report.
The report also criticised Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors. It claimed
that as early as 1987, Price Waterhouse had 'ample reason' to recognise
there could be no basis for certifying BCCI's books and records gave a true
and fair view of BCCI's finances.
Senator Kerry was especially swingeing over what he termed 'a direct
conflict of interest' by Price Waterhouse partners who received loans from
BCCI while auditing the bank's operation.
Price Waterhouse rejected the Kerry report findings as full of
'unsubstantiated assertions', and expressed outrage that the committee had
not responded to its offer to talk to it in London.
More than 90 per cent of creditors to BCCI have voted for the joint
liquidators' plan, in another move to its acceptance. The vote on the plan,
involving payment to creditors of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 691m) to Dollars
1.7bn, was ordered by the Luxembourg court. The plan has been approved in
the UK and Cayman Island courts.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Redland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to fault Redland's long-term strategy in the light of yesterday's
11 per cent decline in interim earnings per share. The merger benefits from
Steetley so far are greater than anticipated at the time of the bid, even if
the results from France will be disappointing this year. Redland stands out
from some of its more pussy-footing peers in the way it is tackling
overcapacity in UK building materials. While one can quibble with the way it
has chosen to revalue certain Steetley assets, the balance sheet is solid
and well structured.
As with Blue Circle, however, the market is obsessed by Redland's dividend.
Yesterday's 19p fall in the shares to 343p was prompted by new fears that
the 1993 payout will be cut. It certainly looks touch-and-go on current
assumptions as to whether a maintained dividend will be fully covered, but
so much depends on the resilience of Germany and the outlook for the UK when
the decision is taken in March 1994. That is an awfully long way off. If the
dividend is then maintained, the 9.7 per cent yield makes the shares an
attractive bet, not least because of the gearing impact of any UK recovery.
Redland's ACT position will ensure that any profit increase flows quickly
through to the bottom line.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK water companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, clearly caught the water companies
napping with his proposal to curb price increases by 2 per cent. Having
agreed to restrain rises by around 1 per cent last year, the industry
ex-pected plain sailing up to the comprehensive periodic review in 1994.
However, the 3 per cent fall in the companies' share prices yesterday owed
more to surprise at the regulator's ambush than to real worries about the
industry's financial prospects.
That surprise looks rather overdone. With the regulatory noose tightening
everywhere, clawing back the benefits of lower than anticipated construction
costs was the least Mr Byatt could do to maintain a macho reputation as a
watchdog. Water company profits are running around 25 per cent ahead of
estimates before privatisation. Yesterday's announcement will only cut next
year's pre-tax figure by some 2 or 3 per cent. Earnings growth and dividend
cover will remain high. There is no financial reason why water companies
cannot continue to pay real dividend increases of 5 to 6 per cent a year.
That said, the periodic review hangs heavily over the industry. Companies
are understandably nervous at any hardening of the regulator's position.
Some may even be tempted to try their strength against Mr Byatt by opposing
this price restraint. Such tactics would only draw attention to their strong
finances. Granted the review will make life harder for water companies, but
shareholders have far more to lose from the ultimate sanction of a
Monopolies Commission investigation than they could ever hope to gain.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems perverse that Forte's shares should rise by 10 per cent in response
to first half profit figures 43 per cent below those achieved during last
year's difficult Gulf war period. The explanation is only partly that the
City had been primed to expect bad news. The market is also wondering if the
company's fortunes have passed their nadir. There are faint signs of
improvement in hotels; the devaluation should bring more US visitors to
London; last but not least Rocco Forte was uncharacteristically chipper in
his presentation of the figures.
But Mr Forte was doubtless well-groomed by his public relations people. His
story hardly constitutes a convincing turnround. Room rates and occupancy
are well below their level two years ago. The hotel business has managed
gross cost savings of Pounds 26m and promises more, but on a net basis costs
are virtually flat. Net debt is up more than 6 per cent despite Pounds 69m
in cash receipts from the exercise of Eurobond warrants. Forte still shows
no ability to trade its way into a more comfortable cash position. Perhaps
that is why capital spending next year will be lower than in 1986.
It might be different if the board were strengthened and Gardner Merchant
successfully sold. The sale would provide the resources for expansion in
Europe at a time when properties may be going cheap. As it is, the company
seems to be hedging its bets, with mutterings about the possibility of
attacking Europe through management contracts which do not require much
capital. The remaining picture is of hatches battened down till economic
recovery arrives. At 149p much of that recovery must be in the price.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Battle of Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though the good ship Trafalgar House has been well and truly
holed by yesterday's dawn raid - and subsequent tender offer - from Hongkong
Land. The question is whether the company will now sink ignominiously into
the arms of its Far Eastern predator. For many in the City such a fate will
be what Trafalgar's management richly deserves. Investors' patience has been
sorely tried over the past couple of years by a series of strategic
blunders, financial shocks, and apparent boardroom disunity. For some time
the issue has been whether anyone would be prepared to come to the rescue.
Much depends on the precise intentions of Land, and what sort of a fist
Trafalgar makes of a seemingly weak hand. One must assume that Land
genuinely wants to stick at 30 per cent, and hopes to make its presence felt
through its own directors and the undoubted influence its stake would be
able to wield over a cash-strapped company.
Other shareholders might wince at the prospect of backdoor control and rush
to tender their shares; alternatively they might conclude that even without
a full bid a fresh broom can yet unlock shareholder value. Therein lies the
crux. Quantifying the real value of the asset rich businesses is an
uncertain and highly unscientific game. If Trafalgar's management cannot
make a reasonable case that 85p per share is not enough, then it deserves no
mercy.

FT  02 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Far East raid on Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE opening of the market, all eyes were trained on conglomerate
Trafalgar House as broker SG Warburg launched a dawn raid on the hotels,
shipping, construction and engineering group. The move not only excited the
market but sent the shares sharply higher on turnover soaring to record
levels.
Word quickly spread that Warburg was shopping for a 15 per cent stake in
Trafalgar at 85p, some 25p above Wednesday's close, but, apparently, with an
order from the predator that only an outright 15 per cent was acceptable.
The few doubts about the likely success of the Warburg operation were
dispelled by mid afternoon when a majority of the required stake went
through the market. The ordinary shares jumped 29 to close at 89 1/2 p, and
the 'A' 28 1/2 p to 86p. Turnover in the ordinary shares reached a hefty
169m, while 44m 'A' shares were traded.
Shortly after the market closed, it was announced that Hongkong Land had
taken a 14.9 per cent stake in Trafalgar and was making a tender offer for
an additional 15 per cent stake at 85p. A full scale bid was ruled out for
at least a year. Mr Bruce Davidson at Smith New Court said, 'this places a
floor on the share price but it will be difficult to see the price advance
while Hongkong are still in the picture'
Trafalgar was quoted at between 84 and 87p, in after hours trading.
Shell in demand
Shell Transport outpaced a generally strong oil sector after a senior
executive of Shell Oil, the group's US division, carried out a series of
one-to-one meetings with analysts from many leading London broking houses.
Shell Transport shares raced up 9 to 546p on good turnover of 5.1m shares.
Oil specialists said they were mainly boosted by sterling's weakness,
notably against currencies linked to the D-Mark. Shell Transport would have
to increase its sterling dividend proportionally more than Royal Dutch's
payment in D-mark-linked Guilders to compensate for the decline in the UK
currency.
The Shell Oil meetings were said to have gone well with the oil company
highlighting to Panmure Gordon, the UK broking house, the significance of
progress in the Gulf of Mexico and recent increases in US gas prices
following Hurricane Andrew.
BP also attracted keen support, with dealers surprised at the weight of
buying from UK institutions. Turnover, which reached 16m shares, was also
boosted by the unwinding of positions said to have been taken out during the
big programme-trade activity of recent sessions. BP ended the day 4 higher
at 218 1/2 p.
Enterprise Oil added 6 more to 428p with the market warming up ahead of
Monday's ADR listing in the US which will be accompanied by a series of
presentations to US institutions.
Water stocks hit
An announcement from the Office of Water Services (Ofwat), that it was
seeking cuts in domestic water charges of around 2 per cent for 1993/4 saw
UK water company shares in full retreat before rallying in the mid-session,
only to fall back again. The news also affected electricity stocks.
'This is obviously not good news and will mean that the water stocks could
well drift easier in the near future,' said Ms Rachel Lucas, a utilities
specialist at County NatWest. But she said the sector 'still offers three to
five per cent real dividend growth'. County said the Ofwat move would most
affect companies such as Severn Trent and Welsh Water.
The utilities team at Nomura described the Ofwat proposals as 'the annual
autumnal regulatory tightening', and said they were 'not entirely
unexpected'. Even after the planned cuts 'water dividends are still covered
three times', Nomura said.
Of the Footsie constituents, Anglian tumbled 18 1/2 to 420p, North West 16
to 442p, Severn Trent 19 to 396p and Thames 14 to 439p. The heaviest trade,
5.1m shares, was in Thames. Electricity stocks - 'the best way back into the
utilities sector,' according to County - were given a mauling, with Norweb
19 lower at 413p and South West 18 off at 384p.
Barclays Bank and Lloyds Bank shares, unsettled earlier this week by worries
about bad debts and property values, resumed their upward momentum. Barclays
jumped 12 to 349p on big turnover of 9.7m shares in response to stories that
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had recommended a switch from NatWest to Barclays.
NatWest slipped 4 to 359p on 3m traded.
BICC fell 12 to 260p after Smith New Court chopped current year profits
estimate to Pounds 120m and that for next year to Pounds 152m. Kleinwort
Benson was said to have reduced its current year estimate even further, to
around Pounds 100m.
Redland raced up to 3169p following interim figures at the top end of market
expectations, but fell back to end a busy session a net 19 lower at 343p.
The retreat came as analysts left a post-results meeting described by one as
'realistic, but generally gloomy'. He said Redland shares had suffered along
with other building materials shares which looked toppy after a recent good
run.
Contracting issues, battered by the recession, took heart from the move by
Hongkong Land to acquire a 30 per cent stake in Trafalgar House. But
property stocks, sustained recently by hints of possible predatory moves by
Hongkong Land, suffered from selling by disappointed speculators.
Business services group BET fell back 6 to 102p, after Smith New Court
downgraded its profit expectations for the current year by Pounds 47m to
Pounds 88m, and the following year's forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 128m.
The broker, however, expects BET to maintain its dividend at 6.5p. Turnover
was 4.7m.
Shares in international conglomerate Hanson gave up 6 to 210p, in trade of
15m shares, amid reports of a profits downgrade from Hoare Govett, its own
broker.
Shares in Forte brushed aside the much flagged disappointing interim results
and a clutch of downgradings and jumped 14 to 149p, in brisk trade of 16m
shares.
P&amp;O mentioned for most of the session as a likely predetor for Trafalgar
closed 2 up at 390p. Credit Lyonnais issued a buy recommendation on the
stock saying, 'trading cash flow is expected to turn positive from 1993,
alleviating any balance sheet concern.'
Asda Group edged up 1 1/2 to 35p, after a Pounds 57m disposal of
developments and sites. Henderson Crosthwaite said the sales represented

FT  02 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities brush aside currency factors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK STOCKS held up well yesterday in the face of the acrimonious dispute
between the British and German governments over the background to sterling's
effective devaluation and also to calls in the UK press for the resignation
of Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Excitement was
kindled by heavy trade in Trafalgar House, the shipping, hotels and
construction conglomerate, as Hongkong Land, one-third controlled by Jardine
Matheson, bought a 14.9 per cent stake.
Despite the further slide in the pound, the equity market continued to hope
for another cut in domestic base rates, taking its cue from rumours in the
foreign exchange markets that the Bundesbank might, after all, reduce German
rates today.
Equities made an uncertain start as investors awaited the outcome of a
meeting of UK government ministers after publication in London's morning
newspapers of a statement by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank
president, had sparked a bitter response from the Bank of England. However,
the UK chancellor left the meeting rejecting suggestions of resignation and
the stock market began to advance behind continued firmness in stock index
futures and the drama surrounding Trafalgar House.
The advance received a further spur in the second half of the session when
hints of an impending cut in German interest rates circulated both in Europe
and in the US. At best the Footsie showed a gain of 33.1 points but the
market then boiled over. By the close, the gain on the FT-SE Index had been
cut to 19.3 for a final reading of 2,572.3.
Confirmation that it was Hongkong Land chasing stock in Trafalgar House and
that it would tender for a further 15 per cent stake, came only late in the
day and there was some disappointment that there will be no full bid for at
least a year. Suggestions of an impending bid for a Footsie stock have been
circulating for some weeks.
Turnover of 168m shares in Trafalgar House made up about one fifth of the
day's total Seaq turnover in equities of 823m. There was also a heavy
overnight programme from a leading US house and a second programme crossed
the trading screens towards the close of business. Demand for oil shares, in
particular for Shell, was a late feature.
Wednesday's retail, or customer, business remained high, with the Pounds
1.5bn value figure maintaining the impetus of the past fortnight. County
NatWest, the London investment bank, commented that share placings from
companies and institutional shareholders have also been at a high level;
this could suggest that investors are unconvinced as to the permanence of
the rally in share prices which has greeted Britain's exit from the ERM
network.
Sterling's weakness impacted on the stock market in terms of improving the
attractions of share prices for overseas investors rather than by
undermining hopes for lower interest rates. Nor was confidence notably
harmed by the continuing flow of profits downgrades of leading UK companies
by brokerage houses.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets had a relatively quiet session but, despite the fall in
the pound, continued to give a good lead to the underlying equity prices,
writes Terry Byland. In the stock index sector, the December contract on the
FT-SE Index made a firm start, brushing off political uncertainties prompted
by calls in the press for the resignation of the UK chancellor of the
exchequer.
The contract struggled when it approached the 2,640 mark and lost impetus in
the afternoon when volume drifted away to return a final total for the
session of only 9,547 contracts. By the close, the contract had settled to
around 2,619, still a comfortable premium over the cash market. Traders
reported hints that German interest rates might be cut today.
In traded options, volume increased to 35,032 contracts from Wednesday's
23,653, with the sector led by the increased interest in Trafalgar House as
Hongkong Land built a stake. Trafalgar headed the actives list with 6,388
contracts, followed by the Euro FT-SE with 4,377 contracts and Asda, the
food supermarket, with 2,290. There was active trading in the British
Airways contracts (1,568) and in Ladbroke (1,116).
The FT-SE contract had a less active session, returning volume of 6,810
contracts.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The Property Market: A rich vein that may be losing its
lustre - Vanessa Houlder finds Anglo-French developer Paul Raingold upbeat
about his latest Parisian venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Raingold, one of the most prominent UK developers working in Paris,
has so far lived up to his propitious name. But at a time when the Paris
property market is gripped by recession, doubts are growing about his latest
 -and most ambitious - deal.
The deal, which was agreed in March 1991 and completed two weeks ago,
involves one of the most expensive development sites in Europe - the former
headquarters of oil company Esso in the heart of La Defense in the west of
Paris. The consortium developing the scheme - in which Mr Mr Raingold's
company, Generale Continentale Investissements (GCI), has a 6 1/4 per cent
share - paid FFr1.808bn (Pounds 200m) for the site; a further FFr1.356bn
(Pounds 150m) was paid to Epad, the local planning authority for La Defense,
as a contribution towards local infrastructure.
The total cost of the plan to build a 190,000 sq m office complex is about
Pounds 1bn. It will include two tower blocks of 700,000 sq ft each, shops,
restaurants and a modern art museum. Work is due to start within the next
six months with the demolition of the existing building.
Besides Generale Continentale, other investors in the scheme include
property developers Interconstruction and Kaufman &amp; Broad with an 8 3/4 per
cent share; the balance is owned by eight of France's leading financial
institutions, BNP, Indosuez, Credit Agricole, CFF, Credit National, Societe
Generale, Banque Worms and GAN.
The scheme has already provoked trepidation in some quarters. 'He (Mr
Raingold) has hit gold in La Defense before. But I am nervous that he has
gone too far this time,' says one Paris agent. 'The banks could lose
millions.'
The agent's concerns are three-fold. Does La Defense, where 2m sq ft out of
a total of 25m sq ft of office space is already empty, need another 2m sq ft
development? Is the scheme, which is designed to be built in a single phase,
sufficiently flexible? Was the price paid for the site, agreed before the
worst of the property downturn, excessive?
These doubts are not shared by the project's admirers. They point out that
at least half the 2m sq ft of empty space in La Defense is in small areas
scattered around old buildings. Moreover, La Defense's empty space may be
absorbed and the market in general may have emerged from recession by the
time the scheme comes onto the market in 1996. 'The great advantage of the
Esso project is its timing,' says Mr Robert Lipscomb of Healey &amp; Baker, the
UK property advisers.
Mr Raingold does not claim to have tenants lined up, although he says that
20 per cent of space at the new site has been pre-sold to GAN, one of the
scheme's backers.
He vigorously defends the acquisition. 'We are very confident. It is a
long-term deal and an exceptional site.' Mr Raingold justifies the price
paid for the site, insisting that it reflected the downturn in the Paris
property market, which, he says, was already apparent in March 1991 when the
deal was agreed. Critics dispute this, adding that the price was too high.
But most of all, Mr Raingold's confidence in the scheme stems from his
belief in La Defense.
'La Defense is coming into another era,' he says. Originally, La Defense was
used for back offices, while headquarters remained in central Paris. 'The
quality of the early buildings left something to be desired,' he says.
Moreover, La Defense lacked prestige, adequate transport and proper shopping
facilities. 'Over 20 years, this has changed,' he says.
Today La Defense is the headquarters of France's largest companies, with
first-class communications, the architecturally-acclaimed Grande Arche and
France's largest shopping centre. Mr Raingold argues that the scheme is
significant because it is the first time that a building - the old Esso
headquarters - in La Defense will have been demolished. 'It is the begining
of a trend,' he says.
Mr Raingold's work in France began in the early 1970s, when he was managing
director of English and Continental Investments. When one of English and
Continental's owners sold up following the property collapse in the early
1970s, Mr Raingold set up GCI. Over the next few years while the French
market was in the doldrums, GCI concentrated on troubleshooting for UK
investors and property management.
In 1985, he returned to development, building an office project in the new
town of Marne La Vallee, in partnership with Mobax Securities. But he really
came to the public's attention in 1988, when a joint venture between GCI and
Heron International invested in Les Collines, a high-profile scheme next to
the La Defense arch. Like the Esso site, Les Collines attracted much
publicity, because of its size and prominence and the involvement of foreign
developers. The scheme was eventually judged a success and it was sold when
the market was at its peak.
Another prominent scheme undertaken by GCI, together with GA, a construction
company, is Roissypole, a business park at Charles de Gaulle airport. Mr
Raingold grandly dubs this office scheme - in which tenants can see aircraft
taxi past their window - 'an aero-city'. 'It was the first of its kind,' he
said. Continental Square, the first phase of the Roissypole project
comprises four buildings with a total area of 22,500 sq ft, half of which
has been let to tenants including Air France.
Although he believes the French market will remain difficult for the next
two years, he is optimistic about its future. 'With the opening of the east,
Europe's centre of gravity has moved,' he says.
Despite his obvious attachment to Paris, Mr Raingold has not turned his back
on the UK property market. Eighteen months ago, GCI opened an office in
London to look for property investments.
There have been, he says, many similarities in the development of the two
markets over the past 20 years. On occasion when the British have set a
trend, the French have followed.
But it is the differences that are more striking, particularly in terms of
planning and government intervention. In France, for example, tenants need
to win official approval before taking on large amounts of new space; in
Britain no such requirement is necessary.
At the same time, planning can be very restrictive in Paris - a policy that
often benefits developers by curbing oversupply. 'The French wanted to keep
central Paris as a city where people live. They took enormous pains to
respect the grey stone facades of the Haussmann buildings and not allow
skyrise buildings to ruin city life in Paris,' says Mr Raingold.
Living in Paris is an important ingredient in Mr Raingold's own assessment
of his success. Other British companies with developments in the city came
unstuck because they were based in the UK and delegated their overseas
operations to junior staff.
'The margin between success and failure is very narrow. If you are to be
successful in a European market you need a proper structure. It is no use
sending over a clerk, you need a heavyweight,' he says.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Westpac running out of time to
get its act together - The difficulties still facing the troubled Australian
bank after the latest upheavals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<TEXT>
WESTPAC, Australia's biggest bank, is not known for its sense of irony. But
there must have been a few wry grins in the bank's Sydney headquarters on
Wednesday when National Australia Bank (NAB) announced it had completed
precautionary checks on the books of Bank of New Zealand.
The announcement confirmed NAB will proceed with its proposed NZDollars
1.48bn (Dollars 796m) acquisition of BNZ, which will propel it past Westpac
as Australia's biggest bank in terms of global assets. Westpac directors,
meanwhile, were wondering how many of them would have to fall on their
swords to satisfy the markets' lust for boardroom blood.
Westpac has a special place in Australian banking history as the country's
oldest bank. But it has paid a heavier price than the other leading banks
for the ill-considered dash for growth in which they indulged in the mid to
late 1980s.
Westpac's problems came to a head in May, when it wrote off ADollars 2.65bn
(Dollars 1.91bn) against bad debts, of which ADollars 2.1bn reflected a
revaluation of its ADollars 6.3bn property portfolio. The write-offs left
the bank with pre-tax losses of ADollars 2.2bn for the six months to March,
compared with profits of ADollars 313m a year earlier.
Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, expected the substantial write-off to
ease investors' fears about Westpac's exposure to corporate failures and the
weak property market. At the same time, Mr Conroy sought to strengthen the
bank's balance sheet by raising ADollars 1.2bn through a 3-for-10 rights
issue at ADollars 3 per share.
However, the rights issue merely compounded Westpac's difficulties.
Executives watched in horror as the bank's share price slid from ADollars
3.87 on the day it was announced to ADollars 2.99 on the day it closed. Not
surprisingly, the issue fell ADollars 880m short of target after investors
took up rights to only 111m of 405m shares on offer, leaving CS First Boston
and its sub-underwriters to take up the shortfall.
On a wider front, Westpac has been taking a public relations beating as
Australian newspapers and television stations have relentlessly pursued
allegations of fraud by bank officials in connection with a controversial
foreign exchange loans scheme which left many borrowers heavily indebted
after the Australian dollar collapsed in the late 1980s.
Westpac strongly denies criminal activity by any of its staff in relation to
foreign loans. But the bank has also been identified by the New South Wales
Independent Commission Against Corruption as one of a number of banks and
insurance companies which illegally trafficked in confidential government
information on customers.
Against this background, Mr Conroy admitted earlier this week that the bank
was aware of concern among institutional investors about the composition of
the board. But until mid-morning yesterday, both Mr Conroy and Sir Eric
Neal, chairman, resolutely refused to say whether resignations could be
expected.
Sir Eric, deputy chairman since 1987 and chairman since 1990, was the main
target for a dissident shareholders' group led by Mr Gavin Solomon, a Sydney
solicitor, which has gained credibility as Westpac's problems have worsened.
The group also sought the departure of Sir Neil Currie, a director since
1987 and deputy chairman since 1991, and several other long-serving
directors. However, there was no pressure for the departure of Mr Conroy.
In the event, the board surprised the markets by announcing the resignation
of five directors, a third of the total, including both Sir Eric and Sir
Neil.
Westpac shares rose 1 cent on the announcement, to close at ADollars 2.86.
However, few observers expect a significant improvement in the short term
because of the large volume of shares overhanging the market and continuing
worries about the bank's exposure to the deteriorating commercial property
market.
Mr Conroy has forecast improved profits in the second half, and conceded
that the markets will need to see at least three successive good half-year
results from Westpac before the crisis of confidence in the bank can be said
to be over. However, analysts say there is still a chance that Westpac may
be forced into further large write-offs.
Mr Scott Hawker, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in Sydney, says: 'There is a
view emerging that while Westpac was conservative in May when it made those
big write-offs, market conditions have undoubtedly deteriorated since then.
'There is at least a chance (of further major write-offs) because they will
look very bad, having said they have taken all the pain, if ANZ or another
bank comes out with further write-offs. At the least, Westpac's solid level
of provisioning will have to continue. There is little room for them to cut
back.'
Mr John Uhrig, who replaces Sir Eric as chairman, had little to say about
future strategy yesterday, preferring to concentrate his fire on the media,
which many Westpac officials blame for precipitating the crisis. Mr Uhrig
also had no answer to awkward questions about why other long-serving
directors were remaining on the board.
However, Mr Uhrig has built a solid reputation as chairman of CRA, the
largely British-owned mining group, and the consensus among analysts was
that he and Mr Conroy should be able to convince investors that enough blood
has been shed to demonstrate the board's contrition for past mistakes.
That will not be good enough for Mr Solomon, who made clear that he would
continue his campaign for a vote on the continued incumbency of all
directors at the next annual meeting, due in January. However, he is
unlikely to persuade the institutions who own most of Westpac's shares to
support a further upheaval.
The only other bright spot for Westpac is that federal government
regulations prevent any other financial institution mounting a takeover
attempt to take advantage of its weakness. But that will change if, as
expected, the conservative opposition parties win the next federal election,
due by mid-1993.
If that happens, NAB may be sorely tempted to double its asset base by
bidding for its erstwhile big brother. Which gives Westpac about a year to
get its house in order.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Jardine group's Hong Kong
plodder takes a surprise step - The company that launched a dawn raid on
Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Land may be the plodder in Jardine's portfolio of Hong Kong-based
companies, but its capacity to surprise cannot be questioned.
In May, it stunned the colony's financial community when it sold one of its
prime office and retail properties to a group of mainland Chinese investors
for HKDollars 3.8bn (USDollars 492m).
The terms of the sale underlined what a superb deal it was. The Chinese
buyers paid HKDollars 400m up front, with the balance payable in three
instalments by March 1993. Until the last payment, Hongkong Land keeps
rental income from the property plus title.
The move hardly dented the company's hold on the best properties in the
central business district of Victoria Island - it still owns 4.9m square
feet of prime office and retail space - but it did lead property analysts to
re-rate the sector.
Most importantly, in light of yesterday's raid on Trafalgar House, it
promised to eradicate outstanding debt on Hongkong Land's balance sheet by
the end of 1993. The local financial community has been expecting the
company to use its virtually debt-free balance sheet to make a major
acquisition.
Given the nature of the company, the most talked of acquisitions were
properties in the portfolio of Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian
property company. This was given added credence by the presence of O&amp;Y
executives in Hong Kong in the past year.
Trafalgar House is well known to Jardine. Both companies operate a joint
venture civil engineering and construction company in the colony, Gammon.
Over the past year, however, there have been signs that Hongkong Land wanted
to diversify away from its core property, construction and management
business.
This year, it is leading a consortium of companies in bidding for the right
to develop the ninth container terminal at Kwai Chung, the colony's
state-of-the-art container port. The tilt at Trafalgar House is another sign
that Hongkong Land seeks a broader canvas.
But its bid to acquire 29.9 per cent of the UK builder will prompt a number
of concerns in Hong Kong.
Jardine led the exodus from Hong Kong in 1984 when it moved its domicile to
Bermuda and, more recently, pricked the thin skins of the establishment with
its unsuccessful attempt to escape the local regulatory environment for
London.
Yesterday's bid will reinforce local cynicism that this is another example
of a British Hong Kong company 'going home', like HSBC Holding's acquisition
of Midland Bank.
More seriously, those with a sense of history will remember that it was
Hongkong Land's diversification in the 1970s, together with the collapse in
property prices in Hong Kong in 1982-83, that nearly brought Jardine to its
knees.
The Keswick family's grasp on the empire was regained only after a major
restructuring of Hongkong Land which saw: the creation of a
separately-listed Dairy Farm, Mandarin Oriental; the sale of Hongkong
Electric - to Li Ka-shing - together with a fire sale of some of the
company's better residential holdings; and, the creation of Jardine Pacific
to hold the company's traditional trading businesses.
The difference this time is that in both its bid for a slice of Terminal 9
and its bid for a significant minority in Trafalgar House, the Keswicks are
not betting the empire. The Trafalgar investment represents around 9 per
cent of the company's net assets of HKDollars 34bn; its potential stake in
Terminal 9 a little less.
In both ventures the company is seeking board representation but not full
operational control.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Foster's price hits the lees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Foster's Brewing Group fell 12 cents to a seven-year low of
ADollars 1.16 in Sydney yesterday, just 6 cents above the striking price for
the group's ADollars 1bn (Dollars 713.2m) rights issue.
Foster's Brewing rights, which allow purchasers to buy one Foster's share at
ADollars 1.10, closed at 7.5 cents each after the first day of trading,
compared with a forecast range of between 10 and 12 cents.
Brokers said the market was nervous about the success of the issue because
of the failure last week of a fully-underwritten ADollars 1.2bn rights issue
by Westpac Banking Corporation, which was 72 per cent undersubscribed.
The weakness of the market was underlined on Wednesday when Industrial
Equity (IEL), part of the Adsteam group, said it had called off a proposed
ADollars 2bn flotation of its Woolworths retailing subsidiary.
Foster's is guaranteed a return of ADollars 1bn from its rights issue, which
is fully underwritten by Potter Warburg, the Australian investment bank, and
supported by Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP), Foster's main shareholder.
However, a substantial shortfall in subscriptions could make it more
difficult for other companies to find underwriting support for future
capital raisings.
Foster's, the world's fourth-largest brewing group, announced the issue two
weeks ago when it revealed a net loss of ADollars 950m for the 12 months to
the end of June.
The issue is designed to repair the group's balance sheet after hefty
write-offs against property, rural and financial assets, including a
ADollars 1.3bn write-off in 1991-92.
BHP recently took a 32 per cent shareholding in Foster's by buying most of
the stock held by International Brewing Holdings, a private company
controlled by Mr John Elliott, a former chairman and chief executive of
Foster's.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Credit Local lifts first-half
profit

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Locale de France, the bank specialising in local authority loans, has
lightened the gloom in the French financial sector by announcing an increase
in profits for the first half of the year.
Mr Pierre Richard, chairman, said Credit Locale, which saw net profits rise
by 6 per cent to FFr663.9m in the first half of this year over the same
period in 1991, had benefited from 'strong growth in activity despite the
difficult economic environment'.
The chairman anticipated further growth in the second half of the year, with
the final increase in net profits approaching the upper end of his original
forecast of 5 per cent to 10 per cent.
Credit Locale, which last autumn was the first candidate for the
government's partial privatisation programme, saw first-half net banking
income rise 20.8 per cent to FFr1.54bn. Gross operating profits were 16.4
per cent up at FFr1.27bn.

<TEXT>
IFIL, the listed holding company controlled by Italy's Agnelli family,
reported group pre-tax profits of L221bn (Dollars 178.4m) in the first half
of this year.
Ifil has not previously given a consolidated first-half profits figure.
Full-year group earnings in 1991 amounted to L180bn. At parent company
level, net first-half profits rose by 18.6 per cent to L58.7bn from L49.5bn.
The group's earnings were boosted by a L162bn one-off gain from selling 10
per cent of the Galbani foods group to BSN of France. Ifil sold the shares
in Galbani, in which it was formerly an equal partner with BSN, to the
French foods group, for around L300bn last June.
Stefanel, the Italian clothing group, reported a fall in first-half net
profits to L18.2bn, from L19.1bn in the same period in 1991. The decline
stemmed partly from lower extraordinary gains, which amounted to L5.6bn in
last year's first half.
Sales climbed by 10.4 per cent to L215.3bn, while operating earnings rose by
the same proportion to L22.2bn.

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S Saab Automobile expects no improvement this year on its 1991 result
when it made a pre-tax loss after financial items of SKr2.24bn (Dollars
422.6m).
The prediction follows a sharp deterioration in second-half trading
conditions and disappoints earlier expectations of a substantially reduced
1992 loss. In the first half, pre-tax losses after financial items narrowed
to SKr800m from SKr1.59bn in the same 1991 period.
The 1992 forecast was given by Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, who took over as
chief executive last month. He expects the group to remain in the red for at
least the first half of 1993, with prospects for the rest of next year
hinging on the launch of a new model, scheduled for introduction in the
third quarter of 1993.
'The next 12 months are going to be a very difficult time,' warned Mr
Butler-Wheelhouse.
The implication is that Saab, which is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and
General Motors of the US, could remain in the red for the whole of 1993,
which would be its fifth year of losses in a row.
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse said the second-half figures had worsened because of
lower sales, particularly in the key US, UK and Swedish markets, and reduced
margins.
The group originally hoped to sell 101,000 cars this year, but now fears it
may only sell 90,000, although this is still up on 1991's 87,500.
He said he aimed to reduce the group's break-even production level from
100,000 units to 70,000.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japanese banks meet capital
ratios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading banks heaved a collective sigh of relief yesterday as a
combination of slower asset growth, a stronger yen and higher stock prices
lifted them above an 8 per cent capital-to-assets ratio at the close of the
first half.
The 8 per cent figure is a virtual obsession for the banks, which have come
to regard the capital adequacy standards established by the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) as an important test of their soundness and
a serious matter of face.
Sakura Bank, which had been at 7.56 per cent last September, apparently
finished this September at around 8.2 per cent, due mostly to the surge in
stock prices that accompanied recent emergency economic measures.
Most other commercial banks are believed to have closed the half at above
8.5 per cent, while long-term credit banks, such as the Industrial Bank of
Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, were close to or above 9 per cent.
Official figures will be released in tandem with profit figures in coming
weeks.
Japanese banks are allowed to count some of their unrealised gains on stocks
as capital, but the weakness of stock prices this year had prompted them to
find other, sometimes cosmetic, means of improving their BIS ratios.
They increased subordinated loans from Japanese insurance companies, which
can also be counted as a form of capital, and they closely monitored the
growth of their assets. Regional banks, some of which have strong
capital-to-asset ratios, reported that commercial banks approached them
wanting to sell loans.
The regional Bank of Japan manager said it was sometimes unclear whether
these loans had been permanently sold or whether they had merely been
'parked' with the regional banks with a view to retrieving them later, if
stock prices improved. At the same time, Japanese banks have strictly
limited foreign lending activities.
Determination to improve BIS ratios comes in spite of the absence of
sanctions for banks that fail to meet the requirements next March. It would
be left to the Ministry of Finance to take action, and in these difficult
times the ministry would be unlikely to punish a deficient bank.
While the banks were happy yesterday that their ratios were above the
embarrassment threshold, they are concerned that stock prices again appear
to be drifting lower and that market turnover has been weak in recent days.
Mr Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, said that if
stock prices remain at 'these levels', with the Nikkei index at around
17,300, 'there will be no problem' next March.
He said leading Japanese banks were were not denying their customers loans,
as had been feared, but they were aware that the rapid growth of the 1980s
cannot could not be repeated in a mature banking market.
'We had 15 per cent growth for three or four years in a row. We can't do
that any more. For top banks, the figure will be 2 to 3 per cent from now
on,' Mr Kurosawa said.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Air France falls deeper in red
and cuts more jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE, the French state-owned carrier, yesterday provided the latest
sign of continued recession in the world airline industry by announcing
1,500 fresh job cuts and increased losses for the first half of the year.
The job cuts, to take place next year, come on top of 1,000 jobs shed last
year and the 2,500 already planned to go this year and in 1993.
Air France said it had to make these extra reductions because of
worse-than-expected first-half losses of FFr1.6bn (Dollars 310m), up from
FFr1.16bn in the same period of 1991 and a sharp reversal from the FFr477m
profit reported in last year's second half.
Mr Bernard Attali, the group chairman, said the cuts should restore Air
France to break-even by 1994. This is a year later than forecast earlier and
follows FFr1.4bn of losses over the past two years.
Like its international competitors, the group is fighting a price war,
especially on trans-Atlantic routes which represent 15 per cent of its
annual sales, in an attempt to increase its share of sluggish traffic.
It has responded by slashing costs, while attempting to maintain capacity,
which is why the latest job losses will be among ground staff.
By the end of next year, the Air France group, including its UTA long-haul
subsidiary, will have lost 5,000 of its 45,000 staff and trimmed FFr3bn from
its running costs. The latest cuts will reduce the general management staff
by 15 per cent.
Air France said it could not exclude redundancies, though staff being made
redundant would be offered retraining and a job elsewhere.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: CCF 11.4% ahead at halfway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Commercial de France (CCF), the large French bank, yesterday
confirmed it was considering the acquisition of Charterhouse, the UK
investment bank, and announced an increase in first-half net profits.
Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman, said CCF had achieved its 11.4 per cent
increase in net profits to FFr495m (Dollars 103.6m) in the first six months
of 1992 from FFr444.1m in the same period last year despite the 'difficult'
economic environment.
He attributed the bank's progress to 'prudent' provision policies and cost
control.
The announcement of CCF's profits growth comes at a time when other French
banks, notably Credit Lyonnais and Banque Indosuez, have been forced to make
steep increases in provisions because of the precarious state of the
property market and the rise in business failures.
CCF, like the rest of the French banking sector, has been steadily expanding
outside France to counter the competitive state of its domestic market.
The acquisition of Charterhouse, the investment banking subsidiary of the
Royal Bank of Scotland, could form part of that. Although Mr Pebereau said
yesterday that CCF's deliberations were at a 'preliminary stage'.
During the first half, CCF, which has positioned its retail banking
operations in France as a service-oriented network, saw net banking income
increase by 2.7 per cent to FFr4.05bn. Gross operating profits rose by 6.6
per cent to FFr1.21bn, mainly because the bank managed to restrict the
increase in costs to 1.1 per cent, below France's annual inflation rate of 3
per cent.
Credit Mutuel, another French bank, expects to produce static profits this
year, 3/32 according to Mr Etienne Pflimlin, chairman. In 1991 Credit Mutuel
made net profits of FFr1.33bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mosaic Investments, the West Midlands-based mini-conglomerate, adjourned its
annual meeting yesterday. It will resume when the company's discussions with
its bankers are concluded.
On Monday the company withdrew its final dividend and had its shares
suspended following a failure to agree borrowing facilities to allow it to
redeem Pounds 2.99m of convertible preference shares.
Mosaic said the issues raised by the announcement would make it difficult
for shareholders to decide how to vote on the AGM resolutions. And many
would have sent off their proxy votes before the announcement.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Increased losses at Waverley Cameron
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An inadequacy of working capital following a substantial reduction in its
banking facilities was cited by Waverley Cameron as the reason for heavy
trading losses in the year to end-March.
The net loss before tax of this office equipment and stationery group grew
to Pounds 1.43m, against Pounds 617,000 last time. Turnover fell from Pounds
45.9m to Pounds 26.9m and losses per share increased from 1.56p to 2.32p.
Again there is no dividend.
The company said that the withdrawal of its banking facilities had left it
with no option other than to cease trading in its BTS subsidiary, which has
since been placed in administrative receivership by its bank.
Also, in order to ensure continuation of facilities for the remainder of the
group, Partners, its stationery retailing subsidiary, had been sold for
Pounds 2.2m and RMG, which covered the office products side, was sold for
about Pounds 2.9m. This disposal was largely responsible for an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 5.15m.
Having completed these two disposals the directors intend to concentrate on
developing the group's building and property activities.

Lower oil prices left net profits at Pict Petroleum down 36 per cent in the
year to June 30.
Profits were Pounds 2.96m (Pounds 4.63m) on lower turnover of Pounds 10.8m,
against Pounds 12.5m. The result was helped by a turnround from net interest
costs of Pounds 214,000 to income received of Pounds 536,000.
Earnings per share were 6.65p (12.56p) after taking account of last year's
Pounds 12m rights issue.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Depressed residential sales, with lower volume and reduced margins,
contributed to pre-tax profits being halved from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds
1.58m at Asda Property Holdings in the first half of 1992.
Turnover, which fell to Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 21.7m), mainly comprised Pounds
11.4m (Pounds 14.7m) in income from sales of trading properties and a 10 per
cent increase in gross rental income to Pounds 7.12m (Pounds 6.49m).
Mr Emanuel Davidson, chairman, said the nature of the company's business
would change materially following the disposal of most of its tenanted
residential portfolio to the Bradford Property Trust in July. The Pounds 36m
proceeds were used to reduce net borrowings.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.2p (3.4p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 0.65p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at Palmerston Holdings, the property investor, increased from
Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 5.46m in the year to March 31.
The company blamed exceptional charges of Pounds 6.17m, relating to
associate companies.
The charges included Pounds 4.22m relating to the company's share of the
revaluation reserve deficits from associates. The final dividend is passed
leaving the total at 0.5p (1.75p).
The company is to concentrate on expanding its residential portfolio and the
retention of commercial property which provides secure long-term rental. As
part of this strategy the investments in associates will be realised.
The continuing downturn in the commercial market resulted in net asset value
falling over the year from 229p to 121p.
Before exceptionals there was a profit of Pounds 709,000 (Pounds 2.68m loss)
helped by higher rents and charges of Pounds 9.57m (Pounds 8.7m) and a
surplus on property disposals of Pounds 5.62m (Pounds 3.67m). Losses per
share were 19.4p (12.4p).

Malaya Group, the loss-making Mercedes-Benz dealer which recently came under
the control of Lancaster Associates Holdings, yesterday reported pre-tax
losses of Pounds 160,000 for the first half of 1992.
Mr Keith Goldie-Morrison, chairman of the USM-quoted group, said the holding
costs of its Billinghurst dealership and the recession had prevented any
significant recovery from the Pounds 259,000 deficit last time.
Sales rose to Pounds 3.65m (Pounds 3.4m). Operating profit of Pounds 14,600
compared with losses of Pounds 50,000 and interest payable took Pounds
174,600 (Pounds 209,000).
Lancaster gained control of Malaya and injected Pounds 3m in new capital
under a rights issue in August.

Pre-tax profits at A Beckman fell by almost 18 per cent, from Pounds 1.1m to
Pounds 903,000, in the year to June 30. Turnover slipped by Pounds 580,000
to Pounds 10.8m.
The company said conditions in the textile division continued to be
difficult, but it remained profitable.
Stock levels, debtors and overheads continued to be controlled.
In the property division, the company's investment portfolio was almost
fully let, with interest payable more than covered by rental income.
A revaluation of investment properties, coupled with the downward
revaluation of assets, reduced the revaluation reserve to a little less than
Pounds 2.7m.
Earnings per share emerged at 5.2p (6.4p). A same-again final dividend of
3.15p is recommended, maintaining the total at 4.78p.

Densitron International, the electronic components maker, returned to

The improved figures resulted from strong sales into Asia by the Japanese

An extraordinary charge of Pounds 5.94m mainly represented further losses on

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: OFT approves revision of Allied beer deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS has secured approval from the Office of Fair Trading for a
revised beer supply agreement with Pubmaster, the Brent Walker retail arm.
The original seven year supply contract, agreed in November last year, has
been reduced to three years; the minimum amount of beer that Pubmaster is
obliged to buy has been cut by about half to 100,000 barrels a year.
As a result of the revision, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the OFT's director general,
confirmed that the 734 pubs which Allied has leased to Pubmaster would be
considered free of tied beer supplies.
Because the original agreement required Pubmaster to buy half its beer from
Allied, the OFT had previously refused to include the leased pubs among the
2,380 outlets which Allied has to free from the tie to meet the requirements
of the government's beer orders.
Pubmaster will now be obliged to take no more than a quarter of its beer
supplies from Allied, but with Allied's Tetley ale and Castlemaine lager
being made available throughout Pubmaster's 1,983 pubs, it is expected to
continue to buy well in excess of that amount.
Both Allied and Pubmaster may terminate the new agreement by giving nine
months' notice any time after Sep-tember 30 1995. If Allied ends the
agreement, however, Pubmaster has an option to revert to the terms of the
original supply agreement until 2002.
Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Allied's brewing division, said yesterday: 'We are
pleased to have settled matters with the OFT and we are confident that the
deal will enable both parties to continue to operate effectively in the
changing market place.'
Mr John Brackenbury, chairman of Pubmaster, welcomed the deal as ' an
important precedent for the beer industry.'
He added:' We wanted a supply agreement with Allied as part of our
commitment to extending consumer choice. We are taking a wide range of ales
and lagers from a cross-section of national and regional suppliers.'

THE BATTLE for market share in Ireland's IPounds 300m (Pounds 320m)
pharmaceutical distribution industry took a new turn yesterday, when AAH
Holdings made a cash and shares offer for Cahill May Roberts Group.
The offer, on a 10-for-51 basis, is being recommended by CMRG's board and
values Ireland's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler at IPounds 24.9m,
representing a 70 per cent premium over its last traded price of 55p on the
Dublin USM.
There is a partial cash alternative of 87p a share.
By yesterday evening, a pre-condition of the offer, that directors of CMRG
and their families, and Allied Combined Trust, which together hold 54 per
cent of the ordinary share capital, accept irrevocably, had been met.
AAH is the UK's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler with annual turnover in
excess of Pounds 1.3bn. It has wholesale and franchised retail activities in
Northern Ireland.
The offer has been triggered by merger talks which began last month between
United Drug, another pharmaceutical wholesaler in the Republic, and Alchem
in Northern Ireland, which would result in a group with a combined turnover
of IPounds 110m. CMRG reported turnover of IPounds 90m in 1991.
Mr Bill Pybus, AAH chairman, said: 'We have been interested in CMRG for some
time, but when United Drug decided to merge with Alchem we decided to go
ahead with an offer.'
Last year, United Drug was awarded the franchise for AAH's Vantage retail
activity for the Republic, so its Alchem merger plan would put it into
direct competition with AAH's own business in Northern Ireland. CMRG is now
likely to take over the Vantage franchise in the Republic.

ASDA, the Leeds-based grocery retailer, has sold two development sites and

The disposals appear to be a reversal of the company's previously-stated
policy. When Mr Patrick Gillam took over as chairman last year he stressed
that he would not sell the company's 'seedcorn' sites to its rivals, in
spite of its desperate need for cash.
Yesterday Asda emphasised that the deal was a one-off and said it had
neither the 'need nor the intention to sell other successful stores'.
It added: 'We were offered a very full price and it was clearly in
shareholders' interests to sell them.'
Although Asda has traded poorly in recent years there are indications that
it is beginning to recover lost ground.
The company delivered an upbeat statement about current trading at its
recent annual meeting and the company's share price has begun to pick up as
analysts scent a recovery story.
'Their like-for-like sales are currently outperforming the industry average
and are far better than expected,' said Mr Philip Dorgan, food retailing
analyst at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank.
This week the company opened its second Dales discount store at Tipton in
the West Midlands and has also recently opened the first of a revised format
Asda store concentrating on fresh foods at Stoke.
'We are modestly encouraged by the progress we have made so far as part of
our three year recovery strategy,' Asda said yesterday.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cautious approach improves City's view -
TI's Pounds 87m charge for Dowty was well within expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TOOK some time to come and an attack of pessimism early this week knocked
10 per cent off the share price, but when TI finally released details
yesterday of the provisions related to its June acquisition of aerospace
group Dowty, the market heaved a huge sigh of relief.
Coming after rumours of up to Pounds 150m of provisions and TI's 1990 run-in
with the City over acquisition accounting, the Pounds 87.1m figure was
modest.
Even taking into account the Pounds 25m write-off on the closure of the
Cognito paging business, taken in Dowty's last accounts, the provisions
appear to be well within market expectations.
What is more, TI appears to have been scrupulous about keeping in line with
the Accounting Standards Board guidelines of accepted practice - not
surprisingly perhaps as Mr Michael Garner, the finance director, is on the
ASB.
Having taken a long look at Dowty, TI has produced a remarkably detailed
breakdown of the fair value adjustments.
'I have never seen that level of disclosure by a company,' said Mr Sandy
Morris, analyst at County NatWest. 'TI has set the standard today.'
TI's provisions fall into two parts - Pounds 49.7m of reorganisation costs
and the balance covering asset value adjustments, changes in accounting
policies and items such as investment in improving environmental controls.
It has also said that there will be no more provisions related to the Dowty
acquisition - in 1990 TI was pilloried in the City for taking a 'second
bite' of provisions relating to acquisitions made in 1988.
The group has also said that it will use the provisions within two years and
all items not required will be released directly back to the balance sheet
and not pushed through the profit and loss account, thereby boosting
earnings.
The biggest single item in the reorganisation is a Pounds 33.8m charge for
rationalisation.
Some Pounds 6m of this will be used to reverse some of the recent
diversification at Dowty's Singapore operations. The second phase of
reorganising Dowty's Gloucester sites will cost Pounds 5m and another Pounds
7m is allocated to cover integration of TI's Crane, the engineering seals
business, with Dowty's polymer division.
Also within the rationalisation category is a Pounds 4m charge for
relocating the electronic systems business. And Pounds 6m has been set aside
to cover the run-down of Dowty's group and divisional headquarters, its
London headquarters and for the amalgamation of offices in Washington.
Another Pounds 7.7m covers financial reorganisation. This covers
harmonisation of the two groups' taxes, integrating the treasury operations
 -including reversing currency and interest rate hedges and modifying bank
facilities - and bringing Dowty's financial control systems up to what TI
says is a superior standard. Some Pounds 8m will cover redundancies in
Dowty's main board, at the headquarters and the closure of some group
services.
Many of the other fair value adjustments sprang from what TI describes as
'less than conservative accounting.' According to TI, Dowty had to do more
than just avoid the negative impact of provisions on earnings. 'They were up
against banking covenants, so they had to have one eye out for net
shareholders' funds as well,' Mr Garner says.
Most controversial will be Dowty's loss-making contracts. Some Pounds 12m
covers what TI believes will be losses on contracts over the next two years.
TI says Dowty had been providing for losses only on those orders covering
customers' immediate needs, a treatment that was insufficiently prudent.
TI is also taking a more conservative view of Dowty's stocks. It is writing
off Pounds 6m of 'surplus spares' which will be scrapped, but has left on
the books any spares where there is a realistic expectation of a sale,
however distant. There is also the write-off of certain receivables,
bringing the current assets adjustment to Pounds 11.9m.
A further Pounds 4.1m comes under the category of 'accounting polices' where
TI and its auditors, Price Waterhouse, disagree with Dowty and Arthur
Andersen over matters such as the period of depreciating assets like
computers and when profits should be taken during the life of long-term
contracts.
Mr Garner says that in some instances - in the Marine division, for example
 -Dowty was not even following its own policies on profit taking. Profits
were booked the moment that material hit the shop floor.
Yesterday's announcement is notable on two counts. In the first place,
analysts appear to believe that the Pounds 87.1m is both reasonable and
within expectations.
But, by supplying such detailed explanation, TI may more importantly have
laid the ghost of its fracas with the City over acquisition accounting.
TI now has a much clearer run at trying to prove what it has always believed
to be the case; that it is building value in its business through good
management rather than through clever accounting.

<TEXT>
INNTREPRENEUR Estates, the Grand Metropolitan and Courage pubs joint
venture, is discussing the sale of 1,250 pubs, worth an estimated Pounds
250m, with a number of potential buyers, writes Philip Rawstorne.
A management team from Inntrepreneur is understood to be one of the
interested parties but no confirmation was forthcoming yesterday.
The pubs, which Inntrepreneur must free from tied beer supplies to meet
government orders, may be sold as one block or in several large packages.
Tenants and lessees of the pubs likely to be affected have been informed,
GrandMet said yesterday.
Following the sale, Inntrepreneur will be left with 4,350 pubs, taking their
beer supplies from Courage.
Of its initial 7,350 pubs, 500 have already been sold, 700 leased free of
tie, and 550 transferred to GrandMet's Chef &amp; Brewer estate.

<TEXT>
A GROUP of dissident shareholders in Harmony Leisure, the loss-making pubs
and restaurant group, yesterday announced moves to oust the board at an
extraordinary meeting.
The rebel group, led by Mr Andrew Martyr, a former hotel executive, claims
that more than 30 per cent of shareholders back their call for an EGM.
Mr Martyr has told shareholders that the dissidents, if elected, would
return Harmony to profit and raise capital to expand the chain of 23 pubs
and restaurants.
The USM-quoted company lost Pounds 1.04m in the year to March 31 1991 and
Pounds 445,000 in the following six months.
It said yesterday that its 1991-92 results, due earlier this week, would be
released on Tuesday and an annual meeting would be held next month.
Mr Martyr's team includes Mr Simon Lynch, formerly with Grand Metropolitan;
Mr Ronald Laden, former chairman of Quaker Oats (Europe); and Mr Simon
Smith, a London solicitor.
Since announcing their challenge last month, the rebels have acquired
520,000 shares, 2 per cent of Harmony's capital.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Overseas boost for Redland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Redland, one of Britain's biggest building materials
group jumped by 12 per cent to Pounds 88.5m in the first six months of this
year.
Mr Robert Napier, managing director, said that the severe downturn in the UK
construction market had been offset by strong trading in Germany and
improvements in other overseas markets.
The results were assisted by a Pounds 15m contribution from Steetley, the UK
building materials group acquired by Redland earlier this year.
The interim dividend is maintained at 8.25p. Earnings per share fell from
13.1p to 11.6p after taking account of shares issued for Steetley and
increased minorities of Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 11m), mostly in Germany.
Redland estimated it would achieve savings of Pounds 30m a year by
integrating Steetley. Since the purchase the UK aggregate and brick
businesses had been merged, Steetley's headquarters closed and two French
businesses merged resulting in 800 job losses.
Mr Napier said that trading had been excellent in Germany where the group
has a 51 per cent stake in Braas the country's biggest roof tile maker.
Eastern Germany was benefiting from investment in improved housing. The
housing market had also remained buoyant in western Germany. Overall German
profits rose by a quarter to Pounds 41.1m.
Redland's share price fell 19p to 343p yesterday on fears that growth in
German construction may slow next year while the UK market is expected to
remain severely depressed.
Profits from other continental European countries also rose sharply during
the first half from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 20.9m.
The group said that it was working hard to bring Steetley's French
aggregates businesses under control with volumes and profits lower than
during the corresponding period last year. Steetley's Spanish profits were
also lower due to a slow down in the Madrid construction market.
The UK market is where Redland has been hit hardest with sales and prices of
many of its products sharply lower. Without the contribution from Steetley,
UK profits would have seen a big fall. As it was the decline was restricted
to just Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 19.5m.
Mr Napier said: 'In the UK prospects for the rest of the year remain poor
although the restructuring of the Redland and Steetley aggregates and brick
businesses will provide further opportunities for cost savings. In Germany,
trading continues to be strong and the outlook remains good.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Alexon profits downgraded following stock
hangover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SALES fall of about 10 per cent in Alexon Group's main brands cut pre-tax
profits by 46 per cent in the six months to July 25.
The slide from Pounds 3.82m to Pounds 2.08m followed a 7 per cent decline in
turnover to Pounds 48.7m from Pounds 52.5m (or Pounds 56.1m including
discontinued activities). Sales in the south-east were particularly poor.
And there was further bad news in that Mr Lawrence Snyder, chairman, said
unsold stock from the spring and summer - in spite of extending the sale
through August - would probably lead to a write-off at the end of the year.
The shortfall on expected sales was about Pounds 4m.
Analysts typically downgraded profit forecasts by Pounds 1.5m to take
account of this.
The share price shed 18p to close at 180p, compared with 444p in September
last year, not long after the retail group demerged from Claremont Garments
(Holdings), the Marks and Spencer supplier.
Ms Ruth Henderson, chief executive, said Alexon ladieswear had performed the
worst with a like-for-like sales fall of more than 10 per cent. Dash
leisurewear was down by nearly 10 per cent.
Eastex, aimed at the older, shorter woman and relaunched early last year,
had gained 10 per cent and was now approaching a quarter of the business.
The three brands had got off to a good start with their autumn ranges.
However, Mr Snyder pointed out that the comparison was against a dreadful
September 1991.
He was in mea culpa mood, saying the group had got 'an awful lot wrong' in
the past couple of years. The group had survived the early part of the
recession relatively unscathed and its ranges had not been 'as fashionable
as they should have been'. In Dash it had had to broaden the product range
considerably to tackle the problem of copying.
He said the stock problem should not recur because the group had ceased to
commission so much in advance.
Interest payments amounted to Pounds 803,000 (Pounds 557,000) and the
average overdraft was about Pounds 14m.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 4.39p (7.66p). The interim dividend
is held at 3p.
COMMENT
Alexon annoyed analysts six months ago with an unexpected Pounds 400,000
pension cushion for its profits, and it has annoyed them again with the
stock hangover. This is enough to set hands wringing over the management's
credibility. However, the past year's disappointment ought to be seen
against a good record over the previous eight years, especially in building
up Dash and reviving Eastex since their acquisition in 1988. Much effort has
been put into revitalising the products and the group has traditionally been
tight on costs. There is no denying that the stock mistake was a big one -
and showed that the management had got blase about sales. The lesson seems
to have been learnt. A pre-tax forecast of Pounds 7.5m gives a prospective
p/e of 12.5. This is at a discount to the stores sector, which it has
underperformed by about 60 per cent in the past 12 months. Considering its
long-term recovery prospects, it looks cheap and is supported by a yield of
nearly 8 per cent.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Time Products records 28% improvement to
Pounds 3.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTON MORAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRST-TIME contribution from its Apollo strap business, savings on the
discontinued Hong Kong operations and an exceptional gain on sale of
investment properties pushed up interim profits at Time Products, the watch
and jewellery distribution group.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 rose by 28 per cent from
Pounds 3.04m to Pounds 3.9m. Trading profit increased sharply to Pounds 2.2m
(Pounds 1.33m) on increased sales of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 19.4). Earnings
jumped 33 per cent to 5.33p (4.02p).
Mr Leslie Michaels, finance director, said a Pounds 300,000 contribution to
trading profit from the Apollo strap business, acquired last October for
Pounds 6m, was effectively profit-neutral because of financing costs
involved in the purchase.
Trading profit was also boosted by the exclusion of losses from Remex, the
Hong Kong manufacturing subsidiary, the closure costs of which have already
been provided for. Trading losses at Remex in the first-half last year
amounted to about Pounds 400,000.
Mr Marcus Margulies, chairman, said the results were satisfactory in
difficult economic conditions.
Although the immediate economic prospects remain uncertain, he said, the
company was in a fortunate position with strong brands, a healthy balance
sheet and experienced management.
Increased sales of luxury watches contributed to the rise in turnover,
although sales from the volume watch division were down. The exclusion of
about Pounds 6m turnover from Remex was partially replaced by sales of about
Pounds 5m from Apollo.
A Pounds 612,000 exceptional gain came from disposal of three floors of
office space at the Remex Centre in Hong Kong, where the company still holds
another eight floors.
Finance income fell 24 per cent to Pounds 1.09m on lower interest rates and
costs incurred in the acquisition of Apollo.
An increased interim dividend of 2.75p (2.65p) is declared.

The Takeover Panel yesterday cleared a bid by Abbot Holdings for Blystad
Group of any breach of its code.
Three directors of Blystad, which is involved in oil services, had
complained that there had been an arrangement between Abbot and the three
Blystad brothers, who own 65 per cent of the target.
It was alleged that Abbot had agreed not to try to recover immediately a
loan of about Pounds 2m to a company in which the Blystads were interested
in return for their acceptance of the Pounds 7.5m paper bid.
An offer document is now expected. The directors who are not part of the
Blystad family oppose the offer.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Frogmore Estates ahead 36% after fall in
property provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROGMORE ESTATES, the property company, yesterday announced a 36 per cent
pre-tax profits increase, from Pounds 7.11m to Pounds 9.7m, in the year to
June 30.
With turnover down at Pounds 41.7m (Pounds 47.6m), the pre-tax rise was
struck after a sharp fall to Pounds 815,000 (Pounds 2.26m) in provisions
needed to reduce the cost of trading properties, litigation costs of Pounds
1.42m (Pounds 525,000) over the 1986 acquisition of Land Investors by BCPH,
and interest charges lower at Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 3.2m).
Breaking out the pre-tax figure further, profits on ordinary activities,
including rents and trading, more than doubled from Pounds 4m to Pounds
9.89m, while losses from the sale of investment properties amounted to
Pounds 195,000 (profits Pounds 3.1m).
Mr Dennis Cope, chairman, said that the advance in the contracted rent roll,
from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 18.2m, came mainly from acquisitions, rent
reviews and new lettings.
Year-end borrowings totalled Pounds 45.8m, giving gearing of 28 per cent:
this contrasted with Pounds 7m at the end of December.
However, Mr Cope said: 'The board will continue to proceed with extreme
caution in this unprecedented financial turmoil'.
The company continued to expand its joint venture housing activity north of
London and within the M25 semi-circle with housing companies Fairview and
Rialto as partners. Profits of Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 1.8m) were made and 395
(160) dwellings sold, mainly to first-time buyers.
The final dividend is lifted by 1p to 11.6p, giving a total of 15p (13.8p),
payable from earnings on ordinary activities of 16.4p (7.2p).

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker aided by low interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORNWELL PARKER, the furniture and fabrics group, lifted annual profits by
2.6 per cent despite a decline in turnover caused by what Mr Martin Jourdan,
chairman, described as 'the lowest demand for many years.'
Pre-tax profits in the year to July 31 increased to Pounds 8.26m (Pounds
8.05m) helped by a sharp reduction in net interest payments to Pounds 29,000
(Pounds 543,000).
Although turnover slipped by 3 per cent to Pounds 90m (Pounds 92.8m) in
'extremely difficult market conditions', Mr Jourdan said about a third of
sales came from new products successfully introduced in the last two years.
These products, in both the furniture and fabrics divisions, combined with
'stringent management controls' and further cost reductions, helped maintain
operating margins at over 9 per cent.
Overall trading profits slipped to Pounds 8.29m (Pounds 8.59m) with most of
the decline coming in the furniture division which bore the Pounds 250,000
costs of a management consultancy report on the Nathan Furniture business.
Trading profits in the furniture division fell by 5 per cent to Pounds 5.37m
(Pounds 5.65m) on turnover down 4.1 per cent to Pounds 55.8m (Pounds 58.2m).
However, the division, led by Parker Knoll which increased profits for the
seventh successive year, was able to increase market share and maintain
operating margins.
The fabrics division posted trading profits of Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 2.94m)
on turnover of Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 34.6m) and was also able to finance the
launch of new ranges and brands 'invaluable in the fight for increased
market share.' After the end of the financial year the group bought Fardis
from Osborne &amp; Little to strengthen its position in the French fabrics
market.
Earnings per share rose to 13.3p (13.2p); the final dividend goes up to 4p
making a total of 5.7p (5.5p).
COMMENT
During the recession the management has wisely focused on reducing working
capital, cutting costs and improving productivity, while still funding the
launch of a stream of new products. Once the upturn comes, Cornwell Parker
will be among the first to benefit, but with neither the housing market nor
high street spending showing any real signs of a pick-up, it is stuck in a
holding pattern. The share price peaked at 239p the end of May, but the
long-awaited recovery failed to materialise and it has since sunk to 188p.
With pre-tax profits expected to total about Pounds 8.75m this year, and
earnings per share of perhaps 14p, the shares are trading on a prospective
p/e of 13.4 and look like a reasonably cheap buy for the optimist.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Property Trust calls for Pounds 2.6m as
losses slow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Property Trust reported sharply increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 7.95m
for the year to March 31, against Pounds 3.14m previously.
The results, which reflected a slowing of losses in the second half, after a
deficit of Pounds 6.32m in the first six months, were accompanied by a
proposed Pounds 2.6m rights issue.
The group, which reorganised its capital earlier this year, also confirmed
its move to the main market.
It yesterday forecast that, subject to the completion of a property sale,
pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 would not be less than
Pounds 400,000.
In the 12 months under review, turnover rose sharply to Pounds 9.52m (Pounds
1.32m) but cost of sales took Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 285,000) and provisions
for lower property values came to Pounds 2.36m (Pounds 1.3m).
An exceptional charge of Pounds 1.75m comprised Pounds 695,000 written off
an investment property and Pounds 1.06m against other investments and loans.
Losses per share jumped to 104.7p (56.3p). An extraordinary charge of Pounds
78,000 related to costs of the capital restructuring.
Shareholders will be offered three new shares for every two held, at 25p
apiece. Payment is in two instalments, with 10p due on acceptance and the
balance by next March.
The shares fell 1p to 21p yesterday.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Kleinwort to take advantage of economic
reform in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson Investment Management has raised Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.7m)
for a closed-end fund investing mainly in unlisted Chinese companies.
The London-listed fund will take minority stakes, averaging about Dollars
5m, in existing profitable companies which aim to obtain a stock market
listing within a few years. Typically, the companies would be rural or
township enterprises set up by local communities.
The companies would generally be involved in exports, though the fund was
also attracted by the rise in Chinese consumer spending, with foreign
investment in retailing recently permitted. Companies which earned domestic
currency can swap it into foreign exchange.
Mr Robin Fox, chairman of the fund and vice chairman of the Kleinwort Benson
group, said the stakes would be of 25 per cent or more because enterprises
obtaining this level of foreign investment obtained significant tax
advantages - usually a three-year tax holiday and a further period of
reduced tax.
The fund, to be managed from Hong Kong by Mr Andrew Taylor, aims to take
advantage of economic reform in China, which took off again this year and
has boosted the types of enterprises in which it plans to invest.
Mr Fox said the best value was to be found in unlisted companies rather than
on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets, which were showing signs of
'indigestion' after their hectic rise earlier this year.
The fund's managers will be advised by CIEC Investment Advisers, a
subsidiary of Citic, a leading Chinese financial institution. CIEC is, Mr
Fox said, the only Chinese-owned accountancy firm which was allowed to
prepare companies for stock market listing. Lack of adequate accounting
standards has been a problem for investors in China.
The fund expects not to pay a dividend in the first year, but to do so
thereafter. Half of the Dollars 60m is to be paid up and the remainder will
be called when the first tranche is 75 per cent invested. Up to 25 per cent
of the money may be invested in listed stocks in Hong Kong and China and in
Chinese companies outside China.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Arts: Heady world of Matisse - Marina Vaizey reviews a once
in a lifetime exhibition in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARINA VAIZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henri Matisse and America have had a long love affair, culminating now in
the largest exhibition accorded his art, at the Museum of Modern Art, New
York, until January 12. This compilation, three years in the making and a
decade in the thinking, has cost more than Dollars 4m and is sponsored by
Philip Morris. The show brings together well over 400 paintings, sculptures,
drawings, printed books and the fabled paper cut-outs of his last years,
drawn from the collections, public and private, of western Europe, America
and - notably - Russia.
MOMA itself has the largest collection of work in both breadth and depth by
Matisse owned by a single museum. With this exhibition, more than a fifth of
his known paintings are on view, with an even higher proportion of
masterpieces. So far so huge. MOMA first held a major exhibition of Matisse
in 1931 and in the past three decades there has been show after show.
Matisse opened the Hayward in 1968; his centenary was celebrated in Paris at
the Grand Palais; and there have been shows devoted to Matisse in Morocco
and in Nice. The cut-outs, the illustrated books, the drawings, the prints,
the sculpture: Matisse was staggeringly prolific in a variety of media. In
France there are two Musees Matisse, not to mention a masterpiece of living
art, the chapel of the Rosary at Vence.
This exhibition is guided by a compelling chronology and a sense of subtle
drama which highlights the exuberance of its subject. The scene is set by
his first markedly undistinguished paintings, dogged and determined student
work, copies and exercises, dour and even sour still lifes, and very rare,
unpeopled empty seascapes, almost expressionist: all very northern European.
The emergence of colour, glorious colour, banishes the sludge forever,
travelling towards the 'kind of paradise' he declared as his intended
destination, and during the journey borrowing from whatever artist had
something to show and teach: Cezanne, Seurat, the impressionists, the post
impressionists - not to mention the old masters, as far back as the frescoes
of Giotto, and his own peers. Moreover, the graceful decorative devices of
Islamic art, absorbed in his visit to the great Islamic show in Munich in
1910 and his trips to North Africa, also infused and enthused his art.
In the process Matisse transformed traditional notions of pictorial space,
flattening perspective, ignoring proportions and creating a heady
imaginative world in which odalisques floated in rooms filled with hectic
patterns which are nevertheless oddly serene; gigantic nudes appear as
dancing figures in endless vistas of land and sky , or gigantic hieratic
totems in vast forests. Nudes and portraits are distorted, even grotesque,
stylised and refined: a face is distilled into a coloured oval with lines
for eyes and mouth. Colour is unmodulated: cool pink, sizzling orange,
light-filled blue, bright green and deep red are flung together in
incandescent combinations.
Some of the famous photographs of the bearded Matisse in his white painting
coat, like a surgeon, surrounded by the most opulent of objects, the most
desirable of patterns, the most glorious of women, are used to introduce the
exhibition. These photographs tell us that the painter of pleasure was a
difficult and complex character, his passionate art achieved almost with
dispassion. The show rightly provides just enough information to tell us
where we are in Matisse's career, in terms of the geographical and
chronological setting, and his preoccupations; we are asked to look afresh
at the familiar and the unfamiliar.
Thus, MOMA's own large-scale masterpieces, such as 'The Red Studio' (1911)
and 'The Moroccans', (1915-1916) are amplified by 'Harmony in Red' (1908)
from the Hermitage. 'Luxe, calme et volupte' (1904-5) both study and final
painting, and the oil sketch for le 'Bonheur de Vivre', (1905-6), transform
the pastoral into compositions of shimmering colour like a series of beaded
curtains, semi-translucent.
From there to the sophisticated, intensely decorative, and profoundly
euphoric set pieces like 'La Danse' and the other enigmatic figure pieces,
is apparently an enormous change. But what the exhibition perhaps makes
clearer than ever before is that all is theme and variation. However visibly
different, the subject matter is consistent, and the formal preoccupations
and innovations are too: the flattening of space, which paradoxically makes
for a sense of limitless space, as well as inducing, particularly in
domestic interiors, a sense of claustrophobia that is at times almost
stifling, is as apparent in the late cut-outs as in 'Tea in the Garden'
(1919); 'La Danse' (1909) prefigures 'The Swimming Pool' (1952), room sized
cut outs in which the white spaces between are as significant as the
swooping, flying blue figures of the swimmers. The scale of the exhibition
lets us see, in a once-in-a-lifetime show, the narrative of his achievement
as fully as possible.
It is the alliance between visual wit and sensuality that makes Matisse so
captivating. He created his art, so lush, even over the top, with an
uncompromising severity and gravity. Dignity is everywhere, as is a sense,
often, of an unbridled joy. Matisse said he wanted 'to reach that state of
condensation of sensation which constitutes a picture'; but finally, he
simply pointed out that 'a painter's best spokesman is his work'. So far so
great.
The exhibition continues at the Museum of Modern Art, New York until January
12 1993. (Next spring the Pompidou in Paris will have a more precisely
focussed exhibition of works between 1904-1917.) 'Henri Matisse: A
Retrospective' by John Elderfield (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 48) is an
outstanding contribution to the study of the artist and his period and
reproduces everything in the exhibition, as well as complementary
illustrations.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Arts: Women on the college walls - Artists brighten up New
Hall, Cambridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FAITH GLASGOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few who have dined in an Oxbridge college beneath the fearsome and dyspeptic
stares of several centuries' ranked portraiture, mostly of college
dignitaries, will have been particularly uplifted by the experience. Most of
the pictures are cross-looking, blackened and dingy. Almost all are of and
by men.
But fix an invitation to lunch at the women's college of New Hall in
Cambridge, and a vary different scenario awaits.
For a start, on your way to the dining hall you will pass a waist-high pink
saucepan in the grounds. It is made by Judith Cowan, and is one of more than
70 pieces of 20th century art by distinguished women artists which now
enliven the austere geometry of the college.
The domed dining hall itself is a dramatic backdrop for works by Mary Kelly,
Sophie Ryder and Vivien Blackett, among others. In the recess behind the low
stage, Evelyn Williams' painted relief of an anguished woman lying awake in
a bed, 'All Night Through', looks like a large ivory altar to the trials of
womanhood.
What is going on? A year ago, the college walls were bare, except for a few
pieces of work on loan (all of which were by men). In a move not only to
brighten the place up but to present a positive image of it as a women's
college, the college decided to approach leading women artists around the
country and ask them to donate a piece of work.
The response was massive. Christopher Stevenson, the bursar, estimated that
there was a five per cent refusal rate 'and some of those were our fault
because we sent the letters to the wrong addresses'.
Maggi Hambling was one of the earliest to commit herself. Her painting 'Gulf
Women Prepare for War' was not done specifically for the college, 'but', she
says, 'I just had this strong feeling that it was the right one for them. I
painted it in 1986-87 after I saw a picture in the paper.
'I was deeply shocked by the image of those women in clothes which I
associate with a nun's habit, holding rocket launchers. I'd never seen the
desert but I knew it was pink; I deliberately made it the colour of women's
make-up.'
But although much of the work on display does deal with women's roles,
women's bodies, it would be misleading to herd all the donated works into a
feminist questioning of gendered identity. Hambling would not welcome the
feminist label: 'I'm an artist and I happen to be a woman.'
Why such a startlingly positive reaction to the project? As Ian Shaw, a
Fellow of the college, explains: 'The lesser known artists were being
offered a platform for their work.
'The famous names were simply doing the college a favour, but we saw a
snowball effect, as those who had refused at first heard who else was
getting involved and asked if they could be included too.'
So prestige has become a consideration - the collection's size and
specialisation make it unique in Britain. But there are other factors
significant for the working artist. The works are promised permanent
showing, in carefully chosen spots around the college: we generally like to
ask the artist to come and pick a site, says Christopher Stevenson.
And - unlike work in many major galleries, these pieces will never be
consigned to the storeroom.

It is hard to imagine that the spectacle of detumescent Scottish nationalism
can be anything like as gripping as blood-feuding Albanians who provided the
excellent opener to BBC 2's 'Under the Sun' trilogy on European tribalism.
All the same, it should be worth watching gloomy kilt-wearers analyse the
Scottish Nationalists' election route in the concluding film, Ninety-Minute
Patriots (9.30).
Feuds and hanky-panky within the bosom of another tribe continues to prove
gripping entertainment in Behind the Lines, BBC 1's acclaimed drama series
about the police (9.30).
Otherwise it is a dullish evening unless you pant for the merry laughter and
effervescent wit of the folks on Terry Wogan's Friday Night on BBC 1
(10.20.)
By an extremely strange coincidence, inhabitants of Ilfracombe in North
Devon can see their dear little town twice over. First it appears as the
location for BBC 1's cringingly idiotic Challenge Anneka (8.00) and then, on
an altogether higher plane, Ilfracombe's gardens are scrutinised in Garden
Club on C4 (9.00).

FT  02 OCT 92 / Arts: Joshua Bell - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over many years in the Festival Hall, the BBC Symphony has offered
programmes for serious music-lovers - serious enough to know that they could
listen free at home, with digital sound, instead of paying something close
to the independent orchestras' prices for good seats. In the hall, audiences
were often painfully sparse. This season, all seats for the BBCSO concerts
cost Pounds 9, all unreserved - and the experience of live music-making,
after all, is beyond price. Not enough people know that yet; but on
Wednesday it was a pleasure to find eager listeners crowding the front
two-thirds of the hall, instead of being thinly spaced by income-level gaps.
If there was a specific attraction, it was hard to pin it down. Perhaps the
young virtuoso Joshua Bell, in Prokofiev's Violin Concerto no. 1 - but
virtuoso-groupies would not have warmed to Alexander Goehr's crypto-serial
Little Symphony (1963) with the generosity of this audience. (Andrew Davis
conducted it with lucid sympathy; it sounded not only serenely cogent but
full of aural imagination, plain but telling.) Nor, surely, would sober
Goehr fans have been enticed by the closing piece, Vaughan Williams'
pictorial 'A London Symphony' from 50 years earlier, though I expect Davis
did it equal justice.
What was certain was that Bell gave a marvellous account of the Prokofiev
concerto, superbly assured and fresh, even dewy - as if it carried no
daunting virtuoso-history. It does have such a history, including a
celebrated Isaac Stern recording that every concert violinist knows. Bell
might have been deliberately refusing comparisons. Instead of mimicking
Stern's strict-time raptness at the start and the close, he was teasingly
hesitant and fanciful; the 'effects' - disembodied whistling in high
harmonics, gypsy snarls sul ponticello (rough bowing near the bridge of the
instrument) - sounded like spontaneous dramatic colour. All of it lived and
breathed.
Amid a generation of alarmingly gifted violin-players, Bell and the Siberian
Maxim Vengerov (even younger) stand out by virtue of early discovery and
precocious maturity. They make a fascinating contrast, a bit like Domingo v.
Pavarotti: the one a conscious, self-effacing artist with an imagination and
a technique equal to almost anything that musical ends could require, the
other a 'natural', purpose-born phenomenon of instinctive musicianship - but
those tenors were grown-up performers when they hit their stride, and these
violinists are barely past adolescence. Should either of them be run over by
a bus, you may spend years regretting that you didn't hear them live.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Management: The real fight in a phoney war - Robert Rice
looks at the international counterfeit trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In February 1989, Britain's Department of Health informed Glaxo that
counterfeits of its ulcer drug, Zantac, had been found in the UK.
This was a serious blow for Glaxo. Zantac was then, and still is, the
world's best selling drug with sales of more than Pounds 1.7bn worldwide
last year. The last thing the company wanted was a loss of confidence in the
drug which was driving its bottom line.
Although, officially, this was the first time that fake pharmaceuticals had
been discovered in the UK, Glaxo cannot have been surprised. Counterfeit
drugs are big business. The International Chamber of Commerce estimates that
5 per cent of the Dollars 100bn of pharmaceuticals sold across borders each
year are fake. As an expensive drug in huge demand, Zantac was an obvious
target.
But it is not just counterfeit drugs which are big business. Just about
everything from perfume to motor spares has been targeted by pirates in
recent years. In 1990, the Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau estimated that
as much as 6 per cent of world trade was counterfeit. Last year, that had
risen to 8 per cent.
The cost to legitimate business in lost sales and damage to reputation can
only be guessed at. In the music industry, 500m counterfeit cassettes,
compact discs and records flood the markets each year, costing an industry
worth Dollars 25bn worldwide an estimated Dollars 1.5bn in lost sales.
The strategies adopted by industry for tackling piracy include:
Co-ordinated, industry-wide action at domestic and international level. This
approach is common to industries where the scale of the problem limits the
impact of unilateral action by individual companies and where there are
consumer safety implications. Industry associations formulate and promote
anti-piracy policies and co-ordinate international efforts.
Containment through customs regimes. Common to most areas of industry where
counterfeit imports threaten domestic markets. Involves keeping customs
informed of legitimate importers and the use of covert devices by
manufacturers in packaging and design to identify the legitimate product.
Lobbying legislators for tighter protection of patents, trade marks and
copyright through vehicles such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. Common to most industries where there is an agreed overall approach
to protection of intellectual property rights. The music industry for
example believes uniform copyright protection of 50 years in Europe and
America would substantially reduce the problem of pirated records, tapes and
CDs.
Unilateral action by companies to search, seize and destroy counterfeit
goods. Common to industries which suffer badly from cheap, mass-produced
imitations such as the fashion, perfume, watches and shoe industries.
A number of industries use a combination of these strategies.
In the pharmaceutical sector, the preference is for co-ordinated
industry-wide action.
Drug companies are not discouraged from taking unilateral action, says Peter
Lumley of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. But
because of the potentially fatal consequences of counterfeit medicines, they
tend to be wary of saying 'there is a question mark over our product', in
case it produces a loss of confidence.
Glaxo has experimented with holograms on its packaging and odd shapes for
pills which cannot be made easily by standard machinery.
Europe has a thriving circular trade in pharmaceuticals, thanks to pricing
differentials for medicines in EC member states. France, for example, pays
30 per cent less than the UK for its products, making it highly profitable
for importers to buy in bulk in France and import back to the UK. EC
competition rules prevent manufacturers from taking action to stop them.
This circular trade makes it much harder for wholesalers to spot
counterfeits mixed in with bulk consignments of legitimate imports and
blunts attempts by manufacturers to tackle the problem through tighter
control of distribution chains.
Ford which has a growing problem with counterfeit spare motor parts flooding
into Europe adopts a policy of containment, working closely with customs and
trading standards officers. The company believes there is little point
trying to track down the source of counterfeit production.
'Chances are it will be a factory in a third world country employing 300
people which is vital to the local economy,' Ford says. 'You're unlikely to
get much co-operation from the authorities in that situation.'
Like the drug companies, Ford is working on covert changes to its packaging
of spare parts which are sold under the trademark, Motorcraft. It is,
however, reluctant to talk about the problem. The counterfeits tend to be
high-selling parts, such as brake pads and tyres. The safety implications of
poor quality fakes are obvious and the company is not keen to advertise its
predicament.
A number of industries support the idea of tighter customs controls. Customs
controls in the single market are only as strong as the weakest link in the
chain around the Community. More than 100 companies including Reebok,
Adidas, Apple, Nike, IBM, and Nintendo, support a call for tighter customs
controls in the EC.
They want EC customs to consult them when they receive shipments from
companies outside the community, not authorised to import their products.
Other companies use private investigators or their own in-house
investigation units. Lacoste spends FFr15m (Pounds 1.72m) a year on
combating piracy. Yves Saint Laurent group has set aside Pounds 3.3m a year
to tackle the problem and hired its own investigator. It believes this
approach has paid dividends.
In the first half of 1990, it carried out 600 raids in Bangkok, Malaysia and
Taipei, seizing documents establishing a connection between counterfeit
producers of YSL, Chanel and L'Oreal goods, and companies in France which it
is suing.
In a recent public display of its tough new approach, it ceremoniously
destroyed part of a counterfeit haul of its perfume, Opium, with a street
value of Pounds 11m, seized in north London. The company is a long way from
eradicating the problem, but says that if you know the source of the
counterfeits, it's an approach which makes sense.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Management: Strategy comes down from the ivory tower -
Christopher Lorenz assesses some unusually practical research into
competitive performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For well over a decade, the term 'strategic management' has been bandied
about by a growing body of consultants, academics and business people - from
chief executives down to quite junior line managers. It has become part of
the language of MBA courses and of programmes for more experienced
executives.
Yet, pressed to explain what it means, many executives offer a definition
which confuses strategic management with strategic planning. The latter was
the rage in the 1970s but is sneered at by most consultants and academics
these days as being an ivory tower headquarters activity which was too
reliant on unreliable forecasts.
Given this confusion, there has long been a need for an up-to-date,
accessible, and, preferably, non-American, publication which not only makes
the difference clear, but also provides a plain person's guide to various
other aspects of the creation and execution of business and corporate
strategy.
In particular need of down-to-earth examination have been various strategic
buzz-phrases, ideas and techniques which have become fashionable since the
1970s - most notably the blockbuster 'competitive strategy' concepts of
Michael Porter from Harvard. Business executives have also needed help with
the question of how far strategy-creation should be a logical, or intuitive,
process.
All this, and more, is covered by The Challenge of Strategic Management, the
flagship volume in Cranfield School of Management's new Management Research
Series*. One of its many swipes at conventional wisdom is that 'the
strategies an organisation pursues are not necessarily what is espoused by
the organisation or its senior figures'. Instead, they are 'the direction an
organisation is actually pursuing, perceived or otherwise'.
On the confusion between strategic management and planning, the book says
the latter term became associated with an activity carried out somewhat
remotely from line management, and reviewed at inflexibly pre-set intervals.
'It was also associated with long-term planning, which was inclined to take
a definitive view of the future, and to extrapolate trend lines'. Moreover,
'economic turbulence was insufficiently considered, and the reality - that
much strategy is formulated and implemented in the act of managing the
enterprise - was ignored'.
Strategic management, by contrast, takes planning out of the headquarters
ivory tower, and 'puts the activity back where it belongs: with the line
manager'.
The book is especially useful for its clear analysis of the many different
and often conflicting factors which create corporate and business strategies
in most organisations: not just rational planning, but all sorts of
political, cultural, organisational and environmental influences, as well as
the visionary power of leaders.
Given that some of these influences were christened by their American
progenitors with such off-putting names as 'logical incrementalism' and
'organisational ecology', the book's clarity is doubly welcome. Among other
things, it emphasises that an organisation's vision - one of the most
powerful aspects of strategy - can emanate not only from its individual
leader (or leaders), but also from well beneath the top.
According to research by Cliff Bowman which is reported in the book, many
managers, and even some academics, misapply Michael Porter's work on
'generic strategies'. This argues, among other things, that businesses have
to make a basic choice between competing on the basis either of lowest cost
(what Porter calls 'cost leadership') or of 'differentiation' - the addition
of extra features to a product or service in order to differentiate it from
the competition.
Bowman makes the important, though unoriginal, observation that, as Toyota
and other companies have demonstrated, these two strategies are not nearly
as exclusive as Porter suggests. Bowman also reports that executives confuse
the Harvard professor's definition of cost leadership with the less exacting
criterion of 'low cost'.
Andy Bailey and Gerry Johnson, two other contributors to the book, also
stress that while organisational innovation and variation (of processes,
structures and systems) may come about as a rational, intentional response
to the environment, they may also occur unintentionally. This may happen
through any of the following circumstances: conflict over control of
resources; accident; errors; tactical moves; and luck.
Bowman and Johnson emphasise the importance to an organisation of being able
to uncover hidden differences in the perceptions and attitudes of its
executives (senior and otherwise), and of debating competitive strategy in a
way that renders everyone's assumptions clear, not cloaked. The academics
describe various simple but powerful mapping techniques which display such
differences in a way that has operational meaning for managers, rather than
merely in the sort of intangible fashion suggested by some consultants.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Warhorses relive heroic
defeats - Ivo Dawnay listens to the old music of boos and jeers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR just a few minutes, the Labour conference turned into its old self
yesterday. And inevitably, it was the platform veterans - Mr Arthur
Scargill, NUM president, and Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover - who
brought the floor to its feet.
With rip-roaring 'I-told-you-so' speeches on the relentless decline of the
coal industry, the two warhorses invoked the spirit of the miners' strike
and other heroic defeats.
To top it off, there even followed a spat with the rightwing engineers,
accompanied by the magical music of boos and jeers that, in the good old,
bad old days, alerted the most somnolent reporters to the prospect of a
front-page story.
But, as has characterised this listless week in Blackpool, there was no real
story, merely a bit of blowing off steam. 'What you saw there was a
nostalgic look back at the past,' said Mr Alistair Darling, the new City
spokesman on Labour's modernist wing.
Labour's new conformism and the steely grip with which the new party
leadership has established its authority has been the true and unspectacular
story of the week.
There have been a few fleeting gestures of resistance. Yesterday delegates
arrived to find the union barons had fired a warning shot on reform of their
block vote by passing a motion, all but ruling out any serious change to the
party-union relationship.
'There is some unfinished business there,' Mr Stuart Bell, the Middlesbrough
MP and another moderniser, remarked.
Yet, elsewhere, there were some clues to the readiness of the party's newly
emollient supreme authority to roll over and play the leadership's game.
Another motion, calling for the maintenance of Clause IV - the highly
totemic commitment to public ownership - was, largely unnoticed, voted down
by 4.3m discredited block votes to 1.2m.
Similarly discreetly, Blackpool '92 also voted for the conference's own
emasculation. In consequence, a new mechanism for policymaking - dominated
by the national executive committee and shadow cabinet under Mr John Smith's
leadership - will reduce its future powers only to those of veto.
Furthermore, Mr Smith - previously viewed as uninterested in party
management - has demonstrated that the pace of a well-upholstered tortoise
might well prove more effective than the hyperactive style of a Kinnock
hare.
That, together with the plight of the government, is Labour's good news. But
the principal question mark that has dominated the past four days centres on
whether Labour has done anything this week to alter an image as outdated and
as unrepresentative of modern Britain as the redbrick seaside resort of
Blackpool itself.
Under a platform like something out of the Festival of Britain, Mr Smith's
speech promoted the stolid values of the 1950s - moral, austere, pragmatic -
but proved entirely devoid of signposts as to which way the party has to go.
Long-time conference-goers have remarked that this year it has been flatter
and duller than any they can remember. There has been no real debate of the
causes that lay behind the April election defeat, or on how they should be
addressed.
Introspective, but shallowly so, Labour appears more and more like the
Church of England - ready to change just enough to irritate some of the
older traditionalists, but not sufficiently to win any new converts.
Even new bloods like Mr Blair have felt obliged to recite the liturgy, while
Mr Brown paid lip service with an unexplained and unconvincing promise to
tackle the foreign exchange speculators.
Not one frontbench spokesman addressed head-on how the individualist, not to
say greedy, south of the country is to be persuaded to mend its ways. Or,
alternatively, how Labour will mend its own.
That, we are promised, will come next year.
It is unfortunate, nonetheless, for the 'modernisers' that Scargill and
Skinner proved the show's best double act.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Divisions resurface on
electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDE division at all levels of the party over whether it should back
electoral reform and proportional representation erupted at the Labour
conference yesterday.
A heated debate showed no clear consensus over the direction the party
should take. Supporters of PR, who fear Labour will continue to be denied
power under the present system, clashed with those who objected to a Labour
manifesto being diluted in a coalition government.
Delegates approved a second 'interim report' of the working party on
electoral reform chaired by Professor Raymond Plant. The working party hints
that it is moving towards recommending an additional member system for
parliamentary elections.
But Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader and a member of the Plant
committee, told delegates that any alternative would be weighed against the
current 'first past the post' system - which Professor Plant himself
acknowledged may yet remain under Labour's eventual proposals.
'There is no one perfect, correct, theoretically supreme voting system,' Mrs
Beckett said.
The Plant committee reports next spring. Mr Robin Cook, a member of the
shadow cabinet and the Labour campaign for electoral reform, has called for
a commitment to change at next year's conference.
Mrs Jean Lord, of the Littleborough and Saddleworth Labour party, said she
wanted 'a Labour government.' She said: 'I don't want a coalition. We hear
that PR is fairer to smaller parties. I didn't join the Labour party to be
fair to the Liberals.'
Mr John Kemp, from Dundee West, said: 'The simple fact is that the present
electoral system . . . has for almost a century all but marginalised the
Labour party.' Deals with other parties could come up under 'first past the
post' too.
Mr Jeff Rooker, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr and chair of the electoral
reform campaign, pointed to the lack of representation for more than 1m
Labour voters in 16 shire counties that did not elect a single Labour MP,
compared with the 54 Labour MPs elected by fewer voters in the 11 largest
cities.
Two motions - one backing PR and another opposing it - were withdrawn on the
recommendation of the NEC to avoid pre-empting the conclusions of the Plant
committee.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Blair outlines agenda on
crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS had to take responsibility for combating crime but that should
not be a substitute for the responsibility of individuals, Mr Tony Blair,
the shadow home secretary, told the conference yesterday.
Outlining a fresh agenda for Labour on the home affairs beat, Mr Blair - a
possible future challenger for the Labour leadership - steered between a
1960s liberal emphasis on social conditions and a 1990s concern with the
aspirations of individuals.
'There is no excuse for crime, but when young men and women seek but do not
find any reflection of their hopes in the society around them . . . when
communities disintegrate and people within them feel they have no chance to
improve, then it takes not a degree in social science, merely a modicum of
common sense to see that, in the soil of alienation, crime will take root.'
He did not believe there was a choice between self-interest and public good.
'It is only on the foundation of a strong and fair society that individual
aspiration can best be built.'
Mr Blair took only tentative steps towards backing a 'written constitution'
for the UK - calling for a 'full and proper' freedom of information act and
the incorporation into UK law of the European convention on human rights as
the 'first step to a new bill of rights for Britain'.
He called for proper scrutiny of the secret services, via a Commons
committee, and the restoration of full trade union rights at the
government's GCHQ communications centre at Cheltenham.
Later, Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy Labour leader, warned that freedoms in
Britain were being 'steadily, stealthily removed'. Secrecy, for instance,
was being imposed on nurses and doctors under health reforms, she said.

FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Leadership under siege on
defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARTY leadership received its traditionally rough ride on defence last
night, as delegates rejected a request to postpone consideration of a call
to cut UK defence spending to the average level of other west European
countries.
A similar motion was carried convincingly - against the ruling national
executive committee's advice - at last year's pre-election conference. The
result of yesterday's formal card vote will be made known this morning.
Delegates also demanded a ballot on a motion opposed by the NEC urging a
Labour government to scrap the Trident nuclear submarine programme. Last
year, a call for 'immediate abandonment' of Trident was thrown out by a 3-2
margin.
Mr Tony Clarke of the NEC said in a conciliatory speech that the leadership
had requested postponement of the defence spending motion 'not because we
are hostile to it, but because of its vagueness'.
There was 'no detail' of the timescale involved for the cuts and the
countries whose defence spending constituted the average to which the UK
should aspire were not specified. The party's policy on Trident was to 'put
it into the strategic talks'.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, pledged to help combat defence
industry unemployment by formulating plans to set up a viable defence
diversification agency.
Earlier, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, attacked the
government for its failure to 'take any new initiative' during Britain's EC
presidency.
Supporting the deployment of British troops in the former Yugoslavia, he
said their task had been made harder by 'the failure . . to implement
effectively mandatory UN sanctions'.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Ex-chairman of Imperial: Obituary of Geoffrey Kent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEOFFREY KENT, former chairman and chief executive of Imperial Group, who
led the tobacco conglomerate's unsuccessful defence against Hanson's
takeover bid in 1985-86, has died at the age of 70.
Mr Kent, who with a deceptively diffident public manner had brought a
disciplined, hands-on management style to Imperial in the four years of his
leadership, resigned from the group after the takeover.
He became chairman of Mansfield Brewery in 1989 and remained a director of
Lloyds Bank, joining its board in 1981.
Educated at Blackpool Grammar School, which he left for wartime service in
RAF Coastal Command, Mr Kent began his career in advertising. He worked for
Coleman, Prentice &amp; Varley, then one of London's leading agencies, and
Johnson &amp; Johnson before joining Imperial as marketing manager for John
Player in 1958.
Mr Kent quickly established his reputation in the competitive cigarette
market. He was responsible for the long-running slogan 'People love Players'
and created a number of popular cigarette brands. They included Player's No
6, for a time the country's best-selling cigarette, and perhaps most notably
John Player Special, with its distinctive black packet and successful motor
racing sponsorship. Mr Kent became joint managing director of John Player in
1969, and six years later chairman and managing director.
He moved to Courage, then Imperial's brewing subsidiary, in 1978 as chairman
and chief executive, and brought his marketing skills to bear on its
fortunes. His 'Cockney pub' advertising campaign helped to change the face
of beer advertising.
Three years later, after a boardroom coup, he took over leadership of
Imperial.
After the Hanson takeover, which overturned plans for a merger of Imperial
and United Biscuits, he remained unattached to any company for two years
until Mansfield invited him to become its chairman.
His marketing talents were again employed there, and he led the company out
of a series of diversified activities back to its core beer business.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Bottomley faces pressure on health funding reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is under pressure to explain the
financing of next year's community care reforms when she addresses social
services leaders today.
The biggest-ever changes in community care, based on providing services for
elderly and handicapped people in the community rather than in institutions,
is only six months away from implementation.
However, Mrs Bottomley, locked into a difficult public-spending round, has
not been able to allocate budgets to local authorities which will be
responsible for co-ordinating the new arrangements.
Mrs Bottomley has to obtain sufficient funds to ensure the smooth
implementation of the reforms and to win enough money to honour the
government's commitment to maintaining growth in health service expenditure.
Council leaders made clear yesterday that they want Mrs Bottomley to discuss
the financial arrangements for community care when she addresses the
conference of the Association of Directors of Social Services and the
local-authority associations today.
Mr Toby Harris, chair of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities social
services committee, said the government was leaving it 'perilously late' to
announce the level of resources for community care.
The association says more than Pounds 750m will be needed to cover the total
cost of operating the new community care system in England.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Many roofing sites 'are unsafe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHY MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY a quarter of all roofing sites inspected this summer were shut down
because they broke safety law, the Health and Safety Executive said
yesterday, Cathy Milton writes.
'For too long, roof work has been seen as a rogue industry attracting the
unscrupulous 'get-rich-quick' brigade,' Dr Tim Carter, the HSE's field
operations director, said.
He said the figures showed that bad safety practice was 'deep-rooted' in the
roofing industry. In a four-month national inspection drive starting in May,
2,596 roofs were checked and 29 prosecutions completed. One contractor was
fined Pounds 20,000 - the statutory maximum - for offences involving a
death.
More than 600 prohibition notices were issued, forcing contractors to stop
work until workplaces complied with safety law. The average fine was Pounds
2,500. Almost 100 more prosecutions are being considered.
More than one in five of deaths in construction occurs during roof work.
About three workers a month are killed falling off roofs and passers-by have
been hit by falling materials. In the past three years, 109 workers have
been killed and more than 2,500 seriously injured.
The HSE estimates that there are more than 7,000 roofing contractors in
Britain employing about 30,000 workers.
Next year the HSE plans to run a similar campaign which will focus on the
use of protective equipment.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Accounts TV service attracts interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 11,000 acc-ountants have already registered an interest in
subscribing to Accountancy Television, the service for accountants launched
yesterday.
The interest in the weekly programme - the latest offered by BBC Select - is
greater than expected.
BBC Select uses BBC transmitters to deliver specialist programmes in the
early hours to a special video recorder - a BBC Selector - that unscrambles
and records the hour-long programmes.
Mr Mike Lickiss, chairman of ATV, which has been set up by five of the main
accountancy bodies, said accountants were often in the spotlight in a way
that was alien to them.
'The accountancy bodies now recognise that while training has focused on
technical issues, it has not always created sufficient awareness of the
current issues of the day,' Mr Lickiss said.
Individual subscribers will pay Pounds 750 a year but international firms
could pay up to Pounds 10,000.
The programmes, produced by Workhouse Productions, the independent
television production company, will range from news and views to technical
training.
'There will be a lot of emphasis on things that are about to happen in the
next few months which will affect accountants,' said Mr Peter Williams,
editor of the programme and a former editor of Accountancy Age magazine.
The first BBC Select service, Executive Business Club, has more than 2,500
corporate subscribers and is expected to have a turnover of more than Pounds
1m in its first years.
The go-ahead has been given for a service for lawyers. The pilot programme
for the service is expected to be produced next month.
By the end of next year the BBC expects to have at least six subscription
services.

FT  02 OCT 92 / PSA arm taken over by Tarmac: Government pays buyer Pounds
50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, Britain's biggest construction and building materials group,
yesterday took over the Property Services Agency's projects division. The
move puts under threat the jobs of 900 former government employees.
The government has paid the company almost Pounds 50m to take over
responsibility for the division, one of the country's biggest construction
organisations, employing 1,800 people.
Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said: 'It was the best deal we could
have got. It would have cost the taxpayer a lot more if we had been forced
to shut down the division rather than disposing of it to Tarmac.'
For many years the projects division has designed and managed the
construction of buildings for government and other public-sector bodies.
Tarmac said it could guarantee work for only 925 people.
The Environment Department said it was too early to say how many people
would be left without work. Some might be employed on a temporary basis with
Tarmac. Others might be transferred elsewhere in the public sector or opt
for voluntary redundancy.
Mr Redwood said the cash payment to Tarmac recognised that money needed to
be invested in the business if it was to continue. In addition to the Pounds
49.75m payment, the government had offered to provide financial assistance
to help with redundancy payments if they rose above a certain level.
He said Tarmac's offer was chosen from a final shortlist of six. About 60
companies, including some international groups, originally expressed
interest in acquiring the division. attracted by the prospect of taking
advantage of its public-sector contacts. The division, which last year had a
turnover of Pounds 190m has wide experience of building offices, courts,
prisons, laboratories, civil and military airports. Its experience of
public-sector building requirements and strong links with government
departments has meant that it has continued to win a large share of work
even though most public-sector construction contracts are now subject to
competitive tender.
Control of the Property Services Agency is being switched to the private
sector in two stages, and the PSA's building management operations will be
offered for sale later this year.
NEW DESIGN orders for construction work have fallen and there is little
chance of improvement next year, the Royal Institute of British Architects
said in its quarterly report yesterday.
The value of new commissions fell 14 per cent to Pounds 1.12bn in the second
quarter of this year. Wales and Scotland were worst affected, with 36 per
cent falls in orders. The south-west was the only area to record a rise in
new commissions, up 14 per cent.
The institute said: 'The optimism generated by the election has disappeared.
Despondency is the order of the day throughout the industry. Our view is
that 1993 will be another year of depressed workloads for the profession.'
Just 18 per cent of practices expect a rise in work over the next six
months, compared with 28 per cent last quarter.
A further 126 staff are to be made redundant at the Construction Industry
Training Board, which blamed reduced income due to the recession.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Chancellor delays to fight another day: The public-spending
round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision to delay the until Monday yesterday's planned meeting of the
public expenditure committee chaired by Mr Norman Lamont at least means that
the embattled chancellor is not having to fight on every front at once.
The hard decisions cannot be postponed for long and the signs are that
public-sector pay and capital projects will be sacrificed in order to keep
to the Pounds 244.5bn planning total.
The desperation as Whitehall and Downing Street try to find a way through
next year's expenditure is illustrated by the serious scrutiny of the
manifesto pledge on child benefit to see if taxing the benefit could be made
compatible with the words, whatever the spirit of the commitment.
Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, is said to have knocked a
'significant sum' off the threatened Pounds 14bn overbids for next year, but
the task this year is made more, not less, difficult by the mix of the old
and new systems.
In future years, cyclically affected spending such as unemployment benefit
will be stripped out of the 'control total' so that it does not affect
departmental programme spending in the years when it rises most quickly. For
1993-94 it is included within the planning total, however.
That allows for social security payments to rise to Pounds 76bn next year,
on the basis of a jobless total of 2.4m. The reality is likely to be 3m or
more, leading automatically to an increase in spending of at least Pounds
2bn. Against that background, public-sector pay has become an obvious
target. At a meeting with Tory backbenchers a week ago, MPs singled out pay
as a prime area for cuts.
The climate may well make the government feel it has a winnable
presentational fight on its hands if it aims for an increase of no more than
2 per cent in public-sector pay.
Relative job security in the public sector has an obvious value as
unemployment continues to rise, while the findings of the New Earnings
Survey, published last week, that public-sector pay has outstripped
private-sector pay for the first time since 1986, will also provide
ammunition.
Much of the public-sector pay bill, running at more than Pounds 70bn and
rising by about 10 per cent a year recently, is within ministers' control
it. The government can determine pay for the Civil Service and for the armed
forces, as well as for teachers and those health service workers who are
covered by pay review bodies whose recommendations ministers can decide to
stage.
The main difficulty is 2.3m local authority staff, for whom the government
can influence a settlement through the amount of grant it distributes, but
cannot control. Councils are old adversaries for the government, but the
year when the council tax is introduced is not necessarily the one ministers
would have chosen for a propaganda battle on local spending. Nonetheless,
the attractions of reducing the pay bill to help salvage some capital
projects are evident. Both ministers and backbenchers have come under
pressure from lobbies and constituents fearful that delays or cancellations
will damage the construction industry still further.
Inevitably, however, capital spending is not escaping unscathed. With the
recession reducing traffic congestion, the Pounds 2.5bn planned for road
building next year looks vulnerable, and it is hard to see the Pounds 2bn a
year for the Housing Corporation surviving intact, particularly as housing
has not managed to achieve the political status of health or education.
Equally, however persuasive the Ministry of Defence is about the immediate
costs of cancelling projects such as the European fighter Aircraft, the
Pounds 24.5bn MoD budget is regarded with greedy eyes.
Nor will the Pounds 26bn-plus for the three territorial departments
(Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) be immune in the way it would once
have been under the formula ensuring that they automatically received due
proportions of spending in England.
There is little sign of a de minimis rule: in terms of billions, the Pounds
75m for a new prison service headquarters in Derby seems little enough, but
the project has already been cancelled just a couple of weeks after the
first brick was laid and the construction contract signed.
One Treasury official compared the new, strict public-spending regime which
the government was imposing on itself with the external economic discipline
that had been embraced in joining the European exchange rate mechanism. The
analogy is not a comfortable one for any of those involved.

A RADICAL improvement in the career structure of academic researchers is
advocated by the Royal Society, the UK's senior scientific body, in a report

It says far too many scientists exist on an uncertain succession of

The Royal Society says no researcher should have to undertake more than two
short-term contracts. After that, they should compete for longer-term
fellowships guaranteeing salary and research expenses for at least five
years.
'Central to the objective of these fellowships is that they are allocated to
individuals, primarily on the basis of individual talent,' the report says.
Unlike short-term contracts, fellowships could be carried to any academic
institution.
The proposal would require co-operative action by the five research councils
and the Universities Funding Council to create at least 500 fellowships.

'The greatest need of many firms is for high quality and timely business

'When managers, especially of smaller firms, want information or advice,
they usually need it immediately. They need to know where to go, or whom to
phone, and to be confident they will hit the right target first time.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Cash-strapped councils run for cover: The expected strains
from a steep rise in premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXETER City Council's insurance policies with the troubled Municipal Mutual
expired on Wednesday night. Yesterday, having failed to obtain cover
elsewhere, it closed its leisure facilities and took all its vehicles off
the road.
Aerobics classes and guided tours were suddenly halted as the council met in
emergency session to resolve the crisis. Mr Chester Long, council leader,
said the authority had two firms of brokers working all day and could secure
only one 'highly unsatisfactory' offer which, for some aspects of business,
was four times the MMI premium.
Exeter's troubles are an extreme example of the difficulties many councils
face as a result of the demise of Municipal Mutual, which stopped writing
new business and temporarily stopped paying claims on Wednesday.
Municipal Mutual insured the great majority of local risks. Councils face
steep increases in premiums, as well as sizeable reductions in the amount of
insurance cover they are likely to obtain after their policies expire.
Hard hit by two years of record losses and with their own capital bases
depleted, other insurance companies are not enthusiastic about selling
policies to local authorities, although their business is worth over Pounds
600m a year. Some cover is available at the Lloyd's market, but
underwriters, stung by losses, are taking a cautious approach.
Insurance brokers have been able to find alternatives but are negotiating
cover on a case-by-case basis.
One broker said yesterday: 'It is extraordinary to see the ninth-largest
insurer going insolvent and the insurance industry unable to do anything
about it.'
Insurers are worried about claims arising from awards to victims of the
'pin-down' disciplinary regime, the epidemic of arson attacks on schools,
and the cost of cleaning up contaminated land, which they fear might fall on
public liability policies.
Contraction in the insurance market means coverage on the basis offered by
MMI will be much more expensive. Jardine International yesterday offered a
one-month policy covering employers' liability, public and product liability
and most other risks, quoting prices well above the rates councils had been
used to.
Eastleigh District Council yesterday bought a Jardine policy, allowing it to
operate its bus services.
Mr Arthur Boulter, local-government director of the Chartered Institute of
Public Finance and Accountancy, said premium increases of 30 per cent to 40
per cent appear to be 'par for the course'.
Mr Boulter said: 'There is no obligation on local authorities to insure
themselves, but it would be imprudent for them not to do so. They should
also exercise extreme care to ensure that the use of cars for private use,
and the like, is properly covered.'
With spending of most councils capped by the government, and next year's
spending limits certain to be tight, the implications for council budgets
are serious. Mr Bob Block, chief executive of Oxford City Council, said he
expected to have to find an extra Pounds 100,000 for insurance cover on a
capped budget of Pounds 18m.
Spending limits from the Department of the Environment for councils make no
specific allowance for insurance. The department said it was 'very unlikely'
that the standard spending assessment targets for councils would be altered
next year to account for higher insurance costs.
The difficulties may also mean a tougher time for local-authority managers.
Mr Peter Friend, of brokers Leslie &amp; Godwin, which arranged insurance
coverage for about 40 councils over the past year, suggests managements will
come under more pressure to contain claims.
He says insurers are likely to offer less cover, insisting on much bigger
excesses. Brokers will also offer consultancy services to councils advising
them on how they can reduce the number of smaller claims.
Local-authority associations are anxious to play down crisis talk. The
associations, which yesterday met Municipal Mutual, still hope the company
will be able to meet claims on outstanding policies.
Mr Brian Briscoe, chief executive of Hertfordshire county council - almost
all of whose insurance is covered by MMI - said MMI's troubles were of
'extreme concern, but not a matter for panic'.
In the 'worst case', Hertfordshire may face a bill of up to Pounds 5m in
uncovered claims and increased premiums. But, provided MMI met past and
current claims, the cost would probably be in 'hundreds of thousands'.
A number of authorities had already begun to shift their insurance cover
away from MMI before the collapse. Newcastle and Leeds city councils for
example, have moved a significant proportion of cover to other companies and
both are paying lower premiums than those offered by MMI.
Mr James Gravenor, Newcastle-upon-Tyne's assistant treasurer, said the city
was prepared to pay 'significant excesses' in moving its remaining MMI
cover, and predicted 'a marked trend towards more self-insurance'.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Customs reports 12% rise in revenue to Pounds 62bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REVENUE from taxes and duties collected by the Customs &amp; Excise department
increased by 12 per cent to Pounds 62bn, in spite of the effects of the
recession, the organisation's annual report showed yesterday.
Accounts for the year to March 31 show that Pounds 36bn - or more than 57
per cent of total revenues - came from value added tax, with a further
Pounds 11bn from hydrocarbon oils.
Only two areas of revenue declined. Car tax fell 15 per cent to Pounds
1.2bn, and duties on matches and mechanical lighters fell 13 per cent to
Pounds 15m.
Costs of collection rose 12 per cent to Pounds 643m, leaving costs as a
proportion of revenues unchanged on last year at 1.03 per cent.
The figures exclude costs of anti-smuggling work, which rose 9 per cent to
Pounds 154m, while drug seizures by value rose 49 per cent to Pounds 896m.
The 1991-92 annual report shows for the first time the performance of
Customs against targets set down in its published management plan.
VAT arrears increased to 4.4 per cent with 12 months' liability during the
period, against a target reduction to 3.8 per cent.
The aim of providing basic training within four weeks of recruitment to
1,100 executive officers was also not met, with only 80 per cent trained in
that period.
Most other stated objectives were achieved. They included a 15 per cent
improvement of productivity on Customs import work against a target of 8 per
cent, and a higher rate of examination of exports under the European
Community's common agricultural policy.
Customs achieved a 4.3 per cent improvement in value for money from new
purchasing initiatives and a 2.5 per cent reduction in unit running costs of
accommodation.
Also for the first time, the report provides the running costs and limited
information on each of the 30 executive units created in April last year
which gained greater management freedom in exchange for more accountability.
Among the collection units, running costs were greatest at London's airports
 -with a total of Pounds 43m - and at Dover, where they were Pounds 30m. The
bulk of costs among the 10 operational and support units were consumed by
investigations division, at Pounds 30m, and information technology
divisions, at Pounds 20m.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Lawson reveals Bank post offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Lawson, the former chancellor who resigned from the cabinet over
Baroness Thatcher's refusal to put sterling into the European exchange rate
mechanism, has joined the controversy over Britain's place in Europe.
In a preview of his memoirs in today's Daily Telegraph, he reveals that when
Lady Thatcher was prime minister, she tried to persuade him to stay in the
cabinet with an offer of the governorship of the Bank of England.
As Mr Nigel Lawson he walked out of the cabinet in October 1989 after a
four-year battle with the prime minister over monetary policy.
Lord Lawson reveals that during the first cabinet-level discussion of ERM
entry in 1985, Lady Thatcher threatened to quit if her cabinet forced her to
tie sterling to the D-Mark.
He says the possibility of his succeeding Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton at the
Bank was tacitly agreed by Lady Thatcher in 1987. She then reminded him of
the possibility in a vain attempt to prevent his departure.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Regulation of MMI defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry last night rejected criticism of its
regulatory role in respect of Municipal Mutual, the stricken insurance
company.
The DTI said that, based on the information available, it had acted
appropriately as soon as difficulties became apparent at the company.
It began holding talks over the future of MMI in March, after the company
approached it to discuss a possible recapitalisation. It said it had been
involved in the appointment of Mr Brian Wright as group chief executive and
had continued to monitor the company closely since then. The company and the
DTI had reached a provisional agreement on its future in July, and accounts
were produced including a heavily qualified audit report.
The DTI uses the guidelines in the 1982 Insurance Act, which specifies that
insurance companies must maintain a certain margin of solvency - or ratio of
assets to liabilities.
Below the set level, a company must supply an action plan indicating
measures it will take to convince the DTI of its ability to continue
trading. There are no specific guidelines on what that margin should be. It
depends on the level of premiums, income, claims and type of insurance
business being written.
EC regulations suggest a minimum acceptable solvency margin of 16 per cent.
The DTI says that generally it might be content with a company that has a
margin at twice that level, but it takes a number of other factors into
account when considering the health of a company, including profitability,
liquidity and strength of reserving for future claims.
If it decides to act, the secretary of state can ask the court to place the
company in liquidation. Directors also have that power.
The local authorities have called for a scheme of arrangement under company
legislation - a court-supervised procedure requiring approval by 75 per cent
of the creditors.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Howard favours 'green' taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXES AND permits head a list of 441 new measures to improve the environment
in the government's second annual progress report on its 'green' policies.
The report, published on the second anniversary of the white paper This
Common Inheritance, lists the progress - or lack of it - on more than 440
environmental commitments.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, attacked the document as
'appallingly self-congratulatory' and joined environmental groups in
criticising its failure to integrate transport and energy policies with
green issues.
Presenting the report Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said: 'I
have a general preference for economic instruments where they work more
effectively than regulation'.
Among possible new tools, the government is considering higher fuel prices,
road pricing, tradable permits for industrial emissions and a carbon tax.
Mr Howard acknowledged that no date had been set for the start of any of
those. Road pricing proposals would have to wait for a Department of
Transport study, to be published in a year at the earliest. The report -
which follows statements from Mr Howard on the importance of stricter
enforcement of EC regulation - spells out several important delays and
failures in government policies. They include:
A year's likely delay in publishing the review of renewable energy strategy,
due in spring 1992.
More than a year's likely delay in publishing a strategy for nuclear
research, due in late 1991.
Failure of most local authorities to publish recycling plans by August 1992.
Failure to introduce regulation on genetically modified organisms, due May
in 1992.
The 441 new proposals include:
New air quality standards to reduce ground-level ozone, benzene and carbon
monoxide to be set by 1993, and for sulphur dioxide and butadience by 1994.
New water quality standards to be introduced next year.
New standards for waste sites from 1993.

VAUXHALL is extending its campaign to reduce car list prices with cuts of up
to Pounds 1,188 on its Cavalier, Calibra and Senator ranges, Kevin Done
writes.
At the same time, it is reducing its dealer margins from 17.5 per cent to 10
per cent - so customers are unlikely to see any cut in prices.
The move reduces the scope for discounting by dealers. Vauxhall claimed that
the parallel reductions in list prices and dealer margins had reduced 'the
haggle factor disliked by customers'.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Blow for housebuilding body in competition case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL House Building Council yesterday lost its legal battle against
the findings of a 1991 Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into new
housing warranty services.
A High Court judge rejected the council's application for judicial review of
the MMC's conclusion that its 10-year structural warranty scheme was
anti-competitive and against the public interest.
The council had argued that the conclusion was 'irrational' and could
fatally undermine the economics of the council and the protection it gives
to house buyers.
The case focused on a council rule requiring builders to present for
inspection every home under construction and to obtain a structural warranty
policy from the council.
Mr Peter Lilley, then trade and industry secretary, had accepted the MMC's
finding that the rule could restrict competition by deterring builders from
using alternative warranty schemes available from other insurers.
The council's main insurance competitor is Foundation 15 - a subsidiary of
the leading local government insurer Municipal Mutual Insurance, which last
night imposed an indefinite freeze on claims payments.
Mr Basil Bean, council chief executive, said after the hearing that the
organisation was considering an appeal. 'The MMC's recommendations threaten
the interests of new home buyers,' he added.
The MMC said last night it was delighted with the decision. In the past five
years there have been 10 judicial review challenges to MMC decisions
including the NHBC case. In five cases the MMC's decisions were upheld; two
are under appeal and two relating to the supply of razor blades are still
pending.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Maxwell plans bankruptcy book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN MAXWELL, who last month became Britain's biggest ever bankrupt, is
planning to write a book on the difficulties of those facing personal
bankruptcy.
Mr Maxwell plans to co-author the book with a journalist. He said he had had
expressions of interest from a number of publishers.
The book would aim to help people survive the trauma of bankruptcy, and
there would be only one chapter on his own experiences - what it has been
like to be Britain's biggest bankrupt with debts of more than Pounds 400m.
The book is partly a response to hundreds of letters that Mr Maxwell - who
also faces criminal charges of theft and conspiracy to defraud - has
received from bankrupts. Many were letters from people who said they were on
the verge of suicide because of their experiences.
A proportion of any money earned by the book will go to the creditors of the
Maxwell empire - including the denuded Maxwell pension funds.
Mr Maxwell has also decided to stop claiming unemployment pay from next week
and try to set up work as a consultant.
He recently attracted considerable publicity when he tried to sign on for
unemployment - and went to the wrong place.
One piece of consultancy work has already come his way and he will in future
seek work in areas of the media and publishing and in restructuring
companies - but he will not be involved in anything to do with financial
ser-vices.
Mr Maxwell believes consultancy is likely to be the only kind of employment
he will be able to find until the charges against him come to court, which
may not happen until 1995.
He has abandoned as unrealistic attempts during the summer to raise Dollars
10m (Pounds 5.9m) to launch an international media venture partnership.
Mr Maxwell is expected to appear in the High Court today seeking a judicial
review on the duties and responsibilities of the Serious Fraud Office, which
has been investigating the affairs of the collapsed Maxwell empire.

FT  02 OCT 92 / VSEL job cuts add to Cumbria gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 390 redundancies were announced yesterday by VSEL, the nuclear
submarine shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The cuts will reduce the
workforce to under 8,000 from 14,500 two years ago.
The company said yesterday that it might eventually have to slim down the
workforce to about 5,000 because of defence cuts following the end of the
Cold War and the difficulties of breaking into depressed civilian markets -
such as offshore components - in the continuing recession. It had previously
hoped to bottom out with about 2,000 more jobs.
The latest job losses will add urgency to the visit to Barrow today of Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who will launch the Pounds
1m Cumbria Marketing Initiative, aimed at improving the promotion of Cumbria
to potential inward investors.
The initiative is supported by British Nuclear Fuels, Cumbria County Council
and the Department of Trade and Industry. The chairman will be Mr John
Hancock, chief executive of Sealy, Silentnight's bed-manufacturing
subsidiary, in Aspatria.
BNF is shedding about 1,000 local jobs over the next six months, now that
construction of its thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield is over.
But while BNF and VSEL are creating structural unemployment, Cumbria is also
counting the cost of recession - more than 1,850 other jobs have either gone
since 1990 or are scheduled to by next March.
Seven companies are involved, in the textiles, footwear, bus manufacture and
computer-aided design and manufacturing sectors.
The effect will be to wipe out most of the 4,000 jobs brought in by
intensive economic development initiatives since the last big wave of
structural unemployment caused by steel and coal closures in the Workington
and Whitehaven areas during the 1980s.
The latest cuts by VSEL will take effect in January. Numbers needed for the
development stage of Britain's Trident submarine programme peaked at about
14,500 just as construction of HMS Vanguard, the first of four boats, began.
The next two submarines - Victorious and Vigilant - are in production at
18-month intervals behind Vanguard, while parts of the unnamed fourth boat
are in the pre-assembly stage. The programme will guarantee about 5,000 jobs
to the end of 1994.
By then, unemployment is predicted to rise to 15.4 per cent in the Barrow
area, to 16.5 per cent around Whitehaven and to 17.7 per cent around
Workington.
Industrial and county leaders will today press Mr Heseltine for development
area status so the area can compete with Scotland and Wales in offering
financial aid to potential inward investors.
Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
yesterday called for another interest rate cut and urged a 'coherent'
approach to economic policy.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Tories prepare for internal
warfare - Europe likely to dominate party conference in Brighton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Conservative party could be engaged in open warfare over its
approach to Europe almost as soon as its annual party conference opens in
Brighton next Tuesday.
A series of meetings on the fringe of the conference offer the prospect of
public divisions between senior ministers and party rebels. Almost every
shade of attitude towards Europe will be voiced in occasions ranging from a
discussion of 'the sufferings of a dependent economy in the exchange rate
mechanism' to a meeting of the European People's party.
The greatest sensitivity is likely to attach to Wednesday's meetings. Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will address a lunchtime fringe meeting
on 'current challenges' in British foreign policy, and later the same day Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, delivers the Conservative Political Centre
lecture, entitled 'Europe - a community not a superstate'.
Ministers are anxious to avoid the jarring that occurred last weekend, when
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, was interviewed about the
government's approach to Europe at almost the same time as Mr John Gummer,
the agriculture minister, was describing the policy in a somewhat different
tone.
Party managers are also nervous about the prospect of Lady Thatcher's
presence, knowing that she could give a unique boost to the Eurosceptics.
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, met the former prime minister yesterday
to agree the arrangements.
On the other side of the argument, Sir Leon Brittan, an EC commissioner and
former cabinet minister, will speak at two meetings on Thursday about the
Community after the Maastricht treaty. The leading Eurosceptic MPs and peers
have already organised a relentless series of meetings. Lord Tebbit, a
former cabinet minister, is to address the Selsdon group on Tuesday, Lord
Ridley, another former cabinet minister, is to speak to a group called
Conservative Youth against European Federalism on Thursday, and Mr Michael
Spicer, a leading Eurosceptic MP is at fringe meetings almost every day.
Eurosceptics may also have high hopes of the address on 'Toryism
post-Thatcher' to be given to the Young Conservatives by Mr Kenneth Baker,
former home secretary who has become a heavyweight critic of policy on
Europe.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Hurd holds the line against
isolationists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, yesterday set out the thinking
behind Mr John Major's decision to press ahead with ratification of
Maastricht by warning that failure meet the commitment would deprive Britain
of vital political and economic influence.
In a speech approved in advance by the British prime minister as a formal
statement of government policy, Mr Hurd warned his party's Eurosceptics that
the government would not bow to isolationist calls.
He signalled that although the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty might
not return to the House of Commons until next year, ratification would not
have to wait for the outcome of a second referendum in Denmark: 'We want to
help the Danes, not hide behind them.'
Speaking to the European Policy Forum in London last night, Mr Hurd sought
to allay fears that Maastricht would provide the blueprint for a European
super-state. He confirmed that a commitment to give substance to the clause
in the treaty on the principle of subsidiarity would be a priority at this
month's EC summit in Birmingham.
The Twelve needed to show their citizens that in practice 'the Community, so
far from smothering national identity, builds on the work of nation states,
that national parliaments are crucial to the democratic control of the
Community, that none of us wants a bureaucratic centralised homogenised
Europe'.
He played down concern about a two-speed Europe, commenting: 'In fact we
already have a multi-speed Europe and no harm done.'
However, Mr Hurd insisted that the government had to stick to a principle
which had run through the heart of British foreign policy through the
centuries: 'It is against our fundamental interests so to isolate ourselves
from the continent of Europe that policies are organised there which
crucially influence our security or our prosperity but in which we have no
say.' In a sideswipe at the Eurosceptics he added: 'If that happens, we keep
our sovereignty as a slogan, and lose its substance.'
The foreign secretary signalled that the government would not scrap its
commitment to eventual re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism.
Despite indications that Mr Major believes that it will be more than a year
 -and perhaps as long as two - before sterling can again be linked to the
D-Mark, Mr Hurd suggested that abandonment of the ERM would threaten in the
medium term to 'drain the strength away from our own financial sector'.
He marked the start of a campaign by the government to rebut what it sees as
the scare tactics of opponents of the treaty by insisting that Maastricht
was 'by no means as revolutionary' as the Rome Treaty or the Single European
Act.
The intergovernmental basis of the latest treaty meant that 'under
Maastricht co-operation will develop, but with national governments firmly
in the driving seat'. He dismissed the notion that the concept of 'union
citizenship in the treaty threatened national indentities'.
He concluded that 'as applied to Britain its (the treaty's) substance is
neither miraculously splendid nor destructive of national identity'. But
without the agreement it would be much harder for Britain to ensure that its
agenda for Europe - full implementation of the single market, freer trade
with the rest of the world and enlargement - remained the EC's priorities.
'We are winning the arguments. Now is not the time to knock over the table.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S industrial and farming sectors are suffering the double bind of
high interest rates and a poor exchange rate for exporters.
About 31 per cent of Ireland's exports go to the UK, and around 42 per cent
of its imports are sourced there. So while the Irish government is battling
to maintain the punt inside the ERM, the currency's value against sterling
is undermining the country's exports.
Sterling's devaluation against the punt is also hitting manufacturers in the
domestic market as British exporters seek new opportunities in Ireland.
Yesterday sterling fell to an unprecedented 1.055 to the punt. Most analysts
consider that a 1.05 sterling/punt exchange rate is the maximum the economy
can withstand without serious disruption, although most also believe the
government will try to tough it out even if sterling drops as far 1.10.
Since sterling abandoned the ERM, Dublin has said it is determined to defend
the punt and keep it within the ERM.
Base rates rose last Monday by 3 percentage points, putting increased
pressure on profit margins of farmers and manufacturers, and upon household
budgets as mortgage rates also went up. The government says it believes
these measures will be temporary.
According to Mr Colum MacDonnell, chief executive of the Irish Exporters'
Association, 'it is a pretty disastrous situation for those who sell most of
their produce to the UK and who source their raw materials in Ireland'.
The worst-hit industries are mostly indigenous Irish companies, concentrated
in the food, textiles and consumer products sectors.
'For them the UK is a price sensitive market, where margins have been eroded
by very competent and competitive buyers. Although Irish market share has
increased over the past 4-5 years, margins are now very slim.'
The food industry works on profit margins of between 3 and 8 per cent, he
said, 'so the 12.5 per cent price change we have seen in the past 10 days,
and then the interest rate increase of 3 percentage points, is creating a
hopeless situation for many companies'.
More than a third of his association's members 'are now facing serious
problems'.
Large retailers in Ireland are cutting prices. Mr Feargal Quinn, chief
executive of Superquinn supermarkets, one of the four biggest retail chains,
with an annual turnover of some IPounds 200m, said: 'We have made
substantial price cuts of around 5 per cent on a wide range of products we
are buying from the UK.'
In the agriculture sector, sheep, pork and mushroom producers face financial
ruin.
Mr John Elmore, a spokesmen for Ireland's 52,000 sheep farmers said: 'Even
before the devaluation it was already difficult to compete.
'Prices at 78p per pound have been at their lowest ever since before joining
the common market, and now we have seen a further 10p per pound fall, and
sterling is still going down.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Smaller states defend Brussels
against big guys - Commission survives attempt to restrict its freedom of
action

THE European Commission appears to have survived a power-grab by the EC's
big member states seeking to dilute its sole right to initiate
Euro-legislation.
The Commission has become the scapegoat for popular hostility to the
Maastricht treaty, encouraging expectation that its powers would be badly
blunted, mainly by application of the principle of subsidiarity.
Community leaders hope that subsidiarity - ensuring that the EC acts only
where measures taken nationally or locally will be ineffectual - will
recapture popular support for European integration.
This week, ambassadors of the Twelve agreed new measures to apply the
principle of subsidiarity. But Germany, Britain and France, which had pushed
for a formula whereby the Commission would have to submit its proposals to
member states for scrutiny at the draft stage, were rebuffed.
Their efforts were vigorously opposed by the nine other member states, with
the smaller countries in particular concerned that their more powerful
partners would get a lockhold on the Commission - and tilt legislation in
their favour.
'The smaller countries rely on us to defend their interests,' said one
senior Commission official. 'Without a Commission which performs, their
stake in Europe is devalued.'
What has been agreed 'forces the Commission to think twice before coming up
with something,' said a Dutch diplomat, 'but member states will not be able
to force their opinions on the Commission.'
Under existing EC law, the Commission proposes, the Council of Ministers (of
the Twelve) decides, subject to some amendment from the European parliament.
But responsibility for EC legislation is obscure because Commission measures
are often taken at the request of member states.
Under the compromise unanimously agreed this week, a single state can raise
objections to Brussels proposals by invoking subsidiarity. But in most cases
it would require a simple majority to block them.
Foreign ministers will decide in Luxembourg on Monday whether to endorse
this compromise, and subsidiarity will be at the top of the agenda at the
Birmingham summit of EC leaders on October 16.
The Commission itself is already screening all proposed legislation in the
light of subsidiarity. But senior officials including Mr Jacques Delors, the
president, have been shaken by the virulence of recent attacks on 'Brussels'
 -particularly those by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, hitherto viewed as a
reliable ally.
This week's compromise, however, is merely 'a working procedure', according
to a senior official of the current UK presidency of the EC. Defining the
scope of subsidiarity, and fleshing it out with more open decision-making
and democratic accountability, is a battle still to come.
EC members hope that a full exposition of the principle of subsidiarity will
help to convince Danish voters to reconsider their opposition to the
Maastricht treaty.
Under one scenario circulating among senior diplomats in Brussels, a solemn
and binding declaration could be prepared by the Twelve, promising to
preserve national identities and to restrain centralising tendencies in
Brussels.
This companion text to the Maastricht treaty could then be put to Danish
voters in a second referendum next year, without the need to submit it to
ratification in other states.
The force of popular opposition to Brussels has encouraged national leaders
to examine other ways to open up decision-making in the Council of
Ministers. Professional civil servants accustomed to working
behind-closed-doors are reluctantly preparing studies - though many are
appalled at the prospect of proposals such as televised hearings of Council
proceedings currently being reviewed in European capitals.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Bank of France spent FFr80bn
supporting franc through crisis

<TEXT>
CONFIRMATION that the French central bank spent around FFr80bn (Pounds
9.4bn) in defending the franc during the currency crisis emerged yesterday
in the Bank of France's weekly report.
The report reveals that the bank's net external position fell by nearly
FFr83.4bn in the seven days to September 24, last Thursday. Around 95 per
cent of this will have been spent in intervening to support the currency,
said economic analysts.
The figure also includes other transactions on the official account, not all
of which are split out in the weekly report, so it is not possible to come
to an exact figure for intervention. However, it does indicate that the Bank
of France has very little left from its currency reserves, which stood at
FFr97.7bn at the end of August. The Bank of France had no comment yesterday.
The report also reveals that the bank's holdings of short-term paper rose by
FFr70.5bn over the period, representing the amount it has lent to French
commercial banks, seeking a cheaper source of funds than the overnight money
markets.
Rates for call money have climbed steeply since the French central bank
started to intervene, to more than 25 per cent earlier this week. However,
they began to ease yesterday towards 15 per cent as the central bank
injected more liquidity into the markets.
The figure emerges a day after the French government tabled a cautious
budget in an attempt to hold off a new attack against the franc.
It suggests that the central bank might find it harder to intervene to
support the currency if the markets launched another attack on the scale of
last week's currency crisis. Since last week's intervention the franc has
held above its floor against the D-Mark.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Conservative MPs turn fury on
Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY Euro-sceptics reacted with fury to the publication of the Bundesbank
note about who was to blame for sterling's difficulties on 'Black
Wednesday', queueing up to make their views known.
Perhaps more surprisingly - but also more significantly - their response
offered immediate support for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Earlier in
the week some of the same MPs had condemned him for his perceived apology to
the Germans over press coverage of Bundesbank behaviour as the pound was
suspended from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Indeed, it was the sort of rhetoric adopted by the Euro-sceptics after Black
Wednesday and Mr Lamont's apparent apology that may have contributed to the
Bundesbank's decision to make available as it did the information about its
own actions as sterling fell out of the ERM.
Even after a senior minister had urged an end to the slanging match with
Germany, leading Euro-sceptics continued to speak out.
Mr Kenneth Baker, a former cabinet minister, described the release of the
paper as a 'disgraceful episode', and insisted that Mr Lamont should not
resign.
'If Norman Lamont were to go as a result of that, in effect the chairman of
the Bundesbank would virtually be appointing the British Chancellor of the
Exchequer. I don't think that is accept-able,' Mr Baker said on BBC radio.
Sir Teddy Taylor MP, secretary of the dissident Tory Euro Reform Group,
called the row an 'undeniable insult' to Britain.
'Within days of the chancellor apologising to them for their distress at the
criticisms of the Bundesbank, they are rubbing our noses in it,' he said.
Another Tory MP, Mr Stephen Milligan, accused the Bundesbank of pointlessly
trying to stir up the row, albeit in more measured tones than some of his
colleagues.
'The problem, it seems to me, is that both sides are looking for a villain
to explain what happened to sterling on Black Wednesday.
'It wasn't the Germans, it wasn't the British Government, it was a
combination of events, notably the imminence of a French referendum,' Mr
Milligan said.
The leadership of the opposition Labour party, meeting in Blackpool for
their annual conference, entered the row on the Bundesbank's side, claiming
it as evidence that the government had been 'economical with the truth'.
Labour Euro-sceptics seemed less enthusiastic than their Tory counterparts
to enter the row on either side.

two-speed EC

MR ANIBAL Cavaco Silva, Portugal's prime minister, has called on fellow EC
leaders to give an urgent boost to ratification of the Maastricht treaty in
its agreed form by all 12 member states at the Birmingham special summit.
In an interview with the Financial Times, he warned against discussion of a
'two-speed' Europe, under which some member states would forge ahead with
economic and monetary union (Emu) more rapidly than others, and said that
further debate on the structure and management of the ERM at Birmingham
would run the risk of further destabilising EC currency markets.
'It is necessary to give another impulse to European construction (at
Birmingham) to overcome the idea that the project has fallen apart,' he
said.
'If we don't complete the ratification process, other issues will be
poisoned.' The Portuguese leader said the summit should focus on making a
new effort to explain the European integration process to a sceptical
public, and stressed the need for all 12 member states to act jointly.
Asked about recent suggestions that different EC countries might move at
different speeds towards Emu, he said: 'I think it would be very negative,
and in several countries I think it would create a very negative reaction,
not just in the south but in the north. If two speeds means a small group
with a strong head - that is, Germany - I think that even in those countries
whose currencies are linked to the D-Mark it would cause negative reactions
from public opinion. I think that's not to the advantage of the Germans.'
Mr Cavaco Silva forecast that the pound and the lira would return to the
ERM, and said that recent instability enhanced the case for more intense
monetary co-operation rather than diminishing it.
'When we examine very carefully the EMS, it seems there aren't too many deep
changes to be made,' he said in a gentle rebuff to Mr John Major's demand
for reforms.
'Perhaps some adjustments (are needed) to the way the system is managed, but
if anything is required it is more co-operation among the monetary
institutions, not less. This points clearly to progressing as soon as
possible towards monetary union,' he said.
In the interview, Mr Cavaco Silva:
Reaffirmed his commitment to the current parity of the escudo in the ERM, in
the face of recent market speculation against it;
Promised to press ahead with dismantling remaining exchange controls by the
end of the year, while watching carefully for further signs of speculation
within the country's banking system;
Called for continuing wage restraint by Portuguese employers and trade
unions and warned of spending cuts in the forthcoming budget.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: German ambassador told of UK
'concern'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday came within an ace of registering its first ever
diplomatic protest to a European Community country when the Foreign Office
called in the German ambassador in London to express its disapproval of the
way the Bundesbank had publicised its views on the sterling crisis.
Though the Foreign Office stressed that it had merely 'called in' and not
'summoned' the ambassador, Baron Hermann von Richthofen, and rigorously
avoided using the sensitive term 'protest', there was no mistaking the
message it was seeking to convey.
The official diplomatic terminology was sufficiently terse and to the point.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the minister of state at the Foreign Office, had
expressed 'the government's concern at the deliberate decision to disclose
Dr Schlesinger's (Bundesbank President Dr Helmut Schlesinger) letter, and to
make clear the government's view that the release of the document was
unhelpful.'
The document rebutted official British suggestions that the Bundesbank had
failed to give sterling sufficient support in foreign exchange markets
before it was floated. Its publication sparked off the latest in a series of
Anglo-German rows.
A German official in London said that the embassy had decided to disclose
the document with the consent of the Bundesbank. The adverse comment it had
provoked in the British media had come as a surprise. Far from wanting to
add fuel to the fire of Anglo-German relations, the intention behind the
release of the document was to be helpful by demonstrating that the
Bundesbank had offered substantial support to sterling.
The embassy's statement that the document was issued with the Bundesbank's
consent was disputed by a bank spokesman in Frankfurt. The Bundesbank had
merely intended to provide the embassy with arguments backing up the central
bank's position.
That assertion, however, did not tally with a statement put out by the
German Foreign Office in Bonn, which said: 'the release of Schlesinger's
statement was made in good faith and in accordance with the Bundesbank.'
Baron von Richthofen, a spokesman emphasised, had not acted on his own.
Both the German Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Office in London attempted
to pour oil on troubled waters by referring to the good atmosphere in which
Wednesday's meeting in Bonn between Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, his British opposite number, was held.
Though Mr Hurd had raised the issue of the letter at the meeting, the two
sides had underlined the need to overcome the differences which had arisen
over currency upheavals, British and German spokesmen said.

<TEXT>
Mr Hermann von Richthofen, Germany's ambassador to the UK, is an unfailingly
polite figure with an affection for most things British, writes David Marsh.
A distant relative of the Red Baron, the celebrated first world war fighter
ace, he enjoys relating accounts of his visit to an Oxford men's outfitters
where the owner insisted that his ancestor still owed money from a
long-forgotten clothing bill.
Mr von Richthofen's civilised manner and his experience - he was the German
Foreign Ministry's political director before he took up his London post -
have stood him in exemplary stead on the diplomatic circuit. He has been a
persistent advocate of the German government's proclaimed ambition of
forging European unity - above all, to prevent further fragmentation and
decline in the east.
His diplomatic mildness has not always endeared him to his ultimate master,
the rough-and-ready Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But Mr von Richthofen has
arguably been the best possible choice to represent united Germany on the UK
stage. He has been on particularly active duty during the past two years
trying to correct British prejudices about a resurgent united Germany.
Privately, he remains surprised by the ease with which anti-German
resentment flows to the surface of British politics and the media. He cannot
have enjoyed being called in by the Foreign Office yesterday to hear the
British government's concern at the embassy's 'deliberate decision' to
release Mr Schlesinger's document.
Mr von Richthofen, however, realises that politics demands an element of
play-acting. Even now that he has been told of Whitehall's displeasure,
neither his elegance nor his composure is likely to be too sorely ruffled.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: How UK currency sickened in a
poisonous atmosphere - Peter Norman, Economics Editor, recounts the
escalating war of words over sterling between the German Bundesbank and the
British Treasury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SUNDAY September 6 began miserably in Bath.
It was pouring with rain outside the city's elegant Royal Crescent Hotel.
Inside, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, appeared
distracted and anxious to get away. Nearby, Mr Norman Lamont, the host of a
weekend meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bankers,
had his nose buried in the day's newspapers and appeared not to notice his
distinguished guest.
If one episode was the catalyst for the extraordinary row that has since
blown up between the UK and Germany over monetary and economic policy, it
was that weekend meeting in Bath.
On the previous day, in the elegant surroundings of the city's 18th-century
Assembly Rooms, the UK chancellor abandoned the wide-ranging agenda that he
had set for the talks and pressed Mr Schlesinger to cut his interest rates.
Mr Lamont, rightly, saw this as the key to boosting economic growth in
Europe and especially in Britain, where the government was faced with the
prospect of a recession turning into a slump. The chancellor was a man under
pressure, with a weakening pound in the European exchange rate mechanism and
the absence of any sign of an end to the UK's prolonged recession.
Eight days later, after the surprise Italian lira devaluation of September
13, the Bundesbank obliged, with a minimal  1/4 -point cut in its
internationally important Lombard rate to 9 1/2 per cent and a  1/2 -point
cut in Germany's discount rate to 8 1/4 per cent. But in Bath Mr
Schlesinger, as just one member of the bank's 18-man ruling council, was in
no position to deliver the chancellor's wishes.
Mr Lamont's insistence was so fierce that the 68-year-old Bundesbank chief
was on the point of walking out of the meeting. He was held back when Mr
Theo Waigel, the Bonn finance minister, urged Mr Lamont to call off his
attacks.
Mr Lamont nevertheless came away from the discussions proclaiming victory.
The meeting had agreed a four-point statement that confirmed the then
existing exchange rate structure of the ERM and included a Bundesbank
promise not to increase interest rates 'in present circumstances'. But the
hollowness of Mr Lamont's achievement soon became apparent after the
Bundesbank president on the following day distanced himself from the
agreement not to realign the ERM exchange rates.
But Bath alone cannot explain the bitter divisions that have emerged between
Mr Lamont and Mr Schlesinger and pitched the UK Treasury against the
independent Bundesbank.
It is now clear that the divergence of the two economies under the impact of
German unification imposed intolerable strains on the relationship between
two countries that were once natural allies in European economic and
monetary affairs.
By the late summer, the UK government was convinced that the ERM was forcing
it to maintain a stricter monetary discipline than was warranted by the
depressed state of the domestic economy. It had earlier weighed the
possibility of a devaluation but rejected it in a widely publicised speech
by the chancellor in July. Not only would a devaluation be politically risky
it would also shatter the government's efforts to make sterling a strong
currency.
At the same time, the Bundesbank, alarmed by Germany's fiscal deficits and
the cost of reconstructing east Germany, saw no scope for a relaxation of
its interest rates.
This lack of economic convergence was exacerbated by somewhat differing
perceptions in Frankfurt and London of the way in which the ERM should
operate. The scene was therefore set for the Treasury and the Bundesbank to
differ sharply in their assessment of events that led up to 'Black
Wednesday', September 16, when sterling was forced to leave the ERM.
These differences show through in the statements issued two days ago by the
Bundesbank and the British Treasury. The two statements show no meeting of
minds over the immediate causes of sterling's departure from the ERM in the
days following the lira's devaluation in the European Monetary System.
The British government firmly believes that the final straw for sterling was
the contentious interview given by Mr Schlesinger to Handelsblatt, the
German business daily, early in the week of Black Wednesday. In line with
frequent German practice, a condensed advance copy of the interview was made
available to the German press by Handelsblatt on the evening of Tuesday,
September 15. This contained the remark, attributed to Mr Schlesinger, that
'the situation in the EMS could have been further eased if there had been a
more comprehensive realignment' at the time of the lira devaluation.
This, according to the UK, caused sterling to crash through its DM2.778 ERM
floor in late trading on Tuesday after which it proved impossible to support
the parity on Black Wednesday despite two emergency increases in British
interest rates to 15 per cent from 10 per cent. The Bundesbank eventually
disowned the remarks but too late to influence financial markets.
This week's statement from the Bundesbank failed to recognise the UK
concerns about the supposed statement from Mr Schlesinger. Instead, it
underlined how Mr Schlesinger, in the final version of the interview as
published on September 17, made remarks supportive of the pound. The German
statement failed to acknowledge that by that time sterling had been forced
out of the ERM.
The episode indicates that the German authorities are at best naive in
assuming that markets will wait to react only to authoritative versions of
interviews. By the time the first condensed version of Mr Schlesinger's
supposed remarks emerged there were already widespread suspicions that the
Bundesbank had wanted a broader ERM realignment than the lire devaluation of
September 13.
In part, these suspicions reflected Mr Schlesinger's cool reaction to the
Bath communique promising no ERM realignment on September 5. They also
mirrored a general awareness that the Bundesbank had been increasingly
unhappy at the way the EMS - under the pressure of the drive in the EC to
economic and monetary union - had become a system of quasi-fixed exchange
rates since its last major realignment in January 1987.
These background factors gained added weight from suggestions circulating in
financial markets that Germany had actively sought a sterling devaluation in
the weekend talks in which the lira's devaluation was decided.
On this point, the Bundesbank and UK Treasury positions also appear opposed.
This week's Bundesbank statement indicates that the German central bank at
least thought a formal sterling devaluation was justified after it had
applied to the federal government in Bonn on September 11 for negotiations
among the EMS countries on a realignment. The UK Treasury said on Wednesday
night that 'no request was made by the German authorities to the UK that
weekend that it, too, should realign'.
According to monetary officials involved in the weekend talks (who
incidentally are neither German nor British), the Bundesbank did want
sterling to be devalued. But it did not go so far as formally to request
such a move. According to one official, both the Spanish and UK authorities
were 'sounded out' to see whether they would follow the Italian move, but
nothing came of these approaches.
This is a plausible explanation for a crucial mystery surrounding the events
leading to Black Wednesday. However, no confirmation of the 'soundings' has
been forthcoming from Frankfurt. Yesterday, the UK Treasury insisted that
'neither the German government nor the Bundesbank had proposed that sterling
be devalued along with the lira'.
There is a clear imbalance between this week's statements from the
Bundesbank and Treasury. The bulk of the bank's statement concerns the
nature and amount of support given to sterling by the German central bank.
It underlines that D-Mark sales in support of sterling were the largest
compulsory interventions ever undertaken for any partner currency in the
EMS. It is understood that the support of sterling exceeded in volume terms
the support provided for the French franc last week.
On the other hand, the UK Treasury statement pays scant attention to what
clearly was a very major effort to support sterling by the Bundesbank.
The obsession of Mr Lamont and the Treasury with the events immediately
before Black Wednesday conveniently obscures the more fundamental weaknesses
of sterling that forced it to leave the ERM.
The UK's weaknesses were not lost on Mr Schlesinger, who is above all an
economist. As foreign exchange market tensions began to build ahead of the
September 20 French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, he was heard
increasingly to express concern inside the Bundesbank at the UK's growing
trade deficit at a time of prolonged recession.
He would recall that the ERM was established in 1979 as a system of fixed
but adjustable parities. Later, after the crisis of sterling's departure
from the system, he used a press conference in Washington at the time of the
annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to express
his wish that the ERM could return to the principles of its founding fathers
with an acceptance that parity changes, if necessary, should be carried
through in a timely manner and without crisis.
The Bundesbank's guiding light is the so-called Basle-Nyborg agreement of
September 1987, in which EC ministers and central banks agreed some changes
to the rules of the ERM which were designed to ensure that the costs of
defending an unrealistic parity should fall on the weak currency countries
in the system.
The Basle-Nyborg agreement established that intervention to protect a
currency should ideally be carried out above its ERM floor and that resort
should be made to interest rate increases to support a soft currency in the
system once its weakness became dangerously apparent. The Bundesbank also
interpreted Basle-Nyborg as a reaffirmation of its right, negotiated in
1978, to be able to call on the Bonn government to negotiate a realignment
of parities when tensions in the system were becoming too strong.
On these criteria, the management of the ERM was found by the Bundesbank to
be wanting in the increasingly volatile trading conditions of August and
September. The British authorities, for example, were both unwilling and
politically unable to raise interest rates in August, despite sterling's
weakness against other ERM currencies. The French government persistently
refused to allow a relignment of currencies, arguing, until the system began
to break apart, that no such measure should be permitted before the
Maastricht referendum. In the final days before sterling's departure from
the system, the UK authorities failed to hold the pound above the lower
intervention point against the D-Mark and let it fall its floor.
For these reasons the German authorities appeared less than mortified when
sterling finally succumbed to speculative pressures and quit the ERM. Their
attitude was not lost on a British government that had anchored its entire
economic policy and political prestige on a sterling parity of DM2.95.
However, it is unlikely that relations between Germany and the UK would have
deteriorated so far without the poisoning of personal relations between Mr
Lamont and Mr Schlesinger. The UK's brief experiment with a fixed exchange
rate regime has foundered in mutual recriminations between Mr Lamont, who is
fighting to preserve his job, and Mr Schlesinger,who is striving to
safeguard his reputation as the guardian of German monetary stability.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Schlesinger caught out by desire
to have the last word
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOGGEDNESS and attention to detail stand out among the characteristics
which, during a 40-year career, have made Mr Helmut Schlesinger a successful
central banker. Both traits have come to the fore with a vengeance in the
document at the centre of the latest Anglo-German row - and both seem, for
the moment at least, to have rebounded against him.
Mr Schlesinger, 68, is a courtly man with more than a touch of Bavarian
charm. But he has a habitual liking - which some colleagues on the
decision-making Bundesbank council can find irritating - for having the last
word.
During the last fortnight, the normally unflappable Mr Schlesinger has been
enraged by attacks from Britain both on the Bundesbank's interest rate
policies and - still worse - on his own integrity. He has been especially
hurt by recent articles in British tabloid newspapers linking the Bundesbank
to Germany's Nazi past. The four-page statement on 'reproaches made by some
members of the British government' was his attempt to hit back.
Unfortunately for him, Mr Schlesinger's perhaps justified righteous
indignation over the events of the last two weeks has now been drowned in
the greater tumult engendered by the new affair. Seldom can an attempt to
put the record straight have produced such a twisted result.
Mr Schlesinger is certainly no conspirator. When he tries to persuade
recalcitrant Bundesbank council members of the merits of a policy they find
unconvincing, his obvious lack of Machiavellian instincts can border on
haplessness. 'Too honest for his own good' was one description after the
controversial interview with Handelsblatt, the German financial daily, which
the UK government charges helped prompt sterling's exit from the exchange
rate mechanism.
A man with a somewhat unworldly lack of understanding for the way that
journalists work, he has tried to use the press to protect his well-founded
reputation for straightforwardness, decency and prudence. Yet he has somehow
managed to end up in the dock appearing to be not only a weaver of intrigue
but an unsuccessful one to boot.
In the Bundesbank, Mr Schlesinger's reputation for homespun scholarliness is
wiswspread.
He has never become familiar with word processors, and writes out articles
and speeches long-hand with a pen. His stamina is prodigious. On the evening
of the Bundesbank's landmark cut in its Lombard rate on September 14, Mr
Schlesinger travelled to Kiel in north German to deliver an exhaustive
23-page speech, replete with footnotes, on 'progress in European monetary
integration' - which gave the most thorough theoretical explanation to date
of why the Bundesbank was seeking a devaluation of weaker currencies in the
EMS.
Nothing in Mr Schlesinger's career prepared him for the peculiar challenges
he has faced since he unexpectedly took over the Bundesbank presidency last
August. The task of steering Germany through the reunification shoals, while
at the same time trying to keep the country on track for the politically
necessary goal of European integration, has been much tougher than imagined.
Mr Karl Otto Pohl, Mr Schlesinger's predecessor, who quit in full knowledge
of the sizeable problems bequeathed to his former deputy, has considerably
more experience in negotiating political quicksands. The more flexible Mr
Pohl, a former journalist, would probably have handled the vicissitudes of
the past few months matters with greater aplomb, according to officials who
know both men well.
Although also sensitive to criticism, Mr Pohl would probably have shrugged
off the latest barbs, knowing that action to blunt them would have prolonged
the pain.
Even the astute Mr Pohl, however, owed his downfall ultimately to his
failure to find a modus vivendi with Chancellor Helmut Kohl over the
financing of German unity. Far more than a consequence of any personal
failing, Mr Schlesinger's setback is clearly a result, above all, of the
extraordinary pressures which go with the job.
At today's Bundesbank press conference in Schwerin, northern Germany, Mr
Schlesinger will have a further chance to set the record straight. September
has been one of the toughest months of his life. Although some associates
say the pressure he has faced might make him consider resignation, the most
likely outcome is that Mr Schlesinger will soldier on until his planned
departure next summer.
The risk, for him, is that the evident toughness of the Bundesbank's uphill
struggle will, by then, leave Mr Schlesinger looking not so much dogged as
simply worn out.

FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Spanish minister accuses Moody's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN financial tensions settled on Spain yesterday after Moody's
announced a review of Madrid's credit rating amid renewed speculation about
a peseta devaluation.
The unrelieved strength of the D-Mark kept the peseta close to its ERM
floor. The government denied rumours of another devaluation, but the peseta
closed at Pta70.42 (39p), close to its ERM floor of Pta72.62.
On the Madrid stock exchange investors ignored angry finance ministry
rejections of Moody's decision, and drove the general index to its lowest
level in six years.
Mr Pedro Perez, secretary of state for the economy, said that Moody's had
made an 'erroneous' appreciation of Spain's credit worthiness and that its
conclusions were 'not based on reality'.
On Wednesday night the US credit agency said it was reviewing a possible
downgrade of the Kingdom of Spain's current AA2 rating because of the
'accumulation of imbalances' in the Spanish economy and the 'less favourable
external environment'.
Madrid's already depressed stock exchange tumbled yesterday and the index
dropped 4.4 per cent, its biggest fall of the year, to close at 185 points.
'Moody's announcement was the last straw, all the market needed to wipe out
confidence,' said Mr Peter Stephens of Barclays securities house in Madrid.
The Bolsa index is now back to its August 1986 level, at the point where it
stood before the market began to perform strongly on the back of Spain's
entry into the EC earlier that year.
Mr Perez said Moody's decision to review Spain's rating did not take account
of recent moves - such as the 1993 budget which was unveiled this week - to
rectify financial imbalances.
'They (Moody's) could not have analysed the budget in depth because they had
not the time to do so,' he said.
The 1993 budget, said by the government to be the toughest in 20 years,
restricts central government spending increases to only 3.7 per cent - a
fall in real terms. The tough budget is likely to push up unemployment next
year by 300,000 to beyond the 3m level.
The secretary of state implied that Moody's had confused Spain with Italy,
whose rating was reduced by two points by the US agency last month. 'There
is simply no point of comparison, in political terms or in terms of any
economic ratio, between Spain and Italy,' Mr Perez said.
Mr David Levey, head of Moody's sovereign risk unit, said it was not Moody's
practise to debate public officials. 'We have announced a review, not a
conclusion' Mr Levey said. 'We have pointed to fundamental areas of concern
that are not determined by the details of a single budget.'
Opening a debate in parliament yesterday on the ratification of the
Maastricht treaty, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, said there was 'no cause
and effect' between economic problems in Spain and the construction of
Europe.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Kerry reaches for jugular: Bank of England and US Justice
Department heavily criticised Auditors' lack of co-operation with committee
condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE KERRY report is a mountainous document, bulging with allegations about
BCCI's heinous crimes and the failings of its regulators and accountants.
It pulls few punches in its criticism of the Bank of England, BCCI's
auditors Price Waterhouse and its major shareholders Abu Dhabi, all of which
will provide ammunition to the many people who have suffered at BCCI's
hands.
In the best tradition of congressional reports, it picks over its subject in
meticulous detail and reaches for the jugular. Anyone sated with fraud can
gorge on prostitution, terrorism, drug trafficking, bribery and death squads
or ponder the complexities of the fraudster's mind as detailed in its 786
pages.
But the real judgment that needs to be made is how much light Senator Kerry
sheds on the chief questions behind this extraordinary affair.
Although he draws useful lessons and proposes important legislative
initiatives, the overall result is less satisfactory. There are few
illuminating insights, which is disappointing for an investigation that had
powers to subpoena evidence - although not surprising, perhaps, given the
thick veil of secrecy that still surrounds key parts of the story.
In seeking to answer the central question of how BCCI got away with massive
fraud as long as it did, three points need to be addressed:
When did Price Waterhouse first detect evidence of fraud?
Should the bank regulators have shut it down earl-ier?
How much did Abu Dhabi know?
On the first of those, many of PW's early audits of BCCI dating from the
early 1980s have been in the public domain for more than a year. They show
that loans remained unserviced, clients disappeared, documents went missing.
Yet it was not until 1990 that PW officially reported that some transactions
were 'false or deceitful'.
Like many people who have read these audits with the light of hindsight, Mr
Kerry finds it hard to believe that they did not ring deafening alarm bells
at PW. But the audits provide only a blurred picture of what was happening
at PW, and whatever further evidence exists remains locked away in PW's
safe, beyond the reach even of Mr Kerry's subpoenas.
The result is that Mr Kerry seems unsure what to make of PW. He contends:
'There can be no question that the auditing process failed to work,' yet he
grants that PW's auditors detected fraud and reported it to the Bank of
England even though they were being obstructed at crucial turns by BCCI
itself. In a pointed comment he says: 'Price Waterhouse wound up owing a
duty principally to the people who were deceiving it.'
Mr Kerry is clearer on the point of whether bank regulators could have acted
sooner. The answer is yes. The Bank of England has always argued that it had
only partial responsibility for BCCI because it was headquartered in
Luxembourg.
But in one of the few new documents to emerge from the report, Mr Kerry
quotes from a 1985 Bank memo in which an official writes: 'After spending
one week in BCCI I am absolutely certain that the real head office is
located on six floors of 100 Leadenhall Street (in London).'
The Kerry report is especially critical of the bank regulators' decision in
early 1990 to discount evidence of fraud and accept a huge capital injection
from Abu Dhabi to keep BCCI going. That amounts, he says, to the regulators
and auditors becoming 'partners not in crime but in a cover-up'.
However, the real issue here is whether the authorities were doing a service
to the depositors by staving off a bank collapse and securing fresh capital
from the major shareholder.
The question of Abu Dhabi's involvement depends on whether you believe PW's
assertion that BCCI management confessed their crimes to Abu Dhabi officials
in early 1990. Abu Dhabi denies that, but Mr Kerry accepts it, although
without apparently having acquired any corroborating evidence of his own.
Until all the evidence does come out into the open, anyone trying to make
sense of BCCI has to decide which of many conflicting versions to believe.
Mr Kerry lays considerable store by Mr Masihur Rahman, BCCI's financial
officer, who testified before his committee last year.
Mr Rahman claimed to be totally ignorant of the frauds until the very end.
That may be true. But if Mr Kerry suggests that PW was remiss in not
spotting fraud sooner, consistency demands that he at least raise the same
question about Mr Rahman.
A note of frustration runs through the report, reflecting Mr Kerry's
inability to nail the full story of BCCI. The Serious Fraud Office, the Bank
of England, PW and Abu Dhabi come in for constant criticism for their
alleged obstructiveness, and he calls for greater international
co-op-eration.
That is not just the reaction of a politically driven individual. US
government agencies and congressional investigators have been ahead of their
British counterparts throughout the BCCI affair, and have played a key role
in publicising evidence that might otherwise have been buried by foreign
banking laws and court procedures.
The Kerry report will doubtless have its repercussions on Capitol Hill. But
it still leaves crucial gaps which interested parties must now hope will be
filled by the long-awaited Bingham Report in the UK.
The BCCI Affair: A Report to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations;
Senator John Kerry and Senator Hank Brown, Subcommittee on Terrorism,
Narcotics and International Operations.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE KERRY REPORT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Findings:
 -BCCI constituted international financial crime on a massive and global
scale
 -The bank systematically bribed world leaders and political figures
throughout the world
 -It developed and implemented a strategy to infiltrate the US banking
system despite regulatory barriers
 -US federal law enforcement agencies made decisions which delayed the
making of a wide case against BCCI
 -New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's investigation of BCCI
indirectly brought about its global closure
 -BCCI's accountants failed to protect its innocent depositors and
creditors
 -The CIA developed important information on BCCI, but inadvertently
failed to disseminate it
 -Gaps in the regulatory process partly caused flawed decisions by US
regulators and enabled BCCI to acquire US banks
 -The Bank of England's regulation of BCCI was wholly inadequate to
protect depositors and creditors
 -Clark Clifford and Robert Altman participated in improprieties with
BCCI in the US
 -Abu Dhabi's involvement in BCCI was more central than it has
acknowledged
 -BCCI actively solicited the friendships of major US political figures,
and made payments which may have been improper
 -BCCI's commodities affiliate Capcom engaged in billions of dollars of
largely anonymous trading in the US which included a very substantial
level of money laundering
Recommendations:
 -The US should develop a more aggressive and co-ordinated approach to
combat international financial crime
 -The US should develop a more aggressive approach to isolate
financially nations which do not adequately regulate their banks
 -Further steps should be taken to insure adequate accountability of
foreign financial institutions doing business in the US
 -Foreign investors who buy substantial shares of US businesses should
be able required to appear personally in the US
 -The inspector-general of the US Justice Department should investigate
the policies and practices that led to problems in the department's
BCCI investigation
 -The CIA and State Department should target foreign financial
institutions as subjects for intelligence gathering and analysis
 -Congress should consider adopting additional oversight mechanisms to
ensure the CIA's accountability on the provision of information
 -Federal agencies should impose new requirements on forein auditors to
protect US interests
 -The president and secretary of state should protest to the government
of Abu Dhabi over the witholding of documents and witnesses
 -The judiciary committee should evaluate whether it is appropriate to
create a federal statutory code of conduct for attorneys who practice
before federal agencies
 -The US commodities market should make money laundering illegal and
demand that this requirement is accepted by foreign commodities
exchanges
 -A committee of law enforcement officials should oversee, prevent and
respond to failures of co-operation
 -A statutory mechanism for the receipt by Congress of foreign financial
information should be established

FT  02 OCT 92 / US Report into BCCI: Price Waterhouse doubly criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE comes in for criticism in the Kerry report in equal measure
for its role as auditor to BCCI and for its lack of co-operation with the
committee in providing information.
The bulk of the analysis concentrates on why BCCI was allowed to continue
operating in spite of alleged fraud and bad practices which went back over
many years.
Using fragments of PW papers obtained by the committee, it says the firm was
raising concerns over the operations of the BCCI Grand Cayman office at
least as far back as 1983, when it highlighted 'a high concentration of
risk' in loans to prominent clients.
In 1984, it noted files containing 'inadequate financial information such
that the credit worthiness of the borrow(er) cannot be readily established'.
PW made a series of recommendations for reform. The Kerry report says that
BCCI did not abide by many of these points, which were reiterated in greater
detail every year by PW. Meanwhile the firm continued to sign off the
accounts as 'true and fair'.
In its 1987 audit report, PW said the repayment performance was 'below
expectations' of loans for Dollars 318m to the Gokal brothers and their
shipping empire, the Gulf Group. It said security against the lending was
probably unenforceable and financial information on the loans 'inadequate'.
The report estimates that PW received about Dollars 5m a year for its work
on the BCCI audit and related services. It says the UK PW firm declined to
co-operate in providing information because of the restrictions precluded by
banking confidentiality.
It adds that the firm did offer to allow members of the Kerry committee to
interview partners in London, but its rules on staff travel did not permit
this while the lack of any sub-poenaed documents would have made the value
of the trip marginal.

FT  02 OCT 92 / US Report into BCCI: Morgenthau's office wins lavish praise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the myriad US institutions involved in the investigation and
regulation of BCCI, only one is the subject of consistent praise in the
Kerry report - the office of Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district
attorney.
But for Mr Morgenthau's work, the Bank of England 'might well have proceeded
with BCCI's restructuring regardless of the new revelations about fraud, and
simply hoped for the best', the report said.
Mr Morgenthau, who brought the first wide-ranging fraud charges against BCCI
in July last year, is singled out as having been far ahead of US or British
authorities in uncovering criminality at BCCI and credited with having
essentially forced both the Bush administration and the Bank of England into
taking action against BCCI in the period leading up to the bank's shutdown
in July last year.
In the end, the report remarks, it was not the regulatory process itself
that brought about the exposure and removal of BCCI from either the US or
the UK. The ultimate regulatory action was prompted by the criminal
investigation brought by Mr Morgenthau.
On August 21 1989, the Federal Reserve was told by an aide to Mr Morgenthau
that an informant had reported that BCCI had secret control of First
American Bankshares, the Washington bank then chaired by Mr Clark Clifford,
the former US defence secretary. The Fed took no action in response,
according to the Kerry report. It did learn more in late 1989 about ties
between BCCI and First American from the Bank of England.
But for Mr Morgenthau's work, the Kerry report concludes, the Fed might
never have learned from the Bank of England, Price Waterhouse and Abu Dhabi
that auditors to BCCI had found damaging evidence on the bank.
If Mr Morgenthau is singled out for praise, the US Department of Justice,
the US Treasury and the Central Intelligence Agency are sharply censured in
the Kerry report. The Fed is described as having been negligent during much
of the 1980s, but is praised for its work since January 1991.
In investigating BCCI, the Fed's efforts were, according to the report,
hampered by a lack of co-operation by foreign governments and agencies,
including the Serious Fraud Office in the UK and, since the BCCI closure,
the government of Abu Dhabi.
The SFO is accused of having prevented the Fed from interviewing certain
witnesses and reviewing certain documents in the UK. Although Abu Dhabi has
claimed that it is co-operating with the US, the Kerry report says the
government's refusal to make available 18 witnesses and many important
documents has gravely hindered the Fed's ability to complete its BCCI
investigations.
The Justice Department, the report says, 'essentially stopped investigating
BCCI in connection with First American after the spring of 1990, until press
accounts, Fed action and the New York district attorney's investigation
pushed them into action in the spring of 1991'. The report even cites
evidence of one federal prosecutor who acknowledged making
misrepresentations to Fed officials and to Mr Morgenthau's office concerning
the existence of documents critical to their work.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Franco told to take over in Brazil today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was such concern in Brazil yesterday over the power vacuum at the top
that the Senate insisted Vice-President Itamar Franco take over as acting
president today.
Last night, there was still no-one named to occupy the crucial new finance
ministry in the incoming administration, but Mr Francisco Gros, Central Bank
president, said he had been asked to stay on.
Mr Franco had asked for a delay in his take-over until Monday because of
difficulties in choosing, as head of the finance ministry, someone
acceptable to the wide range of parties supporting him.
The Senate decision left Mr Franco rushing to finish compiling his cabinet.
His spokesman said that he would not assume power without having named a
finance minister.
His task was helped last night when the two main parties disputing - the
Democratic Movement (PMDB) and the Social Democrats (PSDB) - agreed to stop
vetoing names. For the last two days, they had been wrangling bitterly over
the finance portfolio.
The first choice of Mr Jose Serra, an economist from the social democratic
PSDB party, was vetoed by Mr Orestes Quercia, leader of the Democratic
Movement party (PMDB). He believes that, as the largest party, the PMDB
should command the finance ministry.
Mr Franco seemed impatient with the in-fighting yesterday: 'I choose the
ministers. Anyone who thinks he can pressure me is fooling himself.'
The failure to name a finance minister and, while Mr Gros's position was
still in doubt, a Central Bank chief, was causing concern in the financial
community, anxious for word on future economic policy. The main Sao Paulo
stock market was operating 1.1 per cent down yesterday afternoon in quiet
trading, but closed up 4.8 per cent on news that the acting president would
be installed today.
The socialist Senator Jose Bisol yesterday criticised the delay: 'We are
running the risk of disappointing the nation which took to the streets in
favour of impeachment' of President Fernando Collor, newly on trial by the
senate on corruption charges.
The delay left him still in office, despite the vote by the House of
Representatives on Tuesday to strip the president of his powers and send him
to a Senate trial. He spent yesterday in his offices, where he could still
nominate appointees and issue decrees until he has signed the papers
required to suspend him from office for 180 days during the trial.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Texans cool towards Perot, the native son: Jurek Martin
samples views around a would-be candidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the campaign of 1964, one of the more scurrilous tracts passed round the
Barry Goldwater faithful was a little paperback entitled A Texan Looks at
Lyndon Johnson. Mostly, it looked and found he was a communist.
As they waited for his long-pondered decision, finally announced last night,
to re-enter the 1992 presidential race, many Texans were contemplating
another native son, Ross Perot.
Take, for example, William P Hobby, until 1990 lieutenant-governor, an
office with real power in Texas, and now a professor at the LBJ school of
government of the University of Texas. He has had dealings with Mr Perot for
over 20 years and concedes that his role in reforming state education a
decade ago was one of 'great service'.
But, he caustically goes on, 'most men's mid-life crises are not nearly as
spectacular as his.' He may be 'the worst qualified man ever to want to be
president'. As to motivation, 'something rattles his chains' and he has to
break out. He suspects, as does Dave McNeely, political columnist on the
Austin Statesman-American, that, however Mr Perot dresses it up, he is
inspired by a genuine and profound hatred of President George Bush.
But, Mr Hobby adds: 'Who the hell knows?'
Some demonic theorists, more in Washington than Texas, claim they do and
that the adopted and native Texan duo, George Bush and 'Jimmy' Baker, have
deliberately baited Mr Perot in order to get him to run and thus complicate
an election that the president seemed otherwise certain to lose.
Neither Mr Hobby nor Mr McNeely thinks that Mr Perot can regain, even in
Texas, anything like the levels of support he commanded in the heady
springtime days of his non-candidacy. Mr McNeely thinks, but says he does
not know, that in the end Mr Perot will launch something short of a fully
fledged campaign, but sufficient to keep his name in the spotlight and on
television and thus satisfy his ego.
Mr Robert Stein of Rice University in Houston is, according to Mr Hobby, the
pre-eminent Texas pollster. His latest surveys have not been posited on a
Perot entry, but he has been tracking him for months.
He concedes that Mr Perot still has a base in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,
particularly among retired military people; he thinks his candidacy makes
Texas more competitive, because it helps Mr Bush in the first instance,
though not perhaps in the longer haul.
But he has doubts that Mr Perot will get back to much beyond 10 per cent on
his home soil from the 5 per cent-plus that he has recently been
registering. That, of course, might be enough to determine who does win the
state.
Mr James Galbraith, the Texas University economist, is more engaged with
what a President Bill Clinton should do than with the intricacies of Texas
politics, but is convinced that here, as in Florida and elsewhere, Mr Perot
can only in the end hurt Mr Bush.
But three others of progressive persuasion - Molly Ivins, the journalist
whose acid chronicles of Ross Perot have lightened many a breakfast table
this year; Jim Hightower, former Texas agricultural commissioner who, under
no circumstances, he promises, will be the next secretary of agriculture;
and Susan DeMarco, the liberal activist - seemed glum at the thought that he
might be running again.
They agreed with Ms Ivins's guess that he might indeed get 10 per cent,
perhaps a little more, but were far more interested in talking about what
has been happening in Europe.
Mr McNeely is convinced that a lot of the nasty stories about Mr Perot's
autocratic ways, which were beginning to gain currency when he pulled out in
July, will resurface with a vengeance with a few more revelations besides.
One concerns the alleged surveillance of his own daughter, who was going out
with a professor who happened to be Jewish. Another is his apparent tendency
to fire employees with the HIV virus. A third is that he ordered
investigations of some of his volunteers.
But this week there have been stories which appear to contradict his
fundamental claim that his is a genuine 'bottoms-up' grass roots movement.
Some leading 'volunteers' are in fact on his payroll.
Some of those he disappointed now claim he always intended to pull an
'October surprise'. It certainly is the case that in July he advised the
Texas authorities that his name was not to be withdrawn from the ballot.
But perhaps the most damaging and irrefutable evidence concerns his
toll-free telephone number, which he invited all to use to say whether he
should, or should not, get into the race. Anybody dialling it gets an
automated response advising that they 'will be included in our total count
of callers supporting Ross Perot'.
At least one of those was an anonymous reporter from the Austin
Statesman-American simply doing his checking. Whether because of this or
not, the newspaper's editorial column this week pulled no punches.
'It is hard to escape the feeling', it wrote delicately, 'that the entire
Ross Perot candidacy has been nothing but an ego trip by someone who thinks
unlimited money means the rules don't apply to him.' Thus Texans now look at
Ross Perot.

FT  02 OCT 92 / US purchasing managers' indexdives to 49%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PLUNGE in the purchasing managers' index, a closely watched indicator of
US business conditions, yesterday heightened speculation that the Federal
Reserve may soon be forced to cut interest rates again to stop the economy
sliding back into semi-recession.
The index fell 4.7 points to 49 per cent last month, taking it below the
psychologically weighty 50 per cent level for the first time since January.
A level below 50 per cent indicates the manufacturing sector is contracting.
The decline - much sharper than expected decline - mainly reflected
heightened pessimism about the outlook for US industrial orders.
Separately, the Commerce Department reported a 0.8 per cent decline in
construction spending in August, the largest monthly decline since November
1991 when a full-blown recession was under way. Claims for state
unemployment insurance jumped 15,000 to 429,000 - far above the levels
normally consistent with economic recovery.
The bleak figures - which followed recent reports of sharp declines in home
sales, consumer confidence, industrial orders and personal incomes  -
prompted a sharp gain in bond prices on anticipation of another easing move
by the Fed.
They also left analysts apprehensive before the release today of an
employment report that could dent President George Bush's re-election hopes.
Most analysts anticipate a politically embarrassing rise in the unemployment
rate, now 7.6 per cent nationally, perhaps into double digits in some
depressed states such as California. Non-farm employment is expected to fall
by about 75,000, after a big drop last month, although the figures will be
distorted by the ending of a temporary federal summer jobs programme.
A sharp decline in employment could spark another interest rate cut,
although the Fed will be wary of cutting the discount rate, now 3 per cent,
for fear of undermining the dollar. Many analysts, however, believe the Fed
may signal a quarter-point cut to 2.75 per cent in the federal funds rate in
the next few days.
The most worrying aspect of the purchasing managers' report was a collapse
in the component of the index measuring the strength of new orders. This
fell from 59.8 per cent in August to 49.6 per cent last month.
Mr Robert Bretz, purchasing managers spokesman, said the plunge indicated
the 'manufacturing sector could no longer sustain growth.' The 'economic
malaise will likely continue,' he predicted.

THE long-running scandal over Dollars 5bn of illegal Iraqi loans, made by
the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), took an
unexpected turn yesterday when a US judge halted court hearings against the
branch's former head and said he would order a full-scale trial.
Judge Marvin Shoob declared in open court that he did not believe the
central premise of the US government's case against Mr Christopher Drogoul,
former BNL Atlanta manager, who was due to have been sentenced to prison
this week.
The judge's order was in response to a request by US government prosecutors,
who this week suffered a series of blows to their case that Mr Drogoul was
the sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans. More than Dollars 2bn of these
helped finance President Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and missile
projects.
The prosecutors yesterday said they wished to seek a full trial and cancel
an earlier plea agreement by which Mr Drogoul had admitted guilt to 60 of
347 charges against him. Two weeks ago, Mr Bobby Lee Cook, Mr Drogoul's
lawyer, was refused a full trial and a request that his client's plea be
changed to innocent.
Mr Cook, who quickly agreed to a new trial, has accused the Bush
administration of covering up its role in a scheme to finance Iraq's weapons
programmes via BNL loans.
The government's case appeared weakened this week after Judge Shoob had
revealed that three CIA documents proved 'definitely' that Mr Drogoul had
acted with the full knowledge of BNL's head office in Rome.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Hiten Dalal, all the figures in
his head
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hiten Dalal, a distant cousin of Bhupen Dalal, is neither debonair nor
flamboyant. He doesn't need a calculator or paper to handle figures. Widely
acknowledged as a financial wizard, this unassuming broker appears to have
all the numbers stored in his head. He lives so simply that he does not even
have a telephone at home, zealously guarding his privacy.
The broker with the largest dealings with Standard Chartered Bank was not
even listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, having acquired his trading
authority from the northern town of Kanpur, though he has no other apparent
links with the place.
Standard Chartered Bank executives say four cheques worth Rs780m were found
in the office drawers of Arvind Mohan Lal, the treasury manager in the bank
who first alerted the bank to the irregularities and was later dismissed.
The cheques were made out to SCB from Hiten Dalal's account in Andhra Bank,
but they bounced when they were presented.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Bhupen Dalal, antithesis of the
average
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bhupen Chapaklal Dalal is one of Bombay's best-known brokers, with a
background in stark contrast to Harshad Mehta's. A formidable player in the
government securities market, Dalal is the antithesis of the average Bombay
stocker, and would look more comfortable in Wall Street. Bhupen Dalal's
Champaklal Investment and Finance Corporation has handled some of the
country's largest and most prestigious equity offerings, and the man sees
himself as something of a philanthropist and business tycoon. Deeply
religious, the suave broker would spend many hours in jail doing his prayers
and rituals, and resents the fact that he is not allowed to leave Bombay
while on bail to visit a temple town in South India. Dalal insists he had no
dealings with Standard Chartered, and was only brought in when they
discovered the mess, to help sort it out. The Reserve Bank suspended the
securities trading permit of his firm after Standard Chartered accused Dalal
of fraud in its criminal complaint. According to the investigators, a large
number of transactions have been put through in the account of one of
Dalal's firms, Bhupen Champaklal Devidas, though Dalal pleads not guilty.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Harshad Mehta, determined to
clear his name
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Harshad Mehta, the former Big Bull of the Bombay stock market, looks a
shadow of his old self, writes Stefan Wagstyll in Bombay. After three months
of interrogation, he has lost a stone in weight, his once chubby cheeks have
sunk, and dark patches have appeared beneath his eyes.
But Mr Mehta has lost none of the confidence which won him many admirers and
not a few enemies. In an interview yesterday with the Financial Times, he
pledged to clear his name of allegations of fraud, to repay all his debts
and to go back to business in Dalal Street, the home of the Bombay Stock
Exchange.
'They are trying to make me a scapegoat, but I played only a small part in a
big market,' he says. 'The truth will come out.'
Mr Mehta was released from arrest last week after a gruelling 111 days in
custody where he was questioned about allegations that he defrauded banks
trading in the securities markets. Now he must spend seven hours a day at
the criminal board of investigation, which is probing the scandal. Outside
his luxury flat overlooking the sea sit six armed policemen. 'The government
is guarding me,' says Mr Mehta with a smile. 'They think I'm a valuable
commodity.'
His life has been brought to a standstill since the affair erupted in April
 -even the half-completed renovation of his flat. His records have been
seized, his assets frozen, including a fleet of 29 cars, among them his
favourite Toyota Lexus saloon. Mr Mehta once loved to be photographed in
front of it. Now it stands forlornly in the garage where he is not allowed
to touch it.
It is all a far cry from last year when 39-year-old Mr Mehta rode to fame
and fortune by aggressively promoting an unprecedented surge in the stock
market. His biggest killing was made in buying 5 per cent of Associated
Cement Corporation and helping to push the price from Rs350 in early 1991 to
a peak of Rs11,500. 'I showed people that, by accepting a little risk, you
could make 80-300 per cent instead of 12 per cent on a bank deposit.'
Mr Mehta was then the poor boy made rich, a quick-thinking trader who had
dealt in diamond and hosiery before turning to financial services in the
late 1970s. He secured his Bombay Stock Exchange seat in 1984. Seven years
later he was the best-known broker in India. As Mr Ashwin Mehta, his brother
and partner, says: 'Harshad is a man in a hurry.' Even now, Mr Mehta has
many fans. When he emerged from custody last week, he was mobbed outside the
courthouse.
However, Mr Mehta knows it will take more than popularity to get him out of
trouble - he declines to discuss the details of the affair, saying that it
might compromise his defence. Nevertheless, he angrily denounces the banks
for their role in the scandal, including Citibank, the US bank which until
the affair broke was the biggest trader in the inter-bank securities market.
Citibank has denied that its activities broke the law, though this week it
admitted to a parliamentary committee that it infringed some central bank
guidelines.
But even in his present predicament, Mr Mehta is also able to talk about the
affair dispassionately. The origin of the scandal, he says, lies in the fact
that 'financial reforms are overdue in this country, as both the capital and
money markets are over-regulated and governed by policies which market
players cannot observe.'
Inevitably, the Big Bull is bullish about India, arguing that 'India is an
economic miracle.'
Equally inevitably, Mr Mehta wants to play a part in that miracle and talks
confidently about linking with foreign brokers to channel funds into India.
The optimism seems absurd in the context of a daily visit to the
prosecutor's office. But Mr Mehta insists that he will be back. 'I've been
down before. Once I had to pledge my wife's jewellery.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Tale of strict rules, poor
enforcement and greed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE narrow lane outside the Bombay stock exchange, brokers spread piles
of application forms on car bonnets and urge passers-by to apply for the
latest offering of shares.
The slightest breeze whisks sheaves of paper into the air and sends brokers
scurrying to retrieve them. Street vendors do brisk business selling lunch
on the pavement to hundreds of men, young and old, milling around and
arguing over share prices. This is Dalal Street, the financial centre of
India.
Despite the decrepit telephone network and streets clogged with traffic,
Bombay throbs with commercial activity.
Inevitably, regulators find it hard to keep pace with practitioners. The
contrast between fast growth and slow-footed supervision is at the heart of
the Rs35bn (Pounds 717m) financial scandal which has rocked India this year.
The authorities promoted expansion of India's financial markets as a key
ingredient in the country's economic reform programme, but failed to
modernise supervisory systems at the same pace. India's scandal is an object
lesson for other developing countries.
The affair is being investigated by the Reserve Bank of India (the central
bank), the government's Central Bureau of Investigation, and a joint
parliamentary committee. Banks and brokers are so busy supplying information
to these agencies that they have time for little else. The committee alone
has demanded 50 copies of every relevant document.
The inquiries have revealed that the centre of abuse was an informal market
for the trading of securities between banks, in which stockbrokers acted as
middlemen.
Standard Chartered Bank, the British-owned institution which has been
operating in India for more than 130 years, has suffered the largest loss,
currently put at Rs8.9bn, though it hopes to recover some of its money
through legal action.
Other hard-hit banks include State Bank of India, largest of the
government-owned banks which dominate Indian banking, National Housing Bank,
a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank, and two small banks which have collapsed -
the Bank of Karad and the Metropolitan Co-operative Bank.
The affair erupted in April at the tail-end of a boom on the Bombay stock
market which saw prices rise three-fold in less than a year.
The central bank had been growing suspicious about how investors were
securing funds since loans for speculative investment are banned. A brief
strike by stockbrokers then disturbed settlement payments and revealed
discrepancies in accounts.
The authorities started a probe into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, a
39-year-old self-made broker who earned the nickname Big Bull for his part
in driving up share prices. Mr Mehta never discussed the source of his
funds, but investigators alleged the money was illegally diverted from banks
and charged Big Bull with fraud. He was arrested in June and freed on bail
in September.
As panic spread in the financial community in early May, dealings in the
stock market came to a standstill and banks re-examined their books.
To their horror, Standard Chartered, the State Bank of India and others
discovered evidence of heavy losses. The official investigations widened.
The criminal probes have focused on two targets - Mr Mehta, who was charged
with using forged documents to defraud banks, including the State Bank of
India; and a group of brokers and bankers centred upon Mr Bhupen Dalal,
doyen of Bombay's financiers and head of the country's largest brokerage,
who have been accused of defrauding Standard Chartered. Mr Mehta, Mr Dalal
and their co-accused deny the allegations, saying their extensive dealings
with the banks came from legitimate securities transactions.
The scandal's origin lay in India's tight banking regulations. Banks are
required to lodge 30 per cent (before April, 38 per cent) of their deposits
with the Reserve Bank in low-yielding government securities to help fund the
government's budget deficit. Another central bank rule sets an artificially
low ceiling on the maximum rates paid on deposits.
In order to maximise profits on their assets, banks started trading the
securities among themselves in short-term re-purchase agreements or 'repos',
which in India are called 'ready forwards'.
To attract funds, particularly from large corporations, banks established
'portfolio management schemes' on which they paid much higher rates of
interest. These funds were mostly invested in the inter-bank securities
market in order to maximise returns. The central bank estimates fully 26 per
cent of inter-bank trading was on behalf of investment clients.
The expansion of Indian banking markets, with the onset of financial
deregulation, stimulated 'repo' trading. Moreover, banks ignored central
bank rules and diversified the market from the legally sanctioned trade in
government bonds to paper issued by public corporations.
Foreign banks were particularly active, attracting top dealers with promises
of high pay and big bonuses. The Reserve Bank estimates that the four top
foreign banks - Citibank and Bank of America of the US, Standard Chartered
and ANZ Grindlays of Australia - accounted for 50 per cent of inter-bank
securities trading.
The champion was Citibank, which pioneered computer-managed trading and,
according to central bank figures, captured 56 per cent of the lucrative
portfolio management-related trade. A Reserve Bank report published in
August said banks including Citibank and Bank of America violated its
guidelines in a number of ways, in effect using portfolio management schemes
as deposit substitutes. Both banks denied wrongdoing.
While trading changed out of all recognition through rapid growth,
settlement procedures did not. The rules require securities transactions to
be painstakingly entered by hand in a central bank ledger. But the system is
so cumbersome that banks frequently stopped transferring the underlying
securities and instead issued receipts to each other via the brokers. When a
repurchased agreement ended, these bankers' receipts could be returned or
simply thrown away.
Traders had to think fast in a rapidly moving market. Stocks were rising
quickly in the year before the scandal but bond prices were falling, forced
down by successive interest rate increases.
This created three pressures on banks and brokers. First some were tempted
to sell bonds forward - to sell securities they did not yet own in the hope
of buying them back later at a cheaper price. Second, banks were tempted to
slip funds surreptitiously through brokers into the stock market, in
contravention of central bank rules. Third, some influential brokers, who
were dubbed the 'bear cartel' because they did not believe in the strength
of the equity boom, ran short of stock. They suffered heavy losses, which
banks - again by breaking rules - helped to finance.
The lack of an efficient settlement system allowed such transactions to be
disguised. Forgeries and photocopies circulated. Deals were done at
artificial prices to cover up losses or disguise transfers of funds to
brokers.
The central bank warned banks in a circular as early as July last year to
stop fictitious deals. But to no avail. One foreign banker says: 'I can't
think of any institution that didn't do this.'
In such turmoil, it was imperative for banks (and brokers) to have
first-class internal controls. However, no large Indian bank had computers
in its treasury, and nor did Standard Chartered. It is no coincidence that
the three other foreign banks all apparently escaped without serious
financial losses and all had computerised control of treasuries.
Aside from the investigations into Mr Mehta and the alleged fraud at
Standard Chartered the Indian authorities have set their sights on other
targets:
The joint parliamentary committee is seeking to establish the extent to
which the reserve bank tolerated abuses. The committee has found that though
the central bank had issued specific warnings to banks in July 1991 it was
aware that the rules on securities trading were still being flouted
afterwards.
The committee is gunning for foreign banks, an easy prey in nationalistic
India. Citibank is a favourite target, as it was a pioneer in the market.
Appearing before the committee this week, Citibank executives denied being
involved in any frauds.
But they admitted violating a central bank ban on accepting portfolio
management funds from state-owned enterprises. They also admitted using
Vijay Bank, a small Indian bank, as an agent to gather funds from
state-owned enterprises. These are important concessions, as Citibank had
previously denied claims levelled by the central bank that it had violated
guidelines.
The Indian press is keen to unearth links between the scandal and public
figures. So far, only two national figures have had to resign, both over
financial links with brokers involved in the affair. They are Mr P
Chidambaram, the commerce minister and a keen advocate of economic reform,
and Mr V Krishnamurthy, a former leading public sector industrialist and
technocrat.
Amid all the detail, Indians retain a keen sense of the ambitions which
fuelled the affair. As Mr R Janakiraman, deputy reserve bank governor, says:
'Ultimately, this is about the greed of men for making money. It comes down
to that.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Pillar of Raj shaken by vanishing
money
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered Bank has just completed a magnificent restoration of its
neo-Gothic banking hall in the heart of Bombay. The white marble gleams, and
the crystal chandeliers sparkle.
But staff have little time to admire their surroundings as they grapple with
the bank's biggest financial upset in its 130 years in India. It claims it
was defrauded of Rs8.9bn (Pounds 182m), and though it is trying to recover
the money, it has provided Pounds 100m for possible losses.
Thirteen people have left the bank in India, seven of them dismissed. The
bank has accused two of fraud. Mr Parvesh Nat, chief executive for India, is
resigning to take moral responsibility. Internal investigations are
continuing, and further departures cannot be ruled out.
Dislocations in the money markets forced Standard Chartered's London
headquarters to pump Dollars 800m (Pounds 450m) into its Indian branches. It
says high interest rates and adverse conditions arising from the scandal
cost its Indian business Pounds 18m in the first half of 1992.
The third-largest foreign bank, and once a pillar of the British Raj,
Standard Chartered has an impressive roster of clients, including many of
India's largest industrial houses. Only a handful of its 3,000 staff  - at
24 branches in nine cities - are expatriates.
But in India as elsewhere, the end of empire deprived Standard Chartered of
some of its sense of purpose. Mr Rodney Galpin, the senior Bank of England
official brought in as chairman in 1988, sought to reverse the trend with
'Operation Breakout', an effort to introduce a more aggressive approach to
business.
The bank sought to expand its Bombay merchant banking business under the
direction from London of Mr Ranjit Mathrani, who joined in 1988. He ordered
the Bombay bankers to concentrate more on profits. Business in new share
issues and corporate advice grew rapidly. Profits from merchant banking
trebled in the three years to the end of 1991 to about Rs1bn.
But the results came at a price. Eighteen people left the merchant banking
operations in 1988-90, including the local chief executive and his deputy.
Some employees disliked Mr Mathrani's flying visits from London and what
they saw as his high-handedness. Others believed the single-minded pursuit
of profit led them to take risks which should be avoided.
Evidence of the competitive pressure to sail close to the wind came in a
budget plan for 1990, dated October 1989, which said weaknesses of the
merchant banking division included regulatory constraints 'which other banks
ignore and circumvent'.
The document, which Mr Mathrani says was written by executives in India,
said: 'Opportunities are considerable provided we are focused, have the
desire to circumvent constraints, and (are) prepared to deploy capital
selectively.' He says this was 'not a recommendation, but an observation'.
The strains created by the drive for profit came into the open when Mr
Prakash Yardi, then a middle-level risk-control manager, filed a report in
September 1990 alleging breaches of official and internal guidelines. A bank
inspection team confirmed some of his findings, and procedures were
tightened to stop what the bank calls 'weaknesses in the management of the
portfolio'.
Some Standard Chartered managers had started to invest clients' funds in
unsecured commercial loans, without obtaining internal credit approvals.
Taking a credit risk in this way was against the bank's internal guidelines.
Paying an investor a return above officially-set deposit rates would
infringe central bank regulations unless there were clear instructions that
the bank should invest the money on the investor's behalf.
Legal advice was obtained that management of corporate cash was within the
law, and the business was allowed to continue. Mr Mathrani, who in early
1990 was appointed managing director of Chartered WestLB, a merchant banking
joint venture formed by Standard Chartered and Westdeutsche Landesbank, for
a time assisted in a transitional role the London executives to whom control
had passed. He says: 'Mr Yardi was right in some areas but not necessarily
to the level of seriousness that he implied.' He says the total amount of
questionable transactions was Rs500m. 'The idea that we set about the
process of a mad rush to profitability by breaking the guidelines is
absurd.'
Meanwhile, recruits hired to generate business were prospering. Among them
was Mr R. Kannan, who was hired from Canfina, the fast-growing investment
banking arm of Canara Bank, a small but aggressive Indian bank.
Mr Kannan, now 42, was one of the most active bankers in Bombay. He was put
in charge of security markets investment, reporting to Mr Nat. His
operations generated bumper profits, boosted by the rapid growth in
securities dealing and the sharp rise in the stock market.
In October 1991, the merchant banking operations passed a routine but
rigorous internal audit with flying colours. Everything seemed fine as late
as mid-April 1992, when the bank's chief treasurer for the Middle East and
South Asia division (MESA) visited Bombay. He proclaimed Mr Arvind Mohan
Lal, the chief securities dealer, as 'the best dealer we've got in MESA'.
But scarcely two weeks later, disaster struck when Mr Lal called on Mr Nat
at his luxury Bombay home late one evening and told him of massive losses in
securities trading. Mr Nat could not believe his ears and spent a day
checking the books himself before telephoning head office in London.
Since that day in early May, bank executives have been trying to piece
together what happened. They are still not sure because they cannot trace
all the missing money or all the documentation.
The outline of Standard Chartered's case is expected to be that the
deception started in mid-1991 when a sharp rise in Indian interest rates
caused a fall in bond prices. Mr Lal suffered a loss of perhaps Rs100m-200m:
not enough to hurt the bank, but enough perhaps to damage his career. Mr Lal
tried to conceal the loss with the co-operation of Mr Jaideep Pathak, a
settlements manager in his department. They turned to brokers to help them
hide losses through fictitious deals.
The bank believes the deception then snowballed. Money passed in both
directions, but chiefly into brokers' accounts where it was probably used
for securities investments. The bank charged the two men with fraud and they
were dismissed and arrested.
Standard Chartered alleges in a formal complaint to the police that at least
13 people were involved in fraud - the two employees, four brokers, and
executives at two Indian banks which have since collapsed.
Mr David Gardiner, acting chief executive in succession to Mr Nat, insists
that the bank was the victim of a fraud. But he admits: 'There was clearly a
failure in internal management controls.'
