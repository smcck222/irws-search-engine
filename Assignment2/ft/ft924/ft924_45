FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Economy emerges largely unscathed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 43 per cent drop in the Bombay stock market after the scandal erupted in
April prompted concern that the affair might damage the economy as a whole
and deflect the government from its aim of opening and deregulating the
economy.
But the market's subsequent recovery is a sign that the impact may not be as
bad as expected: Indian investors seem to believe the government will
weather this storm and not be diverted from the road of reform.
Opposition politicians who had hoped to use the affair to embarrass the
government have so far had only modest success. Mr P Chidambaram, the
commerce minister, is the only minister to have resigned over the affair.
The decision of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to establish a joint
parliamentary committee to examine the scandal has created a useful
political lightning rod. It will also win time, since the committee may not
complete its work until next summer.
Nevertheless, the scandal's impact on the economy and on the economic reform
programme is not negligible.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has just returned from a visit to
the UK and the US, where investors told him that the scandal has highlighted
the risks of investing in India, especially in financial instruments.
Indian investors too are worried. Mr N Sankar, president of the Associated
Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, said this week: 'The scam and
the unprecedented closure of stock exchanges for long periods have shaken
the confidence of the investing public.'
Such concerns may prove short-lived if underlying market conditions are
attractive enough to persuade investors to set aside scandal-generated
fears.
However, delays in investment of even a few months could slow growth and
harm public faith in the economic reform programme. Although the government
had approved some Dollars 600m (Pounds 350m) of foreign investment plans by
the end of March, little of this money has in fact been invested.
The scandal has made banks wary of infringing Reserve Bank of India
guidelines. Sticking to the letter of the law has squeezed the supply of
bank credit, which was already tight because of the central bank's efforts
to restrict the money supply to slow inflation.
Mr F A Mehta, a director of Tata Sons, the controlling company of the Tata
industrial group, says: 'The scam has not started the squeeze on credit but
it has aggravated it.' Indian officials say the best way to restore
confidence is to take prompt action to punish offenders and implement
specific reforms. The authorities have shown their resolve by pillorying
suspects such as Mr Harshad Mehta, who spent 111 days being interrogated in
custody before release on bail last week.
The Reserve Bank of India has reminded banks to abide by the rules in the
inter-bank market, including a ban on paying cheques payable to a bank into
the account of a third party, such as a broker - one of the abuses which
surfaced in the scandal.
The central bank has also started a more wide-ranging study of bank
management practices - including standards for book-keeping.
The authorities want to put the scandal behind them. As Mr Salman Khurshid,
junior minister for commerce, puts it: 'The scandal had to happen, and now
that it has, we believe the economy will emerge the stronger for it.' That
may be too much to hope for. But neither, it seems, will the affair leave
the economy significantly weaker.

FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Telecom giants to share network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX OF the world's largest international telecommunications carriers
yesterday announced an agreement to pool parts of their submarine cable
capacity to create a shared global network.
The carriers said the new network, which will be ready by the end of next
year, would provide them with a more flexible and cost-effective way of
routing telecommunications traffic around the world than the current system
of bilateral arrangements.
It would, for example, allow them to respond more quickly to disasters such
as earthquakes, and provide customers with services at shorter notice.
The six carriers are American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, British
Telecommunications (BT), France Telecom, Germany's Deutsche Telekom, Japan's
Kokusai Denshin Denwa, and Australia's OTC.
BT stressed yesterday that the agreement had 'no regulatory implications'
and was therefore not being registered with authorities such as the European
Commission.
It was a co-operation agreement, not a joint venture, it said.
Each carrier would continue to own the capacity it put into the global
network and the financial arrangements under which each carrier gained
access to another operator's infrastructure would be exactly the same as at
the moment, BT said.
Another 14 or 15 carriers could later join the project called the Global
Network Project, which could end up 'spanning the whole world', BT said.

FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: China gets Rothmans habit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JINAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese are the world's heaviest smokers. There are 300m of them, the
great majority men, though more women are taking up the habit. They smoke
1,600bn cigarettes a year, 30 per cent of total world consumption.
It is an enviable domestic market for international tobacco companies hit by
declining sales in countries with more active anti-smoking campaigns than
China, but not an easy one to crack.
It has taken the Rothmans company eight years to establish a small joint
venture cigarette factory in Jinan, Shandong province, officially opened on
Tuesday by former British prime minister, Sir Edward Heath. Shandong is one
of China's biggest tobacco growing provinces.
The Rothmans venture, in partnership with the Shandong Tobacco Corporation,
provincial arm of the national monopoly, is only the second tobacco joint
venture in China and the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration has decreed
it will be the last. The first was set up by Winston manufacturers RJ
Reynolds in Xiamen, a special economic zone in Fujian province across the
strait from Taiwan.
Rothmans was given the go-ahead only because it spent years helping Shandong
tobacco growers improve the quality of their leaf, said Lord Swaythling, the
chairman of Rothmans International.
He dismissed criticism that it was bad for the company to be seen selling
cigarettes to new markets as sales declined in the health-conscious west.
'We're not encouraging Chinese to smoke. They have been the world's biggest
consumers of cigarettes for 40 years. They all smoke like chimneys here
anyway, we just want them to smoke our brands.'
The two brands to be produced in Jinan, are Rothmans international brand and
a local brand, Horseman, retailing at half the price, 3 yuan (43p).
Both brands' packs will carry a health warning, 'Cigarette smoking is
dangerous to your health'.
The Chinese are conscious of a health risk in smoking, but with 20 per cent
of state revenues deriving from taxes on tobacco - the single largest source
of revenue in the country - the authorities tread warily in mounting
anti-smoking campaigns.
The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration has set a target of reaching 30bn
yuan in profits and taxes.
Smoking restrictions are not the rarity they once were. Hotel restaurants
have no-smoking areas and smoking is banned on domestic flights and in
airports.
The joint venture Jinan factory is under-capitalised and very small, with a
capacity of only 40m cigarettes a year. To be viable it should be six times
as large, but Rothmans hopes 'phase two' will begin in two or three years -
if China allows - bringing production levels to 2.5bn.

FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Gatt faces crisis over oilseeds row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE multilateral trading system is facing a damaging crisis of confidence
following yesterday's refusal by the European Community to accept binding
arbitration in its oilseeds row with the US.
The governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt)
has been forced to admit impotence in devising a way of settling the
five-year dispute over EC oilseed subsidies, which have been condemned twice
by a Gatt panel. The EC's proposal for a Gatt working party, whose
recommendations would not be binding, was rejected by the US on Wednesday as
a 'non-solution'.
The failure of Gatt procedures to implement the panel's findings on oilseeds
has seriously dented their credibility. The US is backed by many other Gatt
members in seeing the EC's legalistic arguments against arbitration as a
device to avoid compliance with the panel's rulings.
Yesterday's events have also soured the atmosphere for planned high-level
talks on October 10 and 11 designed to break the impasse in the Uruguay
Round of trade negotiations.
The US is poised to impose prohibitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn-worth of EC
imports if the oilseeds dispute is not speedily resolved.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the decision on which goods
would be targeted and when had yet to be taken in Washington.
He told the council that the US 'remains prepared to negotiate with the
European Community, but time is running very, very short'. The EC would have
to come up with 'fresh new proposals'.
'Our patience has worn very, very thin,' he said after the council meeting
ended.
So far the EC has refused to alter its subsidy system, offering instead
other farm trade concessions that the US and other oilseeds exporters say
are unacceptable.
The US wanted a panel to rule on the global sum of trade damages to oilseeds
exporters, which it puts at Dollars 2bn, against the Dollars 400m EC
estimate.
The dilemma for the US is that imposing trade sanctions would certainly
provoke retaliation by the Community, which would hurt US industry. It would
also not remedy the trade losses suffered by American soyabean farmers. And
it could sink renewed attempts to complete the global trade talks, which
both sides hope could lead to a parallel oilseeds settlement.
'Ultimately, retaliation doesn't help anyone,' Mr Yerxa said yesterday. 'You
have to be hopeful that we can find a solution.'

CHINA is set to retain its low-tariff most favoured nation (MFN) status in
trade with the US, following a vote in the Senate yesterday which sustained
by a 59-40 vote a presidential veto of legislation attaching conditions to
its status.
This follows a 345-74 vote in the House on Wednesday in favour of placing
conditions on China's status. A two-thirds majority is needed in both houses
for this to stand.
The attempt to use trade as leverage with China to improve its human rights
policies has picked up support in both houses since the Tiananmen Square
pro-democracy protests were crushed. But the White House argues the US has
more influence over China if it keeps close trade ties.

CHINA is set to retain the advantages it has in trade with the US under its
most favoured nation (MFN) status following a vote in the Senate yesterday
which sustained by a 59-40 vote a presidential veto of legislation attaching
conditions to its low-tariff status.
This follows a 345-74 vote in the House on Wednesday in favour of placing
conditions on China's status. A two-thirds majority is needed in both houses
for the override to stand.
MFN status gives China the lowest possible tariffs, with the exception of
those granted under free trade agreements.
The attempt to use trade as leverage with China to improve its human rights
policies has picked up support in both houses since the Tiananmen Square
pro-democracy protests were crushed. But the White House argues the US has
more influence over China if it keeps close trade ties.
Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader, yesterday took the
administration's case to the senate floor. 'We've had this debate again and
again,' he said. 'Denying or conditioning MFN will not push the reform
process forward in China one millimetre.'
The issue has come up in the presidential election, with Democrats accusing
President Bush of being 'soft' on China.
In a separate action, US and Chinese negotiators next week will try to reach
a settlement on a US complaint that it is denied market access in China. At
stake is up to Dollars 3.9bn in threatened US sanctions and
counter-retaliation by Beijing.

FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: NCM acquires Swedish export insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NCM, the Dutch export credit group that last year acquired the short-term
trade finance business of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department
(ECGD), is to take control of short-term export insurance in Sweden
following the collapse of Svenska Kredit, the country's only private export
credit insurer.
The agreement to bail out Svenska Kredit provides urgently needed relief to
Swedish exporters, who were threatened with the prospect of being unable to
obtain export insurance cover by the end of October.
Svenska Kredit is understood to have collapsed largely because of defaulting
property loans.
Its export credit business, which accounted for the lion's share of its
SKr338m (Pounds 41m) premium income in 1991, is reportedly sound.
NCM will provide cover through a new company, called NCM Kreditforsakring.
It will not provide political risk cover, nor cover for contracts of more
than three years duration.
These will be referred to the country's government-controlled export credit
agency, Exportkreditnannden (EKN).
In the UK, the ECGD has agreed to provide loans totalling Dollars 45m to
help finance Airbuses to Ivory Coast, Tunisia and Greece.
This represents Britain's 20 per cent share of the finance element of the
deals, involving two Airbus A310-300s to Air Afrique, an A320 for Tunisair,
and an A310-600 for Olympic Airways.
ANZ Bank has been awarded the mandate to arrange the USDollars 100m
financing for a new international airport in the Portuguese colony of Macao.
Finance will involve credits supported by the ECGD in the UK, Hermes in
Germany, Eximbank in the US, EFIC in Australia and COSEC, Portugal's export
credit insurer.
The contract for the airport terminal has been awarded to the German-owned
Siemens, and Soares de Costa of Portugal.

FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Brazil on schedule with tariff reductions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S latest round of import tariff reductions took place on schedule
yesterday, despite the paralysis of the government during the transition of
power from President Fernando Collor, who faces impeachment proceedings on
corruption charges, to Vice-President Itamar Franco.
Average tariffs were reduced from 21.2 per cent to 17.1 per cent. No
government action was necessary to implement the changes, made under a
gradual scheme begun in 1990.
The maximum tariff, for toys, fell from 65 per cent to 55 per cent. Vehicle
imports will be subject to duties of 40 per cent, down from 50 per cent.
Tariffs for petrochemical products dropped to 15 per cent from 20 per cent.
New rounds of reductions are scheduled for January and July 1993. By the
later date, average tariffs are to reach 14.2 per cent.
However, opinions were divided about whether the opening of the economy
would be continued under Mr Franco, or rolled back. Important national
business interests, led by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI), are
already lobbying him to slow the pace of import liberalisation. Similar
pleas to Economy Minister Marclio Marques Moreira, soon to leave the
government, fell on deaf ears.
'It is business people, not the left, who are going to put an end to the
opening,' predicted Mr Jose Dirceu, federal deputy from the leftist Workers
party (PT).
'Some sectors are still opposed to the plan, opposed to modernisation,'
noted Mr Gilberto Galan, director of external relations for Kodak
Brasileira. 'But I believe that Itamar won't change the schedule.'
'I am quite confident that it will continue, though maybe not at the same
speed,' said Mr Lawrence Pih, head of Moinho Pacifico, a flour milling
company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST results in Angola's elections last night showed a narrow lead for
President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of the ruling MPLA over his main rival Mr
Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel Unita movement.
But thousands of results from many rural areas which Unita claim as its
strongholds still had not been declared and Unita issued its own selective
results from these areas showing a 2:1 lead for Mr Savimbi.
The closeness of initial results raised the possibility of a second round of
presidential elections if no candidate gets more than 50 per cent of the
vote.
The National Electoral Commission announced official results from 753 of the
5,800 polling stations, which showed Mr Dos Santos leading by 318,082 votes
to Mr Savimbi's 166,058 after about 15 per cent of the votes had been
officially counted.
Mr Dos Santos was making a particularly strong showing in Luanda, Kwanza
Sul, Huila and Bengo provinces. In the hotly contested central regions of
Benguela, Bie and Huambo - which were always expected to be the critical
battleground - Unita appeared to be ahead on the initial results declared.
Mr Onofre Dos Santos, electoral commission chairman, said results from
polling stations were arriving in Luanda at about 200-300 an hour and a
definitive picture would not be clear till morning.
Independent pollsters said their preliminary results showed Mr Dos Santos
leading Mr Savimbi by 50 per cent to 38 per cent with other parties
capturing about 11 per cent of the vote.
The United Nations, European Community and other international observers
yesterday congratulated the Angolan people for the peaceful two-day ballot,
which exceeded all expectations.
Miss Margaret Anstee, special representative of the UN secretary general,
said the elections were generally peaceful and orderly, although the UN
would wait a few days before making a final verification as to the freedom
and fairness of the polls.
The EC praised the conduct of the election and promised to send aid to the
country.
International monitors said they were confident that after promises given by
the two leaders, both sides would respect the result of the elections.

The centre, funded by the shipping industry, will broadcast warning messages

enforcement agencies and provide support services after incidents of piracy.
The bureau said there had been about 200 attacks by pirates last year. As
well as the danger to ships' crews, piracy could cause environmental
disasters if tanker crews were tied up and unable to steer their vessels.

Japanese vehicle sales were 4.4 per cent lower in September than a year ago
as consumer demand continued to wane, writes Steven Butler in Tokyo.
The Japanese Automobile Dealers Association said yesterday that 466,252
vehicles were registered in September. The only rise in sales recorded was
for small trucks.
A 11.2 per cent drop in sales of cars of more than 2 litres reflected the
impact of the recession on spending on luxury items.
Sales of Toyota cars were virtually unchanged from last year, while Nissan
sales were down 19.3 per cent. Mitsubishi sold 8.9 per cent more cars.

TAJIKISTAN'S government was split yesterday over the presence of Russian
troops sent to put down fighting in the central Asian republic, Reuter
reports from Dushanbe.
Mr Abdulmalik Abdullodzhanov, the acting prime minister who heads a loose
coalition of Moslems and parliamentary democrats, said the Russians should
stay until the conflict was over.
'The Russian troop reinforcements came to our republic not to shoot. We
invited them to establish control over the fighting,' he said.
But Mr Davlat Usmon, deputy prime minister and a prominent member of the
Islamic Revival Party (IRP), said he was against the deployment of Russian
troops in the former Soviet republic. He said the Russian army in Tajikistan
had been the main source of supply of weapons to the warring sides.
The coalition has ruled the backward, clan-dominated republic of 5m people
since the ex-communist President Rakhmon Nabiyev was forced from office last
month.
Russia sent reinforcements this week, saying they were needed to protect the
families of the troops already there from the rival Tajik factions.

JAPAN'S disgraced political godfather, Mr Shin Kanemaru, emerged from his
home yesterday after 35 days in seclusion, vowing never to break the law
again, and presuming that his period of isolation will allow him to return
as the powerbroker of Japanese politics.
Mr Kanemaru, 78, who presides over the largest faction in the ruling Liberal
Democratic party, made clear that the rites of purification are officially
over, and that his violation of the Political Funds Control Law should be
forgotten.
Having illegally received Y500m (Pounds 2.4m) from a scandal-tainted parcel
delivery company, the 'godfather', as he is known, was summarily fined only
Y200,000 (Pounds 966) this week and had the luxury of drafting his
confession in his Tokyo home.
By remaining at home, and out of sight for a month, Mr Kanemaru has
attempted to outwit his opponents by outwaiting them. While petitions
circulated calling for his resignation, the godfather stayed behind closed
doors, portraying himself both as a victim of media harassment and as a
repentant one-time offender.
It is customary for the accused in Japan, particularly politicians, to seek
refuge in isolation, most often a 'sudden illness' requiring
hospitalisation. A Japanese tabloid yesterday favourably compared Mr
Kanemaru's strategy to that of the 'besieged samurai', waiting patiently for
the enemy to exhaust its energy.
But the public outcry over his lenient treatment has yet to disappear.
A manager at a Japanese cosmetics company said he was 'speechless' at the
antics of Mr Kanemaru, and a 26-year-old teacher said that she and her
parents had spent the last month 'amazed by the arrogance' of the godfather.
Some were struck by the irony that he chose 'Respect the Law Day' to make
his reappearance, which followed pleas from his fellow faction members that
they wanted him to remain at the helm, if only to prevent the faction from
collapsing under the combined weight of the potential successors' ambitions.
Mr Kanemaru announced a month ago that he received Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa
Kyubin, and said then he would resign as head of the faction and
vice-president of the LDP. But during his period of contemplation at home,
made bearable by his love of board games and telephone politicking, he
decided to hold on to retake the factional post.
'I am sorry for having caused trouble to everyone, including my neighbours,'
Mr Kanemaru said. His neighbours have suffered greatly over the past month,
as television vans, camera operators, police and protesters have crammed the
streets surrounding his home.
Mr Kanemaru said: 'I swear I will never repeat anything like this in my
life,' suggesting that he intends to remain politically active.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Kuwaiti election will please allies more than emir:
Restoration of parliament will expose the government to fierce criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY MONDAY night, Kuwait's 81,400 voters will have elected a new National
Assembly, at once reviving the Gulf's oldest parliament and, in western
eyes, tying an appealing democratic rosette on the victory of Desert Storm.
For the US and other governments which helped evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait
last year, the election result will be seen as the happy end to a job well
done: Kuwait has been freed, its rulers restored and the state set fair on a
democratic path which, they hope, other Gulf states will follow.
Within Kuwait, however, the election of a new parliament will represent the
return to business rudely interrupted not so much by the Gulf war as by the
decision of Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, the emir, to suspend the previous
assembly in 1986 for what he considered its obstructive and divisive
opposition to the government.
It will mark a return, in fact, to a political tradition which Kuwait has
enjoyed, with interruptions, since the late Sheikh Abdullah al-Sabah signed
the country's founding 1962 constitution empowering a National Assembly with
rights unknown in other Gulf emirates, sheikhdoms, sultanates or kingdoms to
initiate and veto laws and to question and even remove ministers.
By western standards, Kuwait's democracy pales before the real thing. Just
13 per cent of the 606,000 Kuwaiti citizens are allowed to vote under a
franchise extended only to men over 21 who can trace their lineage back to
the 1920s (though this small proportion is due in part to the fact that 60
per cent of Kuwaitis are under 21). Naturalised Kuwaitis and, in particular,
women, have argued bitterly for the vote during the campaign - a wish which
there appears a strong national consensus eventually to grant.
Moreover, Kuwait's democratic style has a peculiarly cosy and social feel.
Most campaigning takes place by night at the often lavish campaign tents of
the 278 candidates vying for the assembly's 50 seats.
Thousands of voters gather there to hear candidates or huddle in discussion
served, at the most opulent tents, by waiters bearing soft drinks or with
buffets which would make the most profligate Wimbledon corporate host blush
with humility and the most purist democrat simply blush.
But as convivial and unrepresentative as the campaign may appear, it has
been fought in considerable earnest. The election of a majority, or even a
sizeable minority, of government opponents could offer the ruling al-Sabah
family a serious and discomfiting challenge, if not quite a true contest for
power.
For the most part, Kuwait's informal opposition groups - political parties
are not permitted - represent factions which pre-date the Gulf crisis,
holding familiar positions which have been sharpened rather than changed by
the effects of Kuwait's occupation.
Broadly, the organised opposition divides into the secular, led by the
Kuwait Democratic Forum (KDF), and the religious, represented by the Sunni
groupings of the moderate Islamic Constitutional Movement (ICM), the more
radical Safanayeen and a smaller, coalition of candidates loosely
representing Kuwait's 35 to 40 per cent Shia population.
But none of these groups is fielding more than a handful of candidates each
 -the KDF is fielding nine, for instance, and the Safanayeen seven. Despite
long-standing attempts since liberation to co-operate more closely,
candidates from these groups are in many constituencies running against each
other. These organised groups are considered unlikely, therefore, to win
more than their traditional small share of seats.
The opposition's success is also likely to be limited by the general
conservatism of Kuwaiti voters, who in many constituencies have previously
tended to vote more along tribal than ideological or religious lines. The
government has been assiduous in seeking to reinforce such conservatism.
Since Kuwait's liberation, the government has written off all outstanding
consumer loans, raised government salaries by 25 per cent (92 per cent of
Kuwaitis are public employees), and offered KD1,000 (Pounds 2,000)grants to
Kuwaitis who endured the occupation. Mr Jassem al-Saddoun, a prominent local
economist, reckons the government has spent KD3.8bn on directly political
public expenditure.
Most local observers therefore conclude that voters will return only a
minority of outright opposition candidates. 'I think about 30 per cent will
be for the government, and maybe 30 per cent opposition,' says Mr Abdulla
Nibari of the KDF. The remainder, he suggests, will be broadly independent.
A similar mix in the previous parliament did not prevent it from
sufficiently upsetting the government, largely by seeking to delve deeply
into the financial affairs of certain senior ministers, for the emir to
suspend the assembly in 1986. 'The parliament has real powers in Kuwait, but
only if the opposition can find the right issue around which to unite,' says
one western diplomat. 'A sufficiently vocal minority on the right issue can
swing the whole parliament behind it.'
A build-up of frustration since 1986, combined with widespread disaffection
with the government's competence before, during and since the Gulf war may
well provide such issues early in the parliament. Many candidates, and not
only those of the organised opposition, believe the government has for too
long been held unaccountable for its policies.
'We are going to hold the government accountable for everything it has done
since 1986,' says Mr Jassem Qabazard, an independent running in the central
Rumaithia constituency. 'We are going to ask, 'What have you been doing all
this time?',' he says, adding, with emphasis: 'What have you been doing with
our money?'
Two specific issues could bring such discontent into an early confrontation
between the parliament and the government. One, which has been a hot topic
in Kuwait's diwaniyahs (informal social gatherings) for months, is the
handling of Kuwait's overseas investments.
Kuwaitis have read with dismay on the front pages of local papers about
investments by the London-based Kuwait Investment Office in lossmaking
Spanish industry. 'We strongly feel that what happened in Spain is the
responsibility of leading people in Kuwait - even some of the ministers,'
says Mr Ali al-Ghanem, another independent candidate.
A second issue is the government's scheme to recover billions of dollars of
debt left over from the 1982 collapse of the Souq al-Manakh informal stock
market crisis. Although the government recently took over the KD5.8bn of
residual debt lying on the books of Kuwait's banks, it has yetto propose a
convincing scheme to recover money still owing.
It was, after all, the attempts by the previous parliament to uncover who
owes money and how much which prompted its suspension. Many candidates
believe such an option would not be open to the emir with the next
parliament - not least with US eyes watching closely. 'People's attitudes in
Kuwait and outside pressure will be a hindrance in this case,' says Mr
Nibari. Kuwait's next National Assembly could then reopen at much the same
temperature as that in which the last was closed.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Italy seeks EC loan to boost lira: Rome begins talks with
partners on L10,000bn stand-by loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>

   ROME, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday said it had begun discussions with its EC
partners on a special stand-by loan to boost the lira and sustain confidence
in plans for an early return to the European Monetary System.
According to unofficial estimates last night, the loan could be the
equivalent of L10,000bn (Pounds 4.5bn).
The surprise move was announced along with Italy's 1993 budget which was
approved yeterday by the cabinet and promises to reform the country's
deteriorating public finances.
Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, said the aim of the loan was partly
political. At one level, he said Italy wished to demonstrate its continued
commitment to the EMS, but at the same time the loan appears designed to
provide a rigid external framework for Italy's economic performance. It
would make it more difficult for parliament to water down the budget.
Officials declined to reveal the amount of the loan but said it was
different from the UK's move earlier this month to go to the markets for an
Ecu loan to help protect sterling. It is expected to take up to four or five
weeks to negotiate and would not be drawn down until after the 1993 budget
was approved.
There was speculation yesterday that the stand-by facility might not be
fully used if granted, providing the currency markets stabilised and
interest rates began to fall. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said
the facility would be a 'super-certification' by Italy's EC partners of the
country's credibility. The lira was still under pressure yesterday, hovering
around L880 to the D-Mark.
Officials in Brussels predicted a sympathetic response to the Italian loan
request. Mr Amato is viewed as the best hope for tackling the country's
budgetary crisis and restoring international confidence in the economy, but
he needs outside help, an EC official said.
An EC loan would support his efforts to win parliamentary approval for his
economic package, rather than a potentially contentious loan from the
International Monetary Fund. 'We would be keeping the problem within the
family,' the official said.
Brussels expects Mr Amato to seek financial aid under Rule 1969 adopted in
June 1988 allowing the EC to help countries which experience balance of
payments problems or adverse capital movements.
Some Ecu16bn (Pounds 12.59bn) has been set aside for support. Greece is the
only EC member to have applied, securing a Ecu2.2bn stabilisation loan in
February 1991, to prepare the country to join the next phase of monetary
union.
Under the deal, the Community goes to the capital markets to raise the money
on the best possible terms, using its own guarantees.
A maximum of Ecu14bn can be raised this way, with Ecu2bn or more coming as
medium term credits from member states.
Before 1988, Ireland, France and Italy all received European Community funds
to help them tackle balance of payments difficulties.
Italy's problems come amid the debate within the EC about the pros and cons
of a 'two-speed Europe.' In this sense, Brussels' support is viewed as an
important sign that all countries can at least aspire to monetary union, if
they take the necessary painful austerity measures.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Turkey gives military carte blanche against Kurds: John
Murray Brown explains the background to this week's battle against the Kurds
which may have claimed 200 lives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC reform in Turkey was always going to be difficult to administer
while the Kurdish rebels pursued their campaign for a separate state. But
after this week's fighting, Turkey's fragile coalition appears to have
abandoned any hope of a political solution to the eight-year-old Kurdish
conflict.
Turkey's Kurdish civil war reached a new level of violence this week, with
government claims that more than 150 guerrillas of the Kurdish Workers Party
(PKK) were killed in a clash with security forces at Semdinli near the
border with Iraq. The deaths of government troops, guards and civilians
brought the toll to over 200.
Last week's resounding vote of confidence for the interior minister's
handling of the crisis was probably decisive in the government's decision to
mount what appears to be one of the largest military operations against the
PKK. But with more than 1,700 people killed this year, a government response
has been on the cards for some months.
News of the military operation, coupled with the increasingly hawkish
statements of Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, have been almost
universally welcomed at home. Nonetheless, the likely international
criticism of the action will not make things easier for Turkey's allies.
The UK, as current president of the European Community, has called for an
'enhanced relationship' between Brussels and Ankara. Mr Douglas Hurd, the
British foreign secretary, is scheduled to meet his Turkish counterpart, Mr
Hikmet Cetin, in London during Mr Cetin's visit to London which starts on
October 12. In a recent interview, Mr Hurd made clear that any improvement
in ties would in part depend on the progress of reforms.
All moves on reform for the Kurdish population have been frozen. After
months of deliberation, the government is set upon excluding Kurdish areas
from coming under the umbrella of proposed human rights legislation which
goes before parliament later this month.
The reforms envisage changes in the criminal procedure code in a bid to
stamp out the widely condemned incidence of torture. The proposals are seen
as a test of Turkey's commitment to western values.
However, over the weekend, Mr Demirel warned that the 'security forces will
be left with no authority if the same clauses are implemented in a region
where the fight against terrorism is going on.'
Despite their long advocacy of rights for the Kurds, Mr Demirel's social
democrat partners are in no mood to question this analysis, preoccupied as
they are with internal squabbles with the newly revived People's Republican
party.
Mr Demirel is even said to be considering legal action against Kurdish
deputies sympathetic to the PKK. Such a move would be roundly condemned
internationally, but would no doubt win broad support among Turks.
Steps are underway to strip members of the Kurdish- backed People's Labour
party (HEP) of their parliamentary immunity. The senior state prosecutor is
bidding to bring them before the court on charges which carry the death
penalty.
All these measures will bolster the standing of Mr Demirel's True Path party
in the forthcoming local elections scheduled for November 1.
However, in municipalities contested in the south east, there is every
prospect that the HEP will strengthen their position in the polls, a result
which would further exacerbate the already tense relations between security
forces and local officials.
Mr Demirel's decision to give the military carte blanche in the fight
against the PKK is a measure of how far the conflict has worsened.
Approval has been given for the purchase of Black Hawk helicopters to
improve the army's ability to respond to the increasing number of attacks on
army frontier posts in the mountains along the borders with Iraq and Iran.
Ever larger numbers of troops have also been deployed to the region.
The danger however is that the increased hostilities could play into the
rebels' hands.
The often brutal counter insurgency tactics of the security forces has been
a major factor in polarising opinion in a Kurdish community where the
extremism of the PKK and its Marxist leader Apo Abdullah Ocalan should offer
few natural attractions.

FT  02 OCT 92 / 10,000 children dead or missing in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 10,000 children have been killed or have vanished in the six-month
war in Bosnia, according to figures published yesterday by Bosnian
officials.
Meanwhile, a large convoy of Moslems prisoners released from detention camps
moved out of Serb-held northern Bosnia yesterday. It was the first
large-scale evacuation of camp inmates organised by the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
Outlining the fate of Bosnian children, Mr Arif Smajkic, director of the
Bosnian crisis centre in Sarajevo, said 1,447 children were known to have
been killed and about 8,500 were missing.
He told journalists 14,364 people had died and 57,000 had been reported
missing since April.
But even these figures are believed to be underestimates, because they were
compiled mainly in Moslem and Croat-held areas and do not reflect Serb
casualties in Serb-held territories.
In Sarajevo alone, a city under siege for five months, 730 children had
disappeared without trace, the centre said.
Reflecting the savagery of the fighting, 47,284 people had been seriously
wounded, including 12,080 children, and 78,500 slightly injured, 11,775 of
them children. Some 80 per cent of all victims were civilians, many of them
refugees.
The 1,500 prisoners released yesterday from northern Bosnia moved out in a
convoy of buses.
Formerly held at the Serb-run Trnopolje camp, they were to go to a transmit
camp arranged by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the Croatian town
of Karlovac.
The unilateral prisoner release is seen as a public relations effort by Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnian Serb forces, who control some
two-thirds of Bosnian territory.
Meanwhile Lady Chalker, the UK minister for overseas development, yesterday
was due to deliver a consignment of medical aid worth Pounds 280,000 during
a visit to Split, the Croatian port, and Mostar, the heavily damaged city in
western Bosnia-Hercegovina, according to HINA, the Croatian news agency.
In Washington, the US announced that it was resuming relief flights to
Sarajevo, after they were halted nearly a month ago when an Italian aircraft
was shot down by a missile.
The Pentagon said it would send out orders today, so that flights could
resume tomorrow, weather permitting.
Sarajevo needs 200 tons of food and other aid daily, but was getting less
than a quarter of that by road while the airlift was suspended.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Rouble's sharp fall continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian rouble dropped sharply again yesterday in interbank trading in
Moscow, from the previous record low of 254 to the new low of 309 to the
dollar.
The latest sharp fall means a drop in the rate for September of nearly
Rbs100 - from Rbs210.5 on September 1 to Rbs309 yesterday.
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Russian Central Bank chairman, told the Interfax
news agency that the issue of again fixing the rate of the rouble against
hard currencies would be 'most actively discussed' with the government in
the next month. He blamed expectations of a further rise in inflation
following higher fuel and energy prices for the continuing fall in the
rouble, and said the bank attempted only limited intervention.
The rouble fell yesterday as citizens were for the first time able to
collect vouchers with a face value of Rbs10,000 which will entitle them to
buy shares in companies soon to be offered for auction. The evidence from
Moscow was of a sluggish, almost reluctant response, with a fraction of
those planned for collecting their vouchers.
Perhaps symbolically, the first commercial bankruptcy in the former Soviet
Union was reported yesterday, in the county of Harju in Estonia. The
company, Norten, was declared bankrupt by the regional court and its assets
seized.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Bulgarian reforms win OECD praise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA has made considerable progress towards market-oriented reforms but
is still far from reaching sustainable macro-economic stability, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says in its
first report on the highly indebted former communist state.
Since embarking on market reforms in February 1991, goods have become more
widely available at higher prices, freedom of choice and the scope for
entrepreneurial activity have increased dramatically, inflation has been
contained and export growth to the OECD has been high.
But these achievements remain fragile, the report warns.
'Sustainable macro-economic stability remains hostage both to progress with
structural reforms and to a solution of the external debt problem'.
Bulgaria declared a unilateral moratorium on its Dollars 9.2bn foreign debt
in June 1990.
The borrowings were partly used to import components from the west for
incorporation into exports to soft-currency Comecon or third world markets.
The country's high exposure to such trade made it particularly vulnerable to
the collapse of Comecon, the Soviet bloc trading group.
Over the medium term, the reports says, Bulgaria will attract official
capital inflows, foreign investment and trade credit only if a satisfactory
solution is found to the external debt problem.
This would be one based on 'a voluntary arrangement involving compromises on
both creditor and debtor sides'.

FT  02 OCT 92 / France offers talks with UK on nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is ready to start talks with Britain on 'a European deterrence
doctrine' covering the future wider role of nuclear weapons held by the two
states, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, said yesterday.
This is the most explicit statement of the new shift in French strategy,
first hinted at by President Francois Mitterrand in January and repeated
this week by Mr Pierre Joxe, the defence minister.
Paris appears to have abandoned the Gaullist-era rationale that French
atomic arms were for the defence of France alone. It has conceded its
European neighbours might have a legitimate interest in how France develops
its nuclear weapons strategy, and even appears to be quietly vaunting an
eventual nuclear dimension to a common European defence policy, as
foreshadowed in the Maastricht treaty.
Winding up a three-day European defence seminar, Mr Beregovoy said
discussions between France and the UK would be 'a useful first step'. But he
cautioned that development of anything as sensitive as a new nuclear
doctrine would take even longer than those under way on the planned
'Euro-corps' of French and German troops.
The French government does not appear to have in mind any joint control,
operation or targeting of French and UK nuclear weaponry. But one aim might
be the creation of a nuclear consultative group in the Western European
Union (WEU) to discuss the general role of European-held nuclear weapons,
their relationship to conventional defence and their use in a crisis.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, told the same Paris seminar on
Wednesday that he welcomed the idea of discussions on a European nuclear
doctrine.
But he did not see as much scope for a European 'division of labour' with
the US on nuclear policy as in conventional defence. It was not realistic to
think that 'there could be a major conflict in Europe in which the question
of nuclear use arose which did not involve the vital interests of all the
allies, including the US', he cautioned.
However, he believed there should be 'more explicit emphasis on the
progressive merging of interests between the Western European nuclear powers
and their non-nuclear partners and allies'.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Italians get toughest budget since 1950's: Prime minister
Giuliano Amato is weary but confident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a gruelling all-night cabinet session approving Italy's 1993 budget,
Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, announced with weary confidence:
'We have done what is necessary to return to the tracks from which we have
been derailed.' His message was brief but clear. It is now up to parliament
to approve as soon as possible the toughest budget Italy has faced since the
'economic miracle' began in the fifties.
In theory parliament has till the end of the year to amend or endorse the
budget. But with the lira under continued pressure floating outside the
European Monetary System early approval of the budget will provide a key
signal from Italy's fractured political parties that the country is willing
to make a serious effort to tackle its huge public sector deficit. If
unchecked the deficit could reach over 14 per cent of GDP within a year.
Approval of the budget also conditions the timing of Italy's re-entry into
the EMS which Prof Amato said yesterday he would like to see as soon as
possible. The prime minister refrained from imposing a timetable on
parliament yesterday; nor did he repeat his threat to resign if the budget
is watered down. However, he has made this abundantly clear and one reason
behind theseven hour cabinet session was an attempt to ensure the full
loyalty of all the four parties in the government coalition.
At several stages reports leaked out of threatened ministerial resignations
but the cabinet has remained intact. The government appears confident, of
being able to push the budget through and ride out a continuing wave of
union protest. Today all public employers will observe a four-hour stoppage
to protest cuts in pensions and the health service.
The move to seek a special balance of payment loan from the EC, announced
with the budget, could also prove a clever tactical move. Access to the loan
is intended to provide a framework of external discipline, in the form of EC
monitoring of the budget, which the government can invoke if parliament
threatens to water down the proposed cuts.
Despite strong pressure from several different lobbies, the budget has
differed little from that outlined on September 17. The main aim is to raise
L93,000bn in fresh revenues and spending cuts, so holding the public sector
deficit down to L150,000bn, over 10.5 per cent of GDP.
The proposals are framed against the background of reforms in the four areas
 -pensions, the health service, the civil service and regional
administration and local authorities. The savings will be cumulative over
three to four years and will provide the basis of the government's strategy
to reach a public sector deficit equivalent to 3.5 per cent of GDP by 1996.
Ministers say that although the budget will not reduce the public sector
deficit next year, it will hold it down in constant terms. There will be a
primary surplus (net of interest payments of L200,000bn) of around
L50,000bn. Interest payments themselves will be conditional on interest rate
levels; but the authorities hope these can be reduced once the budget is
approved. Each percentage point drop will save L15,000bn in a full year.
All public sector spending is being frozen at 1992 levels, which on an
inflation projection of 4.5 per cent for 1993, indicates a real decline. All
ministries will be affected and some of the hardest bargaining in recent
days has been over the sizeable health and education cuts.
On the revenue side, much will depend upon whether the 1.5 percent
projection for economic growth materialises.
The budget, if implemented in its present form against a background of high
interest rates, will force the economy into recession, according to several
prominent economists.
The shake-up of the state sector and declining industrial profits also
suggests an increase in unemployment. To this end the government yesterday
set aside L1,800bn over the next three years to aid employment schemes.
The government also decided to introduce by decree with immediate effect a
special tax of 7.5 per 1,000 lire on the net worth of all registered
companies.
This one-off measure which is expected to cost a group like Fiat some
L670bn. It will raise a total of L6,000bn and also affects for the first
time small companies.
As a political measure there is also a tax on luxury goods like aircraft and
expensive cars. In this way the government has done its best to try and
spread the burden of sacrifice evenly.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Czechoslovak federal parliament yesterday rejected a governmental
proposal for a constitutional break-up of the federation into two republics,
dashing political hopes that the divorce between Czechs and Slovaks would be
fast and clean.
The bill, which set out four legal alternatives for dissolving the federal
state, was blocked by opposition parties seeking a referendum on the
decision.
The rejection highlights the lack of political consensus behind the
post-electoral agreements reached by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime
minister, and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart. The leaders had
agreed to dissolve the federal state by January 1, 1993. They said they
would favour a parliamentary declaration ending the federation rather than a
referendum, the outcome of which is far from certain. Recent opinion polls
show both Czechs and Slovaks equally divided on the issue.
But opposition parties, feeling neglected in the negotiating process,
yesterday refused to lend their votes to reach the three-fifths majority
needed to adopt a constitutional law.
The ruling parties and the opposition will now have to work out a difficult
compromise, which could possibly consist of a parliamentary declaration to
be ratified in a referendum.
Difficult negotiations also lie ahead on the division of federal properties.
While Czechs would like to split the assets based on the territory on which
they stand, Slovaks have called for financial settlements in cases, such as
the military infrastructure, where most properties are in the Czech lands.

FT  02 OCT 92 / HK Land acquires 14.99% of Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG LAND, one of the colony's leading property investment and
development companies, yesterday acquired 14.99 per cent of Trafalgar House,
the UK property, engineering and construction group.
It immediately announced it was going to tender for another 15 per cent of
Trafalgar's shares and would seek to place representatives on the board.
Hongkong Land said it wanted to remain a minority shareholder and not offer
to acquire Trafalgar's remaining shares for at least 12 months unless there
were 'material changes of circumstances'. These could include an indication
by Trafalgar's board that it would welcome an offer from Hongkong Land, or a
bid from a third party.
Trafalgar's ordinary shares yesterday rose 29p to 89 1/2 p and its A shares
28 1/2 p to 86p. Hongkong Land paid 85p per ordinary share and 82p per A
share.
Trafalgar's advisers believe Hongkong Land has set a floor of85p for its
ordinary shares which recently fell to 50p.
Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chief executive, said: 'To try and get control
of a company by buying up to a third of its shares at depressed prices is
not the way we do things here.'
Trafalgar said the price paid by Hongkong Land did not reflect the
underlying net worth and prospects of the group and earlier 'strongly
advised' shareholders not to sell. The group described its strategy after a
board meeting with its financial advisers, Kleinwort Benson and Lazard
Brothers, its joint stockbrokers, Cazenove and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
Securities, and its solicitor, Ashurst Morris Crisp.
Some of Trafalgar's biggest shareholders sold shares to Hongkong Land's
broker, Warburg Securities, but said they were unsure whether to take
advantage of the tender offer.
Hongkong Land's decision to take a stake in Trafalgar surprised the group.
Jardine Matheson, which controls a third of Hongkong Land, jointly owns
Gammon, a large Hong Kong contractor, with Trafalgar House.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Major set for battle with rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night set the stage for a bloody confrontation with his
party's Euro-sceptics by pledging to push ahead with ratification of the
Maastricht treaty.
In a determined move to re-establish his political authority without
splitting the Conservative party, Mr Major tempered his challenge to Tory
rebels by re-emphasising that sterling's re-entry to the European exchange
rate mechanism was on indefinite hold.
Senior ministers said it would be more than a year - and possibly as long as
two - before the pound was put back in the ERM. Mr Major is not ruling out
the possibility of tax increases next year if a tighter fiscal policy is
needed to underpin the government's anti-inflation strategy.
His clear response to charges that the government's European policy was
adrift came after a day in which a furious diplomatic row had been sparked
by the FT's publication of the Bundesbank's defence of its record during the
sterling crisis.
The prime minister said he wanted now to 'draw a line' under disputes with
Germany.
He rejected calls from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for the resignation
of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in the wake of the Bundesbank's
insistence it had met its obligations to defend sterling in the ERM.
Earlier the Foreign Office had summoned the German ambassador to receive a
formal protest against the embassy's decision to pass the statement to the
FT.
But after an 'expression of regret' by the Bundesbank over the incident, Mr
Major indicated that his priority was to re-establish good relations with
Bonn. That sentiment was echoed by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister, who last night called for calm in Germany's relations with
Britain.
In visibly combative mood after securing cabinet agreement to reassert the
commitment to keep Britain at the 'heart of Europe', Mr Major said he wanted
a full-scale Commons debate on Maastricht after the Birmingham summit
scheduled for October 14.
Despite claims by the Euro-sceptics that he risks civil war on the Tory
backbenches, the prime minister indicated that the full force of the party
machine would be used to secure a majority for the legislation. He added:
'It is certainly the intention to pass the Maastricht Bill during this
session of parliament.' His high-risk decision to defy the Euro-sceptics -
for which he demand-ed and received the support of the cabinet - is designed
to fill the vacuum in foreign policy left by the ERM debacle. It aims to
rebut charges from friends as well as enemies that Mr Major has failed to
give a clear lead during the ensuing turmoil.
Last night, he left no doubt of his determination to get through the treaty
which he declared last December had represented 'game, set and match' for
Britain. 'I don't think that, upon reflection, the Commons will think it
appropriate for a British prime minister to negotiate a bill, agree a bill
and then abandon it - and I don't propose to do so,' he said.
That comment came after he had told colleagues that unless Britain ratified
Maastricht it would never again be able to secure concessions in
negotiations with its European partners. He told the cabinet that nothing
less than 'the credibility of Britain' was at stake over the treaty.
Mr Major is aware that the move will provoke a series of damaging rows at
next week's Conservative party conference, where the Euro-sceptics are
promising to mobilise grass-roots opposition to Maastricht. But yesterday
Lady Thatcher indicated that she would not use a planned visit to the
Brighton conference to launch an attack on her successor in Downing Street.
The prime minister is optimistic of a deal with other EC leaders at
Birmingham on a declaration committing them to closer definition of the
division of authority between Brussels and national governments.
After an intense round of diplomatic contacts with his European partners
this week, Mr Major believes that a declaration embracing the so-called
subsidiarity principle will be one of several clarifications which will make
Maastricht more palatable both to Tory MPs and to Denmark, which voted
against Maastricht in a referendum, by the time of a second summit in
Edinburgh in December.
If the Birmingham meeting goes according to plan, Mr Major will hold a
debate on the principle of the Maastricht bill soon after the House of
Commons returns on October 19. Pressure will be applied to every Tory MP to
support it.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Rift fears knock 5 pfennigs off sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING dropped nearly five pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as
foreign exchange dealers were thrown into confusion by the new rift between
the UK Treasury and the Bundesbank.
The emergence of a new fault-line in Anglo-German relations pushed the pound
down to DM2.4770 in Asian trading on Wednesday night and the currency
bottomed out at DM2.4680 in Europe yesterday.
The pound later closed in London at DM2.4750, down 4 1/4 pfennigs on the day
and 16 per cent below its former central parity in the exchange rate
mechanism of DM2.95. Against the dollar, it closed down nearly 5 cents at
Dollars 1.7365.
In New York later, where the dollar was generally stronger, the pound
finished at DM4.7300 and Dollars 1.7405.
Dealers believe the immediate outlook for sterling and other European
currencies depends on whether the Bundesbank cuts interest rates at its
council meeting today.
Earlier this week, a member of the central bank's council said there would
be no German rate cut for six months. But a gradual reduction this week in
Bundesbank dealing rates in the German money market has fuelled new
optimism.
A number of leading participants in the foreign exchange market predicted
more sterling falls in the absence of a German rate cut and any
clarification of UK economic policy. 'Until this latest row, I had pencilled
in a low of DM2.40,' said one leading currency fund manager in London. 'But
colleagues now believe sterling could drop to DM2.30 unless a coherent UK
economic strategy materialises.'
The unrelieved strength of the D-Mark kept the Spanish peseta close to its
ERM floor and forced Spain's government to deny rumours of another
devaluation. The peseta closed against the D-Mark at Pta70.42, close to its
ERM floor of Pta72.62.
Sterling's weakness has triggered new fears of a devaluation of the Irish
punt, which hit a high of Pounds 1.055 yesterday.
Irish officials have said the punt should not strengthen above Pounds 1.05
because of the close trading relationship between the UK and Ireland.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Perot rejoins race for US presidency to sort out 'mess'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AUSTIN, TEXAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROSS PEROT yesterday afternoon rejoined the race for the US presidency,
ending the suspense that has surrounded his intentions. The Texan
billionaire announced in Dallas that he would run as an independent
candidate in response to the call of his volunteers 'to put our financial
house back in order'.
Without mentioning President George Bush or Governor Bill Clinton by name,
he said he had withdrawn his prospective effort in July to give the two main
parties a chance to address the real economic issues worrying the country.
'They didn't do it,' he declared.
Mr Perot's statement was followed by a few words from his running mate,
retired Admiral James Stockdale, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam and now
at Stanford University in California. Mr Stockdale said he was running for
the veterans of America, but conceded, as Mr Perot did not, that they
started as underdogs.
The magnitude of the struggle was immediately provided by a CNN/USA Today
poll taken this week, after a Perot candidacy became increasingly probable.
It gave Mr Clinton 52 per cent, President Bush 35 per cent and Mr Perot a
meagre 7 per cent. His negative ratings, at 66 per cent, far exceeded those
of Mr Clinton (38 per cent) and Mr Bush (56 per cent.)
His statement, delivered in the presence of his large family and the
Stockdales, was vintage Perot, containing many of the refrains from the
heady days of late spring when he briefly topped some public opinion polls.
He was a product of the American dream, he said, meaning that 'nobody else
could be so obligated to serve'. The American people are 'good' but
government 'is a mess', and so was politics, which, he went on, should not
attract 'ego-driven, power-hungry people' - a description often applied by
his critics to Mr Perot.
Perhaps aware of a flood of new accusations about his penchant for launching
private investigations, including some of his own 'volunteers', he declared.
'I will not spend one minute of my time answering questions not directly
related to the concerns of the American people.'
It remains to be seen what attitudes the Bush and Clinton campaigns,
hitherto solicitous towards him, take towards Mr Perot now that he has come
out in the open. It is also not clear if he will be given a place at the
debating table with the two leading candidates, assuming such confrontations
are arranged.
Both camps were still negotiating terms in Washington yesterday. Both have
previously said that if Mr Perot were in the race it would be hard to
exclude him.

FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes' dissident calls for support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Murray, the dissident shareholder who holds a 26.6 per cent stake
in Andrews Sykes, the industrial services and environmental products group,
yesterday attacked the company's recent financial performance and called on
shareholders to support his bid to gain control of the board.
Andrews Sykes has set October 16 as the date for an extraordinary meeting
called at the request of Mr Murray who is demanding the removal of Mr David
Hubbard, chairman, and Mr David Crowe, a non-executive director, from the
5-man board and their replacement by himself and three of his associates.
In a letter to shareholders Mr Murray highlighted the 'repeated failure to
achieve expected levels of profitability' since 1989, and urged them to back
his resolutions.
Mr Murray, who holds his equity stake through two investment vehicles,
European Fire Protection Holding and Midland Bank Overseas Nominees, noted
that pre-tax profits had declined by 81 per cent since 1989, claimed that
profits have been 'shored up' by a pension fund surplus, and that dividends
have been paid from reserves in the past two years 'despite a clear need to
preserve resources.'
In an earlier letter Mr Hubbard strongly recommended shareholders to vote
against Mr Murray's resolutions, which he said was an 'unmerited and
unwelcome attempt to gain control of the company.'

The US Senate voted on Wednesday to authorise Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) in
military aid to Bosnia in a signal of frustration and anger at new reports
of massacres and aggression by Serbian attackers.
The aid for Bosnia - military material from Defence Department stocks -
would be conditional on lifting of a UN ban on supplying arms to the
combatants and US allies being prepared to join the aid effort.
Senator Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, proposing the aid, said the UN
embargo had left the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina unarmed against a ruthless
and heavily armed enemy.

FT  02 OCT 92 / City leaders bemoan lack of clear policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS and financial leaders in the UK warned yesterday that the absence
of a coherent economic policy and Britain's potential isolation from Europe
could damage the country's prospects for economic growth.
As the latest tussle between the German and UK authorities simmered,
industrialists and financiers urged the government to rid the country of
uncertainty by adopting a clear economic strategy.  Some said that it would
take a new chancellor of the exchequer to implement it.
Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, urged the government
to make a clear commitment to the Maastricht agreement. One bank chairman,
who refused to be named, said 'I am extremely concerned at the absence of an
economic policy in the UK.'
Mr David Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, the packaging and printing group,
which has extensive activities in mainland Europe, said it was essential for
the government to re-establish order in its management of exchange-rate
policy.
'We want order and certainty. In the absence of that we have huge movements
of cash swinging around the world not driven by trade but by people
speculating in money. That volatility is hugely damaging,' he said.
Mr Geoffrey Shingles, the UK head of Digital Equipment, the largest US
minicomputer manufacturer, said he was angered and frustrated by the
government's inability to bring down interest rates to a level which would
help industry.
The problems were a lack of stability and certainty compounded by interest
rates which were delaying capital investment.
Arguing that the German position was correct, he said of the UK government:
'They have got themselves in a ridiculous situation. They had the chance to
rebalance the economy and they threw it away.' Mr Ken Schofield, chief
executive of MTM, the chemicals group, said: 'The new row between the German
and British authorities is the final nail in Mr Lamont's coffin. We need a
new face who can make some difficult decisions.'
Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, said 'Mr Lamont has to go
if the government is to come up with a clear-cut statement on economic
policy.'
Another fear was that foreign companies could become nervous about investing
in a country whose position and influence in Europe was questionable.
'The fact that we are seen to be unstable and isolated cannot help prospects
for inward investment and future business links with Europe,' said Ms Ruth
Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank in London.
Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of the Tyne and Wear Development
Corporation, warned that any uncertainty about Britain's future in the EC
would make it much harder to attract investors to the UK.
'Our biggest selling point in east Asia and the US is our position inside
the single market of 350m customers,' he said. 'Any doubt about that would
weaken our attraction.'

FT  02 OCT 92 / Praise for Angola's democratic debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLIANS received praise from the west yesterday as they awaited the
results of almost incident-free presidential and parliamentary elections,
the country's democratic debut after three decades of civil war.
Although partial preliminary results released by the National Electoral
Commission gave the ruling MPLA and its President Jose Eduardo dos Santos an
early lead, these were based on between 2 and 5 per cent of the vote in
barely half of the country.
Full results are not expected for another day or two. If the trend is
confirmed, however, the key question will be whether the Unita former rebels
of Mr Jonas Savimbi will accept the outcome.
The European Community urged yesterday that all sides 'should now work
together to rebuild Angola in a spirit of tolerance and reconciliation.' A
statement from the British presidency committed the community and member
states 'to give what help they can to the reconstruction of the country.'
The people of Angola should 'take up their primary responsibility for
ensuring stability in order to hold on to the democratic values so dearly
won,' it went on.
During polling on Tuesday and Wednesday, Unita leaders expressed cautious
satisfaction with the way it was being conducted. But they had warned that
they would regard the result as invalid unless all supporters of the
movement who were registered to vote had the opportunity to do so.
In one of the few outbreaks of violence, Unita supporters shot dead a guard
to Mr Armindo Espirito Santo Viera, deputy interior minister. They also
occupied houses near Mr Savimbi's residence, saying his life was in danger.
Logistical problems meant ballot boxes and electoral material arrived late
in some areas, but the national turnout was estimated yesterday at more than
80 per cent. Late returns and power cuts delayed counting.
In the capital Luanda, an MPLA stronghold, with 5.3 per cent of the votes
counted Mr Dos Santos had 73.7 per cent in the presidential race against
19.1 per cent for Mr Savimbi. In Benguela to the south, where Unita was
strongest, based on 1.7 per cent of the vote counted Mr Savimbi was also
trailing, with 42.1 per cent against 53.5 per cent for Mr Dos Santos.

FT  02 OCT 92 / BR 'victim of industrial espionage': Fresh allegations in
bribery case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLASSER Railway Machinery GB, the rail maintenance suppliers charged with
bribing British Rail staff, benefited from industrial espionage committed by
someone inside BR's civil engineering department, an Old Bailey court heard
yesterday.
Police who raided Plasser's London offices in September 1988 found two sets
of confidential documents belonging to BR in the desk drawers of Mr Norbert
Jurasek, Plasser managing director, and Mr Michael Brooks, company
secretary, the court was told.
Mr Michael Worsley QC, prosecuting, said the documents included engineering
drawings submitted to BR as part of a tender by NEI, a rival of Plasser, and
confidential details of future BR policy. One sinister aspect was that
identifying features had been removed from the documents.
Plasser, Mr Jurasek, and Mr Brooks all deny nine charges of offering bribes
to Mr David Currie, a former head of BR's civil engineering department. Mr
Currie denies nine charges of accepting bribes. All four deny a single
charge of trying to bribe other BR staff.
Mr Worsley said there was no evidence that it had been Mr Currie who had
stolen the documents. However, the only sensible conclusion was that the
documents had been stolen by somebody in the civil engineering department.
The person responsible would not have passed them on unless it was
worthwhile.
'You may think it is an example of bribery working,' Mr Worsley told the
jury.
Earlier, the court heard how Mr Currie had denied to police ever breaking
BR's guidelines on accepting gifts from companies BR did business with.
The code of conduct, introduced when Sir Peter Parker was chairman, said
that to preserve BR's integrity, only 'trifling' gifts such as diaries and
calendars could be accepted. More substantial gifts had to be refused and
clarification sought from superiors when staff were in doubt.
Mr Currie, though, had accepted air tickets from Plasser worth thousands of
pounds along with other gifts, Mr Worsley said. Sir Robert Reid, a former BR
chairman, once accepted a Christmas present of a case of wine from Plasser,
but refused to accept more substantial gifts, he went on.
Another BR executive was given a case of wine after he asked Plasser to stop
sending him gifts. He poured the wine down a sink and protested to the
company, Mr Worsley said.
On one trip to a Viennese night club called Eve's, staff from BR's civil
engineering department ran up a bill of more than Pounds 3,000 - which was
paid by Plasser.
The case continues on Monday.

flotation next year, is to close nearly a quarter of its regional offices
and make 100 staff redundant.
It will shut five of its 22 offices outside London - Brighton, Guildford,
Milton Keynes, Hull and Sheffield - in response to changing economic
patterns and improved motorway communications, Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief
executive said.
3i has nearly completed installing a computerised accounting and information
system that will lead to the loss of 60 jobs in London. A further 40 jobs,
including 30 executives, will go as a result of the regional closures,
reducing 3i's total staff to 560.
The cuts, Mr Macpherson said, were related not to 3i's planned flotation but
to the tougher economic climate. .3i is taking on 100 new cases a month,
compared with 150 a month two to three years ago.
The office closures will still leave 3i with the most extensive branch
network of any UK venture capital company, although there has been
speculation about 3i's ability to maintain such a network after flotation.
Mr Macpherson said the cuts did not signal any change in the types of
investment 3i was prepared to back. The new computer system would allow for
a more automated handling of small and relatively costly investments.

FT  02 OCT 92 / De Hooch may fetch Pounds 6.5m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the masterpieces of the 'golden age' of Dutch painting, 'The
Courtyard of a House in Delft' by Pieter de Hooch, is to be sold at
Christie's in London on December 11.
Up to Pounds 6.5m is expected for the work, which creates illusions of space
by views through half-opened doors. It was painted by de Hooch in 1658 and
is similar to a picture in the National Gallery depicting the same
courtyard.
If it reaches its target price, the Old Master should achieve the highest
price in the autumn saleroom season. In the same sale, Christie's is
offering five works by Rubens, including a portrait of Madame de Vicq that
has been lost from view since it sold at Christie's in 1848 for 205 guineas.
Phillips won the competition to be the auction house to dispose of the stock
of David Messum, the leading dealer in British Impressionist paintings,
whose London gallery recently went into receivership.
In all, 600 paintings with a value of at least Pounds 900,000 will be sold
over two years, with the first auction on November 17 including works by Sir
John Lavery and Matthew Smith.
In New York on Wednesday, Sotheby's achieved an auction record for a comic.
A copy of the first issue of Action Comics, published in June 1938, sold for
Dollars 82,500 (Pounds 47,210).
It features the first appearance of Superman.

El Oro Mining and Exploration, an investment dealing company, saw its
pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 779,000 in the first half of
1992.
Interest income fell as a result of lower UK interest rates and two
substantial dividends paid since the last half year.
Earnings per share came through at 12.55p (16.51p).
Group assets at market value were nearly Pounds 25m (Pounds 25.8m). The
group held some Pounds 3m in cash, bonds and high yielding preference
shares.
El Oro owns over 50 per cent of Exploration Company, which in turn is
interested in nearly 40 per cent of El Oro.
Exploration reports a pre-tax profit of Pounds 967,000 (Pounds 1.34m) and
earnings per share of 5.78p (7.57p).
Its assets at market value were Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 30.9m). Some Pounds 7m
was in cash, bonds and high yielding preference shares.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Letter: Industrial logic sole reason for unions' merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From BILL MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report ('TGWU confirms merger plan', September 26) on my union's
new relationship with Britain's other general union, the GMB, is misleading
in its implication that our financial situation has played a part in our
desire to develop a partnership, possibly leading to a merger.
First, I wish to make it clear that industrial logic, and only industrial
logic, shapes the T&amp;G's merger strategy. It is that logic, which serves the
interests of our members at the workplace, which has led me top seek to
forge closer links with the GMB. We organise in the same industries and face
similar problems and opportunities. The same logic will apply in the T&amp;G's
developing relationships with other trade unions.
Second, your report does not fairly represent the T&amp;G's financial position.
More than half of our deficit last year was caused by one-off payments
relating to an early retirement scheme for officers and staff. That is one
of the measures we have taken to put ourselves on a firm footing for the
future. Our budgeted target was to break-even at the end of the year. Not
only are we on course to meet this, but all our projections indicate that we
shall substantially exceed the break-even point.
That is despite continuing membership losses caused by the crisis in the
manufacturing industries.
Our strong asset base, one of the largest in the British trade union
movement, ensures that we can look to alliances based on industrial logic
and for no other reason.

SKANDIA, a leading Swedish insurance group, yesterday cancelled plans to
sell a majority shareholding in its US subsidiary Skandia America Corp
(SAC). Plans to introduce SAC's shares on the New York Stock Exchange have
also been abandoned.
The group said it took the decision because 'the final offering price for
the SAC shares would not be in the best interest of the Skandia group, in
view of the current international market situation'.
Skandia planned to issue 9m shares, but decided the Dollars 18 per share
level was too low. When it first announced the filing in July, it was hoping
to get Dollars 25 per share. SAC's reinsurance operations in the US and
Canada recorded net premium volume of SKr2.55bn in 1991.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: First tri-party repurchase
agreement in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Swiss Bank Corporation
and Cedel yesterday announced the first tri-party repurchase agreement
(repo) programme to be launched in Europe.
Under the agreement, the EBRD lends cash to SBC, which in exchange deposits
collateral with Cedel, which provides the back-office function.
Tri-party programmes, which reduce the risk of failed trades, are designed
to encourage participation by companies
often deterred by the com-plex back-office processing involved in repurchase
agreements.
In the US, where such tri-party deals are common, outstandings in the repo
market have reached around Dollars 1,000bn.
The European repo market - involving direct trades between two
counterparties - is estimated at just Dollars 100bn. The advent of tri-party
agreements could mean its expansion.
Mr Mark Mazzonelli, a director of SBC, said: 'The objective of the tri-party
programme is to broaden and deepen the multi-currency repo market. . . by
providing easy entry for those institutions, specifically corporations,
which were unable or reluctant to enter the repo market in the past.'
Prior to the agreement, the EBRD had already been active in the repo market
on a direct basis. The bank has around 20 per cent of its Ecu2bn of
liquidity invested in the repo market, according to Mr Rene Karsenti, the
bank's treasurer.
The EBRD finds the repo market 'superior to bank deposits, because it
provides us with collateral and offers better returns', Mr Karsenti said.
SBC will not on-lend the cash, but will use the funds to finance its trading
inventory, according to Mr Mazzonelli.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Suez warns that provisions will
affect interim profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUEZ, one of France's most powerful financial and industrial groups,
yesterday warned that first-half profits would fall below expectations this
year because of the impact of the fragile French property market on Indosuez
and La Henin, its main banking subsidiaries.
Suez yesterday announced that its net profits would be significantly below
the FFr1.8bn (Dollars 350m) it made in the first six months of last year,
because of a hefty rise in provisions, mainly on property.
The group anticipates an increase in provisions from FFr400m in the first
half of 1991 to at least FFr2bn in the same period this year.
However, Suez stressed that it expected to remain profitable in 1992 and
said its dividend policy would remain unchanged.
In spite of this assurance its shares fell on the profits warning, tumbling
as low as FFr226 then recovering to close at FFr236.2, down FFr3.3 on the
day.
The Suez announcement follows a series of lacklustre interim results from
French financial groups, all of which have been hit by falling property
values and the rise in small business fail-ures.
The French property market has come under intense pressure this year because
of the sluggish economic climate and the relatively high rate of real
interest rates.
Paribas, the investment banking group, announced on Tuesday that it was only
able to avoid a steep fall in interim profits because of the pro-ceeds of
its disposal programme.
Credit Lyonnais, one of France's biggest banks, last week disclosed that it
only just broke even in the first half.
Indosuez saw its net profits fall sharply to just FFr81m during the first
half from FFr517m in the same period last year.
Operating profits mustered growth of 10 per cent to FFr1.66bn, against
FFr1.5bn, on net banking income which rose by 8 per cent to FFr5.49bn.
But the precarious state of the property market forced the bank to raise
provisions from FFr544m to FFr1.39bn.
Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman, warned that provisions would
remain high in the second half.
Meanwhile, Banque La Henin barely broke even during the first half with net
profits of just FFr6m compared with FFr66m in the first six months of 1991.
The group mustered a marginal increase in operating profits, but was hit by
the need to make hefty provisions on its property interests.

SUN ALLIANCE, the composite (general and life) insurance company, is to
extend its links with the US company, Chubb Insurance, by launching a new
jointly underwritten and marketed home contents policy in the UK.
The policy, branded 'Masterpiece', is geared to the needs of the wealthy,

US.
In the US, Chubb insures 200 of the 400 wealthiest Americans listed by
Forbes magazine. In North America alone Chubb insures more than 12,000
dwellings for more than Dollars 1m each, in addition to many thousands of
fine art and jewellery collections.
Sun Alliance and Chubb own 9 per cent of each other's equity capital. Sun
Alliance also reinsures (via a quota share treaty) 10 per cent of Chubb's
specialty lines and 15.75 per cent of its standard lines business.
Chubb has been one of the most consistently profitable US insurers.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Computer characters
champing at the bit - Gary Mead finds battle already joined in the Christmas
toy trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
October 1 - it must be time to start thinking about Christmas. At least,
that's the reasoning of manufacturers and retailers eager to grab a slice of
this year's estimated Pounds 1bn spending on gadgets, games and gizmos for
children.
Among those ready for take-off are the world's two leading producers of
electronic video games, Sega and Nintendo, both Japanese companies with a
global reach. Their march into the living rooms of the industrialised world
has strafed the traditional toy market and demolished a central icon of
American folksiness, the baseball bat.
According to Nintendo, electronic video games outnumber baseball bats in the
US. That warms the heart of Brian Moore, senior product manager at Bandai
UK, which markets Nintendo products in Britain; where the US has pioneered,
the UK will follow.
In the US and Japan, electronic video games have a 40 per cent household
penetration; that drops to just 14 per cent in the UK, though 50 per cent of
British homes with children have some form of electronic video game
installed. There is thus room for growth - and room for a mega-drive
marketing battle.
Peter Skinner, marketing manager of Hamleys, the London toy shop, says
electronic video games were 'the biggest selling toy item last Christmas and
we expect the same this year'.
Nintendo and Sega calculate the retail value of the UK market will be Pounds
500m this year - almost double that of 1991, and about half of all toy sales
 -from a standing start of just Pounds 20m in 1989.
Worldwide, Nintendo claims to have sold 615m items of games hardware in the
last six years, 10m of those in the UK. In the US, Nintendo claims the
retail value of its sales alone this year will be Dollars 4.8bn.
Nintendo claims an overall 80 per cent share of the international video
games market but clearly there is a marketing battle in progress over the
hearts and pockets of the world's children.
According to the UK magazine, Computer Trade Weekly, Sega dominates the
emerging and more technologically sophisticated 16-bit game console market
in the US, with a 61 per cent share, against Nintendo's 34 per cent. The
other 5 per cent is taken by NEC.
In the UK, Nintendo is spending Pounds 15m on marketing its three versions
of hand-held, 8-bit and 16-bit consoles which plug into ordinary television
sets.
Its rival, Sega, with its own versions of the same products, claims a UK
marketing budget of Pounds 19m this year, including a Pounds 2m sponsorship
deal during the summer of Independent Television's coverage of the European
football championship. By the end of this year, Sega will have spent about
Pounds 100m on marketing across Europe.
In the UK, the less expensive hand-held games market is dominated by
Nintendo, which has about 60 per cent market share, compared with Sega's 40
per cent.
The superior technology of the 16-bit consoles means they provide the
graphics and entertainment of arcade-style video games. Sega launched its
16-bit console in the UK two years ago - Nintendo came along earlier this
year - and Sega currently appears to be winning the battle.
According to one of London's leading toy retailers, 'Nintendo has not yet
got the word-of-mouth awareness that Sega has; last week we sold seven Sega
16-bit machines and two of Nintendo's'. Price is another factor; in the UK,
Sega's 16-bit machine retails at Pounds 129, against Nintendo's Pounds 180.
To capture the high ground in the UK, both companies are launching lavish
television advertising campaigns at the start of October; Nintendo has spent
Pounds 500,000 in production costs alone.
Part of Sega's strategy has been to take a leaf out of the Hollywood movie,
Big - where a teenager suddenly finds himself transformed into an adult, and
is recruited by a toy manufacturer as a product tester - by inviting
13-15-year-olds to attend its quarterly board meetings.
According to Philip Ley, marketing director of Sega Europe: 'Their role is
to discuss our plans for Sega, future product launches, the type of software
we should be launching, reaction to our promotions and TV advertising plans.
We also set them projects in between each board meeting; for instance, one
of them was how can we make Sega more appealing to women? They have a lot of
practical imput.'
But in the long-term, both Sega and Nintendo need to broaden their appeal.
Getting noticed by kids was the priority once - 'they are our best sales
people' says Brian Moore - but the new television advertising campaigns are
aimed at enticing the relatively untapped older teenage and adult markets.
Hence Sega's interest in event sponsorship. 'We wanted to leap-frog Nintendo
in terms of the way consumers, both dads and lads, perceived Sega as a
brand. In this market place - it's not the same everywhere - big is better.
We need to be seen as a big brand because kids tend to think if you are big,
you are going to have the best technology, the best games and the biggest
number of games. What we wanted to do in a very short space of time was to
catapult Sega into, for instance, the echelons of Coca-Cola,' says Ley.
There is nothing quite like a movie for generating interest in spin-off
products. But as part of its marketing strategy, Nintendo has taken the
unusual step of manufacturing the product first and producing the movie
second.
Nintendo claims that one of its characters, Super Mario, now has a
popularity rating in the US higher than that of Mickey Mouse. Sure enough,
Mario is to feature in a 1993 movie - The Super Mario Bros - played by the
character actor Bob Hoskins.
While market saturation is not yet on the horizon, the long-term future
dictates that both Sega and Nintendo must grow into new, demographically
older, markets. 'It is not so much that we fear market saturation as that we
wish to position Sega as a large credible brand, with a future not to remain
simply in the games consoles market but, over the next few years, to become
a home entertainment brand,' says Ley.
Moore supports the view that Nintendo's three hardware products require
different marketing: 'Initially, video games had a bad perception in
parents' minds. With (the hand-held) Game Boy, we took a softly-softly
approach, introduced consumer services, a free magazine and a telephone
hotline for problems. Our profile was young. Our structure for Super NES is
different, with a more street-credible approach, to go after an older
audience.'
But for the next three months, the battlefield is squarely sited on the
playground. And the big marketing spends have one simple end - get the brand
name noticed and win credibility.
According to David King, product manager of Virgin Games, one of the larger
retailers of electronic games, 'as far as kids are concerned, at the end of
the day it all comes down to something called 'street cred'. How do you get
that street cred? If you could bottle that, you'd make a million.'

FT  01 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): InterCity plucks
ideas from the sky - Moves to woo passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's amazing how recession concentrates the mind. Faced with the prospect of
a Pounds 50m hole in its revenues this year because of a dip in ticket
sales, British Rail's InterCity business - targeted, like the rest of BR's
train operations, for eventual privatisation - is responding almost as
though it was in the private sector already.
In an attempt to defend last year's meagre Pounds 2m profit, managing
director Chris Green has already instigated a painful bout of cost-cutting.
Now he is on the attack with the most aggressive package of marketing
measures InterCity has ever deployed.
The Boots promotion is back, giving shoppers at Boots stores vouchers that
they can trade in for tickets; the existing range of airline-style Apex
fares, giving big discounts to those booking more than seven days in
advance, are extended to all InterCity journeys of more than 150 miles; and
a new Leisure First ticket will offer half-price, first-class travel to
people whose journeys away include a Saturday night.
But the most interesting innovations are in customer service. Hosts and
hostesses, for example, will be on hand at big stations to welcome
travellers and help them; on-board trolley catering services will serve all
passengers at their seats; and restaurant cars will be turned into
bistro-style Express Diners offering much wider choice.
Another innovation pinched from InterCity's airline rivals is the planned
repackaging of frequent services, such as London-Birmingham and
London-Bristol, as InterCity Shuttles. The idea is that passengers setting
out from one end or the other of these routes will no longer need to worry
about timetables: they will be able to turn up at a designated platform at
any hour of the day knowing that a train will be there, ready to depart and
with its buffet open.
Backing the marketing effort is a slightly baffling television advertisement
from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi called InterCity Train Magic ('Welcome to a city,'
goes the voice-over, 'a city where the only jams are on the table . . . ').
Like the marketing campaign itself, it puts a heavy emphasis on customer
service.
Of course, the unanswered question in all of this is why Chris Green and his
colleagues can be bothered to put such an effort into the business, given
InterCity's limited life expectancy in its present form.
Then again, Green has made clear that he will vigorously resist any break-up
of InterCity as part of the privatisation process. Modesty, however, has so
far forbidden him from suggesting who might be running it in the
post-privatisation world.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Accountancy Column: Open season on closing the expectations
gap - New studies which call for a radical shake-up within the auditing
profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY not look very threatening from the outside, with its plain cover and
its bland binding, but the latest work published by the research board of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales this week should
be handled with care.
Hidden inside the plain red cover, the text of 'The audit expectations gap
in the UK'* by three academics is a ticking timebomb of revolutionary reform
for the audit profession. An independent regulatory body should oversee the
appointment, fee levels and practices of auditors of large companies, the
authors say.
Auditors' responsibilities should be expanded beyond existing shareholders.
And, in case that is not enough, their role should be expanded to include
the detection of material fraud.
Such conclusions might have barely have generated a dismissive wave from the
more cynical members of the profession if they had been new outpourings from
the troublesome trio of 'radical accountants', Messers Prem Sikka, Tony
Puxty and Hugh Willmott. But the latest salvo comes instead from three other
dons, adding new weight to calls for fundamental change, and funded by the
institute's own auditing research foundation. They are Stuart Turley and
Christopher Humphrey of the University of Manchester, and Peter Moizer from
the University of Leeds.
It is to the credit of the institute that it was willing to fund and publish
a report which can hardly be said to echo its own views. But the findings
are hardly going down well for many in Moorgate Place, its London
headquarters.
That is clear enough even from the press release which accompanies the book.
Mr Henry Gold, technical director of the institute, is quoted as saying that
the case for an independent regulator is not developed sufficiently in the
report to be analysed. He also doubts whether the responsibility for
detecting fraud could be effective.
The three authors begin by defining the so-called 'expectations gap' - a
phrase first used by the Cohen Commission in the US in 1974 - in a careful,
neutral way: the gap between the service expected by non-auditors and that
provided by auditors.
Soon, they are citing an all-too-familiar complaint from one firm. 'We have
been allowed to audit not from month to month but only once a year; having
had too little time to make an exhaustive report; knowing that shareholders
are generally impatient to get through the business; being paid a fee out of
all proportion to the work done; and being aware that the voting power is in
the absolute control of the board . . . (shareholders imagine) that
auditors' certificates are proofs of all excellences and complete solvency
and security.'
That might well relate to any of the litany of corporate collapses of the
last decade. In fact it was taken from an article written in 1883, referring
to the financial scandal surrounding the City of Glasgow Bank in 1878.
The authors' point is that the idea of a perception gap - or many different
gaps - between auditors and others has both a long history and parallels in
many parts of the world. Yet the auditors' response over this time has been
both highly defensive and relatively static, the authors argue.
Some firms have offered additional services such as specific fraud audits in
compensation. But these have generally been services for management rather
than for users of financial statements, and have served chiefly to deflect
attention away from the potentially limited nature of current audit
practice.
However, the most typical response has been to blame the ignorance of the
public, and to try to educate them in the 'true' purpose of the audit. A
recent example is the Auditing Practices Board's proposals for an expanded
audit statement - echoed in the Cadbury report - which clarifies the
existing legal responsibilities of directors and auditors.
Meanwhile, shareholder involvement in running companies has continued to
decline over time, leaving directors with the effective power to hire and
fire the auditors, raising considerable questions over auditors'
independence.
At the same time, the concentration of the audit market into the hands of a
small number of firms has intensified, and the firms themselves are being
transformed from professional partnerships into fiercely-competitive, high
turnover businesses.
Neither periodically rotating audit firms nor 'quaranteening' audit from
other services offered to the same client would free them from 'the
arbitrary patronage of company management', the authors say.
Recent changes to regulation have only dealt indirectly with the
relationship between auditors and directors, while the process of auditing
remains largely hidden from the vast majority of those who rely on the work
of the firms.
They argue for an office for auditing to oversee appointments and fees for
large companies with a clear public investigatory mandate. They say that
auditors' duty of care should be extended to cover both existing and
potential shareholders and creditors, rather than simply existing
shareholders, as the Caparo judgment in the House of Lords ruled.
Finally, the authors say that the real issue in the expectations gap is that
the public expects auditors to detect all serious fraud. That same
expectation has been as recurrent over the years as auditors' attempts to
downplay it.
It is welcome to see an academic paper drawing frequently on popular
articles - including those in the Financial Times and Accountancy Age -
alongside more dusty journals and books as part of its thesis.
One sad omission is of any critique or even reference to the work of their
rival radicals, led by Prem Sikka of the former East London Polytechnic. The
latest of their many works on the expectations gap was published by the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants this June**.
Wrapped in rather more sociological jargon, these authors make many similar
points, and argue that the expectation that auditors should detect material
fraud has been recognised and debated quite publicly many times in the past
and rejected. They suggest that auditors should actively attempt to detect
fraud, and that their responsibilities should be explicitly laid down in
law.
There is also a more fundamental problem in the report by Humphrey, Moizer
and Turley, however. There is a strong leap of logic from the empirical
analysis of perceptions of the role of auditors - which represents the bulk
of their first-hand research - to the recommendations with which they
conclude.
The fact that groups of individuals - including financial journalists and
bankers - perceive that auditors are not doing enough and that their role
should change, does not necessarily justify such changes. Neither of these
groups pays for the work of auditors.
If such a change is going to take place, the authors - or indeed the
accounting profession - need to take far more seriously the question of both
how much it will cost and who will foot the bill.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY-NINE buildings win regional awards for architecture from the Royal
Institute of British Architects today.
The Riba awards are intended to recognise buildings considered 'outstanding
examples of current architecture'. The winners range from a simple house
extension in Edinburgh to two sports buildings in Sheffield designed for the
World Student Games. The most successful building type was office
developments - 10 win awards, ranging from converted farm buildings in
Shropshire to the Reuters building in London's Docklands.
The multi-storey car park (pictured) in Chichester is among those honoured.
The architects, Birds Portchmouth Russum, fitted the building into the city
by extending the city wall. The jury said: 'The building makes valuable and
acceptable a building type that is usually considered unglamorous. The
analysis of the various areas that touch the site and how they can be
redefined by the building shows great clarity of thought.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN banks yesterday lifted their prime lending rates by a record two
percentage points, in response to moves by the Bank of Canada to defend the
Canadian dollar.
The rise in prime rate, from 6.25 per cent to 8.25 per cent, reverses the
steep downward trend in Canadian interest rates, which began in mid-1990
when prime was at 14.75 per cent.
The sharp rise in rates over the past few days has stabilised the dollar,
which was trading little changed yesterday at about 80 US cents.
Bond prices staged a modest rally.
Canadian financial markets were unsettled in early September by the upheaval
in European currencies, but the turbulence has been exacerbated by fears of
the economic consequences of a No vote in the referendum on a new Canadian
constitution on October 26. Recent opinion polls show the No side
comfortably ahead in Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta.
Supporters of the constitutional deal are hoping that fear of further
economic turmoil will help them make up ground as the referendum approaches.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based shipping company, has lost its attempt to
acquire the Queen Mary, the former Cunard flagship moored as a tourist
attraction in Long Beach, California.
The City of Long Beach, which bought the vessel in 1967, rejected Sea
Containers' bid yesterday after deciding to seek a local operator rather
than see the liner towed overseas.
The California port has been seeking buyers for the 56-year-old vessel
following Walt Disney's decision not to renew its lease on the site near Los
Angeles.
Harbour officials had been expected to sell the liner to a Hong Kong
consortium before the city council suspended the bidding process.
The Queen Mary has been losing Dollars 5m a year as a floating museum and
hotel. Repairs needed to make the ship seaworthy have been estimated at
Dollars 27m by US marine engineers and its scrap value would not cover the
cost of towing her to the breakers' yard.
Supporters of the Sea Containers bid said they were disappointed by the
decision.

FT  01 OCT 92 / MMI stops new policy sales after rescue fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUNICIPAL MUTUAL, the stricken local authority-owned insurance company,
yesterday ceased to sell new policies or renew existing ones after
acknowledging that rescue talks with a French insurer had broken down.
Existing policies will remain in force, although MMI is placing a seven-day
moratorium on claims payments while it explores arrangements which would
allow it to meet claims arising from existing policies.
The announcement led to fresh criticism last night of the Department of
Trade and Industry, which regulates the insurance industry.
Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, said: 'The ninth
largest insurance group in the country is creeping towards insolvency
without sight or sound of the Department of Trade and Industry. Why have we
not heard from the president of the Board of Trade? Where is he?'
It ends a confusing few days in which MMI insisted that talks with
Paris-based Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires would take place despite
statements to the press by the French company on Monday that it was no
longer interested in acquiring MMI's business.
MMI originally reached agreement in principle to transfer its business to
GMF in July. Its future has been in doubt since it reported net assets down
to Pounds 4.9m in May, well below solvency margins generally accepted as
adequate in the industry.
Local authorities will press creditors to accept a 'scheme of arrangement'
which would avert a full-scale liquidation of Municipal Mutual.
Last night, Jardine Insurance Brokers notified councils of a temporary
Lloyd's of London facility for many risks.
Mr Geoff Filkin, secretary of the Association of District Councils, said
local authorities associations would meet MMI today to 'see the best ways of
dealing with the company's assets and liabilities.'
MMI is in talks with leading insurers to transfer some parts of its
business, including its portfolio of home and motor policies, to other
insurers.
Its Prime Health health insurance subsidiary will continue to write new
business, while its life assurance subsidiary, Prosperity Life, will write
renewals but not issue new policies.
Cheltenham and Gloucester building society said yesterday that it had agreed
to transfer all 216,000 MMI policies which it had already sold to its
mortgage borrowers to General Accident, the Perth-based insurer. GA is also
to write C&amp;G's new business.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Oilseed row raises fears of US-EC trade war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has given the European Community until noon today to agree to binding
arbitration on its oilseed subsidy regime, twice condemned by a panel of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as contrary to Gatt rules.
Rejection by the EC, which has consistently refused any form of binding
procedure, would bring the Community to the brink of all-out trade war with
the US just as senior officials from both sides are planning a push to break
the deadlock in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
Equally critical, the ultimatum shows that the US is threatening to abandon
Gatt as a channel for resolving this dispute, endangering the foundations of
the trade system overseen by Gatt.
Trading partners have become increasingly anxious in recent years that US
frustration with the Gatt system of resolving disputes will tempt it to use
its might to settle them unilaterally.
Mr Julius Katz, deputy US trade representative, said in Washington: 'If the
proposal is rejected, that pretty much exhausts the Gatt process and we will
have to draw appropriate conclusions. However, there is still the
possibility of a negotiated agreement.'
Washington stopped short of saying it would impose prohibitive tariffs on
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 580m) of EC food imports if Brussels does not act
swiftly to remedy the trade losses to US soyabean farmers from its subsidy
regime.
Mr Katz said the US might continue talks with the EC in the hope of averting
a trade war.
The EC has refused to change the subsidy system, offering other trade
concessions which have been rejected by the US and other oilseed producers.
Brussels says it will retaliate if the US imposes sanctions.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to the Gatt, told Gatt's governing council the
US was insisting on an effective procedure to determine 'once and for all'
whether the EC was going to implement the panel findings on oilseeds or
whether aggrieved parties had the right to retaliate.
Mr Yerxa said the US could not accept EC proposals made late on Tuesday for
a loosely structured working group with no powers to arbitrate.
Under the original US proposal, a three-member panel would determine within
30 days how much damage the EC subsidy regime caused oilseed exporters. If
the Community rejected the panel findings, trading partners would have the
right to retaliate.
The US has put global trading losses at Dollars 2bn a year, with its own
soyabean farmers accounting for Dollars 1bn. The EC says the figure is no
more than Dollars 400m.
EC and US officials have recently expressed hopes that the oilseeds row
could be settled this month in the context of a broader Uruguay Round deal.
This would involve a separate accord on oilseeds consistent with a final
overall deal on reducing farm subsidies.
'An oilseeds deal would be a nice confidence-building agreement for the
Uruguay Round. I don't see how we can come up with a Uruguay Round
settlement without one,' one EC trade negotiator said.

It seems that the trading position at Ratners is not completely hopeless,
and ordinary shareholders may keep going long enough to be heavily diluted
by the banks and preference shareholders. Better control of costs and
working capital is part of the answer, and one wonders how much better the
group might have fared if it had acted earlier, rather than continuing with
acquisitions as the recessionary storm gathered. Mr Gerald Ratner's salary,
now modestly below Pounds 400,000, is defended on the grounds of his
continuing contribution to the group. Shareholders may see matters
differently.

Things appear to be going more Eurotunnel's way, which is just as well given

The shares closed at 420p last night, just a touch above the 416p exercise

heartening arbitration decision should not be confused with the still
unresolved negotiations with the contractors, while the impact of falling
interest rates should not be exaggerated. Real interest rates are the key,
and here Eurotunnel's projections still look optimistic.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's emergency package from the Swedish government seems to have
impressed the markets rather more than last week's effort. The cut in
private-sector payroll taxes will help make Swedish companies more
competitive without resorting to devaluation. The government's determination
to tackle its fiscal problems has allowed a cut in interest rates, easing
pressure on the economy and the financial system.
But it would be wrong to conclude that Sweden is out of the wood. The tax
changes will add only 2 or 3 per cent to international corporate
competitiveness. Purchasing power estimates suggest the krona is overvalued
by 10 to 15 per cent. Added to that, Finland, which competes with Sweden in
forest products, has devalued the markka by around a quarter in the last
year. The fiscal problems are still enormous: the 1992-93 budget deficit is
likely to reach 12 per cent of GDP as the economy slows.
Indeed, in the short term, action to slim the bloated public sector may make
matters worse. Part of the pressure on the krona has come from the belief
that Sweden cannot maintain high interest rates for long because the economy
is so weak. Cuts in government spending will deepen the recession.
Ultimately, however, the fate of the krona will be decided elsewhere. If
pressure on the ERM as a whole subsides, the Swedes may get time to sort out
their long term structural problems. If not, they will suffer a similar
humiliation to Britain at the hands of the market.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Bank of Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Scotland has seen some erosion in its premium over the rest of the
sector over the past year. But a running yield of little more than 5 per
cent still suggests the market is expecting above average growth. In that
context, an increase of only 3 per cent in first-half profits before
provisions is disappointing news. It compares, for example, with a
first-half increase of 16 per cent at Barclays and 11 per cent at National
Westminster. Although the measure is crude, profits before provisions were
only 16 per cent of shareholders funds at the halfway stage compared with 21
per cent for both Barclays and NatWest.
Arguably a smaller return is justified by Bank of Scotland's sound lending
record and low provision rate compared with its peers. It could also be
sensible to expand lending at the bottom of the cycle when competition is
thin and collateral values have already fallen. Yet, the nagging worry
remains that the return is too low.
Part of the problem is a rapid rise in operating costs. Part is almost
certainly the bank's relatively heavy dependence on expensive wholesale
funding. Its reluctance to develop an extensive branch network south of the
border makes it harder to attract retail deposits. By concentrating on these
issues as well as volume, the bank could enhance its earnings. That might
slow the fall in its tier 1 capital ratio. At 6.1 per cent the figure is
perfectly comfortable, but it is still 0.7 points lower than a year ago.

FT  01 OCT 92 / US report on BCCI likely tocriticise Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONDUCT of the Bank of England is expected to be severely criticised
today in an 800-page report on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
scandal to be released in the US Senate.
The report, which follows a four-year investigation led by Senator John
Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, will pre-empt some of the findings of the
still unpublished UK report on BCCI by Lord Bingham.
Yesterday, Mr Kerry said: 'We've known for a while that the BCCI scandal
would turn out to be the biggest example of financial crime in recent
memory, but it also demonstrates a grotesque network of greed and
influence.'
Others who are expected to be criticised in the report include the
government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholders of the collapsed BCCI,
and Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditor.
Abu Dhabi has been repeatedly criticised by Mr Kerry and US prosecutors for
its withholding of documents and witnesses from US authorities. Last week
Abu Dhabi's Washington lobbyists claimed Abu Dhabi was now co- operating
with the US.
Abu Dhabi's Washington representatives said that 19,000 pages of
BCCI-related documents would be made available to US authorities, but US
officials will not be allowed to take physical possession of them and will
be permitted only to review them at the Washington embassy of the United
Arab Emirates.
Separately, it has been learnt that US officials are investigating the role
of Abu Dhabi in the BCCI affair. Abu Dhabi has always described itself as a
victim of the BCCI fraud and has said it lost billions of dollars as a
result of the scandal.
British Foreign Office officials are understood to have been trying to
monitor the timing of the Kerry report's release in recent weeks; the report
has been delayed by one week past its originally scheduled publication date.
UK officials are understood to have been especially worried that the report
might have been released during the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund meetings in Washington last week.
Mr Kerry, whose Senate sub-committee has held 14 public hearings and one
closed session on BCCI over the past four years, has made use of the
testimony of dozens of witnesses and several hundred thousand pages of
documents for the report.
Senator Hank Brown, the Republican who was joint author of the report, said
it was a powerful example 'of the way governments around the world sometimes
don't work'.
Mr Brown said that in the US BCCI had 'circumvented our banking system,
slipped past our federal law enforcement system, facilitated drug
trafficking and attempted to use the revolving door of Washington politics
to escape capture'.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Detroit feels whip hand of the Lopez revolution: The man who
is forcing General Motors' suppliers to shape up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Listen to the cries of anguish echoing around Detroit these days and you
might conclude that Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is a latter-day Spanish
inquisitor.
After only four months in charge of worldwide purchasing at General Motors,
Mr Lopez, who hails from Spain's Basque country, has managed to fill a
sizeable proportion of the US car group's parts suppliers with fear,
trepidation and anger.
The cause: a drive to cut costs through a radical shake-up in the way the
group organises its parts purchases in North America and its links with
suppliers. This involves methods tested by Mr Lopez during the 1980s at
once-ailing GM Europe, which has become one of the world's most profitable
car manufacturers.
Tall, slim and 51 years old, Mr Lopez has a charming, informal manner that
belies his axeman reputation.
Supporters say Mr Lopez is implementing a long-overdue shake-up of GM's ties
with suppliers. But some parts makers have accused him of undermining their
relationship with GM by putting contracts up for renegotiation and demanding
unrealistic improvements in what they argue are good productivity records
and thin profit margins.
There are few more pips left to squeak, they say, after a parts industry
rationalisation in the 1980s which cost 100,000 jobs.
Not so, replies Mr Lopez. At a press briefing this week he answered his
critics for the first time and declared that:
Many US parts manufacturers are less competitive than those in Europe and
are capable of huge productivity improvements;
GM is trying to form a new, closer partnership with its best suppliers,
including advising them on efficiency and offering long-term contracts;
The company has never said it intends to break existing contracts and has no
intention of doing so, although it wants to prod suppliers into efficiency
gains that feed into price cuts.
The outcome of the Lopez revolution could have widespread repercussions. His
attempt to clamp down on GM's costs forms a crucial part of the group's
struggle to return its core North American car business to profit. This is
why he was plucked last May from his position as head of European
purchasing, following a coup by GM board members unhappy over slow progress
in turning US operations around.
GM obtains 70 per cent of parts from its subsidiaries, which will now have
to raise efficiency and compete with outside suppliers. This could mean job
cuts, prompting further clashes with the United Auto Workers' union.
Practical effects for GM's purchasing policy have been twofold. First, the
company has changed the structure of its parts-buying bureaucracy. It
previously ran a decentralised system under which parts for North American
plants were bought by more than two dozen units. Now contracts are put out
to global tender and have to be approved by Mr Lopez's team.
Second, Mr Lopez says GM is 'concentrating our efforts on selecting
suppliers who put the customer first . . . in terms of quality, service and
price'. And it is doing so through a process with the brain-numbing title of
Purchased Input Concept Optimisation with Suppliers, or Picos.
Picos means working with suppliers to improve relations, for example by
reaching agreements on contracts years before a car is brought into
production.
But its most dramatic manifestation has been GM's intervention in
manufacturing processes. Mr Lopez says this involves GM drawing up global
benchmarks of price and performance. It then contacts those among its
suppliers that are not among the best worldwide and offers to help them
improve.
Those that accept find themselves put through an intensive week-long study
of working methods by members of Mr Lopez's 200-strong Picos team.
In four months his team has conducted 101 US workshops These, he says, have
yielded an average productivity improvement of 65 per cent, with a 52 per
cent cut in material in process and a 35 per cent cut in floor space.
He presents Detroit-based General Safety, a manufacturer of seat belts, as
one convert to the Picos system. Mr Al Fisher, its president, confirms that
the company has enjoyed a 30 per cent productivity rise in areas converted
from assembly line system to cell structure after suggestions from GM.
'It has improved our profitability and competitiveness,' he declares.
For suppliers that work to meet its new standards, GM says it is prepared to
offer the security of long-term contracts, covering the life of a vehicle,
rather than contracts of one or two years.
However, the future looks grim for manufacturers not prepared to accept GM's
criticisms and help. GM may not cancel existing contracts, but will not sign
new ones with suppliers that fail to toe the line.
Motor industry Cassandras say the new policy will mean a big cut in the
number of GM suppliers, with smaller, less efficient manufacturers falling
by the wayside. But Mr Lopez says that in Europe GM's supplier base has been
little changed by Picos, while so far in the US 'we have not lost 100 per
cent of a single supplier'.
Parts makers may moan privately, but none can afford to offend a company
that buys Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17bn) of parts a year in North America alone.
The Spaniard may be an inquisitor, but he is also their hope for salvation.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Ratners shareholders voice discontent as losses deepen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD Ratner had a rough ride at the UK jewellery company's annual
meeting yesterday as several angry shareholders criticised his high pay and
demanded his resignation.
But the once-voluble Mr Ratner remained silent throughout the proceedings,
leaving it to the new chairman, Mr James McAdam, to quell the discontent and
defend the chief executive's reputation.
Ratners, which claims to be the biggest jewellery group in the world, also
released its interim results yesterday which showed a steepening of pre-tax
losses from Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 30.6m for the six months to August 1.
The result was better than expected - especially considering the 19 per cent
fall in sales to Pounds 364.6m. One analyst described the extent of the
cost-cutting and margin improvement as 'amazing in the circumstances'
although representing an 'appalling indictment of past management
practices'.
There was an ugly mood at the annual meeting as small shareholders sought
the reasons for the collapse of the company's fortunes and share price over
the last year.
One shareholder suggested - to widespread applause - that Mr Ratner should
have waived his 'utterly obscene' pay of Pounds 574,452 last year until
profits had improved. Another repeatedly called for Mr Ratner's resignation.
Mr McAdam said the directors had indeed waived their pay for one month in
January adding that their remuneration had since been cut by about one-third
to bring it into line with comparable companies.
He blamed the recession for the depth of the company's difficulties. 'The
immediate priority of this board is to get the trading line back on course.
From that all else will flow,' he said. 'The issue of Gerald Ratner's
resignation is not on the table.'
The glum-looking Mr Ratner left the meeting surrounded by security guards.
The company yesterday refused to comment on its ability or intention to make
a Pounds 58.5m bond repayment, due on October 30, but analysts suggested it
would be a tight call. The company's borrowings next month are expected to
rise to about Pounds 370m as it stocks up for Christmas  - although it can
call on borrowing facilities of Pounds 500m.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Eurotunnel wins ruling on TML payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL yesterday won an important victory over contractors building the
Channel tunnel when independent arbitrators ruled that it did not have to
continue paying an extra Pounds 50m a month to the construction companies.
Contractors, however, will not have to repay the Pounds 200m of additional
progress payments already made by Eurotunnel, which stopped making payments
in August and will not resume payments.
Eurotunnel also confirmed that its bankers had granted a waiver allowing it
to continue to draw down funds for another two months even though it is in
technical breach of its loan covenants.
The rulings will ease the pressure on Eurotunnel, which is involved in a
dispute with construction companies over who should pay the extra cost of
the tunnel, which has risen since 1987 from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds
8bn. Negotiations to solve the dispute foundered over the summer.
Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's co-chairman, was said last night to be
delighted with the arbitrators' decision.
He was attempting to restart talks with Transmanche Link (TML), the
consortium of 10 contractors, on settling the overall cost dispute.
A banker to Eurotunnel said he thought the decision would 'speed up
resolution of the dispute . . . It will galvanise people into action.' The
banker said it would increase pressure on TML to drop its remaining
objections to a settlement.
The arbitration tribunal consists of three lawyers appointed under rules of
the International Chambers of Commerce. Eurotunnel had asked the ICC to set
aside a previous ruling by an independent disputes panel requiring it to
raise monthly progress payments to TML by Pounds 50m.
The original ruling in March by the disputes panel was made after companies
threatened to stop work on installing a cooling system in the tunnel unless
they received money to cover the cost.
TML said yesterday that it would 'continue to safeguard the interests of its
member companies by reserving its position on works outside its contractual
commitment'. Contractors, although disappointed by the Brussels ruling, said
the Pounds 200m payments already received meant they could continue working
until next year.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Sale of privatised debt delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government's plan to sell Pounds 1bn of debt owed it by privatised
companies has been delayed, though the government's advisers say they can
still complete the sale before the current financial year ends next April.
The disposal, part of the Treasury's plans to raise Pounds 8bn from
privatisations this year, had been due to proceed at the beginning of
October, when potential buyers were to register their interest.
However, Baring Brothers, which is advising the government, said it will not
invite buyers to come forward until it has had another 'two or three weeks'
to look into how the sale is handled.
Mr Simon Best, a Baring director, denied yesterday that the bank had hit
problems with the sale, or that it might completely revise the way the
disposal is handled. The extra time would allow Baring to look at possible
refinements to its plans, he said.
Baring said in August that it would hold two auctions, one for debt of BT
and one for the electricity companies. To stimulate competitive bids, only
the best Pounds 1bn of bids for the total debt, which has a current value of
around Pounds 4bn, will be accepted.
Electricity companies are the only ones allowed to bid for their own debt,
while BT will bid alongside third parties for its Pounds 1.69bn of debt
outstanding.
The main tax problem in the way of the privatised companies buying back
their own debt has already been resolved. The Treasury has agreed to allow
them to bid at a lower level, reflecting the fact that they will not be able
to claim any tax losses from buying back and cancelling debt which is
trading at a premium.
However, Baring is now considering refinements to the tax position. One
possibility would involve the debt being sold to specially-created companies
run by the privatised companies, allowing the debt to remain until its
normal maturity date and so getting around the tax problems of early
repayment.
Further complications have yet to be resolved on the accounting side. For
instance, the premium paid by companies which buy back their debt is likely
to be treated as a current expense in their accounts, reducing their
profits. A company which borrowed to refinance the debt, could get around
this accounting problem.

FT  01 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow becalmed ahead of
September jobs report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
APART from some end-of-quarter 'window-dressing' by institutional investors,
US stockmarkets were becalmed yesterday as investors anxiously awaited
tomorrow's vital employment report for September, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 4.86 at 3,271.66,
having spent the entire day no more than 10 points either side of Tuesday's
close. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finished slightly firmer,
up 1.00 at 417.80, and the Amex composite rose 1.11 to 376.72. The Nasdaq
composite was the day's best performer, rising 5.64 to 583.27. Turnover on
the NYSE was 185m shares.
September's employment figures, due out tomorrow morning, dominated trading.
Investors and analysts are unsure whether a particularly bad jobs report
will provoke the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates once more, to
stimulate the sluggish economy.
Analysts say that prices did not move up in anticipation of a policy ease
this week, for two reasons: investors were not confident that the Fed would
ease if the numbers were bad; and even if the report showed further
deterioration in labour market conditions, expectations of economic growth
and corporate earnings for the rest of the year would have to be revised
downward quickly.
The day's economic news had little impact on sentiment. The Chicago
purchasers' index for September rose slightly, but new home sales showed a
sharper-than-expected decline of 6.1 per cent in August.
Among individual stocks, Times Mirror fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 30 1/2
after Smith Barney, the broking house, downgraded the stock to a 'hold' from
a 'buy', citing continued weakness in the Los Angeles area economy. On
Tuesday the company warned that August advertising revenues fell by 5.6 per
cent from a year ago.
Another stock hit by a Smith Barney downgrade was Morgan Stanley, the
securities house, which fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 after Ms Alison
Deans, the Smith Barney analyst, lowered her fiscal year 1993 forecasts for
Morgan Stanley because of lower international business.
Computervision fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 in turnover of almost 3m
shares after the company warned that third-quarter operating profits will be
lower than a year ago, adversely affecting full-year 1992 results.
On the Nasdaq market, Gensia Pharmaceutical fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 20
1/2 on news that shareholders are suing the company for alleged securities
law violations relating to the testing of its Arasine drug. Canada
TORONTO stocks continued downwards as the main Canadian banks raised prime
rates by two points to 8.25%.
The TSE 300 composite index dropped 29.36 to 3,297.88 in volume of 30.35m
shares worth CDollars 363.2m. Investors fear the trend will continue if the
Canadian dollar keeps falling.

FT  01 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazil sober after Tuesday vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) index responded soberly to Tuesday's
vote for impeachment proceedings against President Fernando Collor de Mello,
writes Bill Hinchberger. The Bovespa index fell 822, or 1.8 per cent, to
44,494 after Tuesday's anticipatory 7.7 per cent gain. Turnover was about
Dollars 88m.
Traders said that the reaction partly reflected profit-taking. Analysts also
believe that the market is waiting for the interim president, vice-president
Itamar Franco, to determine his economic team.
'Until the new finance minister is named, everyone is waiting to see which
policies will be adopted,' said Mr Roberto Serwaczak, research director with
the local branch of Baring Securities.
Some investors are worried that Mr Franco's nationalist reputation will be
reflected in a slow down of the modernisation scheme started under Mr
Collor. But they add that improved relations between the executive and
legislative branches could help bring about much needed fiscal reform.

<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average fell for the fourth consecutive day on the lack of window
dressing for the September interim book-closing, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The index shed 349.01 to 17,399.08, having seen the day's high of 17,909.71
in the morning session on buying by investment trusts, before extending its
losing streak on late selling, and falling to the day's low of 17,398.98
just before the close.
Volume remained thin at 260m shares against 231m. Losers led gainers by 693
to 243, with 161 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell
21.12 to 1,310.60 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.85 to
1040.91.
Buying by public postal insurance funds, and other public funds, advocated
by the government's emergency fiscal package in August, was seen yesterday.
However, this buying remained light.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that daily average trading volume and
turnover grew to a year's high in September. Daily volume averaged some 390m
shares, the largest since the same time last year when volume was 482m
shares. Daily turnover averaged Y342bn, the biggest since Y430bn in October
1991.
High-technology issues declined on worries over the higher yen. The currency
closed at Y119.25 against the dollar, a new all-time high. NEC fell Y16 to
Y697 and Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y40 to Y1,070. Banks were lower
on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y130 to Y2,440 and
Mitsubishi Bank fell Y130 to Y2,020.
Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the most active issue of the day, rose Y12 to Y510
on speculative trading. Aisin Seiki, a car parts maker, rose Y85 to Y980 on
rumours of a successful nuclear fusion experiment.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 134.12 to 19,017.60 in volume of 25.5m
shares.
Roundup
SENTIMENT was mixed in the region yesterday.
HONG KONG closed weaker for the third consecutive day, the Hang Seng index
losing 74.48 to 5,505.44, 3.2 per cent below last Friday's close. Turnover
rose from HKDollars 1.78bn to HKDollars 2.00bn and brokers said that all
sectors came under selling pressure except for banks and utilities.
AUSTRALIA saw trade swollen by an ADollars 55m portfolio put through by BZW,
but anticipated gyrations on futures failed to materialise and the All
Ordinaries index closed 2.7 down at 1485.0.
BANGKOK fell as investors worried about a meeting between Stock Exchange of
Thailand officials and brokers to discuss price manipulation. The SET index
closed 3.52 lower at 847.00 in turnover of Bt10.74bn.
TAIWAN closed sharply higher after technical buying of blue chips by
institutional investors and brokerages helped to improve sentiment. The
weighted index rose 126.92, or 3.7 per cent, to 3,524.21 in turnover of
TDollars 15.7bn against TDollars 10.8bn.
MANILA rose in active trade for the second day in a row, the composite index
ending 9.18 higher at 1,404.54 as blue chips, led by the telephone stock
PLDT and oil issues, lifted the market.
Brokers said that bullish sentiment was partly due to reports that the
authorities had broken a syndicate linked to kidnappings in the capital.
BOMBAY took a cue from the state-owned mutual fund, Unit Trust of India,
which started buying on Tuesday, and the BSE index rose 98.67 to 3,294.42.

FT  01 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Late rally ends dismal month in Sweden
 -A rates cut boost to equities hit from home and abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish stock market rallied 6.5 per cent yesterday after a reduction in
domestic interest rates and an announcement of new measures to improve the
country's industrial competitiveness.
The rise, which saw the Affarsvarlden general index close up 42.5 at 696.6,
was a welcome boost for a market which has had its worst year since the
1930s.
Until yesterday, the index had fallen 28 per cent since the start of the
year, and 35 per cent since its peak in May. September was a particularly
dismal month because of financial turbulence in Europe and soaring interest
rates at home.
All sectors have been down. By far the worst performers have been the
bank/finance and real estate/construction sectors, both of which had
declined more than 70 per cent since the start of the year before
yesterday's rally. Since September 8, when interest rates were first pushed
up sharply after the effective devaluation of the Finnish markka, the bank
sector had fallen by 30 per cent. Yesterday the sector improved by more than
12 per cent.
Crisis measures to reduce the growing budget deficit, announced by the
minority centre-right government and opposition Social Democrats on
September 20, have done nothing to improve confidence. The market remains
preoccupied by international and domestic concerns.
The single most depressing influence is the level of the central bank's
marginal overnight lending rate which looks set to remain at high levels for
some time. The rate climbed as high as 500 per cent last month as part of a
determined (and so far successful) government effort to stave off
devaluation.
Yesterday it was reduced to 24 per cent from 40 per cent after a series of
new measures to calm the markets was announced. One important effect of such
high rates has been to make high-yielding fixed-rate securities seem much
more attractive and less risky than equity investments.
In recent days, the glum mood has been exacerbated by pessimism about when
the domestic business cycle will turn up. Two of the leading banks, Svenska
Handelsbanken and S-E Banken, have predicted that Swedish gross national
product will fall again in 1993, making it the third consecutive year of
decline. The corporate sector has also been making gloomier predictions
about the earnings outlook. 'There is increasing concern about the overall
business cycle, and worries that 1993 is going to be a tougher year than
companies and investors had been expecting,' says Mr Johan Strandberg, an
analyst with the Stockholm-based Haeggloef and Ponsbach securities house.
There was still no sign of an upturn in either banking or construction until
yesterday. The government has promised to put a safety net under the banking
sector, although details are not yet clear. Meanwhile, the market is taking
its cue from developments in the financial arena, such as the bankruptcy of
the Swedish holding company Gota, the owner of Gota Bank.
A market revival might be more in prospect if international events were more
encouraging. But sluggish economic growth, high interest rates in Germany,
problems in other Scandanavian economies and volatile currency markets have
not helped. mood.
Given this uncertainty both at home and abroad, few analysts will make firm
predictions about where the market is heading. At the same time, the outside
world is still a little hesitant about the tenacity of Sweden in pursuing
its current economy policy and worries about a possible devaluation have not
subsided completely.
Although there is a broad political consensus behind the measures the
government is taking to restore confidence in the krona, many will want to
see them implemented, and interest rates down, before they are confident
enough to become significant buyers of equities again.

FT  01 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris financials consider
recovery potential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
END-of-quarter operations moved bourses, and individual shares yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was driven by technical factors throughout the day as the September
options expired. In the last hour, the start of October futures pulled up
the CAC-40 index, which closed 4.80 better at 1,736.73 in turnover of
FFr3.8bn.
Arbitrage-related activity affected the performance of most stocks while the
financial sector was affected further by disappointing first half results as
Suez, down FFr3.30 at FFr236.20, and Paribas, eventually FFr9.20 higher at
FFr322.50, both said that they would have to make large provisions against
exposure to the property sector.
The Suez and Paribas warnings are only the latest in a series, following an
increase in commercial property vacancy rates. However, Mr William Vincent,
European banking analyst at Nomura, commented that the provisions were
likely to peak in 1992, assuming that the economic climate did not
deteriorate, which would lead to a good year for earnings in 1993.
In the case of Compagnie Bancaire (up FFr15 at FFr350), which also reported
interims recently, he noted that 'next year the combination of continued
steady revenue growth, strict cost control and a fairly modest fall in
provisions will result in a sharp recovery.'
Other active issues of the day included Peugeot, up FFr15 at FFr540, and
BSN, down FFr9 at FFr989 as an extraordinary general meeting approved limits
on voting rights.
FRANKFURT surrendered early gains on gloomy economic data, earnings
downgrades and foreign selling. The DAX index, up 12 points at the outset,
dropped 9.90 to a new 1992 closing low of 1,466.36.
Turnover rose to DM4.8bn from DM4.2bn. A German inflation figure of 3.6 per
cent for September snuffed out any lingering interest rate hopes; in
addition, the federation of German retailers said that west German retail
sales dropped by 3.1 per cent during the first seven months of this year.
At County NatWest, Mr Adrian Hopkinson noted that German holiday bookings
abroad were up 20 per cent this summer, and that consumption was unlikely to
flow in two directions at the same time. Shares in the sector fell in
tandem, with Kaufhof down DM8 to DM412 and Karstadt by DM9 to DM478.
Carmakers continued their downtrend on the weak dollar and the truckbuilder,
MAN, dropped DM9.50 to DM250. County, starting from a conservative base has
recently dropped its 1993 eps forecast for MAN from DM26 to DM22.
Meanwhile, in utilities, an apparently defensive sector, Bayernhypo put out
deeper downgrades for RWE and Veba, which fell DM6 to DM376.50, and DM4.50
to DM356.50 respectively.
ZURICH, mixed as the weak dollar dampened sentiment, saw the SMI index shed
1.9 to 1,878.3. The consumer electronics group, Interdiscount, topped the
active list and ranged between SFr1,500 and SFr1,640, on apparently
conflicting bets on today's annual news conference, before closing SFr20
higher at SFr1,600.
MILAN, once again, tasted the bitter-sweet fruits of devaluation. The Comit
index rose 4,82, or 1.3 per cent to 363.64 but the Italian component of the
FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, expressed in D-Mark terms, fell by 24.71, or 3.9
per cent to 604.43.
BRUSSELS reflected late arbitrage activity in Electrabel, between ordinary
and tax-efficient Afv stock which rose 0.1 per cent, and 1.7 per cent (for
the Afv 1) to BFr4,790 as the Bel-20 index closed just 1.97 higher at
1,109.17.
However, there were more steel industry problems as Cockerill dropped 4.5
per cent to BFr128 in active trade. The industry leader reported a 58 per
cent drop in profits after the market closed.
AMSTERDAM resisted steep falls as the CBS Tendency index closed 0.1 down at
110.9. Philips lost 70 cents to Fl 22.70 while Polygram was 20 cents lower
at Fl 47.00. James Capel downgraded the Polygram stock yesterday to
short-term sell from hold, expecting profits growth to slow down further
over the second half.
COPENHAGEN saw Baltica rise DKr26 to DKr215, writes Hilary Barnes, following
statements by the chief executive officer, Mr Peter Christoffersen, to local
newspapers explaining why, in his view, the insurance group's problems
cannot end in the same kind of free-fall that wiped out Hafnia. The KFX
index of most-traded shares rose 0.84 to 73.61.
VIENNA lost 2 per cent in low volume, on selling pressure from the futures
and options exchange. The ATX index closed 16.90 lower at 795.56.
TEL AVIV closed at a new high in active trading. The index rose 2.15 or 1.28
per cent to 170.23 in turnover of Skl101m.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Major wins support on resisting two-speed EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR ended the first round of a diplomatic offensive in Europe last
night with assurances from his counterparts in France, Germany and Denmark
that they would not seek to push Britain into the slow lane of a two-speed
Europe.
But during meetings in Paris and London with the French and Danish leaders
and a lengthy telephone conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the prime
minister admitted that he could not ratify the Maastricht treaty until next
year.
Mr Major appeared to have made little headway with his demands that the
emergency summit of EC leaders later this month in Birmingham should
initiate a fundamental overhaul of the workings of the European exchange
rate mechanism.
The other leaders accept that the wave of speculative activity which forced
sterling and the lira out of the ERM merit a review of the system but do not
accept the British view that there are 'fault lines' in the ERM.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, also created fresh confusion
with a suggestion in an interview in a German newspaper that European
countries with stable economies and currencies could make up a joint
currency zone that would be the nucleus of a future Europe.
He said in an interview with the Nordkurier newspaper that he would not
describe this as a two-speed development, but rather a Europe of concentric
circles.
In Paris, Mr Major and French president Francois Mitterrand agreed on the
need for EC states to advance 'as Twelve' to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Major said Mr Mitterrand showed 'no impatience, but a lot of
understanding and agreement' with him on the difficulty of pushing the
Maastricht treaty on European union rapidly through a divided UK parliament.
A joint statement issued by the two leaders indicated that Mr Mitterrand is,
for the moment, more anxious to help than to pressure Mr Major on the
treaty's ratification.
The two leaders 'stressed the importance of the Community developing as
Twelve and respecting the interests of each member state', the statement
said. 'In this context, they looked forward to the ratification and entry
into force of the Maastricht treaty.'
The absence of any mention of timing on ratification will be helpful to Mr
Major, as well as to his Downing Street dinner guest last night, Mr Poul
Schluter, the Danish prime minister.
Mr Schluter called for a 'new basis' for the Maastricht treaty as a
condition for a fresh referendum in Denmark next year. He said he saw
'common ground' with other EC countries on the need for more openness and
less bureaucracy in EC decision-making.
After assurances from Mr Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl that France and
Germany were not hatching a fast-track move to a restricted economic and
monetary union, excluding the UK and other weaker EC economies, Mr Major
said: 'I don't think any of us want to see what is loosely called a
two-speed Europe.'
Later after his dinner with Mr Schluter, Mr Major added: 'We are gradually
beginning to piece together the way in which we might move forward from the
present difficulties.'
He said there was some way to go before the government brought back to the
House of Commons the bill to ratify the Maastricht. But he added that it
need not be delayed until a second Danish referendum.

THE LIRA and sterling came under renewed pressure against the D-Mark
yesterday as tensions continued to dominate currency trading in and out of
the ERM.
The lira, which was suspended from the ERM two weeks ago, suffered a 5.8 per
cent fall against the D-Mark after investors became increasingly concerned
that the Bank of Italy would reintroduce exchange controls. The widespread
rumour that Italy was planning a partial freeze on bank accounts was
repeatedly denied by the Italian government and the Bank of Italy. This
could not stop the lira falling to a low of L900 from a previous close in
Europe of L847.6. It recovered to close in London at L876, while in New York
it finished at L867.35.
Markets remain concerned that Italy's emergency budget may have a difficult
passage through parliament.
The lira's difficulties triggered another fall for sterling, which touched a
historic low of DM2.50. Investors recalled that the last big run on the lira
was followed a day later by sterling's devaluation. The pound rallied to
close in London at DM2.5175, down  1/4 of a pfennig. In New York it closed
at DM2.5165.
Sterling's weakness was partly compounded by another fall in the dollar
against the D-Mark. Investors are increasingly concerned that the US
non-farm payroll figure for August, due out tomorrow, will be very weak.
The figure may trigger another cut in the US discount rate, widening the
differential between US and German interest rates. The dollar closed in
Europe at DM1.4135, after a low of DM1.4040. In New York it closed at
DM1.4113.
The D-Mark's renewed strength created another rise of tensions inside the
ERM, with the peseta and franc weakening.

FT  01 OCT 92 / New Anglo-German ERM row: Treasury angered by leaked report
of Bundesbank's defence over Black Wednesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN AND Germany were last night embroiled in an extraordinary diplomatic
row after an apparent attempt by the Bundesbank to set the record straight
over its role in sterling's devaluation misfired.
A statement by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, which was
made available to the Financial Times through the German embassy in London,
brought relations between the UK Treasury and the German central bank to a
new low.
In his statement, Mr Schlesinger insisted he had not undermined sterling in
the controversial interview he gave to Handelsblatt, the German business
daily, the day before Black Wednesday when the pound was forced to quit the
European exchange rate mechanism.
He also:
Rebutted UK suggestions that the Bundesbank had failed to give sterling
sufficient support in foreign exchange market operations before it floated.
Revealed that the Bundesbank had spent DM44bn (Pounds 17.3bn) on defending
the pound and lira and that most of that had gone to support sterling.
Denied that the Bundesbank had favoured the French franc over the pound
during the recent turmoil on the currency markets.
Insisted the Bundesbank could not be blamed for what it described as
anonymous statements and rumours in the markets and inaccurate reproduction
of the central bank's statements by newspapers.
The disclosures prompted a sharp response from the UK Treasury. In a
statement to which Mr John Major, the prime minister, later attached his
name, the Treasury attacked the German disclosures as a breach of
confidential communications between the German and UK governments.
The statement said Mr Schlesinger's remarks about the interview 'misses the
point'. It accused the German embassy in London of having issued on behalf
of the Bundesbank 'an almost complete version' of a confidential paper which
the German ambassador had delivered to the Foreign Office on Monday.
The Bank of England said it did 'not entirely recognise' the German version
of events leading to the sterling crisis as set out in the four-page
document from the Bundesbank, the release of which it 'very much regretted'.
Contacted in Frankfurt last night, Mr Schlesinger appeared dismayed by the
latest events. The Bundesbank had hoped to clear the air, he said. 'We have
a right and a duty to make our standpoint clear.' Despite the
intensification of the Anglo-German row, he said he hoped 'all sides could
return to orderly and business-like relationships'.
The abrupt escalation in the row over events surrounding sterling's
withdrawal from the ERM brought to a head an increasingly bitter dispute
between the UK Treasury and the Bundesbank. It began when the German embassy
in London contacted the Financial Times yesterday to offer a statement from
the Bundesbank in which Mr Schlesinger put his side of the sterling
devaluation story. The statement had been supplied to the embassy by the
German central bank and the embassy said it was given discretion on its
distribution.
The statement's authenticity was checked with the Bundesbank in Frankfurt.
With the knowledge of the German embassy, the UK Treasury and the Bank of
England were contacted for their comments.
In his statement, entitled 'Comments by Bundesbank President Prof. Dr Helmut
Schlesinger on reproaches made by some members of the British government',
Mr Schlesinger said he had 'expressly excluded the UK currency from being
endangered' in his interview with Handelsblatt. He quoted at length sections
of the interview as it appeared in the German newspaper on September 17.
The Treasury said the problems for sterling arose not from reports published
on September 17, but from what had been published on September 16 and in
early reports of Mr Schlesinger's interview which had begun to circulate on
the evening of September 15. Among remarks attributed to Mr Schlesinger was
the statement that 'the situation in the EMS could have been further eased
if there had been a more comprehensive realignment'.
The UK Treasury said that 'against a history of reports emanating from the
Bundesbank, this was inevitably interpreted as a reference to sterling'.
Mr Schlesinger's statement detailed the scale of the Bundesbank support for
sterling. He said it had intervened before sterling hit its ERM floor, which
had not been required under ERM rules and that D-Mark sales financed by the
Bundesbank when the pound hit its floor were 'the largest compulsory
interventions ever' for a partner currency.
The 'greater part' of the DM44bn of compulsory D-Mark sales during the week
of the sterling crisis were for sterling, he added. Bundesbank officials
indicated the sum involved was more than DM25bn.
The Bundesbank chief said the high level of support for sterling 'was
primarily due to the fact that the UK monetary authorities seem to have been
prepared to allow sterling to fall to its lower intervention point. The
Banque de France, by contrast, concentrated on keeping the franc rate above
its intervention point . . .'
However, this evidence of German support for the pound cut little ice with
the UK Treasury, which said: 'The UK government has never claimed that the
Bundesbank did not comply with its technical obligations under the ERM. We
have simply noted the very public way in which statements of support for the
(French) franc were made, in contrast to the undermining statements made in
relation to sterling.'
The Treasury's rebuttal also insisted that the German government never
suggested a broader realignment of the ERM on the weekend of September 11/12
shortly before the Italian lira was devalued within the system.
Last night, the German embassy said yesterday's statement was different from
that given by Baron Hermann Von Richthofen, the German ambassador to London,
to Sir David Gilmore, permanent under secretary at the Foreign Office.
Philip Stephens writes: As well as prompting an angry response from Mr
Major, the row between the Bundesbank and the Treasury raised new questions
among ministerial colleagues about Mr Norman Lamont's long-term future as
chancellor.
After a day of painstaking attempts to rebuild bridges with Britain's
European partners, the prime minister at first declined last night to
comment directly on Mr Schlesinger's comments.
Speaking after a meeting with Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister,
Mr Major said he had not seen the note sent to the Foreign Office: 'When I
have seen it I will comment on it'.
But within minutes, the Treasury indicated that Mr Major had attached his
name - and that of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - to the
government's detailed rebuttal of the Bundesbank president's charges.
The public clashes prompted dismay among other ministers and raised
questions among some about Mr Lamont's handling of the issue. The Foreign
Office, anxious to mend fences with Bonn, will see the latest dispute as a
significant setback.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN, the New York banking group, boycotted a creditors' meeting called
by Olympia &amp; York yesterday in protest against what the bank views as
totally inadequate proposals for restructuring the troubled property
developer's US debt.
Morgan's unhappiness with O&amp;Y's proposals is balanced, however, by its
willingness to put off for at least another month plans to seize an
interest-rate swap pledged as partial collateral on a USDollars 160m loan to
O&amp;Y.
The restructuring plan is designed to keep O&amp;Y's US operations out of the
bankruptcy protection sought last May for the parent company and its
Canadian subsidiaries, and for the Canary Wharf project in London.
O&amp;Y asked about 75 creditors who did attend the meeting in New York to defer
principal payments for about five years. It hopes to reach a comprehensive
agreement by the end of this year for a 'consensual long-term restructuring'
of the US debt.
Banking sources said that Morgan views the proposals as a 'complete
non-starter'. Morgan is the co-lead manager of the syndicate which advanced
the Dollars 160m loan. It has moved on several fronts in recent months to
secure its interests, including a threat to auction the swap and a demand
that it have greater control over the cash flow of several buildings also
pledged as security for the loan.
A JP Morgan spokesman said yesterday that 'constructive talks' were
continuing with O&amp;Y on the swap. The deadline for seizure has been extended
until October 29, at the earliest.
O&amp;Y's US subsidiary said its restructuring plan would enable it to maintain
its franchise as an owner and manager of properties concentrated in New York
City.

ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group,
yesterday reported a 20 per cent rise in first-half net profits, mainly due
to exceptional gains, and forecast higher earnings for the year as a whole.
Net income climbed to FFr3.1bn (Dollars 615m) in the first six months of
this year, from FFr2.6bn in the same period of 1991, on sales up by 6 per
cent to FFr79.47bn. Most of the rise in net income was due to a FFr437m
capital gain on the sale of Treasury stock. Operating profits fell by 3 per
cent to FFr6.34bn.
On average, Alcatel Alsthom's subsidiaries produced a 5 per cent net return
on turnover, the company said.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 8 per cent over the period to
FFr24.70.

CHEVRON, one of the biggest US oil and gas groups, yesterday said it
expected to record a fourth-quarter extraordinary gain of Dollars 375m
following settlement of its litigation with Pennzoil.
Under the agreement, Pennzoil will acquire a group of Chevron's US oil and
gas fields in a tax-free exchange of stock.
The deal will reduce Pennzoil's stake in Chevron to about 5.3 per cent, or
about 17.2m shares, from about 9.7 per cent.
Chevron's litigation with Pennzoil started in 1989, when Pennzoil's stake in
Chevron reached 9 per cent.
Once the deal is completed, both companies will drop all legal claims
against each other stemming from Pennzoil's 1989 investment.
In addition, both companies have agreed not to purchase additional shares of
each other's stock for five years.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Two companies' unusual approach to goodwill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO QUOTED companies have adopted an unusual approach to new accounting
standards, according to Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly
monitoring service of annual accounts.
Enterprise Computer Holdings, the computing services company, and West
Trust, the fabrics manufacturer, have both been required to alter their
treatment of goodwill under a ruling issued last December by the urgent
issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board.
The ruling requires companies to reflect in their profit and loss account on
disposal any goodwill at the time of acquisition. Goodwill is the difference
between the net assets and the purchase price paid.
Both West Trust and Enterprise Computer include this goodwill element, but
split it between an adjustment of goodwill and a surplus or loss on sale and
closure of subsidiaries. They do not refer elsewhere in the accounts to the
full loss including goodwill.
West Trust shows a Pounds 2.3m goodwill item and a separate Pounds 480,000
loss on the sale of a subsidiary in its accounts for the year to March 31.
Enterprise Computer shows a Pounds 1.1m surplus on sale and a Pounds 23.1m
goodwill write-off as extraordinary items, and then reinstates the Pounds
23.1m below the line before showing a transfer from the profit and loss
account of Pounds 7m.
Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman of Enterprise Computer, says the company showed a
Pounds 1.1m surplus because it still held shares in the company it sold, and
separated out the two items because 'otherwise shareholders would have had a
heart attack to see the loss for the year without realising that no cash
went out.'

FT  01 OCT 92 / Technology: Double vision - The latest developments in
consumer photography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The photographic industry is suffering from double vision. It is grappling
with a move into electronics while experimenting with lighter cameras and
'intelligent' film. As a result, it is having to think big and small at the
same time. This has prompted manufacturers to head off in various
technological directions.
The long-awaited move into the electronic era is its biggest challenge. For
years, manufacturers have been trumpeting the approach of an age when 'the
photograph meets the computer meets the video in one medium,' as Jonathan
Brandon, marketing co-ordinator at Canon in the UK puts it. But the industry
has not yet been able to deliver the goods.
While digital still video cameras - which record images on magnetic disks
and then 'play' them back on television - have been available for a number
of years, they are still mainly for specialist use and are not expected to
win mass consumer acceptance for some time.
The greatest advantage of digital still videos is that there is no need for
film processing. The pictures which are shot can be viewed immediately on
television. And images captured on a digital camera can be sent down the
telephone line to an electronic device such as a computer.
The business potential is huge. Newspapers and other publications are
already using digital cameras to send pictures of major events half way
around the globe in a matter of seconds.
The average consumer, however, has not yet warmed to the idea of electronic
photography, whatever its merits. For one thing, digital photography cannot
yet match the price advantages of chemical film processing. Kodak's latest
fully digital cameras cost Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 6,500.
Digital cameras also fail to compete successfully on quality grounds. When
viewed on an electronic medium such as television the resolution is
excellent, but it lacks the quality of a Polaroid when printed.
This is because the amount of digital data needed to obtain the equivalent
of a single frame of high-quality film would fill 20 floppy disks, Kodak
says. What can be stored on a digital camera disk is a fraction of that.
As Leo Thomas, group vice president of Kodak, told an audience at the recent
Photokina photography exhibition in Cologne: 'As long as you can get
excellent colour prints from traditional systems at less than 1 per cent the
cost of (digital cameras), silver halide systems will take most of our
pictures.'
Nevertheless, manufacturers insist that demand for digital photography is
growing. 'By the year 2010 the average person would not be using
emulsion-based film cameras,' predicts Brandon. 'It will be totally
electronically based.'
The camera of the future will have a 'smart card' instead of a roll of film.
People will simply insert the card into their televisions to view the
photographs.
But even for those who are more muted in their enthusiasm about the digital
age of photography, such as Kodak, the question is no longer whether the age
of digitisation will come but when.
Despite its own vested interests in chemical photography, Kodak recently
launched its own electronic storage system, called Photo-CD. 'We felt that
if Kodak didn't supply the electronic system to photography, the computer
industry would,' says Scott Brownstein at Kodak.
Photo-CD attempts to combine the best of both the chemical and digital
worlds by transferring photographs taken by conventional cameras on to
digital disks. Because silver halide film is used in taking the photographs,
quality is not sacrificed. The benefits of digitisation are there too, in
the form of compact storage on a CD-sized disk and the ability to manipulate
and transfer the images via electronic media.
d3 The increasing popularity of camcorders has prompted the question of
whether the 35mm compact camera and its more sophisticated cousin, the
single lens reflex camera (SLR), can survive amid intense competition. So
far, they are not giving up without a fight.
SLR cameras are undergoing improvements such as eye-controlled focusing,
which enables the camera to detect what the photographer's eye is looking at
by analysing light reflected from it. Other tricks include a mechanism to
minimise the 'red eye' effect and a 'silent' mode to reduce the noise
created by automatic zoom lenses and automatic film rewinding.
Yet for the majority of amateur photographers who want a small, simple box
that can be relied upon to take good pictures, this gimmickry seems to
defeat the purpose of a compact camera, which is primarily ease of use.
So it will come as no surprise that the compact camera market is seeing a
revival in simple, 'decision free' cameras that are light, cheap, and simple
to use.
Over the past 10 years, cameras have become smaller but they also become
more complex, as manufacturers add an increasing number of features such as
zoom lenses, explains Jonathan Brandon, marketing co-ordinator of Canon in
the UK. The more features they add, the larger the cameras got again. 'Now,
we're seeing a regression to simpler cameras,' he says.
Single-use cameras, often referred to as 'disposable' cameras, have
doubtless taken market share away from compacts. But with lightweight
compact cameras that take good-quality pictures selling for as little as
Pounds 39, single-use cameras are still seen primarily for emergency use.
Canon says that while camcorders have eaten into sales of more expensive SLR
cameras, the company saw SLR sales rise strongly after it dropped prices.
'Everything robs from everything else,' says Brandon. 'Photography has
always been niche marketing.'
d3 Meanwhile, Kodak and Fuji, the US and Japanese film companies, have been
working with camera manufacturers Canon, Nikon and Minolta on film
technologies. The widespread view among industry watchers is that the
companies are working to reduce the size of the film canister so that
cameras can be made thinner.
The attempt to make the film canister smaller fits in with the trend to
reduce the overall size of the camera. Although progress has been made,
after a certain point reduction in the camera size is restricted by the size
of the film.
The technology is not a problem. 'We have the technology to make any film of
any size,' says Mike O'Farrell, manager of Kodak's consumer imaging
division. But the 135mm format most commonly used today offers excellent
reproduction on any print size. 'It would have to be something really
spectacularly good to challenge it,' O'Farrell says.
One way to keep the 135mm format but reduce the overall space taken up by
the film is to reduce the circumference of the canister. Konica, the
Japanese film and camera manufacturer, has succeeded in reducing the
diameter of the canister from the conventional 2.5cm to 2cm by making both
the film base and chemical coating thinner. Yet only one camera, Konica's
'single-use' device sold in Japan, is made to fit the film.
Another development in film technology is the use of magnetic strips on film
to record information about the conditions under which photographs were
shot, such as lighting and distance. This 'intelligent' film would improve
the printing process by giving developers more accurate information on how
each particular photograph should be printed.
The magnetic strip may even be able to replace the zoom lens. Information
could be recorded on the magnetic strip to print just one particular section
of the image, framed in the viewfinder, in an enlarged format. This
information could be fed into the printer at the time of printing.
The magnetic strip is still experimental, but closer collaboration between
camera manufacturers and film companies will help whatever strides are made
in film technology. In a fickle market, strategic alliances may be the only
way manufacturers can stay one step ahead of the competition.

FT  01 OCT 92 / People: BM finds Woolley Bristol-fashion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In choosing a new chairman, BM Group has gone for a completely different
animal from Roger Shute, the man who built it up from nothing in 1979 to an
international concern that will turn over about Pounds 600m this year.
Shute, 47, succumbed this summer to stress and respiratory illness,
aggravated by 60 cigarettes a day, as the stock market became increasingly
nervous about its profit outlook in the midst of a deepening recession.
For a start, the newcomer Moger Woolley, 57, is non-executive and will
shuffle his BM duties with the chairmanships of packaging companies API and
Dolphin, plus three other non-executive posts.
Woolley spent 30 years at DRG, ending up as chief executive of the packaging
group before it was taken over by Pembridge Investments in 1989. He then
spent a few months as chairman of Parkway before it was taken over by Wace,
and was also chairman of CHB, the housing wing that Beazer wanted to float,
before Beazer in turn fell to Hanson. Shute, on the other hand, had lots of
jobs before settling down as a construction equipment salesman and then
striking out into self-employment.
Coincidentally, Shute was backed by Beazer when he set up in business. But
that was long before Woolley's involvement in CHB and the link rather is
with Matthew Thorne, BM's temporary non-executive chairman, also ex-Beazer
and a friend of Woolley's on the Bristol scene.
Woolley plays cricket and, golf - badly of course - and talks of balance in
one's life. Shute frequently expressed contempt for executives spending time
on golf courses and once said: 'If you work 16 hours a day, seven days a
week, you do better than the slob who works five hours a day, three days a
week.' Now, however, having taken life a bit more easily, Shute's health has
improved, he has cut down on cigarettes and remains honorary president of
BM.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Technology: Spirits lifted in truck industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world lift truck industry does not have much to be happy about at
present, but Bruno Kulick, joint managing director of Lansing Linde, was
permitting himself a glimmer of a smile last week.
In the middle of a recession that has caused an estimated 40 per cent
contraction in the UK lift truck market over the past two years, and which
shows no real sign of easing, Kulick and his team at the German-owned
company lured 1,000 warehousing managers to Basingstoke to see some
important new products and look round the first stage of a Pounds 50m
manufacturing investment.
'Maybe it's just my hope, but the number of visitors might show that
something positive is happening,' he says.
The jamboree marked the latest stage in the transformation of the former
Lansing Bagnall, founded by Sir Emmanuel Kaye in the early 1940s, into the
UK arm of Linde, the world's largest lift truck group, which bought Lansing
in 1989.
The deal almost certainly saved Lansing from going under in the current
recession. The new Lansing Linde is being turned into Linde's global centre
for the manufacture of electric lift trucks used in warehouses - Linde
itself is better-known for internal combustion engine lift trucks normally
used outside the warehouse.
The centrepiece of last week's event was a new range of reach trucks, so
named because of their high reach, which are an essential feature of many
modern warehouses. The range will become the core product at Basingstoke,
accounting eventually for about 80 per cent of Lansing Linde's turnover,
says Kulick.
The launch is also important for Linde as a whole, because the purchase of a
reach truck often leads to orders from the same customer for related
equipment such as pallet trucks and order pickers, made elsewhere in the
group.
But the manufacturing methods and component purchasing policy illustrate how
things have changed from the old days at Lansing, which used to engineer
nearly all of the lift truck itself. Lansing Linde had overall control of
the new range, but handling hydraulics and electronics was a joint effort
with Linde.
The result is a product that is 60 per cent made in Basingstoke or from UK
components, and 40 per cent from foreign components - many of which are
common to all Linde lift trucks.
And a new flow-line system in the recently-completed assembly plant - which
represents one-third of the Pounds 50m investment programme - has reduced
the build time from three-four weeks to four-five days.
The investment in manufacturing is a timely move for Lansing Linde - and not
only because it ensures the future of the company within the German group.
According to Kulick, there has been a tremendous change in philosophy in the
UK lift truck market over the past three years, with customers shifting away
from outright purchase to leasing and other finance deals.
As customers increasingly concentrate on their core activities, that leaves
the lift truck manufacturers as the real owners of their products, and
forces them to consider the 'lifetime cost' of the machines. Fitting a
low-cost bearing, for example, might save on the manufacturing cost but
could ultimately be a false economy.
Kulick and the heads of other lift truck producers will be hoping that UK
warehouse managers will be more disposed to buy new equipment in the
not-too-distant future than over the past two years. Whether they do remains
to be seen, but at least the pound's devaluation has provided an ideal
springboard for Lansing Linde's export drive.

<TEXT>
WILSON Neill, the New Zealand liquor group, has decided against selling the
Tasmanian Cascade Brewery. The decision was announced as the group reported
net losses of NZDollars 33.96m (USDollars 18.3m) for the year to June 30,
compared with losses of NZDollars 54.7m for the previous 15 months.
It said the losses were due to depressed trading conditions, high interest
costs and write-downs on assets and brand values.
The directors said that, after spending nine months looking for a suitable
buyer, Cascade would not be sold. A price of NZDollars 140m had been
expected.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hostile conditions blamed for
ADollars 432m losses at Jennings

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JENNINGS, Australia's biggest homebuilder, yesterday announced a 1991-92
loss of ADollars 432m (USDollars 309m) after extraordinary losses of
ADollars 441m, and forecast that a revival of the commercial property market
may be delayed until 1997.
Jennings blamed 'hostile' conditions in non-residential property markets for
the poor result, which followed a comparable loss of ADollars 144m in the
previous year.
'It is now apparent that any recovery is distant and the normally-expected
cyclical upturn may not occur for three to five years,' the board said.
Jennings said the extraordinary loss included write-offs totalling ADollars
144m against two large commercial property projects in Victoria, together
with heavy losses incurred in the US and in Australian leisure projects.
The board said it had accepted proposals from its banks for an accelerated
sale of assets in the current year. The group is also undergoing a financial
restructuring supervised by Arthur Andersen, the firm of accountants.
The restructuring involves a debt-for-equity swap with Fletcher Challenge of
New Zealand, the group's biggest shareholder, which is intended to eliminate
its deficiency on shareholder funds of ADollars 212m.
Jennings said its core housing business was continuing to perform well in a
difficult period and had contributed to a pre-tax operating profit of
ADollars 8.7m, down from ADollars 9.5m in the previous year. Its shares
closed steady at 11 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange.

AUSTRALIA'S Trade Practices Commission (TPC) yesterday ruled that a ADollars
560m (USDollars 400m) hostile bid for Sagasco Holdings by Santos, a rival
oil and gas group, would contravene competition regulations and should not
proceed.
The TPC announcement, which reversed an earlier statement that it would not
intervene in the takeover, could force the South Australian state government
to find another buyer for its controlling 57 per cent stake in Sagasco.
However, few other companies had expressed much interest in the shareholding
in before Santos announced its bid last month.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Administrator completes sale of Airbreak
arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID BUCHLER of Buchler Phillips, the administrator for the Airbreak
Leisure Group, yesterday completed the sale of Sunsail International, one of
the failed tour operator's subsidiaries, for an undisclosed sum.
However it is thought the amount will be in the region of Pounds 2m, the
figure touted when Airbreak's management was trying to sell Sunsail in the
weeks leading to the USM-quoted group's collapse. The Civil Aviation
Authority has agreed to allow Sunsail to retain its licence.
Ironically, it was Sunsail - which provides sailing and club holidays in the
Mediterranean and was acquired by Airbreak in January for up to Pounds 8m in
shares and loan stock - which precipitated the fall.
When announcing the group's losses of Pounds 2.92m on September 15, Mr David
Lewis, Airbreak chairman, blamed heavy discounting in the charter tour
market, 'unexpected problems' in two of Sunsail's associated companies and
'wholly unanticipated demands for repayments of existing and long-term
overdraft facilities from Sunsail's two principal bankers'.
Sunsail is being sold to Mr Chris Gordon and his wife Sally. They were
managing director and marketing director respectively before and during the
Airbreak ownership and will continue in those roles. There will be no job
losses. The buy-out is backed by a 'major City institution'.
Two other Airbreak subsidiaries - Suntan Tours IATA and Airbreak Travel -
are still IATA-bonded as sellers of flights, rather than as travel or tour
operators. They are trading under administration, and Mr Buchler is looking
for buyers.
All the group's other subsidiaries have ceased trading with liquidation or
receivership awaiting.

music deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EMI MUSIC is to acquire the Sparrow Corporation, a Nashville-based Christian
music company, with the aim of introducing its recordings to a wider market.
Sparrow, which was founded in 1976 by Billy Ray Hearn, distributes music,
films, videos and books through Christian bookstores and other outlets
worldwide.
Mr Hearn said: 'Sparrow views its acquisition by EMI Music as an opportunity
to further its mission to promote the Gospel to the world through music.'
Mr Jim Fifield, EMI Music's chief executive, said: 'The acquisition of
Sparrow gives EMI immediate leadership in Christian music among the major
record companies.'
EMI Music is part of Thorn EMI, the UK-based music, rentals and light
fittings group. Thorn refused to say how much it had paid for Sparrow, which
had sales in 1991/2 of Dollars 30m.
Mr Jimmy Bowen, president of Liberty Records, EMI's country music label,
will serve as co-chairman of Sparrow with Mr Hearn, who will remain chief
executive.
Mr Bowen said: 'Contemporary Christian music is going to move into the
mainstream market place worldwide. Working in tandem with the finest
Christian record company in the world, Sparrow, we will launch a broad-based
marketing campaign to expand the presence of Christian recordings in
mainstream retail outlets.'

Pounds 31m

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS GROUP continued to struggle in the face of recession in the first
half as pre-tax losses swelled from Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 30.6m, writes
John Thornhill.
However, Mr James McAdam, chairman of the jewellery group, said that
although 'there were no signs of an easing of recessionary trading
conditions' operating margins were significantly higher than last year's
levels as a result of severe cost-cutting.
A comprehensive business review had led to Pounds 19m of cost reductions in
the first half, with Pounds 50m of savings expected in the full year.
Mr McAdam also promised that in the critical Christmas period Ratners would
place more emphasis on service and quality. Last year, the company indulged
in massive discounting, which boosted sales but savaged margins.
Sales in the period to August 1 fell to Pounds 365m (Pounds 450m).
Trading losses of the UK stores' jumped to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 11.7m) on
sales of Pounds 185m (Pounds 232m).
But in the US, although sales slipped to Pounds 179m (Pounds 219m),
operating profits rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 5.17m.
Group trading loss jumped to Pounds 18m (Pounds 7.13m) and interest took
Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.2m).
An extraordinary profit of Pounds 1.1m came from the disposal of Watches of
Switzerland.
Losses per share amounted to 11.3p (7.3p). Ratners is not paying an interim
dividend and is still rolling up payments on its preference shares.

integration and rationalisation of the previous years' acquisitions.
It incurred a reduced loss of Pounds 466,000, against Pounds 523,000, on

Since the end of the half year the group had traded profitably.
Detailed comparisons with last year's results were not meaningful, given the

cost savings.
Half year losses per share came to 1.57p (2.36p).

period and with a loss of Pounds 352,000 at the December year end. Turnover
fell to Pounds 948,000 (Pounds 1.54m) reflecting the sale of the Kurara Gold
Mine.
Losses per share emerged at 0.19p (earnings 0.15p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Control Securities, the property, hotels and pubs group, yesterday appointed
a new finance director and announced the agreement of a new standstill
arrangement with bankers.
The company named Mr John Kerslake as finance director, to replace Mr E J
Hewitt, who remains company secretary.
Control also said it had agreed an extension to the existing standstill
arrangement, set up to allow the company to develop a business strategy and
stabilise its financial position. The new agreement runs until October 31,
and is Control's third such extension to the original standstill negotiated
in June.
The group has also called a meeting of bondholders for October 12, to vote
on the deferral of interest payments until January 18.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Norex dives to Pounds 2m but payout held
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOREX experienced a significant downturn in the year ended June 30 1992, but
is confident for the current term and is holding the dividend at 2p.
Interests in shipping have been sold or written off, except for a small
chartering company, and in travel the loss-making London office has been
closed.
There was a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.77m in the year, compared with Pounds
9.6m, after exceptional charges of Pounds 3.95m against shipping.
Insurance broking was profitable, but was affected by shortfalls in
reinsurance and costs associated with the acquisition made in the year.
After tax and minorities there was a loss of Pounds 495,000 (profit Pounds
2.93m) to which was added extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.37m (Pounds
1.13m). They comprised losses from the discontinued shipping activities of
Norex America.
Losses per share came to 4.9p (earnings 29.2p).
Loans to Global Marine held by Norex America have performed above
expectations and the related borrowing reduced from Dollars 56m to Dollars
30m. The aggregate receivable from Global at the year-end was Dollars 100m.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker incurs Pounds 79m interim
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEN SCOBIE, chief executive of Brent Walker, yesterday said the company's
survival remained uncertain as the heavily-indebted leisure group announced
interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 79.4m and revealed that it had not yet
appointed a chairman.
Mr Scobie said it was 'too early to say whether Brent Walker is a totally
viable entity. . . We are only a very small part of the way down a programme
which stretches well in to the next century.' Brent Walker completed
Britain's largest debt restructuring in March.
The group's difficulties had prolonged the search for a chairman since the
retirement of Lord Kindersley in July. 'I do not think the chairmanship of
Brent Walker would be regarded as one of the plums,' said a resigned Mr
Scobie.
Brent Walker ended the six months to June 30 with operating profits of
Pounds 29.5m. This compares with Pounds 34.3m for the 28 weeks to July 14
1991.
The pre-tax loss was struck after total interest of Pounds 108m and Pounds
1m in exceptional charges for refinancing costs. It compared with a loss of
Pounds 133.5m last year. Turnover fell from Pounds 849.4m to Pounds 816.2m.
Mr Scobie said the company had not made much progress in reducing debt -
which stands at Pounds 1.3bn, after the Pounds 250m debt for equity swap.
When the restructuring had first been envisaged, Mr Scobie said, the company
had not believed it was 'looking at a recession of quite this depth or
length.'
About Pounds 71m in interest payments would be rolled into debt or converted
into instruments such as preference shares by the year-end.
As a result, net interest payable was significantly reduced from Pounds
117.9m to Pounds 37.3m. Most of this charge was due to the Pounds 350m debt
in betting chain William Hill.
Mr Scobie said Brent Walker would be able to service these reduced charges.
However, there remained the problem of how the remaining obligations would
be met when they fell due in 1997.
Operating profits in both the William Hill business and the Pubmaster
division declined in the first half. The return from betting shops fell from
Pounds 32.7m to Pounds 26.8m. Mr Scobie said the decline was a combination
of luckier customers and higher operating costs.
Pub profits fell almost 17 per cent to Pounds 6m, including a four-month
contribution from the 734 pubs leased from Allied Breweries.
Losses per share were significantly cut following the debt for equity swap,
from 259.47p to 42.48p. There was no ordinary or preference dividend.

<TEXT>
BETACOM, the telephone equipment supplier which is now 71 per cent owned by
Amstrad, said that it was rationalising its product range and refocusing its
business on the UK market as it reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.23m for
the six months to June 30.
It compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 129,000, and came on turnover of
Pounds 4.25m, down from Pounds 6.12m.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 1.97m was included in the loss; that related
to the cost of restructuring and product rationalisation.
Mr Ken Ashcroft, chairman, who moved in July to Betacom from Amstrad where
he was corporate finance director, said the restructuring and
rationalisation were necessary to regain lost market share in the UK.
Because of financial difficulties 'the company could not invest in products
in the early part of the year,' he said. It was doing so now by reducing the
number of products it offered and ensuring that it had the most up-to-date
range.
Following a difficult trading period, Betacom's bank had refused earlier
this year to continue supporting it without a capital injection. Amstrad,
which already owned 29.5 per cent of the shares, agreed to underwrite a
rights issue and subscribe to further shares.
In order to refocus its efforts on the UK market, Betacom had sold its 49
per cent holding in a German joint venture and was looking to wind up its
operations in Holland.
However, on the positive side, net asset value had increased significantly,
the liquidity problem had eased and there were adequate cash resources for
the foreseeable future, it said.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Arts: Fanfares for Masur, murder at the Met - New York Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kurt Masur, who has just begun his second season as the New York
Philharmonic's music director, seems to have decided that his first task
must be to develop their expertise in the central 19th-century European
repertory: Schubert, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Bruckner dominated his first
subscription concerts. But since the orchestra is marking its
sesquicentenary this season, there is some conflict between the earnest
pressures of the future and the celebratory wish to make a noise about the
past. Somebody had the odd idea of commissioning for the anniversary a whole
lot of orchestral 'fanfares': time-consuming things to write and to
rehearse, and destined for instant oblivion. Tobias Picker's Bang] was the
first of these to come and go, producing a stream of rushes, whistles and
flurries for three and a half minutes which is an awful long time for a
firework. Otherwise we were with the classics.
Masur's strengths in the repertory are obvious: his energy and his
self-effacing dedication to the task. But equally plain are his and his
orchestra's problems. Some of these have to do with the Avery Fisher Hall,
where a gentle rake his been introduced in an attempt to lift the woodwind
sound. This is not altogether successful, and the massed violin tone is
harsh - though the desperation in the orchestra's style is a matter more of
rhythm than of sound quality. Masur's emphatic downbeats give his players
too many immediate goals and encourage fuzzy attacks that suggest only a
frustrated forcefulness. That was particularly the effect in Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony, played here near the start of this jubilee season because it
was the very first piece the orchestra performed.
Alongside it, in an unusual moment of didactic programming, Masur placed the
First Symphony, in G minor, by Etienne-Nicolas Mehul, a work whose finale,
as Schumann was the first to observe, has a four-note tag similar to that of
the first movement of Beethoven's Fifth. But one can make too much of this.
Mehul's treatment puts a lighter touch on the three-note repetition, and
uses the idea for its spinning impetus rather than expounding it as a
thematic shape in itself. Then, more generally, there is the vast difference
in harmonic awareness, which makes questions of motivic correspondence
irrelevant.
To hear the Beethoven after the Mehul was to be confronted by a monument
after an ink sketch, and for that demonstration of how and why Beethoven
towers, the comparison was worth making.
Nothing uncommon so far at the Met, where the season's first offerings range
from a splendid Tales of Hoffmann, through an uneven Falstaff with old
troopers among the merry wives (Mirella Freni, Marilyn Horne), to a
depressing Madam ButterflyOffenbach opera is being presented in a new,
longer conflation of the old Choudens score with the Oeser edition, and with
a new set by the production's designer, Gunther Schneider-Siemssen, for the
Venetian act: a view out from something very like the Ca d'Oro, onto the
Grand Canal and a duly passing gondola, all very much in keeping with the
visual extravagance of the rest of the show. What is lacking is control of
movement and posture and interaction among the principals. Instead, four
great animals of the stage - Placido Domingo, Carol Vaness, Susanne Mentzer
and Samuel Ramey - are pretty much allowed to get away with murder.
Domingo portrays Hoffmann as a man anxious to catch up withe the creatures
of his own imagination, tugged on a tight wire between reality and desire.
Something of this may come out of a technical care, a manoeuvring of his
voice through the nasal sound of French, but the excellent effect is a
watchful reserve, overcome in moments of glorious abandonment, especially in
the third act. Vaness thoroughly enjoys the ironies of projecting herself as
a singing machine in the first act, and goes on to show a dignified
sensitivity as Antonia and a lusciousness as Giulietta. Mentzer as
Nicklausse is spectacularly good, singing with a winning enthusiasm and
freedom; Ramey links all the demands of the piece to a solid thrust of vocal
power, a steady glare. The orchestra under James Levine, both here and in
Falstaff, are luxuriously assured.
Not so their colleagues at City Opera, who labour through Busoni's Doktor
Faust in what is that opera's first New York staging. This is not a happy
debut for a famously challenging work. It looks consistently grim, the
entire action being played behind a screen, whose function is to interleave
the scenes between pages and diagrams from magical treatises (shades of
Prospero's Books), but which disastrously separates and occludes the stage
from the audience. William Stone as Faust - at once sure and insatiable,
majestic and troubled by dreams - deserves more prominent exposure. So does
Michael Rees Davis as Mephistopheles, triumphing against his better, lyrical
inclinations, and Eva Zseller as the Duchess of Parma, warmly conveying the
piece's only aria.

Just in time for Divali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, comes an absorbing
item on Down To Earth (8.00), C4's magazine programme on archaeology. The
Gundestrup Cauldron is the world's most famous cooking-pot. It has now
become the most enigmatic archaeological treasure ever unearthed in Denmark.
Archaeologists used to believe that this great silver cauldron of the 1st
century BC was Celtic.
Now they have wiped their spectacles and looked more closely. They discover
firstly that it was made in Romania and secondly that there are elephants on
the inside.
The controversial suggestion is that its makers were gypsies, the deities
are Hindu, and that Europe BC was blissfully multi-racial and multi-cultural
. . .
Which is emphatically not true of Kuwait, as the opening documentary of C4's
Critical Eye reminds us. Free Kuwait (9.00) goes over familiar terrain, the
Kuwaitis' dislike bordering on paranoid fear of the country's non-Kuwaiti
residents.
These are ingrained sentiments which, predictably perhaps, have not altered
one jot since the war.

CITY OF JOY (12) MGMs West End
BITTER MOON (18) Odeon Haymarket
CARRY ON COLUMBUS (PG) Odeon Leicester Sq
GAS FOOD LODGING (15) Metro, Renoir
In City Of Joy Patrick Swayze plays an American doctor who has a moment of
truth in the operating room. A patient dies; the doctor's inner world
collapses; then he goes off to India to find himself.
That is putting it crudely. But then this film directed by Roland Joffe from
Mark Medoff's screenplay based on Dominique Lapierre's book of stories about
Calcutta spends 130 minutes putting it and almost everything else crudely.
For this is the cinema of moral improvement; and improvement, for directors
like Joffe, involves a great deal of hitting the filmgoer over the head.
First, we must have two stories of spiritual self-reclamation, not one.
Paralleling Swayze's Indian salvation quest is the story of Hasari (Om
Puri), a poor Bengali drought-driven from his farm to become a rickshaw
driver in the city. (And he brings a wife, Shabana Azmi, who goes through
her own feminist self-realisation programme.) Secondly, every ten-ton cliche
about the Westerner lost in the East must be invoked as Swayze spends his
first days in Calcutta behaving as if he has strayed onto the moon. 'Do you
have a hamburger?' he asks perplexedly at a street cafe. And he is even more
perplexed by Dr Pauline Collins, an Irish Mother Teresa who would like to
recruit him for her 'City Of Joy Self-Help School and Dispensary'. (The lame
and the lost, side by side with life-enhancing music by Ennio Morricone.)
But out here in Calcutta, the disillusioned uncommitted American is still
making up his mind. Although he has a Dollars 30m movie marking time around
him, he is paralysed by self-pity. How to animate him? Joffe and Medoff
know. Bring on a couple of cardboard villains to catalyse the plot. Pin
Calcutta's problems of poverty and pain on two protection racketeers, the
Sydney Greenstreet lookalike Shyamanand Jalan and his snake-like son Art
Malik, who are bullying the Self-Help Centre and threatening to de-rickshaw
Mr Hasari.
Soon the sufferings of a city are tidily reduced to a set of standardised
snarls and fisticuffs; and here comes the monsoon in time to melodramatise
Hasari's climactic crise de rickshaw. This burst of plot pushes things along
nicely, so we can now move into the Ultimate Uplift phase of a Joffe film
when serious spiritual messages are spelled out for the deaf and dumb.
First Dr Swayze must make the right choice from the three life options
outlined by Doc Collins: 'To run, to spectate or to commit.' Then the
torment-tempered Hasari, who has turned over a new leaf and discovered his
wife underneath, must let the latter find herself through work. And finally
a reproduction of Gericault's painting 'The Raft Of The Medusa', which has
been mysteriously dragged through several scenes, must be spotlighted as a
Major Metaphor. Explains Swayze, the painting is a parable of hope. The
dying cling heroically to the raft while the other figures gaze off into the
distance symbolising human optimism. Ah great art: it is so simple when you
explain it.
City Of Joy feels like a Sunday School sermon slumming it as a movie.
Alternately pie-eyed and patronising, schematic and sentimentalised, it
repeats the pattern of Joffe's previous films: the large-screen spectacle
and cast of hundreds belying the puny message about human hope that we end
up with. In The Killing Fields the Cambodian struggle was reduced to a moral
play-off between selfish West (Sydney Schanberg) and brave compassionate
East (Dith Pran). In The Mission Western evangelism was vanquished, after
two hours of token brouhaha, by noble savagery. And in City Of Joy a group
of characters who begin by telegraphing their lost status to us as crudely
as comic-book characters end up being redeemed, no less crudely, each by his
own designer suffering.
Roman Polanski's Bitter Moon, though no less risible at times than City Of
Joy, at least suggests that human beings are complex organisms; and that
people who go to India to find themselves often lose themselves long before
they get there.
Take Nigel and Fiona (Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott-Thomas). Cruising through
the Med on a luxury liner - their ultimate destination India and its 'inner
serenity' - they meet a nutty American in a wheelchair called Oscar (Peter
Coyote). Also present: Oscar's disturbed, beautiful, possibly nymphomaniacal
French wife Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner).
Soon Oscar is drowning whisky by the tank-load while he regales the
disconcerted Englishman with his marital sex history. S and M; golden
showers; multiple orgasms; whips; guns. It is all too much for Nigel who
keeps interrupting with 'Steady on, old boy' or 'For God's sake, man]' and
begs Oscar to get a grip on himself. Sadly this is all that Oscar, crippled
by one of Mimi's more imaginative escapades, can now do anyway.
How long before we come to a menage a trois or possibly even quatre? Not
long: 2 1/4 hours by my watch and they fly by in this black comedy based on
Pascal Bruckner's novel Lunes De Fiel. How many of the movie's giggles are
intentional we cannot know. Did Polanski mean his Nigel and Fiona to be
quite such chinless wonders from the inner reaches of Belgravia? Did Mr P
and his co-screenwriters Gerard Brach and Alan Brownjohn mean Oscar's
voice-off narrations to be quite so orotundly loopy ('Eternity for me began
one July day in Paris . . .', 'We were soon headed for sexual bankruptcy . .
.').
But then again those hundred-odd photographs of great litterateurs on
Oscar's Paris wall - Hemingway, Stein, Fitzgerald - must be a gag anyway.
And that image of the electric toaster that pops its load, in one French
flashback, just as Oscar is about to pop his load - surely another jape? We
would be astonished if Polanski's tongue were not firmly in his cheek here
and elsewhere.
I found this film monstrously funny: a Ship Of Fools hi-jacked by the
Marquis De Sade, a Poseidon Adventure turned turtle from upright family
entertainment to murky erotic adventurism. There is something perversely
splendid about a movie that keeps gazumping its own excesses. And there is
something straightforwardly splendid about Peter Coyote's performance: a
drawling, savage, acerbic showpiece that swiftly establishes Oscar as second
cousin to Albee's Martha in Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?
Carry On Columbus is the week's third film in quest of India and the year's
third film in quest of Columbus. It may be the worst in each set. This
voyage hardly sets sail before its crew - Jim Dale as Columbus, Julian
Clary, Bernard Cribbins, Aexei Sayle - are attacked by savage comparisons
with the old Carry Ons and by man-eating memories of Kenneth Williams, Sid
James and Co.
A few early puns raise a faint smile. 'What makes you think he's up to it?'
quavers Leslie Philips' King of Spain about Columbus; 'I've seen his
testimonials' coos June Whitfield's Queen. But the film is soon bare of wit
in the script (by Dave Freeman) and barer still of that wild, honking energy
in the acting that once, circa Nurse, Doctor and Up The Khyber, covered the
naked bits in the dialogue.
According to Gas Food Lodging, a small-town mood piece by first-time
film-maker Allison Anders, Laramie, New Mexico, is a strange town. It
consists of women bursting into tears and men taking unfair advantage of
their distress. Two sisters trying to take the swift non-scenic route to
maturity - the young Shade (Fairuza Balk) being urged on towards
self-discovery by the older Trudi (Ione Skye) - are hindered by watchful Mum
(Brooke Adams) and helped by the rabid male population.
Between tender talk scenes in the family trailer home there are assorted
pick-ups, near-rapes and pregnancies, plus a increasing sense of
seen-it-all-before. Chief redeeming merit: the director's peripheral vision.
This takes in all the wonderful dime-store El Dorados masqerading as
interior decor in these parts. Surrounded by Jesus pictures, dayglo rocks
and luminous crucifixes, you too might hitch a ride out of town with the
first eligible rapist.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Arts: Who Shall I Be Tomorrow? - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plays about suicide, like suicide attempts, rarely convince. The quiet get
on with it, the noisy are already in therapy. Bernard Kops' latest play, Who
Shall I Be Tomorrow? at the Greenwich Theatre tells the story of a faded
actress who tries to take her own life. It makes confusing, inconsistent
theatre.
The evening's strength is the lustrous Joanna Lumley, who takes the lead in
this two-hander with Harry Landis; the acting is a delight; the evening's
weakness is the plot, a pattern of inanity occasionally crossed by moments
of insight.
A play which welcomes you with the unshaven singing of Tom Waits and a
programme filled with cuts from Sylvia Plath and Stevie Smith promises no
laughs; but depression is not taken seriously enough. Kops wrote better on
similar themes in his Playing Sinatra (1991), also about domestic
claustrophobia and depression.
Lumley plays Rosalind, a once famous and now out of work actress on
telephone vigil in a London bedsit. Her chaotic world is penetrated by
neighbourhood noise, from Deep Purple's 'Smoke on the Water' to Bach's
double violin. The other character, a gay jazz pianist called Gerald (Harry
Landis), visits from upstairs: 'So why are you depressed?'
The action takes time to form itself into anything dramatic. Lumley is
always winning and diverting, sashaying around in pyjamas throwing out lines
of Macbeth or The Dybbuk. She moves effortlessly through extremes: monstrous
conceit to pathetic uncertainty, and with the clipped attention-span of the
profoundly depressed. But Kops' writing shapes her character too obviously.
So, predictably, she falls in love with her therapist and fantasises an
affair; her childhood was not a forgotten boredom but a horror of parental
cruelty. And she is agoraphobic.
Opposite Rosalind, Gerald hums Weill and croons Hollander. He has problems
in the shape of Desmond, an unconvincing lover from the north. But he helps
Rosalind, injects her with confidence, and unwittingly prevents her suicide
at the end by announcing his own pain when Desmond leaves. Finally, she
fixes an identity of sorts in playing many parts ('I'm not a seagull, I'm an
actress'), but this looks contingent and unconvincing. However, this final
scene works best, because it shows rather than tells; Matthew Francis'
direction brings the characters alive here. They are really, as Fats Waller
nearly said, two needy people too much in love with themselves to say
goodnight.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Arts: Il Trovatore - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Mark Brickman's new Scottish Opera production, Verdi's great melodrama
seems a very archetype: absurd story, great tunes, nothing much else. The
first-night audience accepted it happily in that spirit, so it may count as
a success.
Darkly lit by Ben Ormerod, Tim Hatley's sets - tall strips of moveable wall,
curved this way and that for different scenes - serve well enough, as they
might for many another opera. Brickman's directorial hand is visible only in
the same sort of way: the soloists are moved carefully from place to place
(some waving their arms more, some less), but otherwise left to their own
routine devices. Some routines, of course, are better than others.
The chorus were drilled to a Dalek unanimity. Super-careful articulation
robbed their music of full Italianate fervour, though they can make a lusty
sound, and their anvils in the Anvil Chorus were terrific. As the hero's
rebel troop rescued the heroine from the villain's forces with ludicrous
tameness, however, we got the surtitle 'All sense of reason is gone'; for a
moment one thought that Verdi, like Strauss later, must inadvertently have
set a stage-direction to music.
The Australian soprano Lisa Gasteen (Cardiff winner last year) made a
stately, placid Leonora, varying her facial expression from gracious smile
to worried frown as the action required. Big voice, attractively warm;
technique not equal yet to sharp rhythms, and rapport with the conductor
decidedly weak. As the hero Manrico, Kenneth Collins gave us his reliable,
all-purpose, hell-for-leather impersonation of the archetypal Italian tenor
 -short on finesse, maybe, but firmly committed and sometimes stirring.
For subtlety of colour and dramatic response (even in a vacuum), there were
visiting Slavs to admire. The gypsy Azucena was Ludmila Nam, a mezzo from
Kazakhstan whose exotic facial cast lent a bonus to a mature and generously
felt performance. The Muscovite Vladimir Redkin has a dusky, 'inward' timbre
at his disposal as well as heroic menace, and his Count di Luna was less of
a bully than usual, more a creature of private anguish.
On this showing, the conductor Richard Armstrong is not well attuned yet to
middle-period Verdi. The pace of the music was often heavy-footed, despite
the occasional manic rush forward; what should be rapt, suspended moments
were regularly jostled. He fell upon any passage in waltz-time like a
Teutonic conductor finding homely relief at last in alien territory. The
last act, which crowns Il Trovatore as a great melodrama, should exercise a
steady, relentless grip, but here it was disappointingly choppy and
sectional. We expect much more from Armstrong, and will in due course surely
get it.

Who is the Centre for Policy Studies' favourite couple? Why the newly-weds,
of course, columnist Barbara Amiel and publisher Conrad Black, who will be
in Brighton next week for the Tory party conference fresh from their
two-month 'working honeymoon'.
The Thatcherite thinktank CPS has asked Amiel to deliver its annual lecture
 -traditionally held on the Thursday of the conference. Two years ago,
Conrad Black was the guest speaker. His fiercely anti-federalist words,
entitled 'Conservatism and the paradox of Europe', fanned a heated debate,
including on the board of CPS, which found itself in less than complete
harmony over Europe.
Amiel, meanwhile, is set to speak on the suggestive subject: 'What women can
expect from John Major'. Observer can't help feeling the more urgent
question is what the nation can expect from its prime minister.

Is there more than meets the eye to last week's shuffle at the top of
Northern Telecom, the ambitious Canadian telecommunications equipment maker?
Northern's spin-doctors are insisting that the arrival of Jean Monty as
president and chief operating officer is merely a long-planned move to
lighten the load on Paul Stern, the hard-driving American who has up to now
carried the titles of chairman, chief executive and president.
Monty was previously chairman of Bell Canada, Canada's biggest telephone
utility which, like Northern, is controlled by BCE Inc of Montreal. He
brings with him a personable style and wide contacts among Northern's key
customers in the North American telephone business. But some outsiders
speculate that Monty's main job will be to keep an eye on his boss. BCE is
said to be concerned, among other things, with the way Stern has largely
transformed Northern from a Canadian to a US company, hiring American
executives for key jobs and moving a chunk of the head office from Toronto
to Washington DC.

Out-of-work intellectuals need worry no more. Singapore wants you.
George Yeo, Singapore's minister of information and arts, has just unveiled
his ambition to create a cultural and intellectual habitat in the island
republic. Interesting minds, said Yeo, would be attracted to live and work
in Singapore. Men and women of ability would be welcomed, including those
without jobs in the former Soviet Union.
'We are tolerant and cosmopolitan because that is in our very essence, not
by choice but by necessity,' said Yeo. 'No matter the land he hails from,
every visitor finds a little of home in Singapore.'
Former Soviet citizens may well agree. Thanks to a ban on satellite dishes,
Singapore citizens cannot watch foreign TV. Films and videos are carefully
censored. The press is most polite to the government. There's a ban on the
sale of foreign publications, such as the Far Eastern Economic Review and
Cosmopolitan magazine, which might offend Singaporean political or moral
sensibilities.
Oh yes. Former Soviets should also remember to leave their chewing gum at
home. It too is prohibited.

Thank heaven Sidney and Beatrice Webb didn't live to see it. After all,
besides founding the London School of Economics, the prim Fabian couple
returned from Stalin's Moscow in the 1930s extolling Soviet communism for
eradicating 'spooning in the parks'.
So they'd be appalled by the doings of the 4,000 folk inhabiting LSE's
Lifemod computer simulation model - a population invented by the school's
researchers in order to analyse the impact of tax and social security on UK
incomes.
Take Mr 62 for a start. Having had two children with Mrs 3678 who has now
left him to marry Mr 1083, he has shacked up with Ms 2858, a single mum with
two children and a third on the way. From the timing of her kids' arrival,
it looks as though the caddish 62 was philandering with her beforehand.
Another marriage that has fallen apart around two children is the one
between Mrs 2072 and Mr 254, who had seemed so contented during their 11
years together. Even so, he has found solace with Miss 3454, a 42-year-old
spinster, and they show every sign of being settled for life. Meanwhile his
ex-wife, evidently something of a raver, has had another child in her early
40s without bothering to marry the father.
What's worse is that such irregular goings-on are apparently essential if
the model is to simulate the real behaviour of a typical group of 2,000 men
and 2,000 women; 'assortative mating' is the researchers' term for it.
But at least Lifemod's lascivious denizens don't live long enough to get a
telegram from the Queen. Whatever their efforts to survive, they're killed
off automatically at 96.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Leipzig trades its past for free-market future: The problems
facing companies battling for a share of Europe's fastest-growing
construction market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pussycat Club in Leipzig comes as a crushing disappointment to the men
from Tarmac, the UK construction group searching hard for profits where most
British builders still fear to tread.
Only when they are off the 7am flight from London do they realise that
colleagues' tales of wild parties at the Pussycat are intended to poke
gentle fun at the former East German city, not best known for the quality of
its night-time entertainment. Neither the club, nor anything like it, yet
exists.
After a 12-hour day, the reality for the small team leading the British
company's high-risk assault on a tough new market is dinner and a few drinks
in 'digs' at number 8 Hoyerstrasse, a stylish, suburban house in an area
once reserved for leading Communist party members.
There are sitting tenants, with a heavy-footed teenage son on the second
floor; one room at the top of the house is sub-let to Sir Frederick Snow,
the British engineering company which is also keen to do business locally.
Good accommodation is hard to find.
Leipzig, whose status as a trade-fair centre had at least allowed capitalism
across its threshold, is now open to anyone ready to help rebuild a city
blackened by lignite dust and crumbling after four decades of neglect.
As arrivals make their way along cobbled streets, past barracks where
soldiers of the former Soviet Union buy battered Skoda cars for resale back
home, they confront an entire city in desperate need of modernisation and
renewal. But despite land-ownership disputes, contaminated sites and hidden
arms dumps, the former east Germany is Europe's fastest-growing construction
market - and Tarmac wants a piece of the action. Estimates suggest that
building work in the former East German states worth more than DM2,000bn
(Pounds 790bn) could be generated over the next 12 years.
At home, Wolverhampton-based Tarmac is battling to stem the financial
haemorrhaging inflicted by recession. It has recently announced interim
losses of Pounds 15m, while profits for 1992, at about Pounds 25m, may
barely match the figure notched up in just three weeks during the heady days
of 1989.
The Leipzig initiative, part of a strategy to broaden the construction
group's base across an expanding market, is one which other companies must
imitate if the political vision of a single European market is to be
converted into commercial reality.
Tarmac has set up a European division to embrace its continental ambitions.
It has already bought a motorway construction business and a share of a
building company in France, while Schal International, its management arm,
is developing the first phase of a Pounds 500m business park in Berlin. An
acquisition in Hungary may be next.
In Leipzig the company's efforts to weld together two alien business
cultures and to build a bridgehead to other eastern European markets will be
closely watched by competitors.
'It's more like venturing into the third world than into a mature, western
market. There are 'gold rush' towns sprouting up all over the place,' says
Mr Steve Reding, managing director of the company's European operation.
There is, as yet, little hint of any gold rush in the run-down yard of Bau
Nord, the Leipzig building business which was on its knees when the
hard-hats from Wolverhampton acquired it in March.
So far, there are few outward changes at Bau Nord. There are a couple of new
trucks with the Tarmac logo slapped on them. The car park which, until
recently, housed the Trabant for which the last boss had waited 14 years,
now boasts a Porsche owned by one of the carpenters.
Inside, however, a revolution is under way among an 80-strong workforce
which is technically competent but commercially at sea.
'We are only here for a while to implant our skills. It will be run by
Germans as soon as possible,' says Mr John Thomson, the Stoke-born general
manager who is trying to get by with his 'pigeon deutsche' in a company
where only two of the non-British speak good English.
With productivity levels estimated at less than half those in the west of
Germany, the company has already tried a productivity bonus scheme, but it
failed miserably. 'The men don't like pressure; they go sick. There is no
'go-for-it' mentality - but it will come,' says Mr Thomson.
'No one knew what deadlines or personal responsibility meant. Everyone would
go around in pairs like Siamese twins so that no one individual could be
held liable for anything.'
Pay is still below levels in western Germany but, by government decree, is
rising step by step, leaving many workers better off. They are now on about
77 per cent of the pay levels achieved in the west of the country.
The company's employees, despite the challenge of adapting to foreign
bosses, have welcomed British owners who saved them from certain redundancy.
'There is so much resentment against the west Germans who moved in quickly
to our country to pick up the best work. Everything is seen to be for their
benefit, not for ours,' says Janette Gothel, a former state interpreter and
now the company's new marketing manager.
'We believe the English have come to put down roots. But the workforce now
realises that western management does not just mean lots of new equipment
which will do all the work for them. Now they know what is expected of
them.'
The more informal British management style has also come as a big shock to
those weaned on formality. The newly arrived contract estimator could not
pick up his pay because his work documents described him as Michael while
his real name appeared to be Mike.
'We are surprised just how cool and calm the English can be. I sometimes get
upset when problems arise but they don't seem to worry. They tell jokes in
serious situations and it is beginning to catch on,' says Elke Hubner, the
new finance director.
The Leipzig city fathers are also pleased to see Tarmac. Hans-Jochen
Richter, project co-ordinator for the local municipality, is thrilled at the
challenge that commercial freedom and a rising state budget gives his
department: 'We never dreamed we would be able to work with partners like
this.'
Tarmac's new acquisition has about DM20m of work on its books, a fragment of
the potential business in an economy that has several decades of
construction work to catch up on. It is a modest start and any prizes will
be hard won; there is unlikely to be much time left for daydreaming about a
night out at the Pussycat Club.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Letter: Previous devaluations no guide to present one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MUELLBAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Maynard ('Devaluation - a remedy that has not worked in the
long run', Letters, September 16) is right to remind us that some
devaluations, such as those of the 1970s, have been failures. But conditions
in the 1970s were very different from those prevailing now.
Excess capacity and unemployment were low so that the flexibility of
response to a devaluation in the output of tradeable goods and services was
weak. Inflation, after the raw material, oil price and house price booms,
was rampant. Real interest rates for borrowers were negative throughout the
1970s, and the benefits of mortgage interest tax relief were amplified by
inflation. Unions were powerful and governments were ready to bail out
strategic loss-making firms. How circumstances have changed]
The risks of a wage-price devaluation spiral can be further reduced by a
package of government policies.
That includes such possibilities as holding down retail prices by lowering
VAT to 15 per cent, paid for by higher income tax, a tax on wage increases
(successfully applied in Czechoslovakia) and longer range reforms, including
a commitment to regenerating private rental housing. The supply side and not
consumer demand must pull the UK out of this recession. That should be the
aim of policy.
Professor Maynard, like Samuel Brittan, tends to underestimate the domestic
demand origins of inflation and overestimates the effects of the exchange
rate. That tendency, shared by Mr Nigel Lawson, contributed to the policy
errors since 1986 which led to the overheating of the economy and the
inflationary boom. This boom, of which I warned from autumn 1986 onwards, is
ultimately the major reason for last week's devaluation. It could scarcely
be the other way round]
Samuel Brittan ('Economic Viewpoint: Devaluation defeat - how '92 differs',
September 17) questions the competitiveness indices that were one of the
four reasons I gave for claiming that sterling was overvalued.
He prefers absolute purchasing power and the UK share of exports. Neither
are very reliable. Most economists agree that the purchasing power parity
theory is much better supported in its relative than its absolute form.
Relative to the 1960s and 1970s, purchasing power indices have very similar
profiles to the indices in my chart ('FT, Personal View: Crunch for
sterling', September 14).
One reason why export share figures are unreliable is that these share
figures reflect other forces such as the huge relative rates of growth of
Japan, Korea and other newly industrialised countries which led to falls in
trade shares elsewhere in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. Japanese inward
investment in the 1980s in the UK was a function not only of competitiveness
but of the welcoming attitude of the government and of cultural and
linguistic factors.
Another reason is that, in the 1980s, the share of exports overstates the
improvement in the real export performance of UK manufacturing. That is
because UK manufacturing became more of an assembly operation, so that the
import content of manufactured exports rose sharply. From 1985 to 1991,
imports of intermediate goods grew 63 per cent while manufactured imports as
a whole grew 39 per cent and exports 27 per cent.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Letter: Oil companies' right to fear supermarkets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM HODGSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Guy de Jonquieres and Neil Buckley ('Supermarkets vie to fill up tanks
as well as trolleys: an increase in shopping around for petrol is worrying
oil companies', September 28) may have inadvertently misstated some
realities.
The average supermarket petrol site sells six times the volume of petrol
sold by a conventional petrol station. Petrol is a significant contributor
to profits for Sainsbury's and Tesco. In a price war between supermarkets
and oil companies, the former would win hands down. They are not burdened by
the oil companies' overheads.
It was no surprise to this company, which has produced a motorist's guide to
petrol, that an important oil company refused to co-operate with the
production of unbiased consumer information.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Letter: Scheme to speed debt payments contains flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH TUNSTALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The suggestions of Mr Martin Simons ('Far reaching consequences of
paying promptly', Letters, September 26) for speeding debtor payments are
fine in theory but are unworkable in practice.
Mr Simons refers to 'agreed terms' but in practice terms are rarely agreed.
An invoice endorsement of '21 days nett' is not binding on the purchaser
unless specifically agreed to. Parties have opposing interests: the seller
to receive payment as early as possible; the buyer to pay as late as
possible. Mr Simons' suggestion of a rolling 35-day settlement cycle is
impractical.
Most businesses of any size use calendar monthly accounting, and make a
purchase ledger payments run at the following month-end. Some businesses are
dilatory at sending their invoices in, yet expect prompt payment. Charging
interest on overdue accounts is fraught. Many large companies would resist
paying it, and the danger of soured relations is one which many small
suppliers may not care to chance.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Oilseed dispute raises fears of trade war between EC and US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has given the European Community until noon today to agree to binding
arbitration on its oilseed subsidy regime, twice condemned by a panel of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as contrary to Gatt rules.
Rejection by the EC, which has consistently refused any form of binding
procedure, would bring the Community to the brink of all-out trade war with
the US just as senior officials from both sides are planning a push to break
the deadlock in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
Equally critical, the ultimatum shows that the US is threatening to abandon
Gatt as a channel for resolving this dispute, endangering the foundations of
the trade system overseen by Gatt.
Trading partners have become increasingly anxious in recent years that US
frustration with the Gatt system of resolving disputes will tempt it to use
its might to settle them unilaterally.
Mr Julius Katz, deputy US trade representative, said in Washington: 'If the
proposal is rejected, that pretty much exhausts the Gatt process and we will
have to draw appropriate conclusions. However, there is still the
possibility of a negotiated agreement.'
Washington stopped short of saying it would impose tariffs on Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 580m) of EC food imports if Brussels did not swiftly remedy the
trade losses to US soyabean farmers from its subsidy regime.
The EC has refused to change the subsidy system, offering trade concessions
instead that have been rejected by the US and other oilseed producers.
Brussels says it will retaliate if the US imposes sanctions.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to the Gatt, told Gatt's governing council the
US was insisting on an effective procedure to determine 'once and for all'
whether the EC was going to implement the panel findings on oilseeds or
whether aggrieved parties had the right to retaliate.
Mr Yerxa said the US could not accept EC proposals for a loosely structured
working group with no powers to arbitrate.
Under the original US proposal, a three-member panel would determine within
30 days how much damage the EC subsidy regime caused oilseed exporters. If
the Community rejected the panel findings, trading partners would have the
right to retaliate.
The US has put global trading losses at Dollars 2bn a year, with its own
soyabean farmers accounting for Dollars 1bn. The EC says the figure is no
more than Dollars 400m.

FT  01 OCT 92 / US report on BCCI expected to attack Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONDUCT of the Bank of England is expected to be severely criticised
today in an 800-page report on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
scandal to be released in the US Senate.
The Senate sub-committee report, which follows a four-year investigation led
by Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, will pre-empt some of the
findings of the still unpublished UK report on BCCI by Lord Bingham.
Yesterday, Mr Kerry said: 'We've known for a while that the BCCI scandal
would turn out to be the biggest example of financial crime in recent
memory, but it also demonstrates a grotesque network of greed and
influence.' Others expected to be criticised in the report include the
government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholders of the collapsed BCCI,
and Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditor.
Abu Dhabi has been repeatedly criticised by Mr Kerry and US prosecutors for
withholding documents and witnesses from US authorities. Last week Abu
Dhabi's Washington lobbyists claimed Abu Dhabi was now co- operating with
the US.
Abu Dhabi's Washington representatives said US officials would be able to
study 19,000 pages of BCCI-related documents at the Washington embassy of
the United Arab Emirates but not take possession of them. Separately, it has
been learnt that US officials are investigating the role of Abu Dhabi in the
BCCI affair. Abu Dhabi has always described itself as a victim of the fraud,
saying it lost billions of dollars as a result of the scandal.
UK Foreign Office officials are understood to have been trying to monitor
the timing of the Kerry report's release in recent weeks; the report has
been de-layed by one week past its originally scheduled publication date.

FT  01 OCT 92 / EC pressure improves jobs rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government, under pressure from the European Commission, is to change
the law to give more employment rights to some public-sector workers.
The move follows the threat of legal action by the commission and will give
more legal protection to workers who lose their jobs or are re-hired on
worse terms when local-authority work is contracted out.
Under the 1981 British transfer regulations, passed to comply with an EC
directive, employers must honour the employment contracts they inherit when
they take over or merge with other commercial ventures. However, when
public-sector or other non-profit-making organisations change hands,
contracts are considered terminated.
The commission argues that the government is failing to enforce the
directive fully and has begun proceedings to take the UK to the European
court.
The government has now agreed to add an amendment to its planned employment
bill, due in the next parliamentary session, to extend the protection to all
workers.
The main effect is expected to be to benefit those employees who are
adversely affected by the contracting-out of local-government work under the
compulsory-tendering procedure. In some cases, companies have won contracts
under which they have recruited many of the council's existing workers for
lower pay, and others have been made redundant.
Councils have lost 38,414 jobs as a result of tendering since March 1987,
according to the Local Government Management Board. A further 2,000 jobs are
expected to be removed from direct employment by March.
The proposed law may deter some private contractors from bidding for
contracts. Companies have been attracted by the contracts partly because
they have been free to cut wage costs.
The proposed law will compel employers to consult representatives of the
workforce before any transfer of ownership or control. Employers do not have
to consult workers unless they recognise unions.
The government has agreed to strengthen the penalties employers face for
breaking the law. Employers found to have breached the present regulations
need pay only two weeks' wages in compensation.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Engineer lobby resists decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW industrial pressure group aimed at reversing almost 50 years of
decline in Britain's manufacturing and engineering industries was launched
in London yesterday.
The UK Industrial Group expects to draw its membership from mainly small to
medium-sized manufacturing companies.
The 30 founding companies, representing a variety of manufacturers from all
over the country, are launching a recruitment drive to increase the group's
membership to 1,000 companies by the end of next year.
The group is to seek a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, the Industry
Secretary. It is demanding the creation of a national economic policy to
foster closer co-operation between government, industry and the City of
London.
The strategy is more in tune with the industrial policies of the 1960s and
1970s than the 1980s.
Mr David Turnbull, director general of the new pressure group, said that in
the '80s 'Mrs Thatcher saw off the unions but then left industry to sort it
out in a free-for-all which was fatal'.
He said the group was non-political and that British manufacturing's ills
could be blamed on a succession of different governments and the development
of a national culture that encouraged youngsters to become bank managers and
accountants rather than encouraging them to be engineers.
Mr Turnbull said there was a lack of strategy in the economy, such that
Britain's industrial base had been neglected for more than four decades. The
position was deteriorating almost daily.
The group believed that reversing Britain's balance-of-payments deficit was
the key to turning the economy round. The City had to be encouraged to
invest in manufacturing.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Italy 'pressured US over Iraqi loans affair'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Italy put strong pressure on the Bush administration not
to indict the state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in connection
with the scandal over Dollars 5bn of illegal loans to Iraq, made by BNL's
Atlanta branch, according to documents released in an Atlanta court
yesterday.
The documents describe numerous diplomatic initiatives by Rome, including a
March 1990 White House lunch meeting at which Mr Rinaldo Petrignani, Italian
ambassador, warned Mr Richard Thornburgh, then US attorney-general, that a
BNL indictment could affect US-Italian relations.
The ambassador is quoted as having insisted that BNL was a victim in the
Atlanta fraud and having said the bank should be considered by Washington as
'an organ of the Italian Government.' He went on to say that, if the bank
were indicted, this would 'add insult to injury' and 'would not be
understood in Italy, especially in the context of collaboration between the
two governments in the field of judicial investigations.'
The documents were made public as Mr Christopher Drogoul, former BNL Atlanta
manager, made his long-awaited court appearance, and for the first time
began naming the names of the BNL executives in Rome alleged to have known
of the Iraqi loans.
Mr Drogoul testified under oath that, in 1988, Mr Giacomo Pedde, then BNL's
chief executive in Rome, told him: 'I am aware of the recent agreements you
have concluded with the Iraqis. I want you to do everything you can to
support the Iraqis at this time. It is very important for us here.'
According to testimony, Mr Pedde - who refused to appear in Atlanta court
this week, saying he felt ill - had previously told Mr Drogoul: 'I want to
mention to you that the relationship we have with Iraq at this time is very
sensitive.'
Mr Drogoul also named Mr Teodoro Monaco, a BNL Rome executive whom he had
also met during a visit to Baghdad, as having been fully aware of the Iraqi
loans from Atlanta.
Both Mr Drogoul's testimony and the documents released appeared to cast
serious doubt on the central premise of the US government's case against Mr
Drogoul - that BNL Rome knew nothing of the Iraqi loans because the Atlanta
manager had acted entirely on his own.
The documents disclosed yesterday were a series of reports on the Atlanta
investigation by Mr Paolo Di Vito, a BNL Rome executive.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Politicking may delay new cabinet in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN impasse over the formation of a new cabinet could leave Brazil without a
president until Monday.
Vice-President Itamar Franco had been expected to be named acting president
by the Senate today, after the landslide congressional vote on Tuesday night
to suspend President Fernando Collor from office while he is tried by the
Senate on charges of corruption.
But, to widespread surprise last night, Mr Franco asked the Senate for more
time to assemble a cabinet.
This reflected the difficulties he is having in reconciling the various
parties which supported impeachment of Mr Collor. Party leaders and state
governors spent the day in discussions at Mr Franco's residence, but with
little result.
However, Mr Paulo Haddad, an economist from Mr Franco's home state of Minas
Gerais, emerged as planning minister and Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso
of the social democratic PSDB, as expected, was named foreign minister.
The biggest problem lies with the crucial new finance portfolio. Mr Orestes
Quercia, leader of the Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Brazil's largest,
refuses to accept in the job anyone from the PSDB, vetoing the widely tipped
economist Mr Jose Serra and preferring an unnamed figure from the Sao Paulo
business community. In retaliation, the PSDB is threatening to stay out of
the Franco government.
Moreover, both these parties and the left-wing Workers' Party are objecting
to inclusion in the government of friends of Mr Franco, warning that this
could result in problems similar to those faced by Mr Collor.
'It is becoming a war of vetoes,' said one disgruntled participant in the
negotiations. Mr Alexandre de Barros, a political consultant, said: 'It is
very depressing to see such lack of political maturity in the division of
the spoils.' Many senators were irritated by the requested delay, which
might not be granted.
Mr Franco is known to dislike speedy decision-making. Yesterday, he admitted
that the new cabinet might not be ready until Monday. Meanwhile, Mr Collor's
cabinet will remain as caretaker.
The trial of Mr Collor, who is suspended for 180 days during the process,
began yesterday afternoon, after the result of the vote in the House of
Representatives and the formal request for Mr Collor's suspension from
office had been handed by Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, House chairman, to Mr Mauro
Benevides, Senate chairman, yesterday morning.
The overwhelming 441:38 vote in the House of Representatives exposes Mr
Collor to judgment by the Senate on charges of benefiting from an extensive
corruption network during his term of office.
If found guilty, he would be ousted from the presidency, and barred from
public office for eight years.
A spokesman for Mr Collor said the president had no plans to resign: 'The
word resignation has not been mentioned by him.' His spokesman said Mr
Collor would collaborate with the transfer of power: 'He wants the process
to be civilised and to cause the minimum possible social agitation.'
The festivity which greeted the impeachment vote has continued across the
country. Demonstrator after demonstrator proclaimed: 'We're proud to be
Brazilians.'

SENATORS Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici yesterday made a bipartisan appeal for a

budget deficit.
At a news conference, they urged a radical re-shaping of the tax system,
involving the replacement of personal income taxes by consumption taxes, as
part of a strategy to increase national savings and balance the federal
budget by 2002. They also urged deep cuts in planned federal spending so as
to help pay for more investment in education, training and commercially
relevant research and development.
Mr Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, and Mr Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, were
releasing the first report of the Strengthening of America Commission, a
bipartisan group of 60 prominent Americans assembled by the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ last night sought United Nations approval to sell Dollars 4bn of oil
and oil products over six months with the proceeds going into an escrow
account for food, medicines and other essential civilian needs.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Mr Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, the Iraqi
foreign minister, said the Security Council could choose the countries where
these items might be bought, 'according to normal commercial practices'.
Iraq was ready to donate 5 per cent of the funds raised to the Red Cross and
Red Crescent for relief efforts in Somalia, Bosnia Hercegovina and
elsewhere.
The Security Council last year approved the sale of Dollars 1.06bn of Iraqi
oil for humanitarian needs, to compensate victims of the invasion of Kuwait
and meet some of the costs implementing UN resolutions. But after intensive
negotiations Iraqi officials and UN representatives failed to agree on
terms.
Mr al-Sahaf said this was because 'humiliating preconditions' were imposed.
The new offer, which seems hardly likely to be acceptable, was made after he
denounced efforts now under way by the Security Council to authorise the
seizure of about Dollars 1bn of Iraqi oil assets abroad, mostly in the US.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QATAR yesterday accused a Saudi Arabian force of attacking a border post in
a desert region, writes Our Foreign Staff. But the Saudis later claimed the
incident involved a gunfight between bedouin nomads within Saudi territory.
The flare-up highlights the sensitiveness of Gulf states over their border
areas inland and offshore.
The official Qatari news agency QNA said a Saudi military force killed a
corporal and an Egyptian working with the Qatari military and captured a
Qatari soldier. It said the clash damaged the al-Khofous border post about
130km south-east of Doha.
But the official Saudi Press Agency said there was an exchange of fire
between bedouins inside Saudi territory, resulting in the death of two
Qataris and one Saudi. 'Another Saudi was injured as a result of the
shooting, which was started by the Qataris,' the agency added.
Desert borders have been notoriously difficult to agree and have caused
squabbles even between closely allied countries. Qatar has a dispute with
Bahrain over territorial waters, while the United Arab Emirates is embroiled
in a growing crisis with Iran over control of three islands.

THE presidents of Croatia and the rump state of Yugoslavia announced
yesterday the Yugoslav army would pull out of the strategic Prevlaka
peninsula, which it has occupied for many months, by October 20.
Mr Franjo Tudjman and Mr Dobrica Cosic also agreed their largely hostile
states would work towards mutual recognition.
The text of an eight-point document was read to journalists by international
mediator Mr Cyrus Vance as the two presidents - whose forces waged a bloody
war last year - stood alongside.
At the same time Lord Owen, with Mr Vance co-chairman of the Geneva
conference on former Yugoslavia, announced that the warring sides in Bosnia
had agreed to talks on demilitarising the republic's beleaguered capital,
Sarajevo.
In their declaration, hammered out during a day of discussion chaired by Mr
Vance and Mr Owen, the Croatian and Yugoslav presidents also promised to
work for a 'just, peaceful solution' of the Bosnian conflict. They condemned
the practice of 'ethnic cleansing' or driving other ethnic groups from their
homes.
They further agreed to co-operate in ensuring people forced out of
Serb-controlled areas of Croatia could return to their homes. Thousands of
Croat refugees have been threatening to march back into 'Sector East' of
eastern Croatia where Serbs have set up a mini-state.
United Nations officer in Osijek yesterday averted just such a march by some
1,000 men and women refugees to return to their homes in Baranja abandoned
last autumn.
Colonel Viktor Loginov, a UN officer, on a road just south of Osijek, warned
the crowd to wait for the UN to let them return home.
UN officials had feared the march would have led to violence and could have
jeopardised the UN peace plan which has created four protected areas in
Croatia.

MORE than 210 people were killed in a battle between Kurdish separatists and
Turkish troops near the Iraqi-Turkish border, Reuter reports from Ankara. It
was the bloodiest engagement since Kurds launched a guerrilla campaign for
independence in 1984.
Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel said 29 soldiers and 174 fighters of the
separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) died in the 12-hour battle on
Tuesday around Semdinli. Five civilians and three village guards also died.
About 500 guerrillas took part in the fighting.
Mr Demirel said the government did not know what to do about the
Kurdish-based People's Labour Party (HEP), which has 18 seats in parliament,
but which is accused of backing separatism.
Turkey's state security court prosecutor has asked parliament to lift the
immunity of HEP deputies against whom he wants to bring charges which can
carry the death penalty.
About 5,000 people have been killed in Turkey since the PKK began its war
for independence in 1984.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission still hopes to double EC spending on research and
development over the next five years in spite of the growing likelihood that
member states will rein back the research budget.
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the EC's research commissioner, yesterday
unveiled plans for a fourth 'framework' programme of research and
technological development which would involve spending Ecu14.7bn (Pounds
11.48bn) between 1994 and 1998. The 1990-94 programme is worth Ecu5.7bn.
Research and development is part of the 'Delors II' package of proposals to
increase the overall EC budget between 1993 and 1997. But it is one of the
areas most likely to be squeezed when EC leaders discuss the final budget at
the Edinburgh summit in December.
'I know full well that this is very much under discussion, but we don't see
any good reason at this stage to deviate from the proposals in the Delors II
package,' Mr Pandolfi said yesterday.
If Mr Pandolfi gets his way then the funds will be concentrated on certain
key areas which the Commission believes can best be dealt with at a European
level.
They include 'generic technologies' which might benefit all sectors of
industry, and 'big science' - large research programmes like the human
genome project (the genome is the sum of all genetic material in a given
organism) which require multinational collaboration.
The Commission is also keen to encourage co-operation with third countries
and international organisations, improve the dissemination of research
results and the training and mobility of EC researchers.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK and France agree on Maastricht ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK prime minister John Major and French president Francois Mitterrand agreed
yesterday on the need for EC states to advance 'as Twelve' to ratify the
Maastricht treaty.
After a 90-minute talk at the Elysee Palace, Mr Major said the French
president showed 'no impatience, but a lot of understanding and agreement'
with him on the difficulty of pushing the Maastricht treaty on European
union rapidly through a UK parliament, which is divided on the issue.
A joint statement issued by the two leaders indicated that Mr Mitterrand is,
for the moment, more anxious to help than to pressure Mr Major on the
treaty's ratification.
The two leaders 'stressed the importance of the Community developing as
Twelve and respecting the interests of each member state', the statement
said. 'In this context, they looked forward to the ratification and entry
into force of the Maastricht treaty.'
The absence of any mention of timing on ratification will be helpful to Mr
Major, as well as to his Downing Street dinner guest last night, Mr Poul
Schluter, the Danish prime minister.
Before meeting Mr Major, Mr Schluter called for a 'new basis' for the
Maastricht treaty as a condition for a new referendum in Denmark next year.
He said he saw 'common ground' with other EC countries on the need for more
openness and less bureaucracy in EC decision-making. On the question of the
timing of any new referendum, he said: 'Whether it is May, June or September
(next year) - it's a bit too early to say.'
After assurances from Mr Mitterrand that France and Germany were not
hatching a fast-track move to a restricted economic and monetary union,
excluding the UK and other weaker EC economies, Mr Major said: 'I don't
think any of us want to see what is loosely called a two-speed Europe.'
After Mr Major congratulated Mr Mitterrand on the outcome of the French
referendum, the two men agreed that 'the debate in France and elsewhere
about the Maastricht treaty had revealed public concern about the need to
build a Community which respected national identity and to avoid Community
involvement in matters which should remain the subject of national action'.
Mr Major and Mr Mitterrand signalled their hope that the forthcoming EC
summit in Birmingham would produce 'a clearer understanding of the
respective competences of the member states and the Community'. German
chancellor Helmut Kohl has also made it clear that he is on the same
wavelength as the British and French leaders about the need for greater
'subsidiarity'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will today offer a vigorous defence
of the Maastricht agreement, coupled with a warning that the UK's interests
are unlikely to be as well-served without the treaty, when he addresses a
meeting organised by the European Policy Forum, a London think tank.
In a speech which will set the government's line of argument in coming
months, Mr Hurd is expected to argue that Maastricht represents the opposite
of a blueprint for a federal Europe.
The range of feeling in the Tory party on the Euro-sceptic side of the
argument was underlined again yesterday, as Lord Ridley, a former cabinet
minister, rebuked the government for holding the Bundesbank responsible for
sterling's difficulties in the exchange rate mechanism.

FT  01 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Chemicals sector hit again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICALS group Courtaulds became the latest victim of brokers' downgrades
with James Capel, the leading London institutional broker leading the way,
cutting its profit forecasts for the second time in little over a month.
Courtaulds shares tumbled 32 to 456p after Capel reduced estimates by Pounds
15m to Pounds 185m this year and Pounds 205m for 1993-4. Other houses,
including Kleinwort Benson and BZW, followed suit after talking to the
company.
Like ICI on Monday, Courtaulds hinted at dismal trading over the past three
months - raising the spectre of further downgrades ahead in the chemicals
sector. Capel analyst Mr David Ingles said: 'Courtaulds has been
experiencing pressures on volume and price across its whole range of
businesses, particularly in the last two months. Even after today's fall,
the shares are still too high and we foresee weakness up to the interims in
November and (the shares) down to around 420p.'
However, Mr Martin Evans at Hoare Govett, who earlier this week led the
downgrading of ICI, was more bullish. 'Courtaulds is highly operationally
geared to any upturn in its key markets. We believe its discount rating to
the market more than reflects the current poor trading news and we recommend
buying into the present weakness.'
Forte sale hope
Prospects for interim results today from Forte took on added spice after it
emerged that television and leisure group Granada had expressed interest in
buying Gardner Merchant, the hotel company's catering subsidiary. The sale
of Gardner, which could raise in the region of Pounds 430m, is central to
Forte's strategy of expanding its hotel operations in Europe.
Forte has been hinting that interim profits may barely exceed Pounds 30m,
but some analysts believe such suggestions may be on the bearish side.
Yesterday, Forte edged back a half-penny at 135p, with Granada up 4 at 262p.
Granada's hints over Gardner Merchant came at private briefings to analysts
and brokers. The company said it would consider a move for the catering
group should Forte fail in its lengthy attempts to find a suitable buyer,
and hope to extract a better price than Forte was currently seeking.
Trafalgar active
Conglomerate Trafalgar House, whose shares have recently been depressed by
financial worries, traded briskly on hints that its Cunard subsidiary was
about to sell six ships to P&amp;O. Such suggestions were roundly denied by the
company after the market close, but one analyst noted 'such a sale would
nevertheless make sense'.
The shares closed 5 1/2 better at 60 1/2 p, as turnover rose to 10m shares.
Trafalgar was also the subject of two conflicting broker's recommendations.
BZW, which lost its position as joint broker of the company last week, was
reported to have weighed in with a sizeable profits downgrade, reducing its
current year estimate by Pounds 45m to Pounds 60m. The broker was also
understood to have concerns regarding the dividend.
Morgan Stanley also reduced its current year profits forecast, cutting its
figure by Pounds 15m to Pounds 80m. Analyst James Ritchie, however,
recommended the stock saying, 'the company is in the process of changing.
There will soon be announcements on the (management) succession which will
clarify the direction of the company.' He believes the company will pay a
covered dividend. P&amp;O closed 7 ahead at 389p, on trade of 5.9m.
Burmah Castrol continued to lose ground, unsettled by broker sell
recommendations, and the shares slipped a further 7 to 638p.
BP came under strong selling pressure during early trading and drifted back
to 210p, as at least one influential London broking house detailed the bear
case on the stock and recommended a switch into Shell. However, the stock
later rallied to close a shade firmer at 214 1/2 p, on active turnover of
12m. Shell were aggressively traded to end a busy session a fraction off at
537p on turnover of 2.7m.
The banks endured another painful session, with County's bearish stance on
TSB said to have triggered the 4 decline to 129p in the shares after heavy
turnover of 5.4m. Lloyds, recently pinpointed by County as a sell, fell away
to 438p before rallying and closing marginally higher at 432p on 3.4m
traded. Property worries continued to bear heavily on Barclays shares which
came under consistent downside pressure to close a further 14 off at 337p on
sizeable turnover of 6.4m.
HSBC attracted the heaviest turnover(10m) in the high street banks, slipping
back to 391p on stories of a Dollars 75m provision taken against one of its
US divisions.
However it recovered strongly to end the session unaltered at 400p. The
recovery was helped by a buy note issued by Smith New Court highlighting the
impact on the group of the appreciation of the US dollar and the more
favourable macroeconomic environment in the UK.
In the broking sector, Hogg Group jumped 14 to 131p, after reaching 134p, as
the market expressed its satisfaction at the maintained interim dividend.
Sturge followed Tuesday's 7p jump with a further improvement of 10 to 90p,
in sympathy with Hogg.
Gloom in the property sector was deepened by Scottish Metrolpolitan's
decision not to pay a final dividend. The company said: 'In recent months
property investment and letting markets have shown marked deterioration,
resulting in a further decline in values,' adding that its net asset value
had slumped from 145p to 114p in the last year. Some analysts said that the
company's spread of assets, mostly commercial lettings split 60:40 between
Scotland and England, and positive cash flow might make it an attractive
target for other property groups wanting to spread their geographical base.
The shares recovered to close 2 off at 24p.
Following Sears gloomy results on Tuesday, Great Universal Stores retreated
over worries regarding its mail order business. Sears had reported flat
trading at its Freemans catalogue subsidiary. GUS 'A' shares lost 33 to
1560p. Sears fell 3 to 77p.
In transports, BAA gained 14 to 736p, with UBS Phillips and Drew reported to
have shown a keen interest in the shares.
Among engineers, TI Group fell 20 to 270p, after Kleinwort Benson downgraded
current year profits forecast. The stock was further weakened by fears of
provisions at the Dowty Group subsidiary.
The first signs of renewed confidence at British Aerospace were seen
yesterday following Tuesday's long meeting with analysts. The shares bucked
the poor market trend to end 10 up at 128p.

FT  01 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currency fears unsettle equities
again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor

<TEXT>
RENEWED weakness in sterling depressed the UK stock market yesterday,
casting a shadow over hopes that domestic interest rates might be trimmed
again later this week. Share prices moved erratically in London, rallying
after a 22 point fall on the FT-SE Index reflected a dip in sterling towards
the DM 2.50 rate.
The final reading put the Footsie at 2,553 for a net fall of 12.5 points on
the day. Trading volume on the Seaq network increased to 641.7m shares from
Tuesday's 533.8m, with a batch of trading programmes crossing the electronic
screens as institutions made final re-arrangements to their third quarter
showcases. But fund managers showed little interest in opening up new equity
positions ahead of the final quarter of the year which begins today. Stock
Exchange data showed that retail business on Tuesday was worth Pounds 1.1bn,
maintaining the improvement of recent sessions.
A very large trading programme arrived overnight from a leading US
investment bank, to be followed later in the London session by a substantial
two way programme from a UK securities house and then by a small sell
programme from a London investment bank.
Traders stressed that there was no heavy selling but said that investment
confidence seemed to have weakened since the heady days which followed
Britain's departure from the ERM system. Equity strategists are disturbed by
the sharp rises marked up in Government Index-linked bonds, the prime
anti-inflation investment instruments.
Indications of an increasing risk factor in equities were reflected in the
continued flow of brokerage downgradings of leading UK companies. Yesterday
brought hints of a re-rating of Courtaulds, a further blow to a chemicals
sector already disturbed this week by downward revisions on ICI.
Hopes of a further cut in UK base rates, dented on Tuesday by the warning on
exchange rates from the governor of the Bank of England, were unsettled
afresh when a Bundesbank spokesman discouraged speculation on German
interest rate policies ahead of tomorrow's council meeting of the German
central bank.
'Sterling is not going back into the ERM because nobody really wants to go
back in, they do not really want us back in and we would not last even if we
went back in,' was the summary of City views put forward by Nick Knight of
Nomura Research.
Weakness in the US dollar against sterling brought falls in the
US-influenced stocks which have played a significant role in the market's
advance over the past fortnight. The fear that sterling's continued fall
will undermine the chances for base rate cuts kept store and retail issues
on the downward path. Ratners, the retail jewellery chain, disclosed a
Pounds 30m loss, re-affirming the bearish tone of other trading reports from
the retail sector over the past week.
Banking stocks, which have been badly hit by warnings of widespread profits
downgradings ahead from the brokerage analysts, staged an uncertain rally
yesterday.

FT  01 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading

<TEXT>
STOCK index futures had a dull but volatile session as Tuesday's late talk
of a cut in German interest rates faded, and the continued weakness of
sterling led to the belief there would be no cut in UK base rates either,
writes Joel Kibazo.
The strong opening of December at 2,603, was quickly reversed by a strong
bout of selling which soon dried up leaving the contract to go better.
The advance to 2,618 seen around 10am was surrendered as worries over the
economic outlook gained the upper hand, and December traded sideways for
most of the rest of the session with the early dullness in the other
European markets also taking its toll.
The late burst of traders covering positions led to a reversal in the
fortunes of December sending it sharply forward on a squeeze. It closed at
2,617, down 9 on its previous session and about 25 points ahead of its fair
value premium to cash of about 40. Turnover was poor at 7,498 lots.
Traded options were dull with total turnover reaching a mere 21,301
contracts, well below the market's 30,000 break even level, with the FT-SE
100 option trading 7,253 contracts.
ICI was the most actively dealt stock option with a day's total of 1,010
lots.

BOND Corporation, the former quoted flagship of Mr Alan Bond, yesterday
announced net losses of ADollars 435m (USDollars 311m)for the year to June,
increasing its accumulated losses to ADollars 2.5bn.
This was better than the previous year's ADollars 642m, and its losses of
ADollars 2.24bn in 1989-90. Sales fell 54 per cent to ADollars 155m,
reflecting the continuing sale of the group's assets.
Bond Corp has been operating under a scheme of arrangement administered by
Ferrier Hodgson, an accounting firm, since August 1991, 11 months after Mr
Bond was forced to resign as chairman.
Mr Ian Ferrier and Mr Garry Trevor, the joint administrators, said the
latest loss was attributable mainly to ADollars 198m in interest expenses
and unrealised foreign exchange losses of ADollars 187m.

PERNOD-Ricard, the French drinks group, mustered a 30 per cent increase in
net profits to FFr389m (Dollars 81m) during the first half of the year but
has cautioned that its growth may be slower in the second half.
Mr Patrick Ricard, chairman of the group whose products include Pernod and
Orangina, the fizzy fruit drink, described the interim performance as 'very
good', but said the economic slowdown in France, as well as the recessions
in the UK and US, could affect the group in the second half.
However, he stressed that Pernod still expected to meet its target of
boosting growth by twice the annual inflation rate - now at 3 per cent in
France - for the full year.
A strong performance from Orangina was a key catalyst of Pernod's growth in
the interim period. Consolidated sales fell by 3.5 per cent to FFr6.9bn, but
sales rose by 9.3 per cent on a comparable basis. Operating profits rose
11.6 per cent to FFr651m over the first six months of 1991, when the group
was hit by the disruption caused by the Gulf War.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ferruzzi tightens its control at
Fondiaria after fall in profits

<TEXT>
FONDIARIA, the Italian insurance group, seems set for more management
upheavals after a shift of responsibilities for Mr Alfonso Scarpa, its
managing director.
Mr Scarpa, who oversaw the group's recent growth, has run foul of the
Ferruzzi group, which controls the company with Mr Camillo De Benedetti, the
Italian financier, through a joint holding company.
Mr Scarpa's responsibilities were apparently diluted earlier this year when
Mr Carlo Sama, a senior Ferruzzi executive, was appointed as his joint
managing director.
The process has now gone further. Mr Scarpa runs everyday operations at the
group's three main insurance subsidiaries, and Mr Sama has overall strategic
responsibility.
The dispute with Ferruzzi arose over declining profitability at Fondiaria,
which has just reported a 20 per cent fall in gross group profits to L78bn
(Dollars 62.60m) in the first half of this year from L97bn in the same
period in 1991.
Group premiums rose by 17.6 per cent to L2,777bn. Domestic non-life premiums
climbed 12 per cent to L2,000bn, while life premiums increased 13 per cent
to L297bn.
Fondiaria's expansion, notably building up a 20 per cent stake in Germany's
Aachener und Munuchener Beteiligungs (AMB), has been viewed increasingly
critically by Ferruzzi, which has decided to take a more active role.
Among alternatives being considered to improve profitability and lower debts
are the sale of some stakes, perhaps including that in AMB.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Property boom casualty list
grows - How European investors took risks in North American real-estate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIST of those paying a heavy price for stoking the red-hot North
American property boom of the 1980s keeps on growing.
Besides US savings and loans, Japanese financial institutions and North
American real-estate developers, it is now evident that many supposedly
cautious banks and individuals in continental Europe took enormous risks in
a market whose collapse has proved to be every bit as spectacular as its
rise.
The European involvement has come to light through the bankruptcy of
Montreal-based Castor Holdings, the top company of a tangled and mysterious
international property syndication empire headed by German-Canadian
financier Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg.
It will be some time before the full extent of the pain suffered by Castor's
shareholders and lenders is clear, but few would be surprised if these
losses eventually top CDollars 1bn (USDollars 800m). Mr Stolzenberg, who
also has other business interests in Europe and North America, is said to
have lost about CDollars 30m himself in the Castor debacle.
With assets of CDollars 2bn at the end of 1990, Castor did most of its
business in the riskiest part of the real estate market.
It provided second and third mortgages and construction loans to developers,
either to top up first mortgages pro-vided by banks, or to bridge the gap
until permanent fin-ancing could be put in place.
During the 16 years of its existence, Castor financed some 55 to 60
properties in North America, ranging from New York's Gorham Hotel, to
condominiums in Florida and one of Montreal's biggest shopping centres.
Much of its money was sunk into hotels and undeveloped land, which are among
the forms of real estate least likely to generate a strong cash-flow when
the economy turns sour.
Castor's biggest creditor is the Chrysler Canada pension fund (with an
exposure of more than CDollars 200m). But the bulk of its funds came from
European banks and individuals.
The names on a creditors' list drawn up by Richter &amp; Associates, the
bankruptcy trustee, range from Credit Suisse, BHF Bank, Sal Oppenheim &amp; Cie
and Banque Nationale de Paris, to numerous individuals identified only by
their initials or by the lawyers representing them in Germany, Switzerland
and Liechenstein.
'People were investing many millions,' says one of the small army of lawyers
representing Castor's shareholders and lenders. As a result, 'Castor could
take time and go to some cost to investigate the best way of doing its
transactions.'
For more than a decade after its formation in the mid-1970s, its investors
enjoyed handsome returns. Second and third mortgages carry premium in-terest
rates, and the company also extracted sizeable fees from developers for
arranging finance for their projects.
These deals also provided huge tax savings, especially to Germans. With the
help of tax experts at auditors Coopers and Lybrand, Mr Stolzenberg
channelled about half of Castor's funds through subsidiaries in
jurisdictions which had negotiated favourable tax treaties with Germany.
The most active offshoots were in Ireland, Cyprus, Curacao and the
Netherlands. By using these vehicles, German lenders were able to pay a much
lower rate of tax on their interest income than they would by investing
directly in North America.
Castor's equity ballooned from CDollars 2.1m in 1978 to CDollars 191.6m in
1990. Assets, almost all in the form of high-risk mortgages, grew from
CDollars 18m to CDollars 1.9bn.
As a private company, Castor was not obliged to issue prospectuses, and much
of its business appears to have been done by word of mouth. 'They spent a
lot of money doing beautiful presentations,' says a lawyer representing some
of the individual investors.
Many questions remain to be answered, however, about Castor's life and its
death. Among them is its relationship with two property developers, Imry
Merchant Developers of the UK and York-Hannover, most of whose business is
in Canada.
Mr Stolzenberg acquired a controlling stake in Imry in 1989. According to
accounting records in Zug, Switzerland, which were examined by auditors Peat
Marwick, Castor provided a CDollars 93m loan to Imry, which itself has
financial difficulties. Peat acted as a 'co-ordinator' for Castor while it
was under court protection earlier this year.
However, Mr Neil Stein, a Montreal lawyer representing Castor's directors,
said he had been told by Mr Stolzenberg and Imry directors that 'they are
unaware of any amount of money being owed by Imry to Castor or any of its
subsidiaries'. Neither Castor nor its creditors has so far lodged a claim
against Imry.
York-Hannover, controlled by Mr Karsten von Wersebe, Castor's co-founder and
former chairman, is at the centre of allegations in Switzerland that
Rothschild Bank of Zurich contravened banking rules by advancing more than
20 per cent of its capital in unsecured loans to a single customer.
York-Hannover also owes Castor CDollars 359m, of which CDollars 70m was
personally guaranteed by Mr von Wersebe.
Some of Castor's creditors raise questions about the cause of its problems.
They are not convinced that its difficulties can be explained completely by
the collapse in the North American real estate market.
Their uncertainty stems in part from Castor's highly complicated structure.
But according to one of the company's advisers, Mr Stolzenberg is eager to
co-operate with creditors and the authorities in sorting out Castor's
affairs.
The one certainty is that it will take months, if not years, to get to the
bottom of the Castor story. The process took another step forward last
Friday when the trustee and five 'inspectors' appointed to represent
creditors met to discuss where to go from here.
Mr Stolzenberg, who lives in London, is due to appear behind closed doors
before a bankruptcy receiver in Montreal on October 19. The trustee also
expects to interview Mr Stolzenberg at length within the next few months.

PHILIPS, the Dutch consumer electronics group, is facing an embarrassing
setback in its attempt to take the lead in the next-generation portable
audio market.
The launch, scheduled for today, of the digital compact cassette (DCC), a
digital audio tape format developed by Philips, has been marred by a lack of
pre-recorded digital tapes to listen to on the new machines.
Matsushita, the Japanese electronics group which is a co-developer of DCC,
launched the world's first DCC systems in Japan last month. But while
Japanese consumers can buy the much-heralded DCC machines, they cannot
listen to pre-recorded DCC tapes which are being withdrawn due to alleged
defects.
The DCC camp, lead by Philips, had said there would be about 500 titles
ready for the planned worldwide launch. However, Philips had to postpone the
launch of its machines due to defects.
The delay comes as consumer electronics makers prepare for the battle
between DCC and mini disc, a format similar to a small compact disc
developed by Sony.
Both DCC and mini disc are recordable digital audio equipment, but DCC
hardware can also play the traditional cassette tape.
The months before Christmas are crucial to sales.
Record companies said they expect the launch of DCC tapes to be postponed
until next month. The pre-recorded tapes, manufactured by Victor Company of
Japan, which is 52 per cent owned by Matsushita, represent mainly regional
titles.
Meanwhile, international titles, manufactured by Polygram, are still en
route to Japan and are not expected to arrive on store shelves for another
few weeks.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Sears Roebuck holds a
multi-billion stock clearance - The restructuring of once the world's
biggest retailer - its second in four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE derided by Wall Street as a lumbering giant that sold a mish-mash of
'socks and stocks', and under criticism from its shareholders for poor
performance, Sears Roebuck has taken the plunge. It is going to pull its
socks up by getting rid of the stocks.
In a bold move aimed at ending the company's decline from its
once-unchallenged position as the world's largest retailer, Sears announced
on Tuesday a large chunk of its financial services business, the most
profitable part of the group, would be sold to public and private interests
over the next 12 months.
By spinning off much of the non-retailing business, the company's long-time
chairman, Mr Ed Brennan, is admitting that his ambitious plan launched in
the early 1980s to meet the shopping and financial services needs of
America's middle classes has failed.
After the demerger is complete, Sears will be left with two core businesses
 -retail merchandising and composite insurance - and a lot less debt.
Analysts estimate that the restructuring will shrink Sears' total debt load
from almost Dollars 40bn to not much more than Dollars 16bn. About Dollars
3bn will be paid off from the proceeds of the sales, and the rest will
simply be shifted off Sears' balance sheet to the books of the newly-sold
companies.
Gone will be the highly-profitable stockbroking and credit card operation
Dean Witter Financial Services, the residential property brokerage and
relocation, mortgage and savings bank businesses of Coldwell Banker
Financial Services, and 20 per cent of Allstate, the group's big composite
insurance subsidiary.
The remaining 80 per cent of Allstate, which has been part of the Sears
empire since 1931, will stay within the group, where it will be run
alongside the struggling retailing operation which has acted as a drag on
the group's share price since the late 1980s. It was the poor state of the
retailing business that prompted this week's dramatic move.
For several years Wall Street analysts have argued that the strong
performance of the financial services operations was being overshadowed by
the weaknesses on the retailing side.
Shareholders felt they were not getting their full value from the company
because the share price never properly reflected the merits of the
individual businesses.
The performance of the stock has certainly been disappointing. After hitting
a high of almost Dollars 60 in 1987, Sears shares spent the next five years
bouncing back and forth between Dollars 30 and Dollars 40, despite a
prolonged bull market in US equities. The problem was twofold: earnings were
in decline, from a peak of Dollars 1.63bn in 1987 to a low of Dollars 902m
in 1990; and investors' perceptions of the company were dominated by the
troubles of the retailing business.
Dissatisfaction with the way Sears was being run reached a head at the
annual meeting in May this year.
A large group of shareholders, led by Mr Robert Monks, a professional
shareholder activist, put forward five proposals aimed at shaking up the
company and improving shareholder value. One of those proposals was a
demerger of the financial services operations.
Although Sears' management, led by chairman Mr Ed Brennan, initially
rejected the demerger idea, there is little doubt that the restructuring
announced on Tuesday is a result of the pressure from shareholders. Mr Monks
described the restructuring this week as a 'victory for the corporate system
in America'.
Wall Street certainly believes the demerger is good for shareholders. The
day it was announced, Sears stock jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/4 ,
and many of the analysts who had been quietly bullish on the stock this year
said Sears' actions justified their confidence in the outlook for the
company's earnings.
Mr Peter Siris of UBS Securities in New York was one of the many who
applauded Sears' move.
He said: 'Sears has a good value of between Dollars 80 a share and Dollars
90 a share, and the demerger does three things. It helps shareholders
realise some of that value, it creates pieces that people will be able to
understand so that the stock can fetch a fairer value, and it leaves the
retail people free to turn around the retail side.'
The restructuring of the retail operations is already under way. The company
has reduced staff by 48,000 in the past two years, and taken out Dollars 1bn
of costs on an annual basis. Further cuts are likely, says Sears' chairman,
Mr Brennan: 'In today's business climate you have to continue to pare away
at costs.'
Cutting costs is one thing, repairing the battered image of the company's
stores is another. During the 1980s, Sears was squeezed between specialty
and discount retailers, while its own stores looked increasingly antiquated
alongside the brash newcomers. Customers stayed away in droves.
Since the start of the 1990s, Sears has worked hard at reorganising the
layout and look of its 860 stores to bring them more up to date.
Even so, shoppers have been reluctant to embrace the new image. In the first
half of this year the merchandising side made a profit of Dollars 95m, but
that was entirely due to earnings from Sears' charge card business. Domestic
retailing actually made a loss over the six months of Dollars 140m.
Analysts say more work needs to be done to sharpen the identity of Sears
stores in a crowded market, and to nurse back to health the frail mail-order
catalogue business.
The Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency, however, said this week it believed 'a
more focused approach to marketing, broader merchandise assortments, along
with continued cost savings should yield some near-term benefits'.
Allstate, meanwhile, should require little attention. The company, which
brought in profits of Dollars 723m last year, is the second largest
underwriter of property/casualty premiums in the world, and unlike many
other insurers, it has a solid investment portfolio.
Although it faces a loss of Dollars 700m on claims filed in the wake of
Hurricane Andrew, Allstate should benefit from an expected upturn in the
insurance cycle and a rise in rates over the next few years.
The sale of the financial services units are expected to go well. Sears says
it hopes to bring in more than Dollars 3bn on the transactions. Dean Witter,
bought for Dollars 607m in 1981, has built a strong presence in retail
stockbroking, and last year, with the help of the fast-growing Discover
credit card business, made a profit of Dollars 345m.
Coldwell Banker made a profit of Dollars 61m last year, and it is possible
the operation will be sold in three different pieces: property brokerage and
relocation, mortgage provision, and banking.
The 20 per cent stake in Allstate that Sears is floating on the stock market
should also attract plenty of demand. Analysts estimate it could fetch
between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn, depending on how the insurer's assets
are measured.
The tumultuous changes at Sears leave its chairman, Mr Brennan, in a shaky
position. He will find it difficult to portray the demerger as his idea.
When dissident shareholders proposed spinning off the non-retailing
businesses earlier this year Mr Brennan reiterated his belief that the
diverse parts of Sears were more valuable operating under the umbrella of a
single corporate entity.
This is also his second major restructuring of Sears in just four years.
In 1988 he proposed selling the Sears Tower in Chicago, the world's tallest
office building, buying back Sears stock, and launching a new discounted
price strategy for the group's stores. The only part of the plan that
succeeded was the stock buy-back programme. Mr Brennan will be hoping for a

NET PROFIT at Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian steel manufacturer, dropped from
BFr3.1bn to BFr1.3bn (Dollars 42m) for the first half of 1992, hit by the
slump in steel prices.
The company said yesterday it expected to make a profit for the whole of
1992, providing steel prices and volumes did not deteriorate much further.
During the first six months of the year, Cockerill generated turnover of
BFr90.3bn, against BFr89bn last time.
The group said the figures were not directly comparable because of new
companies consolidated in the year. Adjusted for this, first-half turnover
at Cockerill, 87 per cent of which is owned by the regional government of
French-speaking Wallonia, slipped by 2 per cent.

ARMCO, the US steelmaker, yesterday warned its third-quarter loss would be
larger than expected, reflecting softness in the aerospace, automotive and
some electrical markets, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
It said its deficit would be slightly more than the Dollars 15m, or 17
cents, second-quarter loss, excluding one-time items.

MITSUBISHI Petrochemical, the leading Japanese petrochemical maker,
yesterday reduced its first-half pre-tax profit forecast to Y6bn (Dollars
49.6m) from Y13bn, and cut executive salaries by as much as 20 per cent,
write Robert Thomson and Steven Butler in Tokyo.
The company blamed the lower-than-expected profits on the slowing Japanese
economy, which has led to weaker demand for industrial products and severe
price competition. Sales for the first half to end September are forecast at
Y190bn, down from Y209.4bn last year, while pre-tax profits last year were
Y19.6bn.
Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, said yesterday consolidated net
profits for the year to March 1993 would drop by 49.4 per cent to Y20bn, a
60 per cent plunge from its forecast made in May.
Like other Japanese electronics companies, Toshiba has been forced to slash
its profits forecasts in response to the unexpectedly severe downturn.
Toshiba said its heavy electrical apparatus business, including power
generation equipment, continued to be firm. But sales of information and
communication equipment, including computers, remained poor.
Toshiba forecast sales of Y4,730bn for the year, 0.2 per cent up from last
year. Pre-tax profits would fall 30.4 per cent to Y80bn.
On a parent company basis, pre-tax profits are expected to fall to Y60bn
from Y70.7bn.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Traders maintain pressures on lira, peseta
and franc

PRESSURES on the lira, the peseta and the French franc continued to take
their toll on government bond markets in Italy, Spain and France, where
yesterday's budget forecasts failed to instil any confidence among investors
or traders.
'The monetary chaos in the exchange rate mechanism is overshadowing any
fiscal measures,' said Mr Steve Major, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais.
THE Italian financial system was subjected to further turmoil yesterday, as
the lira lost 5 per cent of its value against the D-Mark in early trading as
rumours of exchange controls, new taxes or a freeze on bank deposits
prompted a wave of cash withdrawals from banks.
Worries about the government's ability to steer the budget through
parliament further undermined the currency, as the wage agreement reached
earlier this year came under threat.
Despite the turmoil, Italian bond prices ended only slightly weaker. But a
series of Italian government bond auctions starting this week, totalling
L12,000bn, continues to unsettle the market.
Mr Juoni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg, said: 'Against this
background, it will be very difficult to raise those funds. In the last
quarter, as much as L250,000bn in gross issuance is needed. With talk of
capital controls and taxes one has to wonder where the money is going to
come from.'
SPANISH bond prices fell a further  1/2 point yesterday, and suffered a
further setback after hours, following the announcement that Spain's foreign
debt rating had been placed under review for downgrade by Moody's.
Speculation that the Spanish authorities will soon be forced to devalue or
to leave the ERM mounted yesterday.
FRENCH government bonds fell more than half a point yesterday, as the
authorities struggled to defend the franc with high money market rates.
BUND prices rose nearly half a point, as the German market continued to
benefit from its safe-haven status as expectations of a fast-track ERM fade.
The rally went ahead despite declining expectations of any reduction in
interest rates at Friday's Bundesbank council meeting.
The bund future on Liffe ended at 90.94, up from 90.50 at Tuesday's close.
THE gilts market shed a further  1/4 point at the long end, remaining steady
at the short end, as the yield curve continued to become more positive. The
long gilt future on Liffe ended at 97.08, down from 97.17 at Tuesday's
close.
US Treasury prices weakened slightly in light trading yesterday as many
investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of tomorrow's important employment
figures.
In late trading the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was  7/32 lower at 98
3/8 , yielding 7.379 per cent. The two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 3/8
to carry a yield of 3.787 per cent.
The market's attention is now firmly focused on the September employment
report, which some investors hope will be bad enough to prompt another
interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Analysts are expecting the
report to show a decline of about 120,000 in non-farm payrolls, with the
civilian unemployment rate rising from 7.6 per cent to 7.8 per cent.
NATIONALBANK, the Danish central bank, announced yesterday that it is
opening a new Treasury note programme from today, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
The series will be larger than earlier programmes. The intention is to
create a more efficient market.
In future, there will be only two series a year, compared with four until
now, and the maturity of the notes will be 2 1/2 years, compared with two
years on present series.
The coupon will be set at one per cent below the effective interest rates on
government paper with maturities of one to four years, said the bank.
The first series will be offered today with a coupon of 9.75 per cent.
THE gilts market was the best performing government bond market in local
currency terms during September, according to figures compiled by Kemper
Investment Management, writes Richard Waters.
The 6.2 per cent gain contrasted sharply with the 2.4 per cent fall by Irish
gilts, prompted by heavy foreign selling over the past fortnight.
The worst performance came from Canada, where renewed fears over the
country's constitutional position pushed bonds down by 2.6 per cent on the
month.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Tender withdrawal signals
Irish borrowing abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government yesterday withdrew a IPounds 10m exchequer bill tender
after failing to receive any acceptable bids.
The move signals the government's probable intention to reduce its variable
rate borrowing and, instead, to borrow abroad.
The weekly tender, small in comparison to the more usual IPounds 30m, was
expected to draw bids at a high rate of about 16 per cent, in line with
current interbank rates in the Dublin market.
The central bank raised its short-term facility rates by 3 percentage points
on Monday to 13.75 per cent, as pressure on the punt in the European
exchange rate mechanism continued to cause liquidity problems in the Dublin
money market.
Mr Brendan Lynch, chief economist at Bloxham, the Dublin gilt brokerage,
said the withdrawal of the tender was 'most unusual' and carried 'a very
strong message that the government is going to start borrowing abroad'.
Irish gilts have come under severe pressure since sterling left the ERM a
fortnight ago. This fuelled doubts that Ireland would be able to hold its
position within the ERM while the currency of its main trading partner, the
UK, floated freely.
Foreign holders of Irish gilts had, by yesterday, unloaded an estimated
IPounds 500m to IPounds 600m worth of stock, representing 12 to 15 per cent
of the IPounds 4bn they held two weeks earlier. This allowed Irish
institutions to pick up bargains, but put pressure on the government to look
towards foreign markets for its next round of borrowing.
At the end of this month, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA),
which now handles Ireland's entire national debt of IPounds 25bn, has to
refinance IPounds 230m of a maturing gilt issue.
It is also committed to a IPounds 60m to IPounds 65m issue of its 2012 stock
in the fourth quarter. No date for this has yet been set.
Yields on benchmark Irish gilts have risen sharply in the past fortnight:
the 20-year 8.75 per cent 2012 stock going from a yield of 8.7 per cent to
9.62 per cent; and the five-year 9 per cent 1996 capital loan stock rising
more dramatically from 9.35 per cent to 11.35 per cent.
A shift to foreign currency borrowing will mark a reversal of a now
well-established policy to cap Ireland's foreign debt of IPounds 8.9bn at
current levels, 65 per cent of which is denominated in D-Marks and Swiss
francs.
Analysts said, however, that as long as it is a short-term measure, foreign
borrowing should help improve foreign currency reserves - sharply depleted
by the support of the punt in the past two weeks - and improve liquidity in
the interbank market, easing pressure on interest rates.
'It will also underline the government's determination to continue defending
the punt,' said one analyst.
Mr John Corrigan, the director for Irish pound borrowing at the NTMA, said:
'It would not be helpful if we were to start funding immediately. Our
funding position is reasonably healthy. We will be able to take the
redemption in our stride.'
Monthly exchequer returns tend to show a surplus rather than a deficit in
the second half of the year, while the total exchequer borrowing requirement
for the year is not expected to exceed IPounds 300m. But about IPounds 400m
to IPounds 500m in short-term exchequer notes are in circulation at any one
time, and they require regular roll over and appear to be the first
candidates for replacement by foreign debt.
Should sterling continue to decline, budgetary targets for 1993 will be
thrown off-track, as a loss of competitiveness to the UK will result in
higher unemployment levels in Ireland and further pressure on government
finances.
The question of issuing debt as gilts or foreign currency-denominated bonds
might then become more problematic.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Moody's puts Spanish rating under
review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Spain faces a possible cut to its credit rating, days after
launching its first USDollars Eurobond issue.
Moody's Investors Service, which currently rates the country AA2, said it
had put Spain on review for a possible downgrade. The agency said the review
was 'motivated by the imbalances that have been accumulating for some time
in the Spanish economy, and the less favourable external environment faced
by the country'.
The announcement took the lead managers of Spain's recent Dollars 1.5bn
issue by surprise. 'We asked them whether they were happy with the ratings,
and they said yes,' one banker in London said yesterday.
News of the possible downgrading came on the day the bond issue was formally
closed. Earlier this month, NatWest Capital Markets withdrew a Eurobond
issue for Spintab the day before it was due to close when a possible
downgrade of the company was announced.
Yesterday's development added to the woes of the ill-fated Kingdom of Spain
issue, handled by J P Morgan and Merrill Lynch. The launch came at a time of
economic turmoil and pricing of the bonds was delayed a week.
During that time, a further change in withholding tax rules in Italy pushed
up yields on many Eurobonds, forcing the yield on the Spanish issue to be
raised to prevent a flop.
'At least 80 to 90 per cent of the bonds have already been sold,' one of the
lead managers said yesterday. 'This is obviously not something you want to
happen to one of your transactions.'
Explaining its decision, Moody's pointed to Spain's rising fiscal and
current account deficits. 'Recent events in European currency markets are
likely to make an economic adjustment in Spain more difficult, and could
ultimately lead to higher external indebtedness for the country,' it added.
In a quiet day for new issues, Goldman Sachs announced a rare straight
Eurodollar bond offering from a Korean borrower, Pohand Iron and Steel. The
bonds for the A2/A plus borrower will be priced on Friday to yield 115 basis
points above five-year Treasuries.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low prices force closure of
Argentine meat-packing plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MEAT-packing plant in Argentina part-owned by Citicorp has closed its
doors because export prices have fallen to the lowest in 18 months while
operating costs keep rising, a bank executive said yesterday.
'The decision was taken because it does not make economic sense any more,'
he said. 'International prices have fallen heavily and the instability in
Brazil, our biggest competitor, has contributed strongly to the decline.
They have virtually destroyed the market.'
Citicorp bought a 9 per cent stake in the loss-making state-owned Santa
Helena plant when it was privatised in March 1991. Although the bank,
together with leading meat-packing group Huancayo, its local partner, paid
only a token sum for Santa Helena, they reportedly invested working capital
of about USDollars 20m into the plant.
Brazil and Argentina are among the world's main exporters of processed beef
products. Trade in frozen and chilled beef is strictly controlled, with the
European Community, Argentina's main trading partner allowing imports only
of premium quality cuts. While Argentine businessmen complain bitterly that
Brazilian companies benefit from an undervalued currency and government
support, Argentina is slowly pricing itself out of international markets.
Citicorp recognised that inexorably rising costs in Argentina were
undermining Santa Helena's profitability. Wages in Brazil averaged Dollars
50 a month, compared with Dollars 500 in Argentina, said the executive.
Furthermore, although inflation has fallen to a modest 1 to 1.5 per cent a
month, the exchange rate has remained fixed since March 1990, leading to an
increasingly overvalued currency.
According to official statistics, the real exchange rate fell by over half
and prices fell 11 per cent in the five years to July 1992. Argentina's
overall trade balance has been in the red nearly all this year, accumulating
a deficit of Dollars 151.8m in the five months to May this year.
As a result, about 60 per cent of Argentina's meat-packers that operated in
the export market have now ceased operation. Only meat-packers that sell on
the local market, where they can charge higher prices, are still in
business. Huancayo and Citicorp decided to close Santa Helena after the
plant's rising losses threatened to drive the group - which still turned a
profit on the domestic market - into the red.
However, the Santa Helena plant is only being mothballed pending an
improvement in the international market. The Citicorp executive commented:
'Brazil cannot go on like this much longer and soon prices will settle down.
The government could also help, by providing credit lines and tax rebates'.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commodity prices 'at all-time
low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COMMODITY prices sank to 'an all-time low' in real terms last year,
according to the World Bank.
In its recently-published annual report the bank attributed this is bleak
news for the developing countries to a 'worldwide slowdown in economic
activity' - a trend which has only worsened this year. 'Economic
difficulties in the Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe generally
tended to lower commodity prices - except for basic food stuffs,' the report
continued.
Although price indexes for cereals and fats were slightly higher than in
1990, beverage prices were down by 5.9 per cent and sugar prices fell by
28.5 per cent. In fact, coffee, cocoa and tea prices hit all-time lows in
inflation adjusted terms.
One of the World Bank's commodity specialists, Mr Takamasa Akiyama, said
worldwide recession had only a short and medium-term effect on the price
declines. Basically, the difficulty in commodity production is the vast
productivity increases of the producing countries.
There are a number of factors contributing to productivity increases, but
one of them is the World Bank itself, according to some of its critics,
including Mr Kevin Watkins, senior economist at Oxfam.
'The bank's structural adjustment programme has contributed to the chronic
price depression by encouraging production of commodities for world markets
which are already saturated,' Mr Watkins said.
It had pushed production, he said, on the ideological assumption that each
country must produce what it produced best according to its 'comparative
advantage' - whether or not there was too much of a commodity around. It
also wanted to help the developing countries repay their debts.
'Should World Bank lending be guided by the demand of the Western banks?
That is a question it ought to address,' Mr Watkins said.
The bank has long recognised the danger in backing overproduction, and it
has often tried to restrict such lending. Mr Watkins said, however, that he
doubted that the bank's country departments talked to each other about their
loans. As one example, he cited support of palm oil production in both
Malaysia and Indonesia, two huge suppliers whose output significantly
affects world price.
The bank said it tried to limit commodity loans to countries that did not
have investment alternatives or simply needed to improve their current
productive capacity. However, between 1983 and 1986 it approved 15 projects
that were expected to lead to increased coffee production.
Mr Akiyama said the bank had little choice but to help a country increase
its productivity lest it lose out to more efficient producers.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clinton aims to bushwack US
agricultural vote - The candidate's Midwest campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILL CLINTON, the Democratic candidate for US president, is doing all he can
to ensure that he reaps a bumper harvest of votes on the Farm Belt.
Recognising that the Midwest could be key to victory in November, he has
promised more effective management of the US Department of Agriculture,
support for ethanol (vegetable-based fuel oil), and tough action against
overseas protectionism.
Last weekend in Iowa, the governor was able to capitalise on widespread
disaffection for President Bush, whose heavy-handed largesse - particularly
an announcement of Dollars 1bn in export subsidies, which came too late in
the growing season for the benefit of most farmers - and reluctance to
retaliate against the protectionism of the European Community has left him
vulnerable.
Mr Clinton promised farmers what all candidates must - higher prices - to be
achieved through 'decent supply management' and 'a vigorous opportunity to
export'.
'We can do better than corn (maize) and soyabean prices going down,' he
said. 'We can do better than declining farm incomes and better than a Farm
Bill that has been mismanaged by people who never wanted to see it work.'
More importantly, his support for ethanol came at a time when - to the
disgust of farm lobbyists - the White House is torn by indecision over
demands for the inclusion of ethanol in a federal programme requiring the
use of cleaner fuels in the nation's smoggiest cities. Its inclusion could
give a big boost to a struggling industry, raise demand for maize and
decrease American dependence on imported oil.
Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency says ethanol emits
chemicals which contribute to smog, and the oil industry - with its many
Bush backers - has joined forces with environmentalists against ethanol.
While the White House remained unable to resolve its dilemma, Mr Clinton
promised to find a way to use ethanol 'as a part of our nation's energy
security future.' An adviser in his campaign said additives could be used to
blunt the effect of ethanol on smog.
Without actually saying that he would retaliate over the EC's oilseed
subsidy - a case farmers view as having dragged on for years too long - the
governor indicated that foreign policy considerations would not stop him
from imposing sanctions to open markets.
'Trade barriers cost our oilseed producers Dollars 2bn,' he said. 'The law
today gives George Bush the weapons he needs to level the playing field, but
he always puts them in mothballs.' He also took aim at the EC for its ban on
US pork 'on the flimsiest of excuse' and the president's early failure to
approve export subsidies for pork to Russia.
He vowed support for biotechnology to develop products made from US-grown
commodities - biodegradable plastics, soyabean-based inks, industrial oils,
lubricants and biofuels. 'We can drive up incomes and profits for decades to
come and create businesses that will stay in smaller communities,' he said,
'if we have a little vision and the kind of research and development and
technology-spreading we need.'

London robusta COFFEE prices ended mixed. Dealers attributed the lack of
business partly to unwillingness to trade during the ICO talks which were
due to end late yesterday. 'I think it's generally quiet but just in case
any miracle did happen (at the talks), people weren't going to do a great
deal,' one said. New York arabicas had recovered some of Tuesday's losses in
late trading. On the LME the premium for cash ZINC over three-month metal
widened to Dollars 12.50 a tonne as the market recovered some of this week's
losses. COPPER prices remained easier this afternoon although the market
consolidated above the three-month lows of Dollars 2,344 a tonne for
three-month metal set earlier. Support is expected around Dollars 2,340 but
the market appears to have limited upside potential. Comex copper prices
were in retreat at midday. One trader pointed out that Comex stocks are at a
five-year high of 51,025 short tons (2,000 lbs) and LME stocks are at the
highest level since April. NICKEL continued to ease, with the market unable
to build on earlier gains. However, there was underlying support from
uncertainty over producer intentions.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mystery over gold market glitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING STRANGE is going on in the gold market but, as usual in this
secretive business, no-one is admitting responsibility.
The indication that all is not normal is that the cost of leasing gold has
risen sharply, traders say to the highest level for 18 months.
The last time something similar happened to the leasing rate it later
emerged that Portugal's central bank had lost 288,000 troy ounces of the
precious metal, then worth about USDollars 100m, which had been lent to
Drexel Burnham Lambert, the financial services group that collapsed in 1990.
According to the Reuter news agency, the present glitch might have been
caused by a very big central bank unexpectedly taking back from the market
1.4m ounces (about 43.5 tonnes) of gold. This represents about 5 per cent of
the pool of 800 tonnes of gold which some analysts suggest is usually
available to the market.
Central banks and other financial institutions lend gold to the market in
order to earn a very modest return on an asset that otherwise would yield no
interest.
They swap gold (sell with a commitment to buy it back again at an agreed
price and date) with commercial banks and other intermediaries who take a
commission before passing it on to clients such as gold producers or
jewellers.
The system has facilitated the forward selling by gold producers that some
analysts suggest has been putting a 'cap' on any price rise.
Usually central banks roll over these loans to the market but the Reuter
report suggests that one bank decided to take back its gold instead.
Traders say demand for leased gold is being stimulated at present by
Australian producers selling forward because the price in Australian dollars
has been rising, reflecting a strengthening of the US dollar.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, recalled that in
1990 at the time of Portugal's embarrasment, lease rates were kept down
because Russia had gold to lend. 'The implication is that today there is no
spare metal to lend which is notable. But we will have to see how long lease
rates stay up to see if something really important is happening in the gold
market.'

THE WESTERN world's aluminium industry needs to build 13 new smelters
costing about Dollars 1bn each by the year 2002 if it is to keep pace with
expected growth in demand, according to Mr Harry Helton, executive vice
president, metals and raw materials, at Reynolds Metals, the second-largest
of the US aluminium groups.
However, the industry is being forced by the present low level of prices on
the world aluminium market to delay starting work on new smelting capacity
and this might lead to a very tight supply situation at the end of the
1990s.
Mr Helton explained: 'We can't go to shareholders and ask for a new smelter
until we can see a sustained upswing in the aluminium price'.
The industry needed to see a sustained price of 80 cents to 85 cents a lb
(Dollars 1,763 to Dollars 1,873 a tonne) before it could reasonably start
investing again, he said, adding: 'That price would not scare our
customers'.
Last night aluminium for delivery in three months time closed on the London
Metal Exchange at Dollars 1,272 a tonne.
Mr Helton said that the Reynolds estimate of future aluminium needs was
based on an assumption that annual demand for the metal from fabricators
would grow at 2 per cent. It took no account of those forecasts that
suggested a big upsurge in the use of aluminium in cars, nor did it assume
any substantial drop in metal imports from the Commonwealth of Independent
States. It also took account of the much faster growth in the use of
recycled (scrap) aluminium compared with primary metal.
Reynolds last year temporarily closed its Troutdale smelter in Oregon, which
can produce 171,000 tonnes a year, because of low prices, forced down mainly
by an unexpected surge in aluminium exports from Russia. Mr Helton said
Reynolds would restart Troutdale 'as soon as we see a sustained (upward)
move on the demand side.'
The company is involved in two smelter projects outside North America. Mr
Randolph Reynolds, executive vice president, international, said a
controversial scheme in Nigeria 'is coming along slowly'.
The Nigerian government is financing the whole of the DM2.4bn (Dollars
1.66bn) project, which includes a power plant and residential accommodation
as well as an aluminium smelter. Reynolds has an 11 per cent interest in the
smelter, is providing its technology and is committed to selling 140,000
tonnes of production a year.
'We are being very cautious and making sure the money is available before
making any move,' said Mr Reynolds.
The target for start-up of the 180,000 tonnes a year Nigerian smelter is
early 1994. It will be managed by Reynolds in co-operation with Ferrostaal,
a subsidiary of MAN, the German engineering and steel group, which is
leading the project.
Mr Reynolds said that a joint-venture project between Mitsubishi of Japan
and Reynolds for a 190,000 tonnes a year smelter in Venezuela had been
shelved temporarily.
He added: 'Venezuela is an excellent place to build a smelter so we are
still interested. But, because of market conditions, it is not being given
our highest priority. The (Venezuelan) government understands'.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Unrelieved pressure on dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR lost more than a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, as
investors became nervous about the release of tomorrow's non-farm payroll
figure in the US, writes James Blitz.
The market seems convinced that the August figure, which is regarded by many
as the most important indicator of the state of the US economy, will be
weak. Mr Jim O' Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in
London, believes that it will register a monthly drop of 110,000. But it is
a very difficult figure to predict, because of the impact of the US summer
jobs programme on the data.
A particularly poor figure could be followed by a cut in the Federal
Reserve's discount rate, widening the differential between US and German
rates, and forcing the dollar down further. In anticipation of this, the
dollar closed in Europe at DM1.4135, after hitting a low of DM1.4040.
Several London-based dealers said that the dollar was being sold by major
institutional players, as well as the banks.
The dollar will probably be supported tomorrow if the Bundesbank delivers
another cut in short-term interest rates at its council meeting. The
arguments against a cut seem strong, but they are being ignored by many in
the market. 'Nearly half the dealers believe that there will be a cut in
rates,' said one analyst yesterday, 'and if there isn't, there will be
intense disappointment.'
In this atmosphere, the weaker European currencies suffered. There was
another run on the Italian lira in Europe, with the currency losing 5.8 per
cent of its value against the D-Mark as it touched L900. It later closed at
L876. Fears of the imposition of a deposits tax by the Bank of Italy
triggered the currency's decline. According to several analysts, the sellers
were Italian depositors not international banks.
The lira's fall undermined sterling, as investors recalled that the last
heavy fall on the lira was the curtain-raiser to 'Black Wednesday.' Sterling
touched a historic low of DM2.50 in Europe, but later rebounded to close at
DM2.5175.
The currency's fate is in the hands of the German and American central banks
tomorrow. If their interest rate differential widens, Mr O'Neill expects the
pound to visit DM1.45. The UK's foreign reserves figure, due out tomorrow,
could also be market-sensitive, with forecasts of the drop in reserves
ranging between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 18bn because of uncertainty over the
extent of the Bank of England's recent intervention.
The French franc closed at FFr3.384 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.3810.
Speculators have lost money as the franc escapes the peril of devaluation,
and another assault on the currency is unlikely.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Rates close firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in both the sterling cash and futures markets was thin yesterday,
even though the currency fell to a new low of DM2.50 against the D-Mark in
the day's trading.
In the absence of any clearly formulated UK government policy, sterling
seems fundamentally weak. But the money markets are still being buffeted by
different indications on whether another base rate cut is in the offing.
On Tuesday, the Governor of the Bank of England suggested that sterling
would have to retain some kind of exchange rate target, implying that the
Chancellor could not cut rates with impunity. Mr Lothar Muller, a Bundesbank
Council member, also suggested that there would not be another cut in German
rates for another six months. Both statements would have made dealers
bearish about the prospects for another UK base rate cut.
Others cling to the view that there could be base rate cut at next week's
conservative conference to boost the standing of the government in general.
'I think it would be wrong to rule out a cut,' said one discount house
dealer.
One argument in favour of a cut is the continuing presure in the European
exchange rate mechanism. Although the French franc was still comfortably
hovering at around FFr3.38 against the D-Mark yesterday, well above its
floor, the French government is still unable to meet the commitment it made
to cut French rates if France voted Yes to the Maastricht treaty in its
referendum.
December French franc futures yesterday tumbled from 90.90 to a low of
90.37, reflecting fears that the currency may yet weaken. This may put more
pressure on the Bundesbank to cut rates tomorrow.
In the sterling cash market, 3-month money closed at 9 1/16 per cent on the
offered side,  1/8 per cent up on the previous close. One-month money
remained unchanged at 9 1/4 per cent offered. In the futures, December
sterling closed unchanged at 91.78.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m at the start of its
operations. In early operations, it bought Pounds 500m of Band 1 bank bills
at 8 7/8 per cent and 210m in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent.
The forecast was then revised to Pounds 700m.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bank's shares in a state of flux
 -Another stake in Ambroveneto is up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shake-up at Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest
private-sector bank, seems certain following this week's confirmation that a
second big stake is up for sale.
Gemina, the investment and financial services group controlled by Fiat,
wants to dispose of a 13.5 per cent holding. Its decision follows the news
that a group of four co-operative banks from the Veneto region of northern
Italy, which together form one of the five members of the shareholders' pool
controlling Ambroveneto, also want to pull out.
Other constituents of the pool include Crediop, the big Rome-based bank
bought last year by Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, and Credit
Agricole of France. Each member owns about 13 per cent of Ambroveneto, and
has a right of first refusal on any stakes that come on offer.
The fact that Gemina wants to sell its shareholding, at the same L6,500
(Dollars 5.51) price per share being sought by the Veneto banks for their
13.6 per cent stake, means that more than a quarter of Ambroveneto's shares
are in a state of flux.
The price demanded values the two packets of shares at about L415bn - more
than twice the current stock market level.
The premium reflects the rare opportunity to buy into a bank which has
changed unrecognisably since the 1982 collapse of its predecessor and the
mysterious death of its chairman, Mr Roberto Calvi.
Ambroveneto, which has just announced a 5.6 per cent rise in gross operating
profits to L336.6bn in the first half of this year, is one of Italy' most
successful and best-run banks. Buoyed by acquisitions and a rapidly growing
branch network, deposits rose by 11.6 per cent to L16,923bn, while loans
jumped by 16.3 per cent to L16,541bn, excluding Ambroveneto Sud, the
Naples-based bank bought from Citibank, and only consolidated from July
1991.
Surprisingly, Ambroveneto's share price has been relatively stable, in spite
of the growing uncertainty about its future. The explanation lies in the
rules of the shareholders' pact and Italy's complex new takeover code.
The stock market believes that the shares on offer will probably be
redistributed within the pool, rather than offered to a potential raider. If
both stakes were to be purchased by an existing member of the pact, the
resultant holding of almost 40 per cent would be still insufficient to
trigger a compulsory bid under the new takeover rules.
Both Crediop and Credit Agricole have said they are interested in increasing
their holdings. Crediop's owner, San Paolo, now cash-rich following its
L1,525bn flotation earlier this year, may see Crediop as a stalking horse
for eventually gaining full control over Ambroveneto.
The bank would ideally complement San Paolo's existing branch network, which
is heavily weighted towards its native region of Piedmont in north-western
Italy, whereas Ambroveneto is strongest in Lombardy and the Veneto.
Credit Agricole may also have its eyes on the bank. A number of big French
banks have been moving into Italy as a prime target for future growth.
Credit Lyonnais controls Credito Bergamasco, a successful north Italian
regional bank, while Banque Nationale de Paris has a small share in
Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo.
However, both potential acquirers could face opposition from the Bank of
Italy. The central bank may be reluctant to see control of the country's
biggest private sector bank passing to San Paolo, which is still largely in
public sector hands. Regulators may also be unwilling to accept a transfer
of ownership to a foreign institution at a time when they are still trying
to encourage the domestic concentration through mergers between Italian
banks.
Such considerations have increased the difficulties facing Mr Giovanni
Bazoli, Ambroveneto's chairman, who has successfully managed to keep up the
shareholders' pact through past upsets.
Failing a purchase by either Crediop or Credit Agricole, the two stakes
could be offered to outsiders. Mr Bazoli has long been considering a
cross-marketing pact with an insurance company, which might be invited into
the shareholders' pool to seal the relationship.
Alleanza, the life insurance subsidiary of Italy's Generali group, has long
been tipped as a possible candidate, partly because Generali, though not a
pool member, owns over 5 per cent of Ambroveneto's shares.
Alternatively, Mr Bazoli may be looking for a new foreign partner. A number
of names have been mentioned. But why any non-Italian bank should want to
pay twice the bourse price for a minority stake in a company in which
another foreign institution is well entrenched is less clear.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Montedison plunges into L188bn
loss in first half

<TEXT>
MONTEDISON, the Italian chemicals, energy and agro-industrial group
controlled by the Ferruzzi Finanziaria holding company, plunged into a
first-half loss of L188bn (Dollars 159m) compared with net profits of L108bn
in the same period last year. Before tax and minority interests, Montedison
showed a profit of L45bn.
Group earnings have been under pressure. However, extraordinary items have
traditionally played an important role in lifting earnings. The company did
not reveal what, if any, income had derived from extraordinary items this
year, but said the total was less than the L350bn in one-off gains last
time.
Montedison's results suffered from its continuing predilection for
acquisitions and heavy investments at a time of recession, notably in
chemicals.
Meanwhile, long-awaited disposals under its declared policy of concentrating
on core businesses have not materialised. The company said earnings had
temporarily gone 'out of phase'.
Group borrowings grew by 24.5 per cent to L8,092bn from L6,499bn, while
sales rose by 8 per cent to L7,562bn. Gross operating profits rose by 6 per
cent to L932bn. About L1,100bn of the rise in debt stemmed from
acquisitions, with deals in France, Italy and Hungary.
Substantial extraordinary earnings could arise from last month's plastics
joint venture with Shell, which should remove some debt from Montedison's
balance sheet.
Ferruzzi Finanziaria, meanwhile, reported a first-half consolidated net
profit of L20bn, down from L83bn a year ago. Consolidated turnover totalled
L9,620bn, against L8,630bn last time.
Gross operating profit rose to L1,040bn from L970bn. Group net debt at the
end of the half-year amounted to L10,720bn against L8,200bn a year earlier.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group,
yesterday reported a 20 per cent rise in first-half net profits, mainly due
to exceptional gains, and forecast higher earnings for the year as a whole.
Net income climbed to FFr3.1bn (Dollars 615m) in the first six months of
this year, from FFr2.6bn in the same period of 1991, on sales up by 6 per
cent to FFr79.47bn.
Most of the rise in net income is due to a FFr437m capital gain on the sale
of Treasury stock. Operating profits, by contrast, fell by 3 per cent to
FFr6.34bn.
This was 'satisfactory in view of the current economic climate', said the
group.
It blamed the slight drop in operating income on depressed conditions in the
market for private telephone equipment and the fact that some recent
acquisitions, such as Rockwell International's transmission systems business
and Canada Wire, a cable supplier, were less profitable than the group norm.
A temporary reduction in Spain's telephone equipment investment programme
hit operating profits, said the group.
On average, Alcatel Alsthom's subsidiaries produced a 5 per cent net return
on turnover, the company said.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 8 per cent over the period to
FFr24.70.

</HEADLINE>

   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANCA Commerciale Italiana (BCI) and Credito Italiano, the two big Italian
banks owned by the Iri state holding company, reported differing results for
the first half of this year.
BCI said six-month earnings before taxes, depreciation and provisions, but
after extraordinary items, rose by 5.4 per cent to L601.5bn (Dollars 510m).
However, operating earnings remained virtually static at L565.2bn.
Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth-largest bank, which is due to be privatised
shortly, reported a 19 per cent fall in gross operating profits to L405bn
from L503bn.
Credito Italiano blamed the setback on its expansion programme, with the
acquisition of stakes in smaller regional banks and a sharp rise in its
branch network, and difficulties in the government bond market.
Higher interest earnings thanks to rising domestic interest rates should
partly compensate for the problems on the bond side.
Interest earnings at BCI rose by 7.2 per cent to L1,283bn in the first half,
while fee income declined by L2.5bn to L526.8bn.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: BM inches ahead to Pounds 34.6m but lifts
pay-out by 47%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL profits inched ahead at BM Group, the construction equipment and
engineering concern which saw its share price fall by three quarters this
summer after the departure of its chairman.
BM made Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 34m) pre-tax in the year to June 30 on turnover
of Pounds 519m (Pounds 396m).
Although fully diluted earnings per share fell by 14 per cent to 23.4p
(27.2p), the total dividend has been increased 47 per cent to 5p (3.4p)
after a final of 2.9p (1.8p).
The share price shed 15p to close at 91p.
The company also announced yesterday, Mr Moger Woolley was taking over as
chairman. He spent most of his career at DRG, the packaging group.
The figures included a full-year, as opposed to an eight-month, contribution
from Blackwood Hodge, construction equipment distributor.
Thomas Robinson, the engineering group that proved to be Mr Roger Shute's
last big deal before he resigned on health grounds, was included for four
months, chipping in Pounds 2.6m profit and Pounds 52m sales.
Distribution, including Blackwood Hodge, increased sales by Pounds 79m to
Pounds 337m. But profit, after interest, slipped to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds
17.7m). Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, said margins had been eroded in
the UK. The US was patchy, while demand from Australian mines remained
resilient.
In construction equipment manufacture, UK activities had struggled. Mustang
in the US had a successful year and Austoft, maker of sugar cane harvesting
equipment, had fallen back in Australia. The division made Pounds 4.4m
(Pounds 4.2m) profit.
Other manufacturing businesses made Pounds 7.69m (Pounds 5.01m) on Pounds
86.1m (Pounds 40.8m) sales.
Group operating profit rose to Pounds 43m (Pounds 42.4m) before property
gains of Pounds 919,000 (Pounds 325,000) and exceptional gains of Pounds
316,000 (Pounds 1.41m).
Interest costs were Pounds 9.74m (Pounds 10.4m) and net debt Pounds 61.1m
(Pounds 90.3m). Gearing was 36 per cent, helped by the Pounds 60m rights
issue linked to the Robinson buy.
COMMENT
Mr Shute used to say BM was a tortoise, not a hare. Yet it tried to be the
latter as a deal-oriented growth company. Since the departure of the
hard-driving Shute, the largely unchanged management would gladly settle at
last for a tortoise. Whatever the animal, some analysts are unhappy. BM's
aim of 'above average earnings per share growth' looks incongruous now the
company accepts it cannot buck recession in its markets. The sceptics also
point to acquisition provisions which still amount to about Pounds 11m.
Dividend cover would quickly fall below three times if earnings weakened. A
pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 30m, including an extra Pounds 4m from
Robinson, gives a prospective p/e of five. This looks cheap, but the
restoration of credibility could take years. Meanwhile the 7 per cent-plus
yield gives some support and dividend growth prospects do look reasonable.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCHANAN Partners, the London-based investment firm, is attempting to
organise a voluntary winding-up of Malaysian Smaller Companies Fund
(Cayman).
MSCF is a closed-end investment company, similar to an investment trust,
with a net asset value estimated by Buchanan at Dollars 40m. It invests in
Malaysian smaller companies.
Buchanan and related accounts now have an aggregate 10.27 per cent holding
in MSCF's ordinary shares, and they are requisitioning an extraordinary
meeting to wind up the company.
According to Buchanan: 'We have a very strong confirmation that shareholders
representing a further 61.73 per cent in the ordinary shares will support
the resolution. At the present time we are very confident that the
resolution would be passed.'
Shares in single-country funds are only infrequently traded, and so
discounts to net asset value are often substantial. The aim of a voluntary
liquidation would be to allow shareholders to realise assets in the fund, at
a discount.
A two-thirds majority is required. Buchanan says the liquidators' fee would
not exceed Dollars 25,000, and that distribution of assets and cash could
take place within two months of winding-up.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland slips 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF Scotland yesterday warned that it was continuing to suffer from
substantial losses on loans and was doubtful there would be any improvement
in the rest of the year.
The gloomy prediction was made as Scotland's second biggest bank disclosed
that pre-tax profits in the six months to August 31 were Pounds 74.2m, some
2 per cent down on the comparable Pounds 75.7m.
The provision to cover actual and possible losses on bad and doubtful debts
was Pounds 138m, up from Pounds 121m in 1991. Though the charge was high
given the bank's record, it was running at a lower level as a proportion of
loans than the charges of the four English clearing banks.
Mr Peter Burt, chief general manager, said his bank's bad debts were
probably less severe than rivals' because it had a relatively small lending
exposure in the south of England, where borrowers were having the worst
problems.
It also bucked the trend of the English banks by increasing the volume of
loans it made. Its sterling loan book rose by 7 per cent, while its
competitors' loan books have been shrinking or stagnating.
Most of the loan growth came from an increase in its home mortgage business.
However, the bank also lifted its share of the declining small business loan
market, according to Mr Burt.
Fees and commissions earned by its main banking operation rose 18 per cent
to Pounds 115.3m. 'We are getting much better at collecting charges', Mr
Burt explained.
Apart from the bad debt provision, the bank's profits were also depressed by
a further Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m in interest which was owed to the bank
but not paid. Its net interest earnings were also hit by 'upward pressure'
on the average cost of deposits.
The bank pointed out that although bank base rates had been falling this
year, they had been below money market rates. Deposit rates were often
directly or indirectly linked to money market rates.
However, the bank said that the return or margin it made from lending in
underlying terms, excluding exceptional factors, continued to improve.
Mr Burt said that a month ago he thought the bad debt charge would continue
to rise in the coming months. Following sterling's withdrawal from the
Exchange Rate Mechanism and the subsequent fall in base rates, he was now
hopeful that bad debts would stabilise.
But he added: 'There will not be an improvement till the economy improves.
There are no encouraging signs. . . Thank God we are out of the ERM'.
Earnings per share were 3.2p (3.6p) and the interim dividend is lifted to
1.77p (1.7p).

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gold price and drought take toll on Cluff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Cluff Resources, the gold mining group, fell another 15 per cent,
to 11 1/2 p, yesterday after it revealed a 26 per cent fall in first-half
profits and warned that its two operating mines faced a tough second half
because of the severe drought in Zimbabwe.
Pre-tax profit to the end of June fell from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 802,000
on turnover reduced from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 6.97m, because of low gold
prices - the metal has been trading in sterling terms at its lowest level
for 13 years - and the higher value of sterling against the dollar.
Gold production in the half-year, mainly from Freda Rebecca, Zimbabwe's
biggest gold mine, increased from 34,548 to 35,625 troy ounces in spite of
the country's widespread difficulties from the effects of drought.
Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said the Zimbabwe government had been forced to
impose a 25 per cent cut in power supplies because of the lack of water and
gold output might suffer by at least that amount if cuts continued.
Even if the rains came next month, power would be a problem for six to eight
months.
Mr Cluff said Zimbabwe was also 'taking the medicine prescribed by the
International Monetary Fund' and was vigorously attempting to reduce
inflation. This had required interest rates to be set at just under 50 per
cent.
Although Cluff's debt was low - gearing was 15 per cent - this was having an
adverse impact. Also, the company would need to borrow some money for the
Peach Tree Mine near Bulawayo, which is scheduled to start up next month.

Ramco Oil Services, the Aberdeen-based oil services company which is seeking
opportunities in the former Soviet Union, recorded an 11 per cent rise in
interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 250,000, in difficult conditions, writes
Wallton Morais.
Turnover in the six months to June 30 rose sharply to Pounds 2.87m (Pounds
1.89m). Earnings per share were static at 0.95p (0.94p), and there was again
no interim dividend.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Recession and weak dollar push Hogg down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION, tough conditions in the reinsurance market and the weakness of
the US dollar combined to depress pre-tax profits at Hogg Group, the
insurance broker, to Pounds 6.8m for the half year to June 30 compared with
Pounds 8.26m.
Earnings per share were 20 per cent lower at 6p (7.52p). The dividend is
maintained at 3.15p per share.
The result, which was broadly in line with expectations, produced a positive
response from the market and the shares were marked up 14p to close at 131p.
Turnover from broking rose to Pounds 56.1m (Pounds 55.9m) and by an
underlying rate of 3.2 per cent.
However, the group was hit by tough conditions in the London reinsurance
market, as well as in the UK credit insurance and political risk insurance
markets in which it specialises.
Income from the London retrocession (reinsurance of reinsurance) market fell
by Pounds 750,000, while that from credit and political broking dropped by a
further Pounds 600,000.
Mr James Vaughn, chairman, said that recession had depressed the turnover of
many companies buying credit insurance, reducing premium volume and the size
of commissions earned by Hogg.
In addition, Hogg was feeling the effect of a cut in commission rates
introduced last year by Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurer, with
which it places significant amounts of business.
The effect of the weaker dollar (41.17 per cent of Hogg's income comes from
the United States) and the strength of sterling against other overseas
currencies cut income by another Pounds 750,000.
Expenses rose to Pounds 53.1m (Pounds 51.7m) and by an underlying rate of 5
per cent. UK expenses increased by 8.5 per cent against turnover of 7.9 per
cent. US expenses fell by 2.1 per cent against a turnover reduction of 3 per
cent.
The increase was attributed to costs arising from the development of new
business, as well as redundancy payments and restructuring expenses.
Despite the increase in costs staff numbers were down overall by 1 per cent.
UK staff numbers were flat, while US staff numbers fell by 5 per cent.
Lower interest rates (down by 20 per cent in the UK and by 35 per cent in
the United States) reduced investment income to Pounds 2.63 (Pounds 2.94m)
after taking into account interest payable.
The share of profits from associated companies remained unchanged at Pounds
1.13m.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Disposal losses leave Tuskar IPounds 31m in
red

<TEXT>
TUSKAR RESOURCES, the Dublin-based oil and gas exploration company suffered
pre-tax losses of IPounds 30.8m (Pounds 32.3m) for the year ending March 31
1992, almost quadrupling its previous year's losses of IPounds 8.1m.
Some IPounds 27m of the losses, or 90 per cent, are the result of the
disposal last August of the company's Colombian oilfield interests to Coplex
Resources, an Australian exploration company, for IPounds 5.6m in a cash and
share deal.
Mr Duncan McGregor, who recently replaced Mr Neil O'Donoghue as Tuskar's
chairman, explained that the loss was due to deferred exploration
expenditure in the Rubiales oilfield in Colombia which had been held in the
books. That loss was realised upon disposal of the field to Coplex, he said.
In its 1991 annual report, the company reported a total of IPounds 29.5m
deferred expenditure relating to its Colombian exploration licences.
A further IPounds 1.23m has been written off in exploration expenditure,
primarily in the UK and Turkey and there was a IPounds 1.29m loss on the
sale of its investment in Tuskar (Texas).
In April this year, Tuskar entered into a share-swap deal with Coplex to
dispose of 54 per cent of its Colombian acreage, following a takeover bid by
Coplex. The bid was rejected by shareholders, and led to the revised deal
under which all of Tuskar's interests in the Piriales field were sold in
August to Coplex. The company's shares, which trade on the USM, were then
suspended at 1p.
Losses per share increased to 11.71p (4.06p).

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Blockleys profit and interim cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Blockleys, maker of bricks and paviors, is cutting the interim dividend from
1.95p to 0.5p as pre-tax profits were halved from Pounds 852,000 to Pounds
410,000 for the six months ended June 30.
The group said there was, as yet, no prospect of any significant improvement
in construction activity. Measures had been taken to reduce further its
production this year by some 10 per cent.
In the first half sales volume showed a 'reasonable improvement', but
turnover slipped from Pounds 5.39m to Pounds 5.15m. Sales in the second half
were not expected to increase over last year although sales of paviors,
particularly to Germany, had grown rapidly to around 30 per cent of pavior
sales.
Earnings per share were down to 0.99p (2.3p).

<TEXT>
Despite poor conditions in most of its markets, Sykes Pickavant Group lifted
sales 9 per cent and pre-tax profit 33 per cent in the half year ended June
30 1992.
The group makes hand tools and diagnostics equipment. Turnover came to
Pounds 9.41m (Pounds 8.65m), operating surplus to Pounds 550,000 (Pounds
463,000) and the pre-tax balance to Pounds 402,000 (Pounds 302,000).
Mr Ray Way, chairman, said all the sales growth was achieved in the
automobile and industrial businesses; sales in Vitrex continued to be
depressed as a result of poor conditions in the DIY market.
Earnings per share rose to 2.75p (2.12p) and the interim dividend is again
2.25p.

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps BLP back to profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing efforts to cut costs and develop new business opportunities
helped BLP Group, the USM-quoted maker of wood laminates and mouldings, to
move back into the black in the first half of 1992, albeit with a small
profit of Pounds 1,000.
The company warned however, that trading conditions had been very difficult,
and it would be 'unrealistic' to expect second half results to match those
of the first.
The interim profit compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 261,000 last time,
which included results of Berg Mantelprofilwerk of Germany up to its
disposal in June, 1991.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 28m to Pounds 11.5m, while interest charges
were cut to Pounds 81,000 (Pounds 403,000) reflecting the cashflow benefits
of the Berg sale and positive cash generation by the businesses.
Losses per share were 2.3p (5.3p). There is again no interim dividend.

Although pre-tax profit at EW Fact fell 15.4 per cent in the first half, it

Birkby, which reversed into Finlan Group in August, yesterday announced that
Finlan's pre-tax losses for the year to March 31 were Pounds 4.55m. Losses
previously were Pounds 15.7m.
Mr Michael Woodhead, the chairman, said that as the results covered the last
full year of Finlan they bore little relation to the current group.
He pointed out that Birkby was a profitable rental group and achieved
pre-tax profits of Pounds 600,000 for the year to July 31. It specialises in
the provision of managed rental workspace mainly in converted mills along
the M62 corridor, commercial vehicle hire and instalment credit.
Finlan's turnover fell from Pounds 49.3m to Pounds 19.5m and the pre-tax
result was after exceptional debits of Pounds 685,000 (Pounds 2.68m). Losses
per share were 1.3p (7.1p).

FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Metropolitan to omit final
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Metropolitan Property, the property investment company, yesterday
said it would not be able to pay a final dividend in spite of its earlier
stated intention to maintain last year's total of 4.4p.
The shares fell 8p before recovering to close 2p lower at 24p.
The board, which met on Tuesday, decided it was not prudent to pay a final
dividend in light of what one of its advisers described as 'extraordinary
economic circumstances'.
Although the company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 840,000 for the half
year to February 15 and cut its interim dividend to 1.5p (2.53p) it said at
the time that it intended to maintain the total dividend at 4.4p.
A statement from the company said: 'Confidence following the General
Election result was short-lived and in recent months property investment and
letting markets have shown marked deterioration, resulting in a further
decline in values.'
Net asset value per share is expected to have fallen from 145p per share to
114p as at August 15, when the company publishes its full year results at
the end of October.
The company said it remained ahead of target with property sales and debt
reduction and would show an improved revenue performance in the second half.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): An impeachable
source for TV promotions - The growing cult of 'opportunity advertising' in
Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'And how do you explain all these assets?' demands the stern-faced
interrogator, one of a bench of men looking down sceptically at the nervous
witness.
To Brazilians, the scene is familiar, recalling the much televised inquiry
into government corruption which resulted in a congressional vote on Tuesday
in favour of impeaching President Fernando Collor.
But this 30-second scene on peak-time TV has a twist. 'I made it with Banco
Boavista', says the witness. 'Honestly it's the best way to make money.'
This is the most visible example of what Brazilian advertisers call
'opportunity advertising' - taking advantage of a news event to promote a
product. Currently the most popular themes in advertising in Brazil -
government corruption and the impeachment of the president - are being used
to sell everything from bank accounts and language classes to stockings and
amusement parks.
The rush by merchandisers to out-do rivals is giving the Brazilian
advertising industry a new boom during otherwise lean times. The first
agency to seize on the theme was W/Brasil. Back in May when the corruption
allegations were first laid against Collor by his younger brother, Pedro -
forcing the family matriarch, Dona Leda, to intervene  - Washington
Olivetto, who runs W/Brasil, could not resist the opportunity.
Within days he produced an advertisement for a video game which ran: 'Dona
Leda. Give a Mastersystem to the boys and stop them squabbling.' He
explains: 'The opportunity ad is something we use a lot. We want our ads to
be as up-to-date as the news. In Brazil, this means we have to react very
fast because things change so quickly.'
Other agencies soon caught on to the idea, particularly as the fraternal
feud and subsequent corruption inquiry reached soap opera proportions.
One of the most common references in marketing slogans has been to the
so-called 'phantom' bank accounts, allegedly used to transfer money to the
president from the scheme's front man, Paulo Cesar Farias, known as PC.
'Come and meet the phantoms of PC, the best loved in Brazil. Playcentre, the
PC which admits to its phantoms.' This advertisement for an amusement park
was so successful that on a recent Saturday, it attracted 22,000 children
and had to close its doors because it was full.
Even Pedro Collor's glamorous wife, Maria Thereza, has been involved since
she rose to fame defending her husband against allegations that he was
mentally imbalanced. Nastrotec has seen a 20 per cent increase in sales of
its Flow Lady stockings since commissioning a film by the agency Lew Lara
Propeg which shows a man talking about the quality of Flow. Suddenly a pair
of stunning legs appears and the man starts repeating women's names until he
settles dreamily on Maria Thereza.
Jacques Lewkowicz, the creator, explains: 'When there is not enough money
for a big, prolonged campaign, there is nothing better than taking advantage
of an event to draw the consumer's interest.'
Luis Roberto Pires from the Contemporanea agency which produced the
advertisements for Banco Boavista, agrees. 'For us, the corruption inquiry
was a perfect chance to focus attention on a reputation that Boavista
already had - that of honesty.'
Olivetto says the trend for corruption-related advertisements has come as a
godsend at an otherwise difficult moment when political and economic
uncertainty on top of two years of recession means that planning is on hold
while everyone waits to see what will happen next
Perhaps the most popular theme has been impeachment since the country's
first ever impeachment process was started. 'Impeachment. Learn other
interesting English words. Stop by Inlingua,' reads the billboard for
English lessons in the southern city of Porto Allegre, taking advantage of
the fact that there is no Brazilian word for impeachment. The slogan was so
successful that the classes sold out almost immediately and new teachers had
to be contracted.
Despite the current proliferation of corruption-related advertisements,
Olivetto predicts their popularity will soon pale. 'We're avoiding ads on
the theme because everyone is using them, so they are losing impact. We're
waiting now for the next event.' In the meantime at least one sector is
benefiting from the crisis.

AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY: RIGHT AT THE CENTRE By Cecil Parkinson Weidenfeld &amp;
Nicolson Pounds 18.99 312 pages
In Lady Thatcher's Tory party Cecil (now Lord) Parkinson stood almost
exactly between Norman Tebbit and Michael Heseltine, two men with whom his
paths crossed frequently and sometimes ran together. Parkinson was better
off and more formally educated than Tebbit and therefore lacked the Tebbit
abrasiveness. But he was considerably less well off than Heseltine and
therefore lacked the latter's independence.
Parkinson was also a curious mixture of the flamboyant and the banal. It is
an exaggeration to have called this book an autobiography for, although it
has interesting parts, much of it is outstandingly dull. About half of it
consists of rather tedious accounts of what he did as a minister, the
implication being that there was little life outside the office. Those
looking for revelations will fail to find them.
There are, however, two striking sections. The first concerns his feelings
about Margaret Thatcher, whom he admired beyond the call of duty. The second
is about his early days before he chose politics. The fall of the prime
minister, as she then was, occupies the first 50 pages and must have been
one of the main reasons for writing the book.
Parkinson was one of the few cabinet ministers to support her to the end.
The others were Kenneth Baker and Peter Brooke. He quotes her as saying that
it was not the challenge of Heseltine that brought her down; it was, in her
own words, 'the cabinet'. He then proceeds to bear this out.
When Mrs Thatcher narrowly failed to win on the first ballot, the bulk of
the cabinet decided that she must go and - of equal importance - that
Heseltine should not be the successor. That was why both John Major and
Douglas Hurd were put up against him - to split the Heseltine vote.
Parkinson argues that she had almost seen it coming.
His theory goes that she was preparing yet again to create a cabinet in her
own image. She was unable to do that when she became prime minister in 1979
because she inherited too many 'consensus' rather than 'conviction'
colleagues. She started to change the balance with her first cabinet
sackings in 1981 and by bringing in people such as Parkinson and Tebbit. Yet
the new parliamentary intake goes in cycles. Many able Tories who entered
the House of Commons in 1979, such as John and Christopher Patten, were not
Thatcherites, but in due course had to be promoted on merit. The balance was
thus swinging against her until she could bring forward the more
convictionist intake of 1983, such as Francis Maude, Michael Forsyth and
Michael Portillo. Time ran out.
Parkinson is a good political analyst and one is inclined to take his theory
seriously. He was also an excellent party chairman. Compare his smooth
success in helping to win the general election of 1983 with the quarrels
that went on when the Tories won much more acrimoniously in 1987.
Perhaps his background helped. His father was a 'Bevin boy' who went down
the mines because he was too old for the war and subsequently worked on the
railways. Cecil was a young recruit to the Labour party and sometimes
attended communist rallies. Although his socialism had ebbed before he went
to Cambridge, he still tended to look down on what came to be called the
'Cambridge mafia' in the Heath, Thatcher and Major cabinets.
He was offered a place at Emmanuel College on the assumption that he would
read divinity, but switched to English literature which he read under F R
Leavis before changing again to law. Unusual for the Cambridge of the time,
he chose to go into industry and joined Metal Box. While training as an
accountant, he came across a 'tall, blond Oxford graduate called Heseltine'
who already ran his own business and seems to have terrified him.
Politics came gradually, partly by building a constituency organisation with
Tebbit. He won Enfield West in a 1970 by-election and quickly became PPS to
Heseltine.
The party chairmanship was the peak of his career. It was on the day of the
election in 1983 that he told Mrs Thatcher about his affair with Sara Keays.
He felt unable to accept the prime minister's offer of the Foreign Office as
a reward for his services and went instead to the Department of Trade and
Industry. There was one achievement: he brought about the settlement between
the Stock Exchange and the Office of Fair Trading which led to Big Bang. But
the affair and the media pursued him and he had to resign. Mrs Thatcher
showed her continuing loyalty by bringing him back later, though only to
energy and transport.
The references to Ms Keays in this book are brief. He repeats that slightly
offensive line in his public statement at the time: 'I am of course making
provision for the mother and child', and there is a singularly ungracious
reference to 'my pregnant former mistress'.
Still, many people found him attractive. The Queen approached him one day:
'They tell me you have influence with the prime minister. She must take a
proper holiday and if you will speak to her about it, so will I'

FT  01 OCT 92 / The clear-up after the party: Collor's heirs inherit a
strengthened democracy but a fragile economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People poured onto the streets across Brazil on Tuesday night to celebrate
the congressional vote which looks set to finish the political career of
President Fernando Collor de Mello and end four months of economic and
political paralysis in Latin America's largest country.
Their joy may be short-lived. When they wake up after their impeachment
parties, Brazilians may well reflect that they have taken a leap into the
unknown. They have ditched the devil they know - an apparently corrupt
politician from the north-east - for one of which they know almost nothing.
Mr Itamar Franco, the 62-year-old vice-president, takes over, but only for a
maximum 180 days while the senate puts the suspended Mr Collor on trial. But
nobody is betting that Mr Collor would win the senate impeachment vote. In
all likelihood, Mr Franco will be president until the end of 1994 when the
next president will take office.
Mr Franco, a former senator, has not made a huge mark in his political
career to date; he stayed discreetly in the background throughout the
impeachment battle. In the 1980s, he made nationalistic speeches suggesting
hostility to the modernisation of the economy, but at that time most
Brazilian legislators were doing the same. More respected for his apparent
moral qualities than for his political vision, Mr Franco looks staid when
set against the jet-skiing Mr Collor.
He does have some things going for him, however. He is likely to enjoy a
honeymoon period: many of the 441 deputies who voted for Mr Collor's
impeachment are likely to support him in Congress, at least initially. Mr
Pedro Simon, a senator and one of Mr Franco's main advisers, said yesterday:
'Never in the history of Brazil has there been such an opportunity for
national understanding.'
There will also be support among the millions who took to the streets to
urge the ousting of Mr Collor. Mr Albueno Averedo, governor of Espirito
Santo, says: 'People took to the streets not just to change the president
but to change the country.'
In fact, Mr Franco takes over a country which has already changed by
demonstrating a new-found political maturity. In the run-up to this week's
vote, constitutional propriety was strictly observed; the ever-watchful
military, which ran the country until 1985, did not intervene; nobody was
killed in the thousands of street protests all over the country and the
press strengthened its reputation as the freest, and most responsible, in
the region.
However, removing the president does not remove Brazil's pressing social and
economic problems.
First, Mr Franco takes over a government in desperate financial straits.
Next year's budget will require swingeing cuts to compensate for a 25 per
cent real fall in tax collection since Mr Collor took office and to pay a
court-ordered 147 per cent increase in pensions, delayed by the Collor
government.
Government spending has already been cut to the bone. The federal government
payroll has fallen from 62 per cent of the overall budget in 1988 to 25 per
cent for the past two years, largely through keeping public sector pay at
low levels. There has been little investment in roads and infrastructure,
and the health and education sectors are in crisis through lack of funding.
To make things worse the last weeks of the Collor government were marked by
big hand-outs to politicians for pet projects in a crude and expensive
attempt to win their support.
Interest rates - which have been kept at more than 30 per cent a month to
keep a control on inflation - are pushing up the government's domestic debt,
and causing interest payments to mushroom. Mr Mailson da Nobrega, a former
economy minister, warns: 'The situation is dramatic. If an emergency tax
reform is not passed immediately next year's budget will be unmanageable.'
On the revenue side, the government has been unable to crack down on tax
evaders, partly because Mr Collor's moral authority was so eroded. An inland
revenue study in July found 76 per cent of big companies were not paying any
tax at all, while the informal 'black' economy is estimated to be at least
half as big as the formal economy.
With the political support he is likely to command initially, Mr Franco
could push through some form of fiscal reform, critical to imparting order
to government finances.
If he succeeds in this, Mr Arminio Fraga, international director of the
Central Bank, believes there are reasons to be bullish about economic
prospects. 'We are handing over a good ball. We have no price controls, no
foreign exchange problem, a competitive exchange rate and have brought
privatisation under way. It would be shame to see all this groundwork
wasted.'
This is undeniably true in Brazil's international financial relations. Mr
Marcilio Marques Moreira, the internationally respected economy minister,
has transformed his country's former image as the black sheep of the
international financial community since he took office in May last year. He
has signed accords with commercial banks and the Paris Club of official
creditors and secured an accord with the International Monetary Fund, though
Brazil has subsequently failed to meet the targets and will have to
renegotiate this. He built up reserves from critical levels of Dollars 7bn
to today's record of Dollars 22bn.
However, domestically, Mr Franco is facing a macroeconomic picture which in
some respects is in no better shape than that which Mr Collor inherited in
1990. Inflation has been stuck at more than 20 per cent a month for more
than a year and a fast-growing public sector borrowing requirement is
heading for 20 per cent of GDP. Industry is in its third year of recession
and wages are at their lowest real level for 12 years. Most industry is
operating with 30 per cent idle capacity and unemployment in Sao Paulo is at
record levels of 16.2 per cent.
Brazilians joke that Mr Moreira has been 'standing on the right road',
rather than moving along it. A recent report from one World Bank economist
describes the policy as a 'lukewarm gradual strategy'. It also criticises
the minister for a costly strategy of using government debt to offset the
inflationary impact of hefty inflows of foreign capital, attracted in part
by high interest rates.
Where Mr Franco's government will stand or fall will be on inflation. Fears
persist that he will be tempted to try a populist measure such as the kind
of shock plans - including confiscations of financial assets and price-wage
freezes - employed by Mr Collor early in his term, though his aides rule
this out. Economists say such schemes would be bound to collapse quickly
unless the government's fiscal house was put in order.
The Franco administration will also come under great pressure from
industrialists, trade unions and state workers to relax some of Mr Collor's
more radical reforms such as the abolition of quotas on imports and tariffs.
For Mr Collor carried out some of his promises to modernise the economy: he
ended 30 years of price controls and 50 years of protectionism, reducing
tariffs and lifting bans on the import of items such as cars and fax
machines.
He took on powerful cartels in areas such as cement and aluminium, prompting
price wars rare in Brazilian history, and changing public opinion in favour
of privatisation.
Mr Collor's allies in the impeachment battle tried to portray Mr Franco as a
retrograde nationalist who would undo all his good work, and claimed that
the campaign against him was a direct result of his attack on vested
interests. Mr Franco is very sensitive on this point and his advisers are
anxious to spread the word that he has changed since the days when he voted
in favour of nationalistic projects. Mr Mauricio Correia Lima, who is
expected to become justice minister, says: 'He's prisoner of the fact that
he was in Congress in the days when everyone was a nationalist.'
Mr Orestes Quercia, leader of the PMDB, the main party supporting Mr Franco,
insists the modernisation programme has nothing to do with Collor's downfall
and that it will now move ahead more smoothly. 'There were good things in
the programme. The problem was that Collor had no political or
administration skills. He was like an architect with a great design but no
possibility of building it. Now this ability exists and we intend to use
it.'
The first test of Mr Franco's commitment to modernisation will be in the
ministers he appoints. The second will be whether he maintains a further
import tariff reduction due today to bring average tariffs down to 17 per
cent. This could be difficult to alter because the country is locked into
external agreements such as that with Mercosul, the proposed customs union
also comprising Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which promises common
external tariffs by 1995.
Mr Franco's task will become more difficult the longer he is in office. He
cannot expect to keep a wide political coalition together over the long
term, and he lacks the authority of an electoral mandate. Moreover, Mr
Collor plans to hang around and fight out the senate judgment over the next
six months, hoping that he could still make a comeback, as unlikely as that
seems.
The attention of congressmen will soon be distracted once more, with next
April's crucial referendum to decide the country's future political system -
monarchy, presidential or parliamentary. If, as expected, a parliamentary
system is chosen, new laws will be required to strengthen the fragmented
party system which has made the country difficult to govern.
There are already mutterings of a return to the dark days of former
President Jose Sarney. Another vice-president propelled unexpectedly to high
office, Mr Sarney took office in 1985 after President Tancredo Neves died
before he could assume office. Beholden to too many parties and interests,
the Sarney administration was marked by constant squabbling and paralysis
and degenerated into a spending spree which caused inflation to hit 84 per
cent a month.
Mr Franco's administration risks a similar fate. Brazilians expect him to
crack down on corruption and tax evasion to prevent a repeat of the
Collorgate scandal. Mr Aristides Junqueira, the attorney-general, comments:
'I think Tuesday's vote will mark the end of impunity for corrupt
politicians in Brazil, but it will not be easy and we must not let Collor's
ouster be a mere panacea.'
It sounds good. But Brazil has a history of disappointing optimists. The
fact is that Mr Franco will have a lot of hopes to fulfil in his two years
and three months in office and no money in the coffers with which to do it.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Leading Article: The pressures on Mr Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO-GERMAN bickering over the Bundesbank's role in sterling's misfortunes
entered a new phase yesterday with Dr Helmut Schlesinger's fierce rebuttal
of recent British government 'reproaches'. It is clearly futile, as well as
indefensible, for the UK to unload the blame for British economic failures
on to Germany's independent central bank. What is not, however, in question,
is that overall German policy errors since the unification process started
in 1990 have contributed to European-wide economic problems.
The Bundesbank's high interest rates represent not a symbol of German
strength, but the price of German policy weakness, manifested in Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's inability to put the financing of German unification on to a
healthier footing. Slow economic growth around the continent is one factor -
among others - behind the rising discontent over the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Kohl wants to salvage the treaty. He also, presumably, wants to rescue
his country from the potentially dire effects of the rapid build-up of
public sector debt generated by generous state financing of east German
living standards. On the 10th anniversary of his accession to the
chancellorship, Mr Kohl thus has two compelling reasons for putting
Germany's economic house in order.
Mr Kohl needs to succeed during the next 12 months in creating the
conditions for a self-generating upturn in the eastern part of his country.
Otherwise, Germany - as the continent's pivotal economic and political power
 -will bear some responsibility for the possible fragmentation of the
western part of the continent.
German stagnation
The threat is not that the Maastricht process will take place at varying
speeds, with a small number of countries going ahead at first. This
development is the only possible way for economic and monetary union to
proceed, and was always implicit in the timetable agreed last year. The
greatest danger is that if the German economy runs into fully-fledged
recession, European integration as a whole will grind to a halt. Without a
solid German core, even a two-speed Europe is likely to be a pipe dream.
Germany's domestic prospects are far from encouraging. The economy in the
west has been stagnant for months, while the hoped-for recovery in the east
has tailed off. The government has made inadequate efforts to cut subsidies
and spending. This has led to a position - unsustainable in the long term -
under which transfers from the west account for more than half east
Germany's gross domestic product.
The sharp rise of the D-Mark against other European currencies has depressed
chances for export-led growth. Since Germany's unit labour costs are now
rising faster than those of most competitors, German industry is in a far
worse position to withstand the latest currency revaluation than during the
1970s and 1980s.
Inflationary danger
The Bundesbank's net monetary reserves have risen by an unprecedented DM68bn
in the latest two weeks as a result of action to prop up sterling, the lira
and the French franc. The extra liquidity on German money markets,
notwithstanding the Bundesbank's comprehensive 'mopping up' operations, is
likely to fuel the inflationary pressures which the Bundesbank most fears.
This, in turn, will prevent a rapid fall in D-Mark interest rates.
Just when robust expansion is needed, Germany could be in store for an
ill-timed bout of stagflation. Yet there is a chance for Mr Kohl to break
free from the encircling dangers. When Germany set off down the road to
unity two years ago, the world knew it would represent the most severe test
of the country's resolve and cohesion. Germany has failed to generate the
spirit of national consensus needed to meet that test - but it is not too
late.
In a bid to repair his mistake of two years ago, the chancellor has launched
an attempt to spread the burdens of unity financing as widely as possible,
under a mooted 'solidarity pact' with trade unions and employers. This is
the right first step. Germany's economic policies of the moment are bad for
itself and worse for its neighbours. The reaffirmation of Germany' European
commitment should start at home.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Mr Major must choose
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TO GOVERN is to choose. After the simultaneous collapse of both his foreign
and his economic policies, Mr Major could have chosen to resign. He has not.
Now he needs to make other choices: first, he should ask for Mr Norman
Lamont's resignation; second, he should demand a new economic policy from Mr
Lamont's successor; and third, he should pass the Maastricht treaty through
the House of Commons.
Mr Lamont must go. This is not because he is personally responsible for the
disaster that befell the government's ERM policy. The responsibility is far
more widely shared, not least by Mr Major. It is also not because everything
he said about never devaluing the pound was brutally belied by events.
Finance ministers in his situation must speak confidently, while hoping that
their words are not swiftly disproved.
The case for resignation is, first, that Mr Lamont was on the watch at the
time the ERM policy hit the reef. The case for resignation is, second, that
he has discredited himself by what he has said since sterling's departure
from the ERM. The case for resignation is, third, that Mr Lamont cannot
credibly articulate the new policy that the UK now needs.
Mr Lamont has said that 'we will have a British monetary policy tailored to
the needs of the British economy'. How can a chancellor who has confessed
that his past policy was not in the country's interests stay in the job? He
has also damaged the long term interests of the country by the all too
public debate between himself and Dr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's
president.
Mr Lamont is simply not the man to articulate a new economic policy with
conviction. What he is saying - with his list of monetary indicators and his
promises to tighten control over public spending - is 'trust me'. But why
should the country trust him?
No early re-entry
New measures need a new man. The new chancellor will discover that he does
have one advantage. Judged by the Labour party conference, the opposition
offers not a new policy, but support for the old one, combined with constant
complaints about its inescapable consequences for interest rates and
manufacturing industry. It should be possible for a new chancellor to be
more coherent than that.
What should be the basis of a new policy? First, an early return to the ERM
is undesirable. This is partly because the other members are loath to have
sterling back in. More importantly, the interest rate consequences of
rejoining the ERM are quite unknown, but past experience suggests they are
likely to be destabilising. Until the turmoil of German unification has
begun to work itself out, the government should stick to a promise to seek
re-entry 'when the time is ripe'. To show the government is not turning away
from its European engagement, ratification of the Maastricht treaty should
be pursued with vigour.
New policy framework
Nevertheless, the government should postpone attempts to return to the ERM
only if it establishes a policy framework, with institutions to match, that
give it some hope of doing better for itself. There is an opportunity for
combining recovery with low inflation. It is only if that opportunity is
exploited that the UK will be able to contribute successfully to the
development of the European Community.
The difficult policy questions now are how far and how fast should interest
rates be lowered and how far and how fast should fiscal policy be tightened.
Neither can be answered with conviction. The economy is in uncharted waters.
The authorities must feel their way, which is precisely why institutional
arrangements for policy analysis and formulation must be improved. But the
principles that should underpin those answers are clear.
These are, first, that the UK needs another consumer-led boom like a hole in
the head. It needs a slow and steady recovery, led by exports. Monetary and
fiscal policies must serve that end. Secondly, a devaluation cannot bring
enduring benefits if it does not lead to a sustained lowering of wages in
relation to the prices of tradable goods and services.
The end of the ERM policy was a humiliating disaster. But it has a silver
lining. The government can choose once more. What it must demonstrate is
that it has the maturity to choose wisely.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (9): When push comes to
shove - Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK MEREDITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S five new towns are not going to go quietly. Their key role in
economic development distinguishes them from their English counterparts and
has made phasing them out a difficult task for the Scottish Office.
East Kilbride, Cumbernauld, Livingston, Glenrothes and Irvine have been
instrumental in the industrial transformation of Scotland. They have been
the magnet for inward investment providing professional, centralised and
comprehensive handling for relocations particularly in the high technology
industries which have replaced some of the heavy industries which have died
away.
The government has wanted to absorb the five new towns in its restructuring
of industrial promotion in Scotland. But the industrial culture, as well as
the physical property, of the five is proving hard to swallow and the
government's initial enthusiasm for the idea seems to have waned.
What is more, the new town Development Corporations themselves have made it
quite clear that theirs is a difficult act to follow especially if the
towns' role in promotion is to be taken up by the private sector as planned.
'It is a strange concept that we are to disappear without trace and no-one
is to notice that we have gone,' says Mr Martin Cracknell, chief executive
of Glenrothes in Fife. 'It is difficult to see how others could do our work.
We do things here that are not commercial and which would not get done if
commercial forces were left to handle it.'
Among the new Development Corporations is a feeling that the expertise they
have collected may be wasted and that the government is re-inventing the
wheel in hoping that this know-how can easily be picked up by the network of
new Local Enterprise Companies.
The LECs are private organisations with public sector funding and are part
of Scottish Enterprise, the de-centralised successor to the Scottish
Development Agency.
The readiness of the LECs to take the residual assets of the Development
Corporations seems mixed and many are fully stretched already coming to
grips with their remit to encourage local enterprise.
In its white paper The Scottish New Towns: The Way Forward published in
1989, the Scottish Office floated the idea of management buy-outs for the
teams running the new towns.
'A development company set up through the management buy-out option would
allow invaluable experience of the staff to be retained and more widely
applied in the private sector,' it said.
This idea appears to have become partially unstuck over the disposal of the
considerable assets of the new towns. In May, the Herald newspaper in
Glasgow got hold of new Scottish Office guidelines issued to the new towns
which ordered them to 'maximise disposal receipts' for land and property.
This would make it nearly impossible for a management buy-out to be
sympathetically considered by government because a new town management might
not be able to produce the best price for its land and buildings.
Possible conflicts of interest might also arise as the new towns would be
selling their own property. There is a feeling among new town executives
that the government is demonstrating how much intense scrutiny it faces over
the disposal of public assets and that the Scottish Office has gone off any
sell off that would not get the best price.
The new Scottish Office guidelines, issued just before the General Election,
say that the appropriate asset base for any one taking on where the new
towns left off would be a portfolio made up largely of development land and
part-developed estates.
This effectively leaves the present new town management with the option of
selling themselves as largely service companies or consultants to the Local
Enterprise Companies. Corporation staffs will be cut from several hundred to
possibly under 20.
The Herald disclosure has already provoked anger in the opposition Labour
Party. Mr Alex Smith, a Scottish Euro MP, has demanded that before any new
town assets could go to the Treasury the European Commission would have to
be repaid for any development it backed in the new towns.
The matter has more time to stew for some of the new towns than others. Last
February the Scottish Office issued the winding-up date for the five new
towns. East Kilbride and Glenrothes are to go on December 31, 1995;
Cumbernauld on December 31 1996, Livingston on December 31 1998 and Irvine
on December 1999.
'We are lucky that everyone has until 1998 to consider the implications,'
says Mr James Pollock, chief executive of Livingston Development
Corporation. Livingston has more undeveloped land than the older new towns
and could fit in with the revised government thinking.
'The new towns have been successful in their ability to work in a local
area. We have a total team package able to focus on specific areas needing
regeneration,' Mr Pollock adds.
Livingston has been successful in attracting inward investment in Scotland.
It now has more than 400 resident companies and 42 per cent of these are in
manufacturing.
Mr John Shaw, the managing director of East Kilbride, warned that Pounds
100m of public and private investment will be withdrawn from his Lanarkshire
area in the wind-up.
'I would very much like to see new systems credibly in operation before the
new towns are dissolved. It would be a tragedy if this experience is lost to
Scotland,' he says.
East Kilbride started in 1947 with a population of 2,000 and now has 670,000
inhabitants. It was first set up to relieve congestion in nearby Glasgow and
created 32,000 jobs.
East Kilbride has returned an operating profit for the past 23 years and
created assets worth Pounds 220m.
Mr Shaw's administration approaches wind-up without any debt to hand on to
his successors.
'The more difficult and worrying task for the future is to ensure that the
domestic and international business built up in the new towns is sustained
and developed,' he says.
'Scottish new towns have been the most consistently successful urban
development initiative of the post-war era in any country in Europe. All of
them are committed to Scotland and to support local economy where we live
and work. We hope very much that we have the opportunity to contribute to
those areas following the wind-up.'

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (8): The rural fabric of
domesticity - Most new towns are notable for their unmemorable architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH new towns conjure up the whole range of architectural visions of the
second half of the twentieth century.
In fact, their architectural origins go right back to the early days of new
town propaganda when Ebenezer Howard published his manifesto about garden
cities in 1898, Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform.
This book was full of utopian ideas about town planning based upon Howard's
own version of what he called, 'Common sense socialism'. Ebeneezer Howard
was to go on to found in the early 1900s his First Garden City Company and
to assemble the land and devise a plan for the building of Letchworth Garden
City in Hertfordshire.
To plan the very first British new town Howard employed the services of
Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, two very young architects who were
responsible for the physical form of Howard's socially reforming ideas.
Gardens and landscape were almost as important as the architecture - indeed
the main architectural virtues of Letchworth are to be seen in the modest
and sensibly planned traditional houses.
Architects involved in the early days of the garden city movement were
responsible for building the visions of practical idealists. At Letchworth
and later at Welwyn Garden City the architecture definitely takes second
place to the planning of interrelated housing and industrial areas.
Domestic architecture is agreeable and modest in these towns and the public
buildings are mainly traditional and unadventurous. The mission of the early
new towns was not to create architectural monuments but to provide good
simple homes with gardens and easy access to the workplace.
In Britain, the first new towns were far from the forefront of 20th Century
architecture. There is little sign of the influence of the International
Modern Movement or of pioneers such as Le Corbusier in the British new towns
until well after the second world war.
Harlow new town in Essex was one of the first towns to acquire a distinctive
architectural character. The architect for the town was Sir Frederic
Gibberd, probably better known as the architect of Heathrow Airport and the
wig-wam shaped Roman Catholic cathedral of Christ the King in Liverpool.
He had very strong architectural ideas and introduced the first tower block
of flats into a new town. Harlow was designated in 1947 and its town centre
has some of the modern sentimentality of the early 1950s. The sentiment
comes in modern interpretations of traditional market square and clock
tower.
The atmosphere of the new towns of the 1950s was that of the Festival of
Britain - a sort of spiky contemporary architecture and a child-like use of
primary colours. Harlow, however, did pioneer the commissioning of works of
art and is now famous for its outdoor sculpture collection.
Stevenage, Crawley, Bracknell, Basildon, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead and
Welwyn, Newton Aycliffe and Peterlee all belong to the English first
generation of new towns being designated in the 1940s. They are all
architecturally unmemorable.
Of this first wave only Peterlee had a distinctive architectural agenda. The
emigre Russian modernist architect Berthold Lubetkin, famous for the penguin
pool at London Zoo, was brought in to design the town. His proposals were
imaginative and very promising essays in abstract modern architecture. But
Lubetkin fell foul of the elaborate committee system that tends to dog any
major public enterprise in Britain and felt obliged to resign. He was not
prepared to compromise on his distinctive architectural designs and so
Peterlee lost the chance to be an uncompromisingly modern new town.
Of the second wave of new towns (late 1950s and early 1960s) it was
Cumbernauld in Scotland - commissioned in 1955 - that took the opportunity
to have a remarkable town centre design that separated the motor car from
the pedestrian and effectively made the whole town centre one large
megastructure.
The architects were a firm called Wilson and Womersley. Their design was
based on the wish to make the town easy for the pedestrian. The vast town
centre on a hilltop has never won many architectural plaudits. The use of
concrete as the main material was an unwise choice for the Scottish climate
and the centre has weathered badly.
It has been left to Milton Keynes, Britain's largest new town founded in
North Buckinghamshire in the 1960s, to be the one town that had produced
architecture and landscaping that could be considered remarkable.
The appointment of Fred Lloyd Roche and Derek Walker to head up the
development team of architects created an unusual architectural climate in
the new city. The Development Corporation built up a very strong team of
architects so that a great deal of the new architecture was designed
'in-house'.
The main manifestation of this policy is the great shopping centre that is
one giant mall. It is designed in a simple and elegant way - unremarkable
outside but beautifully planted and finished internally. Two things
particularly distinguish Milton Keynes - its grid plan of roads - designed
by the master planners Llewelyn-Davies, Weekes, Forestier Walker and Bor,
and the quality of its industrial buildings that were all supervised by the
Development Corporation architects.
On the housing front the town is also interesting being built at a time when
private housing played its part in the growth of the city. A wide range of
architects and developers built housing in the city including Sir Norman
Foster and Ralph Erskine. There are no monuments in any of the new towns -
Milton Keynes is remarkable for a Buddhist Temple and a domed ecumenical
church in the very centre of the town.
Architects played their part in the development of the new towns but it has
to be said that the British wish to live in green places that may well
appear suburban is what has won the day in the new towns. Their mixture of
uses makes them urban but in appearance and spaciousness they are not so
much towns as new suburbs.
The British like the idea of the country in the town and MIlton Keynes has
achieved this to an unusual degree. Although Milton Keynes has very good
architecture - it has millions of very good trees. These make the town
almost invisible from the roads - and perhaps it is true of almost all the
towns that the landscaping puts the architecture in its place.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (10): Strong local
control - Why French new towns are different
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE has still not resolved the problem of social unrest in impoverished
suburbs, but it is breathing more easily over its 20-year-old experience of
new towns.
There are now seven new towns in France, of which five ring the densely
packed capital of Paris. The two others are outside Lyons in southern France
and Marseilles on the Mediterranean. The one outside Lille in the north
became part of the city in 1982, and one near Rouen was scrapped at the end
of 1988 after running into development problems.
The statistic the authorities are most proud of is that the number of jobs
matches the size of the workforce living in most new towns. This is against
a backdrop of an unemployment rate of about 10 per cent. Seven years ago,
no-one was counting on achieving this goal.
Although initially France modelled its new towns on those in the UK, several
differences have emerged in subsequent years. Here, new town planning and
management have become much less concentrated in the hands of central
government since the decentralisation of power began 10 years ago.
For the first 10 years, social housing represented about 90 per cent of the
total. But now, about two-thirds of the housing is developed by the private
sector, whereas the public sector still dominates in the UK. It is estimated
that every French franc of state cash generates up to FFr10 of private money
poured into property, industry and other economic activities.
Another important difference between the two countries was that the French
new towns were carved out of agricultural land at least 25 kilometres from
the nearest town, whereas in the UK they were built alongside industrial
conurbations. For the French this meant that the basic infrastructure also
had to be provided.
Social diversity has come to new towns in France with the arrival of large
corporate enterprises. The foreign companies are mostly American, Japanese
and German, and include IBM, Hewlett Packard, 3M and Honda.
Despite doubts at the start, senior executives have opted to live in the new
towns, where all the facilities required for them and their families are
close at hand.
Universities too are being built to cater to the second generation of
residents in and around new towns. One of the difficulties facing the
student population is the lack of suitable housing. In the absence of rooms
to let, the authorities are looking for a new concept.
Four universities will be operating this academic year, and will welcome a
total of nearly 4,000 students. The 1995 target is 10,000 in each
establishment, which concentrate on science and technology, economics and
law, and will offer all levels of degree.
Thought is also being given to retirement homes to fill in another remaining
social gap. Contrary to expectations, people are putting down roots, and are
creating true communities.
Today the new towns in France house about 800,000 people and provide jobs to
300,000. The five around Paris are at different stages of development. Evry
and St. Quentin-en-Yvelines are almost finished, whereas Marne-la-Vallee,
which is also home to the EuroDisneyland theme park, is expected to take
another 15 years to complete and Melun-Senart another 20 years.
Recently, one could be forgiven for believing that nothing happened in
Marne-la-Vallee until EuroDisney arrived. But already FFr5bn a year has been
invested there in the past decade. With the theme park, the new town is the
second largest building site in France after the Channel Tunnel.
Until the end of 1991, investments in French new towns held up better than
in other areas of the Paris region, according to M. Gilles Carrez,
secretary-general of the governmental Groupe Central des Villes Nouvelles.
Since then, the pinch has been felt in office and upper range residential
property. But the equivalent of council housing and lower priced private
homes remain relatively healthy.
The fear now is that the continuing drop in land and property prices will
narrow the difference between those prevailing in new towns and other parts
of the capital area.
Meanwhile, lessons have been learned from the mistakes of the 1970s, when
split-level urban planning was in fashion. Now there is a return to more
traditional ideas of town centres. Those to be developed in St.
Quentin-en-Yvelines and Melun-Senart will even include hypermarkets in order
to integrate them into the overall scheme of shopping. This will increase
development costs sharply, but the human gains are expected to outweigh the
financial outlays.

CAR MAKERS Nissan, semiconductor manufacturers Fujitsu and bearings
producers NSK have more than Japanese ownership in common.
All three have big European manufacturing plants between the Tyne and the
Tees, in the three former new towns of Washington, Aycliffe and Peterlee.
The plants' proximity is not a coincidence; the positive experience of NSK,
north east England's first Japanese company when it set up in Peterlee in
1976, was influential in Nissan's choice in 1984 of Washington for its
European car plant, at Pounds 900m Europe's biggest single Japanese
investment.
In 1989, the growing number of Japanese companies operating successfully in
north east England was a factor in Fujitsu's choice of Aycliffe for its
Pounds 400m microchip plant. So too - as well as the clean water needed in
microchip manufacture - were good road communications, a greenfield site and
the availability of suitable labour.
It is sobering, however, to reflect that after the decades of effort and
money put into creating these three new towns, even after their proven
success in attracting inward investment from many countries and fostering
home grown companies, their areas suffer unemployment well above the
national average.
Without the towns, the painful consequences of the rundown of traditional
heavy industries would have been much more acute.
But although the three fought successfully to postpone their winding up
until 1988, Peterlee especially could argue that the end of new town status
came much too soon.
Created in 1948 to offer better housing for miners' families and jobs for
their wives, Peterlee's job creation remit broadened as the Durham coalfield
declined. By 1988 its industrial estates provided more than 7,000 jobs. Yet,
says East Durham Development Agency chief executive Mr Eddie Morley, the
town cannot keep up with the new tide of pit closures.
In the last 18 months two collieries have closed in East Durham, where
Peterlee is located, costing 2,000 jobs, and the district's last two,
together employing 2,400, are under threat.
Moreover, Peterlee faces stiff competition for investment from the new
Enterprise Zone in nearby Sunderland and two government-funded Development
Corporations, in Tyne and Wear and Teesside. And Easington district council
is still having difficulty maintaining the new town's flat-roofed housing.
Aycliffe, near Darlington, and Peterlee each has a population of about
25,000. At winding up, Aycliffe, designated in 1947, had just under 10,000
jobs. Today it has 9,700, having suffered several substantial closures
including GEC's telephone handset plant, since refurbished and relet to a
number of smaller companies.
On the plus side, Aycliffe has Fujitsu, employing 425 in a plant in which
Pounds 240m will have been invested by the end of 1992. The company hopes
eventually to employ 1,200.
Unified in 1963 under a single development corporation, Peterlee and
Aycliffe's residual assets are now owned by Helical Bar. About 150 acres of
industrial land remains on Peterlee's estates and 40 acres at Aycliffe's.
Asking price is Pounds 60,000 per acre.
Washington, designated in 1947, now forms part of the borough of Sunderland
within Tyne and Wear. The capture of Nissan was a team effort by North East
councils, economic development bodies and trades unions. The project has had
tremendous impact on the entire region, by creating jobs, boosting morale
and influencing attitudes to quality and working practices.
The Nissan plant, due to employ 4,600 at Sunderland by the year end, is now
one of north east England's largest workplaces, exporting 80 per cent of its
cars to 30 countries including Japan. Another 1,400 people work on the
Pounds 900m site in related ventures.
Other Washington employers include outdoor clothing manufacturers Berghaus
and hologram specialists Applied Holographics. The town's residual assets
are managed by the Commission for the New Towns.
Substantially bigger than Peterlee and Aycliffe - its population is now
61,500 - Washington has a larger shopping complex, the Galleries.
Strategically located near the A1(M) and A19, Washington is also currently a
focus for new hotel development. Campanile UK is building an 80 bedroom
hotel. And imposing Usworth Hall, once the National Coal Board's regional
base and then Washington Development Corporation's HQ, was in July sold for
Pounds 3.5m to Persimmon Homes (NE) and DJA Properties. The purchasers plan
to turn the hall into a luxury hotel and build houses in its grounds.

The Midlands

TELFORD and Milton Keynes provide the most strenuous challenges for the
Commission of New Towns in its efforts to dispose of public assets in the
new towns of the Midlands. The two are the latest and last of the CNT's
responsibilities in the region.
CNT took over the activities of the respective development corporations at
Telford last October and at Milton Keynes last April. The timing was
difficult. The pace of asset disposals has slackened with the recession and
although activity continues it is slower than two years ago.
'The slowdown in the last year of the development corporation has carried
through into the CNT's first six months,' said Mr John Napleton, the CNT
executive officer in Milton Keynes. 'The world economy is not helping us.
Having said that, we've been some years with the present recession and 9.5
per cent unemployment is beneath the regional average,' said Mr Chris
Mackrell, CNT's officer in Telford.
The two towns have much in common, despite their geographical differences
and despite the fact that Milton Keynes is a brand new town while Telford
new town is welded to old Telford. Indeed, they compete in the same market
for relocating companies.
Both seek to attract companies which are looking for greenfield development
sites, outside the major conurbations. As such they play on a continental
rather than a local scale.
'One of the characteristics is the number of companies which have said 'it's
between you and Spain, you and Luxembourg; I can't recall anyone saying its
between you and Birmingham, you and Wednesbury',' observed Mr Mackrell.
Just as Milton Keynes is particularly keen to attract what Mr Napleton
called 'light clean industry with a high number of employees,' or more of
what has arrived already, so Telford is in the same position. In fact, the
arrival of companies in the plastics and electronics sectors has widened the
economic base of the town.
Telford's position on the western side of the West Midlands means inevitably
that its land prices at around Pounds 130,000 an acre are less than those of
Milton Keynes, which is more susceptible to London influences. Here the rate
is more like Pounds 250,000 an acre, but that itself is some Pounds 50,000
less than it was two years ago and is lower again than the current price
level in Northampton, where the CNT also has asset disposal
responsibilities.
It is the size of the CNT land banks in Milton Keynes and Telford - about
2,000 acres in each - that sets them off from other CNT operations in the
Midlands.
This is not to suggest that Milton Keynes and Telford have no buildings for
sale. They do, and in that respect they are in the same position as Corby,
Northampton and Redditch.
But the work of the CNT in Corby, Northampton and Redditch is not now so
significant in scale as it is in Milton Keynes and Telford. In Redditch, for
example, the CNT has a Pounds 50m portfolio of assets, but it has already
realised more than Pounds 70m from sales. In Corby there are isolated
premises for sale and some 90 acres of sites for industrial development.
Likewise in Northampton there are isolated premises, but the focal point of
the CNT portfolio in the town remains about 600 acres of land, a significant
amount but small in comparison with the quantity available in Milton Keynes
and Telford.
The focus of the CNT activity is now almost wholly commercial property.
Ballots among the tenants of rented housing established by the Milton Keynes
Development Corporation expressed a preference for the transfer of property
control to the Milton Keynes Borough Council. This allowed CNT to disengage
from the public housing sector.
But it remains a responsibility of the CNT to promote the towns, where it
has interests, as developing commercial centres. In both Milton Keynes and
Telford it has sought to involve local organisations in the practical work
of marketing. To that extent it plays a more subdued role than the former
development corporations.
In the case of Telford, it has combined with bodies such as Wrekin District
Council and Shropshire County Council to form the Telford Development
Agency. In the case of Milton Keynes, it has adopted a similar partnership
with local authorities.
These respective bodies will have a difficult time until the international
economy shows stronger signs of sustained growth. But they work against the
background of a stable local infrastructure.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (5): Inside the triangle
 -The North-West
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the motorway network which explains the rationale, location and the
success of north-west England's four new towns.
The network is probably the most comprehensive in Britain and puts
Manchester, Liverpool and Preston within about 45 minutes of each other. The
new towns - Warrington, Runcorn, Skelmersdale and Central Lancashire - have
filled in the triangle which these main regional centres form.
The triangle has Preston at its apex and Liverpool and Manchester at the
other two corners. It is bisected by the M6 and has the M62 transpennine
motorway running along a double baseline with the M56, which runs parallel
to it south of the Mersey.
The network as a whole has been gradually developed over the last 25 years
and most of its links are now complete. The new towns have been built on
existing communities at strategic nodes of the motorway network.
For example, Warrington is at the crossover point of the M6 and M62, while
Runcorn is on the M56 near where the Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal are
crossed by road and rail bridges.
All are in the M6 corridor, Skelmersdale at the motorway's junction with the
M58 link to the Port of Liverpool and Central Lancashire - comprising mainly
Leyland and Chorley - actually straddling the motorway, with its eastern
sections fitting neatly between the M6 and the M61.
The result is that people living in Warrington, Skelmersdale, Leyland,
Chorley or Runcorn can commute easily almost anywhere in the region;
rush-hour queues on all the motorways suggest that many do. Finding work
locally is, therefore, not necessarily crucial, although all the new towns
have fared reasonably well in being able to provide it.
Location has been the crucial benefit to offer inward investors. Financial
assistance has also helped - and still does in Runcorn, which is in the
Merseyside catchment area for special selective assistance. This has helped
attract several US and German companies.
However, the investment record of companies around Warrington in particular
emphasises the value of quick access to markets by road, rail or through
Manchester Airport, only 20 minutes away.
A circle of 200 miles radius drawn on Warrington takes in 97 per cent of
Britain's population; the distribution industry was quick to take advantage
of the benefit, as Warrington's vast complexes of warehouses prove.
Total population growth in the four towns has been dramatic: they had a
little over 395,000 people between them when the programme started but the
latest figures show them now approaching 560,000, a rise of more than 40 per
cent.
Many are young married couples raising new families. Not everything has been
wonderful: the late Sir James Stirling, the celebrated architect, had a
notorious failure at Runcorn, where a large public sector housing estate
designed for Liverpool's overspill became known as 'Legoland'. Crime-ridden,
and with social and constructional defects, it had to be abandoned.
Skelmersdale also had problems, including vandalism, now largely solved by
redesigning the configuration of housing estates to encourage
neighbourliness.
Whether the new towns genuinely create new jobs in a region or just relocate
them from old conurbations such as Merseyside and Greater Manchester has
always been a moot point among politicians. However, the list of companies
based there is impressive and many would almost certainly have never
expanded in, say, Liverpool, had the new towns not been there.
Warrington and Runcorn - which combined their previously separate new town
administrations in 1981 - claim 63,000 new jobs, many at such giants as
Digital Equipment, Goodyear, Coca-Cola, Nacanco, Guinness, Nestle, YKK
Fasteners, British Nuclear Fuels, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, Securicor,
Schreiber, British Gypsum, Rowntree Mackintosh and Safeway.
This is a comprehensive spread for two towns known chiefly for chemicals,
brewing and making wires. Moreover, the big companies support a network of
suppliers or - in the case of the nuclear industry - high tech service,
design or consultancy businesses staffed by highly paid professionals who
make a disproportionate contribution to the local tax base and spending
power.
Skelmersdale, once a small community of 10,000 people between Ormskirk and
Wigan, is now more than four times bigger and has created 12,000 jobs in
sectors such as automotive, electrical and chemical engineering,
electronics, textiles, plastics, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food
processing, banking and distribution.
Leyland and Chorley already had an automotive industry - a troubled one -
but the Commission for the New Towns says there are 18,000 new jobs there,
in spite of the restructuring that has hit the buses and truck industries.
Foreign investment has come from the US, Germany, Japan, France and
Portugal.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (4): Utopias of yesterday
 -The London Ring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY year, a class of 13-year-olds is thrown into confusion by the task set
by a teacher in a smallish town north of London. 'Find out when and why we
were once the centre of world attention,' she says.
A few will always scramble through sports encyclopedias. Did the local
football team once beat the European champions? Others comb the newspaper
libraries to suggest some forgotten accident or royal visit. The shrewd ones
ask their parents.
Almost 50 years ago Stevenage was designated as Utopia. Enlightened land
owners had been creating 'new' towns for centuries. In fact, two garden
cities were already established at Welwyn and Letchworth a few miles each
side of the site off the the A1 chosen for Stevenage. But this was the first
government-inspired bid to create a new way of life.
Sam (later Lord) Silkin, the 'father' of post-war town planning, faced a
similar audience to that teacher, but raised laughter rather than bemusement
when he announced in the Commons: 'Stevenage will in a short time become
world famous. People from all over the world will come to see how we are
building a new way of life.'
But he was right. It dominated attention, if only because of
anti-development passions as strong as anything seen today over plans to
build on the green belt. Then Crawley, a little Sussex town of 5,000 people,
designated next on the list took over the limelight, inspiring one angry
protester to insist that 50,000 new people would spoil his enjoyment of sea
breezes. The site is 25 miles from the coast.
To a 13-year-old there is little 'new' in the ring of towns created in the
late-1940s to rehouse bomb-battered and slum-debilitated Londoners. In fact
it is only older residents and outsiders who still use the title.
Development corporations have disappeared, leaving only the Commission for
New Towns (CNT) to sell off remaining assets.
District councils have taken over the reins again, and new towns have merged
with local economies. But most still perform the same function as when they
were born, offering people and businesses an escape from the congested
metropolis. Some, such as Bracknell, have attracted companies from even
further afield. It is now a fully-fledged international office centre,
boasting companies like ICI and BMW. More than 30 acres have just been
acquired by 3M for a new headquarters.
The very fact that these communities are now merged into their surroundings,
however, means that not everything is rosy. Like the rest of the south-east
they are weighed down with empty buildings and unemployment. But the burden
is generally lighter than many older neighbours'.
'They all have modern infrastructure and good locations, which has attracted
offices. But the workforce drawn out of London also drew a lot of industrial
businesses,' says Stephen Mallen of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley Research. That has
produced not only a wide economic base, but one more resistant to the
service-sector recession which has hammered major office centres.
Basildon, where the original small town has been quadrupled to more than
100,000, looks to Tilbury Docks and Ford Motors. Northern Telecom had enough
confidence to pay CNT almost Pounds 4m for its freehold in the Pipps Hill
Industrial Area this year, while Colour Court Properties spent slightly less
on the former Carreras Rothman playing fields at Nevendon, and Wilcon Homes
laid out more than Pounds 3m for land at Dunton Hills. The commission is
down to its last major town centre site, although it has large amounts of
land to develop.
Crawley grew from bare fields to almost 56,000 people, many of whom draw a
living from nearby Gatwick Airport and its massive warehousing developments.
A pension fund has recently invested more than Pounds 9m buying half the
Martlets shopping centre.
Harlow, another greenfield development now boasting a population of more
than 72,000, also has an airport, Stansted, on the doorstep. But it has seen
a significant office expansion as well by General Portfolio over the last
year. 'This is significant because it shows that new towns can hang on to
firms which may have been attracted by grants or other incentives,' says Mr
Mallen.
Hatfield is one of the smaller centres, with only around 25,000 inhabitants.
Until last week, its long-standing ties with British Aerospace had provided
a solid base. This has now been shattered by BAe's decision to close its
plant there with the loss of 2,000 jobs. There are also long faces over the
huge Galleria shopping centre, which seems to have failed because it aimed
too far up market for the local people.
Hemel Hempstead (pop. 77,000) - technically an expanded rather than a new
town - and Stevenage (pop 76,000) both have strong industrial bases
liberally scattered with electronics and other new technology which have
helped ease the pain of recession. Sovereign Land bought shops and flats in
central Hemel for Pounds 7m and Burford Group paid CNT more than Pounds 2m.
Welwyn (pop 40,000), the last of the London ring, could claim to qualify as
the first, as it was a new town long before the others were even thought
about. It was set up by the movement's pioneer, Ebenezer Howard, in the
1920s, and therefore has a solid industrial base as well as pleasant
surroundings.
At the other extreme, almost touching the Midlands, stands Milton Keynes,
which came along 20 years after the ring was formed and proved the last UK
new town. In fact, it is more a city, with more than 150,000 people. Numbers
are still growing, with an influx of more than 2,500 last year drawn by a
broad economic base which has helped ease the pain of recession by keeping
unemployment almost two points below the national 9.5 per cent.
The private sector has taken this giant baby to its heart, investing almost
Pounds 365m last year. Of the Pounds 3.2bn spent since this 'third
generation' new town was set up in 1967, some Pounds 2.6bn has come from
private investors. The aim is to create another 35,000 jobs and raise the
population above 200,000. Transfer to the NTC this year (discussed in the
Midlands article on the facing page) has also opened a new chapter for the
commission, as it works through the final stages of selling off the
remaining assets.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (2): The going gets tough
 -The agency which sells new town assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMISSION for New Towns is moving into perhaps the most challenging
period of its finite life.
The agency was set up 30 years ago to sell off the assets left behind by
England's new town development corporations. While it fulfilled its
government remit well during the 1980s - helped for most of the period by a
booming property market which devoured land and buildings and boosted values
 -the commission faces a much tougher task in the next 10 years.
Once regarded as an over-bureaucratic, unprofessional and unresponsive
government agency, the commission has taken pride over the last decade in
rebuilding itself into a commercially-oriented 'street-wise' organisation.
By this year, it had sold assets worth nearly Pounds 2bn, peaking in 1990 at
around Pounds 300m. But it still holds assets of an equal value and has to
dispose of them in a climate which is likely to be far less accommodating
than the 1980s. The commission's commercial credentials are about to be put
through their hardest test.
The property markets around which the organisation's activities revolve
remain flat on their back. Yet the commission is still obliged to meet
government-imposed asset realisation targets - now largely involving land
rather than bricks and mortar - on a scale which will test its commercial
expertise to the full.
The targets, after long discussions with the Department of the Environment
held in the shadow of the Treasury, have in the last three years been
revised downwards to take account of the economic climate. But they remain
tough to meet.
The commission says that the DoE has been understanding about the impact on
its activities of the worst recession since the war but it is less
complimentary towards the Treasury, which demands its annual contributions
to the exchequer from new town asset disposals.
According to Sir Neil Shields, commission chairman since 1981, 'it is
questionable whether the Treasury really understands markets at all,
especially the property market. It has failed to appreciate our problems and
tried to insist on impossible targets.'
Sir Neil says that, for three years, the commission has been fighting
against targets so unrealistic that staff morale would have been hammered if
they had been accepted. 'You would demotivate staff and create despondency
and contempt', he adds.
The commission has, as a result, been forced to amend its corporate plan and
to persuade the DoE to accept lower target figures. Even so, it has been
touch and go: 'We have had to work extremely hard in a terrible market,
almost getting to the last week of the financial year before we were sure we
would reach the target', Sir Neil says.
With the current year half completed, the commission expresses confidence
about meeting this year's revised figure, though not without another
struggle. The expectation is that 1992 will generate sale income of between
one half and two-thirds of the 1990 peak.
Despite the pressures on it to perform on asset sales, the commission is
statutorily obliged to strike deals at the best price reasonably obtainable.
According to Mr John Walker, the general manager: 'It is a difficult
balance. In the end, we have to make a judgment about selling now or
waiting, while trying to disengage from new town assets as quickly as we
can.'
Beyond meeting asset disposal targets, the commission's task has recently
been significantly amplified with the transfer into its control of Telford
and Milton Keynes, the last English new town development corporation to be
wound up.
Their inclusion has added huge tracts of additional land to the
organisation's portfolio and handed it a development role which in other
towns had been steadily dwindling.
In Milton Keynes alone, the commission has assumed responsibility for 2,000
acres of housing and commercial land carrying planning permission. Around
one-third of the town remains to be developed, implying the creation of more
than 40,000 jobs and around 20,000 houses  - a challenge equal to developing
from scratch a new town the size of Harlow.
In Telford, a similar acreage of land is also awaiting customers. 'The
chances of selling housing land in Telford in the next couple of years seem
pretty remote. That's the sort of challenge we now face', says Sir Neil.
In response to the challenge, the commission is gearing up the biggest
marketing and promotion initiative in its history. Historically, it has been
successful in competing against the myriad inward investment organisations
for its share of newcomers - more than 1,000 overseas companies are located
in the new towns.
Armed with a Pounds 2.5m budget, the commission is planning a big
promotional push in the Far East and the US, where it has already
established agents to help get its message across to local business
communities.
It believes that it has an edge on some of its British competitors: 'We can
offer 21 locations right across the country. We actually own the land and
buildings we promote and can offer people the prospect of setting up without
any delay,' Sir Neil emphasises.
As at home, however, the success of the commission's global efforts will
largely depend on a prevailing economic climate beyond its control. While
the prospects of a cheaper pound may enhance Britain's status as Europe's
most attractive inward investment location, the spectre of higher inflation
could act as a counter-balance.
If the commission does its job well it could be left with a rump of unwanted
assets sometime after the turn of the century. Whatever remains could then
be auctioned off by government to the highest bidders.
As for the commission, its useful life should then be over. But not
necessarily. As the most successful disposal agency in the public sector, it
could still be given a new lease of life to oversee the orderly disposal of
any other public property assets which a government wanted returned to the
private sector. Those held by the present urban development corporations
might be a candidate.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (3): To wind up an empire
 -Interview, the Commission manager talks to Michael Cassell

THE MORE successful Mr John Walker is at his job, the quicker he will find
himself looking for another.
As general manager of the Commission for New Towns, he is the man charged
with day-to-day responsibility for winding up its Pounds 2bn land and
property empire in England. The faster he fulfils his brief, the closer he
gets to the day when he will have to find alternative employment.
As Sir Neil Shields, the Commission chairman, puts it: 'The co-operation of
our staff has been magnificent. All the time people are basically being
asked to work hard at putting themselves out of a job.'
The property recession means the process of asset disposal and development
is likely to take longer than anyone might have imagined three or four years
ago when deals were queueing up to be signed.
But, even so, the likelihood is that most work will come to an end within
the next decade or so.
According to Mr Walker: 'The finite life of the Commission is an important,
ever-present factor for the staff but they handle it well. People obviously
work against a background of longer-term uncertainty, but where there is any
certainty of employment today?'
Mr Walker, a Mancunian by birth, was appointed to his job at the Commission
in 1991, before he had fully relinquished his responsibilities as deputy
general manager of Milton Keynes, the last new town development corporation
which was wound up earlier this year.
He is fiercely protective of Milton Keynes, which has become the butt of
jokes about soulless suburbia. For a start, he lives there and intends to
keep his home there, even though it means his former, four-minute trip to
work has been replaced by a much lengthier inter-city train and tube
journey.
'There were, and remain, plenty of misconceptions about the place which are
perpetuated by the media. But if we could persuade people to come and see
the town, we reckoned we had done nine-tenths of the job. Business now
recognises Milton Keynes as a complete success story, though many
individuals still have an inaccurate image of it as a place to live.'
Now 44, Mr Walker began his career in local government armed with a graduate
planning diploma but became quickly disillusioned with town hall life and
headed off to see the world.
When he ran out of money, he returned in 1975 and sought job references from
two friends working in Milton Keynes. He took an economic planning post in
the development corporation.
At that time, the new town largely comprised mountains of mud and earth. His
early responsibilities entailed helping to plan for a balanced local
economy, identifying areas for economic growth and devising programmes for
attracting incoming investment.
Mr Walker reckoned he would stay for a couple of years at most. 'I was
open-minded, verging on the sceptical, when it came to new towns, not that I
knew too much about them. I think I had visited Corby once.'
The concept of new towns, however, quickly grew on him and Walker came to
see them as 'a highly relevant response to the mounting urban problems of
the day'.
In 1981, he was appointed director of planning, taking overall charge of
strategic planning for the new town at a critical stage in its development.
Government policy towards the new towns was changing, with the first
Thatcher administration reducing the flow of public funds and encouraging
the private sector to take up the investment momentum.
Milton Keynes itself, however, was already beginning to emerge as a credible
development location for the private sector.
In 1987, Mr Walker was appointed deputy general manager of the development
corporation, the post he held until moving to the commission.
With the commission poised to withdraw steadily from the communities over
which it has had control for up to 30 years, diplomacy will be the order of
the day as local councils regain- some of the authority and responsibilities
taken from them in recent years.
Mr Walker acknowledges that another generation of new towns is unlikely,
although they have provided plenty of examples of best practice in urban
planning which remain to be utilised elswhere.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (1): From vision to
reality - Britain's biggest post-war initiative in social planning was the
creation of 28 new towns to rehouse people from the squalor of the large
city slums. Michael Cassell draws an end of century balance sheet of their
achievements and drawbacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the last of Britain's new town development corporations was wound
up six months ago, the arguments rumble on over whether the planners'
original vision for giving millions of people a fresh start and a better
quality of life was inspired or misconceived.
To the supporters of the new towns movement, whose principles reach back
nearly 500 years to the urban squalor of Elizabethan England, its post-war
progress represents a triumph in humane planning which remains equally valid
today.
They argue that the new towns - originally conceived as safety valves to
relieve congestion in London and to reduce pressure for green belt
development - more than met their ambitious objectives. Their subsequent
spread to most parts of the nation provides, they say, further physical
proof of their value and appeal.
From Hemel Hempstead and Hatfield to Bracknell and Basildon, improved living
conditions and employment opportunities were extended to people previously
assumed to be inextricably bogged down in the grind of inner-city life.
In effect, many lower income families were able to swap run-down tenements
and filthy air for open spaces, greenery and smart new homes.
An ever-present guiding principle was that a better physical environment
offered not only visual and environmental advantages but could also help
determine the very well-being of the individuals concerned.
The theory was not always sustained by the reality, at least in the
short-term. The mass relocation of old, if disadvantaged, communities into
unfamiliar surroundings replaced established social problems with fresh
dilemmas.
There were no pubs or meeting places and many of the early pioneers quickly
began to pine for the noisy neighbours and the shabby streets.
A sense of alienation and dislocation often flourished as the planners
struggled to achieve their objectives. Their mistakes were invariably made
at the expense of those who were unwittingly participating in the planners'
bold experiment; many of the social problems indelibly linked with the inner
city were replaced by new ones in the countryside.
Financially, the first generation of new towns, such as Aycliffe, Corby,
Peterlee and Welwyn Garden City, were deemed to be a success, with surpluses
regularly generated from the subsequent disposal of property assets.
Later towns, such as Runcorn, Skelmersdale, Peterborough, Warrington and
Milton Keynes (the last new town development corporation to be wound up in
England), were less successful financially.
Some of them were less favourably located and also suffered from a shift in
government policy in favour of directing more funds towards the inner
cities. The cumulative impact of financing revenue deficits at high rates of
interest did not help. Neither did the towns always succeed in generating a
sufficiently large and diverse economic mix to sustain their expanding
populations. While some of the early towns were accused of having overlooked
the rising car population, the later ones were criticised for having
relegated human beings to second place behind the motor car.
Even so, there are those who persist in making out a well-constructed case
for the development of another generation of new towns to add to the 28
developed in England, Scotland and Wales.
They point out that the format, far from being exhausted or rendered
obsolete by fresh political priorities, could still provide a partial
solution to Britain's pressing housing and urban problems.
The 1991 census figures have led the Department of the Environment to
estimate that nearly 3m new dwellings will be needed in Britain by 2011, a
total equivalent to the number of existing homes in the greater London area.
Advocates of more new towns claim that such a requirement cannot possibly be
met from development within existing cities.
The Town and Country Planning Association supports those who claim there
remains a strategic necessity for some newly-established population centres.
It believes more new towns could relieve the heightening development
pressures on existing population centres and help prevent the blight of
continuous urban sprawl.
A revised new towns programme to continue their development into the next
century has been called for.
The only significant initiative intended to resurrect the new town concept
in recent years came from the private sector with the formation in 1983 of
the ill-fated Consortium Developments, backed by many of Britain's biggest
house builders.
The group spoke enthusiastically of a mission to develop up to 200 new towns
and villages offering a balance of housing and commercial life.
But in spite of encouraging noises from a succession of ministers, the
consortium failed to win approval for any of its proposals. The final straw
came at the beginning of this year when the Department of the Environment
overturned its inspector's recommendation that a new village of 1,500 homes
should go ahead in Cambridgeshire.
Consortium Developments withdrew, disillusioned with the planning system and
critical of a government which it said had completely abdicated
responsibility and left decisions to the vagaries of local politics. Some
organisations, such as the Council for the Protection of Rural England, were
glad to see it go.
The government may not have entirely closed the door on the prospect of more
new towns - Mr Michael Heseltine, the former Environment Secretary, has
hinted that a corridor of new towns could be developed to the east of London
as part of a strategy to revive the area's economy.
It is clear, however, that the thrust of government policy for the
foreseeable future will centre on the need for inner city revival, to be
spearheaded by the new Urban Regeneration Agency.
The agency will take over the administration of the DoE's Pounds 4bn urban
programme and will have extensive powers to develop tracts of derelict land
which have so far defied both public and private sectors.
As for the new towns, some have undeniably acted as local economic 'engine
rooms' and provided a magnet for many overseas businesses establishing
operations in Britain to gain access to EC markets.
The Commission for New Towns, which is responsible for disposal of new town
assets and for completing their development, says that more than 1,000
overseas companies have taken advantage of the conditions they offer.
The Commission is hopeful that any improvement in Britain's exporting
performance, brought about by the decline in the value of sterling, will
bring in still more overseas companies to the 21 English towns under its
temporary control.
The organisation now has a decade or more of life left in which it has to
oversee the orderly run-down of the new town organisations and to return the
assets left in their wake to the community which originally financed them.
With a booming property market for most of the 1980s putting a fair wind
behind it, the Commission took a pride in meeting, without fail, its
asset-disposal targets.
The remaining challenge of complete disengagement looks considerably more
daunting, given the recession and its damaging impact on values and
activity.
The Commission is in no doubt over the new town movement's historic success
or the attractiveness of the communities it leaves behind.
But critics are equally adamant that the legacy is an unwelcome one and that
any suggestion of another generation coming forward must never be allowed to
take root.
Opponents talk of a failed, discredited, experiment in social engineering
which cannot be repeated. Some support the views encapsulated in a leading
article published in The Times to coincide with the 25th anniversary earlier
this year of Milton Keynes, perhaps the most controversial of all the new
towns.
The Buckinghamshire new town was described as 'the last, desperate throw of
a generation of British planners who were distasteful of the traditional
British towns and cities and had the political power and public money to
fashion the environment to their will'.
According to like-minded critics, the new town movement was idealistic and
authoritarian and, as importantly, contributed directly towards the decline
and dereliction which today scars many of Britain's urban areas.
Residents, moved against their will into new environments with poor
services, were seen as being at the mercy of the architect, while the
countryside was despoiled and original settlements smothered.
The experts will doubtless continue to argue over the merits and drawbacks
of Britain's biggest post-war initiative in social planning.
But Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, one of the original new town planners, may be
close to the truth when he says that, whatever the early failures, he doubts
if many people who left Britain's cities for a better life would now wish to
return to their old, inner-city slums or to a new high-rise flat.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Tradition meets the new
realism - The issues surrounding the future of the party's union links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S debate on the links between the party and its affiliated trade
unions was merely the public prelude to weeks of intense private debate.
Out of that private debate will come - probably in the new year - a report
on reforming the links, with huge implications for the party's finances,
membership, policy-making and, above all, its ethos and public image.
The trade unions provide just over half of Labour's financial resources and
from next year will cast 70 per cent of votes at the conference which,
supplemented by various policy forums, nominally decides policy.
Those 'block' votes are based on the 4.5m union members who do not contract
out of paying a political levy to the party with their union dues and who
dwarf the 260,000 individual members from the constituency parties.
Although links between unions and parties of the left are common throughout
the industrial world, the link in this country is one of the most intimate,
based on the fact that the unions founded the party and then with their
block votes succeeded in moderating the excesses of left-wing members.
Also, short of state funding for political parties or the creation of a
'mass' party - both highly improbable in the near future - Labour will
continue to need a lot of union cash if it is to compete effectively with
the Conservatives.
But critics of the links believe the party can now manage without the
unions' political presence. They believe affiliated unions are a sectional
interest group - representing less than a quarter of British workers - and,
especially in the south-east, helping to associate Labour with the past.
There has been no groundswell of support for a complete separation, and
union influence within the party is so entrenched that even shadow ministers
who might have led moves to divorce - such as Mr Tony Blair or Mr Gordon
Brown - have had to disguise their real views.
Some people even detect a slight retreat from the mildly reformist proposals
that the leaders of the big unions seemed ready to accept a few weeks ago,
such as complete withdrawal from the electoral college to elect the leader
and from the local block vote in constituency parties.
'We do not need a revolution, we do not need a divorce, we don't even need
separate beds,' says Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, who
inadvertantly launched the post-election debate on union power in the party
through his television anointment of Mr John Smith as the new leader days
after the election defeat.
The make-up of the party's union link review body, where the private debate
will now take place, also rules out a radical break, although it may be
pushed slightly further than it wants to go by reformers in the shadow
cabinet.
Nonetheless, there is a wide consensus supporting the view that the links
must be made more democratically legitimate and that the corporate clout of
the unions, epitomised by the block vote, must be replaced with a new
relationship to individual levy-paying trade unionists.
Well over half of the 'phantom army' of the 4.5m levy payers vote Labour but
a large minority do not and yet their votes are still counted at Labour
conferences. At the heart of the review group's deliberations will be the
question of how to represent these levy payers more defensibly.
Several ideas are being canvassed. One of the most popular is to offer levy
payers full membership or possibly 'associate membership' of the party,
which would allow them to participate without any extra payment.
The obstacle to giving levy-paying members the same rights as ordinary
members is that the average levy payer contributes less than Pounds 2 a year
and individual members pay Pounds 15. If fees were harmonised, as proposed
by Mr Graham Allen MP, it would probably require a cut in the contribution
rate which might not be covered by extra members.
Drawing attention to the political levy might also cause more people to
exercise their right to 'opt out' or attract hostile attention from the
government.
How far will the review cut the union vote at conference - the most visible
manifestation of union power in the party?
Over the past five years the unions have spent less than half of the money
they raise through the levy on the Labour party. If the conference votes
were linked to the proportion of the party's costs that the unions now
cover, the union proportion of the vote would fall to just over 50 per cent.
The review body may cut the union vote to slightly below 50 per cent. But
the political trick, according to Mr Neil Stewart, a former adviser to Mr
Neil Kinnock, is to switch the flow of union cash to fund elections alone.
'The voters do not believe Labour can speak for the whole country if unions
provide its running costs but they do believe that general elections would
be unfair contests without union contributions,' he says.
Stewart does not believe that a mass party can be created by converting more
levy payers into members or by cutting membership fees (which will be
experimented with in a few constituencies). He points out that shop stewards
are the key to increased membership among union members and they are usually
keen to appear non-party so as not to alienate non-Labour voters.
Instead, if membership income and donations are to rise to cover more of the
party's costs, Stewart says the membership fee will have to go up to Pounds
30. That would confirm the fears of many Labour trade unionists that the
party is intent on cutting its links with the working class. The evidence of
yesterday's debate is that they have nothing to fear.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Gould attacks housing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR turned up the rhetoric in its denunciation of government housing
policy yesterday, as Mr Bryan Gould made his farewell address from the
conference platform.
Mr Gould appealed passionately to the government to allow local councils to
use billions of pounds of capital receipts in their possession to build
council houses.
'This is a problem literally on our own doorstep which we can solve if we
have the political will to do so,' he said.
Mr Gould received a warm reception, just 48 hours after learning he had been
voted off the national executive committee, Labour's ruling body.
The former shadow heritage secretary also indicated that he felt Labour
could have made more of housing as an issue in the general election
campaign.
'In my view, it was the issue on which the Tories were most vulnerable,' he
said. The 'mess' the government had made of housing was responsible for much
'sheer unadulterated personal misery'.
Mr Gould was joined by Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, who also
hit out at Conservative housing policies. What was needed was a 'relentless
crusade' to stand up for the homeless and ill-housed, he said. The council
tax - due to be introduced next year - would prove to be 'almost as great a
fiasco' as its predecessor, the poll tax.
Earlier, Mr Straw had claimed that of Pounds 6.5bn in local-authority hands
from the sale of council homes an 'astonishing' Pounds 5.1bn had been frozen
by Conservative legislation and could not be spent on housing investment.
Delegates backed a broad motion condemning government housing policy across
the board and setting out a blueprint of measures for Labour, including a
mortgage rescue scheme and steps to ensure that housing associations enjoyed
similar rights to council tenants.
They also urged the NEC to 'organise a vigorous, effective and forceful
campaign against implementation of the council tax'.
In a debate on Labour's organisation in rural constituencies, the leadership
was urged to regard forthcoming boundary changes - which are expected to
favour the Conservatives - as an incentive to step up its efforts in such
seats. For years, prominent Labour figures had been 'as rare in rural areas
as farmers voting Labour', according to one speaker.
Conference approved a motion noting with concern 'the negative attitude of
the leadership, the national executive committee and the party organisation
towards rural voters and non-key seats in the run-up to and during the
general election'.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Block vote for unions cut to
70%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday agreed the first significant cut for 70 years in the trade
unions' ability to control conference, reducing the controversial block vote
from nearly 90 per cent to 70 per cent of the total.
The chief beneficiaries of the change are individual party members in the
constituency parties, who will see their voting power next year rise from 12
per cent to 30 per cent.
But the hopes of a reformist faction to push through a one-member, one-vote
system for the selection of MPs and the election of the party leader will
have to await a review.
After a rare outbreak of passionate debate, which also saw the first
heckling of the week, the conference voted by an overwhelming majority to
let a national executive committee working party draw up its own proposals.
Speaking for the NEC, Mr Richard Rosser made clear that the leadership's
policy continued to favour the one-member, one-vote system for parliamentary
selections and an end to the process being obligatory.
However, opposition in the hall suggested that some unions will continue to
resist the change, which would end their rights to participate through
electoral colleges.
In a lengthy and often confused debate, which included pressure for
all-women selection lists to raise the number of female MPs, delegate after
delegate reaffirmed their faith in the links between the unions and the
party they formed nearly a century ago.
There were also clear differences between those who wish to see no
significant reforms and those who would like to make the relationship with
the unions informal, with their powers replaced in the organisation by a
party controlled by individual members.
Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, steered a delicate path
between the two camps by drumming up support for the review group.
He said the working party would 'modernise' the relationship, legitimise the
union role in the minds of the public at large, remove abuses and help to
win the statutory political fund ballots.
He argued that the unions, both through funding and as a force for
stability, tempering extremism, had kept Labour 'in touch with reality'.
Traditionalists were more vocal, with one delegate warning that the
consequences of a party based purely on individual membership would be to
turn Labour into 'a middle-class pressure group'.
Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU transport union, argued for the working
party, but made clear that he believed reforms should be limited, insisting
that there was no evidence the issue had any bearing on Labour's election
defeat.
The modernisers disagreed, saying the public display of union influence in
Mr John Smith's election as leader had damaged the party's image. One, Mr
Mohammed Afzal, once involved in a fierce dispute with the electricians'
union over his attempt to become a party candidate, claimed that he would be
appearing as an MP had the unions not intervened.
A series of card votes meant that final decisions on the motions will not be
known until conference resumes today. However, there are few doubts that,
with the help of the union block vote, the NEC's positions will be upheld.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Left wing takes pride in
isolation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THIS year's conference was meant to be an occasion for soul-searching, it
is perhaps the left wing of the Labour party that has most to contemplate.
Mr Dennis Skinner, the proudly 'working class' MP for Bolsover, lost his
place on the ruling national executive committee. Mr Tony Benn, the veteran
left-wing MP for Chesterfield, is now isolated on the committee.
Hard-left resolutions - on state ownership, Europe, union laws - have been
rejected without inflicting even a moment's anxiety on the party leadership,
when they reached the agenda at all. The larger trade unions are now most
notable for their support of the rightwing leadership.
At a fringe meeting of the Campaign group of leftwing supporters and MPs, Mr
Skinner made light of his exile from the NEC. There were old-fashioned
banners, a chorus of the Red Flag and two standing ovations for Mr Skinner.
'Our people understand that a minor defeat on the NEC is not the be all and
end all. You win the real battles on the street,' he said.
But who 'our people' are is a legitimate question for a disillusioned
leftwinger. They are certainly not the large numbers of constituency members
who voted for Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown - bitterly referred to as
the 'golden boys' - who replaced Mr Skinner on the executive. Campaign group
MPs ignore the code of neat haircuts and well-tailored suits that their
ambitious colleagues appear to regard as mandatory.
They are not the people who told market researchers that they did not trust
Labour on tax and other issues and who Mr John Smith, party leader, is
anxious to reassure.
Many of the left wing's natural supporters might not even be Labour members
 -having been expelled or having resigned during the clampdown in the 1980s.
Yet the indefatigable optimism of the left has not diminished. The Campaign
group's rally was enthusiastic - as much for reminiscences of the good old
times of successful strikes and demonstrations as for what lay ahead. There
was standing room only at the back of the hall.
In his speech, Mr Benn said events of this week had to be seen in
'historical perspective'. Other long-standing party members said they had
been through bad times before, but the cycle had come round. During this bad
time, while support among MPs is low, they are looking for new supporters in
the party or on its fringes to carry on the work.
Some leftwingers find they can work within the system. One is Ms Dawn
Primarolo, the MP for Bristol South, who also addressed the rally. She takes
over the chair of the Campaign group this autumn, and has just been
appointed a shadow health minister.
Others, however, almost relish their isolation. Mr Skinner says he prefers
the attitude of ordinary, Labour-voting holidaymakers - not party members
but Labour voters - who accost him on Blackpool's seafront to tell him to,
'keep up the good work in parliament'. They are unaware of the internal
party politics that have set Mr Skinner back this week.
As Mr Skinner wanders around the conference hall he takes cheer from
delegates who say how sorry they were that he lost his seat. Most say they
voted for him. He doesn't ask for proof.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Fees rise follows computer
troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARTY'S much-criticised national membership scheme came under fire in
Blackpool yesterday as conference approved a 20 per cent increase in annual
membership subscriptions.
The rise from Pounds 15 to Pounds 18 was accompanied by a smaller increase
in affiliation fees submitted by trade unions.
The increases had been portrayed by Labour's ruling national executive
committee as a stopgap measure to address the party's pressing financial
difficulties.
Although a motion calling for the membership system to be decentralised to
the regions was eventually defeated, the platform had first to endure a
succession of floor speakers rising to condemn existing arrangements as
inefficient.
One critic argued that the scheme had brought Labour's Walworth Road
headquarters into 'disrepute'.
Another said the party had been sold a supposedly 'all singing, all dancing'
computer system that in fact could not work, as it was based on postcodes
which 'cannot adequately identify' constituencies or branch parties.
Arguing against decentralisation, Ms Diana Jeuda, an NEC member, said that
regionalising the scheme was more likely to multiply difficulties than
resolve them.
She admitted, however, that some grievances were justified: 'I did wonder if
I should bring a tin hat,' she said.
While one motion selected for debate spoke about the 'chronic problems'
associated with the national membership system and another said the switch
to the central computer had proved 'seriously flawed', Mr Eddie Haigh, for
the NEC, told delegates that lessons had been learned.
There had been delays in dealing with membership applications but steps had
been taken to correct that and other faults.
'Despite all the problems, the system has already brought real benefits. For
the first time we know who our members are,' he said.
'We have a national register, which means we can contact every individual
member direct.'
Conference agreed to remit a motion calling for the NEC to conduct 'a proper
pilot scheme into mass membership', on the ground that it contained wording
that would have broken the party's formal link with the trade unions.

   A SWITCH in Labour's health policy towards a pledge to adapt
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
rather than simply reverse - many of the government's reforms was signalled
yesterday by Mr David Blunkett, the party's new health spokesman.
Speaking to the conference, he hinted that much of the party's policy during
the general election, including its promise to scrap the newly created
self-governing hospital trusts, will be replaced.
Rejection of the GP fund-holding programme is likely to continue.
Mr Blunkett said he wanted to 'begin discussions' within the party on how to
rebuild the National Health Service, speaking of recreating the NHS 'in a
new world, with a new agenda for change'.
Speaking to journalists afterwards, Mr Blunkett said he did not want to rule
out any proposals for adapting trust hospitals to meet Labour's objectives.
That might include giving local authorities a role in hospital management or
changing the responsibilities of district health authorities.
He was keen to keep the principle of decentralisation but wanted a greater
emphasis on accountability to local communities and on preventive health
care - including links between health and housing and unemployment.
After the party's election defeat, there would have to be a reappraisal of
what a future incoming Labour government would inherit, Mr Blunkett said.
'We can't go backwards, we certainly can't accept what the Conservatives
have left us.'
Replying to a debate dominated by attacks on the government's health policy,
Mr Blunkett blamed government policy on homes, jobs, the economy and the
environment for 'worsening our health and quality of life'.
He said that in no other area of politics was the difference between
democratic socialism and the Tories' 'market dogma' as clear.
'Where there should be care, we have competition. Where there should be
service, we have the salesman's pitch, the internal market, the GP
fund-holder, a two-tier health service,' he said. 'Tens of thousands of
people forced into the private sector by Tory policy.'
Far from waiting lists being cut, Mr Blunkett said that under the
Conservative government they had increased by 130 a day since the general
election.
It was time for a new agenda to reveal the 'real inequality that exists in
our country' by comparing Britain's health spending with that of other
countries in the world.
He complained that the government was refusing to join with other European
countries in insisting on stronger health warnings on cigarette packets and
a wider ban on advertising because of the donations by tobacco companies to
the Conservative party. 'No wonder they call Mrs Bottomley 'Golden
Virginia',' he said.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Floor revolts over pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE leadership suffered its first defeat of the conference yesterday when
delegates voted overwhelmingly to back a big rise in the state pension.
In a rare act of defiance, conference rejected a recommendation by the
national executive and supported increasing the state retirement pension for
a couple to a level equivalent to half average gross earnings in the UK.
Although embarrassing, the result does not commit Mr John Smith to adopting
the motion as official policy. Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security
spokesman, said he was 'not disconcerted' and that such a pension increase
was a reasonable long-term aspiration.
The motion agreed by conference also called for moves towards equality in
retirement ages to be achieved by reducing the normal retirement age for men
 -and not at the expense of women's entitlement. Labour's official policy is
to back a 'flexible decade' of retirement.
Delegates also wanted the introduction of pensions for all women, to be paid
from their 60th birthday, regardless of the age of their partner. Measures
were also proposed in the motion to protect pension funds from Maxwell-style
robberies.
Moving the motion, Mr Des Andrews, of the Usdaw shop-workers' union, accused
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, of 'robbing' pensioners.
'The money that was taken, we want back at the earliest opportunity,' he
said.
'If any government tries to make our women work until they are 65 before
they get a pension, my union will be out on the streets, I can guarantee.'
Replying, Ms Brenda Etchells, an NEC member, said policies set out in the
motion pre-empted the results of the commission on social justice planned by
the party leadership. It could also result in overcompensating women
pensioners and discrimination against men.
But she launched an attack on the government's failure to support
pensioners, particularly in comparison with other European Community
countries.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Inflation renews its threat: The reactions in engineering to
devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE devaluation of sterling has brought a welcome impetus to the
competitiveness of British engineering companies in export markets. But the
threat of more expensive imports has revived worries about stoking
inflation.
The six engineering companies that feature in an occasional FT series
tracking the sector's performance believe the boost to exports should
benefit the whole UK economy.
Some, though, feel that last week's cut in base rates of 1 percentage point
was either not enough, or needs to be accompanied by other measures to
stimulate manufacturing industry or infrastructural spending without
depressing the pound further.
Above all, they do not want to see sterling quite as low as it is now.
'Maybe DM2.95 was too high, but I'm damned sure it is too low at around
DM2.50,' says Mr John Bell, chief executive of Senior Engineering Group. 'At
the end of the day we'll get a high inflation rate back.'
Many UK engineering companies echo the views of Mr Peter Burton, chief
executive of Walsall-based Bloxwich Engineering, that sterling entered the
European exchange rate mechanism at too high a rate. Even so, there are
strong pleas for an eventual return to a stabilised currency system such as
the ERM.
Mr Peter Barker, chairman of Fenner, says: 'I don't believe a floating pound
is right for Britain in the long term.'
Mr Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman of JCB, says: 'There is a need for
currency stability, and the easiest way is through the ERM.' But the rules
need to be clarified. 'There has to be something very wrong in the ERM's
structure when all this has happened through the sheer movement of funds,'
he says.
With few, if any, signs yet of recovery in their domestic markets, the
companies with strong export markets are determined to make the most of the
unexpected stimulus from devaluation. Larger companies such as Fenner, which
has three manufacturing plants in the US, will benefit from profit
translation and a substantial revaluation of US assets. A lower pound 'must
be helpful' for exporting into Europe, Mr Barker says, although he
emphasises that not everybody in British engineering was uncompetitive at
DM2.95. For companies such as JCB, with strong market shares in Europe, the
effective devaluation may not represent a 'massive opportunity' in volume
terms but will make a difference to margins, according to Mr Johnston.
Several companies also pointed out the benefits from the fall in the pound
against the dollar. 'The dollar rate was far too high, it was nearly
impossible to sell into the US,' says Mr Burton. 'And because other
currencies were tied in with the dollar, we had great difficulty selling
into the Pacific Rim, too.'
At 600 Group, Dr Colin Gaskell, the managing director, hopes selling into
the US will be much easier with a weaker pound.
'Through our own operation,' he says, 'we can improve margins or cut prices
 -whichever is better to improve returns. That is useful in a market such as
the US where price is critical.'
The effect is reversed, of course, for importers. One of the FT Six, Posiva,
imports its products from its German parent, and has moved quickly to decide
on its tactics, says Mr Reg Bricknell, chief executive. 'We don't expect to
make any increases in prices - the market would not bear it,' he says.
'We'll have to absorb as much of the difference as we can, and are looking
at whether we can become even more efficient, source more in the UK, or do
more ourselves.'
Other companies that import products for sale in the UK, or have competitors
that import, believe that at least in the short term the effect of the
devaluation will be absorbed rather than passed on to customers through
price increases.
Mr Burton adds that eventually foreign competitors will have to raise prices
to protect their margins.
Mr Bell expresses concern that engineering companies such as Senior might
find some import costs - such as for raw materials - rising, while UK
customers refuse to accept price increases.
Mr Bricknell points out that a general rise in inflation is more dependent
on trends in the high street such as the purchase of foreign consumer
electronics than on price rises in manufacturing industry.
Dr Gaskell says the 1-point cut in interest rates has at least ended a
damaging 'hiatus' during which talk of higher rates had a negative effect on
customer confidence. Mr Bell says the fear of rekindling inflation underpins
the caution at most of the FT Six about deep cuts in interest rates.
That is why other solutions to stimulating the economy are suggested. Mr
Bell wants incentives from the government to spur investments by industry.
Mr Johnston at JCB opts for a programme of public works and increased
spending on the infrastructure.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Talks lift hope for Maxwell pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTESTED CLAIMS on assets in the Maxwell business empire totalling at least
Pounds 100m may be resolved in out-of-court settlements negotiated with the
help of the government's Maxwell pensions unit, it emerged yesterday.
Sir John Cuckney, head of the unit, which works on behalf of the pensioners
to recover assets, said that at least four parties involved in both sides of
a series of contested actions had approached him for help.
He said that the trust set up by the government to collect donations to help
plug the hole of stolen assets - which is also headed by Sir John  - had
raised sufficient money to pay full entitlements to all the Maxwell
pensioners for at least three years.
The unit hopes to save time and legal fees by avoiding court cases that may
take several years to resolve and consume money that might otherwise go to
the pension funds.
Sir John emphasised that discussions were still at a very early stage. 'We
have barely started the hors d'oeuvres,' he said. The unit's role would be
simply a co-ordinating one.
He said that the trust would have received about Pounds 5.75m by the end of
this week, after the receipt of one imminent donation for about Pounds
250,000. There has also been a Pounds 2.5m contribution from the Department
of Social Security.
Contributions to the trust had ranged in size 'from Pounds 6 from a
pensioner to six-digits'. Goldman Sachs - the US merchant bank that carried
out a number of share dealings with the Maxwell companies - has confirmed
that it has made a substantial donation, believed to be about Pounds 1m.
Sir John said there had been 'a reasonable number' of donations from
organisations that had conducted business with the Maxwell companies. He
added that there had been 'some disappointment' at the level of
contributions from the City, and he was changing the focus of his
fund-raising to concentrate on those groups.
He emphasised that donations did not imply guilt from companies that did
business with Robert Maxwell and added that there was no question of
donations as 'hush money' in lieu of potential litigation.
Some existing contributors had pledged more money in the future, he said,
and other potential donors were holding back until there was a clearer view
of how much money would be needed. He was reluctant to give a target because
there was a risk of loss of credibility if it was not made - but he expected
it to ultimately be 'in the tens of millions'.
Sir John said that after meetings with the insolvency practitioners he was
personally satisfied with the levels of fees being charged.
The trust has paid about Pounds 1.5m to Maxwell pensioners since the end of
June. It has also helped to ease the progress of matters relating to the
Maxwell pensioners within Whitehall, resolving difficulties in agencies
including the DSS and the Inland Revenue.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Rise in Scottish jobless forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT IN Scotland is likely to rise from 243,000 to a peak of 282,000
next year, then fall slowly fall back to 255,000 in 1996, according to a
monthly economic review published yesterday.
The Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, Scotland's main
economic study organisation, said people could already expect to stay out of
work longer. It called for government measures to tackle the issue.
It said: 'The return of something like the former Community Programme is
urgently needed, especially in the urban and other areas where high and
persistent unemployment and long-term employment prevails.
'This would provide direction and purpose to those who presently have no
chance of participating in the formal labour market, and help avoid the
adverse social consequences of sustained job-lessness.'
It predicted that demand in the Scottish economy would rally in the second
half of this year, but recovery would not become strongly rooted until next
year.
The recent turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism would stimulate
the real economy, but rising unemployment in July and August suggested that
any 'significant' upturn would not take place before next year, the
institute added.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey shows output at low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING output is at its lowest level for more than a year and new
orders remain weak, according to a survey of UK purchasing managers
published yesterday.
The survey showed that the purchasing managers' index - based on a weighted
average of the movements of a number of variables - fell to 45.1 per cent
last month from 45.4 per cent in August and 48 per cent in July.
The Institute of Purchasing and Supply said the fifth successive monthly
fall confirmed suspicions that the recession was 'far from over'.
The survey, based on US techniques, was started in July last year, so has
yet to establish a known record. The index covers variables such as new
orders, output and employment.
The latest results showed that output was at its lowest level since the
survey began. 'It is clear from the survey data that the low level recorded
cannot be explained by seasonal or other special factors and is simply a
reflection of low levels of demand,' the institute said yesterday.
The indices measuring the quantity of purchases, suppliers' delivery times,
stocks of finished goods and employment all fell, reflecting depressed
market conditions. The prices index rose slightly.

FT  01 OCT 92 / SFO man jailed over BCCI leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACCOUNTANT working on the Serious Fraud Office inquiry into the collapsed
Bank of Credit and Commerce International was jailed for three years
yesterday after being convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of
justice by trying to sell confidential papers from the inquiry to a
solicitor acting for a suspect.
Mr Mark Braley, 25, of Hayes, west London, a former Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte accountant, had committed 'a quite extraordinary and serious breach
of trust', Judge Rivlin QC told the Old Bailey.
His disloyalty and greed, when he had been warned of the need for absolute
confidentiality, had placed the SFO's massive BCCI investigation at risk,
the judge said.
Mr Braley's accomplice, Mr Bernard Lynch, a freelance accountant, of Forest
Hill, south London, was also sentenced to three years' imprisonment after
being convicted of the same offence.
The judge said Mr Lynch was the instigator of the conspiracy to sell highly
sensitive documents to Mr Michael Barrett, a solicitor acting for Mr Syed
Akbar, a former BCCI official arrested in France and now the subject of
extradition proceedings.
'You knew full well what you were doing and you relished the consternation
and damage being caused,' the judge told Mr Lynch. Although the two men had
received only Pounds 1,000 from Mr Barrett they had seen the SFO information
as a 'very rich gold seam' to be tapped.
During the trial, the court heard the two men had tried to sell 70 pages of
confidential documents to Mr Barrett.
However, after his first contact with Mr Lynch, Mr Barrett called the
police. He then assisted them in an operation to identify Mr Braley as the
source of the SFO leak.
After several meetings between Mr Barrett and Mr Lynch, secretly
tape-recorded by the solicitor, Mr Braley was lured to a meeting in a London
hotel, where he was arrested.
The two men were also given two-year sentences after admitting conspiring to
corruptly obtain a consideration from Mr Barrett. Mr Braley received a
further two-year sentence after admitting the theft of four bearer share
certificates from customs investigators. The sentences all run concurrently.

PUBLIC utilities are unacceptably bad at handling consumers' complaints,
according to the latest issue of Which?, the Consumers' Association
magazine.
A survey of subscribers that had complained to utilities found that British
Telecom and British Rail were worst at handling complaints, but no utility
came out well. For every utility more people were dissatisfied with the
handling of their complaint than were satisfied.

<TEXT>
FORD, the leader of the UK new car market, is launching a satellite business
television service for its UK dealer network, Kevin Done writes.
Regular weekly programmes will be broadcast to the majority of Ford's 400
main and 600 retail dealers.
The system is designed to become the main source of business information for
Ford dealers in the future. The network should be fully operational by the
end of the year.
The programmes, which will cover marketing, sales and administrative issues,
will be created and supplied by Imagination, a London-based design and
communications agency.
Ford already operates an internal television news service, Ford
Communication Network, to link its plants and offices.
The business television system will allow dealer staff to raise questions
with Ford management during live broadcasts using a telephone link.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Pressure from EC improves job rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government, under pressure from the European Commission, is to change
the law to give more employment rights to some public-sector workers.
The move will give more legal protection to workers who lose their jobs or
are re-hired on worse terms when local-authority work is contracted out.
Under the 1981 British transfer regulations, passed to comply with an EC
directive, employers must honour the employment contracts they inherit when
they take over or merge with other commercial ventures. However, when
public-sector or other non-profit-making organisations change hands,
contracts are considered terminated.
The commission argues that the government is failing to enforce the
directive fully and has begun proceedings to take the UK to the European
court.
The government has now agreed to add an amendment to its planned employment
bill, due in the next parliamentary session, to extend the protection to all
workers.
The main effect is expected to be to benefit those employees are adversely
affected by contracting-out of local-government work under the
compulsory-tendering procedure.
Councils have lost 38,414 jobs as a result of tendering since March 1987,
according to the Local Government Management Board. A further 2,000 jobs are
expected to be removed from direct employment by March.
The proposed law may deter some private contractors from bidding for
contracts. Companies have been attracted by the contracts partly because
they have been free to cut wage costs.
The proposed law will compel employers to consult representatives of the
workforce before any transfer of ownership or control.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Burning midnight oil in case against auditors: The latest
leg of the battle to recover money for creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIGHTS are burning late into the night in City offices this week as the
liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
prepare the latest salvo in their attempt to recover money for creditors.
Lawyers and accountants have been working long hours putting the final
touches to a 'statement of claim' detailing charges likely to top Dollars
8bn (Pounds 4.6bn) against the two accountancy firms that were auditors to
BCCI in 1986.
Ernst &amp; Whinney - now part of Ernst &amp; Young - and Price Waterhouse were both
served with brief writs expressed in general terms last March. The
statements of claim shortly to arrive will go into far more detail.
Neither firm had received copies late yesterday, but under the court-agreed
timetable the statements were required to be lodged by the end of today.
They represent the next stage in a battle that will probably take at least
five years to reach the courts - if it makes it that far.
'These are vexatious actions with Mickey Mouse numbers on them,' said one
partner. Publicly, Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse were yesterday putting
a brave face on the allegations.
PW said: 'We are confident that the work of all of the PW people involved in
the BCCI audit was carried out to the highest professional standards.'
Both firms have said they intend to contest the legal action.
Ernst &amp; Young is also likely to argue that it was auditor to parts of BCCI
that were not the source of the fraud, and that it relied on the work of PW
as auditor to those which were.
PW has already spent more than Dollars 10m in legal fees to prepare a
defence. Ernst &amp; Young has spent about Pounds 1m. Some partners are
expressing private unease over the prospect of litigation that could make
them personally bankrupt.
The largest cases of claims for damages in which payments have been made
public include Pounds 50m against Arthur Young - now part of Ernst &amp; Whinney
 -in connection with Johnson Matthey Bankers in 1989, and Pounds 40m last
year from KPMG Peat Marwick in respect of Ferranti's acquisition of ISC.
When the big accountancy firms agree to a legal settlement, payment comes
from a variety of sources. The first few million dollars is paid directly
from the firm's own resources. Some may also be shared between international
partnerships.
External professional indemnity insurers will then provide cover for many
tens of millions more, although growing claims and sharply rising premiums
have made that cover increasingly difficult to obtain affordably in the last
few years.
In addition, the Big Six firms are all members of two secretive mutual
insurance companies based in Bermuda. One is called Pail (Professional
Assets Indemnity Ltd), and the other Padua (named after the Italian city for
some time credited as the birthplace of double-entry bookkeeping). These two
mutuals both plug certain 'gaps' in the cover offered by external insurers,
and extend it beyond the levels to which they are willing to underwrite
risk. That covers the firms up to about Dollars 110m.
The firms typically also have their own individual 'captive' insurers, which
might bring the total level of cover to about Dollars 150m. Beyond that, the
partners themselves - as the owners of the firms - are individually liable
up to the total value of their assets.
The firms emphasise that the likelihood of a settlement that would bankrupt
partners is infinitesimally small. They also hope that the government of Abu
Dhabi, the BCCI majority shareholder, will not want to risk scrutiny of its
role by bringing the matter to court.
But one professional involved in the preparation of the statement of claim
said: 'Brian Smouha would not bring a claim unless there were very serious
grounds for action.'

FT  01 OCT 92 / Clothing and engineering form industry lobby groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS in Britain's fragmented textiles and clothing industries are
joining forces from today in a new body, the British Apparel and Textiles
Confederation (BATC).
They want to raise their industries' lobbying power at a time when the
international trading agreements - General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
and Multi-Fibre Arrangement - are being renegotiated.
Also in London yesterday an industrial pressure group aimed at reversing
almost 50 years of decline in Britain's manufacturing and engineering
industries was launched.
It is called the UK Industrial Group and it expects to draw its membership
from mainly small to medium-sized manufacturing companies.
The British Apparel and Textiles Confederation is the largest such
organisation in Europe, according to Mr John Wilson, its director-general.
Its size partly compensates for the fact that the textile and clothing
industry has shrunk under the weight of imports from low-cost countries.
Employment has fallen by about 25 per cent to 400,000 in the past decade.
BATC will advise employers on industrial relations, central pay bargaining
and marketing as well as lobbying.
The chairman is Mr James McAdam, who retired as deputy chairman and chief
executive of Coats Viyella last year.
BATC's creation is the culmination of a decade's work in reconciling
differences between such diverse groups as the British Throwster's
Association, whose 30-odd members help to process silk, and Coats Viyella,
Europe's biggest textiles manufacturer.
Twelve industry bodies whose roots can be traced back to the Industrial
Revolution are members of the BATC: the British Lace Federation; the British
Narrow Fabrics Association; the British Throwsters' Association; the Central
Council of the Irish Linen Industry; the Confederation of British Wool
Textiles; the Council of British Cotton Textiles; the Scottish Textile
Association; the Silk Association of Great Britain, the Textile Finishers
Association; the British Clothing Industry Association; the British Knitting
and Clothing Export Council and the Knitting Industries Federation.
Three companies become members in their own right: Coats Viyella, Courtaulds
Textiles and ICI Fibres.
The engineering body's 30 founding companies, forming the UK Industrial
Group, represent a variety of manufacturers from all over the country. The
group is launching a recruitment drive to increase the membership to 1,000
companies by the end of next year.
The group is to seek a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary. It is demanding the creation of a national economic
policy to foster closer co-operation between government, industry and the
City.
Mr David Turnbull, director-general of the new pressure group, said that in
the 1980s 'Mrs Thatcher saw off the unions but then left industry to sort it
out in a free-for-all which was fatal'.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Orimulsion fuel fails environment test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES to introduce the controversial fuel orimulsion into Britain received a
setback yesterday when UK pollution inspectors indicated to National Power
that they would not approve it without further environmental measures.
National Power has been seeking permission to burn the fuel at its power
stations at Padiham, Lancs, and Pembroke. The company has asked the
inspectors for more time to reformulate its application.
'We have had constructive discussions with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
Pollution, and there are quite a few issues outstanding to be considered,'
the company said last night. National Power hopes to burn 3m-4m tonnes of
the fuel a year.
Orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel imported from Venezuela, has been denounced
by environmentalists as 'the filthy fuel'. The power generation industry
accepts that it contains more sulphur than most oil or coal, but argues that
its overall emissions are less harmful. It is cheaper than domestically
produced coal and competes with imported coal.
PowerGen, the smaller of the two power generators, has been burning
orimulsion for several years on an experimental basis without environmental
controls at two stations in Kent and Cheshire. The fuel acquired some
notoriety last year after an accident at the Kent plant left nearby cars
corroded.
PowerGen burns about 1.5m tonnes a year under permission granted under
earlier pollution control regulations. The company is having to reapply
under the new regulations.
The HMIP did not detail the extra environmental measures it may ask National
Power to take before it will grant permission, but they are expected to
include flue gas desulphurisation equipment.
The stand taken by HMIP was welcomed by the environmental lobby last night.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said: 'For the first time
ever, the government (has) accepted in principle that orimulsion burning
causes damage and that steps must be taken to limit its effect.'

FT  01 OCT 92 / Warning over electricity coal deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGIONAL electricity companies complained yesterday that they were being
pressured to take extra electricity to help make the new contracts between
the generators and British Coal succeed.
Yorkshire Electricity, one of the companies taking a tough stand in the
negotiations between the generators and the distribution companies, said:
'We are determined to protect the interests of our shareholders and
customers. Negotiations are complex and continuing.'
It was willing to take its full share of the new electricity on offer, based
on its share of the market, but it would not buy additional electricity if
other companies were unable to take up their full amounts.
Several of the 12 regional companies in England and Wales have contracted to
buy electricity from independent power producers or Nuclear Electric,
although the government is trying to get some of these contracts cancelled.
The regional companies are also refusing to take the risk that Professor
Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, may disapprove of the new
contracts. They are insisting on prior approval by Prof Littlechild or an
opt-out clause.
Because they have similar concerns, the regional companies have appointed
central negotiators to speed up the talks. The team is headed by Mr Jim
Keohane, who is in charge of power purchasing at East Midlands Electricity.
The companies intend to reassure the competition authorities the
arrangements are not intended to be anti-competitive.
The contracts will cover electricity generated by the new five-year
contracts agreed between the power generators and British Coal.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Move on PSA sell-off expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of the Property Services Agency's projects division, one of
Britain's biggest construction organisations, is expected to be announced
today by the government.
Tarmac, the country's largest construction and building materials group, is
favourite to take over the division, which designs and constructs buildings
for government and other public-sector bodies.
Many of the division's 2,000 employees are expected to be made redundant.
Construction groups traditionally sub-contract most building work. The
purchaser will also want to merge management teams and make other cost
savings by rationalising the businesses.
The need for any purchaser to fund redundancies and provide guarantees for
work previously completed or undertaken means that the government is
unlikely to raise any cash from the sale.
There have even been suggestions that the government may have to make a cash
payment to the purchaser.
The division, which last year had a turnover of Pounds 190m, has wide
experience of building offices, courts, prisons, laboratories and civil and
military airports.
Its experience of public-sector building requirements and strong links with
government departments has meant that it has continued to win a large share
of public-sector work even though most contracts are now subject to
competitive tender.
About 60 companies originally expressed interest in acquiring the division.

FT  01 OCT 92 / MMC to probe animal waste trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday asked the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to carry out an investigation into the
animal waste market.
The references were prompted by a number of small acquisitions in recent
years by Prosper de Mulder (PDM), Britain's largest offal rendering company.
PDM's proposed acquisition of Nortech Foods, an animal fat processor, was
cleared yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Sir
Bryan concluded that the effect of the acquisition on competition was so
small that it should not be referred to the MMC.
However, he expressed concern about the cumulative effect on competition in
the animal waste products market of the earlier acquisitions.
Sir Bryan is concerned that the increasing domination of the industry by two
companies - PDM in England and Wales and William Forrest and Son in Scotland
 -may be incompatible with effective competition.
The market was scrutinised by the MMC in March last year after the
acquisition by PDM of the rendering interests of Croda International, its
main competitor in southern England. The acquisition was approved in August.
PDM has been required since an MMC investigation in 1985 to notify the
government of any animal wastes acquisitions. Yesterday PDM appeared
resigned to a further investigation, but said it was unsure what the probe
could add to what was already known.
The MMC has been asked to report in nine months.

FT  01 OCT 92 / ITN shares 'could be worth nothing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of Independent Television News shares could be nil, the chief
executive of the ITV Association said yesterday.
Mr Andrew Quinn's comment comes as the news organisation faces a growing
financial crisis because of a failure to let accommodation at its new
central London headquarters. The deficit on the property lease on the ITN
build-ing in Gray's Inn Road is expected to reach Pounds 25m over the next
five years.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, ITN has to dispose of a majority of its
shares to companies that are not ITV broadcasters by the end of 1994.
'I would venture to suggest that those shares are not disposable,' Mr Quinn
said, speaking after a briefing on ITV's future strategy. He did not know
anywhere in the world where news supply was a profit-making business, as ITN
is supposed to become. 'The legislation is just misconceived,' Mr Quinn
said.
The government was warned of the difficulties of turning ITN into a profit
centre but it went ahead with the stipulation that a majority of the shares
had to be sold.
It is not clear who will now pay for the deficit on ITN's headquarters.
On Tuesday, ITN announced 112 redundancies as part of 'a reorganisation of
the company structure to equip it to become an independent, profit-making
business'.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Six-month pay freeze at Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the UK carmaking subsidiary of British Aerospace, is imposing a
six-month pay freeze on its 34,000-strong workforce, including directors and
senior managers.
Mr John Towers, group managing director, said the freeze was necessary to
'help protect the company from the worst consequences of the recession'.
The announcement came as other companies announced more job losses. These
are on top of more than 4,500 announced on Tuesday.
IBM said the UK share of its worldwide job reduction programme would be 600
jobs from its 26 sites, including its Portsmouth headquarters and
manufacturing plants at Havant, Hampshire; and Greenock, Renfrewshire.
Boulton and Paul, one of Britain's largest joinery companies, said it would
close 18 sales centres with the loss of 387 jobs at sites including its
Norwich headquarters and its sites at Maldon, Essex; Lowestoft, Suffolk; and
Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.
Sales centres would also be closed.
Research Machines, the computer manufacturer, is to cut 120 jobs at Didcot,
Oxfordshire, and Oxford. Other job losses include 50 at Yardley Lentheric,
the perfume and soap company, at Basildon, Essex; and 90 by Eastern
Electricity in its contracting division.
Sunblest Bakeries is to shut down half its bread production in Bradford,
West Yorkshire, with the loss of 65 jobs.
However, CFM Northern Ireland, the computing services company 75 per cent
owned by ICL, is to create 150 jobs in Ulster in a Pounds 7.5m investment
backed by the Industrial Development Board.
Rover's pay freeze comes a week after it announced a Pounds 31m operating
loss for the first six months of the year and follows moves last week by
Ford and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to cut 2,500 jobs as the recession continues
to take a heavy toll on the British motor industry.
Mr Tony Woodley, national officer of the Transport and General Workers'
Union and trade union chairman of the Rover joint negotiating committee,
said Rover workers had only recently accepted sweeping changes in working
practices, which had been agreed 'outside the normal pay and bargaining
round, with no extra cash being paid. To further penalise a workforce by a
pay pause, which in any other words is a pay cut, is not acceptable.'
Mr Towers said Rover's costs were still too high. The freeze was 'not
negotiable'. Rover was upholding the commitment to no compulsory
redundancies it made as part of its 'new deal' reforms in working practices.
The trade unions had been due to submit a pay claim next week. Rover intends
to press ahead with the talks, but any increase agreed will not be
implemented until May 1.

FT  01 OCT 92 / First ITV network director confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV CONFIRMED last night that Mr Marcus Plantin, director of programmes at
London Weekend Television, is to be ITV's first network director.
The senior appointment in the creation of a centralised national ITV network
means that Mr Plantin will be responsible for commissioning and scheduling
programmes worth more than Pounds 500m a year.
Mr Plantin, 46, has a background in popular programmes - The Two Ronnies and
The Generation Game at the BBC and Blind Date at LWT - and has been the
favourite for some time to work with Mr Andrew Quinn, the chief executive of
the ITV Association. He will take up the post in the near future.
A significant barrier to the deal was the London ITV company's share option
scheme, with which the top layer of management was tied to the company with
golden handcuffs before last year's tenders for new ITV licences. If LWT's
share price passes a set threshold by the end of next year, a number of
executives will become millionaires.
It is believed that Mr Plantin would have been included in that pay-out, but
he is being bought out of the share option deal for an undisclosed
proportion of what he might have received. The buy-out is being funded 50
per cent by the ITV companies and 50 per cent by LWT.
'I would not have accepted the job unless it was a satisfactory deal,' Mr
Plantin said, but declined to say how long his contract will run. That
suggests that he has driven a hard bargain over the length of contract.
'Clearly to deliver the goods for ITV you will need to have more than two
years,' Mr Plantin said. He said his new job was about 'buying the best
programmes, the best ideas and overseeing that they are scheduled in the
right place to ensure they do the job for ITV.'
The appointment was announced just before a presentation to more than 1,000
representatives from advertising agencies and advertisers on the future
strategy of ITV.
They were told that ITV intended to improve its 41 per cent share of viewing
in four-channel homes while raising its proportion of young, upmarket
viewers. ITV's audience profile is still downmarket.
Mr Quinn also disclosed that 54 per cent of new programmes being
commissioned for next year had gone to independent producers, a process that
will accelerate the casualisation of the commercial television industry.

PowerGen announced that it would close 1,200MW of uneconomic plant next
March with the loss of 120 jobs, affecting two coal-fired plants at Castle
Donington and Drakelow in the Midlands, and two gas-oil stations at Hayes,
Middlesex, and Leicester.
National Power said it would close 1,530MW of generating plant at eight
sites in England and Wales because of surplus capacity. Agecroft station in
Swinton, Manchester, faces complete closure with the loss of 95 jobs.

THE government is considering the partial privatisation of the health and
safety inspectorates, according to an internal Health and Safety Executive
document.
The HSE confirmed yesterday that the government had asked advisers to test
the suitability of contracting out HSE regulatory functions.
A programme of market testing in the HSE's internal legal services,
graphics, press, publications and information departments began this year.
Consultants are evaluating cost-effectiveness and the quality of provision.
The new areas to be examined include the seven inspectorates, one of which
is responsible for enforcing safety law at nuclear installations. Together
they are responsible for inspecting hundreds of thousands of workplaces.
Mr John Barrell of the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, whose
journal Health and Safety Practitioner made the document public, said he did
not think private companies would have the expertise to carry out HSE
inspection and regulation functions.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Success claimed on lead emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEAD emissions from road transport have fallen by more than two thirds over
the past 10 years, according to figures published by the Department of
Transport yesterday.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, claimed the statistics as a triumph
for government policy on road transport and the environment.
'This is excellent news, and shows what can be done through a combination of
fiscal pricing measures and better engine design to improve the
environment,' he said.
'The introduction of catalytic converters on cars is reducing emissions
still further - particularly carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and
hydrocarbons.'
The figures, contained in the government's annual compendium of transport
statistics, show lead emissions from road vehicles sliding from 6,700 tonnes
in 1981 to 2,200 tonnes in 1990.
One factor was an EC directive sharply lowering the permitted level of lead
in petrol in December 1985. Another was the introduction of unleaded petrol
in 1986, followed by preferential fiscal measures to encourage its use.
On a less encouraging note, carbon monoxide emissions are shown to have
risen from 4.2m tonnes to 6m tonnes between 1981 and 1990, an increase of 42
per cent.
The compendium also shows that motor traffic increased by 49 per cent
between 1981 and 1990, with car traffic rising by 53 per cent and light van
traffic by 59 per cent. Motorcycle traffic fell by 39 per cent.

FT  01 OCT 92 / 'Green' audit to stress tax curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH emphasis on using market forces to bring about environmental change
will be a central theme in the launch today of the government's annual
checklist for progress on environmental issues.
On the second anniversary of the white paper This Common Inheritance, Mr
Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will highlight the government's
plans to make more use of taxes and permits as well as statutory 'green'
regulation.
Last year's green audit, produced by his predecessor Mr Michael Heseltine,
startled environmental groups by its frankness in highlighting a long list
of failures by many government departments to advance green projects.
This year two of the market mechanisms closest to realisation are the plans
to charge for water pollution and proposals to allow companies to trade
permits for emissions.
The permits, part of a wider scheme to reduce acid rain, are intended to
give companies more flexibility in the timing of investment in new equipment
needed to meet rising environmental standards, while maintaining the
country's overall pollution targets.
However, Mr Howard may find some of last year's criticisms returning -
notably that the government is still failing to link its environmental and
transport policies and that, in spite of promises to curb greenhouse gas
emissions, the mechanisms remain unclear.
It is likely that today's emphasis on market mechanisms will generate a
white paper on environmental economic instruments next spring.

decision Mr Perot has promised to announce by this evening. 'He could give
the election to Bush if those who want change are equally divided,' Mr
Clinton said in a television interview yesterday.
The Bush camp, however, appeared to view Mr Perot's entry more calmly. The
president's re-election bid has made so little inroad into Mr Clinton's lead
that his advisers appear to welcome anything that could shake up the race.
A Perot candidacy could do that, although pollsters are uncertain how it
would affect the outcome of the November 3 election.
Mr Perot could hurt either candidate, taking votes from Mr Bush in Texas and
Florida, and from Mr Clinton in the Midwest and perhaps California, or
damage both equally.
However, the unflattering press coverage Mr Perot experienced before
suspending his campaign in July has been already resumed. Most newspapers
yesterday reported critically on the salaries Mr Perot has paid to his
so-called volunteers, or political supporters, as well as on the
disgruntlement of voters who had telephoned his headquarters to urge him not
to run, only to find that their call was automatically recorded as an
expression of support.
Even without a Perot re-entry, Mr Bush has sought to shake up the campaign
with a change of heart on the issue of televised debates.
Mr Bush's proposal on Tuesday to hold four presidential debates, including
Mr Perot if he should declare his candidacy, has been coolly received by the
Clinton campaign.
But, while its details can be criticised (three of the proposed dates would
clash with big baseball matches), the initiative has doused the Clinton
supporters dressed in chicken costumes who have taunted the president at
every campaign stop for his refusal to debate.
Most pollsters now believe Mr Perot could win almost as many votes as
earlier independent candidates such as Governor George Wallace, who received
13.5 per cent of the vote in 1968, or Robert LaFollette, the Wisconsin
populist who scored 16.6 per cent in 1924. Few expect him to match Theodore
Roosevelt, who beat the Republican candidate out of second place in 1912
with 27.4 per cent of the vote.

FT  01 OCT 92 / OECD sees sharp growth for Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO should enjoy single-digit annual inflation and growth of 5 to 6 per
cent through the mid-1990s, although a widening current account deficit
presents risks to the economy, according to a survey from the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development.
A survey published today, the first by the Paris-based organisation of
industrialised nations for a non-member country outside eastern Europe, says
that the deficit - expected to widen to Dollars 16.2bn this year - 'could
once again become difficult to finance'.
At 5 per cent of GDP, the deficit exceeds that recorded at the onset of the
debt crisis in 1982, although, unlike then, it is not a result of government
borrowing.
However, financing a deficit of such magnitude would imply a growth in the
country's foreign liabilities 'in excess of anything observed historically',
the report says.
So far, the deficit appears not to stem from a lack of competitiveness of
Mexican exporters, but reflects rising domestic investment, faster growth in
Mexico over that of its trading partners, and a drop in national savings.
The OECD said its analysis underlines the importance of policies to
encourage savings. Unless savings recover, investment might have to be
scaled back, jeopardising the recovery programme.
Mexican growth this year will be slower than expected - the 1992 projection
has just been revised downward from 4 to 3-3.5 per cent. This, the survey
says, is a result of the slow recovery in the US and caution by investors
awaiting the conclusion of the treaty on the North American Free Trade
Agreement with the US and Canada.
This meant that trade and current account deficits were running higher than
expected. Some weakening of confidence had also meant that interest rates
have had to increase to generate the requisite capital inflows.
However, growth should accelerate, to 4.9 per cent, next year. It should
then climb towards 6 per cent in 1996, in excess of population expansion,
which is expected to slow from the current 1.9 per cent a year. Meanwhile,
inflation, which should average 14.5 per cent this year (ending the year at
9.7 per cent), should decline to an average 8 per cent next year and to 7
per cent in 1994.
The survey suggested structural improvements were especially needed in
agriculture and education, but said it was too early to say whether recent
reforms by the government to these ends will be effectively implemented and
have the desired effects.
Environmental protection was another area where performance needed to
improve: in particular, enforcement of environmental laws needed to be
better.
The risks to a generally optimistic assessment would come if private saving
continued to decline, hitting investment, or if further appreciation of the
real exchange rate started to hurt Mexican competitiveness.
The current account deficit would be further hit if the Nafta were not
ratified and the US economic recovery were further delayed or weak. On the
other hand, the government's tight fiscal policy should give some cushion
against such adverse shocks, the report concludes.
The survey is a reflection of increased co-operation between Mexico and the
OECD. The Mexican government hopes this will result in its membership of the
organisation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, expects growth for the whole of
this year to be similar to that in the first half - about 2.8 per cent and
so even lower than yesterday's latest OECD forecast, itself revised
downwards. He anticipated an increase in growth in the first quarter of next
year, but emphasised that inflation would have to fall to single figures
before growth of 4 or 5 per cent could be achieved, Damien Fraser writes in
Mexico City.
Mr Aspe also appeared to rule out any additional devaluation of the peso. As
long as the current tight monetary and fiscal policy was maintained, the
peso's 2.5 per cent annual slide against the dollar could continue without
problems, he said. The current account deficit - expected to top 6 per cent
of GDP this year - did not represent a risk to the economy, because it was
generated by private-sector investment, Mr Aspe argued.

FT  01 OCT 92 / All eyes on gap left by Moreira: Prospects for Brazil's
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT yesterday, Mr Itamar Franco, Brazil's acting president, received
a procession of state governors and leaders from most of the country's 17
parties in Congress, all wanting a say in policy and the appointment of
ministers.
The gap everyone is watching is that left by Mr Marclio Marques Moreira,
newly resigned as economy minister. The current economy super-ministry is
expected to be split into at least two parts, with a new ministry for
industry and commerce. This would be warmly received by the powerful Sao
Paulo business community, which feels not enough attention has been paid to
this area. The remainder may be further divided into finance and planning
ministries.
The new minister is expected to come from the south, where Brazil's wealth
is concentrated, quite possibly from Sao Paulo, and may be a businessman
rather than a politician.
Even so, Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the new foreign minister, said
last night that the new economy minister would have to be someone who could
'pedal his bicycle through Congress', meaning there was a need for a person
with good connections to a body in the ascendant now that it has asserted
itself against the executive.
The name of the sixth person to try running the economy in six years will
give a clue to how Mr Franco intends to rescue Brazil from three years of
recession, rising unemployment, an unmanageable budget, and monthly
inflation of more than 23 per cent.
Names being mooted include Mr Jose Serra, a leading Sao Paulo economist from
the social democratic PSDB and an advocate of an independent central bank.
Another possibility is Mr Jorge Gerdau, head of the largest private steel
group in South America.
Mr Franco has had little time to formulate his ideas. He has no party and no
programme, but yesterday some things were becoming clear. Mr Pedro Simon, a
senator and leading aide to Mr Franco, ruled out a widely rumoured economic
shock plan.
Instead, the new government is expected to take advantage of its
wide-ranging coalition of support to try to implement a wage and price
policy through a series of sector-wide pacts involving federal and state
governments, business and unions, and to push through Congress an emergency
tax reform.
Through this, Mr Franco hopes to win some leeway to reduce interest rates
from about 33 per cent a month, which are crippling industry and bringing
investment to a standstill, and to try to resuscitate the government budget.
This is in a parlous state, particularly after the inducements handed out by
Mr Collor's lieutenants in recent weeks to try to swing Congress members'
impeachment vote the president's way.
The planned fiscal reform, expected to be announced in the next few days, is
likely to focus on simplification of the complex tax system, introduce a
stop-gap tax on financial transactions, and crack down on tax evaders. More
controversial points, such as the revenue split for the federal government
and the states, will probably be left for next year.
Under Mr Collor, the Brazilian economy has been painfully abandoning the
import substitution model, starting to open itself to the world and to cut
red tape. In his two and a half years in office, Mr Collor made astonishing
progress, creating a consensus in society behind previously heretical ideas
such as privatisation, competition and the inflow of foreign products.
Mr Franco's aides insist that the modernisation programme will continue, if
with modifications. But yesterday, lobbyists from FIESP, the powerful Sao
Paulo business federation, were in action, hoping for a slowdown on the
tariff reduction timetable and for suspension of the next round of cuts, due
today.
Mr Orestes Quercia, leader of the PMDB, Brazil's largest party, says: 'There
is no reason for preoccupation over the modernisation programme. On the
contrary, it will run much more smoothly as we will have far more competence
to implement it.'
Differences could come in the privatisation programme, where there is strong
pressure to abandon the system under which companies are sold in exchange
for domestic debt, known as 'rotten money', in favour of a short-term debt
or a cash-only system.
Mr Eduardo Modiano, Mr Collor's head of privatisation, argues that there is
not enough cash available in the market and that using privatisation
proceeds to fund current expenditure would deter people from implementing
fiscal reform: 'It would be like selling your car to go to Disneyland for a
month, having a fine time, and then returning to find that your outgoings
are still more than your salary.'
Mr Franco has given strong indications that he will pay more attention to
social problems and improving Brazil's appalling income distribution gap -
the greatest in the world, according to the World Bank - which resulted from
the country's post-war economic development model.
One of Mr Franco's most urgent problems will be to renegotiate with the
International Monetary Fund targets of an agreement signed in January.
Although Brazil has persistently failed to meet them, and thus drawn down
only the initial tranche, the IMF has kept the agreement on hold.

FT  01 OCT 92 / High office for man who aimed low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENEFICIARY of a political jinx, which seems to destine most of Brazil's
civilian presidents not to complete their mandates, never aimed for high
office. Mr Itamar Franco, the new acting president, almost quit politics
after his first term as mayor of his home town of Juiz de Fora, in Minas
Gerais state in the 1970s, writes Christina Lamb.
By contrast, President Fernando Collor, who now steps down, always felt
destined for great things. On becoming head of the football association of
his home state of Alagoas when he was only 19, he told friends he was headed
for the presidency of the republic. It was an aim he never abandoned, even
during his years as a playboy in Rio de Janeiro, and he achieved it in March
1990 at the age of 40.
Mr Franco is as introverted and home-loving as Mr Collor was adventurous and
dynamic. The new man's time in office is expected to be a welcome relief
from the drama of the Collor years, which the impeachment vote on Tuesday
night spectacularly interrupted.
Nobody expects Mr Franco, 62, to enter the history books as a great leader,
but few Brazilians are looking for that. The overwhelming hope is for a
stable government which will calmly carry out its functions without the
bouts of hysteria and depression which characterised the Collor
administration. 'An Itamar government will mean a much smoother ride,' says
Mr Alexandre de Barros, a political consultant. 'With Collor, we were in the
hands of a nutter, where anything could happen.'
His cabinet is expected to be a grey, more managerial, affair than Mr
Collor's assortment of characters. Those included a fervent
environmentalist, a union leader, and a woman economy minister who fell in
love with the justice minister, a married man, passing him billets doux in
cabinet meetings and then authorising a biography about it all.
Mr Franco has no party political allegiance, having quit Mr Collor's party
this year after a row. A staunch opponent of the military regime that ended
in 1985, he is most closely identified with the Democratic Movement Party,
the country's largest party.
Mr Maurcio Correia Lima, widely expected to be justice minister, says: 'The
Itamar government needs to be one of transition, above party fights. It
should not get involved in polemics, such as (those on) the referendum next
April on the political system, or in backing candidates in the 1994
elections.'

<TEXT>
POLICE sealed off Argentina's Congress in central Buenos Aires yesterday as
pensioners held a demonstration as part of a year-long campaign for a rise
in pensions.
They protest outside Congress every Wednesday. Last week, they had stormed a
police barrier. This led to scuffles which the government claims were
started by seven 'extremist' provocateurs.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, has refused all increases not funded
by increased taxes or contributions. The government's hard line has only
increased the pensioners' desperation.
Argentina has about 4m pensioners whose benefits consume 7 per cent of gross
domestic product. The government has refused to increase the minimum pension
of the equivalent of Dollars 150 a month because it says the public pension
fund is bankrupt. It is working on a pensions reform, replacing state
benefits with private ones.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Bipartisan drive to strengthen US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENATORS Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici yesterday cast aside party loyalties to
make a bipartisan appeal for a long-term programme of reforms to strengthen
the US economy and reduce the budget deficit.
At a news conference, they urged a radical re-shaping of the tax system,
involving the replacement of personal income taxes by consumption taxes, as
part of a strategy to increase national savings and balance the federal
budget by 2002. They also urged deep cuts in planned federal spending so as
to help pay for increased investments in education, training and
commercially relevant research and development.
Mr Nunn, a Democrat from Georgia, and Mr Dominici, a Republican from New
Mexico, were releasing the first report of the Strengthening of America
Commission, a bipartisan group of 60 prominent Americans assembled by Center
for Strategic and Internantional Studies, a Washington think-tank.
It specialises in foreign policy but, since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, has recognised that 'some of America's biggest trouble spots are not
abroad but at home.' It argues that deep-seated social and economic problems
at home can be solved only if the US develops a bipartisan consensus on
policies, similar to that forged on national security in previous decades.
The report's most radical proposal is that personal income taxes be
abolished and replaced by a progressive consumption-based tax. It is not
urging a value-added tax, but a reform of existing personal taxes. Taxpayers
would take annual income, add net borrowing, gifts and bequests, and
subtract all savings, such as net investments and increases in bank
deposits.
The advantage of such a tax is that it would remove the current fiscal bias
against saving while letting rich individuals be taxed at higher rates than
the poor, thus retaining progressivity. The commission believes the new tax
would stimulate savings and investment.
It would be phased in as part of a strategy to balance the federal budget
within a decade. The commission advocates an 8 per cent cut in planned
federal spending, saving Dollars 1,500bn over the next decade. The
consumption tax would also raise an additional Dollars 376bn - equivalent to
a 3 per increase in revenues.
However, spending cuts would have to be legally guaranteed before taxes
could be raised, and tax increases would be limited to no more than Dollars
1 for every Dollars 2.75 of spending reductions.
Much of the spending reduction would be achieved by capping the growth of
entitlement programmes such as Medicare, the health scheme for the elderly.
The commission also argues strongly for increased investment in areas
critical for future economic competitiveness. Sales of new homes fell 6.1
per cent in August, providing further evidence of US economic weakness. The
drop was the biggest since March and compared with analysts' forecasts of a
gain of about 2 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil will not resign, his spokesman said
yesterday, despite his crushing defeat in a Congressional vote that opens
the way to an impeachment trial in the Senate.
This would leave Brazil with an acting president and a suspended president
until the conclusion of Mr Collor's trial within the next six months. He is
accused of benefiting from extensive corruption while in office.
In Braslia yesterday, there was discussion over how to transfer power to
Vice-President Itamar Franco after the vote in the House of Representatives
on Tuesday night. He is likely to be declared acting president today.
Mr Franco is preparing an emergency programme, to be announced when he is
confirmed in office. His spokesman said his main concern was a return to
economic growth after three years of recession. The programme would include
tax reform and health and education changes.
Mr Collor's cabinet, incuding economy minister Mr Marclio Marques Moreira,
resigned yesterday, although ministers will stay as caretakers until their
successors are named. The only appointment in view so far is that of Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso as foreign minister.
The festivity and excitement which greeted the the impeachment vote has
continued across the country. Street parties went on until dawn and statues
were painted in the national colours of green and yellow to celebrate the
441:38 landslide vote forimpeachment. Demonstrator after demonstrator
proclaimed: 'We're proud to be Brazilians'.
The result of the vote and the formal request for Mr Collor's suspension
from office was handed in the morning by Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, House chairman,
to Mr Mauro Benevides, Senate chairman. The former said the request
contained 'a profound lesson for the whole nation and a clear demonstration
of the strength of our institutions .. We have given the world a lesson in
democracy'.
Mr Collor spent his last day in the presidential palace contemplating the
apparent demise of a political career that seemed promising when he assumed
office in March 1990 as the country's first directly elected president for
30 years, and its youngest.
Aides yesterday described his mood as 'serene', but admitted that he had
reacted furiously to the result of the vote, berating numerous Congressmen
for having 'betrayed' him, and toying with the idea of making an angry
address to the nation.
Mr Etewaldo Dias, his spokesman, said yesterday Mr Collor would collaborate
with the transfer of power, wanting this 'to be civilised and to cause the
minimum possible social agitation'. Mr Dias repeated that there was no
possibility of Mr Collor resigning, but said that he would agree to stand
trial in the Senate.

FT  01 OCT 92 / World Trade News: West looks to fly-away growth of east Asia
 -A region fast establishing itself as the hub of international airline
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE couples often hold their wedding receptions in the air conditioned
splendour of the city state's Changi airport, then hop on an aircraft. These
days there are plenty of honeymoon destinations to choose from.
There are newly opened routes to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, to
Phnom Penh in Cambodia, to numerous destinations in China or in the
Indonesian archipelago. Further afield, new routes have been opened to North
America and Europe.
It is the same story in virtually every city in east Asia. While recession
has kept the airline business in North America and Europe down in the
clouds, in east Asia it is experiencing fly-away growth.
The region's rapidly growing economies, more tourist traffic and the lifting
of travel restrictions in some countries, notably Taiwan and Korea, have
resulted in more passengers.
Throughout the region airlines are expanding operations or new airline
companies are being formed. And the western aircraft manufacturers are all
scrambling to form joint ventures with Asian partners to position themselves
strongly in what remains the most promising sector of the hard-pressed civil
aviation industry.
British Aerospace has now set its sights on Taiwan to help revive its
flagging fortunes in the regional aircraft business. It hopes its proposed
Dollars 500m joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace to manufacture regional
jets will ensure a continued strong British presence in the fiercely
competitive regional jet market.
Philippine Airlines is newly privatised and has orders and options for 16
new wide-bodies aircraft. Even the smaller carriers such as the reorganised
Vietnam Airlines are enjoying robust growth. Vietnam Airlines says it is
achieving an 80 per cent payload on its recently established flights to and
from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.
A recent report by the International Air Transport Association (Iata)
forecast that airline passenger numbers in the Asia Pacific region will
double over the next six years. By 2000, the region will account for nearly
40 per cent of worldwide passenger traffic, by the year 2010 that figure
will be more than 50 per cent - representing 375m passengers.
In south -east Asia, Iata predicts that passenger traffic will grow by more
than 9 per cent in each of the next three years, compared to an annual
growth of 3.9 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America.
Airport overcrowding and various infrastructure bottlenecks threaten to hold
up expansion. While Tokyo and other Japanese cities face the most serious
airport problems Hong Kong, Bangkok, Seoul and Kuala Lumpur are already
operating at or near full capacity. Iata says only two of the main air
traffic 'hubs' in the region - Taipei and Singapore - have the facilities to
cope with the expected growth.
Mr Karmjit Singh, assistant director for corporate affairs at Singapore
Airlines, says runway space shortages, a lack of sufficient parking at
airports and inadequate terminal facilities are some of the more serious
constraints on growth. 'Airlines, airport authorities and governments have
to get together to deal with these problems,' said Mr Singh.
Airports are either being expanded or built at Tokyo and Osaka in Japan and
at Seoul in Korea. Hong Kong still hopes to open its new airport by 1997 and
Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur also have plans to build new airports.
The trouble is that if Iata growth projections are proved correct many of
these new facilities will be operating at virtually maximum capacity from
the day they open and increasing air cargo is going to add to the problem.
Asia's airlines face other challenges. Maintenance facilities in the region
are already solidly booked. While congestion problems are still not as
serious as in Europe or on routes across the Atlantic, air traffic control
systems in the Asia region need updating and co-ordinating.
Many airlines in the region have been forced to recruit expatriate pilots.
Pilot shortage is particularly acute in Singapore and Hong Kong.
Aircraft manufacturers and leasing companies have been falling over
themselves to cultivate connections in the Asian market. Boeing estimates
that by 2005 the region will need nearly 2,000 new aircraft, almost 50 per
cent of that number the large, long range types.
New airlines such as EVA in Taiwan and Asiana in South Korea have become
important customers for the aerospace and leasing companies.
Most airlines in the region agree that the future lies not so much in
Europe/Asia flights as in trans Pacific connections. Growing trade links
across the Pacific plus a considerable population shift to the western
American seaboard from Asia guarantees passenger growth in the years ahead.
Apart from developing ties with Asian partners in the regional airline
business, the big aerospace companies are also seeking alliances in Asia in
order to develop the airliner of the future - the 600-700 seat super jumbo
capable of flying non stop across the Pacific, from Hong Kong or Singapore
or Bangkok to Los Angeles.
Before too long those couples at Changi should be able to finish their
airport wedding meal and fly direct to their honeymoon in San Francisco.

FT  01 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EC, US push for Gatt deal by mid-month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EC and the US intend to try for a breakthrough on the Uruguay Round
world trade talks early this month, in time for endorsement by European
Community heads of government at the Birmingham summit on October 16, should
the talks prove successful.
European Commission officials in Brussels are approaching the meeting with
the caution born of a series of previously-billed breakthroughs which turned
into impasses, but with genuine belief that a deal could now be done.
'The political will is now there' to get through the farm subsidies maze
which has held up the Round since the Brussels summit collapsed in December
1990, a European Community negotiator said last month.
In Washington, Mr Julius Katz, deputy US trade representative, said the
United States was 'neither optimistic nor pessimistic' about the possibility
of a compromise over agriculture to move the Round ahead.
No meetings were scheduled, although 'conversations' were continuing, he
added.
EC officials disclosed the bilateral talks are provisionally scheduled for
October 10 in Brussels. So far, they say, these would involve Mr Frans
Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, Mrs Carla Hills, US special
trade representative, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr
Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary.
The talks are intended to exploit the so-called 'window of opportunity' for
settling the Round, between the French referendum on Maastricht on September
20 last, and the US elections on November 3.
In spite of EC-US brinkmanship in their worsening oilseed subsidies row, and
a fast-fomenting dispute over steel subsidies which the Commission discussed
yesterday, the main players on the Community side still believe a deal is
possible.
On the row over oilseed subsidies, which a Gatt panel has twice condemned as
against Gatt rules, the US has given the EC until noon today to agree to
binding arbitration.
There are said to be several reasons for renewed political impetus towards a
Uruguay round settlement:
President Bush's wish to improve his fading chances of re-election, through
what could be presented as an economic success for the US, which might allow
him to present his opponent, Governor Bill Clinton, as a protectionist;
The fact that the French referendum on Maastricht revealed France's farmers
to be so alienated from EC farm policy that there is almost nothing
President Francois Mitterrand can recover from this constituency.
The EC's need for a success which could help it get member states' economies
moving again and shift attention from the crisis over the Maastricht Treaty.

TAIWAN yesterday welcomed the decision by Gatt's ruling council to consider

Taiwan would have to agree to trade and other reforms for its bid to be
successful.
Gatt agreed on Tuesday to set up a working party to consider the
application. The group will review Taiwan's trade practices for up to a
year, by which time the island will need a two-thirds majority vote from the
full Gatt council.
Trade areas likely to be reviewed include Taiwan's high tariffs on
agricultural imports, curbs on foreign involvement in securities markets and
preferential government overseas procurement policies, which tend to favour
the US at the expense of Japan. This is designed to cut Taiwan's trade
surplus with the US, which stood at Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 4.8bn) last year,
and contain the island's Dollars 9.7bn trade deficit with Japan.
Officials said privately that joining Gatt would cause short-term harm to
some Taiwanese companies, and is likely to be criticised by the local
farming community. Farmers and forestry workers account for under 15 per
cent of Taiwan's labour force, but are well organised and politically
important.
Taipei is likely to push on with reform, since Gatt membership would boost
its international standing. Because of opposition from China, Taiwan has
full diplomatic relations with only 29 countries. China's application is
being reviewed separately and is likely to be approved before Taiwan's, if
only by minutes.

FT  01 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Hughes of US wins Dollars 258m Arab
satellite contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HUGHES Communications International of the US, part of General Motors,
yesterday won a Dollars 258m (Pounds 150.8m) Arab satellite contract,
officials from the Arabsat consortium said.
The decision is a blow to the two losers, British Aerospace and Aerospatiale
of France. The contract was the only commercial deal left on BAe's
prospective orders book, while Aerospatiale had won the previous Arabsat
contract, still the only satellite built for a non-European buyer by a
European supplier.
The deal consolidates Hughes' position as the dominant supplier in the world
satellite communications market. The company has about two thirds of the
market and an order book worth about Dollars 3bn.
Mr Saad bin Abdul-Aziz al-Bedna, Arabsat's director-general, said Hughes had
won the contract after agreeing to lower its asking price to Dollars 258m
from Dollars 267m and extend the operational life of the satellite to 15
years instead of 10.
The Arabsat board had requested the price cut late on Tuesday, Hughes said.
The two Arabsat-2 satellites will be used for telephony, TV and data
communications. They are likely to be launched in the mid-1990s on the
Ariane rocket made by the French-led European consortium Arianespace.

<TEXT>
DANISH, German and Swedish state railways plan to develop a high-speed rail
system linking Oslo and Stockholm with Copenhagen, and Copenhagen with
Hamburg, Berlin and Cologne.
The intention is to cut travelling time between the capitals by half or
more, enabling the railways to compete better with air transport. Journeys
from Stockholm to Berlin would be 6.5 hours and Oslo-Berlin 8.5 hours. The
plan is estimated to cost DKr40bn-DKr50bn (Pounds 4.1bn-Pounds 5.1bn) over
15 years, including DKr15bn for a rail tunnel linking the south Danish
island of Lolland with Germany under the Fehmern Belt.
Railways concerned are Deutsche Bundesbahn/Deutsche Reichsbahn, SJ, the
Swedish state railway, and DSB, the Danish state railway. Only in the
initial stages, the plan still requires decisions by the respective
governments. Planners predict that with trains travelling at 200-350kph,
passenger and freight traffic will increase dramatically.
Passenger traffic between Hamburg and Copenhagen, when the journey time is
cut from five hours today to two hours, is expected to increase from 1m to
5m passengers a year, while freight traffic will increase from 8m tonnes to
20m-23m tonnes.
The link to Stockholm and Oslo will use the bridge across the Oresund, the
straits separating Copenhagen and Sweden, which the Danish and Swedish
governments are already planning to build, with completion due at the end of
this decade. The plan requires new track between Copenhagen and Hamburg and
a tunnel under the Fehmern Belt. A permanent link across the belt still
needs Danish and German approval.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Islam clouds Pakistan investor hopes: Concerns over the
religious prohibition on interest payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Pakistan's banking system is being decided in the courts, and
the credibility of the government's push to attract foreign investment will
depend on the response.
Within Pakistan, businessmen and politicians are relaxed; they argue that in
practical terms the prohibition of interest payments on loans would have
little impact.
Overseas investors, however, are nervous. There is every chance that it will
turn out to be a non-issue, resolved by introducing a broadly acceptable
alternative system. But while the government pays homage to the
fundamentalist political wing in refusing to confront the realities of
Islamic banking, the cloud of uncertainty will remain.
The debate revolves around the term riba. It is not defined in the Koran and
is variously interpreted as either usury or interest; this interpretation is
of crucial importance, since riba is prohibited under Islamic law.
The dispute has already put back one of the world's largest power projects,
Hab River, by more than six months because the overseas bankers required
special guarantees before they would lend in such uncertain circumstances.
Foreign investors have said that economic 'Islamisation', along with law and
order, are their primary concerns. So far, these appear to have offset the
attractive investment package the government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif
has created for foreign investors.
In November last year, the federal Shariat Court ruled that interest was
'repugnant to the injunctions of Islam'. The court hearing had come soon
after the expiry of a ban by the religious court on the examination of
fiscal law and banking practice.
To a country with a national debt of Dollars 25bn, this is of serious
concern; taken to its logical conclusion, the government's debt arrangements
would be un-Islamic, and the debt therefore should immediately be repaid,
which, of course, it could not be.
It is apparent that the government is satisfied with the status quo. Local
banking already operates under a non-interest arrangement, with
interest-based loans and deposits being replaced with a system of mark-up or
profit-and-loss sharing schemes.
Under the mark-up system, a borrower sells goods to the bank and these are
then sold back at a marked-up price, which is paid back over a fixed period.
Compound interest or mark-up is not permitted, since the key to riba is that
money should not carry any intrinsic time value.
Under the profit-and-loss schemes, depositors participate in the performance
of the banking operation, rather than getting a fixed return. In theory,
they could lose money, but in practice it is possible for depositors to get
a good idea of the likely return on their capital.
The Shariat Court ruling was critical of mark-up and of all forms of
interest-bearing loans, regardless of their justification. Pakistan is a big
issuer of fixed-interest bonds.
The Shariat Court is subordinate to the Supreme Court, which gives scope for
appeal. The finance minister was apparently anxious to do so, but came
across a serious obstacle: the fact that his government had been elected
under an Islamic banner.
In June 1991, the Sharif government passed its own 'Act for the Enforcement
of Shariah' which undertook to 'Islamise' the economy and eliminate riba.
The government did the next best thing, and persuaded the banks to appeal
'independently'.
Then in June, it launched its own appeal. The attorney general argued at the
same time that the prohibition of interest would lead to an economic
collapse.
The business community awaits a date for the appeal to be processed, but it
is assuming this will be postponed for a long time.
Under the government's Shariat Act, a commission was appointed to set out an
alternative economic system which could operate under Islamic principles. No
time was set, and it is likely the government will wait for a recommendation
before tackling the courts, although, in theory, it is not up to the
government when the court hearing is to take place.
In the meantime, the government has undertaken that the Shariat Act will not
affect the validity of any existing financial obligations to foreign
institutions or governments. These will be recognised until the new system
evolves. But there are grey areas. It is not made clear whether the
guarantees apply to any loans that were made after the Shariat Act was made
law.
In addition, lawyers have argued that loan defaulters could defend their
actions against the banks on the basis that the contract was not in
accordance with Islamic law. Even mark-up could be challenged, since the
Shariat Court said this was against the injunctions of Islam.
But the government seems content to allay concerns with the statement that
nothing will change unless a satisfactory alternative is developed. One
local industrialist said he was confident a rational system would evolve,
but only over a long period. 'They will probably just change the names and
the only difference will be that borrowers end up paying more,' he said.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Seoul sees Beijing as 'honest broker'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREAN President Roh Tae-woo left Beijing yesterday claiming that his
four-day state visit would help bring about Korean unification and improve
bilateral economic relations.
The visit - the first by a South Korean leader to China - did not produce
dramatic developments, but South Korean officials expressed satisfaction
that China signalled its willingness to assume the role of 'honest broker'
between the two Koreas.
China is the main ally of North Korea, but it decided to establish
diplomatic relations with Seoul in August. This reflected South Korea's
growing economic power and its possible role as a counterweight to Japanese
influence in the region.
Seoul claims that the forging of relations with Beijing has forced Pyongyang
to adopt a more conciliatory stance in inter-Korean negotiations.
It notes that unexpected progress was reached last month with North Korea on
implementing the reconciliation treaty, although the two remain divided on
the issue of nuclear facilities inspections.
Chinese officials warned Mr Roh that intense international pressure should
not be placed on Pyongyang concerning nuclear inspections.
They suggested that Pyongyang might soon make a concession on the issue.
Mr Roh and other South Korean officials have also recently hinted that North
Korea's suspected programme to build a nuclear weapon may have been
abandoned or suspended.
China favours the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and has refused
to provide nuclear technology to Pyongyang.
The establishment of Sino-South Korean relations was the final step in Mr
Roh's 'Nordpolitik' policy to forge ties with North Korea's closest allies,
which included the former Soviet bloc.
Beijing has been quietly persuading North Korea in recent years to adopt
some of the market measures taken in China. China and South Korea said the
benefits of their closer bilateral economic relations could be extended to
North Korea.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Dawkins confident of recovery: Australian treasurer expects
upturn before next year's election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA will not see dramatic declines in unemployment as its economy
recovers from recession, but growth in employment, when it occurs, will be
sustainable, Mr John Dawkins, Australia's treasurer, said in London
yesterday.
He said the Labor government of Mr Paul Keating, was not making 'heroic'
forecasts of sharp falls in unemployment, now at 10.9 per cent.
The rate is sensitive for the government, which must call an election by
mid-1993 and is struggling to pull the economy out of a long and deep
recession.
Mr Dawkins said unemployment would drop below 10 per cent during 1993, but
he could not say that this would occur before the election.
However, he was confident that the signs of an improvement would be there by
the time the election was called.
The monetary and fiscal stimulus which the government has given to the
economy would not re-ignite inflation, Mr Dawkins said.
Inflation dropped to an annual rate of 1.2 per cent in the quarter to
end-June. The government has sought to boost the economy through repeated
cuts in interest rates and job-creation programmes.
Low inflation was not simply the result of the two-year recession but was
also attributable to low growth in wages and would therefore be sustainable,
Mr Dawkins said.
The budget boost followed a long period of fiscal rectitude and was being
funded by savings.
It was sensible, he said, for the government to provide such a stimulus when
it could afford to do so. Countries such as Britain and the US, because of
their budget problems, could not afford to do it.
On interest rates, Mr Dawkins said that given the recent instability of
international financial markets, further changes in rates could not be
contemplated for the time being but that they would remain under review.
Sustainable, non-inflationary growth would be the answer to Australia's
balance of payments problems - the deficit is currently projected at
ADollars 15bn or 3 3/4 per cent of gross domestic product.
Australia needed to make inroads into the size of its external debt but this
would take time.
Mr Dawkins said a key element of sustainable growth was continued progress
in liberalisation of trade. The Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec)
grouping would be important in this process because it would help to develop
the widest possible constituency for liberalisation, he said.
Australia was instrumental in establishing Apec, which has so far consisted
of a series of meetings but agreed recently to establish a permanent
secretariat.
Mr Dawkins suggested that eventually it could have functions similar to that
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in the
industrialised world, monitoring regional economies.
A key objective, he said, was to maintain US economic involvement in Asia
while it reduces its military presence.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Housing starts lift Japanese gloom

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEBUILDING in Japan, one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy
economy, recorded a 12 per cent increase in housing starts in August against
a year earlier.
It was the third consecutive monthly increase, according to figures
published by the Ministry of Construction.
August's rise was the biggest since March 1988 when the economy was in the
midst of a property boom.
However, overall construction orders placed in August fell 5.8 from the year
before, led by a 38.7 per cent fall in orders from the private sector,
according to the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors.
The growing role of the public sector in the property and construction
markets was underscored by a 56.7 per cent increase in public sector orders.
This was mainly due to the way public sector orders were brought forward
into the first half of the year by a public spending package announced in
March.
The upturn in housing starts may also partly reflect additional public money
being pumped into the housing market through the public sector housing loan
system. However, the upturn in construction activity has not yet fed through
into increased demand for consumer durables.
Construction of privately owned homes rose by 22.3 per cent from the same
month last year, while starts on homes for rent rose by 27 per cent.
Despite these rises the property market remains deeply depressed.
Construction starts on houses and condominiums for sale fell 26.9 per cent
from August last year. It was the 17th consecutive month in which starts on
houses and condominiums for sale fell, the longest run of declines on
record.

<TEXT>
ANGOLA'S National Electoral Commission extended voting in a handful of rural
areas last night to give all registered voters a chance to make their choice
in the war-shattered country's first free elections.
'By midnight we expect everybody who wants to vote will have voted and we
expect the turnout to be at least 90 per cent,' said Mr Onofre dos Santos,
commission chairman. The two-day ballot passed relatively smoothly,
confounding widespread fears of violence and ballot-rigging.
In an isolated incident last night a policeman guarding the house of the
deputy minister of the interior was shot dead. Police said the gunmen were
members of the opposition group Unita who believed the Luanda residence of
Armindo Espirito Santo was being used to plot attacks on Unita leader Mr
Jonas Savimbi.
Earlier observers saw the success so far of the elections as offering hope
for democracy elsewhere in Africa. 'It been a historic two days for the
continent,' said one. 'If Angola can do it, with all the logistical and
political problems, then the rest of Africa can do it too.'
Mr Dos Santos said at least 2.5m people, about 60 per cent of the 4.86m
registered voters, voted on the first day of polling. Logistical problems
which delayed the establishment of about 400 polling stations on Tuesday had
been overcome, he said, and it would be necessary to extend voting till late
last night at only 40 stations of 5,800 across the country.
Counting was under way last night and a result is expected this evening if
an operation to fly electoral officers from remote areas to provincial
centres continues smoothly.
Diplomats and other observers praised Angolans and the election commission.
'There has been a tremendous enthusiasm to vote across the country which
shows that Angolans want the new Angola to work,' said one observer. 'We've
been amazed at the character of Angolans throughout ..the political
awareness, tolerance, responsibility and gravitas about the historic
moment.'
The toughest test comes in the next 24 hours when one of the two main
rivals, the MPLA government or the former rebels Unita, must accept defeat.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDEPENDENT commission of inquiry in South Africa yesterday condemned the
'indiscriminate and prolonged shooting' by Ciskei homeland troops which left
28 African National Congress (ANC) demonstrators dead after last month's
march aimed at toppling the Ciskei government.
Meanwhile the ANC confirmed last night it would return to constitutional
talks following the summit between President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson
Mandela.
The inquiry, headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, also strongly criticised ANC
leaders, saying their actions were irresponsible and deliberately placed the
demonstrators in imminent danger which resulted in death and injury. Mr
Goldstone recommended that the ANC leadership publicly censure those of its
officials who were responsible.
The Ciskei massacre, which also left one Ciskei soldier dead (ballistics
evidence showed he was shot by his own side), provoked a serious political
crisis which was only defused after substantial concessions from the South
African government to the ANC.
Mr Goldstone said in his report that Ciskei's claim that its soldiers were
shot at by the demonstrators was not probable. He added: 'Indiscriminate and
prolonged shooting at innocent demonstrators is morally and legally
indefensible and is deserving of the strongest censure.
'When the crowd in that area turned to flee. . .the continued and prolonged
firing was quite unjustifiable and unlawful,' he said. He recommended that
criminal charges be brought.
The report said the action by a communist party leader, Mr Ronnie Kasrils,
in leading a group of demonstrators through a gap in a fence and toward
soldiers hidden in long grass 'was the immediate cause of what followed'.
The 36-page report will put pressure on President F W de Klerk to ensure
that homeland governments, which Pretoria funds and whose security forces it
largely controls, permit free political activity. The report argues that
reasonable and negotiated mass demonstrations should be tolerated anywhere
in South Africa, including the nominally independent black homelands.

THE UNITED Nations is pulling out of southern Sudan after a UN worker and a
foreign journalist were killed in mysterious circumstances at the weekend,
Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Mr Thomas Edval, co-ordinator of UN Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), said
yesterday relief operations near the town of Juba were closed.
The main faction of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said on Tuesday
a splinter group had murdered a Norwegian journalist whose name it gave only
as Helge and a UN staffer from Burma named Myint Moung, and abducted two aid
workers on Sunday.
Relief workers said starving millions in the region could face imminent
death if the UN shut its operations.
The UN said an international outcry had scuttled a scheme by European
companies to dump 10m tonnes of toxic waste in Somalia. African and western
governments were outraged last month by reports that a Somali claiming to be
a government minister had signed a 20-year dumping deal.
Relief agencies said they were evacuating staff from the Somali port of
Kismayu after constant threats by gunmen trying to loot food meant for the
starving. Aid workers were said to be blockaded in a UN compound by their
own Somali guards because of disputes over money.

THE World Bank has postponed a decision on changes to the controversial
Narmada dam project in India.
The Dollars 3bn dam and associated canal and drainage works, which will
provide irrigation and drinking water to 30m people in western India, have
been under construction since 1987. But after persistent criticism, the
World Bank last year asked for an independent report.
The report, by Mr Bradford Morse, a former administrator of the United
Nations Development Project, backed many of the objections. He was
especially critical of the inadequate measures to resettle people displaced
by the dam's waters.
The World Bank executive board had been due to meet today to discuss the
action plan produced by Bank staff in the wake of the Morse report, but
directors want more time to consider the proposals.
The board is expected to meet again on October 15.
Some directors want to hear Mr Morse's comments on the Bank's revised plan
before committing themselves.
Mr Morse's support for the new plan would help to deflect much of the
criticism that Bank officials still believe they will receive from
environmental groups.

ISRAEL said yesterday a meeting between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, its prime
minister, and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad was essential if peace talks
between the two countries were to be successful.
Although it has so far been rejected by Damascus, Israeli ministers made
clear their insistence on the proposal following a cabinet review of the
latest round of Middle East peace talks which ended in Washington last week.
'This meeting is necessary, essential. Without it we will not be able to
break through the psychological and practical barriers that prevent fast
progress,' said Mr Haim Ramon, health minister.
During the month-long talks, due to resume on October 21, slow but
unspectacular progress was reported in the four sets of bilateral
negotiations between Israel officials and delegations from Syria, Jordan,
Lebanon and the Palestinians.
The cabinet also rejected Syria's insistence that any agreement with Israel
must be linked to agreements with the other Arab parties to achieve a
'comprehensive' settlement.
The Palestinians have voiced concerns that Syria and Israel might achieve a
separate accord, leaving the fate of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
unresolved. But Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, said he had been assured by Mr Assad that Syria would not
alter its commitment to a comprehensive peace accord.

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN army said yesterday it had seized control of the airport in
Dushanbe, capital of war-torn Tajikistan, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Akbarsho Iskandarov, acting president of the central Asian republic, said
in messages to CIS leaders and the United Nations that he was powerless to
stop bloody fighting and asked for help, Interfax news agency said.
'The conflict in the south of Tajikistan is growing. It can have
unpredictable consequences not only for Tajikistan, but also for the
Commonwealth states and, possibly, for the whole world community,' he was
quoted as saying.
He urged CIS leaders to take urgent measures to help the government
normalise the situation.
By one estimate Mr Iskandarov's provisional government, which took over
after communist President Rakhmon Nabiyev was forced to resign at gunpoint
last month, controls only 20 per cent of the state's territory.
Moscow rushed in reinforcements to Tajikistan on Tuesday to protect
ex-Soviet forces besieged in the republic by rival groups struggling for
power. The dispatch of additional troops apparently forced the warring sides
in Tajikistan's Kurgan-Tyube region to lift their blockade of a Russian
regiment.
The armed factions have seized weapons from troops serving in Commonwealth
units, now under Russian control, and have taken servicemen hostage. They
had also imposed an effective blockade of the Russian garrison in
Kurgan-Tyube, 80km south of Dushanbe.
Local officials said hundreds of people were killed or wounded in the region
in weekend clashes between local opponents of Mr Nabiyev and his supporters
from the neighbouring Kulyab area.
Neighbouring states have expressed serious concern that the conflict, which
is forcing Uzbeks and Russians to flee Tajikistan, could spread across its
borders.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Russia begins big industrial sell-off: Privatisation
vouchers distributed to public
</HEADLINE>

THE WORLD'S biggest privatisation, the sale of nearly 70 per cent of
Russia's productive capacity, officially begins today with the first issue
of Rbs10,000 vouchers to the country's 150m men, women and children.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation,
said in an interview yesterday that the privatisation 'is unprecedented in
the history of Russia and perhaps in the history of the world. There has
never been such a campaign to open up our economy, to our people and to
foreigners'.
He hopes that, by the end of the year, 6,500 large companies will have
completed registration as joint stock companies and will have begun offering
their shares in auctions to the public for vouchers and cash.
The companies must all present their plans to the State Committee for
Property, which Mr Chubais heads, by November 1. Auctions are due to begin
from December 1.
Of the more than 40 per cent of companies which have already finished their
privatisation plans, he said, most had chosen options which gave most shares
to the workers and managers.
One option allows the work collectives to buy 51 per cent of the shares on
favourable terms, the other assigns 25 per cent to the collectives free,
with a further 10 per cent to workers and 5 per cent to managers on
favourable terms - in both cases before the remainder of the shares are
offered in public auctions.
Foreigners are free to participate in the auction process with Russians,
with the exception of some enterprises in the defence and energy sectors.
Mr Chubais said that already, foreign companies were assisting the
collectives to buy their shares in return for themselves receiving shares in
the companies.
A campaign is soon to be launched abroad to explain to foreign companies how
best to invest. Within Russia itself, an information blitz is to be
launched, with posters, advertisements in the newspapers and on television
and the start of what Mr Chubais called 'a funny game show' on nation-wide
television based on the purchase of companies.
Though a secondary market in the vouchers has already started before they
are issued, Mr Chubais said that the government opinion polls showed that
only 35 per cent of citizens would immediately sell their shares for cash.

<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, yesterday announced the resignation
of the prime minister, Mr Vitold Fokin, in an effort to appease the
country's increasingly assertive parliament.
A conservative who favoured centralised control over the economy, Mr Fokin
had become the focus of attack on the government's poor economic performance
and its failure to implement long promised market reforms.
In sacrificing his position, Mr Fokin appears to have saved his economic
plan, which calls for reassertion of central economic control and only
gradual privatisation.
Mr Kravchuk left in place the rest of the cabinet. Much will now depend on
the figure chosen to succeed Mr Fokin.
Speculation has focused on Mr Leonid Kuchma, a missile factory director, Mr
Valentin Symonenko, deputy premier, and Mr Ivan Pliushcht, parliament's
chairman.
The resignation has forestalled efforts by some parliamentarians to call a
no confidence vote in the entire cabinet.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Romanians vote in freedom but with little hope
</HEADLINE>

   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROMANIANS have just conducted the freest elections in their country's
turbulent history. But the support given to politicians linked to the recent
communist past highlights one of the difficulties facing this former
dictatorship in its struggle to build a solidly based democracy.
The picture provided by the elections shows a deeply polarised society.
Fault lines run between town and country, between young and old, and most
markedly between the ethnic groups.
The country's substantial Hungarian community and rapidly diminishing German
population have preserved their language and customs after living for
centuries alongside gypsies and the Latin Romanian majority.
President Ion Iliescu, a close aide to the executed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu in the early 1970s, emerged as clear front-runner in Sunday's
presidential vote. By far the most skilled and experienced of Romania's
politicians, he won strong support in rural areas, where half the population
still lives, and in the heavy industrial areas where a 50 per cent collapse
in production from overmanned and obsolescent state companies has increased
unemployment and insecurity.
Sociologists and Mr Iliescu's many political opponents believe his most
tenacious supporters are among the former communist nomenklatura: the
bureaucrats, managers and secret police who were the backbone of the
Ceausescu regime.
It is the tenacity of the nomenklatura's hold on the levers of power and
patronage which has most dismayed the young, the budding private
entrepreneurs, and the liberal intelligentsia of Bucharest and other cities
who backed Mr Emil Constantinescu, presidential candidate of the 18-party
Democratic Convention, a loose coalition of opposition parties.
But many younger Romanians have already voted with their feet. Up to 1m
people, including many of the most skilled and educated, are believed to
have left the country since the fall of the dictatorship. Many more, their
hopes of a decisive break with the old regime in tatters, will now try to
follow.
A senior official in the privatisation agency, himself about to abandon the
public service, explained. 'This was essentially a negative election. Few
voted enthusiastically for any of the candidates, most voted simply against
the others.'
Mr Iliescu, who gained around 48 per cent of the vote in the six-way first
round of voting for the French-style executive presidency, is confident he
will be re-elected for a four-year term in the run-off on October 11 against
Mr Constantinescu, who picked up only 30 per cent.
The party which supports him, the Democratic National Salvation Front, also
emerged as the largest single party in the parliamentary elections, with 28
per cent of the vote, against 27 per cent for the Democratic Convention. But
both the main groupings are far from a parliamentary majority, opening the
way for possibly months of what the Balkans are famous for, horse-trading
and intrigue.
The possible permutations are infinite given the fractious nature of the
Democratic Convention and the relative strength of personal ambition among
all the participants compared to the weakness of party ideology or loyalty.
But with a hungry winter approaching, after a summer of drought and sharply
declining real incomes for most of the population, any new government which
emerges will need the broadest possible political base to survive.

<TEXT>
AN APPEAL by a Russian United Nations officer yesterday averted a march by
Croat refugees on their former homes which would have led to clashes in
Serb-held territory in eastern Croatia.
Despite warnings by the UN and the Croat government of a possible massacre
by Serb forces in Baranja, some 1,000 men and women refugees yesterday
massed in Osijek to return to their homes, abandoned last autumn during the
Serbo-Croat war. Some 77,000 Hungarians and Croats last year fled or were
driven out of their homes in Baranja.
Colonel Viktor Loginov, a UN officer, on a road just south of Osijek, warned
the crowd to stop their march and wait for the UN to allow them to return
home.
'Where will you go? Across mines and into rifle barrels? Everything is
destroyed. There is no water or electricity. How will you live there?' said
the Russian officier speaking in accented Serbo-Croatian.
UN officials had feared the march would have led to violence and could have
jeopardised the UN peace plan which has created four protected areas in
Croatia.
The threatened march appeared to reflect the frustration of Croat refugees
who see the UN as allowing the Serbs to consolidate territorial gains made
during the war. Eastern Croatia was the scene of the some of the worst
destruction and heaviest bloodshed.
Some Croat refugees jeered and hissed at Col Loginov accusing him of being
pro-Serbian and not working to help the refugees. He said: 'I have been here
seven months. We have got rid of the Yugoslav army. They used to shell
Osijek every day. Are they shelling you now? No. I cannot solve this problem
myself. What can you solve with rifles? You can only get your heads blown
off.'
Leaders of Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia were officially reported to have
agreed to end military confrontation on a strategic Adriatic peninsula,
Reuter reports from Geneva.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Iliescu urges parties to bury the hatchet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH, ANTHONY ROBINSON and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Ion Iliescu warned yesterday that Romania faced an economic and
social crisis. He called on the country's divided political parties to form
a broad-based government of 'national reconciliation', write Virginia Marsh
and Anthony Robinson.
He said he was prepared to accept any coalition which found consensus within
the new parliament following inconclusive results from Sunday's general
election.
'This is a grave moment for the country and it is high time we went beyond
political divisions and found a formula for mutual understanding,' said Mr
Iliescu, who looks set for re-election in a presidential run-off on October
11.
With 90 per cent of votes counted following Sunday's poll, the new
parliament appears likely to balance almost equally parties favouring
limited reform and a broad network headed by the Democratic National
Salvation Front (DNSF), against proponents of faster market-oriented
reforms. However, Mr Iliescu, DNSF presidential candidate, said any
government would have to take into account the social costs of reform.
Mr Mugur Isarescu, central bank governor and a key member of the present
government, yesterday vowed to take administrative measures to clear an
estimated Dollars 2.5bn in state enterprise arrears, even if it meant
liquidating unprofitable companies and creating political difficulties.
The US House of Representatives yesterday overwhelmingly rejected a bill,
backed by the Bush administration, to restore Romania's most favoured nation
trading status, writes George Graham.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S financial sector watchdog, the Banking, Insurance, Securities
Commission, was ineffective, lacked the resources it needed to operate
efficiently and was too weak to alert government authorities to signs the
country was on the verge of a banking crisis, according to a government
report published yesterday.
The report also criticises the banks, the central bank and the statistics
bureau, which, it says, could have alerted the government.
It points to several main causes behind the collapse of the banking system
which resulted last autumn in the state becoming the main owner of Norway's
banks.
The banks maintained a low interest rate policy for commercial and
non-commercial loans which was significantly below their own funding costs,
according to the report. Their capital ratios deteriorated markedly, with
subordinated loans increasing steadily as their equity bases eroded.
They were also severely hit by new rules for loan loss reserves implemented
in 1987, a time when the financial sector crisis was already well underway.
The rules forced the banks to account for anticipated, but not yet
materialised, high loan losses and they were therefore forced to book losses
before the losses actually occurred.
The crisis was also precipitated by the effects of a sharp downturn in the
country's economic cycle, a collapse of the real estate market and
deregulation of the banking system.
The level of competition between the banks brought too rapid expansion and
too lax credit judgement.

FT  01 OCT 92 / French budget seeks to stave off pressure against franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday tabled a compromise budget for 1993, seeking
to stave off pressure on the franc, while offering limited tax breaks before
next March's legislative elections.
The budget, agreed by the cabinet yesterday morning, proposes a fractional
real rise in public spending and a smaller deficit than the markets had
expected. Paris plans to lift government spending by 3.4 per cent to
FFr1,367bn (Pounds 156.76bn) next year, as against a stable inflation rate
of 2.8 per cent, making this the third year running in which the state has
held expenditure barely ahead of inflation.
Tax receipts are expected to fall, leading to a steep rise in the budget
deficit. The shortfall is forecast to reach a record FFr165bn, which would
represent 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year, based on
the government's forecast that the economy will grow by 2.6 per cent in
1993, up from the 2.1 per cent forecast for this year.
'It's a good budget, a coherent budget that recognises our priorities,' said
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister.
Next year's deficit would still be just below the 3 per cent GDP target for
budget deficits set by the Maastricht treaty as a criterion for monetary
union.
Economists fear the 1993 deficit could easily turn out larger than the
government expects, on the grounds that the interest rate increase provoked
by the recent currency crisis could make its growth forecast unattainable.
France's budget deficit has overshot in each of the past two years, because
receipts from value added tax and corporate taxation, representing 58 per
cent of the government's income, have been eaten away by the economic
slowdown. The current year's deficit is expected to be well over FFr135bn,
as against the FFr89.6bn on which the 1992 budget was originally based.
The education ministry, by far the biggest spender, is to get a 7.2 per cent
increase in allocations to FFr281bn, which will enable it to take on an
extra 10,000 staff.
Yesterday's tax breaks are worth FFr4.5bn in a full year and include income
tax reductions for parents of school-age children, incentives for buyers of
cars fitted with catalytic converters and confirmation of a small reduction
in corporation tax - from 34 per cent to 33.33 per cent - announced last
spring.
The budget will go to the national assembly for approval in mid-October,
where it will be the subject of a no-confidence vote against the weakened
government. Conservative opposition parties say the budget does not do
enough to stimulate the flagging economy.
The government survived the last censure motion, on farm policy reform in
June, by just three votes. But since then, four Socialists MPS have moved to
the senate, the upper house.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Spending cuts deal in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALL-PARTY agreement was reached early yesterday in Sweden on a crisis
package to reduce public spending next year by SKr20bn (Pounds 2.1bn). The
measures - hammered out in talks on Tuesday night - are designed to calm the
foreign exchange markets and improve the industry's competitiveness.
Sweden's central bank cut its overnight lending rate to the commercial banks
yesterday from 40 per cent to 24 per cent in response to the package.
Initial market reaction was positive with a sharp fall in market interest
rates and a 6.4 per cent jump in the Stockholm bourse.
The main changes involve a 4.3 per cent reduction in employers' social
security contributions from January 1. The loss of revenue will be met by
keeping the main VAT level at 25 per cent and increasing VAT on food and
transport from 18 to 21 per cent.
Two days are to be cut from the current statutory annual five weeks and two
days paid holiday, equivalent to a 0.7 per cent reduction in employer
contributions. Income tax allowances are being reduced from SKr10,000 to SKr
7,500.
The main political parties also agreed to reduce housing subsidies by around
SKr15bn over the next few years. These reforms follow the SKr28bn cuts in
spending and SKr7bn rise in taxes agreed on September 20.
Taken together, the measures will result in a long-term budgetary
reinforcement of SKr70bn, bringing a substantial reduction in Sweden's
structural budget deficit, estimated at 4.8 per cent of gross domestic
product.
The government calculates the changes will cut 4 per cent from industry's
costs next year. Along with an expected low national wage agreement and
productivity improvements, industry should increase its competitiveness by
11 per cent compared with 1990, especially with Germany, its most important
trading partner.
Ministers believe the sharp reduction in employer costs will improve
employment opportunities, increase production and enhance economic
stability. But the government estimates it will add SKr6,000 a year to every
household's living costs.
The latest crisis package was welcomed warmly by Swedish employers.
'It will strengthen industry's competitive power and make it possible to
prevent unemployment rising to catastrophic levels,' said Mr Magnus Lemmel,
head of the industrial employers' federation.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Community close to road tax plan for lorries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday adopted a plan for a mutually agreed
system of road tax discs for EC lorries, regarded as essential for opening
up road haulage markets.
The plan, announced by Mr Karel van Miert, transport commissioner, is likely
to win approval from the Twelve because individual member states like
Germany are otherwise expected to go ahead with national road tax systems
likely to discriminate against outside hauliers.
The proposal follows a European Court of Justice ruling against German plans
to introduce unilaterally a road tax payable by foreign lorries.
A decision is expected before the end of the year on the measure, which will
come into effect in January 1994 and apply only to motorways and lorries
over 12 tonnes.
The object of the tax is to enable member states to recover infrastructure
costs from their road networks, and also to make railway transport more
attractive.
But no less important is the now improved prospect of the 12 agreeing to
road cabotage - allowing hauliers from one member state to pick up and
deliver goods inside another member state.
National restrictions on outside road hauliers mean that up to a fifth of
Community lorries are driving around empty at any given time.
The Commission is suggesting an Ecu929 (Pounds 725) a year minimum tax per
40 tonnes of lorry as a reference, but setting no upper limit.
The discs should be easily obtainable, for variable periods of days, weeks
and months, and imply neither discrimination against outside hauliers nor
border checks, Commission officials said. Where, as in France, a toll system
operates, no change is envisaged.
Officials say governments will be able to reimburse their hauliers for
excessive costs incurred abroad, apparently at French insistence.
The Commission still hopes to double EC spending on research and development
over the next five years in spite of the growing likelihood that member
states will rein back the research budget, writes Andrew Hill.
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, research commissioner, yesterday unveiled plans
for a fourth 'framework' programme of research and technological development
involving spending Ecu14.7bn (Pounds 11.48bn) between 1994 and 1998. The
1990-94 programme is worth Ecu5.7bn.
The funds would be concentrated on certain key areas, including 'generic
technologies' which might benefit all sectors of industry, and 'big science'
 -large research programmes like the human genome project (the genome is the
sum of genetic material in an organism) which require multinational
collaboration.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Lira tumbles on budget nervousness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE lira yesterday suffered its sharpest fall on the foreign exchange
markets since the Italian authorities withdrew it from the European Monetary
System on September 16 and let it float.
The fall was triggered by nervousness in advance of detailed presentation of
the 1993 budget due late yesterday. Dealers said the market was concerned
that Mr Giuliano Amato's government would fail to show sufficient
determination to push tough austerity measures through quickly.
The lira also suffered from rumours that the government was considering
draconian measures, such as freezing bank deposits. These rumours created a
sharp increase in deposit withdrawals from banks and led the prime minister
to issue a formal denial.
This was backed up yesterday by a circular from the Bank of Italy to the
banks.
These rumours and the public's reactions underlined the volatility of
sentiment. The lira yesterday at one stage touched 890 against the D-Mark
before settling at 878. This compared with the lira's relatively stable
838-844 movement in recent days.
On the present parity the lira has declined in value by 13 per cent since
the realignment of September 12, which was then intended to be a maximum of
7 per cent. The latest figure for convertible currency reserves to the end
of August showed a total of L22,891bn (Dollars 18.7bn), emphasising the thin
margin of manoeuvre open to the Bank of Italy when it faced the turbulent
events of this month.
The 1993 budget is aiming to raise L93,000bn in increased taxes and spending
cuts. On the latest projections this would leave a deficit of L150,000bn in
1993, similar to that of the current year. The deficit is equivalent to
almost 11 per cent of GDP.
The government hopes to achieve a primary deficit (without the cost of
interest payments on debt) of L50,000bn. However, interest payments are
being projected at L200,000bn. The main spending cuts are due to come in the
health service, from capping pensions and freezing public sector employment,
and in reduced transfers to local authorities.
Revenue will be enhanced. The government is proposing a special one-off
corporation tax, higher taxes on home ownership and luxury goods, as well as
some L7,000bn from privatisations - half the ambitious target in the
original 1992 budget. Revenue projections are on the basis of an optimistic
1.5 per cent GDP growth and inflation of 4.5 per cent, which takes account
of the lira's September depreciation.
The budget can be discussed for up to three months in parliament. But, given
the need for Italy to regain international credibility, Mr Amato is expected
to press for early approval in a vote of confidence. In recent days he has
threatened to resign if parliament fails to back the measures or attempts to
water them down.
The most controversial aspects of the budget, already outlined on September
17, is a sharp cut in the availability of free medical care and caps on
pensions as part of a wider reform of the generous state pensions scheme.

MR Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, last night advanced his ideas
for introducing a legally binding supplement to the Maastricht treaty to
help overcome the Danish electorate's objections.
Mr Schluter wound up two hours of talks with Mr John Major, the British
prime minister, with both sides voicing satisfaction at the outcome. Mr
Major said the talks had come up with ideas to make acceptable those parts
of the treaty shown to have caused concern.
Denmark is trying to come to a new understanding over the Maastricht
document.
Mr Schluter, accompanied by Mr Offe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister,
earlier said he saw much 'common ground' between Denmark and the rest of the
Community in his request for more openness and less bureaucracy in EC
decision-making.
Denmark is putting forward proposals for additions to the treaty in a white
paper to be published on or around October 12. Denmark will put the
Maastricht treaty, with the additional supplements, to the electorate in a
second referendum next year.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bad blood as a relationship hits its
floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the Bundesbank launched its latest fusillade in the war of words between
Britain and Germany, it was difficult to recall the two countries were until
recently seen as natural allies in European economic and monetary affairs.
Germany was keen to see Britain become a full member of the European
Monetary System throughout the 11 years until October 1990 in which the Tory
government refused to join the European exchange rate mechanism. Bonn and
Frankfurt have long regarded the UK as an ally in spreading free market
ideals in the EC and as a supporter of the single market.
Britain was often seen by senior German officials as a healthy counterweight
to French dirigisme in Europe. Both the UK Treasury and Bundesbank are
Eurosceptics on the question of European Monetary Union.
So, more in sorrow than anger, officials in both countries have watched the
steady rise of bad blood between the two sides since the start of September.
The worsening of relations centres on two men, each of whom feels aggrieved
at how the other has acted.
From the start, Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor, has been forthright
in condemning what he sees as Bundesbank intransigence in refusing to lower
interest rates sufficiently and unhelpfulness in making remarks that helped
to weaken sterling in the run-up to Black Wednesday.
Criticism has also surfaced in Britain of the Bundesbank's supposed failure
to support the pound with the same vigour it showed last week in supporting
the franc.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has been less voluble. But,
while staying controlled and courteous, he has never hesitated to put his
side of a story when he has felt unjustly assailed. Yesterday, he clearly
felt he had to set the record straight, although he appears to have been
surprised at the way the German embassy in London released his remarks.
The row between Mr Schlesinger and the chancellor began with the informal
meeting of EC economics and finance ministers in Bath on September 5. Then,
tempers rose as Mr Lamont repeatedly demanded the Bundesbank cut its
interest rates immediately.
As primus inter pares on the central bank council, Mr Schlesinger could make
no such pledge. After the chancellor had put the same demand four times, Mr
Schlesinger was only held back from walking out when Mr Theo Waigel, German
finance minister, asked Mr Lamont to stop his attacks.
Harsh words are often said in international meetings. But Mr Schlesinger's
discomfiture was followed by public attacks for which he was clearly
unprepared. The Bundesbank president, who in Germany is a revered figure
because of his position and the central bank's reputation as the guardian of
German price stability, found himself vilified by sections of the UK press.
It is understood he was especially upset by articles linking the Bundesbank
with Germany's Nazi past. He resented the way certain journalists phoned him
at home and harassed his wife.
On his recent visit to Washington for the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Mr Schlesinger appeared shaken
by the treatment he had received. He told friends he had never experienced
anything like the attacks on him in the UK tabloids.
But yesterday's statement from Mr Schlesinger was more than letting off
steam. It was meant to clear the air and put on record the Bundesbank's
recollection of events surrounding Black Wednesday.
As such, it contains some important claims going beyond Mr Schlesinger's bid
to clarify what he said in the disputed September 17 interview with
Handelsblatt, the German newspaper, which the UK believes fatally undermined
sterling. The statement asserts the Bundesbank 'treated the pound sterling
and French franc alike in all respects' and the compulsory D-Mark sales in
favour of sterling, which the Bundesbank financed, were 'the largest
compulsory interventions ever undertaken vis-a-vis a partner currency'.
These comments contradict the impression relayed in the UK media last week
that the Bundesbank showed less enthusiasm for the battle to save sterling
than in last week's defence of the franc.
Also new was the disclosure that the Bundesbank bought sterling between the
ERM margins during the operation to keep it in the ERM.
Some parts of the Bundesbank statement portrayed Frankfurt's contribution to
sterling's defence in an especially favourable light, as, for example, when
the German central bank appeared to take credit for the UK Treasury
borrowing of Ecu10bn of foreign currency early in September. It also does
not make clear that the Bundesbank did not support sterling for free and
some of the D-Mark sales appear to have been carried out on behalf of the
Bank of England. This means the German central bank expects the UK will pay
back the credits effectively granted during the support operations in the
ERM.
This accumulation of liabilities by the UK seems to have upset some British
officials. But Bundesbank officials insisted the rules applying in Britain's
case are identical to those that will apply to Italy and France. From its
inception, the EMS has exerted a harsh discipline on weak currency members.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN countries with stable economies and currencies could make up a
joint currency zone that would be the nucleus of a future Europe, according
to Germany's finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, Reuter reports from Bonn.
In an interview with the newspaper Nordkurier, he spelt out a vision of a
Europe of 'concentric circles', with Germany, France and some other
countries at the centre.
This appeared at odds with recent official denials that Bonn now envisaged a
possible two-tier, or two-speed, Europe in the wake of last month's currency
turmoil and doubts in some countries about aspects of the Maastricht treaty.
His remarks appeared to reflect a vigorous debate inside the German
government about how European integration should proceed.
Mr Waigel said he would not describe his view as a two-speed development,
but rather a Europe of concentric circles. He mentioned Germany, France, the
Benelux countries and Denmark as countries that could make up the nucleus
currency zone. It would have the D-Mark as anchor and develop into a joint
currency, which he termed the Europa-Mark.
Mr Waigel said he would not limit this inner circle of European countries to
the French franc and the mark.
'There are no barriers against including the Benelux countries and Denmark,'
he said, adding that such a Europe would also be possible with Austria and
Switzerland. 'The only determinants are economic, financial and stability
criteria,' he said.
'Around this circle a Europe will develop that consists of countries that
either belong to the European Community or want to belong. These countries
do not fulfil the criteria, but undertake efforts toward convergence.'
Last week Mr Waigel was quoted by members of his Christian Social Union
party as saying the Community would have to consider developing at different
speeds in the future because of the varying economic performance in member
countries. However, at the party meeting Mr Waigel did not call for a
two-speed Europe.
The meeting followed newspaper reports that Germany was seeking a
'mini-Europe' of its strongest economies or a currency merger with France.
Such plans were flatly denied by the government in Bonn.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Schlesinger rebuts British criticism
 -The German central bank chief states his case / Then the UK Treasury again
joins the fray
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE following statement was released yesterday morning by the German embassy
in London:
Comments by Bundesbank president Professor Dr Helmut Schlesinger on
reproaches made by some members of the British government.
1. Alleged indiscretions on the part of the Bundesbank. In my interview with
the German economic journal Handelsblatt, I expressly excluded the UK
currency from being endangered.
(The interview is reproduced in detail in the Handelsblatt of September 17,
1992: 'Schlesinger does not consider the situation of other currencies to be
so critical.
'He mentions the pound sterling, which has been under particularly heavy
pressure during the past few days. After all, he says, the British have
monetary reserves to enable them to defend sterling. Their situation is not
comparable to that of Italy. 'It seems to me that the EMS has strengthened
following the measures taken last weekend'.')
I would also draw attention to the fact that my colleague Dr Hans Tietmeyer
expressly supported the pound in public statements.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Dr Tietmeyer said on September 14, 1992:
Question: 'Do you consider a realignment of sterling to be necessary at
present? Sterling is still the sick man of the EMS.'
Answer: 'No. The British have already decided to defend the exchange rate,
and have taken the appropriate measures to that end.'
(See also the identical Reuters reports of the same date.)
The Bundesbank cannot be blamed for anonymous statements, rumours emanating
from market participants, inaccurate reproductions of statements by
newspapers; I reject all such statements.
2. The charge of lack of support for sterling in the foreign exchange market
by the Bundesbank.
With regard to support operations in the foreign exchange market, the
Bundesbank treated the pound sterling and the French franc alike in all
respects.
In this context, I may give you the following supplementary information:
The Bundesbank agreed to sizeable credit tranches denominated in D-Marks as
part of the borrowing operations by the UK Treasury.
Moreover, it granted the Bank of England a swap credit and also agreed to
prolong this swap arrangement.
The Bundesbank invariably agreed, as required under the EMS agreement, to
intramarginal D-Mark sales by the Bank of England, and also bought sterling
intramarginally in the market itself. The Bank of England did not ask the
Bundesbank to take any measures going beyond this.
After the UK currency had reached its lower intervention point, the
Bundesbank financed the requisite compulsory interventions in full. The
total amount of compulsory D-Mark sales in support of EMS currencies during
the week in which sterling and the Italian lira temporarily left the system
came to over DM44bn, the greater part of which was accounted for by
interventions vis-a-vis sterling. The compulsory D-Mark sales in favour of
sterling which we financed constitute by far the largest compulsory
interventions ever undertaken vis-a-vis a partner currency.
With respect to the support granted to sterling, the instruments used were
just the same as in the case of the support accorded to the French franc,
with the exception of the compulsory D-Mark sales, which did not take place,
because the French franc failed to reach the lower intervention point.
The high level of intervention in favour of sterling was primarily due to
the fact that the UK monetary authorities seem to have been prepared to
allow sterling to fall to its lower intervention point. The Banque de
France, by contrast, concentrated on keeping the franc rate above its
intervention point by means of intramarginal interventions.
The Bundesbank drew the logical consequences for its own monetary policy
from the realignment in the EMS, and adjusted German central bank rates
downwards as early as September 14, 1992. Already on the occasion of its
interest rate decisions of last July, the Bundesbank took care not to raise
its internationally relevant interest rate (the Lombard rate).
Since that time, interest rates in the German money market have fallen by
over one-half of a percentage point.
The measures designed to reduce tensions in the EMS include, pursuant to the
EMS agreement, not only intramarginal interventions and interest rate
changes but also the realignment of exchange rates.
The Bundesbank applied to the federal government on September 11 for
negotiations on such a realignment among the group of EMS partners; the
federal government complied with this request by initiating negotiations.
The outcome is well-known; it was the devaluation of but a single currency,
namely the Italian lira, even though, judging by the divergence indicator of
the EMS, sterling had overstepped the 'warning mark' of minus 75 already in
mid-August.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Defence of Lamont version of events
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS statement was released by the British Treasury yesterday afternoon in a
prompt response to the document released by the German embassy in London.
Late last night Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign minister, added their names to the Treasury statement.
On Monday, the German Ambassador called on the Permanent Under Secretary to
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and handed over a paper sent to him
personally by the Bundesbank President Dr Schlesinger. The paper sought to
rebut allegations over the Bundesbank's recent conduct in relation to
sterling. The Ambassador asked that the paper be considered confidential.
Earlier today and without warning, the German Embassy, on behalf of the
Bundesbank, made available an almost complete version of the paper.
The first point Dr Schlesinger makes is that in his interview with
Handelsblatt, published on Thursday 17 September, he was supportive of
sterling's position.
However, this misses the point. By 17 September, sterling had been forced
out of the ERM. The problem arose not from the reports published on 17
September, but from what was published on the morning of 16 September, early
reports of which began to circulate on the evening of 15 September.
This earlier version said: 'In an interview with the Handelsblatt and Wall
Street Journal, (Dr Schlesinger) conceded that the problems had not been
completely solved by the measures so far. The situation in the EMS could
have been further eased if there had been a more comprehensive realignment.'
Against a history of reports emanating from the Bundesbank, this was
inevitably interpreted as a reference to sterling.
On learning of these reports, the UK authorities asked Dr Schlesinger if
these reports were true, and, if they were not, whether he would issue a
clear denial.
Eventually, and after sterling had fallen outside its ERM bands in New York
trading, the Bundesbank issued a statement saying: 'The text was not
authorised. He did not say that, and it was not what he intended to say.'
The markets and the media did not find this a convincing denial with very
damaging effects for sterling. Had the version eventually published on 17
September been issued instead, events may have turned out differently.
Later in the paper, Dr Schlesinger claims that the Bundesbank undertook
substantial intervention in support of sterling.
The UK Government has never claimed that the Bundesbank did not comply with
its technical obligations under the ERM. We have simply noted the very
public way in which statements of support for the franc were made, in
contrast to the undermining statements made in relation to sterling.
Finally the paper implies that the Bundesbank sought a realignment of
several currencies on the weekend of 11/12 September.
No request was made by the German authorities to the UK on that weekend that
it too should realign.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, British foreign secretary, said yesterday that the UK did
not intend to propose alterations or amendments to the Maastricht treaty at
the summit on Europe's future in Birmingham in mid-October.
However, he made clear at a news conference in Bonn after talks with Mr
Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, that he did not rule out unspecified
'additions' to the treaty.
Mr Hurd will today offer a vigorous defence of the Maastricht agreement,
coupled with a warning that the UK's interests are unlikely to be as
well-served without the treaty, when he addresses a meeting in London
organised by the European Policy Forum, a think-tank.
In a speech which will set the UK government's line of argument in the
coming months, Mr Hurd is expected to argue that Maastricht represents the
opposite of a blueprint for a federal Europe.
'We must listen to what voices across Europe are saying about the Maastricht
treaty,' Mr Hurd said.
The UK government is warning its domestic critics that abandoning the
agreement could jeopardise UK interests in other parts of the EC agenda such
as the completion of the single market, enlargement and the legitimacy of
inter-governmental agreements as a basis for co-operation.
The argument will be strengthened by the message from German leaders, that
enlargement would not be possible unless Maastricht is accepted.
In a joint appearance after the meeting, the foreign ministers agreed that
the recent tensions between the two governments would not damage the
fundamental good relationship they have.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Central bankers wounded by words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL bankers are not normally thought of as sensitive souls, but the
Bundesbank's reaction to the onslaught of political and press criticism it
has received over sterling's floating devaluation shows it can be upset by
words as well as deeds.
Yesterday, in a highly unusual step, the German central bank's four-page
defence of its statements and actions was released to UK newspapers through
the German embassy in London.
Although Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, will have
another chance to put his and the bank's case when he holds a press
conference tomorrow after the regular council meeting, he is unlikely to
unveil any surprises.
Despite some speculation about possible cuts in interest rates, the general
expectation is that the Bundesbank will leave them unchanged. It lowered its
Lombard rate by 0.25 percentage points to 9.5 per cent two weeks ago, with
the discount rate moving down half a point to 8.25 per cent. But this was in
response to the currency pressures which led to the lira's devaluation.
Most economists are not betting on any further action on Friday. There will
be a press conference after the meeting in Schwerin, northern Germany - a
usual occurrence after the council meetings held annually outside Frankfurt.
Mr Lothar Weniger, economist with Salomon Brothers in Frankfurt, said the
Bundesbank was prepared to cut interest rates further, but not yet. 'I don't
think they want to do anything to loosen their underlying stance,' he said.
With money supply rising well above target - M3, the broad monetary
aggregate, grew at an annualised rate of 9 per cent in August - the
Bundesbank will want to wait until expansion slows down sharply.
September's M3 growth figure is likely to be at least 10 per cent in the
wake of the heavy intervention to prop up European currencies. The
Bundesbank said its foreign exchange reserves soared by DM44bn (Pounds
17.3bn) in the week to September 23 as a result of support operations. It
has been acting to mop up liquidity in the money markets and thus alleviate
the impact on money supply, but will want to see subsequent monthly M3
expansion figures on a clear downward trend before relaxing policy further.
Nikko Europe, the London branch of the Japanese securities house, also
expects no rate movement on Friday. The next cuts would have to be justified
by domestic fundamentals 'and money supply growth and inflation militate
against this'. West German inflation figures for September showed a 0.3 per
cent rise over August and one of 3.6 per cent over last year; the annual
rate in August was 3.5 per cent.
While the D-Mark's revaluation against several European currencies will help
dampen inflation, Berliner Bank notes that important areas like services and
rents are not affected by this. Mr Dietrich Beier, the bank's chief
economist, said Germany would only cut rates further if there was a
realignment in the European Monetary System.
But without such external pressures, he saw no chance of rate cuts yet. 'I
see no scope for further easing'. Not only had inflation shown a slight rise
this month, but the Bundesbank was also concerned about the possible impact
on prices of the planned rise in value-added tax in January.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Personal communicator set for launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN international consortium including AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group,
and Matsushita of Japan, the world's leading consumer electronics company,
is poised to win the race to launch the first 'personal communicator' - a
combined pocket telephone and personal computer.
The consortium, also including Marubeni, the large Japanese trading house,
and EO, a Californian computer designer, will today announce a partnership
to market a family of portable communicators combining voice telephony,
electronic mail, facsimile and a personal word processor accepting
handwritten input.
Development work is complete and the first of the devices is expected to be
announced by the end of the year. The first personal communicators will
probably cost as much as a notebook computer - about Dollars 1,000 (Pounds
580) - but prices are expected to fall sharply as sales volumes grow. Mr
Alain Rossman, chief executive of EO, said: 'Personal communicators
integrate telephony, messaging and computing to create a compelling new
device which will have as much impact on person-to-person communications as
the telephone had in the early 1900s.'
The consortium is in talks with a potential European partner with a view to
strengthening its marketing position.
It is the latest example of a growing number of cross-industry and global
alliances being formed as advances in technology start to erode the
boundaries between the computer, consumer electronics and telecommunications
industries. It is understood that the partners have subscribed a total of
Dollars 38m to bring the devices to market.
Personal communicators are examples of a new class of portable devices,
combining the power of personal computers and the communications
capabilities of cellular telephones.

FT  01 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Carpeting for Sir Leon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission decision to clear Du Pont's acquisition of the ICI
nylon business will surely leave Sir Sydney Lipworth chuckling into his
cornflakes. The chairman of the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission, it
will be remembered, caused something of a stir earlier this year when he
suggested that Brussels' role in competition matters must be made more
transparent. Yesterday's case, which concerned the concentration of nylon
fibres for carpet making, appears to prove his point. Rumour and leaks have
created an impression that the EC's Merger Task Force made one
recommendation on competition grounds - and that the compromise solution now
announced by Sir Leon Brittan reflects wider considerations. It is too much
to expect politicians not to meddle, but not unreasonable to demand that
they tell us how they do it.
To be fair to Brussels, the EC authorities probably got the first bit right.
ICI and Du Pont argued fiercely that the regulators should look at the
polypropylene and nylon fibres market as a whole, but influenced no doubt by
squeals of protest from the carpet manufacturers the European Commission
decided that Du Pont's 43 per cent combined share was too much. The problem
is the tortuous set of undertakings intended to maintain competition, which,
as with the Nestle/Perrier conditions, contain alarming echoes of a
dirigiste industrial policy approach.
In mineral waters the idea was to create a third force in the French market.
This time the plan is that Du Pont will hand over production capacity and
R&amp;D facilities - comparable in quality to its own - to an as yet unnamed
third party. Quite how this will be policed is a mystery, but it seems a
safe bet that given its dependent status the new player will not provide as
effective competition for Du Pont as ICI has in the past.

   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday approved the planned swap of chemical
assets by Du Pont of the US and Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK, but
imposed strict and detailed conditions on the deal.
The compromise was put together by Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition
commissioner, and the two companies.
Under the original deal, ICI would have swapped its nylon interests for Du
Pont's acrylic business and Dollars 431m (Pounds 246m) cash. The EC's merger
task force said the deal should be blocked as it would give Du Pont 43 per
cent of the market by value in nylon carpet fibre.
Sir Leon's solution - which avoids the political repercussions of blocking
the swap - will force Du Pont to transfer 12,000 tonnes of ICI's nylon
carpet fibre capacity to a competitor. The British group's annual capacity
is 45,000 tonnes and the sale will bring the combined group's share of the
market down to 38 per cent. Du Pont had insisted the deal would give the
company only 14 per cent of the overall carpet fibre market.
The proposal was approved by commissioners without a vote, but competition
experts outside the commission said they were concerned by the implications
that competitors would have to co-operate closely. Sir Leon and his advisers
argued that the nature of the fibres business allowed capacity transfers
without jeopardising competition.
The swap of assets has to be cleared by the US Federal Trade Commission. ICI
is acquiring Du Pont's Dollars 300m acrylic business and will be the US's
second largest acrylics manufacturer. The conditions are among the most
complex Brussels has imposed. Du Pont will also have to:
Sell an entire research and development facility, including technical
personnel, to the same competitor;
Manufacture under contract to the competitor for at least five years;
Give the competitor exclusive rights to ICI's 'Timbrelle' trade mark, which
is carried on about 80 per cent of the British company's carpet fibre
production.
Competition officials said the capacity and related facilities must be sold
to a single competitor, which would have to be a fibres manufacturer.

FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: IEL defers ADollars 2bn
flotation of Woolworths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fall-out from a failed ADollars 1.2bn (Dollars 883m) rights issue by
Westpac Banking Corporation yesterday prompted Industrial Equity (IEL), part
of the Adsteam group formerly controlled by Mr John Spalvins, to defer the
ADollars 2bn flotation of its Woolworths retailing subsidiary.
In a separate announcement, Adsteam reported a net loss of ADollars 746m
after abnormal items for the year to June. The group said the result was not
comparable with its loss of ADollars 1.57bn in the previous year, which was
determined on a different accounting basis.
IEL, which is jointly-owned by the three main companies in the Adsteam
group, said market conditions had changed significantly since the Woolworths
float was announced in August, creating 'a particularly unfavourable
climate'.
The company said it had been told by JB Were, the lead underwriter, that it
was impossible to underwrite the issue at a satisfactory price. 'Directors
are not prepared to enter into a sale at what they consider will prove to be
at a level which does not reflect the true value of Woolworths,' the board
said. JB Were agreed in August to underwrite a minimum capital raising of
ADollars 1.95m, but is understood to have failed to find sub-underwriters at
the reduced level of ADollars 1.85m.
The reluctance of institutions to support the float follows the failure last
week of the Westpac rights issue, which was 72 per cent undersubscribed.
The prospects for the Woolworths flotation have been undermined by a
weakening in the Australian share market and the announcement of a
discounted ADollars 1bn rights issue by Foster's Brewing Group.
However, Mr Simons said he expected the flotation to go ahead 'when the
markets are quite stable and there is no risk attached either to investors
or the vendor'.
In its results announcement, Adsteam said it made a profit of ADollars 336m
before deducting tax of ADollars 24m, finance costs of ADollars 638m and
abnormal losses of ADollars 420m, mainly related to property write-downs by
IEL.
Woolworths made an operating profit of ADollars 247m on turnover of ADollars
9.2bn, compared to profits of ADollars 218m on turnover of ADollars 8.2m in
the previous year.

FT  01 OCT 92 / EC close to road tax plan for lorries: Commission proposal
moves Europe closer to single haulage market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday adopted a plan for a mutually agreed
system of road tax discs for EC lorries.
The move is regarded as an essential step for member states to open up their
road haulage markets to each other within the single market due on stream
from January next year.
The plan, announced by Mr Karel van Miert, transport commissioner, is likely
to get approval from the 12, because otherwise individual member states like
Germany are expected to go ahead with national road tax systems likely to
discriminate against outside hauliers.
The Commission's proposal follows a European Court of Justice ruling against
German plans unilaterally to introduce a road tax which foreign lorries
would have to pay. It was put together on Germany's urging.
The measure is scheduled to be decided before the end of the year, to come
into effect in January 1994, and will apply only to motorways and lorries
over 12 tonnes.
The object of the tax is to enable member states to recover infrastructure
costs from their road networks, and also to make railway transport more
attractive. Germany, for instance, has said it plans to use the revenue to
modernise its railways.
But no less important is the now improved prospect of the 12 agreeing to
road cabotage - allowing hauliers from one member state to pick up and
deliver goods inside another member state.
Many countries have blocked opening up the road haulage market for fear that
their own industry would be undercut. Road hauliers in Belgium, for
instance, pay less than a third of the German road tax on a 38-tonne lorry,
and would be correspondingly more competitive if allowed to operate inside
Germany.
National restrictions on outside road hauliers mean that up to a fifth of
European Community lorries are driving around empty at any given time.
The Commission is suggesting an Ecu929 (Pounds 725) a year minimum tax per
40 tonnes of lorry as a reference, but setting no upper limit.
The discs should be easily obtainable, for variable periods of days, weeks
and months, and imply neither discrimination against outside hauliers nor
border checks, Commission officials said. Where, as in France, a toll system
already operates, no change is envisaged.
Officials say governments will be able to reimburse their hauliers for
excessive costs incurred abroad, apparently at French insistence.
Hauliers from poorer peripheral countries such as Greece, Ireland and
Portugal are expected to lose most heavily, because of the distances they
have to travel.
But the final draft of the Commission proposal invokes article 99 of the
Treaty of Rome, covering taxation and requiring unanimity, whereas the
previous intention was to put it through the member states by majority vote,
solely under Article 75 on transport policy.
The possibility of a national veto makes it easier for the poorer countries
to extract concessions.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Bribery of BR staff alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Rail officials were bribed with holidays, lavish meals and trips to
Continental night clubs over a 10-year period to help Plasser Railway
Machinery GB, the rail maintenance suppliers, to win contracts from BR, an
Old Bailey jury was told yesterday.
The widespread bribery was a systematic attempt to corrupt many staff within
BR's civil engineering department. The court was told that far more people
had been involved than the three men on trial.
Plasser Railway Machinery (GB) Ltd, Mr Norbert Jurasek, the company's
managing director, and Mr Michael Brooks, Plasser's company secretary, all
deny nine charges of offering bribes to Mr David Currie, a former head of
BR's civil engineering department, in order to win contracts from BR.
Mr Currie denies nine charges of corruptly accepting the alleged bribes,
which included air tickets from London to South Africa, Chicago and Dublin,
a trip on the Orient Express, a case of champagne and a ticket to watch
rugby at Twickenham.
All three men and the company also deny one charge of conspiring to corrupt
other BR staff.
Opening the case for the prosecution, Mr Michael Worsley QC said the nine
transactions before the court were only 'a mere sample' of the conduct that
took place between 1978 and 1988. A 'mass' of benefits had been offered to
Mr Currie and other people in BR's civil engineering division, he said.
'If there were a charge on the indictment for every transaction of giving
and accepting, the courtroom would be full of defendants and the indictment
would be a mile long,' Mr Worsley told the court.
Mr Jurasek and Mr Brooks were being prosecuted because they were 'at the
heart' of what had happened. Mr Currie was the only BR employee to be
prosecuted, since he had taken more gifts than anyone else and was the most
senior BR employee involved.
Mr Currie received his first gift from Plasser - which depended on BR for 95
per cent of its business - in 1978 when, on a trip to Malaysia, the company
took him out to dinner.
'From that small beginning, the value of the benefits grew,' Mr Worsley
said.
In 1985, Mr Currie became the head of BR's civil engineering department and
benefits to him came in a 'flood'. Plasser paid for Mr Currie to visit
Henley and travel to South Africa and New York. The benefits allowed him to
live the life of a rich man, Mr Worsley said.
Because of the large scale of the benefits from Plasser, the only
interpretation that could be put upon them was that they were corrupt, he
continued. No company would have paid for as much as Plasser had without
expecting something in return.
In Plasser's London offices, a confidential list was kept of who should
receive Christmas presents. Mr Worsley said that Mr Brooks had told his
secretary, a former Metropolitan policewoman: 'These lists are dynamite if
they get into the wrong hands.'
Mr Brooks also told her that Plasser was able to succeed in business only
because of the gifts it provided, Mr Worsley said.
The trial continues today.

FT  01 OCT 92 / People: European Leisure makes two key appointments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European Leisure, the deeply troubled disco and snooker hall owner that is
grappling with a mountain of debt as well as being the subject of an
uncompleted Serious Fraud Office investigation, has hired a new
non-executive chairman and group finance director. But yesterday's
announcement failed to lift the shares which languish at 2 3/4 p.
Clive Bastin, 55, national managing partner of accountants Spicer &amp;
Oppenheim until shortly before it merged with Touche Ross, will be
non-executive chairman. He replaces Geoffrey Nichols, who had been standing
in since last July when Michael Ward resigned from his position as chairman
andchief executive. Since leaving Spicer, Bastin has been developing a
portfolio of interests; he is deputy chairman of Frogmore Estates and of
Clarke Hooper, and he came recommended by a merchant bank, according to Ian
Rock, group managing director.
Replacing Christopher Critchlow, who stepped down as finance director in
April because he did not want to relocate with the company to
Leicestershire, is Patrick Hooper. Hooper, 44, has been at booksellers
Pentos since 1977, latterly as group finance director. Asked why he should
wish to leave the booksellers for European Leisure, Ian Rock commented: 'He
understands retailing, and obviously he was attracted by the opportunity to
move forward from what is perceived as a low base.' Hooper was unavailable
for comment yesterday.
European Leisure, which owns the Hippodrome and Camden Palace discos, is in
the midst of a programme of disposals in France and Mallorca, but this has
been proceeding more slowly than expected because of the recession and lack
of bank lending, Rock explains. When the company reported results for the
six months ending December 31 1991, bank borrowings stood at Pounds 76m, a
gearing ratio of 217 per cent. Rock says the SFO investigation, connected
with the 1990 acquisition of Midsummer Leisure, does not concern the current
management: 'We rarely hear from them. It is almost as if it (the
investigation) doesn't exist.'
*****
Richard Burgess, finance director of SPEYHAWK, has been appointed finance
director of Chartwell Land, the property subsidiary of KINGFISHER; Robert
Fish, finance director of Speyhawk's principal trading subsidiaries, has
been appointed group finance director in his place.
*****
Jean-Pierre Garnier, president North America pharmaceuticals, has been
appointed to the main board of SMITHKLINE BEECHAM.
*****
Garry Campbell has been appointed md of the UK import and distribution
division of TKM, part of INCHCAPE.
*****
Yves Dominioni has been appointed president directeur generale of Atal, a
subsidiary of BULLOUGH.
*****
Paul Matthews has been appointed group finance director and company
secretary of CAKEBREAD ROBEY.
*****
Richard McClean (above), deputy chief executive of the Financial Times, is
stepping down next July after 38 years with the group.
McClean's FT career started in the advertisement department and he became
the first advertisement director to join the FT board. He was appointed FT
managing director under Alan Hare and has been deputy chief executive to
Frank Barlow and David Palmer, the current chief executive. He developed the
'No FT .. no comment' campaign and played a leading role in expanding the
paper's printing and circulation outside the UK.
He says he intends to continue in business and will retain his enthusiasm
for the 'whole area of media and communications'.
Outside the newspaper, his interests include Roman remains and charitable
activities at Trident Trust which provides work experience for young people.
*****
Nigel Horne (below right) has been appointed non-executive chairman of
Alcatel Network Systems UK, a subsidiary of Alcatel, the French
telecommunications manufacturing giant.
Horne, a well-known figure in the UK telecommunications industry, was
director of technology at STC, the electronics group, until its takeover by
Canada's Northern Telecom in 1990. Before that, he worked for GEC, the
electronics group.
Alcatel Network Systems UK was established last year mainly to market
Alcatel's telecommunications infrastructure products in the UK. Horne, 52,
is its first chairman.

FT  01 OCT 92 / Modern art depressed: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S sale yesterday of medium-quality British and Irish modern pictures
offered a good snapshot of the state of the contemporary art market. It was
predictably depressing, with a total of Pounds 332,362 and 44 per cent
unsold.
Ms Susie Pollen, expert in charge, said the auction confirmed that demand is
patchy and unpredictable. Dealers have virtually disappeared as buyers and
the taste of private collectors is variable.
Irish paintings did best, with The Red Table by Colin Middleton beating its
estimate at Pounds 10,285 and Winter in Galway by Jack Butler Yeats selling
within forecast at Pounds 9,922. A typical marine picture by Edward Seago
made Pounds 10,285, the bottom of its estimate. Dull pictures and modern
abstracts were particularly ignored, although the trend was bucked by
Untitled 1960, by Adrian Heath, which did well at Pounds 9,317.
Even in a depressed antiques market, exceptional items still sell. A Thomas
Tompion ebony miniature striking bracket clock from the early 1690s sold at
Christie's yesterday for Pounds 85,800, within estimate. In 1951 Christie's
had auctioned it for 1,800 guineas.
A similar Tompion clock reflected the caution in the market by selling for
Pounds 49,400, below forecast. It had belonged to the celebrated furniture
collector Geoffrey Blackwell. A walnut bracket timepiece by Joseph Knibb
from the Blackwell collection was just above target at Pounds 35,200.
The surprise of the session, which totalled Pounds 441,000 with 11 per cent
unsold, was a silver-cased perpetual calendar astronomical carriage
timepiece made in 1897 by Joseph Jump. It sold for Pounds 52,800, around
twice its estimate.
Christie's Swire had a disappointment at its Hong Kong sale of Chinese art
when the top lot, an important wood sculpture of the Buddhist Goddess of
Mercy, carved in the 12th century AD, was unsold at HKDollars 7.5m (Pounds
530,000).
