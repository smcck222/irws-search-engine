INDIA'S federal government sacked three state governments ruled by a
pro-Hindu party yesterday and placed them under direct rule following
vicious communal riots sparked by the razing of a mosque, Reuter reports
from New Delhi.
An official said the decision was taken at a cabinet meeting presided over
by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, prime minister, and conveyed to President Shankar
Dayal Sharma.
A presidential proclamation said Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal
Pradesh, ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had been brought under
New Delhi's direct rule.
Mr Rao has been under pressure from within the cabinet and the ruling
Congress party to sack the three BJP-ruled governments to make a ban on
several religious groups effective. The official said the cabinet's decision
was based on the reports of the governors of the three states.
The BJP government of northern Uttar Pradesh state was dismissed immediately
after the razing of the mosque in Ayodhya by frenzied Hindu mobs on December
6.
The government last Thursday banned the Rashtriya Swaymsevak Sangh (RSS),
the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP, World Hindu Council) and the Bhajarang Dal,
all linked with the BJP and the temple campaign. It also banned two Moslem
religious groups.

A SMALL contingent of US Marines moved into the lawless Somali town of
Baidoa last night and took control of the disused airstrip to prepare for
the arrival within hours of a much larger military intervention force.
Colonel Mohammed Gutaale, commander of airport security in the terrorised
town, refused to let foreigners beyond the airport perimeter last night and
said: 'The Marines are in control of the airport now. You cannot come in.'
The seizure of Baidoa airport under cover of darkness is the first
penetration by US military of Somalia's starvation-ridden interior. It
marked the start of the second phase of Operation Restore Hope. Commandos at
the airport were last night preparing for the arrival of US Marine
reconnaissance units expected between midnight and 4am local time.
Up to 700 US and French soldiers will take the town by road in a 70-vehicle
armoured convoy and by air from Cobra combat helicopters at twilight.
As many as 100 people a day are dying in Baidoa. The decrepit 'City of
Death', at the centre of the starvation zone, is a critical objective for
the US-led operation to provide security for the delivery of relief to up to
2m Somalis at risk of death by starvation.
Gunmen, who have been on an orgy of looting and violence in the past week,
huddled in groups near ramshackle tea stalls in Baidoa late yesterday
afternoon discussing if they should leave before foreign troops arrived.
Isolated gunshots echoed throughout the day as gunmen reportedly tried to
loot diesel fuel and food and settle final scores before hiding their
weapons and withdrawing their battle wagons from the streets.
The seizure of the airport came hours after Mr Robert Oakley, the US special
envoy in Somalia, held final talks in Baidoa with local clan-faction leaders
and aid workers. Mr Oakley told clan leaders and Somali elders that the US
forces were coming simply to assist aid workers efforts to deliver food to
the starving. He urged them to co-operate with the troops in their policing
mission.
In a meeting with dispirited aid workers Mr Oakley said the soldiers had
been making sensible preparations for the operation. 'We are not
anticipating a military threat here but as always we are coming prepared,'
Mr Oakley said before returning to the airport in a battered all-terrain
vehicle with armed gunmen sitting on the roof.
He also warned Somalis and foreigners to stay away from the airport and
said: 'After midnight be very careful until troops get settled down.'
Aid workers who have been holed up in compounds fortified by sandbags and
machine-gun emplacements on roofs expressed hope the US military
intervention would allow them to get back to serious work.
At makeshift roadside garages mechanics repaired axles and spare wheels and
tuned engines to ensure cars could make a speedy getaway.
Residents pushed donkey carts or broken-up wheelbarrows loaded with sacks of
US wheat and EC vegetable oil off the streets behind the walls of compounds
fearing foreign troops might confiscate plundered relief supplies.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Crisis-ridden Kenya limps to the ballot box: An economy
battered by corruption and mismanagement is key issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S first multi-party election campaign enters its final fortnight amid
allegations of state-sponsored violence, intimidation and manipulation of
the nomination process.
The allegations have overshadowed what will nonetheless be a key issue when
voters go to polls on December 29 - the state of the country's economy,
battered by corruption and mismanagement.
Opposition parties are focusing on the government's poor economic record,
alleging continued corruption and lack of commitment to reform. Across the
country opposition politicians are telling farmers, workers and the growing
millions of unemployed that the government of President Daniel arap Moi has
failed to realise Kenya's potential.
'This election is make or break for the economy,' said Mr Robert Shaw,
economic adviser to the main opposition grouping Ford-Kenya. 'Only the
opposition have the will to put the economy back on track and raise living
standards for ordinary Kenyans.'
International donors, who last November suspended about Dollars 300m a year
of aid to Kenya until the government re-introduced democracy and beefed up
its economic reform efforts, also view the election as critical for Kenya's
economic future. Many have come to see an opposition victory, on a
well-thought-out programme of emergency economic measures, as the only way
out of a gathering crisis.
An International Monetary Fund team which visited Kenya in September to
asses a shadow reform programme gave the country what one donor called 'a
C-minus grade'. Real per capita income growth is set to decline for a second
year, inflation has rocketed to 37 per cent, money supply creation is well
over the limits set in the budget, and the government has accumulated large
arrears on its Dollars 6.8bn external debt, raising the prospect of having
to negotiate its first debt rescheduling agreement.
The agricultural sector, which contracted by 1.1 per cent in 1991, is set
for further problems as a result of continued political intervention by
government institutions.
Politically sponsored corrupt deals this year, most notably in sugar
imports, and mounting evidence of government using the banking system to
fund its political campaign, have pushed the economic reform programme
further off track.
Donors say the government has made little progress on the three economic
issues that led to suspension of aid: corruption, a burgeoning budget
deficit and parastatal reform.
A document issued by the US embassy in Nairobi is typical of donor
discontent. It says Kenya has fallen on hard times due to 'simple, if all
pervasive, government mismanagement'. The report notes the increased
exposure of 'scandals highlighting the illegal diversion of massive
resources' and says: 'The government has failed to respond to the crisis,
instead it has avoided undertaking needed reforms and continues to
perpetuate large budgets, inefficient government-dominated production and a
selective award system to privileged groups.'
The task set by donors last November - carrying out austere reforms in
conjunction with political liberalisation - was always going to be difficult
for the government. During the past year some progress has been made in
foreign exchange liberalisation by the provision of foreign exchange export
retention accounts and in further price liberalisation.
A senior western economist in Nairobi says the money supply has expanded by
35 per cent this year on an annualised basis against an IMF target of 10 per
cent. Much of this money creation is going to swell the campaign war-chest
of the ruling party Kanu. The central bank is pumping in liquidity via the
'political banks' - those with political connections - through misuse of the
export pre-shipment finance scheme, which grew by Ksh10bn (Pounds 180m) this
year.
Donors are also angered by the government's recent decision to abolish its
programme of liberalising maize marketing, supported by millions of dollars
from the EC, US and World Bank. The government recentlybanned the free
movement of maize and made the inefficient and corrupt National Cereals
Produce Board the monopoly purchaser of maize.
According to western economists this move was politically motivated because
it gave the government control over which areas would receive maize in the
run-up to elections. 'If you don't support Kanu you won't get maize,' said
one diplomat.
Liberalisation of maize marketing has been a critical part of the
donor-funded agricultural reform drive since 1986, which, according to one
donor, is 'now back to square one'. In response to the government's move the
World Bank is considering cancelling its loan to the sector worth USDollars
35m. The EC has also suspended a Dollars 13m loan from its Stabex Fund as a
contribution to this year's crop purchase by the NCPB.
Another World Bank loan for export promotion worth Dollars 160m is also
being held back pending better macro-economic performance.
Furthermore, donors say that corruption has been on the increase. Throughout
the year the government awarded contracts to politically connected
businessmen to import at least 80,000 tonnes of sugar free of duty and
taxes.
Huge profits were made as artificial shortages were created to push up
consumer prices for imported sugar which, unlike domestically produced
sugar, is not price controlled. Imported sugar has sold throughout the year
at four times the price when landed at Mombasa.
In his annual report Kenya's Auditor-General revealed a number of serious
irregularities in state affairs, including financial deals involving the
Treasury and the ministry of lands and housing. The government has taken no
action on the report's findings.
Similar corrupt practices have been exposed in Kanu's political campaign
finances. In September, for example, the National Social Security Fund, the
state pension and social security body, paid Ksh1.2bn for two plots of land
worth only Ksh66m. The land was owned by Mr Cyrus Jirongo, the chairman of
Youth for Kanu 92, the organisation spearheading Kanu's electoral campaign.

<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK RABIN, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday promised a
'merciless' campaign against militant Islamic fundamentalists in the
occupied territories after a paramilitary policeman kidnapped at the weekend
was found murdered by a roadside in the West Bank.
But Mr Rabin told parliament his government would not be diverted by such
acts from its commitment to Middle East peace talks with the Palestinians -
as well as Syria, Jordan and Lebanon - currently going on in Washington.
He was speaking after the body of Border Police Sgt-Major Nissim Toledano
was found bound, strangled and stabbed and dumped close to the road from
Jerusalem to Jericho.
Sgt-Major Toledano was kidnapped early on Sunday by Qassam, the military
wing of the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas, which originally demanded
the release of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas jailed for life by
Israel. Although the government suggested it was prepared to discuss the
demand if it was assured Sgt-Major Toledano was still alive, there was no
further word from the abductors.
Mr Rabin said the kidnap, and the deaths of five other soldiers in the past
week, were intended 'to kill Jews and Israelis and to kill peace'.
In Washington Dr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the head of the Palestinian delegation,
said the effect of the violence was to 'reduce the credibility of the peace
talks'. Nevertheless, Israel has presented the Palestinians with a revised
agenda aimed at overcoming problems delaying agreement on an interim period
of Palestinian self-rule. It apparently goes some way to meeting Palestinian
demands that UN resolutions calling for an Israeli withdrawal from occupied
lands apply to the interim stage as well as to a final settlement.
International human rights groups and foreign correspondents in Israel
yesterday protested to Mr Rabin over the arrest on Monday night of Mr Taher
Shriteh, the leading resident journalist in the Gaza Strip.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday closed ranks with the US by stressing that its soldiers in
Somalia were under US operational command and that their mission was
primarily to escort food and medicine rather than to seize arms.
A conflict between respective French and US missions arose out of an
incident earlier this week, when French soldiers were ordered by a US
officer to return a machine-gun to Somalis who were said to be guarding food
supplies for an international aid agency. This drew criticism from the
French government which said that disarming the Somali population was in
line with the United Nations mandate.
But in Paris yesterday the defence ministry underlined that the 350 French
troops at present in the country were under the effective command of the
much larger US force.
The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that 'when French troops find arms in
the areas they control, they will take them,' leaving the impression that
they would not actively seek out weaponry for seizure.
Nevertheless, French support for a more active military role in both Somalia
and Bosnia is underlined in a CSA opinion poll published today. Eighty-two
per cent backed such a role in Somalia and 67 per cent in Bosnia. France has
4,500 soldiers in the ex-Yugoslavia.
Leslie Colitt adds from Berlin: A prominent US foreign policy adviser has
said the US military intervention in Somalia had other objectives besides
the outgoing administration's desire to alleviate starvation.
Mr Robert Hunter, a National Security Council member under former President
Carter, said the struggle over future planned reductions in US defence
spending also played a role.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Flights disrupted as pilots seek private rates of pay

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN businessmen, trying to recover from the disruption of the Ayodhya
crisis, have run into a more familiar difficulty - a strike by pilots of
Indian Airlines, Stefan Wagstyl reports from New Delhi.
The state-owned domestic carrier has been operating only about 25 per cent
of its normal flights since most pilots went on strike on Friday, throwing
the timetable into chaos. The pilots want pay increases to close the gap
with the salaries paid by India's newly created private airlines.
Indian Airlines management retorts that the private carriers' pilots are
much more productive than those at Indian Airlines. The managers also say
the pilots' pay is already excessively high. An official estimates the
average pilot receives about Rs30,000 (Pounds 670) a month, or about ten
times as much as a booking clerk and three times as much as the airline's
chairman.
The dispute highlights the problems of liberalisation. The government has
authorised private companies to operate scheduled routes to promote
competition and raise standards of efficiency at Indian Airlines and at
Vayudoot, a smaller state-owned carrier.
Seven new carriers have taken to the skies, including Bombay-based East West
Airlines, the largest, which has challenged Indian Airlines on some of its
busiest routes.
Passengers have reported dramatic improvements in service on routes where
Indian Airlines has to compete with East West. But Indian Airlines complains
that East West can cream off the best routes whereas Indian Airlines is
required to serve all corners of a vast country.
Indian Airlines adds that East West is poaching pilots. The state carrier,
which has 570 pilots, has lost about 30 this year to East West and other
operators. Their departure has increased the workload for the remaining
aircrew and fuelled the grievances which have led to the strike. The pilots
originally threatened disruptive action in October, but held back while
talks with the managers dragged on.
The strike this month coincides with high season for business and tourist
visitors to India. It will further harm confidence in the country, which has
already been battered by the violence which followed the sacking of the
mosque in Ayodhya by Hindu militants.
American, European and Japanese tour operators which have cancelled trips
because of the Ayodhya crisis see little reason to resume business with
India until the air strike is settled.
However, Indian Airlines says it cannot cave in to the pilots' demands if it
is to cut its losses as required by the government. To prove its
determination, it this week leased two Tu-154 airliners from the newly
created Uzbekistan Airlines, complete with crew, and plans to lease several
more if the strike continues.

A TEAM of United Nations pathologists today will oversee the excavation of
mass graves in eastern Croatia in the former Yugoslavia, amid calls from the
international community for the creation of a war crimes tribunal.
A team of pathologists and archaeologists is due to visit Ovcara, a village
near Vukovar in eastern Croatia devastated last year by the Yugoslav army.
They will dig up a grave where some 300 civilians and Croat soldiers are
feared to be buried in cornfields after being taken from Vukovar hospital
and executed by Serb forces when they seized the town in November last year.
It was uncertain whether local Serb authorities in the UN zone would try to
obstruct the investigation which could incriminate high-ranking Yugoslav
army officers. The UN team is headed by Mr Clyde Snow, an American
pathologist who has conducted similar investigations in Central America.
The excavation could produce evidence for a war crimes tribunal to try those
responsible for atrocities in Croatia and Bosnia.
The US and France are discussing creating a permanent international war
crimes court whose first task would be to try war criminals in former
Yugoslavia, the French foreign ministry said yesterday.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen yesterday made a surprise foray into Serbian
domestic politics with an appeal to voters to choose peace in this weekend's
presidential elections, Reuter adds from Geneva.
The co-chairmen of the Geneva conference seemed to urge support for moderate
candidate Mr Milan Panic when they said that 'this election will choose the
course of peace and not the policies of war'.
Mr Panic, who returned from California to become prime minister of the rump
Yugoslavia in July, is competing for the Serbian presidency against Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, the hardline nationalist incumbent

BRITAIN'S Prime Minister John Major expressed reservations yesterday about
military enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia, although he indicated
that the UK would not block such a move by other countries at the United
Nations.
Mr Major said enforcing a no-fly zone might hamper humanitarian efforts and
threaten UK troops. He added: 'We have never ruled out a possible need to
enforce the zone.'
A new UN Security Council resolution is being drafted by France to prevent
by force, if necessary, Serbian flights over Bosnia.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary-general of the
UN, had asked Nato to draw up plans for further military action, focusing on
enforcement of the no-fly zone.
Nato military authorities have already been working on what a senior
diplomat called 'limited and fairly specific contingency military planning'
for former Yugoslavia. This work has concentrated on enforcement by aircraft
of the flying ban, possible moves to establish safe areas for Bosnian
Moslems and ways of containing any spread of the conflict into the Serbian
region of Kosovo.
At Westminster some Tory MPs and the Labour leadership called for forceful
intervention. But Mr Major stressed that 'other measures' were under
consideration. Downing Street said these included stronger sanctions and
'international expressions of disgust' at Serbia's actions.
The British reservations were reiterated at a meeting in the margin of the
52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in
Stockholm between Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and his US and
French colleagues, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger and Mr Roland Dumas.
They will, no doubt, be voiced again at a special one-day conference on the
former Yugoslavia in Geneva today, at which Bosnia will be the main item on
the agenda. The conference will be attended by representatives of 29
countries.

<TEXT>
EC environment ministers last night agreed to end the use of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and some other chemicals which deplete the ozone
layer, by January 1995.
This is a year earlier than the targets agreed last month in Copenhagen by
the Montreal Protocol, the 93-nation pact governing action on the ozone
layer, where the EC had argued for faster phase-out of ozone-damaging
substances.
It was agreed in Copenhagen to reduce CFC use by 75 per cent by the end of
next year, and and phase them out entirely by 1996, four years ahead of the
pact's previous schedule. The Community had moved to the 1996 date in March,
and plans to eliminate 85 per cent of CFCs by the end of next year.
CFCs, used mostly in refrigeration, aerosols, air conditioning and
insulation, have done most to thin the ozone layer. Scientists predict an
increase in eye cataract conditions and skin cancer, caused by the
ultra-violet radiation the ozone layer filters out.
The EC will also phase out use of carbon tetrachloride, a dry-cleaning
solvent, by 1995, instead of 1996. Halons, used in fire-extinguishers, will
be eliminated by the end of next year instead of 2000, and trichloroethane,
used to clean precision instruments, will go by 1996 instead of 2000. This
keeps the EC dates agreed in March, despite efforts by Germany and the
Brussels Commission to speed up elimination.
Ministers also agreed to adopt tighter exhaust emission targets for light
trucks.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Italians redraw political map
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE irreversible process of political change in Italy has been underlined by
the results of municipal elections held on Sunday and Monday.
Italian municipal elections mirror general election voting patterns and,
with over 1m voters involved, this was a fair test of electoral opinion. The
outcome has confirmed the decline of the traditional parties in favour of
forces gathering a powerful protest vote, notably the populist Lombard
League.
The League, headed by Mr Umberto Bossi with his federalist anti-Rome
platform, has become the largest party in northern Italy. If the municipal
vote were translated on to a national scale in a general election, it would
be the second largest party with close to 15 per cent of the vote. The once
powerful Christian Democrats have seen their national vote fall from the
general election level of 29 per cent, a historic low, to below 24 per cent.
The Socialists have fared even worse with their share of the vote at 9 per
cent, and half this percentage in the North.
The political geography after the April general election showed Italy moving
towards a broad division into three areas - the north with the League
struggling for dominance; the centre, broadly controlled by the former
Communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS); and Rome and the south in the
hands of the Christian Democrats and the Socialists.
The map is now far more complex. The League has consolidated its position on
a larger scale in the north. In the key industrial cities of Monza and
Varese, it has 32 per cent and 37 per cent respectively of the municipal
vote, compared with 20 per and 27 per cent in April. Mr Bossi has also shown
the League is a force in the centre, doing well in La Spezia and Viareggio.
The PDS is under threat from its breakaway communist rival, Reconstructed
Communism which is attracting a mix of the young and Marxist nostalgics.
Equally significant, The Network (La Rete), the year-old clean government
movement has proved it can win votes up and down the country. Although it
has under 5 per cent of the vote, it has more than doubled its general
election performance.
The Network has stolen votes from Christian Democrats and Socialists as well
as the Republican Party which had hoped to profit by distancing itself from
the government. The Republicans' failure is part of a generalised voter
disenchantment with all the old parties. The exception here is the
neo-fascist, MSI, which has lifted its national vote by 2 per cent to over 7
per cent.
Italy's political parties are more fragmented than ever. This will be
emphasised as municipalities try to form viable alliances to run local
administrations.
The results have added urgency to the work of the 60 person joint
parliamentary commission studying electoral reform and constitutional
change. Without such proposals, it is hard to envisage early elections -
even if the coalition government looks fragile.
Prof Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, can argue with some
justification that electoral disenchantment is with the parties in his
coalition - not the government itself. Public opinion polls continue to show
him increasing his popularity despite unpopular measures.
Indeed, the disarray among the main government parties could be used to his
advantage since the old guard, hostile to his privatisation proposals, will
find it more difficult as a result of the municipal elections to sabotage
him on this key issue.

MEPs yesterday called on the European Commission to adopt legislation to
close loopholes in the single market, which is due to open on January 1.
But Commission and member states are likely to resist pressure to unleash a
new wave of law-making, which they believe would further alienate EC
citizens, as the first tide of legislation begins to ebb. Governments will
concentrate on implementing and enforcing existing laws.
With just over two weeks until the single market deadline, member states
have adopted all but 5 per cent of 282 measures in the June 1985 single
market white paper, which seeks to encourage the free movement of people,
goods, services and capital.
Internal market ministers of the 12 hope to agree on some of the outstanding
legislation when they meet tomorrow. They will try to agree temporary
measures allowing frontier controls on goods to be lifted, even though
systems for regulating movement of items such as explosives and art works
will not be in place by January 1.
In a report to the Parliament, Mr Ben Patterson, a British Conservative MEP,
yesterday proposed a new white paper setting new goals and 'correcting the
negative environmental and social impacts of the internal market'. His
report, prepared for the Parliament's committee on economic and monetary
affairs and industrial policy, says gaps exist in the single market,
including:
* a definitive system for collecting and monitoring value added tax, which
will not be in place until 1997 at the earliest;
* freedom for airlines to operate anywhere in the Community, which will not
be granted until April 1997;
* proposals for liberalisation of the EC energy market, which are opposed by
a majority of member states.
'We don't want to be too downbeat about the single market, because 95 per
cent of the legislation is there,' said Mr Patterson. 'But there is a strong
undercurrent that the job has not been completed.' Mr Martin Bangemann,
internal market commissioner, tried to reassure MEPs, saying EC citizens
would have a right to sue governments which had not properly implemented
single market legislation.
Reuter adds from Madrid: Nine EC countries yesterday approved a passport
sticker letting them abolish border controls for their own nationals and
other visitors, Mr Carlos Westendorp, Spain's state secretary for the EC,
said. The move meant travellers from most countries with a visa to visit any
one of the nine so-called Schengen group states would be able to enter the
others without checks.
Nationals from the nine would be able to move through each other's territory
with the hologrammed label. The nine comprise all EC states except Britain,
Denmark and Ireland, and plan to abolish internal frontiers before the EC as
a whole. Britain, Denmark and Ireland want to keep border checks for non-EC
nationals but the Schengen group will scrap controls on visitors from 120
countries who will be entitled to use the new sticker.

THE looming German recession will dampen inflation and money supply growth
and allow the Bundesbank to cut interest rates after next spring, a leading
government adviser said yesterday.
Mr Rudiger Pohl, one of the so-called five wise men, warned, however, that
the bank would move cautiously since it would have to take into account the
effects of rising US interest rates on the external value of the D-Mark.
The federation of German industry, BDI, said there was a danger that the
rapid deterioration in confidence could lead to a longer recession.
Production cuts would have to continue, the rate of lay-offs would
accelerate, and industrial capacity use would shrink further. At present
some 17 per cent of west German manufacturing capacity is idle.
An export-led recovery will begin in the second half of next year according
to most forecasts. However, the federal trade and industry association,
DIHT, said French reluctance to approve the farm production compromise in
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks could lead to a trade war.
This would obliterate hopes of improved exports.
There were no signs that domestic conditions would improve next year, which
would be the worst for the German economy since 1982, the DIHT said. In that
year industrial production fell by more than 3 per cent and gross national
product fell by more than 1 per cent.
Control of pay rises and government spending were especially important in
the battle against recession.
According to Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the Bundesbank's central council,
money supply growth would fall during November and December from the year's
10.3 per cent peak last month. Even so, it would still be well above target.
On inflation, the only positive sign so far was a drop in import prices.
This fall, of around 5 per cent, has stemmed mainly from the recent
appreciation of the D-Mark.
A critical point would be reached in January when Mr Issing expected
inflation to rise above 4 per cent after an increase in value added tax.

<TEXT>
THE appointment of Mr Hans van den Broek as the Netherlands EC Commissioner
means that one of the missing pieces in the forthcoming Commission reshuffle
jigsaw is now on the board.
Next Tuesday the 17-strong Commission meets in Brussels to parcel out top
jobs ranging from foreign affairs to competition for at least the next two
years. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, is almost certainly the
only person who knows how the pieces will fit into place.
In selecting his team, Mr Delors must balance personal egos and the national
interests of the Twelve, as well as obey a number of unwritten conventions
such as handing over the big ticket agriculture portfolio to a small state.
Mr van den Broek's high profile in foreign policy will add weight to the
Commission; but it is far from certain whether he can take over the bloated
external affairs portfolio held until now by Mr Frans Andriessen, the
outgoing Dutch commissioner.
There are four strong candidates for this job which makes it likely that it
will be split up. Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior commissioner now in
charge of competition, wants to hive off trade policy and relations with
Eastern Europe. France may back his bid because it sees him as over zealous
in cracking down on cartels and state aid.
Mr Martin Bangemann, Germany's EC senior industry commissioner, also wants
to swallow up the Commission's considerable trade responsibilities in an
effort to create what EC officials describe as a Japanese-style ministry of
trade and industry.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's highly regarded former foreign
minister, may also expect to take over some areas of foreign policy -
possibly responsibility for negotiating EC entry for Austria, Finland,
Sweden and probably Norway.
If Sir Leon were to surrender competition, a possible replacement is Mr
Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner now in charge of transport and
temporarily environment. Even Mr van den Broek is not excluded for this
heavyweight job.
Only Ireland has yet to nominate its commissioner to replace Mr Ray
MacSharry, the agriculture commissioner and EC farm trade negotiator. The
current betting is that the Irish candidate will take the sensitive social
affairs portfolio, with Ms Maire Geoghan-Quinn, transport minister in the
outgoing Dublin government, or Mr Barry Desmond, a Labour MEP and former
health minister, being tipped for the post.

THE ordinary people in whose name Mr Yegor Gaidar, the father of Russian
market reforms, was sacrificed this week, are remarkably sceptical of the
promise of kinder reform made by his successor, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin. 'I
welcome his promise but it's hard to believe. Yeltsin also promised there
would be no poverty. Can it be done? I believe it's all very difficult,'
said Ms Galina Viktorova, 49, at a Moscow radio factory.
'I don't believe him. There's no reason too. It's just words,' said Ms Anna
Fomenko, 38, who described herself as unemployed. 'Gaidar's reforms would
not have achieved anything either. But I don't believe in any of these
governments.'
Mr Gaidar's departure and the return of an old-style figure seem to have
prompted a certain amount of sympathy - in retrospect.
'People should not make promises but get on with things, at least Gaidar's
team told us what to expect,' said Mr Alexandr Parfyonov, a government
driver. 'I didn't like what Gaidar was doing of course but I felt sorry for
him because he was so clever,' said Ms Viktorova.
'As for his reforms, we didn't understand them and we were scared of prices
rising to the point where we would not be able to survive.'
For others, mostly professionals with money or ideals, Mr Gaidar had
provided freedom instead of bread. 'It's hard to say if Chernomyrdin will
carry out his promise.
'I don't now anything about him, even though I agree that stopping poverty
is the most urgent of tasks,' said Mr Andrei Rapninsky, 28, an engineer.
'But I liked what Gaidar did because of the freedom of choice it brought.'

FT  16 DEC 92 / Russia - The Future of Reform: PM and banker seen as
dangerous duo
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE appointment of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister has been greeted
with the same caution in Moscow's foreign business and diplomatic community
as it has been abroad.
Mr Chernomyrdin is little known outside Russia, nor is he known beyond the
energy sector in the country. Those working in the sector have mixed views.
'He has done nothing (as energy minister) for 12 months,' said one
experienced mineral resources professional.
'He is a good, straightforward industrial manager,' said another.
The comments of foreign business need to be set against a depressed
commercial environment: a number of representative offices, notably the big
Siemens presence, are cutting or are not filling vacant posts.
The huge drop in orders for western goods, and the slow and so far largely
unrewarding experience of joint ventures, has long punctured the bubble of
enthusiasm in the Russian economy. The balance of diplomatic comment is that
he will continue reforms which are anyway difficult to stop in principle -
such as privatisation.
However, some believe he will be a dangerous man to combine with Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman who has said he puts industrial
needs before purely financial ones. Mr Chernomyrdin confirmed this
impression yesterday at his first press conference, when he said that 'the
first issue is to stop the decline in industry and we will need a certain
amount of spending and finance for this'. On the threat of hyperinflation,
he said he was 'thinking about it'.
However, 'the simple formula, Gaidar equals reform, no Gaidar equals no
reform, is clearly not applicable here,' according to a senior western
economic counsellor. 'Mr Chernomyrdin has said he's more friendly to
industry, but Gaidar was speaking about an industrial policy too. The new
prime minister will be working within the same parameters as the previous
prime minister.'
Mr Chernomyrdin said he wanted 'normal co-operation' with foreign
businessmen (he met a group of German business leaders yesterday after talks
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl) and said that he was quite ready to keep the US
advisers presently working with the government - 'and there will certainly
be some Germans, and Russians. 'The important thing is whether they want to
help us,' he said.
Meanwhile, the change in leadership is expected to further delay
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on a full standby
agreement, which would allow Russia to borrow up to Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn) from the Washington-based institution. Delays are also expected in
loan negotiations with the World Bank.
A meeting between IMF officials and the Russian government to review
progress towards economic reform which had originally been scheduled for
Friday has now been put off till January 11. Even on optimistic assumptions
about Russia's ability to implement a reform programme that will satisfy the
IMF, it would take at least three months after that to complete a standby
agreement.
However, IMF officials point out that they have already lived through one
change of government in Russia, having started negotiations with the
government of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and his economic adviser, Mr Grigori
Yavlinsky.
Russian ministers said when they joined the Fund last spring that they hoped
to complete a standby agreement by the end of May (1992).
However, international bankers say the country has only drawn Dollars 300m
so far from a Dollars 1bn preliminary IMF credit tranche which was not
conditional on a reform programme.
Bankers say the reason for Russia's failure to use the IMF money is not
clear, but the most prominent explanation is that the interest rates are too
high. Washington monetary sources say that western financial aid has
continued to flow to Russia, despite the absence of an economic reform
programme that they would regard as adequate.

and the legacy

<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Yegor Gaidar, the 36-year-old who launched market reforms in Russia,
was made prime minister a year ago he had one primary goal: to make change
irreversible through Polish-style shock therapy and sheer improvisation.
His successor as Russia's prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, is more
ambitious: he wants to halt the fall in industrial output (20 per cent this
year) and to 'civilise' what Mr Gaidar bequeathed him so that Russia 'has a
market and not a bazaar'.
He is unlikely to be able to do so, at least not in the near future. This is
because of what Mr Gaidar did achieve - and what he did not. His market
reforms - kick-started with price liberalisation - are, as he had hoped,
irreversible. But his attempts at financial stabilisation failed.
Monthly inflation is running at 33 per cent (close to the 50 per cent at
which point it is called 'hyperinflation'). The budget deficit is pushing 15
per cent of gross domestic product, close to the level last year when the
then Soviet Union's financial system had all but collapsed.
Thus Mr Gaidar's muddling through on financial policy could be followed by a
hyperinflationary nightmare if Mr Chernomyrdin tries to stop an
'impoverishment which the people do not deserve' by quickly wiping out the
arrears accumulated between enterprises without tackling their causes. The
only way this could be done would be by creating even more credit and
handouts, without discrimination, than is already the case.
'People would be made even poorer through hyperinflation,' says Ms Elena
Kotova, a Russian economist and former privatisation official now with the
World Bank.
She said price liberalisation was one of the factors making reform
irreversible, saying the government had already lost the tools it would need
to re-impose controls on prices, wages and centralised distribution of
goods.
While other economists disagree, saying some price controls could be
reimposed, the consensus is that Mr Gaidar's privatisation policy is the
jewel in the crown of his legacy, the only guarantor that reforms may be
slowed but not reversed.
Although the privatisation of large-scale enterprises has only just begun,
the legislation and mechanisms for its implementation are solidly in place.
Enterprises have spent months preparing privatisation plans. Citizens
holding vouchers entitling them to buy shares or exchange them for money
cannot now be told the programme is cancelled. Many directors see their own
success as being tied to taking their enterprises away from the control of
the state, despite the risks. Few have asked to be taken off the list of
enterprises to be sold off.
By contrast, the main shortcoming of Mr Gaidar's legacy - which has exposed
him to attack from conservatives - is that structural reforms have not yet
filled the vacuum created by the freeing of prices, trade, and wages.
Though shops created by the freeing of trade have helped improve supplies in
more remote parts of the country, the most irritating and visible sign of
change for many Muscovites is the little kiosks which sell imported liquor,
cigarettes and clothes at most street corners and the rich traders who race
around Moscow in expensive foreign cars.
The 'bazaar' of which Mr Chernomyrdin complained can be dealt with in only
two ways. So-called 'wild' trade can either be shut down or nurtured through
a long-term strategy proclaimed, but not started, by Mr Gaidar.
This includes the need for a tough industrial policy that will sacrifice
bits of industry that are using up resources that could be put into consumer
goods production and switching an overdeveloped military industry to
civilian uses. All Mr Gaidar did was slash procurement for military
industry, but far from disappearing, enterprises keep going, expecting - and
ultimately receiving - handouts from the government and central bank.
'As long as industry is not seriously restructured, the only sector where
market mechanisms come to play are in trade,' said one western expert. 'But
this quickly turns to speculation, making profits from reselling scarce
goods, rather than producing more of them.'
Another aspect of Mr Gaidar's legacy is the strengthening of a small
entrepreneurial class which is not only confident enough to display its
wealth but to lobby and influence authorities at both local and central
level.
Although the shoots of entrepreneurship are here to stay, they are fragile.
Their main failure so far is that lawlessness and bureaucracy are such that
they discourage ordinary people with good ideas from setting up their own
businesses.
All the evidence points to only one set of sensible policies for a man with
centralising instincts: a vigorous industrial strategy which allows for some
enterprises and sectors to close down, coupled with action to create jobs.
Mr Chernomyrdin has the political support which Mr Gaidar lacks, but whether
he will use it wisely is unclear.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Russia - The Future of Reform: Moscow to seek deal for
Dollars 16bn of debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Paris Club of government creditors of the former Soviet Union is being
asked this week to finalise a rescheduling agreement for more than Dollars
16bn (Pounds 10.5bn) in outstanding sovereign debts now assumed by the
Russian government.
The deal, allowing for repayment over 10 years, with a five-year grace
period on payments of principal, would open the way for a commercial
rescheduling agreement of debts totalling more than Dollars 20bn by the
so-called London Club of some 600 commercial bank creditors of the former
Soviet Union.
Both deals to reschedule payments falling due in 1993 will have to be put
together before any agreement has been reached by the Russian government
with the International Monetary Fund on a standby credit - the normal
pre-condition for such debt rescheduling.
The negotiations are also going ahead without any precise rescheduling
programme of payments being proposed by the Russian government, in another
clear departure from normal Paris Club rules.
Preparatory talks open in Paris today for the full Paris Club meeting on
Thursday and Friday, with indications that both sides are prepared to move
from their previous positions.
Much will depend on a successful outcome to the current bilateral summit in
Moscow between Russia and Germany, by far the biggest creditor nation, and
on reassurances by Russia that its economic reform programme will continue
to be implemented in spite of the current political upheaval.
Hitherto, Russia has called for debts totalling Dollars 16.1bn to be
rescheduled in the agreement, while the Paris Club creditors have offered to
include just Dollars 13.6bn.
According to the Paris Club plan, debt servicing costs in 1993 would be
Dollars 4.6bn, while the Russian side says it can only afford Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister heading the debt
negotiations, has said that if the Paris Club insists on its figures, total
debt servicing costs for his government next year would be more than Dollars
6bn, including commercial debt. He expects to have barely Dollars 3bn
available. The Russian aim is to pay no more than Dollars 5bn for government
and commercial creditors combined, and thus reduce the gap of Dollars 3bn
between debt servicing needs, and available hard currency, to around Dollars
2bn.
That sum would then by financed either by the planned IMF standby credit, or
by drawing on the IMF stabilisation funds.
Germany's position in the negotiations is critical, because it is by far the
largest creditor government.
It is also insisting that the cut-off date for the rescheduling - the date
after which debts are supposed to be paid on time - should be January 1,
1991, and not January 1, 1992 as requested by the Russian government.
If all goes well in the talks between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Boris
Yeltsin overnight, at Mr Yeltsin's country dacha, then the German government
will today express firm support for the rescheduling process, and the aim to
get it completed before the end of the year.
As for the commercial banks, formal negotiations on a long-term rescheduling
have barely begun.
In Frankfurt, on December 4, the co-ordinating committee, which is headed by
Deutsche Bank, agreed on a series of broad principles for such a deal,
without discussing any figures.
Those principles are that any rescheduling should be realistic enough to be
accepted by the markets; that the debt payments agreed must take into
account the economic realities in Russia; and that the commercial banks will
not necessarily agree on an identical deal to the Paris Club  - although
they should not be contradictory, either.
No firm date has been agreed for the next round of talks between the banks
and the Russian government.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Russia - The Future of Reform: Yeltsin refuses to lose faith
in reforms - But it remains to be seen if the new PM will safeguard them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and DMITRI VOLKOV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PIECING together of the events of the past few days shows Russian
President Boris Yeltsin made many mistakes: but one of them has not been to
lose his faith in his reforms. He remains committed to it - though there are
some among the foreign observers who fear he may be too sanguine in thinking
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin will safeguard them.
The Russian president had, in the two weeks of the Congress, appeared
lacklustre and passive. He had made a series of compromises - in sacking Mr
Mikhail Poltoranin, the information minister and a close ally before the
Congress and Mr Gennady Burbulis, his closest aide, last weekend; in
allowing parliament to have the right of veto over the ministers of foreign
affairs, defence, interior and security; and in the direction of the reform
programme itself. In spite of these concessions, the deputies refused to
vote for Mr Yegor Gaidar, his choice as prime minister, last Wednesday -
though by only 18 votes.
Mr Yeltsin's sudden announcement last Thursday that he would hold a
referendum of 'trust' between himself and the Congress, should have been the
beginning of a populist presidential campaign, Yeltsin against the
conservatives, just as it had been before he took over the governance of
Russia. It did not work out so: his appeal for his supporters in the
Congress to follow him was heeded by fewer than 200: pro-Yeltsin
demonstrations were small. Congress kept its quorum and the next day Mr
Yeltsin agreed to negotiations and compromise with Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov,
the parliamentary speaker.
The compromise was to hold a referendum - but on the outlines of a new
constitution, not on a straight choice between Congress and president. It
also gave Congress a 'soft' vote on candidates for the role of prime
minister. Mr Yeltsin would choose from a short list of three and the new
prime minister would be in place if Congress supported his choice. If not,
the president could use special powers to nominate an acting prime minister
for three months.
On Sunday and Monday, the word from presidential and government circles was
that all had been settled - though it was admitted that accidents might
happen.
The Gaidar team, and Mr Gaidar himself, were prepared for a new prime
minister: they had decided they could work either under the direction of Mr
Vladimir Shumeiko, a deputy prime minister and sturdy supporter of Mr
Gaidar: or a new figure, Mr Victor Kadannikov, managing director of the
AvtoVaz car plant, who is head of the new government advisory commission on
industry.
On Monday afternoon, the vote was taken on five candidates of whom Mr
Yeltsin approved: these were Mr Gaidar, Mr Kadannikov, Mr Chernomyrdin, Mr
Shumeiko - and Mr Yuri Skokov, Mr Yeltsin's tough, and conservative, chief
of staff.
The deputies knew all of the candidates except Mr Kadannikov - who arrived
flustered and late to the Congress, having been summoned to Moscow only on
Monday by Mr Yeltsin (he flew from Togliatti, on the Volga, in Mr Yeltsin's
private aircraft).
He was thus given the floor, and made a poor impression: on the floor of
Congress, fiddling with the unfamiliar sound equipment, he said: 'We in
Togliatti approve the reforms in general. There have been mistakes . . . but
I am afraid I have no experience of government . . . I may not make a good
prime minister.'
The deputies then voted: Mr Skokov topped the poll, with 637; Mr
Chernomyrdin was a close second, with 621; Mr Gaidar ran a poor third with
400; Mr Kadannikov came just after him, on 399; and Mr Shumeiko was
decisively last, on 283.
Mr Yeltsin asked for a 40-minute break: huddled with Mr Gaidar, he asked his
prime minister to resign. Mr Gaidar refused, pushing the president to make a
decision. Mr Yeltsin asked him for his preference between Mr Skokov and Mr
Chernomyrdin: Mr Gaidar, certain that Mr Skokov had no interest in reform,
chose his cabinet colleague. Mr Yeltsin went back to the Congress, said he
was still for Mr Gaidar but that Mr Gaidar himself had agreed to Mr
Chernomyrdin becoming prime minister. Mr Gaidar, walking out of the Congress
hall, told waiting reporters he would resign, 'and not come back'.
In the course of these events it has not seemed that Mr Yeltsin has had a
strategy - rather that he played an ad hoc hand, possibly with conflicting
advice. His support for Mr Gaidar appeared the consistent thread - until, at
the very end, when it lay within his power to sustain him in office for a
further three months, he dropped him. He was, say those close to him, weary
and fractious.
It seemed he could not face another bruising battle with a Congress which
would have been outraged that their first and second choices had been passed
over - though both his friends and his enemies expected exactly that choice
to be made.
In so acting, he at first seemed to have lost all: authority, support from
the radicals and the symbol of his reform programme. The explanations of his
aides - that 'Mr Gaidar was, after all, unpopular and Mr Chernomyrdin is
well known to the president, and trusted' seemed like a post hoc
rationalisation. At the same time, however, the dust was rapidly settling in
Moscow.
There were no further resignations from the cabinet and the impression
gained by both the German ministers here with Chancellor Helmut Kohl for
talks and from international finance officials who had talked to deputy
ministers was that most if not all of the 'Gaidar team' would stay.
Mr Chernomyrdin underlined, several times, that he had been an active member
of the reform cabinet and that the reform course would remain.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin yesterday attempted to reassure the west
that his country's reforms remained on course.
Mr Yeltsin, pictured with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who is visiting
Moscow, said he had succeeded in protecting the reforms despite opposition
from the Congress of People's Deputies.

FT  16 DEC 92 / UK blocks funding for Brussels-backed HDTV strategy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday blocked funding for a Brussels-backed strategy to market
high definition television, throwing into doubt the European Commission's
plans to fund the technology.
Eleven member states drafted a statement reaffirming support for HDTV - the
advanced generation of television technology, which is expected greatly to
enhance picture quality - but British opposition to more than Ecu500m
(Pounds 404m) of funding jeopardises the Commission's plans to back HDTV
technol-ogy.
Britain's tough stand drew criticism from the Dutch and French after a
heated meeting of EC industry ministers in Brussels yesterday. Mrs Hadja
May-Weggen, Dutch industry minister, denounced the British position and
suggested that Mr John Major, prime minister, had promised Mr Ruud Lubbers,
his Dutch counterpart, to be supportive when they met at the Edinburgh
summit.
The Dutch and French support the five-year spending plan. Philips of the
Netherlands and Thomson of France have spent millions developing the D2-Mac
and HD-Mac technology and are seeking markets.
The row at yesterday's meeting turned into an EC clash between British
distaste for industrial policy and a Franco-Dutch desire to support national
champions. Britain offered to keep the HDTV programme alive with Ecu80m in
1993 and to review all advanced television technologies, including HDTV
which the UK believes risks becoming outdated.
Dutch officials were incensed that Mr Tim Sainsbury, British industry
minister who chaired the meeting, refused to drop UK opposition. One
official said: 'Because 11 members are in favour, the UK should do the
decent thing and abstain.'
Mr Sainsbury said the UK was concerned that spending proggammes devoted to
the Mac standard rather than advanced digital technologies might saddle the
EC with technology the Asians and North Americas would not be using.
UK officials said several other member states such as Denmark and Ireland
were also uneasy about allowing Brussels to commit large sums to HDTV. 'We
don't want to be led into a technological cul-de-sac,' said a UK official.
Brussels' original plan was to spend Ecu850m over five years. Member states
yesterday scaled back these plans, with bids ranging from Ecu450m to
Ecu600m.
The money would go to consortia for satellite broadcasting, as well as to
producers for converting programmes for use in high definition TV sets.
Money may also go to other widescreen TV services such as Pal Plus, and for
modifying studios making programmes for broadcasting using HDTV technology.
The 11 member states urged that the general affairs council take up the HDTV
issue next Monday.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Higher industry costs fuel inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP RISE in the price of raw materials used by UK industry last month
has fuelled fears that inflationary pressures are building in the economy.
Producer input prices rose a seasonally adjusted 2.4 per cent in November
compared with October, the biggest monthly rise since October 1976. Compared
with November last year, input prices rose 4.1 per cent.
The increase in the price of imported goods was much higher than expected by
the City and may explain why Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has been
reluctant to ease bank base rates below 7 per cent, in spite of demands for
lower rates from members of the panel of independent economists named last
week to advise the Treasury.
A survey of the retail sector from the Confederation of British Industry
also showed that the rising cost of imported goods has yet to affect shop
prices.
In its last distributive trades survey before Christmas, the CBI said retail
sales volumes fell in November from October, although big retailers showed a
stronger performance.
Other Central Statistical Office figures yesterday showed stronger than
expected output growth by manufacturers in October. Production rose by 0.3
per cent on September, buoyed by stronger growth in the chemicals and
electrical engineering sectors.
In the three months to October, manufacturing output fell by 0.2 per cent on
previous three months, although energy production rose 3 per cent during the
same period.
The Treasury said manufacturing output was holding at levels 'well above the
trough', and added that lower unit labour costs would ease some of the
upward pressure on producer prices due to the fall in the exchange rate.
The CSO figures showed that prices of raw materials and fuel rose at their
highest annual rate in November since December 1989. Until September, prices
had fallen almost every month this year.
Producer output prices, which measure the prices of goods leaving the
factory gate, rose 3.3 per cent in the year to November, unchanged from
October, suggesting manufacturers have absorbed higher prices for raw
materials. Excluding volatile food, drink and tobacco prices, the index rose
by 2.4 per cent compared with the same month a year ago, the lowest annual
rate of increase since April 1969.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary, said the figures contrasted with the
more optimistic tone taken recently by the government. 'They show just how
far from recovery this country is, and just how far removed from reality
this cabinet has become,' he said.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Craxi named in Italian corruption probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BETTINO CRAXI, leader of Italy's Socialist party and a former prime
minister, was yesterday informed that he was under investigation by Milan
magistrates, making him the most prominent figure to be caught up in their
widening net of corruption inquiries.
The magistrates served notice on Mr Craxi that he was being investigated for
alleged corruption and illegal financing of the Socialist party. Mr Craxi
issued a statement declaring his innocence and saying the move was designed
to discredit him and his party.
It is the first time in Italy's post-war history that the leader of a main
political party has been so directly linked to charges of alleged
corruption. Mr Craxi has been Socialist leader for 16 years and was prime
minister from 1983 until 1987.
Mr Craxi made it clear he would not step down voluntarily as leader of the
Socialist party, already weakened by poor election results and the
corruption scandal.
In recent weeks there have been rumours that Milan magistrates, who since
February have arrested and charged more than 70 local and national
politicians with alleged corruption, were about to turn their attentions to
Mr Craxi. They were reportedly waiting until after last weekend's elections
in 55 municipalities throughout Italy.
Milan is the centre of Mr Craxi's power base and Mr Paolo Pillitieri, his
brother-in-law, former mayor of the city and Socialist MP, has already been
charged with alleged corruption.
The magistrates' move is a big blow to a party which saw its vote cut to 5
per cent in the pivotal northern industrial cities of Monza and Varese at
the weekend.
On Friday, parliament agreed to waive the immunity of Mr Gianni de Michelis,
the party's deputy leader and former foreign minister, so that Venice
magistrates could investigate alleged corruption charges against him.
Mr Craxi's statement said: 'I believe this initiative by the prosecutor's
office in Milan is wholly without foundation and is no less than an attack
against my person and whose purpose is political rather than that of
justice.'
He went on to say he took full responsibility for the actions of the party.
This suggests Mr Craxi has no intention of stepping down from the party
leadership although one third of the party is in open revolt against him.
The weakening of the party, one of the pillars of the four-party ruling
coalition, is likely to complicate the position of Mr Giuliano Amato, the
Socialist prime minister, although he has recently managed to distance
himself from Mr Craxi.
Yesterday, the lira declined to L895 against the D-Mark in nervous trading
related to the political uncertainty.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (9): New openings to the
north - After 300 years, Poland looks to Scandinavia again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been more than 300 years since Poles were last forced to look hard at
their neighbours on the north shore of the Baltic. That was when the Swedes,
led by King Gustavus Adolphus, invaded and took control of most of Poland in
the 1650s.
In between times, Poles became accustomed to focusing on their neighbours to
the east and the west as potential threats to their country's independence.
This neglect of the north is now changing - very slowly. Mr Andrzej
Arendarski, Poland's foreign trade minister, recently appealed to Swedish
businessmen for 'a new invasion, not with arms this time but with capital
investments.'
Time will show if his appeal will be taken up. The three years since the
fall of communism have failed to produce an explosion of either trade or
inward investment from across the Baltic. Several hundred small and medium
size businesses from Scandinavia have located production operations in
northern Poland, but the capital involved is seldom more than a few hundred
thousand dollars.
Sweden is the main partner, with about 400 Swedish owned or Swedish-Polish
joint ventures, as well as some 150 Danish joint ventures and 45 from
Finland. The best known Finnish partner is the Neste oil corporation. But
Scania, the Swedish truck and van maker, recently opted to assemble its
vehicles at Kapena, a Polish enterprise in Koszalin, close to Gdansk, and
Volvo is also planning to assemble buses at the Jelcz plant, this time in
southern Poland.
Scandinavian investors have not only come up against the usual bureaucratic
barriers, but also against the fact that Poland's attention is still focused
on the European Community and increased access to EC markets. It is Germany,
Poland's neighbour to the west, which has become the country's prime trading
partner. Both Italy and Holland do more business with the Poles than the
Scandinavians.
The absence of a strong lobby in Poland for tighter links with the Baltic
region is the more surprising because contemporary Poland has hundreds of
miles of Baltic coast line stretching from Swinoujscie and Szczecin in the
west to Elblag near Kaliningrad in the east.
The Baltic also provides a living for both private and state owned fishing
fleets - but rising costs of fuel and low catches have played havoc with the
sector in the past three years. The closed sea has been turned into a
significant ecological problem largely because Poland, which has almost 40m
inhabitants, became a serious source of pollution under careless communism.
Air and water pollution emanating from Poland has wreaked havoc on
Scandinavian air quality and is an important factor behind the acid rain
which is affecting lakes and forests.
Part of Poland's foreign debt has been reduced on the understanding that
Warsaw will change industrial practices which endanger the life and health
of people on both sides of the Baltic.
In future, planned motorway and rail communications will make Poland an
increasingly important transit route for Scandinavian trade. Freight and
passenger sea links between Poland's Baltic ports of Gdansk, Gdynia and
Szczecin and southern Sweden as well as Denmark and Finland are already in
place and can easily be expanded. There is also scope for co-operation in
shipbuilding, where Denmark's Burmeister and Wain already maintains strong
ties with Polish yards such as the Paris Commune works in Gdynia.
But overall trade is still relatively small. Poland's two-way trade with
Sweden last year was worth Dollars 612m, followed by Dollars 622m with
Denmark and Dollars 512m with Finland. Increased trade with Sweden is
expected after Poland signs an agreement with the Efta countries similar to
Poland's association treaty with Brussels.
The treaty with Efta also foresees a gradual reduction of tariff and other
trade barriers leading to their elimination in the industrial goods sector
by the end of the century. The agreement has been initialled, but some snags
remain, particularly over bilateral trade in agricultural products with
Finland, which has had a free trade arrangement with Poland since 1976. This
has given the Finns a competitive edge which they are loath to lose.
The Finns would also gain from plans to build the Via Baltica, a highway to
link Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with Poland and points further west and
south.
Studies are also almost complete on the cost of restoring a German built
highway linking what is now the desolate military enclave of Kaliningrad
with Elblag to the south.
These road connections would eventually tie the eastern baltic countries
through Poland with the planned north/south European highway - and help
reintegrate an area whose natural links were cut.
Away to the west, the Poles are hoping to cooperate with Swedes and with the
Danish island of Bornholm to form a 'Euroregion' between the Szczecin region
of Poland and Germany's north eastern territories, to forge links in border
areas. The Germans wanted a bilateral arrangement, but the Poles suggested
that Danes and Swedes come in as a counterweight. Looking further ahead, the
Poles may find that despite any strong tradition of close ties with the
north they, like the three post communist Baltic states, are interested in
drawing Scandinavian countries towards them to modify not only a continuing
Russian influence, but united Germany's economic might as well.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (8): The money rolls in -
Capitalist world offers a helping hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ULTIMATE success of the emerging Baltic region will depend on how fast
the former Soviet countries on its eastern shores can become market
economies.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are beginning to win support from
international financial institutions.
Its scale does not compare with the post-war Marshall Plan, but any help is
better than none.
The most important intervention comes from the Washington-based
International Monetary Fund. This autumn the IMF approved stand-by credit
arrangements for all three Baltic states. Latvia was allotted Dollars 82m
over the next 12 months to back its economic and financial reform programme
drawn up under the IMF's direction.
It aims to liberalise prices and trade; to accelerate privatisation of the
defunct state-owned sector; and to reduce inflation by June next year to a
bearable level.
The IMF realises that this coincides with a sharp contraction of Latvia's
trade with Russia and a rise in the cost of its energy and raw materials.
In Estonia the IMF is providing Dollars 41m of stand-by credits for the next
12 months. Estonia's reform programme has been set specific targets - to
limit the fall in industrial output by July 1993 to 15 per cent; slow the
annual inflation rate to 6 per cent by the end of the period; and raise
gross foreign reserves by mid-1993 to a level equivalent to more than two
months of imports.
Estonia's adoption in July of the convertible kroon as its sole currency
suggests that it stands a better chance of progress towards a free market
economy than its Baltic neighbours.
Lithuania has been awarded Dollars 82m worth of IMF stand-by credits - the
decision was confirmed only days before the election of the former
Communists back to power. The IMF aim in Lithuania is to reduce inflation to
2 per cent by next July and keep the fall in real GDP to about 22 per cent
for the 12 month period.
The World Bank is also providing loans and credit guarantees to finance
urgently needed imports and technical help. This autumn it earmarked Dollars
30m for Estonia, with Lithuania and Latvia getting Dollars 60m and Dollars
45m respectively.
In Estonia Dollars 29m will fund imports for the energy, agriculture,
transport and health sectors (Dollars 7m will cover imported drugs, vaccines
and other medical goods). A large part of Latvia's loan will help assure
heating and electricity this winter with the help of imported fuel oil.
Lithuania's loan will also support energy and medical services and pay for
imported feed grain, protein meal, packaging and chemicals for the dairy
industry.
All three World Bank loans are expected to be co-financed by the
Export-Import Bank of Japan to an amount yet to be determined out of the
total World Bank package for the Baltic. Sweden is also providing aid to
Latvia and Lithuania while Finland is providing a grant to help train local
experts to carry out the technical work involved in administering these
loans.
This is only the start of the World Bank's involvement in the Baltic. It
will soon open an office in Riga to co-ordinate its activities in the
region.
It intends to provide a safety net to ease the social pains of economic
transition; build up a core of mamagement to run a market based economy; and
promote medium-term investments to improve efficiency and protect the
environment, particularly in the energy sector.
In October the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
agreed to invest Ecu1.5m in the Estonian Investment Bank. This represents a
third of the Estonian bank's capital.
This is the first equity investment made by the EBRD anywhere in central and
eastern Europe. Similar developments can be expected in the other two Baltic
states.
The EBRD has also approved a number of technical cooperation projects in the
Baltic states. These are mainly concerned with preparing plans for the
long-term restructuring of the energy sector.
A total of Ecu1.8m has been allocated for this purpose in Estonia with
Ecu1.7m for a similar project in Lithuania and Ecu1.5m in Latvia. But
consultants have to be selected for these plans.
The European Community itself is also involved in providing direct financial
assistance. This year Estonia received Ecu10m under the Community's Phare
programme to help in privatisation, private sector development and financial
reform, social securtity and gathering statistics. Supplies of wheat for
making bread, barley, wheat flour and sugar have also been sold with the
proceeds going into social welfare provision.
Emergency investment is also being considered. A total of Ecu43.4m would
help to repair Estonia's energy supply and reduce emissions from power
stations and district heating plalnts, finance emergency oil import
facilities and reduce demands for oil and gas. Similar programmes in Latvia
and Lithuania are to receive Ecu37.060m and Ecu 43.100m respectively.
In March, the Nordic countries agreed to create a Baltic Investment
Programme with Ecu75m to develop the private sector in the Baltic states
initially over the next three years. The strategy will be monitored by a
Nordic Baltic investment committee.
The Helsinki-based Nordic Investment Bank is also playing an active role in
financing projects in the Baltic states. Last month it granted its first
loan worth Ecu4.5m to Estonia to help develop small and medium-sized
enterprises. The funds are being channelled through the recently established
Estonian Investment Bank in Tallinn which will be responsible for the
allocation of those funds.
This first Baltic Investment Loan was granted within the framework of a new
Ecu30m loan facility entrusted to the NIB to administer with the Nordic
countries fully guaranteeing the loans. Mr Ulf Hindstrom, the NIB's vice
president, claims there is already a great deal of interest with 60 projects
already in the pipeline.
The NIB has been entrusted with a Ecu5m three-year fund for technical aid to
the investment banks in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. This will provide
support for management and institutional activities
The Helsinki based Nordic Project Fund - established in 1982 to help Nordic
private companies in international activities - is also backing studies in
the Baltic countries through an Ecu5m fund for technical assistance. This
fund is to be administered by the EBRD and no project must exceed FIM700,000
with conditional interest-free loans covering 60 per cent of the cost.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (10): Well-placed to gain
 -The port of Rostock recalls its historic role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSTOCK is shaking off 50 years of central planning and staking a claim to
become Germany's commercial gateway to the Baltic region.
The ancient Hansa trading city appears well-placed for the role. Rostock is
strategically located midway across the German Baltic seacoast, astride the
main north-south transport route between Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin and
Prague. Much to the chagrin of local leaders, however, Rostock's reputation
was badly dented last August when young rightwing extremists attacked
asylum-seekers in the city. Most Rostockers are now ashamed of what
happened, but the damage was done.
Shortly after the second world war, Rostock port was built into the then
East Germany's main harbour. By 1989 it employed 6,000 people and handled
20m tons of goods. Young people from all over the country were lured to the
city by relatively high wages in the harbour and adjacent shipyards. But in
1991, the first full year of German unity, cargo turnover plummeted to 6m
tonnes as Rostock lost its function as an overseas port not only for East
Germany but for Czechoslovakia and Hungary as well. Hamburg and Bremerhaven
were far better suited to handle this international traffic. Rostock turned
to its traditional sphere of influence, the Baltic region. New shipping
terminals and ferry links to Denmark were inaugurated. More than 80
companies set up shop in the harbour area and by the end of this year the
port expects to handle 10m tons of cargo. Two hundred thousand tons of this
is military hardware being shipped back to Russia by the CIS army in east
Germany.
A recent study says that Rostock harbour could regain its 1989 volume by
1996. Much will depend on the overall economic situation in Germany and the
rest of Europe. A malting plant owned by a French company in the harbour
area is doubling capacity to 160,000 tonnes next year and intends to export
brewing barley grown in the region. A new coal-fired electric power station
in Rostock is to import all its coal through the harbour.
Rostock harbour, employing 800 dockers plus a pool of 400 part-timers, is in
fact one of the brighter economic spots in an otherwise gloomy economic
picture for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the most rural east German state. Nearly
75,000 people will leave the state this year for west Germany, and only
30,000 people will settle here. Most seriously, many qualified young workers
are leaving. Unemployment in Rostock and the state is nearly 14.7 per cent,
but is understated by the fact that many workers have been given early
retirement while others are employed in job-creation and retraining schemes.
But Mr Wiglef Purschel, head of the economic section of the chamber of
industry and commerce (IHK) in Rostock, sees hopeful signs in the interest
being shown by southern German and Austrian companies in Rostock for
trans-shipping their goods to Scandinavia. He foresees that in the longer
term Rostock will play an important role in the economic future of Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia, as their shortest trade route to continental Europe
runs through Rostock.
Rostock also stands to gain from Poland's westward economic integration, as
well as from the planned east-west autobahn across east Germany to Lubeck in
the west. Poland, of course, has its own nearby Baltic harbour of Szczecin
(formerly Stettin, which served Berlin), which competes with Rostock. But Mr
Purschel says that Szczecin's severe infra-structure and administration
problems, along with long delays for trucks at the Polish-German border,
hamper the region's development. Similarly, cross-border economic
co-operation between Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Poland is proving difficult
to implement. Decision-making in Poland remains highly centralised, and
Szczecin is a long way from Warsaw. The construction industry was to have
been the main engine pulling Rostock and the entire region out of its
economic misery, but so far private building has been less active than
expected. As elsewhere in east Germany, contested property claims are the
main barrier, followed by administrative delays in approving building
projects.
The Rostock area's main shipyard, Warnowwerft in nearby Warnemunde, was
recently sold to Kvaerner of Norway, but the smaller Neptun yard in Rostock
remains to be privatised. Only a fraction of the 58,000 people who were
employed in east German shipbuilding still work in the industry today and 15
ships ordered by the former Soviet Union still remain undelivered and moored
at the yards.
Predictably, Scandinavian companies have been the main foreign investors in
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. One of them, Scanbeton, subsidiary of a Swedish
company, has built four cement plants in the Rostock-Stralsund area at a
cost of DM15m. While praising the teamwork of Swedes and Rostockers, Mr
Peter Michael, the managing director, blames administrative red tape for
holding up the the long-awaited building boom in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern as
well as the rest of eastern Germany.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (5): Eggshell policies -
Relations with Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS, you will be told in the Baltic states of the former Soviet Union,
no such thing as 'Russo-Baltic relations'. Rather there are relations
between three sovereign states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - and a
fourth, Russia.
This touchiness reflects two things. First, it demonstrates a desire not to
be herded together into one post-Soviet lump of indistinguishably similar
little countries - a reasonable desire, because these are countries (for all
the forced homogeneity of the Soviet period) which are quite dissimilar in
language, culture and society, though more similar in economic structure.
Second, it reflects a demand to be treated separately by Russia (although
all three will invoke Baltic solidarity if it benefits them).
In the past year, the relationships would seem to have sharply declined.
President Boris Yeltsin was among the first - even before he became
president - to speak for their right to be independent: when Mr Mikhail
Gorbachev sent in the special troops in January 1991, Mr Yeltsin went so far
as to appeal to the Russians in these detachments to refuse to obey orders.
His victory in August 1991 over the would-be putschists was seen as
cementing the independence of these three small and vulnerable republics:
his desire to democratise his society and lead it to the market was seen as
consonant with theirs.
Not everything has changed, but much has - although the appearance is worse
than the reality, and each case is different.
It is certainly the case that none of the leaders now care to pass
compliments to and fro on each other's democratic ways: the public
pronouncements are now often grudging, even bitter, as the Baltic states
accuse Russia of delaying the pull-out of its troops from their countries,
and Russia countercharges with accusations that the human rights of ethnic
Russians living in the Baltics are being breached.
The best relations, ironically, are with Lithuania; ironical, because the
leader for the past two years has been Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, by far the
most radical of the Baltic heads of state, a former dissident who professed
a constant - and overtly expressed - distrust of Russia.
But the better relationship sprang not from Mr Landsbergis's character, but
from the fact that Lithuania did not fear 'swamping' by its ethnic Russian
population. The Russians account for only 7-8 per cent of the 3.7m people in
the country: the Poles, who are actually seen as a bigger problem because
they are more militant in insisting on their rights and have a political
party of their own, make up 6-7 per cent.
The Lithuanians, over 80 per cent of the population, have in the past been
accustomed to welcoming Russians to their country as refugees from political
persecution. Even in the Soviet period, since the war, relatively few
Russians were settled in the country.
Estonia is different: the Estonian-Russians make up some 35 per cent of the
tiny, 1.6m strong population - a majority in Tallinn, the capital, and over
90 per cent in Narva in the north east. In the elections for the parliament
earlier this year, most Russians were disenfranchised under a law which
awarded citizenship (and hence the voting right) to those who were citizens,
or descendants of citizens, of the independent republic which was annexed to
the USSR in 1940. This dramatic distancing of hundreds of thousands of
people from the state in which they lived raised the ire of the Russians in
Russia; and relations became very tense - with a few shooting incidents in
which lives were lost.
Under the presidency of Mr Lennart Meri and his 'Fatherland' coalition which
governs Estonia, there has been some mending of fences, and talks broken off
have started again. The Estonian government has said that the registration
of Russians as citizens will be made easier by lowering the standards in the
language test, and other measures; while the Russians are often unhappy,
especially in Narva, so far they are largely staying and do not seem
rebellious.
It is in Latvia, where the Russian-speaking population is about 45 per cent,
that relations are worst. This is a country where all the towns, especially
Riga, the capital, are dominated by Russian speakers; where the large
numbers of heavy industrial plants owe their continued (now precarious)
existence to Russian and Ukrainian orders; and where mutual distrust is
highest.
There is as yet no citizenship law, but the indications are that it too will
exempt Russian speakers from effective citizenship. Russian politicians,
goaded by their nationalists, have been constrained to respond. Late in
October, President Yeltsin threatened to stop the troop pull-out; in
November, he wrote to Dr Boutros-Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to
complain of 'mass violations of human rights' and to ask for an
investigation.
In fact, policy on neither side is that simple. The troop pull-out has never
 -so it is said by the Russian foreign ministry - been halted, and is not
conditional on the observance of human rights. Estonia certainly, and Latvia
probably, will tone down their anti-Russian rhetoric and actions, not least
because they face popular discontent arising out of recession, gripping all
of their states; they do not want to irritate large sections of their
inhabitants even more.
Furthermore, most of the Russians appear, at present at least, to be
resigned to becoming Latvians or Estonians. Attendance at language classes
is growing rapidly and the young, especially, express a preference for
staying.
There is no question that the relationships will remain tense: the
post-Soviet Baltics have painful memories of Russian occupation, and these
remain fresh in the minds of the middle aged and elderly. They know well
that an authoritarian turn on Moscow could damage them still. So far - on
eggshells - they are avoiding confrontation.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (6): Catastrophic legacy -
Polluted air and waters are a common challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLEANING up the pollution in the Baltic Sea is an issue on which there is a
common concern among all the countries along its shoreline.
Northern Europe's sea and air are endangered mainly because of long-term
environmental neglect displayed by industry and the public authorities in
the Soviet Union, Poland and East Germany from the end of the 1940s.
The Baltic is naturally vulnerable to pollution since it is the largest
brackish water basin in the world with only a slow and irregular saltwater
exchange from the North Sea via the narrow, shallow straits through Denmark.
As a result its salinity is too high for most freshwater organisms but too
low for the majority of salt water species.
Natural problems have been worsened by decades of inadequate sewage
treatment in the eastern Baltic countries whose rivers discharge untreated
human and animal effluent into the sea.
There are a number of particularly severe pollution areas. In north eastern
Estonia oil shale mining has left a legacy of pollution around the towns of
Kohtla-Jarva with an estimated 350m of untreated water pumped out of the
mines annually.
The large scale industrial areas around St Petersburg, Upper Silesia in
Poland and Ostrava in the Czech lands have also been major sources of air
and water pollution.
The Gulf of Riga, once an unspoilt beauty spot, has 160m tonnes of untreated
waste water pumped into it every year while Kaunas in Lithuania has no
sewage purification facilities.
Poland is the worst polluter of the Baltic through the rivers Vistula and
Oder.
Joint efforts to deal with the Baltic's environment started in 1974 when a
general agreement was signed on protection of the marine enivronment.
But it was not until 1988 that the riparian states signed a convention in
Helsinki committing them to halve the total effluent discharge into the sea.
Earlier this year came the launch of the Baltic Environmental Action
Programme in Helsinki. This estimates it would cost Ecu18bn over the next 20
years to clean up the area.
Poland, as the worst single polluter, has 40 'hot spots' which need
expenditure of at least Ecu4bn. A further Ecu30bn will be needed for
feasibility studies for the highest priority projects.
'There is a plan but so far there is no money', says Mr Rune Ericsson of
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group.
Some support is expected from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the Nordic Investment Bank as well as the World Bank but
ordinary loans will be difficult to obtain because of the Baltic countries'
poor credit rating.
There is special concern in the Baltic area about nuclear contamination from
the power stations of the former Soviet Union.
Ensuring the safety of the Soviet built light-water gas cooled nuclear
reactors at Sosnovy Bor just outside St Petersburg and Ingalina in Lithuania
is of vital importance for the whole region.
Both these plants arouse widespread concern. In March there was a radiation
leak at Sosnovy Bor; in September there was a leak at Ingalina.
Ever since the Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine in 1986 northern Europe has
been sensitive to the dangers of nuclear fall-out from the east and both
Sosnovy Bor and Ingalina are Chernobyl type reactors.
During the 1980s, the anti-nuclear movement grew strongly in the Nordic
countries and although Sweden has put off plans to phase out its own more
secure nuclear plants by 2010, there remains considerable doubt about the
long-term use of nuclear power as an energy resource in northern Europe.
This autumn members of the Finnish Parliament voted unexpectedly for a
motion that ruled out any expansion in nuclear power in Finland despite the
demands from Finnish industry for construction of a fifth nuclear plant.
Finland is also concerned about the Russian pressurised water reactors on
the Kola peninsula in the far north close to its border.
Nordic governments would like the Soviet reactors on the fringes of the
Baltic to be closed as soon as possible. But that seems unlikely because of
the lack of cheap sources of alternative energy in Russia and Lithuania.
A group of senior Nordic politicians called last week for the investment of
SKr600m to improve the safety of Sosnovy Bor and Ingalina. But Sweden's
environment minister, Mr Olof Johansson, says it will require a much wider
European commitment than that of the Nordic countries to deal with a
situation which could potentially threaten the whole area. Last year, the
European Community earmarked about Ecu50m to improve nuclear safety in the
former Soviet Union.
Moves to improve rather than shut down the eastern nuclear plants would help
to provide much-needed work for western construction and maintenance
companies and ensure access in the east to the more superior nuclear
technology available in the market economies around the Baltic.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (7): Harsh fortress for
defence - Kaliningrad, formerly Koenigsberg, remains a special case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALININGRAD, currently an isolated Russian enclave of 900,000 people cut off
from the rest of the Russian Federation by Polish and Lithuanian territory,
bears eloquent witness to the changing fate of nations around the shores of
the Baltic.
It was better known for centuries as Koenigsberg, a rich and cultured port
city which served the orderly agricultural hinterland of eastern Prussia
when the southern Baltic was to all intents and purposes a Prussian lake.
That Germanic dominance of the southern shores of the Baltic began in the
12th century with the Drang nach Osten of the teutonic knights, and
culminated in the various partitions which wiped Poland from the European
map for 150 years.
It ended in misery as the defeated Nazi armies and millions of refugees
streamed westward before the Red Army steamroller, while Nazi generals on
Hitler's orders staged desperate and ultimately hopeless rear-guard
defensive actions by turning Koenigsberg and Danzig into defensive
fortresses. For weeks the city centre was pounded by British bombers as
Soviet troops encircled it.
To this day, however, the Prussian influence can be seen in many villages,
towns, and cities, in avenues of well-made cobbled roads, sturdy barns and
great monuments like the teutonic castle at Malborg. Traces also remain of
Hitler's unfinished autobahn, planned to run the length of the southern
Baltic to connect Berlin with Koenigsberg.
But Koenigsberg and Danzig, where the second world war began and ended, were
physically destroyed by weeks of heavy fighting. Danzig, whose Prussian,
Polish and indigenous Kashub inhabitants created a unique micro-culture
immortalised in The Tin Drum and other novels by Gunther Grass, was lovingly
rebuilt and reborn as Gdansk. A less fortunate fate befell Koenigsberg, the
birthplace of Immanuel Kant, the philosopher of pure reason.
When the war ended, Stalin redrew the map of central Europe. He moved the
Polish borders westward over 200kms to include most of former Prussia and
Pomerania, while much of pre-war Polish territory to the east was tagged on
to Soviet-controlled Lithuania, Belorussia and Ukraine. Millions of Poles
from these areas of pre-war eastern Poland now live in the western provinces
carved from the Nazi German Reich.
Koenigsberg was renamed in honour of Mikhail Kalinin, a Bolshevik nonentity
whom Stalin made the nominal Soviet head of state. Together with a
surrounding swathe of former east Prussian territory the city was placed
under Moscow's direct control.
For the duration of the cold war Kaliningrad was a closed military district,
home to a powerful Baltic fleet and a crucial trans-shipment and supply
point for crack Soviet forces in former East Germany.
Kant's grave is one of few monuments or traces of the long Prussian sojourn
left in a city virtually flattened by war and re-built in the numbingly ugly
Soviet way. Ironically, his memory - and that of the Prussian past - is
treasured by many of Kaliningrad's contemporary Russian and former-Soviet
inhabitants searching desperately for a new identity and purpose in the
post-Soviet world.
Much of present day Kaliningrad is ugly and harsh. For months ships and
trains have been disgorging arms and men, the detritus of a Soviet army
withdrawing from its post-war frontline positions in Germany and from
Poland.
Unwanted, and often uncared for, the combination of a demoralised soldiery
and masses of lightly guarded equipment and ammunition, has made Kaliningrad
a mecca for arms traders from former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and other
actual or potential hotspots around the globe. The presence of so many
weapons and so many soldiers - up to 300,000 according to some accounts - is
extremely unsettling, especially to neighbouring Poland and Lithuania, whose
governments want both removed or sharply reduced, as soon as possible.
As for its long term survival, local politicians are talking about their
region acquiring autonomy within the Russian federation and forging a
special relationship with Germany which would allow the descendants of the
former Baltic Germans to return, as investors, tourists and even settlers to
the city they once made great.
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, meanwhile backs plans to turn the
15,000 square km Kaliningrad region into a free economic zone in the hope,
as yet distant, of allowing it to develop a 21st century future as the Hong
Kong of the Baltic. The general aim would be the creation of a trading and
manufacturing hub for the enormous former Soviet hinterland, which would
enjoy free access to materials, capital and markets to both east and west.
The Lithuanian government has already guaranteed free road and rail access
to the enclave. The Russian authorities are trying to interest potential
Japanese, Chinese and Korean investment to turn Kaliningrad into the western
terminal of a new transcontinental link-up with Nakhodka, the planned free
zone near Vladivostok on the Pacific.
For such plans to prosper, however, Kaliningrad has to be re-integrated into
the region through improved road, rail and sea links, including the
completion of Hitler's unfinished autobahn to Berlin, and the Via Baltica
linking Scandinavia with St Petersburg.
All this seems far into the future. But it is not entirely fanciful to
imagine the re-emergence of a prosperous Baltic with Kaliningrad (probably
renamed) as its eastern fulcrum, early in the next century.

FT  16 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow resists pressure as IBM
shares drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were flat-to-lower yesterday in the wake of some more bad
news from IBM, one of the market's biggest stocks, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down only 7.84 at
3,284.36, having spent the entire day a few points below opening values. Had
it not been for the big loss in IBM the Dow would have ended in positive
territory. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also held up well,
ending just 0.27 off at 432.57.
Secondary markets displayed less resilience, with the Nasdaq composite,
which has put in the best performance in recent months, giving up 3.98 at
650.75. Turnover on the New York SE was busy at 228m shares, and falls
outpaced rises by 947 to 836.
The day's only economic news, a 0.3 per cent decline in November business
inventories, came in as expected and had little effect. This left investors
to focus on technical and corporate factors.
The technical factor that dominated was the reluctance among some investors
to trade heavily ahead of Friday's 'triple-witching' expiration of stock and
stock-index futures and options, an occasion which typically creates
considerable turbulence in the underlying cash equity markets.
The main corporate news of the day shook the market. IBM, traditionally the
bellwether stock among US blue chip companies, announced that it would cut
25,000 jobs in 1993 and take a Dollars 6bn charge in the current quarter.
Although investors have long been aware of IBM's problems, and there was
weakness in the shares last week, this latest bout of restructuring and
downsizing cast a cloud over market sentiment, which has lately been
relatively sunny.
IBM shares reacted to the news by dropping sharply. By the close the stock
was trading at Dollars 56 1/8 , down Dollars 6 3/4 , after turnover of 12.2m
shares.
Other large technology issues were dragged lower. Compaq gave up Dollars
3/4 at Dollars 42 1/4 , Digital Equipment Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 33 and
Motorola Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 100 1/4 .
The other big corporate news came from Boeing, which was expected yesterday
to win about two-thirds of an order of more than Dollars 4bn for new jet
aircraft from International Lease Finance. The good news about the order
helped offset Monday's disappointing news that UAL, owner of United
Airlines, was in talks with Boeing to reduce significantly its capital
spending plans for new aircraft. In strong two-way trade Boeing finished
Dollars  1/4 up at Dollars 34 3/4 .
Motor shares were all notably weaker as the latest set of car sales figures
began to stream in. Chrysler receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 5/8 , Ford
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 and General Motors Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 32
1/2 amid growing concern among investors that the recent upturn in consumer
sentiment has not fed through into higher auto sales.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended mixed after a day of brisk tax-loss selling and warrant
redemptions. The TSE 300 index edged up 2.6 to 3,264.6 but declines
outnumbered advances by 380 to 275, with 323 issues unchanged. Volume was
boosted by several block trades and jumped to 52.7m shares valued at
CDollars 424.1m. The gold and silver shares index strengthened 39.8 to
5,147.1.
TransCanada Pipeline firmed CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 17 1/2 on heavy volume
of 7.3m shares due to yesterday's expiry of 37.5m TransCanada share purchase
warr-ants issued in 1990 by BCE.

FT  16 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Petrofina dividend cut drags
Brussels down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RSES reflected a mixture of moods and stimuli, writes Our Markets Staff.
BRUSSELS concentrated on Petrofina following the oil group's announcement
after the market closed on Monday that it would cut its 1992 dividend by 50
per cent. The Bel-20 index lost 11.52 to 1,101.13 as Petrofina closed down
BFr500, or 6.2 per cent at BFr7,490 but off the day's low of BFr7,260. The
group warned that 1992 profits will be depressed and the forecast came at
the lower end of analysts' expectations.
Petrofina's major shareholder, Electrafina, fell BFr120 to BFr2,070 and GBL,
which controls Electrafina, lost BFr70 at BFr2,620.
MILAN fell again. Following the rebuff delivered to ruling parties in local
elections on Sunday and Monday, there was news that Mr Bettino Craxi, leader
of the Italian socialist party and a former prime minister, had been
officially notified by Milan magistrates that he was being investigated as
part of a continuing probe into city hall corruption.
After a 2.2 per cent fall on Monday the Comit index dropped another 9.27, or
2.2 per cent again, to 404.25. Mediobanca fell L710, or 5.9 per cent to
L11,290 and Fiat by L225, or 5.8 per cent to L3,675 although, in line with
the market, the carmaker recovered L80 to L3,755 on the kerb.
Monday's main losers, the banking privatisation candidates, did not emerge
unscathed yesterday. BCI fell L149 to L4,001 and Credito Italiano by L44 to
L2,601. Among other privatisation stocks, Finmeccanica was amongst the
hardest hit, shedding over 9 per cent to close at L1,070.
PARIS was in a positive mood although late profit-taking eroded some of the
day's gains. The CAC-40 index closed 6.53 ahead at 1,744.79, having seen an
intraday high of 1,752.10. Turnover was estimated at some FFr2bn.
Accor improved well after forecasting a 15 per cent increase in group profit
in 1993 and the shares rose FFr12 to FFr613. There was also strong activity
among financials with some program buying noted. UAP gained FFr9.30 to
FFr426.30, Paribas put on FFr9.80 to FFr338.80 and Societe Generale advanced
FFr13 to FFr573.
Total continued to lose ground following Monday's profits warning, falling a
further FFr2.30 to FFr225.00 as Elf recovered FFr2.40 to FFr325.70.
Eurotunnel was just 25 centimes down on the day at FFr28.50 after
TransManche Link said that talks between the two sides regarding cost
overruns had reached a standstill.
FRANKFURT reacted after five straight days of losses, the DAX index ending
11.49 higher at 1,481.24, as dealers talked of short covering ahead of
Friday's closure of DTB options and futures contracts. Volume stayed low at
DM3.7bn, up from DM3.1bn. The insurance company, Allianz, closed DM24 higher
at DM1,860, reflecting its attractions to DTB traders. In the car sector BMW
rose DM5 to DM470, Daimler DM6.30 to DM513 and Volkswagen DM3.50 to
DM244.50.
Elsewhere, the steel group Thyssen and Veba, the utility, rose DM2.80 to
DM155.50 and DM2.60 to DM348.60 after government sources said that their
consortium was expected to win approval to operate the new E-1 mobile phone
network.
ZURICH continued to assert its independence of the Frankfurt bourse, the SMI
index losing 10.2 to to 2,005.1.
AMSTERDAM retreated in low turnover as the CBS Tendency index closed 0.5
weaker at 103.5. ING was among the gainers, up 60 cents at Fl 53.00.
STOCKHOLM was pulled lower by Astra and Volvo as the Affarsvarlden index
lost 9.6 to 879.1 in turnover of some SKr605m.
Astra, down SKr9 at SKr732, weakened after an analysts meeting on Monday
while Volvo B shares lost SKr3 to SKr332 after Moody's downgraded the
group's commercial paper ratings.
ISTANBUL gained some 2 per cent on rumours that the government was to
approve new tax legislation affecting equity holdings. The 75-share index
rose 78.49 to 3,901.94 in turnover of TL258.7bn.

REVIVED hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate spurred late
afternoon buying, and the Nikkei average rose moderately on futures linked
demand and purchases by pension funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 190.77 at 17,480.74 after a low of 17,220.56
and high of 17,554.86. The index remained sluggish through most of the day,
but rose in the last few minutes of trading, recovering to 17,500, the
200-day moving average. But once again it failed to close over this
technical resistance level as last-minute profit-taking depressed share
prices.
Volume rose slightly to 200m shares from 150m. Arbitrageurs and public funds
were the only prominent participants. Advances led declines by 564 to 382,
with 181 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose
9.55 to 1,325.90, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.43 to
1,074.09.
Market participants were encouraged by rumours of a cut in the discount rate
after the afternoon release of weak machinery orders for October. Private
machinery orders fell 28.6 per cent from the previous month, reflecting a
continuing slump in the economy. The announcement by the Osaka stock
exchange that the Ministry of Finance was considering the implementation of
a circuit breaker mechanism for the Nikkei futures index, traded in Osaka,
also aided sentiment.
Hitachi Electronics, a broadcasting equipment maker affiliated to Hitachi,
put on Y180 to Y1,380 on hopes of a US economic recovery and firm current
year earnings. Sumitomo Chemical climbed Y19 to Y479 on reports that
Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, its unlisted subsidiary, will double current year
pre-tax profits on sales of its interferon drug.
Yokohama Matsuzakaya, a department store, rose by its daily limit of Y80 to
Y540 on rumours of a merger with another leading retailer. Oji Paper added
Y7 at Y863 and Kanzaki Paper Y19 at Y653, also on merger rumours.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 31.98 to 18,894.40 in volume of 21.1m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y100 to Y11,100 on buying by
investors encouraged by its firm earnings prospects. Roundup
WITH the exception of Hong Kong the region's markets were weaker yesterday.
HONG KONG rose in low turnover, with comments by President-elect Bill
Clinton, that China might keep its Most Favoured Nation trading status with
the US if it made progress in human rights, helping to boost sentiment. The
Hang Seng index gained 48.08 at 5,315.81 in turnover of HKDollars 2bn. HSBC
rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 55.50.
SEOUL saw profit-taking as investors remained nervous ahead of this Friday's
presidential elections. Interest remained in Kepco, the electricity
generator, which rose Won300 to Won21,100. The composite index lost 1.02 to
650.21 in turnover of Won382.4bn.
MANILA fell afresh following the overnight drop of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone in New York. The composite index shed 19.07 to 1,183.49 as PLDT
declined 40 pesos to 810 pesos. Combined turnover rose to 310m pesos from
Monday's 197m.
TAIWAN lost further ground ahead of Saturday's parliamentary elections, the
weighted index slipping 8.50 to 3,688.26 in turnover of TDollars 7.2bn.
KUALA LUMPUR eased, with some speculative stocks continuing to fall on
profit-taking. The composite index lost 3.66 to 628.88. Multi-Purpose
Holdings dipped a further 6 cents to MDollars 2.19 as there was still no
news on its application for a gaming licence in south China. SINGAPORE's
Straits Times Industrial index fell 12.00 to 1,442.10 in volume of 72.6m
shares.
AUSTRALIA weakened on profit-taking, with industrial issues suffering the
day's worst falls. The All Ordinaries index closed 2.9 lower at 1,509.6 in
turnover of ADollars 284.8m. Mining stocks helped to support the market,
with Western Mining rising 7 cents to ADollars 4.38.
NEW ZEALAND was led lower by a steep fall in Fletcher Challenge of 9 cents
to NZDollars 2.26 as investors were unimpressed by news that it was to merge
its Canadian forest operations. The NZSE-40 index shed 11.12 to 1,520.98.
Telecom fell 4 cents to NZDollars 2.30 after stating that it would be
cutting some of its tariffs.

FT  16 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Madrid buoyed by a mood of optimism -
After months in the doldrums equities are enjoying a year-end rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish have ways to make a market talk. Brow beaten for months by
government deficit overruns, tax increases, a Moody's debt rating review,
two peseta devaluations, rising unemployment and falling growth, the Madrid
market has suddenly been energised by a financial community desperate to end
the year as little out of pocket as possible.
The Madrid general index may still be down 13 per cent on the year, but in
the last few weeks it has come bounding back from the low 180s reached
during the autumn currency crisis to finish at 215.31 yesterday.
Everyone is winning. Bank shares have risen most sharply, with the sectoral
index advancing from 230.6 on October 2 to 272 on Monday. Likewise,
electricity utilities have recovered by 40 to 213, and chemicals were up 35
points to 218. Even the battered construction sector had managed to creep up
8 to 288.
Construction was in trouble long before the equity market. The government
owes builders about Dollars 8bn, the release of which it is delaying in
order to dress up its 1992 fiscal performance. Madrid is also delaying
contract awards, which will affect construction companies' 1993 figures. But
the banks, the engine room of the Spanish economy, have bounced back in
spite of the fact that they face record bad debts this year and next, as
economic growth fades to a trickle.
The sector, however, has had some help. The Bank of Spain allowed banks,
faced with potentially huge portfolio losses on government debt as the bond
market fell in the autumn, to defer the effects and thus save their profit
and loss accounts. Last week, the central bank cut its reserve requirement
from 4.5 per cent to 3 per cent, which freed some Dollars 6bn of deposits
previously trapped, interest free, with the authority.
The utilities are back in spite of the fact that many are heavily indebted
in foreign currencies and will have been hurt by the peseta's two recent
devaluations. This is partly because the government has decided on big
electricity tariff increases for domestic users next year and also hopes of
an early fall in interest rates.
But is there good reason for that optimism? Possibly. Inflation will end the
year under 5.5 per cent, well below the feared 6.5 per cent. All indirect
tax increases planned for next year have been implemented this year. The
central budget deficits, running nearly 70 per cent over target in the
summer, are now under control and will end the year on target. Moody's,
having shaken Madrid in October by announcing a review of Spain's debt
rating, has just decided not to touch it.
There are sceptics. 'Quite a lot of people would like the year to end more
happily,' says Mr Paul Farrow of brokers FG in Madrid. 'So we find they are
suddenly being a lot more positive about things they were recently being
negative about despite the fact that nothing has really changed.'
FG is not, in spite of the festive mood, changing its growth forecast of 0.5
per cent for next year and is advising clients to sell if the general index
reaches 220. And with polls showing that the election Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez has to hold by next October will most likely force him into a
minority or a coalition government, with quite unknowable consequences,
investors are going to tread lightly around Madrid.
That is evident even in the current boomlet. The Ibex 35 index, which covers
the largest companies in the market, has risen by about 20 per cent since
early October, outstripping the 15 per cent recovery in the general index.
It means investors may simply be buying back into cheap, traditionally
liquid stock such as banks and utilities.
Analysts do not think the reserve requirement cut for banks will feed
through quickly into profits. In the current climate, it might not feed
through at all. 'It may mean the banks have more money to lend,' says
another broker. 'But given the bad debt provisions they're already having to
make they're probably better off being starved of money if they're going to
lend it badly. We'll see. The reserve cut will only make a difference if
they lend the new money well.'
Given the current cheer in the market, not everyone in Madrid is as wary or
exhausted as the last speaker. But Spain always deals with bad news by
ignoring it and that has to be worth a few more points on the general index.

FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: FCL to merge Canadian pulp,
paper units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge, the international forest products, energy and
construction group based in New Zealand, is merging its two Canadian pulp
and paper units in a deal which is valued at nearly CDollars 900m (USDollars
750m).
The result will be a net CDollars 177m cash transfer from the enlarged
Canadian company to the parent in New Zealand.
FCL will continue to hold 72 per cent of the enlarged Fletcher Challenge
Canada, which will have annual sales of more than CDollars 1.5bn and rank
among the top four Canadian integrated forest products companies.
Total capacity will be about 1.4m tonnes of newsprint and coated papers and
400,000 tonnes of pulp annually.
The timber side is profitable now, but the pulp and paper operations
continue near break-even pending recovery in North American market prices.
FCC officials in Vancouver said that the merged company would have sales
potential of far more than CDollars 2bn a year once North American prices
returned to normal.
The new company will include a new quoted paper mill in the US.
The merger is proposed in three steps and will be put before FCC
shareholders in January.
FCC buys the assets of Crown Forest Industries, a Vancouver Island pulp and
paper and timber producer from the New Zealand parent for CDollars 897m. FCC
has been managing Crown Forest for the parent on a fee basis since 1988.
FCC makes a public equity issue to raise about CDollars 177m to be paid to
the parent in part satisfaction of the purchase price for Crown Forest.
FCL will finance the balance of the purchase price partly by taking up FCC
equity to maintain its interest at 72 per cent.
Mr Raymond Kilroy, pulp and paper analyst with Nesbitt Thomson, Toronto,
said that the terms were reasonable and they were in line with industry
values.
The enlarged FCC will have a favourable debt-equity ratio of 30-70.
'The mills are in excellent shape and both companies have already shed non
profitable assets.
'The new FCC will be ready for the upturn in 1993-4,' he said.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Franco launches war over medicines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVER since Brazil's President Itamar Franco found the cost of his
mouth-ulcer ointment had gone up again, the price of medicines has been the
most prominent issue of his government, and a symbol of his populist style.
Barely a day goes by without Mr Franco complaining about so-called 'abusive
price increases' by the pharmaceutical industry, which claims to be simply
keeping up with 25 per cent a month inflation.
Yesterday, Mr Franco formally declared war, announcing he would take legal
action against all companies raising prices above inflation, and ordering
the Inland Revenue to investigate their tax position.
He also authorised a Dollars 1.1bn donation to state- and army-owned
laboratories to make drugs at lower prices.
The drugs companies are the latest target in a long-running battle between
successive Brazilian governments and oligopolies that characterise much of
the country's industry.
The fact that the main pharmaceutical companies are foreign has brought
nationalist sentiment behind Mr Franco's crusade.
Mr Pedro Motta Veiga, director of the Foreign Trade Foundation, says: 'If
anyone was thinking of investing in Brazil this would be very off-putting.
Itamar goes after the drugs companies, Collor the car manufacturers. Who
knows what the next president will target?'
Until October 1991, medicine prices were government-controlled and kept so
low that 13 foreign companies left Brazil and 34 national companies closed.
After liberation, an accord was reached to allow companies to raise prices
by monthly inflation plus a real 6 per cent increment to compensate for past
losses.
The current row was sparked last month when the industry announced a 25 per
cent price rise agreed in its monthly meeting with economy ministry
officials, to compensate for October inflation of 26.5 per cent. After a
furious Mr Franco suspended the accord, the companies agreed to cut the
increase to 23.38 per cent and grant a 10 per cent discount on 76 medicines
in frequent use.
This month, the industry announced increases of 21-26 per cent, prompting an
angry protest note from the Presidency accusing the companies of 'civil
disobedience'.
Mr Jose Eduardo Bandeira de Mello, vice-president of the Association of
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (Abifarma), says he had advised the health
ministry of the increases, and protests: 'All sectors of economy are
readjusting prices according to inflation. Why can't we do the same?'
But according to figures released yesterday by the Department of Economic
Defence, medicines have increased by an average 3,770.5 per cent in the past
year, against inflation of 1,483 per cent. Some drugs have gone up by as
much as 16,128 per cent. Abifarma retorts that since 1982 their prices have
gone up 397,831 per cent, against inflation of 616,985.20 per cent.
Businessmen fear Mr Franco's concern with medicine prices may be the first
step to reintroduction of price controls or a new price freeze, arguing that
if he was really concerned about people's ability to afford medicines, he
would cut sales tax, or offer medicine vouchers, rather than give money to
state laboratories.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Peruvian army's anger rumbles on: Growing calls for amnesty
echo its resentment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MONTH after the failed coup attempt against the government of President
Alberto Fujimori, newly elected congressmen are calling for an amnesty for
the military involved. As resentment within the armed forces at the
treatment of their arrested colleagues spreads, and with the installation of
the new congress just a fortnight away, Peru's new politicians say it is
time for national reconciliation.
Tension heightened at the weekend when the government took the unprecedented
step of sending four leading generals, including the coup ringleader,
retired Gen Jaime Salinas Sedo, to Lima's infamous Castro high-security
prison.
'This is criminal,' said Mr Javier Valle Riestra, acting defence counsel for
Gen Salinas since his previous lawyer, Mr Alberto Borea, was banned from
acting for his client last week by the military judge trying the case. Mr
Borea is one of a number of civilians allegedly implicated in the aborted
coup attempt of November 13.
'The four generals, and nine or 10 other senior officers, are held like
common delinquents in a prison for drug traffickers and terrorists,' Mr
Valle Riestra said. 'The only purpose can be to intimidate any other
officers who have the same constitutionalist leanings.'
Gen Salinas has justified the November 13 coup attempt in repeated
statements smuggled out of his previous army detention centre. He claims Mr
Fujimori's April 5 overturning of the 1979 constitution gave the armed
forces the right and indeed the duty to rebel. His arguments have got
support from consitutionalists and politicians. Gen Salinas has consistently
denied Mr Fujimori's allegations that the plotters intended to assassinate
the president. Sources close to senior Peruvian military men say the
treatment meted out to the officers under arrest has angered their armed
forces' colleagues. Army wives have protested that the interrogation of
their husbands included torture at the hands of the national intelligence
service.
Although the top military backed Mr Fujimori's April moves to dissolve
congress, there have been rumblings of discontent in the middle ranks of all
three services for some months. Low pay is a prime concern, as are recent
modifications to internal promotion and retirement systems. Some officers at
commander, major and captain level (who call themselves Comaca), have been
circulating pamphlets accusing their superiors of 'servility' to the
government.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Fundamental shift occurring in world pulp industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FUNDAMENTAL shift in the pulp industry is occurring between the northern
and southern hemispheres. The southern hemisphere, mostly South America and
Asia, will become the world's forest plantation and pulp factory, while the
north will increasingly supply specialist papers, said Mr Erling Lorentzen,
chairman of Aracruz Celulose, the largest South American pulp group.
The warning has serious implications for pulp and paper industries in
Scandinavia and North America. Forestry represents 40 per cent of Finland's
exports, 20 per cent of Sweden's and 15 per cent of Canada's.
Mr Lorentzen, addressing the Financial Times pulp and paper conference in
London, said he doubted one company could embrace the skills needed for
large-scale pulp production and manufacture and marketing of paper.
Paper production would be concentrated near customer markets, to keep costs
low and satisfy clients' delivery needs.
But northern hemisphere pulp manufacturers were at a disadvantage and would
have to rationalise.
Those most threatened were high cost producers. Production costs per tonne
for bleached hardwood kraft pulp were Dollars 247 in Brazil, Dollars 300 in
Finland, Dollars 365 in Sweden and Dollars 370 in Canada.
The most important component was the cost of wood. Brazilian plantations
were more productive than those in the northern hemisphere. Eucalyptus takes
about seven years to harvest, against as much as 60 years for pine in
Scandinavia.
Substitution of eucalyptus for bleached northern kraft pulp is already
occurring, the market research company Hawkins Wright, says. Eucalyptus has
increased its market share by 800,000 tonnes between 1989 and last year;
bleached northern kraft pulp lost nearly 1m tonnes.
The recession and rising environmental demands would speed rationalisation,
Mr Lorentzen warned.
Hawkins Wright says world demand for chemical market pulp rose 1.7 per cent
between 1987 and 1992 from 26.1m tonnes to 27.8m. Capacity rose 5.3 per cent
from 26.7m to 32m.

THE heads of the three biggest US airlines have written to President George
Bush, urging him to reject the proposed tie-up between British Airways and
USAir. The letter was timed to arrive ahead of the visit by Mr John Major,
UK prime minister, to Washington this week.
The 'big three' US airlines, fearful Mr Major will press for approval of the
deal, urge Mr Bush 'to resist 11th-hour promises that fall short of a fair
and balanced transaction, and mortgage the future' of the US airline
industry.
'To compete with British Airways, US airlines must be able to offer the same
products as British Airways,' they say. 'To do that, they must have expanded
authority to London and rights to fly within and beyond the UK to all points
served by British Airways.'
The Bush Administration is to decide on the deal before Christmas.
President-elect Bill Clinton has hinted he will not approve it unless US
carriers win extra access to the UK.

It is alleged that steel erection company JN Rowen of Sutton in Ashfield,
Nottinghamshire, which designed the crane base, failed to ensure a temporary
steel grillage that supported the crane and its fixings was safe. A John

The outcome of the Chilean presidential elections in December 1993 was

Given the Christian Democrats' dominance of the ruling centre-left coalition

Observer has heard of quite a few First National banks and even knows the
address of the Second National Bank of Saginaw. But what is the Fifth Third
bank? Based in Cincinnati, where Simon has its US operation, it was formed
in 1908 after the merger of the Fifth and Third National banks. It is by all

At first glance the 2 per cent rise in Vodafone's shares looks an excessive
reaction to its Australian licence. The service will cost Pounds 200m to

just likes to see the company diversifying. Doubtless it would be even more
pleased if a German licence was granted too, though that will not follow
automatically from the Australian award.
Without diversification, Vodafone would have no long-term hope of
maintaining the cracking growth it has established in the UK. In theory it
should not falter in the short term. Price adjustments to attract low volume
users have generated extra revenues, though not much extra profit, and
Vodafone is geared to economic recovery. But competitive price cutting could
revive after Christmas, and the regulator's eye may eventually be caught by
Vodafone's extraordinary returns. Diversification provides some protection
against these risks, but investors might remember the slow pay-off before
marking the shares up much further.

FT  16 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: ANZ unit extends Islamic role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANZ Grindlays Bank is broadening its involvement in Islamic financing
techniques by arranging what it says is the first Istisna project financing
facility in Pakistan.
The Dollars 92m six-month facility was provided to Hub Power Company, a
private sector joint venture company building an oil-fired power station at
the mouth of the Hub river. It was structured and funded by Al Rajhi Banking
and Investment Corporation of Saudi Arabia.
The term Istisna relates to the purchase of a specific piece of equipment
made to order. The investor buys the equipment then sells it to the project,
which pays for it six months later. The difference between the purchase and
payment prices represents the profit element for the investor, rather than
interest.
Disbursement of the funds under the facility will allow work to start on the
Dollars 1.8bn project, which is Pakistan's first private sector power
scheme. ANZ has become something of a specialist in Islamic financings
through its work in arranging a series of Morabaha short-term commodity
transactions.

<TEXT>
MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, said yesterday it had agreed to sell its
40 per cent stake in Grupo IRSA, a joint venture commodity chemicals company
in Mexico.
Financial terms were not disclosed, but it is understood Monsanto will
receive about Dollars 50m for its shareholding and the sale will occur
before year-end. The buyer is DESC Sociedad de Fomento Industrial,
Monsanto's partner in the Mexican venture and the holder of 60 per cent of
its equity.
The Mexican joint venture, which was formed in 1971, has about Dollars 400m
of annual revenues and 19 plants in Mexico.
Mr Robert Reynolds, a Monsanto vice-president and managing director for
Latin America, said changes in Monsanto's worldwide product portfolio had
led to the decision.
Mr Reynolds said Monsanto still had a significant presence in Mexican
markets through local subsidiaries, and that co-operation would continue
with DESC in some areas.
Last August, Monsanto agreed to sell its Fischer Controls subsidiary in the
US for Dollars 1.275bn. Last month, the company disclosed an extraordinary
after-tax charge of Dollars 425m against fourth-quarter earnings, and said
it planned to cut 3,200 jobs.

FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Italian carrier acquires 30%
stake in Malev
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALITALIA, Italy's state airline, yesterday cast aside its long-declared
policy of avoiding alliances and equity stakes in other airlines by buying a
30 per cent share in Malev, the Hungarian national carrier.
A further 5 per cent is being bought by Simest, a recently-created Italian
state agency to promote investment abroad. Together the consortium is paying
Dollars 77m for a combined 35 per cent share.
The value of the deal to Malev has been enhanced by Alitalia's undertaking
to transfer routes to the Hungarian airline, increasing the total value of
the transaction to around Dollars 100m, bankers said.
Alitalia will gain three seats on Malev's nine-member board as well as
appointing two of the seven representatives on its supervisory board.
The Italian carrier will be 'deeply involved' in strategic decisions taken
by its Hungarian partner. However, Mr Andras Pakay, managing director of
Malev, said important strategic decisions would be taken jointly. Malev will
also retain its national identity.
The Italian offer easily beat a rival bid from Lufthansa, the German flag
carrier, which was prepared to pay Dollars 59m. Only Dollars 9m-Dollars 10m
of that would have been in cash and an association with Lufthansa would have
almost certainly quashed Malev's ambitions to develop intercontinental
routes.
The deal is the latest in a series of equity links between west and east
European companies. Earlier this year, a consortium headed by Air France
took 40 per cent of CSA, the Czechoslovak carrier, for Dollars 60m. LOT of
Poland and Balkan of Bulgaria have also appointed financial advisers to
search for western partners.
Alitalia and Malev intend to integrate their services starting from the
summer 1993 timetable and develop Budapest as a third hub alongside Rome and
Milan. Alitalia will also gradually transfer to Malev exclusive rights to
fly between Italy and Hungary.
The two companies gave no estimate for the impact on sales and earnings of
the tie-up. Malev's pre-tax earnings of over Dollars 28m last year made it
eastern Europe's most profitable airline. The company's 1m passengers last
year contributed to sales of Dollars 315m.
Alitalia, one of west Europe's largest airline with over 17m passengers,
lost L35bn (Dollars 25m) in 1991 on sales of almost L6,000bn.
Malev will use the proceeds to finance the 15 per cent down payment on two
new extended-range Boeing 767 aircraft due for delivery next year and for
further computerisation. Malev currently operates 18 Russian-made Tupelov
jets.

FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: French insurers seek tax help
over property crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH INSURERS are calling on the government for tax breaks to help them
through the property crisis, less than a week after banks appealed for state
assistance over bad property loans.
The request comes from the Federation Francaise des Societes d'Assurance,
which estimates its members have a combined property investment portfolio
worth FFr300bn (Dollars 56.6bn), on top of the FFr250bn to FFr500bn property
loans made by banks, some of which are also insurance company subsidiaries.
Average rentals on Parisian property have fallen by 20 per cent over the
past three years, provoking heavy provisions by banks with loans to property
developers.
The FFSA's appeal, made at a convention of its members, comes just as the
government is putting the finishing touches to measures to support the
property industry, which Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said would
be announced in the next few days.
The FFSA has called for investors to be excused capital gains tax on
property, on condition they reinvest capital gains in building rented
housing or offices for which planning permission was obtained before January
1993.
Among its other ideas are a tax exempt property savings plan, similar to an
existing share savings scheme and the creation of a national data base on
property prices to help investors avoid price explosions such as the one
which preceded the present decline in property values.
Mr Sapin is more interested in possible measures to support the construction
industry, an important employer, rather than bailing out institutional
investors or property developers, said property analysts. This reflects the
influence of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, who is understood to
be reluctant to do anything that might be misinterpreted as bailing out
property speculators.
Any proposals could well take the form of big infrastructure projects as
envisaged in the European growth initiative, agreed at the Edinburgh summit.
In the meantime, Mr Sapin has attempted to calm the property market.
'Contrary to certain foreign experiences, one should treat property assets
as long-term holdings and avoid the collapse in prices which could be
harmful to the financial system,' he told a dinner held by the Association
Francaise des Banques on Monday evening.
The crisis would hit banks but not threaten their financial 'foundations,'
he argued. Office property prices were now showing signs of stabilising
after having reached 'excessive levels', especially in Paris, while the fall
in housing prices benefited potential home owners.

SHARES OF Reliance Security Group fell 18p to 123p following the
announcement of an 11 per cent downturn in pre-tax profits to Pounds 905,000
for the 27 weeks to November 6.
Mr Brian Kingham, chairman of the USM-quoted security provider, said the
fall included a reduced loss of Pounds 502,000 (Pounds 772,000) from the
electronic security surveillance business.
He was encouraged by an 8 per cent improvement in turnover to Pounds 34.1m
but pointed out that lower profits reflected the impact of recession which
was most notable in reduced margins.
Earnings amounted to 2.7p (3p) per share and the interim dividend is held at
1.1p.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Eurotunnel offer rejected by contractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSMANCHE Link, the group of contractors building the Channel tunnel,
yesterday brought into the open the simmering row over payments from
Eurotunnel and implied that completion of Europe's largest construction
project could be further delayed.
A statement issued by TML's 10 contractor members said Eurotunnel had made
an inadequate offer of Pounds 1.2bn to settle the cost overrun on fixed
equipment and fitting out of the tunnel. In particular, Eurotunnel's offer
that about Pounds 200m of this should be paid with instruments such as
shares, bonds and convertible instruments was unacceptable.
The statement, a year before the Channel tunnel is scheduled to operate,
suggests that lack of co-operation between contractors and Eurotunnel could
further delay the opening until the first quarter of 1994. Eurotunnel's
shares closed down 11p at 329p.
Admission of the disagreement comes after events had been moving against the
TML contractors. One observer said: 'TML is running out of the main weapon
it has, which is time.'
Last month the committee of 220 creditor banks agreed to allow Eurotunnel to
continue drawing down on its Pounds 6.8bn facility until after May 1994,
when even the greatest pessimists expect the tunnel to be open.
The longer the row continues, however, the less likely is a phased
introduction of tunnel operations allowing goods trains to begin before
passenger operations. The two sides have been negotiating this contract
modification, which could favour Eurotunnel by hastening revenue-earning.
TML's main concern appears to be the composition of the Pounds 1.2bn
payment. It believes that since Eurotunnel's offer in the summer, the cash
element has been reduced and the non-cash element has increased. Eurotunnel
accepts this but says it falls within the August offer. Both sides stress
they are willing to continue talking and work on the project is continuing.
TML's joint chairmen said that an early settlement would 'allow
revenue-earning services to commence as soon as possible'.
Eurotunnel said its priority was to complete the project as early as already
agreed possible 'so that it can open for revenue service in December 1993'.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Chilean dam to win funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Environmentalists in the US and Chile are mounting a rearguard action
against a proposed Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) hydroelectric project which
they say will spoil the rugged beauty of Chile's Bo-Bo river and threaten
the culture of the Pehuenche Indians.
In the centre of the controversy is the International Finance Corporation,
the private-sector arm of the World Bank, which tomorrow is expected to
approve funding for the Dollars 500m Pangue Project. This is the first dam
in a proposed series of six, and the largest, most controversial
hydroelectric project to receive IFC financing.
Because other privatised energy companies will be seeking funds, IFC's
handling of Pangue is likely to set environmental standards for projects to
follow. Strongly aware of public concern, the IFC took seriously the need to
work with the opposition.
Chile's environmental record is enough to give any investor pause. While
pushing ahead with economic growth under the Pinochet government, Chile also
despoiled its resources.
Santiago is second only to Mexico City in air pollution according to the
Natural Resources Defence Council, co-ordinating opposition to the project
in Washington. 'Copper smelting operations in northern Chile have produced
dangerous blood levels of arsenic among local populations.
'Commercial logging of Southern Chile's native forests is rapidly
eliminating some of the world's oldest temperate rain forest ecosystems.
Overfishing has left all of Chile's important commercial fisheries in
critical condition,' says the NRDC.
Now a democracy, Chile has a fledging environmental movement which looks
with suspicion at plans to develop the river. Three suits have been filed in
Chilean courts to stop the project.
ENDESA, the privatised electric company, planned the Bo-Bo development with
no analysis of energy alternatives, and little public discussion or
consultation with the Pehuenche. However, it needs foreign capital to
complete even the first dam.
After complaints from the NRDC and Grupo de Accion por el Bo-Bo, the IFC
required a comprehensive environment assessment and an independent study of
energy alternatives. It hired an independent consultant to evaluate the
environmental assessment and overcame ENDESA resistance to making the
results public.
Pangue, due to be completed in 1997, is not a large dam by World Bank
standards. It will create a reservoir 14km long, flooding an area of 400
hectares. Only 53 people will have to be relocated. The most immediate
impact will be on white water rafters and kayakers.
Environmentalists say the forests around the dam could become susceptible to
logging, threatening an ecosystem which supports many rare and endangered
species. These include the Araucaria trees, which produce pine nuts gathered
by the Pehuenche; the Andean condors, pumas, and the tiny pudu deer.
Operation of the dam will change the river's chemistry, endangering
fisheries.
ENDESA has promised numerous measures to mitigate the impact of the Pangue
construction. It has also agreed to the Pangue Foundation, funded through an
annual grant of Dollars 140,000 or 0.3 per cent of the project's net income,
to help the Pehuenche communities.
None of this has satisfied the Pangue opposition, which criticises the
dearth of public debate in Chile over the project. Glen Prickett of the NRDC
believes an energy conservation programme could satisfy the short to
medium-term demand for new electricity in Chile, giving time for new
developments in solar and biomass technologies.
However, Monenco, the Canadian consulting company hired to assess energy
alternatives, concluded that the Pangue project represented the best option
for supplying near-term energy needs.
The dam will be almost impossible to stop; construction is already under
way. However, the IFC has made no commitment on the next five dams. It has
also got ENDESA to agree to study the cumulative impact of the other dams on
the Bo-Bo and its people before further development.

FT  16 DEC 92 / People: 'Managed career' leads to Pru
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prudential has recruited Symon Elliott, director of consumer banking in
Britain at Allied Irish Bank, as its new managing director of Prudential
Investment Products (PIP), to replace Alan Wren who left in September.
Keith Bedell-Pearce, chief executive of the Pru's financial services group,
explains that Wren's departure was prompted by a 'cleaning up' of
responsibilities within this area.
Hence, whereas Wren had previously been in charge of production, marketing
and distribution, responsibilities on the distribution side - whether
through direct sales or via intermediaries - had been passed to the managing
directors in charge of the specialist salesforces.
This leaves the managing director of PIP in charge of production, strategic
marketing and customer service for unit trusts, PEPs, and currency funds.
Bedell-Pearce says that the current climate afforded him a wide range of
candidates in the course of his search, both 'seasoned campaigners from the
unit trust and PEP business' as well as those from outside who measured up
to his 'person specification'. Elliott, 35, who has an MBA from the London
Business School, fell into the latter category.
The financial services chief says he was attracted by an individual who had
'consciously managed his career'. After a spell in corporate planning at BP,
Elliott was sales and marketing director at TSB Direct, and most recently
director of consumer banking in Britain for Allied Irish Bank.
'At both TSB and Allied Irish, he had responsibility for delivering sales
through distribution channels over which he had no direct control. It will
be an identical situation at the Pru where you have to use persuasion rather
than direct management control.'
A contributory factor to Wren's departure was Bedell Pearce's decision to
put expansion into continental Europe 'on hold' until the economic climate
changed. Bedell-Pearce says that the decision, reached in April, has been
vindicated given the current gloomy prospects for Germany, the country in
which the Pru would have wanted to initiate its push into Europe.

FT  16 DEC 92 / People: Gold quits Scottish Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Gold, one of two joint managing directors of Scottish Enterprise, the
official development body for southern Scotland, is to retire from the
organisation in March at the age of 52, Scottish Enterprise said yesterday.
His departure will mean that the posts of both managing directors are
becoming vacant. On November 28, John Cond-liffe, Gold's fellow managing
director, died suddenly at the age of 46.
The vacancies could lead to a reorganisation of the management structure of
Scottish Enterprise, which began operating in April 1991.
The system of having joint managing directors, with Gold responsible for
corporate services and Condliffe handling strategy and the operations of the
13 local enterprise companies in the Scottish Enterprise network, was put in
place before Crawford Beveridge, the ceo, took up his appointment early last
year.
Earlier this year it was learnt that Beveridge wanted to simplify the
structure but no change was made.
Two further changes are in the pipeline. First, dozens of jobs at Scottish
Enterprise's Glasgow headquarters are likely to go in the next few months
because of cuts in the organisation's budget. Secondly, Sir David Nickson,
chairman of Scottish Enterprise, hands over next month to Professor Donald
MacKay, an economic consultant and one of Scotland's leading economists.
Gold has been a key figure in shaping Scottish Enterprise, formed through a
merger of the Scottish Development Agency and the Training Agency in
Scotland, of which he had been Scottish director. He says he is looking
forward to 'new and fresh challenges' after 33 years in public service, but
although he has received invitations to consider possible posts, nothing has
been fixed up.
*****
Hogg Group, the insurance broker, has announced a reorganisation of its
senior management which sees James Vaughn, stepping down from his position
as executive chairman. Vaughn, now 65, will remain on the board, becoming a
non-executive joint deputy chairman and a member of a newly formed executive
committee. Anthony Howland Jackson, 51, currently chief executive, takes
over from Vaughn as executive chairman. Vaughn, an American who joined Hogg
in 1983, says he intends to spend less time on day-to-day company matters.
On the other hand he remains chairman of Hogg's North American subsidiary
and hopes to spend at least half of each year in New York.
*****
The ITV Network Centre, which will have more than Pounds 500m a year
available to commission programmes for ITV, has appointed Vernon Lawrence as
controller of network drama and entertainment.
Lawrence, the current controller of entertainment at Yorkshire where he
commissioned some of ITV's biggest successes such as Darling Buds of May, is
the latest to join the new commissioning team. Last week Stuart Prebble of
Granada Television joined as controller of factual programmes.
The appointment of Lawrence, 52, of both drama and entertainment brings
together two important roles in ITV. He will have two deputies: one
responsible for drama and the other for entertainment.
*****
Adrian Day has been appointed managing director of Racal Radio, part of the
Racal Electronics Group. Managing director of Racal Recorders for the past
three years, Day has been brought across to strengthen the management team
at Racal Radio. He will be focusing on developing the group's military
communications business. David Poole (above) has been appointed md of Racal
Recorders Group. Martin Lea, formerly sales and marketing director of
Racal-Datacom, succeeds Poole as md.
*****
Wellcome, the UK drugs group, has acknowledged the move towards more
collaborative ventures in the pharmaceuticals industry with the creation of
a new post of director of group licensing.
The new incumbent is Mark Weedon (above), formerly president of Wellcome's
Canadian subsidiary. John Robb, chief executive, says an indication of the
job's importance is that Weedon will report directly to him.
The decision to create the post - taken unanimously by Wellcome's top 50
managers - was to help fill critical gaps in the group's product and
geographical spread. 'Not all sides have been covered. We need to look at
more co-development agreements, particularly in Japan where partners can
help us push drugs through the regulatory process,' says Robb. He says
Wellcome's presence in Japan is too narrowly based with only two products.
Yet Japan remains the world's second largest market.
The job will also entail completing the group's portfolio by licensing in
drugs, as well as licensing out those drugs that do not fit the core
portfolio.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCE director, specially clad for the occasion in ski jacket, jeans
and trainers, explained management-employee relations at his factory.
'People work when and if they want to - including the children.'
The Kayapo Indians of A-Ukre village, deep in the Amazonian rainforest - all
238 of them - are founding members of the A-Ukre Trading Company, which
harvests Brazil nuts to produce oil for export to the UK.
The company was set up in 1990 and last year exported its first production
run of 1,500 kilos of virgin cold-pressed oil. This year, about 5,500 kilos
are expected. The Body Shop has contracted to buy whatever is produced, for
use in hair conditioners.
The factory is run as a co-operative - everyone earns the same rate and
everyone pitches in, says Bephoti, finance director and A-Ukre warrior.
'They like it because Brazil nut oil production does not destroy the forest
or ruin the rivers. When our children are our age they will still be able to
make and sell oil,' he says.
After wages, the income goes into a community fund to pay for medical
treatment, fishing hooks, hunting ammunition, and maintenance and fuel costs
for fishing boats and an aeroplane - to make hospital trips. Village
settlement has introduced previously unknown health problems to the Kayapo.
Bephoti was in London recently with Ropkran, another Kayapo Indian from
Pukanu village. He is production director of the Pukanu Trading Company,
which is planning to produce Brazil nut oil and bead bracelets for export.
The warriors' five-day trip was to raise funds for development schemes - in
association with the Body Shop - to help their communities become
self-sufficient.
Companies in the UK are being asked to invest - either financially or by
donating relevant products - in a dental project, health care and education
schemes, and in rainforest research. The businessmen were also working on a
video project to record their culture.

FT  16 DEC 92 / Eurofighter has lift-off but its flight schedule is
uncertain: Questions remain about production of the aircraft which will
sustain Europe's defence industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European defence industry's largest new collaborative project is back in
business. The restoration of a partnership between Britain, Germany, Italy
and Spain to press ahead with the former European Fighter Aircraft, now
unimaginatively renamed Eurofighter 2000, promises work for their aerospace
and electronics companies well into the next decade.
But having examined last week's agreement between defence ministers there
are still uncertainties about how and when production will be carried out.
Over the next six months the partners have to work out changes in
specifications, how to accommodate different requirements and how to
reallocate production to achieve aimed-for cost reductions in the Pounds
20bn-plus project.
Germany, after saying this summer that it would not go beyond development,
is still not formally committed to production and is not due to decide, by
vote of parliament, until 1995. This is after its next general election.
'There are really more questions than answers for the time being,' said
Deutsche Aerospace (DASA). The Daimler-Benz subsidiary, with divisions
involved in the airframe, engines and radar and electronic systems, is the
company that would have suffered the biggest immediate impact if Germany had
pulled out.
The other main industrial participants are British Aerospace, GEC-Marconi,
Rolls-Royce, the Italian Alenia and Fiat groups and Construcciones
Aeronauticas (CASA) of Spain.
According to the Society of British Aerospace Companies, 14,500-15,000
people are already engaged in Eurofighter work in Britain. BAe says it has
about 1,000 directly involved in the programme; Rolls-Royce 2,000; and
GEC-Marconi, described by its managing director Mr David Fletcher as having
'more at stake on that aircraft than any other UK company', about 3,000.
Estimates of the number of UK jobs the programme will sustain at the height
of production vary from 28,000 to 40,000. German industry reckons on direct
employment of 20,000, with a similar number of indirect jobs.
In Italy Alenia alone has 1,500 people engaged in development work on the
airframe and electronics. This is expected to rise to more than 5,000 out of
total Italian employment of 9,000.
But all companies will have to cope with a slower build-up in the programme.
BAe is pinning hopes on a Saudi Arabian order to enable it to resume
production of Tornado bombers at its main military aircraft plant at Warton,
Lancashire. Otherwise it will have to rely on upgrade work and assembly of
Hawk light fighters to keep the plant going until Eurofighter production
starts in four or five years. Two years ago, the expectation was that it
would begin in 1994.
Spending on development is being slowed down, even though the programme has
already fallen a year behind. The first prototype is now expected to fly
early next year.
Britain and Italy both want their first production Eurofighters in the year
2000. This means they have to find ways to start setting up production
before Germany has decided whether it will purchase the aircraft or how many
 -a decision that will determine its final share in the programme.
The fact that Germany and Spain do not want Eurofighters before 2002 means
that the others will presumably have to take all the early production
aircraft, complicating their spending plans.
A study by the industrial partners in October identified possible cost
savings of 13 per cent by centralising some production, reassessing logistic
support costs and purchasing some equipment off the shelf. Further
reductions - bringing total savings to the 30 per cent German target - were
possible if partners wanted less sophisticated equipment.
British officials insist that the revised project will bring some savings to
the UK, against an earlier estimated 'flyaway' price - excluding the cost of
development, tooling, spares or support - of Pounds 30m per aircraft. But
how much will be partly determined by other partners' decisions.
The current premise is that the 'basic' Eurofighter will keep the same
airframe, engines and radar. But it is unclear whether Germany will want the
joint ECR90 radar, a UK-led project which it endorsed reluctantly in early
1990. If it does not, the UK would have to assume a greater share of the
ECR90's cost.
Partners will in any case need to decide on new workshares for the
production phase.
Questions focus, for instance, on whether the wings should continue to be
made by three countries - an Italian port wing and a starboard wing shared
by Britain and Spain. Practices such as flying printed circuit boards around
for different partners to do work on them are due to stop. However, none of
the four countries is ready to abandon its claim to a final assembly line.

FT  16 DEC 92 / IBM to cut 25,000 more jobs: Global capacity to be reduced -
Dollars 6bn charge / Dividend threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, reeling from a global economic slowdown and
a rapidly changing computer market, yesterday announced plans to cut its
worldwide workforce by 25,000, or 8 per cent, next year and sharply reduce
its manufacturing capacity. It will take a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn)
fourth-quarter charge to cover the costs.
The news sent the company's shares plunging nearly 11 per cent to close at
Dollars 56 1/8 , down Dollars 6 3/4 . This is their lowest level for a
decade and compares with the 1992 high of Dollars 100 3/8 .
In a sign of the severity of the crisis it faces, IBM made clear that two of
its treasured traditions - maintenance of annual dividend and a policy of no
forced redundancies - were no longer safe.
Wall Street analysts estimated that the company, the world's largest
computer manufacturer, was heading for a 1992 loss after charges of about
Dollars 4.75bn and sentiment towards the company remained extremely
negative.
Mr Stephen Smith of Paine-Webber said: 'These actions don't go far enough
and the outlook for mainframe computers is very bleak.' With the dividend at
risk, he felt that the stock could fall below Dollars 50.
Mr John Akers, IBM chairman, said that while cash flow remained strong,
'current earnings expectations make the company unsure of its ability to
maintain the dividend at current levels'. He added that while IBM would try
to achieve job cuts voluntarily, if business conditions did not improve
significantly 'it is likely that some business units will be unable to
maintain full employment in 1993'.
Since 1986 the company has cut its workforce by about 100,000 to some
300,000. Nearly half the job cuts announced yesterday will be in Europe but
full details were unclear last night.
IBM Germany, however, said that next year it would cut rather more than the
2,000 jobs it shed in 1993. It would not rule out further redundancies as a
way of reducing the workforce.
IBM UK said it expected to cut up to 1,000 jobs in 1993, the same as this
year. By the end of 1993, the workforce could be down to 13,000 in the UK,
about 5,000 less than in 1990.
Worldwide, the company is to cut its development spending by about Dollars
1bn, or roughly one sixth, in 1993, reduce capital spending and cut sales,
general and administrative expenses by Dollars 1bn.
IBM added that its fourth-quarter operating results were only likely to be
around break-even - well below Wall Street forecasts - because of the
unexpected depth of the business downturn, particularly in Europe, prolonged
worldwide economic weakness and market pressures to cut hardware prices.
It warned that it expected the unfavourable conditions to continue into
1993.
This is the latest in a series of restructurings by IBM since the late 1980s
as it has struggled with the global economic slowdown, which began in the
US, and the extremely rapid pace of change in the computer industry.
IBM, which has dominated the market for large, mainframe computers, has
suffered from the shift of demand to smaller, desk-top models because its
bureaucratic structure has not responded sufficiently quickly.
The latest round of cuts comes on top of Dollars 5.4bn of special pre-tax
charges so far this year to cover plant closures and 40,000 job cuts. The
total charge this year comes to Dollars 11.4bn.
Mr Akers said trading conditions had deteriorated more precipitously than
expected. The company said its personal computer business, which introduced
an inexpensive new line in the autumn, was seeing strong sales growth and
was moving towards profitability in 1993, but the mainframe business had
suffered a 10 per cent fall in revenues during 1992.
Asked by journalists whether he had considered stepping down, Mr Akers, who
has been chairman for six years, said he had given no thought to the matter
because IBM was on the right track and the board supported him.

FT  16 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Cracks in the tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the tortuous history of disputes between Eurotunnel and its contractors,
it has often been hard to distinguish between brinkmanship and
irreconcilable disagreement. Yesterday's announcement by TML that
negotiations are at a standstill perhaps amounts to little more than a
vigorous shaking of the publicity tree.
TML's implicit threat is that if Eurotunnel does not settle terms on the
disputed Pounds 1.2bn of cost over-runs it will work to rule, delaying the
partial opening of the tunnel now forecast for December 1993. Any such
postponement would be punitively expensive for Eurotunnel. On some
estimates, the bill could amount to Pounds 100m a month, pushing the
project's break-even point ever further into the distance. The uncertainty
would be particularly unwelcome for Eurotunnel as it ponders how to raise
fresh funds when its banking waivers expire in 1994.
But despite the high stakes, Eurotunnel's pugnacious chairman, Sir Alastair
Morton, may yet be inclined to call TML's bluff. The value of the
contractors' outstanding work is small and TML would not appreciate being
identified as the consortium that spoiled the opening party. Given that part
of its payment will also be in Eurotunnel shares and loan stock, it hardly
makes sense to cause too much disruption. The longer the row, the more the
value of Eurotunnel's paper will fall. Contractors already complain about
the uncertain worth of Eurotunnel's equity. Sadly, shareholders must know
exactly how they feel. Yesterday's spat wiped a further 3 per cent off the
value of their investment.

FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Patent hearing confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN Patent Office hearing yesterday confirmed the first patent for a
herbicide resistant plant, in a test case with important implications for
agrochemical, biotechnology and seeds companies.
The EPO granted the patent to Plant Genetics Systems of Belgium and Biogen
of the US for plants that are genetically engineered to resist Basta, a
broad-spectrum weedkiller made by Hoechst, the German chemical group.
The Munich hearing rejected claims by Greenpeace, the environmental group,
that the patent was immoral 'because the invention would lead to increased
pesticide use and the production of genetically engineered organisms which
pose an excessive risk to the environment.' The European Patent Convention
does not allow 'immoral' products or processes to be patented.
The two biotechnology companies plan to commercialise the invention in
collaboration with Hoechst and several seeds companies.

GENERAL Electric of the US and Hitachi, two of the world's biggest
electrical and industrial combines, yesterday announced a lighting equipment
joint-venture to be based in Tokyo.
The two, which already co-operate in manufacturing heavy-duty power
generation equipment, are to set up Hitachi GE Lighting, headed by a top GE
executive in Japan, Mr Edward Neikeisel.
It will provide GE with access to Hitachi's extensive Japanese network of
distributors, while Hitachi will gain access to the US group's advanced
lighting technology. The venture will be the principal route for sales of GE
and Hitachi lights for commercial, industrial and automotive markets in
Japan.
GE said the venture would become a big importer of light bulbs into Japan
via a specially designed import centre which will handle quality control and
customer service.
Hitachi will also be able to use the venture to export its lighting products
via GE's overseas sales network.

GE LIGHTING, part of General Electric Company of the US, is linking with
Japan's Hitachi to market, sell and distribute lighting equipment in Japan.
The joint venture will give GE access to Hitachi's domestic distribution
network, and will be used to market GE products.
As a result, the companies claimed, the 50-50 owned venture, to be known as
Hitachi GE Lighting, will become a 'major' importer of light bulbs into the
Japanese market.
It will also be used to market new products aimed at Japanese consumers,
principally designed and manufactured by GE.
GE Lighting, with annual turnover of around Dollars 3bn, said sales via the
venture would probably begin in April.
The US company will merge its existing GE Lighting Japan subsidiary into the
new joint venture.
Mr John Opie, president of GE Lighting, said that the venture gave GE 'an
opportunity . . . to enhance significantly our position in the Dollars 2bn
Japanese lighting market, which is expanding much faster than the overall
world lighting market.'

Rock

Wall Street
US SHARE prices remained in easier vein in light trading yesterday as
investors awaited new data on the economy, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the finish the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 11.88 at 3,292.20,
its low for the session and the first time the index has closed below 3,300
in 10 days. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.89 at 432.84, while the
American SE composite eased 0.82 to 392.56 and the Nasdaq composite gave up
1.06 at 654.73.
Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 187m shares and declines outnumbered
rises by 982 to 817.
Trading was relatively subdued at the start, with dealing at some firms
affected by the continued clean-up following the severe storm that struck
New York on Friday and over the weekend.
On the economic front there was nothing new for investors to chew on with
all the upcoming data - on auto sales, business inventories, industrial
production and jobless claims - due out later in the week.
This meant that attention switched to Little Rock, Arkansas, where
President-elect Clinton was holding his two-day economic summit for business
leaders. Although the summit was being closely watched by investors for any
hints at the likely direction of future economic policy, analysts did not
expect much that was new to come out of the meetings.
General Motors slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 as union leaders
prepared to unveil an early-retirment plan that will allow the financially
strapped motor manufacturer to lay off thousands of workers. The two other
big car companies were in mixed form, with Chrysler Dollars  3/8 higher at
Dollars 32 3/8 but Ford Dollars  3/8 easier at Dollars 42 1/4 .
Harley-Davidson fell more than Dollars 1 early on, but picked up to end
Dollars  1/2 down at Dollars 35 3/4 after the motorcycle manufacturer said
it would record a reserve of Dollars 5.5m in the fourth quarter to cover
costs from two product recalls.
PSI Resources firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 19 1/8 in turnover of more than
1m shares on news of a pact to merge PSI with Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric into
a new corporation though a conversion of stock. Cincinnati G &amp; E dipped
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 23 3/4 .
Glacier Water, which warned late on Friday that its earnings for the full
1992 year will be 11 per cent below the 62 cents a share it originally
projected, dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 10 1/4 on the American Stock
Exchange.
On the Nasdaq market, leading stocks were mixed. Biogen, which rose sharply
last week on hopes of higher earnings, climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48
1/4 . Canada
THE Toronto market stayed put for most of the session before ending slightly
lower.
The TSE 300 index was off 5.5 at 3,262.0 and declining issues led advances
by 330 to 281 after volume of 37m shares.
Banking shares were mainly firmer, bolstered by a round of prime lending
rate cuts by several major Canadian banks to 8 1/2 per cent from 8 3/4 per
cent.
A group of investors led by Mr Leland Verner, a Toronto businessman whose
family formerly owned Jordan Wines, is proposing to make a CDollars 20 a
share bid for TG Bright. Jordan Wines is now part of Bright, whose 'A'
shares gained CDollars 2 1/2 at CDollars 17 5/8.

FT  15 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Senior bourses lead Europe into decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was another Nordic flurry last week as the devaluation of the
Norwegian crown took place, but Europe's big bourses reflected industrial
recession. It took a 1.7 per cent rise in Japan to leave the FT-Actuaries
World Index with a 0.4 per cent gain.
Tokyo moved from caution to recovery hopes ahead of the Bank of Japan's
quarterly survey on business sentiment, which brought out profit-takers last
Friday as it showed that confidence had fallen to its lowest level since
1975.
Wall Street, with the Dow held back by fears for majors such as IBM and
General Motors, saw new midweek highs in more broadly based indices and a
rainstorm which flooded parts of downtown Manhattan last Friday. Overall, it
produced an average performance.
Falls in Germany, the UK and France were the main reasons behind a 0.8 per
cent decline in Europe. Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, says Germany is moving into recession and that the
market is too high on a p/e basis, especially in view of the prospect of a
further annual fall in earnings next year.
UK pundits put last week's slide in London down to profit-taking after a
good run. France, although its economy is placed among the soundest in
Europe, is seeing problems in the Parisian property market, gloomy news from
the corporate sector in general and a slippage in earnings forecasts.
Switzerland, however, provided some relief. Having discounted a negative
vote in the referendum on membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), it
rose on the news last Monday and extended its gains to close the week 2.7
per cent higher. Mr Bell observes that pharmaceuticals, food and financials
add up to some three-quarters of the market and that this, together with the
return of the Swiss franc as a safe haven for investors, makes a comforting
contrast to prospects elsewhere.

FT  15 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Eurotrack down despite Spanish
celebrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CELEBRATIONS in Spain after its weekend winnings at the Edinburgh EC summit,
and an extension of last week's Swiss recovery were not enough to take the
FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index into positive territory, writes Our Markets Staff.
Nervous selling in France, Germany and Italy carried more weight.
PARIS featured the Total warning that 1992 earnings would be much weaker
than the year before. The CAC-40 index lost 20.44 to 1,738.26 in turnover of
FFr1.9bn.
Total, down FFr6.7 at FFr227.30, said that the fall in full year earnings
could be as much as 47 per cent but that the group would maintain the FFr7
dividend. The warning affected other stocks and Elf, which said last week
that it expects a 35 per cent drop in 1992 net profit, shed FFr5.90 to
FFr323.30.
LVMH, down FFr60 at FFr3,434, continued to feel the effects of last week's
gloomy forecasts from the UK drinks group, Guinness, in which it has a cross
shareholding, as French brokers downgraded the stock.
FRANKFURT digested a mixed bag of brokers' comments after last week's
losses, and took its declines to a fifth straight day in thin trading. The
DAX index ended down 6.26 at 1,469.75, its lowest for nearly two months, as
turnover fell from DM4.9bn to DM3.1bn.
Volkswagen and Klockner-Werke led the losers: VW said that it was planning
12 days of short-time working in the first quarter of 1993 and the
steelmaker returned from suspension after filing for court protection from
its creditors.
VW touched a new 1992 low of DM238 before steadying to close DM6 down at
DM241 on the session; it recovered further to DM243.50 in London. KW resumed
trading after a one-day halt, dropping DM17.50 to a new 1992 low of DM41.
Retailers weakened on less than spectacular pre-Christmas sales. Kaufhof
dropped DM12 to DM479 and Asko by DM19 to DM656. In the construction sector,
Bilfinger &amp; Berger lost DM23 to DM787 and Hochtief DM20 to DM920.
MADRID improved strongly as a number of positive factors converged: November
inflation figures showed a fall in the year-on-year rate from 5.2 to 5.1 per
cent; there was reaction to Friday's cut in the reserve requirement for
banks by the Bank of Spain; and satisfaction about the deal which Spain had
achieved at the Edinburgh summit. The general index put on 3.20 to 215.53 in
good turnover of some Pta15bn.
Banks were in favour with Popular up Pta250 or 2.3 per cent at Pta10,950 and
BBV by Pta55 to Pta2,465. Repsol was lifted as foreign institutions switched
out of other European oil stocks, and closed Pta45 higher at Pta2,765.
MILAN dropped on poor economic data and privatisation nerves. The three
banks due for privatisation were the hardest hit as the Comit index fell
9.29, or 2.2 per cent to 413.52.
BCI fell L267, or 6 per cent to L4,168; Credito Italiano dropped to L2,640,
down L149, on the kerb and Banca di Roma was indicating L1,675 on the kerb
after closing officially L146 lower at L1,740. Investors were worried that
political infighting might impede the privatisation process.
ZURICH extended last week's rally, the SMI index closing 21.7 higher at a
new 1992 high of 2,015.3. Banks were mixed but SBC rose SFr6 to SFr287 on
the attraction of its dividend yield; among pharmaceuticals, Roche
certificates rose SFr30 SFr4,010 and, in foods, Nestle put on SFr25 to
SFr1,115.
AMSTERDAM saw DSM continue Friday's slide as the group confirmed that it
plans to cut back production of polymers and the CBS Tendency index shed 0.7
to 104.0.
DSM closed down Fl 3.40 or 4.5 per cent at Fl 71.40 while Hoogovens was 30
cents down at Fl 22.50 on worries over the European steel industry.
BRUSSELS closed down for the fourth consecutive session as the Bel-20 index
shed 3.91 to 1,112.65. Solvay, which had earlier hit a new 1992 low of
BFr10,850, managed to recover just before the close to end BFr100 higher at
BFr11,200. Petrofina, which said after the close that it may cut its 1992
dividend by 50 per cent from BFr421 in 1991, managed a BFr10 rise to
BFr7,950.
OSLO continued Friday's fall on profit-taking and the all-share index
slipped 9.85 or 2.5 per cent to 376.07. Investors also remained uncertain
whether the government's fiscal package to boost industry would be approved
by parliament.
The industry index was down 15.38 at 670.39, Norsk Hydro losing NKr4 to
NKr150. Shipping lost 12.99 to 321.19 with Bergesen A losing NKr5 to NKr100
and the B shares down NKr5.50 at NKr100.50.
STOCKHOLM was stronger with the Affarsvarlden index up 5.6 at 888.7 in
turnover of SKr505m.
The banking and financial sector reversed Friday's falls with S-E Banken A
shares rising SKr1.50 to SKr11.50. Trelleborg B shares closed up SKr1.50 at
SKr58.50.
HELSINKI continued to fall on profit-taking after recent strong gains, the
Hex index closing 15.9, or 1.9 per cent lower at 840.7. Bank and finance
company shares declined by 4.9 per cent and the forestry sector by just 1.6
per cent.

FT  15 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls on
profit-taking and arbitrage selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES LOST ground as arbitrage selling and profit-taking outweighed
small-lot buying by public funds and bargain hunters, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The 225-issue Nikkei average fell 151.05 to 17,289.97, having opened at the
day's high of 17,421.97 before slowly losing ground throughout the day, and
hitting the day's low of 17,255.47 just before the close.
Volume dropped to 150m shares from 511m. Declines led advances by 672 to
275, with 193 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
slipped 8.80 to 1,316.35, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 1.24 to
1,061.98.
Investors failed to find trading incentives in last Friday's main events,
the Bank of Japan tankan (quarterly business sentiment report) or the
Japanese cabinet reshuffle. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said
the BoJ survey contained no surprises and that the reported comments of Mr
Yoshiro Hayashi, the new minister of finance, that he did not intend to cut
income taxes did not provide insight to future policy.
Foreign investors became net buyers of stock in the week of November 30 to
December 4 for the first time in five weeks. Although some traders hope that
further foreign interest will lift trading in the near term, most overseas
investors face a year-end closing of books, and are unlikely to take an
active role in the market.
Traders said issues which are seen as beneficiaries of asset revaluation,
required by the international consolidation of accounting laws in 1995,
gained ground. Assets at most Japanese companies are currently booked at
initial purchase prices rather than at market levels. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone advanced Y7,000 to Y550,000.
Short-covering supported Nippon Housing Loan, the troubled housing loan
company. The issue was the most actively traded of the day, rising Y6 to
Y324.
Interest rate-sensitive stocks weakened on disappointment over the failure
of the central bank to cut the official discount rate. Financial shares and
large-capital issues receded on profit-taking: Industrial Bank of Japan
dipped Y30 to Y2,530, Nomura Securities Y10 to Y1,500 and Nippon Steel Y1 to
Y290.
High-technology stocks were hurt by profit-taking. Hitachi relinquished Y4
to Y741 and Fujitsu lost Y18 to Y562.
Nippon Express, a package delivery company, improved Y2 to Y766 on
projections that it will post a 4 per cent increase in profits in the
current fiscal year.
In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 166.64 to 18,862.42 in volume of 21.3m
shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim region was mixed, with activity beginning to ease ahead of
the holidays.
HONG KONG gained ground. Banks were actively traded as the Hang Seng index
put on 14.55 to 5,267.73 in low turnover of HKDollars 1.73bn.
HSBC Holdings declined 50 cents to HKDollars 54.50, while Hang Seng Bank
appreciated 75 cents to HKDollars 48.50.
SEOUL rose for the fourth consecutive session in thin trading as many
investors remained absent ahead of Friday's presidential election. The
composite index added 3.95 at 651.23 in turnover of some Won516bn.
MANILA declined in the absence of fresh news, with the composite index
falling 29.79 to 1,202.56 in combined turnover of 343m pesos. Overnight
losses by PLDT in the US saw its shares close 25 pesos cheaper at 850 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR fell on scattered profit-taking. The composite index lost 2.72
to 632.54 in turnover of MDollars 208m.
Multi-Purpose Holdings shed 20 cents to MDollars 2.25 as an application by
two members of the group, Magnum and Dunlop Estates, to participate in a
gaming venture in southern China met further delays. Magnum dipped 35 cents
to MDollars 9.65 and Dunlop slipped 40 cents to MDollars 8.40. In SINGAPORE
the Straits Times Industrial index eased 2.05 to 1,445.52.
AUSTRALIA overcame early weakness and the All Ordinaries index ended 11.8 up
at 1,512.4 in turnover of ADollars 254.8m.
Among the active issues, CRA moved forward 8 cents to ADollars 12.68 after
saying that the decision by Klockner-Werke, in which it holds a 10 per cent
shareholding, to seek protection from its creditors would have no immediate
impact.
BHP ended 12 cents ahead at ADollars 12.68 and National Australia Bank 15
cents up at ADollars 7.70.
NEW ZEALAND closed firmer, with strong interest in Goodman Fielder as the
NZSE-40 index gained 10.18 to 1,532.10. Turnover came to NZDollars 30.5m.
Goodman Fielder put on 15 cents to NZDollars 2.22 on unsubstantiated rumours
that Nestle was interested in taking a stake. Telecom eased 5 cents to
NZDollars 2.34 on US weakness.
BANGKOK was slightly lower with the SET index down 2.43 at 850.18 in
turnover of Bt2.5bn. Thai Farmers Bank rose Bt12 to Bt700 and Siam
Commercial Bt6 to Bt1,060.
BOMBAY fell again in trading restricted to 90 minutes against the normal
three hours, the BSE index losing 67.42 to 2,469.45 in a continued reaction
to last week's Hindu-Moslem riots, in which over 1,000 people died.

FT  15 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke slide continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLIDE in Ladbroke shares continued as the market heeded the flow of
profit downgrades begun on Friday by Smith New Court, joint broker to the
leisure group. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which two weeks ago upgraded Ladbroke
and last week highlighted the stock as one of its 'ten key buys' for 1993,
yesterday moved the shares to its sell list.
Concern focused on Ladbroke's vulnerability to increased interest charges
triggered by currency fluctuations, estimated by some analysts at some
Pounds 20m in the current trading year.
Mr Paul Heath, leisure analyst at UBS, said: 'Having been told that pre-tax
profits may be down by as much as 25 per cent, we remain very cautious about
the outlook for 1993. 'He also cut his profits forecast, moving from Pounds
215m to Pounds 185m inclusive of disposals this year, and said his 1993
forecast may not be much above that figure. However, others in the market,
while joining in the general downgrade, were more generous, most settling in
the Pounds 195m to Pounds 210m range. The shares tumbled 11 to 169p in heavy
turnover of 11m.
Drug stocks down
A news report that pharmaceuticals groups could lose up to Pounds 450m in UK
sales as a result of planned reforms in Britain's National Health Service
(NHS) was behind a fall in SmithKline Beecham. There was also some
uncertainty following a meeting with analysts by Astra, Swedish rival to
SmithKline.
The NHS reforms, which will prompt creation of blacklists of products that
will no longer be provided by the NHS on prescription, are expected to
affect overseas companies selling in the UK rather than British companies.
However, an instant reaction in SmithKline stock, was compounded by concern
that the Astra analysts' meeting might bring good news concerning Losec, the
Swedish group's anti-ulcer product. This would mean bad news for
SmithKline's Tagamet as well as Glaxo's Zantac, and US investors chose to
sell UK pharmaceuticals stocks. SmithKline fell sharply at the start of US
trading, closing 12 off at 510p and 10 lower in the Units at 456p. Glaxo
eased 2 to 810p.
Owners Abroad
Takeover talk returned to encircle Owners Abroad with rumours that
negotiations with German group LTU were continuing. The tour operators
market had been alive with such talk earlier this year after Owners shares
had fallen from 108p in April to 46p in September. Then, speculation had
pointed to Airtours, the rival operator, and seemed confirmed when Owners
issued a statement confirming that it had received an early approach,
generally thought to have been from Airtours. At its results meeting
recently, Airtours had refused to comment on whether it would rekindle its
interest in Owners.
Meanwhile, German holiday group LTU, which bought the Thomas Cook travel
chain earlier this year, has been holding informal discussions with several
European tour operators. Its talks with Owners have been widely reported in
the trade press. The stock exchange authorities confirmed, at the company's
request, that Owners was still in a 'takeover situation'. The shares rose 5
to 83p. Airtours added 2 at 263p.
There was renewed uncertainty among traders in the oil sector as the two
majors, BP and Shell, stayed in positive territory, in spite of bad news
from two of the top European oil and gas groups, Belgium's Petrofina and
French group Total.
BP closed 2 up at 224p on turnover of 6m and Shell held at 546p. Dealers
said BP had been sustained by yet another bout of US buying, thought to have
been triggered by last Friday's presentation by BP executives to US
institutions.
Lasmo remained in the firing line, sliding 5 to 140p as the market reacted
to growing fears about potential sales from the Morcambe Bay gas field, the
current weakness of oil prices and recent heavy selling by two of the UK's
most influential fund management groups, both of which have notifiable
stakes in Lasmo. Premier Consolidated, meanwhile, edged up  1/4 to 18p, with
some analysts warming to the latest news from the company's drilling success
off the coast of Burma.
BZW, the investment bank, was thought to have been the prime mover behind a
rise of 8 to 678p by Burmah Castrol.
The stabilisation of the Hong Kong market prompted a partial recovery of
confidence in the Far Eastern favourites.
HSBC moved ahead confidently, eventually closing a net 6 better at 476p on
turnover of 3.3m. Even heavier activity was noted in the Hong
Kong-registered shares, which put on 3 to 466p. More than 5m of the
overseas-registered shares changed hands, including a block of 4.5m shares
traded for cash at 460p a share. Standard Chartered rose 7 to 535p.
General Accident, regarded as the composite insurer with the largest
exposure to the US, retreated 6 to 543p after sustained selling pressure in
the wake of the floods and storms affecting the east coast of the US.
Guardian Royal edged up 3 to 173p, shrugging aside the Standard &amp; Poor's
warning on Guardian's life business rating.
Willis Corroon added 7 at 185p following news of the recent US buying
activity which saw Morgan Guaranty Trust acquire a further 1.5 per cent of
the shares, taking the stake up to 27.19 per cent.
Cable and Wireless, weakened in recent sessions by the worries surrounding
Hong Kong, staged a determined rally, with small bouts of institutional
buying uncovering a stock shortage. The shares closed 20 higher at 667p on
low turnover of 2.4m.
The week-long upsurge in Tadpole Technology shares continued at the outset,
with the stock boosted to over 230p initially. However, the first serious
wave of selling pressure saw the shares plummet to end another day of heavy
activity a net 15 off at 179p.
Several of the City's biggest institutions emerged as big buyers of the
stock over the past sessions.
The announcement that Fisons has agreed to sell its UK consumer health
business to Roche Holding for Pounds 90m did little for the shares. The
stock ended a net 2 firmer at 212p.
Reuters Holdings were 31p lower at one stage because of a press article
critical of Globex, Reuters' automated dealing system. The shares rallied to
close 18 off at 1331p.
Marketing services group WPP was steady at 43p ahead of a forecast cut and
downgrade by agency broker James Capel. The house has moved the stock to a
sell and reduced it 1992 forecast to Pounds 13m from Pounds 30m because of
exceptional costs.
Leisure conglomerate Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, rose 7 to 381p
as it was announced that Prudential had been buying shares and now has a 3
per cent stake.
Rumblings that independent broking house Cazenove had raised forecasts for
Dorling Kindersley helped the international publishing group. The stock put
on 10 to 255p.
Smiths Industries moved ahead 8 to 349p, with Kleinwort Benson said to have
shown a keen interest in the stock. One suggestion was that Smiths might be
interested in Vicker's medical division. Vickers firmed 3 to 92p.
Securities house BZW was reported to have reduced its current year profits
forecast for TI Group, by Pounds 20m to Pounds 130m. The shares responded by
falling 6 to 278p.
A recommendation from County NatWest helped Glynwed International gain 5 to
233p.
In the other industrials sector, English China Clays fell 11 to 415p in thin
trading, with Smith New Court reported to have joined other brokers in
downgrading current year profits estimates.
Confirmation of an 11 per cent increase in the dividend to 4.9p at Tiphook,
as it reported a well flagged set of interim results showing a 10.2 per cent
decline in profits, cheered the market. The shares advanced 10 to 294p.
Last week's stock overhang in P &amp; O and Associated British Ports appeared to
have been cleared in both cases. The former added 5 at 459p in trade of 1.2m
shares and the latter put on 7 to 330p.

FT  15 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares steady as trading volume falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market settled down for its pre-Christmas run yesterday,
when share prices moved within a narrow range in reduced trading volume. The
new equity trading account, extended to cover the Christmas holiday break,
takes the market up to the year-end, and investors showed little inclination
to chase prices any higher in the final weeks of 1992.
The outcome of the European Community summit meeting in Edinburgh last
weekend was received favourably but without any great enthusiasm. Some
renewed profit-taking selling at the opening of the session was checked by
initial firmnness in stock index futures, but even this optimistic signal
soon faded away.
The FT-SE Index dipped 6.4 to 2,709.8 in early trading but quickly turned
higher when the December contract on the Footsie made a firm start in the
stock index sector. The index moved up sharply, reaching the day's high of
2,726.1 within half-an-hour. Then the enthusiasm in the futures sector
melted away and equities spent the rest of the trading session 'quiet but
firm'.
An early gain of 9 Dow points on Wall Street found only a cautious response
in London. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,721.8 for an
improvement on the day of 5.6 points. Confidence in any further lasting
advance in equities this year appeared to be fading yesterday as City
institutions turned their attention to portfolio-dressing operations ahead
of the year-end. Credit Lyonnais Laing, the London-based securities house,
reiterated its view that the Footsie will finish the year at 2,700, but
forecast a 1993 year-end of 3,100.
Seaq-reported trading volume was down to 438.4m shares from Friday's 692.7m;
on Friday, retail or customer business volume, at Pounds 1.40bn, remained
well in the higher range of turnover recorded over the past two months. But
the fall in Seaq volume yesterday suggested that genuine investment activity
has begun to die away ahead of the market's Christmas break, which this year
will effectively extend over two weeks
However, there was some caution expressed yesterday that the stock market
could react sharply to this week's list of economic data which opens this
morning with the UK producer price statistics.
Last weekend brought hints of impending widespread workforce redundancies
across Europe by leading car makers and there were new hints in the City of
London yesterday of similar cutbacks in the securities trading industry.
This week will also bring a survey of business opinion from the
Confederation of British Industry and the latest data on domestic money
supply; neither are expected to bring much comfort for investors, although
both will be examined eagerly for indications of the economic recovery on
which the stock market is pinning its faith.
With sterling quiet on the foreign exchange markets, the blue chip
international stocks lacked a general trend, and movements among the
pharmaceuticals resulted in just a handful of irregular price changes.
Retail issues, now approaching the Christmas selling season which provides
the bulk of the year's profits, held firm but buyers were cautious and very
selective.

FT  15 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in stock index futures reported a dull day with most activity
centred on rolling positions forward from the December contract ahead of its
expiry next Friday, and into the March contract, writes Joel Kibazo.
In its last week of trading, the December contract on the FT-SE started
strongly at 2,736, a big premium to the underlying cash market. But that
large premium soon faded as two leading traders turned sellers and December
slipped, falling to the day's low of 2,715 at around 10.30am.
Trading then settled in a narrow range of 2,715 to 2,720 for the next four
hours until a firm Wall Street led to renewed buying, sending the contract
forward once again. Most of the day's activity consisted of dealers rolling
forward into the March contract.
December finished at 2,731, 4 up from Friday's close and at a 10-point
premium to the underlying cash market. Fair value has fallen to zero ahead
of the contracts expiry on Friday. Turnover in December reached 8,663 lots,
while the March contract saw volume of around 3,800 contracts.
Volume in the traded options was poor, reaching only 16,634 contracts by the
close, with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for 7,283 contracts of that
total. Hillsdown was the most actively dealt stock option. It had 1,959 lots
traded, and was followed by Scottish Power on 800 contracts.

D-Mark last Friday, but the currency weakened in the European afternoon amid
rumours that the Bundesbank will not support the franc with the vigour
deployed in the autumn, writes James Blitz.
In early European trading the D-Mark displayed weakness against other
currencies. Dealers were impressed by the results of the summit of European
leaders in Edinburgh, in particular the agreement on a Community budget and
Denmark's decision to hold a second referendum on European Monetary Union in
the summer.
The French franc consequently appreciated to a high of FFr3.3970 against the
D-Mark in the morning, having closed in Europe on Friday night at FFr3.4180.
Sterling also benefited from the news from Edinburgh, peaking in the morning
at DM2.4652 after finishing on Friday at DM2.4575.
In the afternoon, however, the franc's strength was sapped by rumours that
the Bundesbank had told the French authorities that there would be a limit
in future on the amounts they would spend supporting the French currency.
That rumour was not confirmed, but the currency closed at FFr3.4110 against
the D-Mark.
The net effect of yesterday's moves was to remove some of the stress that
had plagued the system last week. The Danish krone closed at DKr3.8525 to
the D-Mark, having been as low as DKr2.8950 the previous week. This came in
spite of a cut in Denmark's Certificate of Deposit interest rates from 15
per cent to 14 per cent yesterday.
Analysts believe that the French franc may only be enjoying a reprieve
because of the unwillingness of traders to take open positions in the run-up
to the new year. Mr David Cocker, an economist at Chemical Bank in London,
says the franc is suffering from large-scale hedging by investment funds who
are not selling assets but protecting their equities by restructuring their
currency portfolios.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, is moving towards
thinking that a French franc devaluation may happen. But he still thinks the
French and German authorities will avoid it, 'fighting a devaluation tooth
and nail'.
Mr Hannah believes three factors will melt the Bundesbank's icy
unwillingness to ease policy.
First, prospects of a German recession are worsening, with the Ifo institute
yesterday predicting a fall in German GDP of 0.5 per cent next year.
Secondly, German unions seem to be settling for wage rises that translate to
nil per cent in real terms. And, he feels, falling business activity will
trigger a decline in M3 money supply next year, with M3 dropping to the
lower end of the Bundesbank's new target range.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Money Markets: French futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY futures through-out Europe fell back sharply yesterday as dealers
had mixed feelings over the outcome of the European Community's weekend
summit in Edinburgh. Some dealers felt that it had failed to ease tension on
the foreign exchanges, writes James Blitz.
There may have been little reason to believe that EC leaders would come up
with a plan to ease European interest rates or tensions in the exchange rate
mechanism. However, dealers had got it into their heads that such moves were
possible, and were consequently disappointed at the result.
The March French franc contract was worst hit, falling 40 basis points to a
low of 90.68. This assumes that three-month money will be at 9.32 per cent
in the spring, a high level considering that the Bank of France's
intervention rate is at 9.10 per cent.
In spite of the Edinburgh accords on the EC budget and the Danish
referendum, the view of one dealer yesterday was that the French franc
'remains firmly in the melting pot'. With no cut in the Bundesbank's
official interest rates, dealers believe pressure on the franc will remain
intense into the new year.
Three-month French francs were yesterday quoted at between 11 1/4 per cent
and 10 7/8 per cent, a very high level considering that France appears on
the verge of recession. With one-year money trading at 9 1/2 per cent, the
sloping yield curve suggests that the market believes a cut in official
interest rates is inevitable sooner or later.
Euromark futures also fell back yesterday on disappointment over the events
in Edinburgh. The March contract declined 8 basis points to a close of
91.92.
German call money rates were steady at around 8.90-9.00 per cent yesterday
and dealers expected them to remain high this week as demand rises in line
with December tax payments.
The sterling cash market stayed calm. Three-month money ended marginally
firmer at around 7 3/16 per cent, from 7 1/8 per cent previously. This
partly reflected the pan-European disappointment on German rates. But there
is uncertainty over the shortages that the Bank of England will declare this
week. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m yesterday and
Pounds 10m of late assistance was provided.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lifeline thrown to Welsh cockle
gatherers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of closure hanging over one of Wales's most ancient industries
appears to have been removed.
The cockle gatherers of Penclawdd had feared that new EC hygiene directives,
due to come into force on January 1, would effectively put them out of
business, summarily ending their centuries-old trade.
But the government now seems to have thrown them a lifeline, at least until
September. 'I understand the local authorities have been advised by the
department of health to allow current practices to continue until next
gathering season beginning in autumn 1993,' according to the ministry of
agriculture.
Supporters of the cocklers, like Mr Gareth Wardell, Labour MP for Gower,
contend that the government's slowness to react to the consequences of the
directives was largely responsible for the industry's problems in the first
place.
In parliament earlier this month, Mr Wardell accused Mr David Curry,
agriculture minister, of sounding 'the death knell' of the industry through
his incompetence.
The department of agriculture had delayed for more than a year after the
directives had been approved before applying for a process for heat treating
molluscs and gastropods to be cleared by the European veterinary committee,
Mr Wardell claimed.
As a result, the industry had been unable to arrange for the requisite
treatment plant to be installed. Although the process - known as the Torry
process - had now been approved, this did not give enough time to act before
the directives came into force.
Mr Curry retorted by saying the regulations would be applied 'with common
sense' and promising: 'Nobody will be closed down on 1 January or 2
January'.
According to the ministry of agriculture, the application for approval of
the Torry process was submitted to the EC 'in the permissible time limit'.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambia prepares for copper
privatisation - The government's efforts to revive a vital sector of the
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MATHIAS Mpande, Zambia's deputy minister of mines, Mr Ed Shamutete, chief
executive of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the state company that runs
the copper industry, and Mr Francis Kunda, President of the Mineworkers
Union of Zambia, all have one thing in common: in their younger days, they
worked together underground at the Nkana mine on the copperbelt.
The symbolism of this unusual unity between labour, managers and state is
appropriate, Mr Mpande insists, because they all have similar views about
what is best for the industry. Certainly, they are united on one important
point of departure: the accession to power of the Chiluba government - in
November 1991 - has been the catalyst for a major turnaround in fortunes of
the industry.
From a production and financial nadir in 1991-92, when output of 387,000
tonnes yielded profits of only Dollars 30.5m, ZCCM looks set to recover in
1992-93, achieving production close to 450,000 tonnes and profits in the
region of Dollars 200m.
If the wheel is turning on the production side, this is no less true in
terms of the control of the industry. One of the main issues facing the
Chiluba government is whether, when and how to proceed with the
privatisation of ZCCM. The chances are good that these questions will be
addressed in 1993, with few betting against Anglo American Corporation,
South Africa's largest mining house, re-establishing its dominant position
on the copperbelt.
Copper has long been the jewel in Zambia's crown. It earns more than 90 per
cent of the country's foreign exchange earnings and has been, historically,
a very important contributor to the state's tax revenues. In 1991 the
corporation's production placed Zambia fourth among market-economies in
terms of mined copper production and sixth as a producer of refined copper.
By the end of the 1980s, however, 20 years of nationalised control of the
industry had taken its toll and copper had become an increasingly tarnished
jewel in a very shabby crown.
When the Chiluba government took over in November 1991, installing new
management at ZCCM, the corporation was in serious financial trouble. Debts
to overseas suppliers had reached the point where those companies stopped
selling to ZCCM.
Production problems - the 1992 annual report is awash with references to
'plant breakdowns', 'equipment outages' and shortages of spares and supplies
 -were the direct outcome of financial difficulties. These, in turn,
resulted from the government's increasing failure, over a number of years,
to invest in the core activity of metals production. From the time of
nationalisation in 1970, with the government also taking over management
control in 1974, the copper industry was increasingly saddled with
extraneous government investments in areas such as tourism, buses, jewellery
and dry-cleaning.
These businesses were a drain on resources and management time. To make
matters worse Zambia's deteriorating financial position through the 1980s
caused disbursements of foreign exchange to ZCCM to become ever more erratic
as the government succumbed to pressure to divert resources to other areas
of the economy. Mr Shamutete notes that whereas the company should have been
reinvesting at the rate of about 25 cents per lb of copper produced, it was
only achieving a rate of about 16-18 cents per lb.
The past year has seen a considerable improvement in the fortunes of ZCCM.
Good luck has played a part. The relatively high price of copper, a spike in
the cobalt price following unrest in Zaire (the two countries together
dominate the world market) and problems at the South African producer
Palabora have all been extraneous events from which ZCCM has benefited.
The main reasons for the turnround, however, lie with the new government,
which realised that the national interest was best served by a flourishing
ZCCM and set about creating a conducive environment. Indeed, Mr Mpande sees
his main task as minister being the restoration of ZCCM to profitability
through privatisation. Apart from offering critical political support, the
government has provided consistent and adequate foreign exchange
allocations, which have allowed ZCCM to minimise unnecessary equipment
failures. It has also given the corporation the mandate to return to its
core businesses - the peripheral activities will, in time, be privatised or
closed - and has upheld its commitment not to interfere in the running of
the business.
The benefits of these changes are beginning to filter through. With
increased production and a trimming of the labour force - the full
complement will have been cut by 10,000 to 46,000 by June 1993 - unit costs
have improved dramatically. The cost at mine (before debt servicing, tax,
depreciation and capital expenditure) in the first seven months of 1992-93
averaged 60.3 US cents a lb, down from 73.5 cents in 1991-92.
Although the corporation is now on a more even keel problems remain to be
faced in the future. While Mr Shamutete says the company has the financial
means to meet normal investment needs for the next five years the question
of what happens after that is a pressing one. Production at the Nchanga Open
Pit, the largest producer in the group, will start to tail off in seven to
eight years' time. If the corporation is to ensure that its production stays
in the 450,000 to 500,000-tonnes-a-year range into the next century a
decision on a replacement source of tonnage is urgent - possibly within the
next six months.
The source of this tonnage is no secret - the Konkola deep project, in the
north of the copperbelt, with reserves of about 355m tonnes and a mill
head-grade of 3.5 to 3.6 per cent copper. A feasibility study has suggested
that within six years the mine, which will cost about Dollars 550m, could be
producing at full capacity of 6m tonnes of ore a year. Mr Shamutete is
confident that a decision to go ahead with the project can be reached soon.
A separate but related issue concerns the privatisation of ZCCM. Although
there are misgivings in certain quarters about selling off the family
jewels, the balance of opinion clearly favours privatisation. The government
knows that failure to privatise ZCCM would shatter its hard-won economic
credibility. Prospects for further multilateral and bilateral aid would
probably also be damaged. The shape privatisation will take, however, is
unresolved, and this is clearly relevant to the development of Konkola.
The World Bank will be undertaking a study of ZCCM during the first quarter
of 1993 from which an action plan for privatisation will emerge. The main
issue to be resolved is whether the corporation will be sold off as one unit
or broken up into smaller operations (there are six operating divisions). Mr
Mpande says he favours breaking the company up as this will foster
competition from which Zambia should benefit. He also says that he takes it
for granted that Anglo American will return to the position where it has
management control over a significant portion of the industry.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price rallies after dipping
to Dollars 17.85 a barrel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLATILE OIL prices edged higher in late trading yesterday after opening the
day on a weak note as the market struggled to find a new direction.
North Sea Brent crude for February delivery touched Dollars 17.85 a barrel
in thin morning trading. But later in the day, a stronger New York market
pushed London prices higher to Dollars 18.05 a barrel - 15 cents lower than
Friday's close.
'The market is still in the mood to be bearish, but it has stopped
reinterpreting everything as bad news,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw, industry
consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
Traders are still looking for evidence in the market that members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries are restraining their
production of oil. Iran yesterday stressed that it had cut 300,000 barrels a
day from its output.
Iran has been shaken by the recent drop in oil prices which have fallen by
Dollars 3 a barrel since October, and yesterday issued a statement
reiterating its offer to cut below its latest production allocation. The
statement, issued to Reuters news agency, called on Opec members to consider
further ways of strengthening the market.
However, some market observers believe prices have gone down too far: 'The
market has oversold and overreacted,' said Mr Ken Miller, at Purvin and
Gertz, the oil analysis group, in Houston, Texas. Mr Miller believes the
market is fairly well balanced without a great overhang of stocks. He
expects demand for Opec oil to reach 24.7m b/d in the first quarter
(excluding Ecuador) - roughly in line with Opec's new production ceiling of
24.58m b/d.
The weak market for oil products in the US could improve over the next month
as some refineries cut their production runs in response to slim profit
margins. Mr Miller expects this to bring some strength back to the crude
market early next year.

London Metal Exchange base metals ended mixed in mostly routine trading. The
sharpest movements were a Dollars 70-a-tonne rise in cash NICKEL, which
traders said was capitalising on the presence of downside support, increased
physical interest in the US and short covering, and a Dollars 13-a-tonne
fall in cash ZINC, influenced by technical liquidation following Chinese
sales. ALUMINIUM met overhead resistance above Dollars 1,230 a tonne for
three months delivery and the price closed at Dollars 1,219.50 a tonne, down
Dollars 9 on the day. COPPER prices remained below their early highs, with
resistance above Dollars 2,220 a tonne for three months metal proving a
stiff barrier to upside moves once short covering and Chinese buying was
absorbed. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA futures continued
on their recent downtrend and closed with losses of up to Pounds 11 a tonne.
'Nobody is really prepared to invest heavily on the short side,' one dealer
commented. Robusta COFFEE prices ended higher but below earlier 13-month
peaks.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm ministers resist plan to
drop currency cushion
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers yesterday resisted European
Commission plans to do away with the community's mechanism for cushioning
farmers against currency fluctuations.
The clear majority against abolishing the so-called 'switchover' system was
an early augury of what is likely to be a long list of demands from the farm
sector to ameliorate the effects of the reform of the common agricultural
policy and as compensation for last month's EC-US deal on subsidised food
exports within the Uruguay Round world trade talks.
This week's farm council, originally to have been two days, has already
formally been extended to three days, and could run to five - and risks
being transformed into a bazaar.
The biggest ticket item in the horse-trading is 'switchover', which will
almost certainly be retained once the system of monetary compensatory
amounts is abolished on January 1, when the Single European Market comes
into effect.
Commission agriculture officials calculate that the currency turbulence of
the past six months alone could cost the farm budget - Ecu35.3bn (Pounds
28bn) this year - an extra Ecu1.6bn.
The conclusions of the weekend's Edinburgh summit of EC leaders agreed that
'appropriate steps' could be taken to compensate for monetary realignments,
but left unclear whether any new money would come from the EC or national
budgets. The CAP-linked monetary reserve to compensate currency movements
was also retained at Ecu1bn for the next two years, whereas the original
plan had been to cut it much faster and beef up contingency reserves to
underpin EC external policy.
There is no clear picture of where the bulk of any additional spending would
go, but France would almost certainly be a significant beneficiary. France
is anxious to get concessions to wave in front of its farmers, who are in
near revolt over the Uruguay Round deal. It is also after more money for
beef, durum wheat (for pasta) and wine producers.
Italy will again try this week to get retrospectively revalidated about a
third of its illicit surplus milk production. And Ireland is looking for
concessions for its livestock sector.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (10): A
story of little change - Obstacles to concentration among savings banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IN SPITE of generous fiscal encouragement, our banking system has shown
scarce propensity to concentration. This might lead one to believe that
directors' personal prospects have in some cases prevailed over the
interests of the banks' owners,' Mr Guido Carli told the Italian banking
association ABI earlier this year.
Mr Carli, former governor of the Bank of Italy and treasury minister,
probably had the casse di risparmio (savings banks) in mind. The Amato-
Carli Law, enacted in July 1990, aimed at a radical reorganisation of
Italian banking's large public sector.
However, mergers between casse have not occurred, despite exhortations from
the central bank. Three years ago there were 75 casse and seven monti di
credito, which are included in the savings bank category. At 80 today, the
total has changed little.
Savings banks have 29 per cent of deposits in the Italian banking system and
24 per cent of lending. But most casse are small. The 10 largest together
have about 2,200 branches. The others have networks with an average of about
35 branches.
'The Bank of Italy's encouragement of mergers has encountered resistance,'
admits Mr Edoardo Fattorini, general manager of the savings banks'
association, Acri. But he says that the authorities are right in aiming for
a banking system with larger banks as small institutions are unable to
provide the range of services and financial products that customers demand.
What strategies are therefore open to the large number of small casse?
Takeovers and mergers are the obvious path to competitive size. But there
have only been a handful. Five years ago the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma took
over the Molisana savings bank after this had run into difficulties. Two
years later the Cassa di Risparmio di Verona Vicenza e Belluno acquired the
troubled Ancona savings bank.
Mergers are now in prospect between the casse of Parma and Piacenza, and
those of Pesaro and Fano.
Diffident towards mergers, Italy's casse are trying two other forms of
togetherness. 'One is the creation of holdings. The other is the acquisition
of minority stakes by large casse in smaller institutions,' explains Mr
Fattorini. Both have been made possible by the Amato-Carli Law, which
allowed the casse to spin off their banking operations into separate joint
stock corporations from the parent foundations or associations.
The first holding was established by seven Tuscan casse and monte di credito
at the end of last year, bringing into a single organisation some
activities, such as data processing, training and import/export services,
that were previously undertaken independently. A second holding, the Gruppo
Bancario Casse Emiliano Romagnole, was formed in July. This links six
institutions in Emilia Romagna and has the task of co-ordinating, directing
and developing unified strategies in various operating sectors of the
constituent banks.
In the acquisition of minority stakes, the trail is being blazed by the
Gruppo Cassa di Risparmio di Roma, which controls Banca di Roma, and by
Italy's biggest savings bank, Cariplo. Milan-based Cariplo already has
equity interests in 12 casse in central and southern Italy. 'In this form of
concentration, the large cassa provides the sophisticated services and
products that are beyond the capacity of its smaller partners,' explains Mr
Roberto Mazzotta, Cariplo's chairman.
When reorganisation of Italy's savings banks became a talking point in the
second half of the 1980s, there was concern among the small casse that they
would be swallowed by Cariplo and the large institutions. Mr Mazzotta,
chairman of Acri as well as Cariplo, has tried to calm these fears,
emphasising the importance of maintaining local identities.
'There is no reason why small and medium-sized casse should disappear. They
have very strong links with their areas of operation, particularly with
local bodies, small businesses and the family sector,' he says. It is not
unusual for a cassa to hold more than 50 per cent of its local market.
They have had many years in which to carve out their shares. The monti di
credito were established in the 15th century to combat usury, providing
loans to the poor against assets deposited as pledges. The casse are more
recent. The first were set up in the 19th century in northern Italy by the
Austrians.
Perhaps their deep local roots have contributed to the casse's reputation
for highly politicised boardrooms. Mr Mazzotta explains that mem- bers of
the boards of the found- ations or associations that control the banking
joint stock corporations are appointed by local governments.
Chairmen are appointed by the CICR interministerial committee for credit and
savings, though there will be a referendum next spring to abrogate the law
which empowers central government to appoint savings banks' chairmen. 'It
seems certain to be approved by the electorate, thereby returning the power
of appointment to local authorities,' says Mr Mazzotta, adding that this
will enhance local autonomy.
It is easy to understand why politicians should be so inter- ested in these
levers of power. There are recent cases of casse running into difficulties
because of politically-directed lending. Bank of Italy statistics show that
the savings banks have worse default figures than other categories (6.1 per
cent of lending against 5.1 per cent for the system overall).
But Mr Fattorini says that there are reasons for this. The close ties to the
family sector have led to higher provisions against consumer credit
activity. Also, the casse are more rigorous in classifying their
non-performing loans.
Political interest in appointments to the banks' boards is, however,
probably as much in profit distribution as lending management. Before the
Amato-Carli Law, the casse retained part of profits for capital reinforement
and distributed part in beneficence. Little has changed. The new foundations
and associations obtain dividends from the banking joint stock corpor-
ations and use these for charity and good works, giving scope for tending
local political constituencies.
There has been speculation about public offers of shares in the casse.
Indeed, Mr Mazzotta hopes that there will be widespread share ownership with
involvement by instit- utional investors. But Acri's chairman would not like
to see the existing control disappear. 'There should be no takeovers.
Stability should be guaranteed by the foundations and associations.'
However, some people believe a real shake-up is needed, rather than
stability.
Mr Mazzotta talks of arriving at three or four large groups in the next five
years. But in making retention of local character the main priority, and in
satisfying the politicians' appetite for boardroom power, Italy's casse have
dodged the reorganisation issue.
One hundred years ago Italy had 200 savings banks. Their number was sharply
reduced by legislation in 1926 which made mergers obligatory. Perhaps Mr
Carli should have included a similar measure in the Amato-Carli Law.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (9): A
bankable professor / Profile of Tancredi Bianchi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE last door of a long corridor at Milan's Bocconi University is hardly the
most obvious place to find the man now gently steering Italy's banks at a
time of unprecedented change.
But the surroundings fit the character of Mr Tancredi Bianchi, the professor
of banking economics at Italy's most distinguished university, who was last
year's surprise choice to chair the Associazione Bancaria Italiana, Italy's
bankers' federation.
ABI is the mouthpiece for all Italy's banks. Sometimes, as in the early 1991
collapse of the Federconsorzi farm services group, it comes out of the
shadows to play a central role in a financial drama by representing the
entire system in talks with the government and foreign counterparts.
At other times, ABI keeps to the sidelines, providing detailed information
to help member banks make better strategic decisions on broad macroeconomic
issues or on specialised banking matters.
Mr Bianchi, a Bocconi graduate who has been teaching at his Alma Mater for
the past 13 years, prefers the second approach. Instantly recognisable for
his shock of grey hair, his clipped, precise sentences are a long shot from
the verbiage of some colleagues.
'I was born a university professor,' he says, somewhat diffidently. But Mr
Bianchi is no wallflower when it comes to defending the Italian banking
system. True, the country's banks still have a reputation for inefficiency,
small networks and a negligible presence abroad, which put them in the
shadow of bigger European rivals.
But many of those characteristics are legacies of rules made years ago,
rather than inherent faults in the banks themselves, he emph- asises.
Attacks on inadequate internationalisation are unfair, he insists. Only in
1990 did Italy finally allow the free movement of capital. 'Swiss banks
could tell you all about investing in Australian shares or New Zealand
bonds: at an Italian bank, such knowledge was useless.'
Likewise, the very strict controls on branching imposed by the Bank of Italy
until the beginning of the 1990s prevented banks from developing big
networks. 'Now things are moving, but the problem is that banks have only
two ways to grow; either organically, which is slow; or through
acquisitions, which is expensive.'
Yet on the positive side, Mr Bianchi points out that Italy's banks are
relatively profitable - even if largely due to limited foreign competition -
and relatively well capitalised.
He prefers to talk of 'restructuring', rather than 'rationalising' the
banking system to create fewer, bigger banks able to take on the best in
Europe. It is a small, but significant, nuance at a time when many medium
and smaller banks are uneasy about their fates.
The Amato law on bank mergers of the late 1980s, which accelerated the pace
of change by offering tax advantages to banks changing their status into
that of joint stock companies or merging, has had some effect. 'Along with
the European Community's Second Banking Directive, which will prepare the
way for universal banking in Italy, such changes will provide the backdrop
which could encourage a major leap,' Mr Bianchi says. 'But we still need a
few years.'
It is the need for additional funds which will provide the biggest push for
change as more banks tap private sector capital, he predicts. Hence
privatisation of public sector banks, which currently comprise around
three-quarters of the system, is less an ideological issue for Mr Bianchi
than one of pure practicality. 'It's not that the public sector is
inappropriate as a partner in the banking system. Rather, the state is no
longer in a position to provide funds.'
This year may go down as paving the way for the greatest change. While
January brought the flotation of an opening stake in Istituto Bancario San
Paolo di Torino, 1992 should close with preliminary steps to privatise a
number of state-owned institutions, starting with Credito Italiano.
'Restructuring requires additional capital, so there is no doubt the role of
private investors will grow,' says Mr Bianchi.
Looking ahead, he sees four or five really big Italian banks emerging by the
end of the century. Together, they will account for around half the banking
system in terms of assets. Two - San Paolo and the new Banca di Roma - have
already surfaced. Cariplo, the big Milan-based savings bank which could buy
the IMI financial services group, looks like the third. Finding the names
for the fourth and fifth is more tricky, but Mr Bianchi points to Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro - alone or with a partner - and possibly Monte dei
Paschi di Siena as the most likely candidates.
The next level down will comprise banks which are still substantial in size,
but whose main focus will be on retail banking, rather than all services, he
believes. And there will still be a substantial role for the
municipally-owned savings banks, which currently account for around 30 per
cent of the Italian banking system.
Rather than remaining locked in their current positions owing to political
or regional rivalries, Mr Bianchi expects the savings banks to form bigger
units through mergers and takeovers. 'There is already some movement,' he
says. 'Some are merging, while in other cases, bigger counterparts such as
Cariplo and Banca di Roma are taking minority stakes.' Like most observers,
he expects those minority participations to become majorities in the end.
In the meantime, more banks will have to decide on their own internal
structures. Though most have traditionally adopted the so-called
'polyfunctional' model, involving a holding company and subsidiaries for
specialised functions such as merchant banking or leasing, the concept of
the universal bank is gaining ground.
In the past, the issue has sometimes been decided on fiscal grounds, with
banks seeking to reduce their tax bills by choosing the most fitting
structure. 'If the choice were fiscally neutral, then banks could make the
choice on purely organisational grounds,' he says.
However, Mr Bianchi doubts that any model will prevail. 'It's not a question
of winners or losers,' he says. Rather, banks such as Banca Commerciale
Italiana, which have tended to grow up along the 'polyfunctional' path, will
probably carry on that way, while others, such as Cariplo, with few
subsidiaries, will probably develop their banking activities under one
corporate roof.
And what of ABI in the meantime? The role of a bankers' association is to
help identify the parameters that might influence important decisions for
members. 'Our scope is to study banks' problems. We are here to point out
possible solutions, not to find answers or give orders. It's up to the banks
themselves to decide on how to implement that advice.'
Mr Bianchi is now two-thirds the way through his second year at ABI. Its
rules allow the chairman up to four renewable two-year terms. 'No one stays
for eight years,' he says. With a queue of students outside his door waiting
for advice from their professor-turned-practitioner, he would clearly not be
opposed to a second term. 'But that is up to the members.'

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (7): Slide
in lira will lead to casualties - Finance for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Guiliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, intervened in October to
chivvy banks for not cutting their interest rates fast enough after the
previous month's currency turmoil, which had seen rates hit near-record
levels, it was clear that finance for industry had become a key issue.
Since then, a chorus of bankers and businessmen have given their views on
whether the financial system is responsive enough to the needs of industry,
while the state-dominated banking system has toed the line and eased down
borrowing levels.
The debate on corporate lending is by no means over, however. In late
October, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, took
what many economists saw as the significant step of directly requesting the
country's banks to limit their future lira lending to domestic customers.
Under the Bank of Italy's demand for monthly details of new lending growth,
banks were requested to keep credits to within precisely observed percentage
limits of base levels set from the January-March period this year. Loans
could go up by 3 per cent in November, 8 per cent in December and by either
7 per cent or 8 per cent monthly until March, when presumably the central
bank will reassess the situation.
The Bank of Italy's decision, which for some economists is an unwelcome echo
of the regimented 1970s and 1980s when lending was strictly controlled, was
purely a matter of 'moral suasion'. The central bank gave no hint of
penalties for banks which exceeded its suggested limits. But in Italy's
docile banking market, it is unlikely that bankers will fail to toe the
line.
As matters stand, corporate borrowers in Italy are faced with an astonishing
array of choice when it comes to picking a possible lender. One reason for
the multiplicity of sources are the laws introduced after the 1930s
depression which divide corporate lending into two main categories.
Under the regulations, now fraying at the edges, commercial banks are
limited to what the Bank of Italy calls 'short-term' lending - meaning up to
18 months. The banks can also make a limited number of loans for longer
periods of up to five years. The precise amount depends on their total
shareholders' funds, but the lion's share of corporate credits is of the
'short term' variety.
By contrast, medium to long-term lending - defined as being for periods up
to 20 years - is the domain of a special group of 11 regional medium- term
credit institutions.
Such institutions specialise in structural loans for industry to finance
major investments such as new plants, as well as mortgages on commercial
property. The medium-term banks are owned by commercial banks in the region,
along with municipal and regional authorities.
The 11 are supplemented by two special institutions, Mediobanca and Istituto
Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), which combine medium to long-term loans, usually
reserved for Italy's blue-chip customers, with a variety of other financial
services including investment banking and corporate finance.
But there is less to the division of responsibilities than meets the eye.
With agreed overdraft facilities forming the most popular instrument for
industrial finance, companies commonly use rolled-over overdrafts,
theoretically limited to 12 months, as a much longer-term form of credit.
'It is a distortion of the system, but short-term lending tends to be used
even for companies' medium and long-term financing needs,' says one banker.
'With a plethora of banking relation- ships, companies have tended to turn
lots of separate overdrafts into one effective long-term loan.'
The head of marketing at a leading Italian bank explains: 'We examine a
company's overdraft facility once a year. But rolling it over is usually
just a formality provided the company's books are healthy.'
Such short-term facilities comprise around a third of the loan finance used
by Italian companies, according to figures from the Bank of Italy. The
remainder is divided almost equally between supplier credits and long-term
bank finance.
For many Italian companies, the prime source of finance is retained profits
rather than loans. Even in recession, the tradition of ploughing back
earnings into the business is firmly established. According to figures from
the central bank, around 45 per cent of company financing comes from
internal sources. The figure testifies to the structure of Italian industry,
with its plethora of small and medium- sized family-owned companies, which
still take pride in bankrolling their growth through retained profits.
By contrast, the limited role of the stock market emerges from the fact that
little over 200 companies are quoted. Last year, companies raised around
L11,000bn on the bourse - around a fifth of the L50,000bn to L60,000bn
provided in new money by the banking system.
Although the stock market is of little relevance in financing the corporate
sector, shares comprise a surprisingly high proportion of private savings.
That reflects the fact that, although few companies are quoted, many are
privately owned. Thus shares comprise around 17 per cent of private savings
in Italy - but only quarter of that total is composed of the equity of
quoted concerns.
Even finance from specialist institutions such as merchant banks has been on
the wane as a result of the lacklustre performance of the bourse -
exacerbated by this year's fall in share prices.
Many of the new Italian merchant banks which sprang up in the early 1980s
turned to investing in unquoted companies as an exciting new business. They
believed that while such companies could have immense product and market
know-how, they were often relatively unsophisticated when it came to
finance.
With the expected rise in cross-border takeovers from the liberalised
European market of the 1990s, many bankers believed such companies might
require their expertise in more specialised services such as corporate
finance and mergers and acquisition. Eventually, the target was to float the
companies - generating big profits for bankers and private family
shareholders alike.
That thinking reached a peak in the boom days of the bourse in 1986, when
Italian finance appeared to be undergoing a sea change with traditional
lending making way for risk capital and eventual flotation.
But after the downturn on the stock market and the onset of tougher trading
conditions for many smaller companies, many merchant bankers have found
themselves lumbered with minority stakes which they cannot now sell.
'They've ended up having to marry their clients for ever,' says one
economist.
Foreign currency loans, which currently account for around 1 per cent of
Italian companies' overall financing, has also turned out to be a mixed
blessing after the lira's recent slide.
The attractions of borrowing in low interest rate currencies such as the
D-Mark or dollar - the two most common - were obvious at a time of a firm
lira based on the Bank of Italy's policy of maintaining a strong currency
through high interest rates. Against the D-Mark in particular, the risk of
adverse exchange rate movements seemed virtually excluded thanks to the
lira's presence in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System, through which relatively high Italian interest rates sucked in large
amounts of foreign capital.
The devaluation of the lira has harshly spotlighted the fallacy of that
reasoning. Though relatively few Italian companies have borrowed abroad  -
and many have hedged their exposures - the slide in the lira will inevitably
cause some casualties in the sector when companies find their interest
payments have become astronomically higher in lira terms than before.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (8):
Maramotti, man behind the beacon of efficiency / Profile of Credito Emiliano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW entrepreneurs are better placed to speak on relations between banks and
industry than Mr Achille Maramotti, the self-made millionaire who has built
the family-owned Max Mara women's wear group into one of the most successful
international fashion names.
Mr Maramotti, 65, combines running his group with the vice-chairmanship of
Credito Emiliano, the regional bank which stands out as one of the most
progressive financial institutions in Italy.
Based, like Max Mara, in Reggio Emilia in northern Italy, it is notable for
slick customer services and a strong emphasis on marketing. These may be
nothing special for foreigners used to smooth-running domestic bank
counters, but in Italy, where at most banks the customer often seems to come
last, Credito Emiliano is a beacon of efficiency.
Often the distinguishing touches are minor. No other Italian bank produces
such clear and legible statements. Nor have any competitors woken up to its
practice - commonplace abroad - of having just one queue for all the teller
desks, reducing the risk of being stuck behind a slow customer.
'We have excellent management who comb the world for the latest ideas,' says
Mr Maramotti. 'We always wanted a bank which would be at the forefront of
developments in the industry.' At international banking exhibitions, where
new ideas in technology and customer services are on display, the Credito
Emiliano team is often the only Italian presence.
As the biggest single shareholder in the bank, which now has total group
assets of L6,400bn and made L28.3bn after tax last year, Mr Maramotti speaks
with some authority, While he controls only 27 per cent of the stock, a pact
with a rich Torinese family, the second biggest shareholder, and a handful
of other local businessmen gives the group control of the bank, which also
has about 4,000 small shareholders.
Mr Maramotti stresses he is primarily an industrialist, not a financier. 'I
am an industrialist who has developed a certain interest in banking,' he
says modestly. Day-to-day management is left to a team of professionals. 'I
look at this shareholding like one in any other company. But I'm not a
silent partner.'
Indeed, the deputy chairman clearly takes his job seriously, dividing his
time between the bank and Max Mara. That combination gives Mr Maramotti,
born and raised in Emilia Romagna, the Italian region synonymous with the
small and medium-sized businesses which form the country's economic
backbone, a special insight when it comes to talking about banks and
industry.
Unlike many competitors in clothing, who have regularly blamed excessive
interest rates and inefficient banking services for some at least of Italy's
economic ills, he does not think the relationship between bank and borrower
is unfairly tilted towards the lender.
'Generally speaking, I think the banking system works pretty well for
industry,' he says. 'The cost of money is high because the state, with its
huge borrowing needs, is the main competitor for funds. Colleagues who
complain about shortcomings in the banking system or high interest rates are
just looking for excuses. They should run their businesses better instead.'
However, Mr Maramotti admits to being atypical of the genre. The growth of
Max Mara, which now encompasses 16 lines and consolidated sales of L903bn
last year, has come largely from ploughing back profits into the business
over the years rather than borrowing money. 'My relationship with the
banking system is very anomalous,' he admits. 'Max Mara has never paid
dividends and we've always reinvested our earnings, so I tend to deposit
money rather than borrow it.'
But while no one doubts there is a bright future for unquoted, growing
companies such as Max Mara, where the founding family is still very much in
charge, what awaits medium-sized banks like Credito Emiliano, with limited
branch networks and only regional coverage?
Many banking analysts praise the deep local roots and close customer
contacts which give such banks their strength. But they are sceptical about
longer-term prospects in a European banking system moving steadily towards
consolidation and larger, multinational institutions.
Mr Maramotti is confident about Credito Emiliano's future. So much so that
he and his fellow shareholders recently pumped in fresh cash to support a
rights issue to finance its expansion.
Apart from opening more branches in its base region of Emilia Romagna,
growth has also taken it into new ground in southern Italy. Credito Emiliano
has bought a number of sometimes troubled banks in the south.
'As we see ourselves as innovative, we believed we could add bring something
new to the banking system in the south. We first looked at Appulia, an
economically vibrant region with a less crime-ridden image than some other
parts,' Mr Maramotti says. 'When we couldn't find what we wanted, we turned
to Sicily instead.'
The acquisitions, which have helped push up total branch numbers to 115 in
17 provinces, have now been cleaned up, he says. And the experience gained
in the south has left Credito Emiliano poised to make further acquisitions
there should the opportunity arise.
'We think there is a future for the bank,' he says. 'We have decided to
focus on the medium-upper segment of the market for deposits, while we see
smaller and medium-sized companies as our obvious clients for lending.' So
far, the strategy has worked.
A well-managed, profitable bank like Credito Emiliano is an obvious takeover
target, particularly for big foreign banks which are still keen to expand in
Italy. 'We hope we've already reached a size which will allow us to remain
independent. So we will turn down all offers,' says Mr Maramotti. 'And we
also believe the more we plough in to developing the company, the more it
will be worth in future.'
The bank's limited resources would prevent it from making a really big
takeover in the hundreds of billions of lire range. But smaller deals are by
no means excluded. 'There are lots of other shareholders like me ready to
invest in this company,' says Mr Maramotti confidently.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (6): 'It's
too early for bonds' - Why the market is likely to take some time to pick up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN bond market currently represents something of a conundrum for
investors.
International investors have been badly burnt by volatile market conditions,
including a currency devaluation, this year. Worse, they are still not at
all convinced that the structural problems facing the Italian economy will
be overcome. Many of them are biding their time before re-entering the
market, at least until they feel more confident about the stability of the
currency.
Yet Italy offers among the highest real rates of interest in Europe. At
current levels, the market may well prove to be oversold, and when the
German Bundesbank starts to cut interest rates, Italian bonds will be among
the beneficiaries.
Still, investor confidence is not yet close to being restored.
'Given the continuing tensions and strains within the exchange rate
mechanism, it is a bit early to consider moving back into Italian bonds,'
believes Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed interest at Gartmore, which sold
all its Italian bond holdings eight months ago.
Mr Ray Greenshields of AMP Asset Management says that he is watching the
market with interest 'but our fingers are not poised on the trigger.
'We need to have a lot more confidence in the fiscal and monetary management
of the country before we would go in as a physical investor'. He adds that
the use of options on the market has been consid- ered, but even that route
has been thought to be too risky.
One London-based securities firm, once fairly active in the market, no
longer has any clients holding Italian bonds, according to a trader there.
'We still trade on our own account, but there is no investor interest at
all,' he says.
The largest government bond market in Europe, and the third largest in the
world after the US and Japan, Italy is caught in a debt-trap.
Its public debt versus gross domestic product ratio, currently 103 per cent,
is set to rise further, unless the government manages to bring the budget
deficit under control.
There are signs that it has the will, but, even when the budget deficit
reduction programme is approved, it will still be hard to convince investors
that the policy will be rigidly imposed, given the country's history of
political instability.
But the Italian government's financing needs leave little room for
manoeuvre. Unlike the UK, Italy has not been able to benefit from its
withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism by drastically cutting interest
rates, because without high interest rates, it will not be able to fund its
deficit.
However, unless interest rates fall, servicing of the public debt will
continue to eat up a large part of government revenues.
Although Belgium has an even larger public debt relative to GDP, at 133 per
cent, analysts point out that, unlike Italy, Belgium's debt ratio is moving
in the right direction.
Nevertheless, Mr Giorgio Radaelli, an international economist at Lehman
Brothers, believes there is some room for optimism on the bond market's
prospects. 'In the long run, the outlook is for rates to move downwards,' he
says. He believes that the debt ratio will be stabilised and that European
economic union is still likely to go ahead, with Italy as a part of it.
He points out that, while Italy may not meet Maastricht targets on debt
levels, Belgium is not likely to either, and it is inconceivable for union
to take place without Belgium.
'Domestic investors are more bullish on Emu (than international investors),'
says Mr Radaelli.
From the Italian government's point of view, the continued goodwill of
domestic investors is vital. Despite a huge surge of international interest
in Italian bonds in recent years, international investors still account for
only 7 per cent of the market, mostly fixed-rate Buoni del Tesoro Poliennali
(BTPs).
International investors still have to pay withholding tax on Italian
government bonds (since the mechanism for reclaiming tax still fails to
function) so that 10-year bonds yield 12 per cent for international
investors, compared with 13.7 per cent for Italians.
Still, with inflation at just under 5 per cent, the rates would be
attractive, were it not for continued concern about the currency.
However, some fund managers are considering re-entering the bond market, but
fully hedging any currency risk. 'I think we will move back into Italian
bonds within the next six months,' says one London-based fund manager who
declined to be quoted. 'The market has had a tempestuous time and that has
made it much cheaper, compared with other European markets. The currency may
well devalue further, but that is not necessarily bad news for bonds, in
lira terms. So we would hedge out the currency risk.'
Some managers have also lost confidence in the liquidity of the market.
Despite its size, the market's volatility has made it one of the most
difficult to trade. When short-term interest rates shot up, positions taken
by dealers became very expensive to hold. As dealers found themselves losing
money on the market, they gradually stopped making prices and liquidity in
the cash market disappeared.
Some investors were not only unable to sell their bonds, they were not even
able to get prices. When prices were quoted, the market jumped in gaps of as
much as two points.
While stability has now returned to the market, investors and traders are
likely to maintain a wary stance for some time to come.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (5): Efim
upsets the bankers - The state's debt problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY IS fast acquiring a reputation as unreliable among international
bankers. The collapse of Federconsorzi, the farm services group, followed by
the ugly dispute over Efim, which went into voluntary liquidation in July
this year, have tarnished the country's reputation as a borrower.
The Efim affair remains unresolved as far as many bankers are concerned. Six
months after the state holding group - which controls about 140 companies
ranging from helicopter makers to glass manufacturers - collapsed, foreign
bankers still have not received any of the money that they are owed.
Privately, foreign banks warn that Italian state borrowers could find it
hard to raise money in the international syndicated loans market in future
unless they are prepared to pay handsome terms for the privilege.
Eighteen months ago, international banks clashed with the Italian
authorities over Federconsorzi, the farm services group which went under
with debts of L4,200bn.
International banks claimed that Federconsorzi had been able to borrow in
the syndicated loans market on relatively favourable terms because it was
regarded as a state credit to all intents and purposes. They were furious
when the Italian government refused to repay Federconsorzi's debts. Many -
including the Japanese banks which had a large exposure to Federconsorzi -
refused to lend to Italian names in protest.
When Italian borrowers were eventually able to return to the market, pricing
on their loans increased to reflect banks' concern over Italian credits.
However, few lessons seem to have been learnt from that affair. Efim was put
into liquidation by government decree on July 18 with total bank borrowings
of about L9,500bn, of which nearly L4,000bn is owed to foreign banks.
The Italian treasury announced shortly afterwards that creditors would be
issued bonds denominated in either Ecu or Lira and paying interest at only
about half the market rate - an offer worth about L4,000bn. The proposed
coupon on the Lira bonds was 7.25 per cent while that on the Ecu bonds was
set at 4 per cent.
The banks were furious at the miserly coupons, saying that the overall deal
was equivalent to only 80 per cent of the principal and interest due.
The creditor banks argue that Efim, and its subsidiaries Agusta and Safim,
were able to borrow in the international loans market on competitive terms.
Agusta and Safim were treated as state risks, even though there was no
explicit Treasury guarantee.
After several weeks of lobbying, the state eventually relented and agreed to
repay the debts in full. However, banks complain that they have had no
further details of how they will be repaid or when.
Under the terms of the latest decree, the Treasury will guarantee in full
those loans made to the failed holding company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, also in liquidation. However, foreign bankers remain uncertain
over the implications for loans made to those subsidiaries which are not
wholly-owned by Efim, such as the Agusta helicopters group.
The Italian government said in October that Efim's loss-making aerospace and
defence interests would be transferred to IRI (Italy's largest state holding
group) to be managed, pending their sale. These include Agusta and Oto
Melara, a missiles producer. The government has said it will take on the
debts owed by Agusta and Oto Melara.
The Efim debacle has coloured bankers' perceptions of Italian risk. Many
argue that the clumsy handling of its debt repayments could make bankers
reluctant to lend to other state-controlled names, such as IRI.
Certainly, Italian names have been frequent users of the international
syndicated loans market in the past. Total syndicated borrowing reached a
peak of Dollars 14.69bn in 1990, falling back to Dollars 8.03bn in 1991 and
a mere Dollars 4.95bn so far in 1992, according to figures provided by
Euromoney Loanware.
Bankers point out that several loans to IRI, ENI and ENEL, the state holding
companies, are due to mature in the next year or so. It could turn out to be
expensive and difficult to refinance these borrowings in the loans market.
The top state-owned borrowers, such as Ferrovie, the railway, and ENEL, the
electricity utility, have traditionally had easy access to a range of
financial markets - so if the syndicated loans market is closed off to them,
they can tap other markets such as the bond market instead. But small
financial institutions which have depended on the syndicated loan market in
the past could find other sources of funds difficult to obtain.
Bankers report that few Italian state borrowers are willing to approach the
syndicated loans market while the Efim affair drags on. Coming after the
Federconsorzi scandal, bankers are naturally even less willing to lend to
Italian state names at a time when the economic background in Italy appears
to be deteriorating.
Isveimer, the Italian credit institution, recently launched a Dollars 150m
floating rate note (FRN) issue, and bankers point out that the generous
terms of the deal reflect the need to overcome a general uneasiness about
Italian borrowers.
However, not all have been treated in this way. Fiat, Italy's largest
private industrial conglomerate, recently succeeded in raising the amount
borrowed via a five-year revolving credit facility to Dollars 800m from the
Dollars 500m it had originally planned. The pricing - of 55 basis points
over the London interbank offered rate - was seen as relatively aggressive.
Bankers point out Fiat is one Italian name that has not been damaged by the
Efim affair.
In many cases, however, bankers are waiting for the resolution of the affair
before they rush to lend to Italian names.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (3): Boom
with no end in sight - More than one bank branch opens every day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE bank network expansion was liberalised, with the easing of the central
bank's tight constraints in March 1990, branch blight has hit Italy. Opening
thousands of new branches in cities, towns and villages, commercial banks
have been aggressively seeking to expand their territories and increase
domestic market share.
Italy's 1,100 banks had a total of just under 15,600 bank branches at the
end of 1989. By the end of last year the figure had risen to nearly 19,100.
But an end to the boom in branch openings is still not in sight. This year
the milestone of 20,000 branches has been passed, and a further 1,400 new
branches were authorised in the first nine months.
'Many small towns are still without bank branches, and most of the new
branches we opened last year were in virgin territory,' says Mr Cesare
Geronzi, Banca di Roma's general manager. The Rome bank, created by the
Cassa di Risparmio di Roma's takeovers of Banco di Santo Spirito and Banco
di Roma, has the most aggressive expansion strategy of the main Italian
banks.
The merger of the three banks, completed in August, has not resulted in
branch closures. Quite the contrary. 'The networks of the indiv- idual banks
were not suff- iciently differentiated geog- raphically. We have beefed up
our presence where we were weak before. At the end of last year we had 850
branches. Now there are 1,060. By the end of 1993 there will be 1,380,' says
Mr Geronzi.
The bank has used its own internal resources, both financial and human, to
ach- ieve network growth. 'Ration- alising back office and head office
activities has freed personnel to staff new branches. Most of the openings
are leanly-manned sportelli leggeri, (small branches) with high automation
and a handful of employees,' explains Mr Geronzi.
Banca di Roma's general manager is particularly pleased about the commercial
agreement announced this spring with INA, the state- owned insurer. Nearly
180 of the new branches will be located in INA general agencies. 'The
arrangement is advantageous for both partners. Our large branch network is
ideal for dis- tributing insurance products, while the bank's presence
within INA's organisation strengthens its financial activity.'
Mr Geronzi sees the expan- sion of the large banks like his own as necessary
and inevit- able for the creation of truly national banks able to offer a
full range of services to a broad customer base through- out the country. He
expresses serious reservations, however, about the expansion of small banks.
Many small and medium- sized banks, he believes, have opened in Rome and
Milan for image only. 'Opening sporadic branches does not create networks.
The competition they offer has no rational basis, and will certainly not
help their profit and loss accounts. The newcomers are engaged in a price
war to obtain marginal, high-risk business.'
The central bank probably has similar thoughts. The analysis it published
earlier this year showed that small and medium-sized banks appear to have
satisfied their expansionary aims, or that the authorities consider their
expansion sufficient. Having won approval for 1,533 new branches in 1990,
they received the go-ahead for only 723 last year.
Though like Banca di Roma, it is a front-runner in its branch expansion,
Turin's Sanpaolo has been one of the least aggressive of Italy's large
banks. In the first half of the year Sanpaolo and its Lombardy subsidiaries
Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale Lombarda recorded net openings of only
27 new branches. Even so the group, with just over 800 branches at the end
of June, operates one of the biggest networks in Italy. Sanpaolo alone will
have almost 500 at the end of the year.
The bank has chosen a sharply focused expansion programme, rather than
saturation. 'Above all, Sanpaolo has been concerned with consolidating its
presence in its home areas of Piedmont, the Valle d'Aosta and Liguria, and
in the large conurbations of Turin, Milan, Genoa, Rome and Naples. New
branches aim to fill gaps in the market and in the operations of existing
branches,' says Mr Gianni Zandano, Sanpaolo's chairman.
Mr Zandano explains that branch expansion is a crucial element to achieve
the aim of boosting retail activity and strengthening deposit-taking among
small and medium-sized customers. Like other banks, in the increasingly
competitive Italian banking environment, Sanpaolo's new branches are
predominantly sportelli leggeri.
Formerly a public law credit institution, Sanpaolo started 1992 in its new
form of joint stock corporation and soon made news with the first
large-scale partial banking privatisation. Its public offer of 20 per cent
of ordinary stock in March was heavily over- subscribed.
When its transformation was undertaken at the end of last year, the Sanpaolo
had taken its stake in Crediop, the Rome-based medium and long-term
institution formerly controlled by the Treasury, to 89 per cent. This
represents a major investment. Sanpaolo aims to exploit its own branch
network to boost Crediop's business with small and medium-sized companies.
Crediop will feature in an important rationalisation exer- cise in the first
half of 1993, when its Credipar investment banking arm will be merged with
Sanpaolo Finance. 'The two companies are well matched,' says Mr Zandano. He
adds that own resources of L500bn and new wide-ranging articles of
association will give the operation a sharp competitive edge.
Sanpaolo's strategy appears to be paying off. 'In conditions that are
certainly not easy, the Sanpaolo closed the first half of the year with
excellent results that have been con- firmed by figures at the end of
September,' notes Mr Zandano. Contribution margin and gross operating margin
were respect- ively 21 and 39 per cent higher than at the same stage last
year.
Sanpaolo could be among a minority when banks close their books at year-end.
Many bankers expect poor figures and an out-turn worse than 1991. Aggregate
statistics from the central bank show that the banking system's net profits
slipped by 3.8 per cent last year. Though there was a slight improvement in
gross operating profit, which rose by 1.1 per cent, given 6.4 per cent
inflation, this was a decline in real terms.
With economic difficulties becoming evident, provisions for bad loans are
likely to increase. Already last year the adjusted ratio of default to
lending worsened, from 5.5 to 5.9 per cent. 'Even in Italy the deterioration
of assets has now become a concrete reality,' observes Mr Zandano, pointing
to the downturn in the econ- omic cycle and the delayed effects of the
1989-90 lending boom as the reasons.
However, while circum- stances are making them give even closer attention to
the accounts, it is unlikely that Italian bankers will let opportunities
slip. With privatisation offering scope for interesting operations, bankers
will be keeping their eyes skinned and ears open.
After two major takeovers there is speculation that Banca di Roma may still
want to grow by acquisition. Mr Geronzi scotches such rumours, emphasising
that Banca di Roma will have reached its definitive banking structure by the
end of next year and has no large banking operations in mind. And its
controlling shareholder, the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma, is not a candidate
for the 35 per cent stake that the IRI state holding corporation will sell.
'But we would be very happy if a foreign shareholder acquired this stake,'
remarks Mr Geronzi.
Will Banca di Roma be a detached observer when the Treasury sells INA? Mr
Geronzi says that the bank's agreement with the state- owned insurance
company is strictly commercial, cont- ractually watertight and not at risk.
But it is hard to envisage the bank standing quietly on the sidelines when
INA is privatised. Operations like this promise to add colour to Italian
banking in coming months, contrasting with the dull tones of banks'
accounts.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (2): No
hurry to re-enter the ERM - Why the lira has been kept in free float since
September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN AND Italy are both in the same boat with their currencies floating
outside the European Community's exchange rate mechanisms. Yet in public
their respective positions on re-entry are diametrically opposite.
The British, consistently reluctant to surrender the ultimate initiative on
monetary policy, insisted at the outset that they were in no hurry to return
to the ERM. In contrast, the Amato government immediately said it would seek
re-entry as soon as possible.
The Italian view was not surprising. Being inside the ERM has always been
seen, at least by the Bank of Italy, both as a necessary discipline and an
essential element in the battle against inflation. The politicians for their
part never seriously worried about surrendering sovereignty to Brussels
because Italy had always been a committed European and federalist in
outlook.
With the financial markets remaining unsettled, the positions of the two
countries in practice have become much closer. It suits neither to re-enter
the ERM in a hurry - at least in its present form. Both the Bank of Italy
and the Italian treasury have said as much in recent weeks.
Indeed, it has been advantageous for the Italian authorities to keep the
lira in free float since September, benefiting from what one newspaper
called the 'serenity of the excluded'. The Bank of Italy has not had to
intervene to support the lira which has been allowed to seek its own level
without a formal fixing and, as in Britain, interest rates have begun to
come down.
It is now known that the defence of the lira cost the Bank of Italy
L30,000bn in reserves and that support from the Bundesbank and Belgian
central bank was to the tune of L27,330bn - the bulk coming from the
Germans. At the end of September net reserves had fallen to their lowest
since 1978, standing at L32,917bn against L108,581bn 12 months before. By
the end of October they had climbed back to L44,157bn.
For almost three weeks after the lira was devalued by 7 per cent against the
D-mark, the currency appeared to be in free fall. At one stage the lira was
being quoted close to 1,000 against the D-mark. However, the Bank of Italy
proved right in its judgment that was an offshoot which would be corrected
and by late October the parity had fallen back. In recent weeks it has been
oscillating between L850-880 - equivalent to a 15 per cent devaluation
against the D-mark.
The Italian authorities remain bitter about the way that the lira was forced
to devalue alone on the weekend of September 12-13, convinced that a major
opportunity was lost for a more general realignment of the ERM (and a
consequently more responsive drop in German interest rates). The Bank of
Italy in particular had linked the credibility of its policies to defence of
the lira within the ERM. Although obliged by circumstances to reverse this
position, the Italians have good justification to say they were given
insufficient support from its EC partners and the subsequent turmoil was the
price paid by everyone.
At the time of being forced out of the ERM, the government insisted this
would be a temporary status and that Italy would return as soon as possible.
Their commitment to the ERM was undoubtedly genuine, but the authorities
also emphasised it for the very practical reason that they needed to sustain
international credibility amid fears that fiscal policy might be relaxed and
inflation return as a result of devaluation. The same thinking lay behind
the subsequent request for an Ecu8bn stand-by facility from the EC.
No timetable was formulated in public; but unofficially, the government
believed it would be able to seek re-entry once the 1993 budget had been
approved, the EC loan had been negotiated and the currency markets had
settled to give a stable judgment of the lira's parity. Initially, this
pointed to somewhere between mid-December and early January.
The 1993 budget, raising an extra L93,000bn in fresh taxes and revenues,
will have gone through parliament by the time this survey appears. Although
the 1993 public sector deficit will only be held down to this year's levels,
equivalent to over 10.5 per cent of GDP, for the first time structural
changes have been introduced to curb spending. These will affect four key
areas which have traditionally drained the treasury - public health,
pensions, the civil service and local administration. The reforms will also
have a cumulative effect in ensuing years.
Clear evidence of tackling the budget deficit has been, and will continue to
be, a pre-condition for Italy's credibility in the markets. Indeed, one of
the main factors behind the weakness of the lira was the markets' view that
not enough was being done to tackle Italy's deteriorating public finances.
The Bank of Italy has been able to cut the discount rate twice since the
high defence rate of 15 per cent introduced in September. At 13 per cent,
rates are still high and must come down further. Nevertheless, each
percentage point reduction reduces by nearly L15,000bn the annual cost of
debt service - a cost which next year will account for the entire public
sector deficit.
But the other conditions for re-entry have yet to be satisfied. Negotiations
on the EC loan have been slow and the currency markets have far from
settled. Added to this, the very nature and stability of the ERM have come
into question, and the lira's re-entry is an integral part of this issue.
Italy, after all, has been able to devalue by a far greater percentage than
would have been permitted by its partners back in September as part of a
broad EC currency realignment.
France, for instance, is concerned that with Italy accounting for almost 14
per cent of its total imports, the lira enjoys too great a competitive edge
on its current devaluation. On the other hand, the lira cannot re-enter at a
parity which the markets would deem as too high. This would merely prompt
speculation - and perhaps force the Italian currency once again out of the
ERM, and so further damage the credibility of the system as a whole.
This suggests that without a change in the ERM rules, Italy may find it more
convenient to keep the lira floating while stating it wishes to join the
system 'as soon as possible'.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (1): New
word in the language - Privatisation has quickly gained a place in the
financial lexicon with state-owned banks among the first destined for
disposal. Will big foreign banks be allowed to bid? Not even the timing has
been set yet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SUDDENLY, an unfamiliar, and until recently, slightly suspect, word has
entered Italian banking vocabulary. Privatisation, a pillar of the new Amato
government's strategy to tackle the huge budget deficit, has quickly gained
a place in the financial lexicon.
State-owned banks are among the first assets for disposal. Selling the three
banking stakes controlled by IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company,
will go a substantial way to plugging the gaping hole in the overborrowed
group's accounts, which now show consolidated debts of over L60,000bn.
Disposals of other companies such as Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the big
Rome-based financial services and insurance group, or subsidiaries of
capital-hungry Banca Nazionale del Lavoro could change the banking scene
even further.
Privatisation could also usher in a new era in Italian banking by freeing
banks from decades of political interference. That would liberate management
to make key decisions on expansion or takeovers on the basis of market
forces, rather than traditional political horse trading and the need to
share patronage among the main parties. Already, liberalised rules on
branching mean that consumers have gained far greater choice in their
banking relationships by subjecting the banks to increasing competition.
The past year has already seen limited steps in the direction of the market,
with the flotation of minority stakes in two public sector banks. Banco di
Napoli, the first, quoted around 20 per cent of its ordinary shares in
November 1991. Last January, the process took a hefty step forward with the
L1,250bn initial public offering of 20 per cent of the shares in Istituto
Bancario San Paolo di Torino, now Italy's biggest bank in terms of assets.
The prospect of selling Credito Italiano, the first of the IRI banks due to
be privatised, Banca Commerciale Italiana and IRI's remaining 35 per cent
stake in Banca di Roma has already created a new wave of uncertainty in
banking circles.
So far, there are far more questions than answers. Who will buy the shares?
Will the government opt for broad public flotations, possibly buttressed by
a 'hard core' of domestic institutional investors, or look to single buyers?
If the latter, will the Bank of Italy tolerate purchases by big foreign
banks keen to expand in Italy, which are the most obvious, but least
acceptable, bidders? Or will the central bank pull out all the stops to
encourage further concentration of the domestic banking system before
letting outsiders pick up some of Italy's financial flagships?
Not even the simplest question, timing, has been answered yet, although many
bankers expect IRI to sell its 67 per cent of Credito Italiano in the early
months of 1993.
Privatisations, due to raise L27,000bn for the government over the next
three years, also imply other changes. None more so than in stimulating the
stock market. In spite of a series of new laws reforming share trading,
banning insider dealing and setting out new rules on takeover bids, the
Milan bourse has remained a sorry place this year.
Turnover, although stimulated in the past two months by speculation over
possible privatisation stocks, remains relatively low, if above the
depressed levels of July and August. Not even a concession by the government
 -to suspend the highly unpopular capital gains tax until next September for
most private investors - has been enough to revive sentiment.
If the creation of a broad share-owning public is the government's aim, then
stronger action will be necessary to boost equity trading. Attempts to
introduce tax breaks for long-term private investors have so far proved
confused, while legislation to create pension funds, which would pump new
institutional money into the market, is moving forward, but not fast enough.
However, ministers still baulk at the biggest single reform to redress the
imbalance between government bonds, which retain strong tax advantages for
investors, and shares. Removing some of the tax breaks on treasury bills -
the most popular form of short-term savings instrument - could greatly
bolster the equity market. But tampering with the flow of private savings
into funding the government deficit is a reform that few ministers would
risk taking.
Meanwhile, the prospect of privatisation has added to the already
considerable uncertainty surrounding many of Italy's leading banks by
throwing new, and unexpected, cards into the air.
The process of concentration to create fewer, bigger banks with nationwide
coverage and the fullest range of services has been edging ahead under two
champions. While San Paolo has consolidated its position in wholesale
banking through the takeover of Crediop, the treasury-owned medium to
long-term lending institution, the new Banca di Roma has already become
Italy's biggest bank in terms of branches.
Formed from the three-way merger of the Rome savings bank - very much in the
driver's seat - Banco di Santo Spirito and Banco di Roma, the new group is
expanding aggressively. Yet even its horizons are clouded by the question of
who will buy IRI's 35 per cent stake.
Similar uncertainty surrounds many other big public sector banks,
irrespective of whether they are on the privatisation list or not. Plans to
sell IMI to Italy's savings banks, led by Cariplo of Milan, may reach
fruition by the end of 1992 after almost two years of volatile talks. Yet
even in the closing weeks before the government's year-end deadline for the
deal, which is a major element in this year's scheduled income from asset
sales, new doubts have complicated the transaction.
Almost as much uncertainty troubles BNL, the big treasury-owned bank whose
reputation is still reeling from the disclosure three years ago of huge,
unauthorised loans to Iraq from its Atlanta branch. Although BNL's need for
a recapitalisation has grown no less urgent with the passage of time, the
source of its essential new funds remains as fuzzy as ever.
The problems at BNL, which has gone some way to improving earnings and
removing the stigma of Atlanta under its new management, has been
exacerbated by the well-publicised decision by Ina, the state-owned
insurance group which is another prime privatisation candidate, to divest
its 20 per cent stake in the bank. Disposing of the BNL shares is a virtual
precondition to floating Ina, which also has a substantial holding in IMI.
Rather than throwing in its lot with BNL, as was widely expected, Ina
decided earlier this year to seal a cross-marketing pact for banking and
insurance products with Banca di Roma. The alliance, one of a string of
recent agreements in 'bancassurance' which have already linked Generali and
RAS with BCI and San Paolo with the Fondiaria group, is likely to be
followed by other bank-insurance ties.
Such alliances highlight the degree to which many of the pieces in Italy's
new jigsaw of financial services are closely interlinked. And at some stage,
the authorities will also need to turn their attention to the south, where
Banco di Napoli, Banco di Sicilia and Banco di Sardegna all probably need to
find new partners.
Matters are no clearer in the private sector. Recent weeks have been
decisive for Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), now Italy's biggest
private sector bank, following the decision by two of the five institutions
controlling its shares to pull out. Meanwhile, Banca Nazionale
dell'Agricoltura, previously the country's largest private sector financial
institution, continues to be beset by poor profitability which has raised
growing doubts about the ability of its controlling shareholder to maintain
the bank's independence.
Against this background, Italy's banks face the problem of declining loan
quality as a result of the growing recession. The fall in corporate profits
and the rising payments difficulties of business customers mean that banks
will have to make much higher lending provisions when they report their 1992
results. Add to that the prospect of hefty write-downs on government bond
portfolios caused by the collapse in prices ahead of September's currency
turmoil and the likelihood of sharp losses on the value of banks' equity
holdings, and the overall picture emerges of Italian banking at the
crossroads, facing great opportunities one way and unprecedented
difficulties and uncertainty in the other.

A GROUP of US state pension funds and insurance companies have filed a
multi-million dollar lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street
securities house, and retail group May Department Stores, claiming the two
companies illegally attempted to buy back high-interest debt they issued in
the 1980s.
The suit, which asks for Dollars 24m in compensatory damages and Dollars
100m in punitive damages, claims that Morgan Stanley and May Department
Stores committed fraud and breach of contract earlier this year when the
retailer used money raised from Dollars 200m new low-interest bonds to pay
off Dollars 425m of high-yielding bonds it had issued in 1988.
The pension funds and insurers who bought the bonds - the Alabama,
California and Montana state pension programmes, and a bond fund and two
affiliated insurance companies controlled by Boston-based insurer John
Hancock - say they lost Dollars 24m in earnings they would have made between
1992 and 1998 because of the early call on the bonds.
Morgan Stanley would not comment on the lawsuit.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Number of loss-making US
national banks falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of loss-making commercial banks in the US is declining, according
to a report by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the US
regulatory agency.
The report said the number of unprofitable national banks was lower in the
first nine months of 1992 than it had been in many years. For the first nine
months of this year losses were reported by some 278 banks, or 8 per cent of
national banks. This compared with an average of 681 banks, or 16 per cent
of the total, which had suffered losses in the first three quarters of each
of the previous five years.
The OCC report said national banks disclosed aggregate profits of Dollars
4.66bn in the third quarter of 1992, nearly Dollars 3bn higher than the
aggregate total in the same quarter of last year. The improvement in bank
profits came in large part from rising net interest income and gains on the
sale of investment securities, both of which benefited from low interest
rates.
Over the past two years big banks had increased their holdings of investment
securities, including Treasury securities, by Dollars 80bn, or 25 per cent,
the OCC said.

BOEING, the US aerospace group, said it would implement the new Financial

The company said the change would be reflected in restated first-quarter
results. In its 1991 annual report Boeing estimated an after-tax earnings
impact of between Dollars 900m and Dollars 1.2bn. For 1992, this will
represent a decrease in earnings per share of about 6 cents each quarter, it
added.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Fresh disarray in US-Mexico narcotics case: Doctor kidnapped
to face trial over murdered agent is cleared by judge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LOS ANGELES, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MEXICAN doctor kidnapped and taken across the border to the US to stand
trial over a drug agent's murder was found innocent by a judge in Los
Angeles yesterday, AP reports from Los Angeles.
The decision came as a stunning blow to the prosecution in the case, which
has caused political controversy in both Mexico and the US.
The judge ruled that the US government never had sufficient evidence to try
Dr Humberto Alavarez Machain in connection with the death in 1985 of the US
drugs agent Enrique Camarena.
'There has to be stronger evidence than you have offered to find that a man
is guilty of kidnapping, murder and torture,' District Judge Edward Rafeedie
told the prosecutors. 'This does not rise to the level required to get this
case to the jury.'
He accused federal prosecutors of presenting 'the wildest speculation'.
The prosecutors had argued that when Mr Camarena was kidnapped and tortured
to death by Mexico's drug lords, they had Dr Alvarez Machain inject him with
drugs to keep him alive for further torture.
The doctor was kidnapped by bounty hunters in Guadalajara in April 1990 and
was then spirited to the US for trial.
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) maintains that his kidnapping
was legal and justified.
But the Mexican government protested that the doctor's kidnapping violated
Mexican sovereignty and it has repeatedly demanded his return.
In the latest trial - the third resulting from the drug agent's killing -
the defence attorney said there were no puncture marks or drug residue in
the agent's body to prove he had been given injections. Nor were there
fingerprints to link a syringe found at the torture house to Dr Alvarez
Machain, he said.
Seven people have been convicted in US courts in the Camarena killing and
more than two dozen in Mexico.
Judge Rafeedie had already refused to grant a judgment of acquittal for Dr
Alvarez Machain's co-defendant, Ruben Zuno Arce, a brother-in-law of former
Mexican President Luis Echeverria.
He also ruled earlier that the doctor's kidnapping violated US-Mexico
extradition treaties and that US courts did not have jurisdiction to try
him. But on that ruling, the judge eventually was overturned by the US
Supreme Court.
Damian Fraser adds from Mexico City: Allegations highlighted lately in the
case of the murdered drugs agent have come at an inconvenient time for the
Mexican government, which is anxious to build ties to the incoming Clinton
administration in the US.
According to two witnesses called by the US government, high Mexican
officials were all in the pay of the Guadalajara drug cartel.
The witnesses claimed that these officials were present at meetings in which
Mr Camarena's murder was planned and visited the house where Mr Camarena was
held on the day he was killed.
In the view of the Mexican government the charges are 'based on the
testimony of delinquents and criminals who do not merit credibility in light
of their personal history'.
The accusations, whether true or not, are likely to draw attention to the
greatest flaw in the Mexican state: corruption in the legal and political
system.
In practically all the big drug scandals over the past decade, be it the
murder of Mr Camarena, the prison riot between rival drug gangs at Matamoros
last year, or the shoot-out between the army and police in Veracruz this
year, officials of the police, the army or the government have been
implicated in narcotics trafficking.
The police are also largely responsible for Mexico's dismal human rights
record, another issue likely to be raised by the US Congress when it
considers the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).

FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: US nearer to full trade ties with Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday moved the US a step further towards normal
relations with Vietnam by authorising US companies to open offices, conduct
feasibility studies and sign contracts in the country.
Mr Bush refused, however, to lift outright the US embargo on trade with
Vietnam - contracts that are signed may only be executed after the embargo
is lifted.
The US has over the last two years progressed slowly in accord with a
'road-map' towards normalisation of its relationship with Vietnam. It has
made its concessions conditional on co-operation on its investigations into
the fate of US servicemen listed as missing in action (MIA) during the
Vietnam war as well as on efforts to restore peace to Cambodia, where
Vietnam has backed the Phnom Penh government led by Mr Hun Sen.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said yesterday that the
latest step had been taken because of the Vietnamese government's
co-operation on the MIA investigations.
Vietnam has recently made new evidence, including a large collection of
photographs, available to US investigators. Senator John Kerry, the Vietnam
war veteran who chairs a Senate committee looking into the fate of the MIAs,
recently told Mr Bush that the Vietnamese had been 'forthcoming'.
The third phase, involving limited diplomatic links and a complete end to
the trade embargo, is to take effect six months after a Cambodian peace plan
has been in effect with full Vietnamese co-operation.
The final phase, with full diplomatic relations, most favoured nation
trading status and an end to restrictions on lending to Vietnam by the World
Bank and other multilateral development banks, is not expected to be
implemented until Vietnam has an elected government.
US companies fear being left out of the race to take part in Vietnam's
economic development. Japan last month resumed development aid to the
country, and businesses from other Asian countries, Australia and France,
are already investing there.

FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Shake-out forecast in pulp and paper
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S paper and pulp industry faces accelerating rationalisation,
according to Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive of Stora, the region's largest
paper group.
Mr Berggren, speaking at the FT world pulp and paper conference in London,
pointed out the industry remained far too fragmented. Many plants,
particularly in France, Italy and Spain, were outdated and small. In these
countries there were uncoated woodfree paper machines still running which
dated from before the war.
Mr Dick Eykel, board member at KNP, the Dutch group, blamed overcapacity for
the industry's woes. Prices were at the lowest real levels for the last few
decades.
'It's a shame when some markets are growing at 9.5 per cent that an industry
is capable of ruining itself through overcapacity. It's a question of bad
management,' said Mr Eykel. He called for companies to time investments
better.
The industry's restructuring should ultimately lead to a more stable
environment and growth patterns which were less cyclical, said Mr Alain
Soulas, chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British group.
The consolidation should help reduce the degree of over-investment by
combining expansion plans. The far more consolidated US industry had
achieved an average return over the last 15 years of 12 per cent compared
with the European industry's 8 per cent.

<TEXT>
Spain's inflation rate has fallen to 5.1 per cent after the government
reported much better-than-expected price rises of just 0.1 per cent in
November, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid.
If inflation continues downward the government could begin to cut interest
rates as early as next spring. With unemployment rising and growth still
falling, the interest rate cut will be important to the timing of the
general election Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez must hold by next October.
The November price figures show that the devaluation of the peseta in
September has had little inflationary impact and the second devaluation, in
November, is unlikely to affect December inflation much, economists say.

Britain will face pressure from its EC partners today to approve funding for
a Brussels-backed strategy to market high definitition television to the
European public, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels.
EC telecommunications ministers will reconsider a European Commission plan
to pump Ecu850m (Dollars 1bn) into the promotion of HDTV over five years.
France and the Netherlands strongly support the spending, mainly because
Thomson and Philips, their national electronics giants, have invested
millions in developing the D2-Mac and HD-Mac Technology.
Britain's opposition to the HDTV strategy caused an uproar at an EC telecoms
council last month. Last night, UK officials continued to express
reservations: 'We don't think the idea is attractive, and we don't think it
is coherent.'
Under revised plans, the Commission wants to channel money to consortia for
satellite broadcasting, as well as conversion and production of programmes
using HDTV technology.
Money may also go to other widescreen TV services such as Pal Plus.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Post-summit firm tone gives way to ERM
tensions

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUCCESSFUL conclusion of the European Community summit in Edinburgh at
the weekend encouraged some European government bond markets to start on a
firm note yesterday. However, prices drifted lower on thin volumes
throughout the day as dealers doubted whether tensions within the European
exchange rate mechanism have been laid to rest.
Even though the Danish government was pleased with the exemptions for some
of the provisions in the Maastricht treaty agreed at the weekend, dealers
warn that it is unclear how the amendments will be treated in the
forthcoming Danish referendum.
GERMAN government bond prices closed lower with the Liffe bund future
contract falling from a high of 91.63 to end at around 91.51. Dealers noted
some selling out of the Far East.
According to a Reuters report, the Bonn finance ministry is considering the
issue of a regular federal government bond at the end of the year.
THE DUTCH government sold Fl 800m of its new 30-year tap stock at par
yesterday, the first day of trading in the new issue.
The Dutch government bond market drifted lower in thin trading, but dealers
noted interest from domestic buyers in the new issue, the 7 1/2 per cent
bond due 2023. The 30-year stock, which is the first such Dutch bond to be
launched since 1964, was quoted at below par during the trading session. The
tap sales are expected to continue throughout the week, dealers said.
The money raised from the tap issue will be used to meet the state's
financing requirement for 1993. The state said it aimed to raise a total of
Fl 10bn with the 7 1/2 per cent bond, which will be sold in six tranches.
The state has forecast a total financing requirement of Fl 47.2 bn in 1993,
against Fl 47.9bn in 1992.
FRENCH government bonds closed lower, with dealers pointing to
disappointment over the weekend EC summit in Edinburgh. The December futures
contract quoted on the Matif exchange fell from 110.46 to 110.08.
SPANISH government bonds gained on the release of favourable economic data
yesterday showing a 0.1 per cent rise in November inflation.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the economy minister, was quoted yesterday saying he did
not expect an economic recovery before 1994 and revised downwards inflation
projections for this year and next. He said Spain had entered a period of
disinflation and inflation was expected to be a little below 5.5 per cent
this year and less than 4.5 per cent in 1993.
The 10-year 11.30 per cent bond yielded 12.63 per cent, against 12.75 per
cent at Friday's close.
UK government bonds edged higher in thin trade, but dealers said the Bank of
England's latest tap issues - which amount to Pounds 700m - are likely to
keep a cap on price movements over the next few days. Traders pointed out
that calls on two existing stocks may also put a dampener on the gilts
market.
The tap stocks include Pounds 100m of the 8 per cent Treasury stock due
2002/2006, Pounds 250m of the 9 per cent Treasury due 2008, and Pounds 350m
of the 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012.
The Liffe gilt future inched up from 99.27 to 99.29 by late afternoon in
thin volume, while in the cash market the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose
from 108 31/32 to 109 1/32 .
JAPANESE government bond prices fell back as hopes of a cut in the official
discount rate receded yesterday.
Although the Tankan report, the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business
confidence released on Friday, painted a gloomy picture of the Japanese
economy, dealers said the bad news had already been priced into the market
and was largely as expected.
Bonds in the four to seven-year area led the fall in prices across the
curve, with the benchmark No 145 JGB moving from a yield of 4.605 per cent
to end at 4.65 per cent. The March futures contract opened at 107.71 and
dropped to 107.44, closing at the low of the day.
US Treasuries eased slightly across the maturity ranges yesterday in subdued
trading.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 102,
yielding 7.451 per cent. Prices at the short end of the market were also
slightly weaker, with the two-year note down  3/32 at 99 21/32 to carry a
yield of 4.793 per cent.
Traders reported that activity was extremely light during the morning
session, although the lack of business was not blamed on the recent storm
which caused havoc in New York's business district last Friday and over the
weekend.
Instead, it was the absence of fresh economic statistics yesterday, and a
reluctance among investors and dealers to trade before the housing starts,
industrial production and jobless claims data due out later in the week,
that was behind the lacklustre showing.

Eurobond altered

<TEXT>
BONDHOLDERS have voted in favour of changing the documentation of a Dollars
200m Eurobond issued last year by Statni Banka, the Czechoslovakian central
bank. Without the change, the bonds would have gone into default when
Czechoslovakia splits into Slovak and Czech republics on January 1.
As part of the break up, the state bank will be dissolved and its role will
be taken over by new central banks for each of the republics, according to
Nomura International, which arranged the original issue.
The bondholders agreed that the issue should be the joint responsibility of
the Slovak and Czech republics and changed an event of default clause which
provided for early redemption of the bonds in the event of Czechoslovakia
breaking up, according to lead manger Nomura International.
Of the original Dollars 200m issue size, Dollars 188.9m was outstanding
before the vote, the balance having been repurchased by the borrower. The
vote in favour of the changes accounted for Dollars 160.8m, with no votes
against. The deal, which matures in November 1994, is now trading at a
margin of 400 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield, 100 basis
points higher than at launch a year ago. A Y10bn placement for Statni Banka
in the Japanese market is undergoing a similar process.

A CONTROVERSIAL Euroyen bond offering for the Republic of Austria yesterday
failed to attract investor interest. The Y75bn offering of eight-year bonds

The par bonds carry a coupon of 5 per cent, which was as much as  1/4 point
lower than the pricings put forward to the borrower by other banks.
However, IBJ said that it had taken a view that the yen bond market will
look attractive in the early part of next year, and the issue was a way of
taking a position in the market accordingly. IBJ International arranged a
Y25bn five-year offering for the European Investment Bank on Friday, which
was also viewed as aggressively priced.
Dealers said there is now a broadly held view that a Japanese prime rate cut
will not come before the end of the year. However, the payment date for the
Austria deal is not until the second half of January, which provides IBJ
with something of a breathing space.
While it is not uncommon for banks to express a contrary market view by
taking bonds on their books, it is unusual to launch a new issue for this
purpose, especially one which is syndicated among a group of banks. In the
case of the Republic of Austria deal, IBJ assembled an underwriting group
consisting of 22 banks and securities houses. However, these underwriters
performed no practical function, merely selling the bonds allocated to them
back to IBJ at break-even. The only apparent reason for these banks to
participate was to have their names quoted as participants in a deal for a
prestigious sovereign borrower.
At the end of the day, the bonds were bid at 99.70, a 30 basis point
discount which is equal to full fees.
However, IBJ denied accusations from other houses that the deal had been
engineered to push IBJ a few notches up the league table of Eurobond lead
managers compiled at the end of the year, which many banks use as a
marketing tool.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Move to common formats in the
securities industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE's securities industry is poised to take a further step towards
automation and greater efficiency.
A steering group of institutional investors and banks, due to meet first on
January 15, has been formed to promote common formats for the delivery of
securities information between the groups.
This relatively unfashionable sector of the securities industry still relies
heavily on paper-based confirmation systems.
The standard message formats will be based upon work done in the US by the
Industry Standardisation for Institutional Trade Communications (ISITC)
committee, and will consider the needs of European-based cross-border fund
managers and custodians.
A preliminary meeting in London last week attracted representatives from
more than 40 institutions - mostly UK fund managers and banks - and the
major US-based global custodians. One result was to clear up initial
misunderstandings about the possible duplication of efforts with Europe's
Electronic Trade Confirmation (ETC) project, said Mr Sean Quinn of Chase
Manhattan Bank. ETC is designed to link investors and brokers and help them
confirm trades automatically.
'Fund managers actively involved in ETC user group advisory boards were
represented at the meeting, underlying the complementary nature of the two
initiatives,' said Mr Quinn. 'This is a good example of competitors putting
their competitive positions aside to move the industry forward.'
A representative of SWIFT, which earlier agreed to allow fund managers to
join it, will advise the steering committee.
Agreeing standard formats should reduce errors and failed trades, and
contain costs, said Mr Otello Sturino of State Street Bank, adding that the
ambitions and timetable which are emerging for ISITC are aggressive.
'If we can ratify message types in the first quarter of 1993 we can
establish pilot groups of managers and custodians to exchange information in
the ISITC format. If this is successful in Europe in 1993, the Pacific Rim
will be the last missing piece.'

THE TURKISH Treasury plans to shift part of its borrowing from the short
term to one-year borrowing in 1994 in order to balance its cash-flow
movements more effectively, Reuter reports from Istanbul.
'1993 will be a transition year. We will issue a set amount of one-year
bonds in January and we will auction these in diminishing maturities
throughout the year,' said a senior Treasury official.
The Treasury now issues one-year bonds occasionally during the year. It
auctions one-year, nine-month, six-month and three-month issues in turn
every week but it does not set in advance the amount it borrows in each
auction.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: DSM in short production cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, yesterday reconfirmed the dire state of the
European petrochemical industry when the company announced it was cutting
production temporarily between Christmas and January 1 next year.
Petrochemical manufacturers normally try to keep their capital-intensive
plants running at full capacity to cover their fixed costs.
The company said it would cut high density polyethylene and polypropylene
production because of poor prices and high stock levels. DSM refused to
detail the scale of the cutbacks.
DSM's move follows a decision in September to cut ethylene production on one
of the trains on its second cracker. DSM has annual capacity to manufacture
just over 1m tonnes of ethylene and 220,000 tonnes of high-density
polyethylene.
Mr Arthur Spiertz, public affairs manager, said: 'DSM is dissatisfied with
current market prices and associated profitability levels, so the lower
output also serves to support the company's price policy.'
The move highlights the plight of the sector, which is suffering from
massive overcapacity. Five European manufacturers are expected to introduce
an additional 2m tonnes of ethylene capacity between 1991 and 1994.
European operating rates are presently about 85 per cent.

<TEXT>
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, yesterday released a report valuing
its stock at up to ADollars 2.50 a share more than the ADollars 8.80 offered
by Campbell Soup, the US food group. Grant Samuel, the merchant bank which
prepared the report, said the bid 'substantially undervalues Arnotts and is
not fair and reasonable'. It said the shares were worth ADollars 10.78 to
ADollars 11.32.
Arnotts' shares rose nine cents to ADollars 9.20 on the Australian Stock
Exchange after the report was released, recovering ground lost after the
government allowed the bid to proceed last week.
Campbell said the valuation was unrealistic. 'No sound financial analysis
can support such a high value for Arnotts. The range is completely out of
line with market expectations and analyst valuations.'
The report provides support for the Arnotts board, which has called for a
'significant' improvement on the Campbell offer. Schroders, the merchant
bank which is advising Arnotts, earlier suggested ADollars 12 would be a
fair price.
Campbell, which owns just under 33 per cent of Arnotts, is seeking a further
17.2 per cent for a majority stake of 50.1 per cent, but has offered to
acquire up to 100 per cent of the stock. The offer values Arnotts at
ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 857m).

US group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics company, and National Semiconductor, of
the US, yesterday announced an alliance aimed at developing a market for
Toshiba's proprietary technology for flash memory devices, semiconductors
which retain information when the power is switched off, much like hard disk
drives.
Flash memory is one of the hottest products in the electronics industry and
is expected eventually to replace disk drives and other magnetic recording
devices in a wide range of portable electronic equipment.
Sales have been dominated by a technology developed by Intel of the US,
which dominates the world's microprocessor market.
Although Toshiba is credited with inventing flash memory, its design of
flash memory has proved more difficult to develop into useable products.
The company earlier this year formed an alliance with IBM, in which Toshiba
would share its flash memory technology, while IBM would share technology
for a controller device allowing high-speed read and write functions.
Toshiba and National Semiconductor said yesterday the Toshiba technology was
most suitable to replace hard and floppy disk drives in computers and
workstations.
Under the terms of the deal, Toshiba will licence its technology to National
Semiconductor and will have rights to derivative technology developed by
National Semiconductor.
Toshiba said a principal motivation for the deal was to encourage
development of the market for its technology by developing a second source
of supply for would-be users.
The agreement follows a common pattern of deals between US and Japanese
semiconductor makers, who have sought shelter from the risks of the
semiconductor business by working together.

profits decline
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA Motor, Japan's leading car maker, yesterday warned of another sharp
decline in profits in the year ending June as a result of sluggish sales in
the Japanese market.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president, said Toyota's parent-company pre-tax profits
were expected to slide by about 20 per cent to Y300bn (Dollars 2.4bn) in the
year to the end of June, the third consecutive year of declining profits.
With Toyota, Japan's most efficient and profitable car company, revising
profits projections downward, a shadow has been cast over the rest of
Japan's car makers, who may also be forced to lower their profits forecasts
again.
Already, Nissan is expecting a Y20bn net loss for the year to the end of
March, while Mazda has been struggling to stay in the black.
Mr Toyoda said the decline reflected both weak total sales volumes and poor
sales of more profitable luxury models. Profits since the end of the last
fiscal year have been runnng roughly 30 per cent below a year ago.
In August, Toyota had projected a sales increase of 5 per cent and level
profits. Toyota said yesterday that the value of sales would increase only
marginally to Y9,000bn.
The projected profits will be the lowest since the company merged its
manufacturing and sales operations in 1982, and compare with record pre-tax
profits of Y733.9bn in the year to June 1990.
But Toyota said it anticipated a modest recovery in vehicle sales in the
first half of calendar 1993. Overall, Toyota expects the volume of domestic
sales to decline by 5 per cent this year, and anticipates a 3 per cent
growth in sales next year.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Indonesia issues threat to
liquidate Bank Summa
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indonesian government said yesterday it would liquidate troubled Bank
Summa within two days unless the Soeryadjaya family, its owners, injected
new capital. Brokers saw the move as forcing the family to sell their
majority holding in Astra International, Indonesia's dominant automotive
company, to raise finance.
The suspension of Bank Summa in mid-November, with debts of more than
Rp1,000bn (Dollars 487m), has brought into question the health of
Indonesia's banking sector, caused customers to withdraw deposits from three
other banks and led to heavy selling pressure on the Jakarta stock market.
'If there is no fresh money being injected, the government will act to
liquidate Bank Summa in the next one or two days,' Mr Murdiono, state
secretary, said yesterday.
Diplomats say the statement is likely to have been instigated by President
Suharto.
Mr Murdiono added the government would not allow the Soeryadjayas to borrow
further from domestic banks and would oppose the Soeryadjayas' raising
offshore finance.
The Soeryadjayas have failed to meet an action plan, agreed in June, to
inject new money into Bank Summa, despite raising more than Rp700bn in loans
from domestic banks, secured against their Astra shareholding. A Rp500bn
loan from a three-bank consortium, headed by state-owned Exim Bank, matures
on Friday.
In the last week, the Soeryadjayas have held negotiations with two competing
consortia to sell more than 100m Astra shares, over 40 per cent of the
company. The consortia are headed by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a timber
businessman with political connections, and Mr Hashim Djojohadikusumo, son
of Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, appointed Astra chairman in September.
Bankers to Astra have expressed reservations over some of the potential new
shareholders. They say the company's cost of borrowing is certain to
increase. Astra has foreign loans of over Dollars 900m, of which, brokers
say, more than half are scheduled for renewal within the next 12 months.

SANYO Securities, the second-tier Japanese broker, is to close three
overseas offices. It will close subsidiaries in Paris and Melbourne and its
representative office in Frankfurt at the end of this month.
While all Japanese securities houses are under pressure to cut costs due to
low volumes on the Tokyo stock market, profits at second-tier houses, which
rely on retail bus-iness, have been hit severely.
The announcement comes as all Japan's second-tier brokers are losing money,
and when ties between smaller brokers and larger houses have been strained
by problems at leading brokers.
Sanyo said seven local employees in Paris, and two in Melbourne would lose
their jobs. The closures will scale down Sanyo's overseas network to five
subsidiaries and two representative offices.

job cuts

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the US carmaker which is in the middle of a restructuring,
has reached agreement with the United Auto Workers Union which will allow
the company to slash thousands of jobs.
The new early retirement plan will be financed by up to Dollars 450m in
joint UAW/GM joint training funds.
The package comes in two parts. The first will be available to all active
UAW workers aged 62 or older who retire in February or March next year. They
will receive full pension benefits including healthcare.
As an incentive, GM is also offering to contribute Dollars 13,000 towards
the purchase of a new GM car.
The second part lowers the age of retirement to 50 for workers who have been
at the company for at least 10 years.
GM is also eliminating its income limit so that retired employees will be
eligible for full GM pensions even if they find jobs elsewhere.
The UAW represents about 300,000 GM employees. The plan is believed to
target about 22,000 GM hourly workers who have already lost their jobs but
receive full salaries under GM's national contract with the UAW.
Mr Stephen Yokich, head of the union's GM department, said that about 7,000
workers had indicated that they would accept the portion of the plan open to
workers aged 50 to 61, although there is no way of knowing how many would
actually retire.
There are no estimates of how many workers would accept the portion open to
employees aged 62 or over.
'This agreement demonstrates that we can work together to address the
challenges faced by the union and the corporation,' said Mr Yokich.
'At the same time, it's clear that GM's problems cannot be solved a the
bargaining table alone. Health care reform, realistic trade policies and a
vigorous economic recovery are also essential,' he added.
An earlier salaried employee buy-out programme was extremely popular,
allowing GM to push forward its goal of cutting 20,000 salaried jobs by one
year, to the end of 1993.
The latest move comes at a time when GM is trying to restore the
profitability of its loss-making North American operations.
Earlier this month, GM unveiled plans to close nine more North American
plants and dispose of about 14 per cent of its automotive components
operations.

<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the US media and entertainment group, is hoping to reduce its
Dollars 9bn borrowings by a third over the next two or three years by either
selling assets or issuing asset-backed bonds.
Mr Geoffrey Holmes, the Time Warner vice-president who last week told a New
York seminar that the company wanted to 'monitise' about Dollars 3bn of
assets, said at the weekend that the aim was 'to improve our balance sheet'
by converting certain shareholdings into cash generating assets.
Mr Holmes specified a series of equity investments 'that are not presently
put through our profit and loss account' as being possible candidates for
disposal.
While stressing that no decisions had been taken, Mr Holmes said that these
investments included:
A 15 per cent stake - worth about Dollars 125m - in Black Entertainment
Television, a cable network.
An 11 per cent stake - worth around Dollars 150m - in QVC, the home-shopping
cable television network whose most recent investor is Mr Barry Diller, the
former chairman of the Fox film and television studio.
A 50 per cent stake - worth 'a few hundred million dollars' - in the Six
Flags theme park group.
A 21 per cent stake - worth about Dollars 1.2bn - in Turner Broadcasting,
the Atlanta-based group controlled by Mr Ted Turner.
A 37.5 per cent stake - with a book value in Time Warner's accounts of
Dollars 175m - in Whittle Communications.
Mr Holmes said that Time Warner may not sell all of these assets.
In some cases, the company may issue bonds which are backed by the assets,
as with its current offer of Dollars 500m of zero-coupon convertible bonds
backed by Time Warner's 14 per cent stake in Hasbro, the toymaker.

He added that Time Warner had 50 per cent of cable television ventures from
New York to Florida and Texas with a total of 1.5m subscribers and which
generate about Dollars 135m of annual cash flow. Although the value of these
cable subscriptions is about Dollars 1.5bn, less Dollars 400m of related
debt, Time Warner might decide to buy out some partners rather than sell its
holdings.
This would enable the company to place more cash flow in its profit and loss
account.
The Time Warner executive acknowledged that the company's earlier hopes of
lowering its debt level by raising Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn from European
and Asian partners had not gone as quickly as had been planned after the
1989 merger of Time and Warner Communications. However, he said more
international alliances would be unveiled over the next year.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dofasco battles its way back
into profit - Robert Gibbens assesses the steel maker's options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steel maker and an industry leader until to late
1980s, is battling its way back to profitability and a new niche in the
north American market.
The company is shutting a further 1m tonnes of uneconomic ingot capacity at
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada's steel capital, and considering a joint venture
thin-slab casting mill either in Canada or the US.
Dofasco, which specialises in flat rolled products for the car and appliance
markets, was one of the first north American steel makers to adopt
continuous casting and until the late 1980s was profitable.
High pay rates kept the United Steelworkers' union at bay, while attrition
and early retirements enabled it to introduce automation with the minimum of
pain.
In 1988 Dofasco bought Algoma Steel from Canadian Pacific for CDollars 560m
(USDollars 438.6m) to build up its raw steel capacity, and continued to
spend heavily on all its plants.
But by 1989, north America was sliding into recession. As the steel market
faltered, Dofasco was forced to retrench. High interest rates and a strong
Canadian dollar, followed by trade disputes with the US, made matters worse.
Dofasco had to write off its Algoma investment.
Last summer Dofasco closed a castings operation and announced early
retirement plans to take its payroll to 9,000, down 2,000 in two years.
Eventually the workforce would dip below 7,000, it warned.
In the first nine months of 1992, after restructuring charges, Dofasco lost
CDollars 98m, or CDollars 1.52 a share, on sales of CDollars 1.5bn, against
a loss of CDollars 23m, or 64 cents, on sales of CDollars 1.55bn a year
earlier. Shipments rose slightly to 2.5m tonnes.
Dofasco has taken several key decisions.
It will omit the dividend due January 1 1993 to conserve cash. This follows
omissions in the previous two quarters. The preferred dividends will be
maintained.
The No. 1 ingot line will shut next summer. This will lead to a special
pre-tax charge of CDollars 150m, to be taken in the final quarter of 1993,
and including severance costs for a further workforce reduction of 2,000.
A considerable offset will come from using a pension fund surplus.
Annual capacity will fall to 3m tonnes.
The company will decide next year whether to go ahead with a mini-mill
costing between CDollars 250m and CDollars 300m. 'It would give us
competitive high quality flat rolled steel to complement our existing
output,' says executive vice-president, Mr John Mayberry.
Much may depend on US recovery and the steel trade dispute with the US. The
recent US decision to slap heavy duties on steel imports from 12 countries,
alleging subsidised prices, could firm steel markets in north America. These
countries represent 3-5 per cent of the US hot and cold rolled and
galvanised markets.

MR PETER Munk, the Toronto entrepreneur, has settled his dispute over the
future of Clark Oil &amp; Refining, the US oil refiner and distributor, with his
long-standing associate, Mr Anthony Novello.
Horsham, controlled by Mr Munk, owns 60 per cent of Clark and has now
reached agreement to buy out the 40 per cent minority holding from Mr
Novello for USDollars 100m in cash.
Horsham said that it had wanted to buy the Clark minority shares since it
first bought control in 1988.
'Horsham will now own 100 per cent of Clark and have unrestricted ability to
manage it to maximise shareholder value,' said Mr Paul Melnuk, president of
Horsham.
Horsham owns 21 per cent of American Barrick Resources, the gold producer
which is also controlled by Mr Munk.
This summer Mr Novello, a St Louis oil dealer, succeeded in blocking
Horsham's plan to take Clark public.
Clark, which owns two US refineries and nearly 900 retail outlets in the
mid-western US, had 1991 revenues of USDollars 2.4bn and profit of USDollars
38m.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: DeCrane to be new Texaco head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXACO, the big US energy group, yesterday said that Mr Alfred DeCrane,
chairman for the past five years, would take over as chief executive next
April, following the retirement of Mr James Kinnear, who has been president
and chief executive since 1987.
The 61-year-old Mr DeCrane joined Texaco in 1959 and served in a number of
senior positions at the energy group before joining the board's executive
committee in 1978.
He became president in 1983 and chairman four years later.
Mr Kinnear, who will be 65 next March, joined Texaco in 1954 and was
appointed to the group's board in 1977.
In its third quarter of 1992 Texaco disclosed a 5.9 per cent decline in net
earnings.
The company attributed the fall to costs associated with property damage
caused by Hurricane Andrew and debt-related expenses.
The drop - from Dollars 286m to Dollars 269m - translated into earnings per
share of 94 cents, down from Dollars 1.01 a year ago. However, Texaco argued
that without special charges its third-quarter 1992 net would have been
Dollars 1.10 a share, or Dollars 309m.
Revenues in the quarter were 6.9 per cent higher at Dollars 10bn.
For the first nine months of 1992, Texaco's net income dropped by 26.4 per
cent to Dollars 714m on revenues that were 2 per cent lower at Dollars
27.97bn.

PETROFINA, Belgium's largest industrial company, said it cut 1992 capital
spending by 10-20 per cent against an initial budget of BFr52bn (Dollars
1.6bn), following an expected sharp fall in 1992 profit, Reuter reports.
However, Petrofina said it would not institute any reductions affecting
strategic projects of the company. The company said it had drawn up a
capital spending budget of about BFr40bn in 1993, but gave no precise
estimated final spending figure for 1992.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Ocean joins European white goods
alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FRENCH-inspired project to create a European alliance of domestic
appliances makers to compete against the growing concentration of power in
the white goods industry yesterday received its finishing touch.
Ocean, the last remaining independent Italian maker of home appliances, with
annual sales of FFr3.2bn (Dollars 603m) mainly in refrigerators, washing
machines and cooking equipment, became the fourth member of a group started
two years ago by French-state owned Thomson Electromenager and Fagor, the
leading Spanish white goods group.
The other member, which joined last June, is General Domestic Appliances,
the Anglo-American group jointly owned by GEC of Britain and General
Electric of the US.
The four partners have a combined turnover of FFr16.7bn, of which the
largest slice, FFr6bn comes from profitable Thomson Electromenager. They
have a combined 19.3 per cent share of the European market, second after
Electrolux-AEG, the German-Swedish combine, with 24.5 per cent.
This is the latest step in the trend for white goods producers to join
forces in various forms. It follows the 1988 acquisition of Philips'
domestic appliances businesses by Whirlpool of the US, and last June's joint
production and development deal between Electrolux and AEG.
The French-led alliance, which was called Temfa until being renamed Eurodom
yesterday, exists to allow its members to seek economies of scale in what is
a high volume, low-margin business.
They will pool their combined FFr9bn per year purchases of components to
obtain lower prices, share some research and development, exchange
information about each others' markets and exchange products on an OEM
basis.
The original members had already seen an improvement in domestic market
share, said Mr Henri Lagarde, chairman of Thomson Electromenager.
This means that Thomson Electromenager, for example, will be able to sell
Fagor or Ocean-made refrigerators, which are typically larger than French
ones, under its own label in Spain and Italy, according to an official at
the French group.
Fagor or Ocean will by the same token be able to sell Thomson-made washing
machines, as designed for the French market, under their own labels.
Eurodom is set up as a so-called European economic interest grouping, a
simplified structure allowed by European Community law for cross-frontier
alliances.
They do not, for the time being, plan to exchange equity stakes in each
other, though Mr Lagarde said this would be 'desirable'.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Austria reveals new-found zeal
for privatisation - The state seems ready to sell controll of most of its
holdings and it has given up any dreams, of building up Austrian-controlled
world competitive giants in finance and industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a bit late in the day, but Austria seems finally about to undertake a
serious privatisation programme.
This news may come as a surprise to those who know that the Austrian
government has in the past few years sold off significant stakes in its vast
holdings of the country's leading banks and industrial companies. But in
almost all of these cases, the government has retained majority or voting
control. Given the strong socialist - some would say collectivist - strain
in Austrian management-labour-government relations, it probably would have
continued to do so if the recession had not rudely disrupted its plans.
The event that provoked the policy shift was the revelation earlier this
year that Austrian Industries, a conglomerate of metal and oil companies
that was being readied for Austrian-style privatisation, had plunged into
heavy losses. That meant the government, which was counting on the proceeds
of a partial sale of AI equity to help cover its deficit, had to resort to
more radical measures.
Now, with a couple of exceptions, it seems ready to sell control of most of
its holdings. And it has given up any dreams it may still have held of
building up Austrian-controlled world competitive giants in finance and
industry.
'The state has to look to what it can release,' said Mr Viktor Klima, the
minister responsible for nationalised industries.
While this statement would seem a truism in most western countries, it is
nearly revolutionary in Austria where state ownership is still widely seen
as a defence against foreign ownership and as a necessary pre-condition for
the cosy and usually effective social partnership among government,
industrial management and labour that has prevailed in the post-war period.
Indeed, the partnership worked so well that Austrian leaders totally
rejected the privatisation trend when it caught on elsewhere in the early
1980s.
It was only in 1985 when the sprawling steel and engineering group Voest
Alpine suffered large losses on unauthorised speculation in the London oil
market that serious questions began to be raised about who was actually in
charge. The result was a significant shift towards more commercial
disciplines - the creation of AI, massive rationalisation at Voest Alpine
and flotations of a minority of shares in leading banks, such as
Creditanstalt and the former Lander Bank, and utilities, such as the Verbund
and EVN.
But the government always maintained control and the social partnership
continued more or less intact. The only real addition in many cases was an
ill-fated international ambition. This was particularly true at the leading
banks, most of which came to grief with expansions in London and New York in
the late 1980s.
As late as last year, Mr Rudolf Streicher, the former nationalised
industries minister, could say of AI: 'Our aim is an Austrian dominated
industrial concern whose managers have to report to Vienna and Linz and not
to Amsterdam and Tokyo.'
Today, Mr Streicher's successor, Mr Klima, points out that AI's problems
stem largely from over-investment abroad. 'In the past five years, it
invested more than Sch20bn (Dollars 1.8bn) more than its cash flow. That is
why it got into trouble.'
The first application of the new policy is on AI itself. Instead of being
readied for flotation as a single large group, it is now being stripped down
to its core metal and engineering businesses, most of them inherited from
the old Voest Alpine. Other activities are being privatised separately.
In particular, OMV, the large oil and chemicals group which is one of the
two main sources of AI losses this year, is being detached and restructured.
Under a new chief executive, it is withdrawing from some of its
international ventures and concentrating on becoming a leading player in
central European oil products markets.
Large minority blocks of its shares are to be offered to potential strategic
partners, such as international oil or chemical companies, next year.
Austria Metall (AMAG), the aluminium group which was the other source of
AI's losses, is being drastically cut. Its Austrian smelter has been shut
and participations in at least two of three overseas smelters are to be
sold. Its successful packaging business is up for sale and it is looking for
partners for its extrusion and forging divisions.
Other smaller AI subsidiaries are to be sold, floated or put into joint
ventures with foreign partners. Last month, shares of Voest Alpine
Eisenbahnsysteme (VAE), a small subsidiary of AI that makes high technology
railway points (switches), were offered to the public. AMS, a specialised
semiconductor maker, is on the ramp to follow early next year.
Mr Klima still seems determined to sell off some of AI within the next year
and it could be possible. AI executives are making optimistic noises about
their steel and steel-related technology businesses. But he says that unless
equity markets improve, the first step will probably have to be a private
placement of 10 to 20 per cent of the equity.
In all of these cases, except OMV, the government is prepared, at least in
principle, to sell a majority of its holdings. Mr Klima, OMV's finance
director before he joined the government last spring, says the oil company
is vital to Austria's energy security.
The government also seems willing to give up its control of the big banks.
Speculation has been rife in Vienna for weeks of the government selling a
part of its 49 per cent stake in Creditanstalt to a foreign company. And it
confirmed that Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, had discussions in
September with General Electric of the US, among others.
But as always in Austria, the implementation of this new enthusiasm for real
privatisation may not come quickly.
It is notable, for example, that the flotation of VAE involves only 49 per
cent of the shares. Sources close to the issue say the anxieties of the
trade unions prevented it from being higher.
Which goes to show it is still not easy for commercial values to make
headway against the social partnership.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Third prong goes for the balance sheet -
Andrew Jack considers the expected impact of Fred 3 on capital instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GURUS IN some of the City's better-known financial institutions have been
heard to answer the telephone in recent years with three revealing and
unsettling words: 'Financial engineering department.'
Their raison d'etre is to produce haemaphroditic capital instruments, the
chameleon-like hybrids which often exhibit all the characteristics of debt.
By taking advantage of loopholes in existing accounting rules and company
legislation, they are able to make these instruments appear on the balance
sheet as equity. This keeps gearing low and can diminish any risk of
breaching loan covenants.
It is precisely these financiers and their evolving devices that the
Accounting Standards Board hopes to put out of business with Fred 3, its
financial reporting exposure draft on capital instruments, issued last week.
Mr David Tweedie, the ASB chairman, says Fred 3 represents the start of the
ASB's attack on the third prong of accounting. FRS 2, the financial
reporting standard on cash flow, replaced the old source and application of
funds statement. FRS 3 dealt with the profit and loss account. Now Fred 3
begins the assault on the balance sheet.
'We had to act,' he says. 'One of the biggest problems for auditors was the
shifts between debt and equity of these instruments. It was getting to
ridiculous proportions.'
At the heart of Fred 3 is a simple boxed statement drawn from the ASB's
statement of principles, which defines liabilities as 'an entity's
obligations to transfer economic benefits as a result of past transactions
or events'. That turns most instruments into debt.
The standards-setters hands were partly tied when it came to shares and
their derivatives, which cannot be defined under the present law as
liabilities. The result is six categories into which capital instruments
will be classified:
shareholders' funds: equity and non-equity interests
minority interests in subsidiaries: equity and non-equity interests in
subsidiaries
liabilities: convertible and non-convertible liabilities.
Fred 3 also incorporates into a standard the first ruling from the ASB's
urgent issues task force issued in July last year, which deals with the
treatment of supplemental interest or premium on convertible bonds. It says
that these elements should be charged annually to the profit and loss
account from inception.
An illustration of the impact of the new standard is shown by BET, the
business services company. Its 1991 annual report simply shows Pounds 189m
in share capital and Pounds 437.4m in the share premium account.
The 1992 accounts have been re-cast along the lines suggested by Fred 3. The
1991 accounts now show equity shareholders' funds of Pounds 186.1m, and
Pounds 152.9m in the share premium account. Non-equity funds, in the form of
preference shares, total Pounds 287.4m, including just Pounds 2.9m for the
nominal value of the shares.
Theoretically, readers of accounts could always have calculated the
contribution from preference shares for themselves. The awkward reality is
illustrated by the 1991 Ratners accounts. The balance sheet shows called up
share capital of Pounds 66.2m and a share premium account of Pounds 356.9m.
These figures are linked to three tightly-worded pages in the notes which
list the six different authorised types of complex equity instruments, such
as 36m 6.75p convertible cumulative non-voting redeemable preference shares.
Those allotted are shown simply at their par value, making the market value
of each extremely difficult to calculate.
More fundamental than the switch from equity to non-equity shareholders'
funds for many companies will be the switch from equity back to debt. Among
those affected when Fred 3 becomes a mandatory standard next year is British
Airways. Its 1992 accounts show Pounds 320m in convertible capital bonds
maturing in 2005. These will have to be reclassified as debt.
The 1992 accounts for BICC show Pounds 177m in convertible capital bonds
which will have to be re-cast as borrowings. The notes also show that Pounds
33m of its Pounds 134m in minority interests now under capital and reserves
will also become debt. That will increase BICC's gearing from 43.4 per cent
to 106.7 per cent
The same fate faces Pounds 109.9m in redeemable convertible preference
shares in Coats Viyella Finance, guaranteed shares issued by a subsidiary of
Coats Viyella.
Thorn EMI will have to reclassify as debt from the 1992 accounts Pounds
211.5m in convertible unsecured loan stock and Pounds 103m in guaranteed
redeemable convertible preference shares in minority interests. It will also
have to account under non-equity shareholders' funds Pounds 114m in auction
preferred stock shown as a minority interest in capital and reserves.
Some of the other obscure instruments mentioned are debt issued with
warrants; deep discount, income and stepped interest bonds; index-linked
loans; and subordinated, limited recourse and repackaged perpetual debt.
But the point of Fred 3 is to lay down principles, not simply classify
existing instruments, which could rapidly become out-dated as new devices
are invented. Instead it attempts to provide a comprehensive set of
categories.
The ASB says most submissions it has received since issuing a discussion
document last December have been positive. Its only principal modification
in Fred 3 has been to allow short-term borrowings under a long-term
financing facility to be reported as long-term.
The lack of complaint suggests the financial engineers have so far kept
quiet. The chance to have their say may come once Fred 3 has become a
standard towards the end of next year and put out to test.

RICHARDS, the Aberdeen-based textile group which is trying to restructure
its way out of recession, turned a Pounds 434,000 pre-tax profit into a
Pounds 125,000 deficit in the 12 months to September 30.
Although turnover was held at Pounds 72m, operating profit fell from Pounds
1.26m to Pounds 125,000.
The group spent Pounds 250,000, taken an an exceptional charge, in
repositioning its shirt brands upwards, out of the more competitive middle
market.
The Pounds 1.28m cost of the disposal of the Irish-based linen manufacturing
operation was taken below the line.
Mr Brian Gilbert, chairman, said the collapse in consumer confidence and
home spending on furnishings since April made for the worst trading period
so far encountered in the recession.
The proposed final dividend is held at 2.93p to maintain the total for the
year at 4p, again uncovered by earnings of 0.15p (2.25p) per share.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wills debt-swap banks sell shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS holding a third of the 5 per cent cumulative convertible redeemable
preference shares in Wills Group, the engineering equipment distributor,
have converted and sold their holdings at close to the market price. The
ordinary shares were unchanged at 14p.
Holders of 878,000 preference converted into 8.78m ordinary, or 11.9 per
cent of the enlarged equity, which were then placed at 12p a share.
The preference were issued when the banks swapped debt of Pounds 4.56m for
2.4m shares as part of a capital reconstruction in October last year.
Three of the eight banks involved converted yesterday. The remaining shares
are convertible or redeemable no later than November 2001.
Mr David Massie, chairman, said it would be wrong to see yesterday's
conversion as taking a loss - the original debt swap and conversion valued
the ordinary at 19p. At the time of the swap there was a rights issue at 3
1/2 p per share and the present price seemed a long way off, he said.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Reshuffle should put Porth back into black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FESTIVE CHEER is still eluding Porth Group, the Welsh-based company which is
Britain's biggest producer of Christmas decorations.
Porth has decided to close its main factory at Llwynpia, in Mid Glamorgan,
and move its operations three miles away to Treorchy, alongside existing
warehousing and distribution facilities. No jobs will be lost; the permanent
workforce has already been cut by 55 to 156 in the current year.
Porth, which came to the USM in 1989, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
1.34m last year, compared with Pounds 1.04m in 1990. The group said that,
despite improved trading, it still expected to be in loss this year,
particularly since there would be exceptional costs.
Mr John Miller, chief executive, said: 'The outlook for 1993 is markedly
improved following the move of the factory and, although an assumption has
been made that consumer spending will not increase in 1993, a profit is
expected.'
Porth, which raised Pounds 978,000 from shareholders in the summer, has
agreed funding arrangements for 1993 with its principal bankers, National
Westminster, and said it did not intend to seek further funds next year for
current operations.
The Welsh Development Agency has agreed to refurbish the new factory at
Treorchy and the Welsh Office is seeking to preserve jobs by granting Porth
Pounds 500,000 over three years.
Last year Porth appointed Sir Michael Edwardes, former head of British
Leyland, as its non-executive chairman and raised Pounds 3.5m in a rights
issue.
The shares closed 1p higher at 5 3/4 p, giving the group a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 1m, compared with its flotation value of
Pounds 13.8m.

The move follows its announcement in March that it would no longer sell
general insurance in the UK through brokers, after losses of Pounds 77m in
that business in 1991.
Prudential said it has reached an agreement with Kendal-based Provincial
Insurance, the 12th largest general insurer in the UK with premium income
last year of Pounds 331m.
Under the agreement Prudential will recommend its existing commercial policy
holders to switch to Provincial when their policies come up for renewal
after April next. Prudential will receive a commission for introducing new
business based on the volume of business written by Provincial.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Interest income buoys Electronic Data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC Data Processing, the Sheffield-based computer systems and
services group, produced sharply improved pre-tax profits in the year to
September 30 boosted by higher net interest receipts.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations and the share price
moved up only fractionally to close at 510p.
Turnover shrank by 11 per cent from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 15.5m, the
consequence, according to Mr Michael Heller, chairman, of 'the continuing
compression in the selling prices of hardware and the policy of the group to
develop long term as a software publisher and services provider'.
Profits before tax rose 20 per cent from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 4.88m;
trading profits rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 3.79) with a
further Pounds 784,000 (Pounds 290,000) in net interest receipts.
Earnings per share were 17 per cent up at 38.4p (32.83p) and a final
dividend of 3.1p is recommended to make a total of 5.1p, 20 per cent ahead
of last year's 4.25p.
Cash balances at September 30 were Pounds 10.2m after spending nearly Pounds
2m on a new corporate headquarters in Sheffield.
EDP is a company in transition. It is moving away from hardware distribution
towards software and services which last year contributed Pounds 8m to
turnover.
Last year it spent about Pounds 530,000 on research and development, chiefly
on the production of a new software product, Univision, a database
management system which will operate under either of the 'open' software
environments, Unix or Pick.
The future of the industry, Mr Heller said, lay in open - or industry
standard - systems and the company's aim was to become a software publisher
specialising in open products.
Trading conditions remained harsh and he confirmed analysts' views that
profits would be essentially flat in the present year. The company was
looking for acquisitions and had identified suitable candidates for
takeover, but would retain its cash pile until the moment was right.

Narborough Plantations, the Malaysian rubber and palm oil producer, reported
pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 up from Pounds 153,000 to Pounds
162,000.
Lower operating profits were offset by higher income from investments and an
exchange gain rather than a loss.
Turnover was Pounds 335,000 (Pounds 372,000). Earnings per share were 0.96p
(0.74p). The proposed final dividend is unchanged at 1p gross for a
maintained total of 1.5p gross.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: British Vita expands in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH VITA, the polymer, fibre and foam company, is to expand further into
eastern Europe through construction of a new foam products factory in
Poland.
The Manchester-based company said yesterday it had bought land 20kms from
Wroclaw, near the Czechoslovakian border, and will initially invest Pounds
4m to build a factory to serve the local furniture and bedding markets.
The move follows modest expansion in the last two years into east Germany,
where the group has cutting and conversion plants. It has been supplying the
local Polish market with exports from Germany and the Netherlands.
Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive, said Vita Polymers Poland would make its
own foam as well as importing it in block form. At a later stage, the
company might also export to neighbouring countries and sell its other
products like fibres into the local market.
'This will be a bridgehead,' said Mr Sellers. 'It will be a trading
organisation capable of importing.'
Further down the road, Mr Sellers said Vita Polymers Poland might expand to
serve the German vehicle market. 'There is a trend for German auto makers to
put more labour intensive operations into Poland,' he said.
The local Polish market is likely to demand products towards the lower end
of British Vita's range, but margins are likely to be satisfactory once
local labour is used and there is no longer a need for high transport and
import costs. Much of the raw material can be supplied from the local Polish
chemicals industry.
The expansion into Poland further extends British Vita's dependence on the
continental European market. With the German economy turning down and
tightness in a number of other countries, British Vita's stock market rating
has suffered recently from this exposure.
Mr Sellers said yesterday that while the German market was turning down,
domestic consumer demand was holding up relatively well.

<TEXT>
MR Duncan McGregor, chairman of Tuskar Resources, the Irish exploration
company in which shares have been suspended since August, faces a move to
oust him from the board at the annual meeting on Friday.
Mr John Lord, a stockbroker and dissident shareholder, has mounted the
challenge by mailing his own proxy voting form to shareholders. Initially he
wanted to change the direction of the company, but he apparently now wishes
to keep it in the resource sector. This, according to Tuskar is 'an
extraordinary about turn'.
In his own letter to shareholders yesterday, Mr McGregor countered, saying
that Mr Lord 'has no operating experience of the natural resource industry',
that his proposals for running the company 'would not generate an early cash
flow', and that 'it could be a considerable time before dealings would
recommence'.
He said the board was 'unequivocally committed to keeping Tuskar in natural
resources'. Retrenchment carried out by the board had placed the company in
a net cash position, would bring new exploration opportunities to be
announced shortly, and put the company in a position 'where it will shortly
apply for a recommencement of dealings'.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: More showers are feared before the sun
returns - Jane Fuller considers the problems at Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bill Rooney, chairman of Spring Ram Corporation, has needed every ounce
of his considerable marketing skills recently.
He has been trying to convince nearly 40 institutional investors that his
kitchens and bathrooms company has stumbled, not fallen, over the Balterley
Bathrooms affair.
'We are still the same company that we were five weeks ago' before the news
that false accounting at Balterley could cost a total of Pounds 5.6m and
before the share price fell from 156p to 89p.
With investors giving the company credit for its explanation of what
happened, the share price has recovered to 120p.
One institutional representative described Mr Rooney and his colleagues as
apologetic. 'No attempt was made to cover up what had been a badly handled
situation.'
Another commented: 'We are happy that the episode is isolated. To some
extent it was bad luck and to some extent looser management than we would
have hoped for.'
Spring Ram does, however, continue to trade at a discount to the market. It
used to command a premium, having multiplied pre-tax profit 12-fold between
1984 and 1991.
To allay the fears raised by Balterley, Mr Rooney and Mr Stuart Greenwood,
finance director, came to the City armed with a breakdown of the Balterley
losses, a timetable of the problem's discovery and belated revelation, and
fighting talk about the 'reality' of the group's profits. 'It has not been
done by Mickey Mouse creative accounting,' said Mr Greenwood.
The Balterley explanation was to some extent familiar. The subsidiary's
finance director, since sacked, had inflated profits by altering the numbers
for stock - to the tune of Pounds 3.9m over three years - sales, debtors and
creditors.
Other Balterley board members were exonerated. Head office, which did
without a finance director until Mr Greenwood's arrival in March last year,
was partly to blame for ordering the stock build-up and then simply
accepting the numbers it had wanted to see.
Mr Greenwood said he should have spotted the seriousness of the problem
sooner. Blame was deflected from Mr David Riley, who has been the board
member responsible for bathrooms since March 1989.
The affair has added urgency to the calls for Spring Ram to be more
accountable. Shareholders are developing what one described as 'a wish list'
of things they would like to see now that the company is being more open.
Mr Rooney said that at least one non-executive director, its first, would be
announced by next March. He also seemed amenable to providing a divisional
breakdown of profits and sales for the first time in the 1992 accounts.
This will indicate that well over half the profits come from kitchens,
driven by rising volumes at the huge Scunthorpe factory, and from Astracast
sinks.
Spring Ram has shown an increasing willingness to admit that the bathrooms
side has succumbed to the UK recession. For the first time the group has had
to make redundancies - at Spring Bathrooms as well as at Balterley.
The group has also been subject to profit-forecast downgrades for the first
time. The latest consensus is that the growth in pre-tax profit will slow to
6.5 per cent this year, giving Pounds 40m before exceptionals. Expectations
for 1993 have been shaded down to between Pounds 47m and Pounds 48m.
Mr Rooney admits that the pressure has been on this year. The bulge in
capital spending - Pounds 40m compared with only Pounds 3m in 1990 - was not
supposed to coincide with recession. It is, however, to the group's credit
that it had saved cash for the purpose.
The two start-up factories, doors and tiles, have made losses this year,
albeit eased by Pounds 2m in grants.
'We have put down 800,000 sq ft this year. That takes courage in a
depression and we will spend a similar amount next year because we are
planing for the next eight years.'
After delivering the presentation to the institutions, Mr Rooney will have
to go through it all again as analysts file up to Yorkshire. Their questions
are likely to go beyond Balterley to issues concerning the 1992 accounts
such as the profits breakdown, stock levels, depreciation and deferred tax.
They are also concerned about Spring Ram's 1993 prospects. Has the company
gone ex-growth in its core markets? Why has it acquired Stag Furniture? Will
it make much money out of door production?
But the question of credibility may come back to Balterley, especially as
the questions the directors stonewalled on this summer were not so wide of
the mark.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 4.7m loss at British Bio-tech 'well
within budget'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Bio-technology, the recently floated pharmaceuticals group,
yesterday announced pre-tax losses for the first six months to October 31 of
Pounds 4.7m, compared with Pounds 5.7m last time.
Losses per share fell from 23.2p to 14.3p.
The company said the losses were well within budget, but warned they would
be substantially higher for the second six months as the clinical trial
programme was expanded. The balance sheet remained strong with Pounds 55m on
deposit, it added.
Mr James Noble, finance director, said: 'This was the year we discovered our
drugs were safe. Next year we discover if they work.
Our shares should act like those of a US biotechnology groups as the
clinical trail results materialise. They'll either shoot up or plummet.'
Research and development expenditure on new drugs was Pounds 8.7m compared
with Pounds 7.7m last year.
Income increased from Pounds 342,000 to Pounds 1.58m, mainly because an
agreement with Glaxo worth Pounds 900,000 and an EC funded Aids programme
worth Pounds 700,000. Net cash outflow for the six months was Pounds 9.2m.
Operating costs had been kept substantially below budget, said the group.
Interest receivable increased from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 2.48m, as the
company benefited income generated by the flotation in July.
The company has a number of products in development, including anti-cancer
drugs, a treatment for acute shock, an asthma medicine and an Aids therapy.
Phase II trials to test for the Aids treatment's effectiveness began last
week and will include 72 asymptomatic HIV-positive patients and 100 Aids
sufferers. Trials in the US involving about 75 patients should start next
year.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Anglo United Pounds 22.7m in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO UNITED, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, yesterday
confirmed details of a restructuring plan which was mainly responsible for a
Pounds 22.7m pre-tax loss for the half year to September 30.
Last year's Pounds 3m pre-tax profit was wiped out by the cost of
restructuring, included in an exceptional charge of Pounds 11.2m, compared
to a gain of Pounds 6.2m from disposals.
Only six months after Anglo won approval from its banks to pay off
short-term borrowings from disposals, it was forced to reschedule its debts
after customers cut their orders and Pounds 50m of disposals fell through at
the last moment.
Anglo was faced with a Pounds 16.3m interest bill and Pounds 7m outstanding
from this year's debt repayment, as operating profits fell from Pounds 13.4m
to Pounds 4.68m. Sales declined to Pounds 243.5m (Pounds 269.1m).
The group had expected to sell Liquid Fuels to a regional electricity
company for Pounds 42m in August. The day before contracts were to be signed
the electricity company said it would only pay Pounds 23m, which Anglo
refused to accept. A week later further disposals, worth Pounds 8.5m, fell
through.
Mr David McErlain, chairman, said: 'This was a very clear signal, if we
needed one, that selling businesses in the current climate is impossible. It
was at this point we decided to go straight back to the banks to restructure
our debts.'
Under the terms of the proposed agreement Anglo's debt of Pounds 250m -
which includes Pounds 10m of interest payments due in February - would be
reduced to Pounds 180m of which Pounds 50m would have deferred interest
payments.
Pounds 45m would be converted into new ordinary shares at a premium to
Anglo's share price, which yesterday closed 1 1/2 p down at 6p.
Pounds 25m would be issued in zero coupon convertible loan notes which could
be converted between now and within ten years at a premium to the existing
share price. Warrants would also be issued to shareholders on the same
terms.
Interest payments on Pounds 50m of debt would be deferred for up to 10
years.
Existing preference shares would be converted into new ordinary shares on
enhanced conversion terms.
Losses per share were 7.1p (earnings 1.3p). The interim dividend is passed
(0.2p).
COMMENT
Even back in the good old days of the late eighties borrowing Pounds 440m
debt to acquire a company for Pounds 500m was not without its risks. But the
combination of three years of recession and last year's exceptional mild
winter has finally scuppered Anglo's hopes of keeping to its debt repayment
schedule. In the circumstances its proposed deal with its banks does not
look too bad. If the loan notes and warrants are not converted, shareholders
will keep control of the company, unlike at Heron, for example, where the
banks and bondholders are being offered 95 per cent of the equity. Anglo's
banks are only likely to convert their loan notes if there is a big increase
in the share price - which pre-supposes a bid or a very cold winter.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Scottish Provident buys Prolific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH PROVIDENT, the medium-sized mutually owned life insurance company,
yesterday announced conditional agreement to buy Prolific, the UK life
insurance subsidiary of Hafnia, the stricken Danish insurer, for Pounds
81.75m.
The deal is one of the biggest acquisitions by any mutually owned insurer in
recent years and increases funds under management at Scottish Provident from
more than Pounds 3.1bn to more than Pounds 4.25bn.
The first of a series of disposals planned by Hafnia since it suspended
payments to creditors and transferred its assets to a new holding company in
August, it ends a period of uncertainty for the Kendal-based Prolific.
Mr David Woods, managing director of Scottish Provident, described the deal
as a 'perfect match' and said the companies' product lines were 'very
complementary'.
Both companies generate most of their sales through independent financial
advisers, but while Edinburgh-based Scottish Provident is known for its
strength in the with-profits area, Prolific is stronger in the unit-linked,
unit trust and PEP sectors. Scottish Provident is prominent in single
premium with profits investment products, in which it has a share of between
4 and 5 per cent.
Sales of single premium products increased by 274 per cent to reach Pounds
374m in the first nine months of 1992. New worldwide annual premiums rose by
7.5 per cent to reach Pounds 29m in the same period.
Prolific's three operating companies consist of a Kendal-based life
insurance company, a London-based fund manager and an Isle of Man-based
offshore life insurer. Scottish Provident will pay an initial consideration
of Pounds 75.5m on completion with a further payment of Pounds 6.25m on the
first anniversary. The acquisition will be financed in cash from existing
resources. Cash in excess of Pounds 20m is also included in the Prolific
businesses.
Scottish Provident's actuarial assessment of Prolific, by R Watson and Sons,
showed the value of future profits on business already on the company's book
to be 'well in excess of Pounds 60m', said Mr Woods.
Mr David Nisbet, analyst with County NatWest, said the deal contained
'strategic benefits' and 'looks reasonable value'.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Landlords hold the key to easing rent burdens on shops:
Incentives being offered to tenants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR HARD-PRESSED retailers, the importance of Christmas is not just the
seasonal boost to sales. It is also one of the year's quarter days, when
rent falls due.
This year, the strains on overstretched traders have been evident in their
attempts to persuade landlords to relieve their rent burden for a temporary
period.
Many landlords are taking a sympathetic approach, as long as they had full
access to the tenant's books and were convinced of the company's sincerity.
'We are doing a lot of deferment deals,' says Mr John Parry, managing
director of Hammerson, one of the UK's largest property companies. 'We don't
forgive rent but we will help tenants through a difficult cash flow period.'
The most notable example is Ratners, the jewellery chain, which met with a
mixed response from landlords when it asked to defer rent payments to
finance its Christmas stock.
Some believed it was worth helping the company out rather than being left
with a lot of shops they were unable to let.
Others were sceptical that a quarter's rent would be make-or-break for
Ratners and wished to collect their debts while they could.
As landlords grapple with record numbers of empty shops, they are watching
the fortunes of traders with particular care. 'The pre-Christmas period is
critical,' says Mr Parry.
The landlords' concern about their unlet properties is prompting many to
sign up retailers, typically selling items such as gifts, bargain books and
cards, on leases of just a few months. 'The short-term letting market has
been very buoyant indeed,' said Mr Graham Chase of Erdman Lewis
International, the property advisers.
The attraction for the tenant is that it can test the market and benefit
from Christmas sales. The landlord benefits from a livelier shopping centre,
reduced outgoings and the possibility that the tenant will decide to take a
permanent lease. However, other tenants often object to the newcomers taking
away their business, without supporting the overheads throughout the year.
Even if retailers do well over the Christmas period, their landlords will
have to work increasingly hard to stand still.
Many empty shops have been filled with specialist retailers which have
expanded with the help of rent-free periods and cash payments from desperate
landlords - only to collapse when these incentives have run their course.
By March quarter day, several more retailers are likely to disappear,
regardless of the success of the Christmas trading period.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Retailers hope for the merry ringing of tills: The good
cheer that the UK Christmas sales period traditionally brings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Father Christmas harnesses his reindeer on Christmas Eve, retailers up
and down the land will be counting their seasonal takings.
Christmas is the vital trading period for most non-food retailers in the UK,
and some make as much as 90 per cent of their annual profits at this time.
'Christmas makes or breaks the bottom line for almost every retailer,' says
Mr John Richards, retail analyst at County NatWest WoodMac.
Five years after retailers first began talking about recession, this year's
concern that some troubled retailers could fail if Christmas is poor is
likely to prove unfounded.
Most large chains have already taken the necessary actions - the likes of
Next, Burton and Storehouse have seen their share prices soar this year. A
question mark does hang over Ratners, the jewellery group, particularly
after the recent sudden resignation of its chief executive.
Small independent retailers are less likely to have built up the unwieldy
cost structures that have caused headaches for the large chains. Stores in
some sectors, such as do-it-yourself, are not heavily dependent on
Christmas.
Trade this Christmas will be scrutinised for signs of recovery in consumer
spending. Yet, however low the level of consumer confidence, a build-up in
sales in the weeks leading up to Christmas is guaranteed, as the chart of
retail sales shows.
In BhS, the Storehouse chain store subsidiary, sales in the peak Christmas
trading week are around three times those of the lowest week of the year,
and even a 'bad' Christmas would have a ratio close to that.
At Argos, the catalogue store retailer, the five weeks before Christmas
provide about a quarter of the year's volume of sales. Mr Bob Stewart,
finance director, says the difference between a 'good' and 'bad' Christmas
is only a few percentage points in volume terms. Mr Richards says:
'Curiously, there has not been a bad Christmas (in recent years). Last year
there was a lot of discounting but there is never an enormous drop in
volume.'
The essential question for retailers is whether the high level of sales will
translate into high profits. Argos's quarter of annual sales usually
translates into about two-thirds of annual profits. For Ratners, Christmas
has represented as much as 90 per cent of annual profits in past years, and
Woolworths, part of the Kingfisher group, makes its entire annual profit
between October and January.
Even a chain such as Boots the Chemist, which sells everyday items bought
all year round, makes around half its year's profits in the Christmas
selling period, with W H Smith, the newsagent and stationer, making a third.
Sales made at Christmas are highly profitable because of the operational
gearing effect of the high fixed overheads in retailing. As the table shows,
the peak week's sales produce a much higher net profit margin on the same
gross margin, as fixed overheads are spread equally over the year. Although
there are some extra costs in the Christmas period - such as staffing - the
net margin is much higher.
Every extra transaction makes a higher net margin until, as Mr Stanley
Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailer, says, 'by Christmas Eve
the gross margin comes through to the net'.
Profits depend, though, on the gross margin being held. Mr Robert Shrager,
finance director of Dixons, says: 'Christmas is really a matter of
expectations versus reality. If you expect it to be bad and it is bad than
that's not bad. But if you expect it to be good and it's bad, that's bad.'
If retailers build stocks for Christmas and find they are not selling they
will sacrifice margins one way or another. This year they appear to have
been cautious about stock levels.
In recent Christmases retailers have resorted to price cutting to shift
stock. That cuts into margins making the period less profitable than it
should have been. Last year there was a general dip in sales in November and
by the start of December the discounting was well under way, including the
now infamous ploy by Ratners to cut prices by 25 per cent on Saturdays. This
year discounting activity appears to be more selective.
Most shops will open on the last three or four Sundays before Christmas this
year, although Marks and Spencer and John Lewis have taken a principled
stand against the trend. Marks and Spencer shops are opening long hours on
the other days though, with some in shopping centres staying open until
10pm.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Fisons sells UK consumer healthcare unit for Pounds 90m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the pharmaceuticals and scientific group, yesterday continued its
restructuring with the sale of its UK consumer healthcare business to
Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland for Pounds 90m. Fisons shares rose 2p to
212p.
Fisons' consumer healthcare business, which included over the counter (OTC)
products such as Sanatogen vitamins and Radian analgesic, had a turnover of
Pounds 26.6m last year and generated operating profits of Pounds 5m before
the allocation of central costs.
Roche acquires the brands and existing stock. Fisons retains Pounds 6m owed
to the business by debtors. The UK group will also continue to manufacture
Sanatogen for nine months and Paracodol, an analgesic, for 18 months until
Roche can start production. About 160 employees at Fisons' Loughborough
Sanatogen site will then be made redundant. The proceeds from the disposal
will be used to cut Fisons' borrowings.
Roche's acquisition will almost double its UK OTC turnover which last year
was Pounds 30m. The purchase is part of the Swiss group's strategy to expand
its presence in OTC medicines. Last year Roche acquired Nicholas, the
European OTC business of the US group Sara Lee, for Dollars 790m (Pounds
505m). Roche's worldwide OTC business should generate sales of SFr1bn
(Pounds 454m) this year.
Fisons's move follows the sale last month of its US and Canadian consumer
health businesses for Dollars 140m to Ciba-Geigy Corporation, the US
subsidiary of the Swiss chemicals group.
The UK group still has to sell its Australian, South African and French
consumer health operations. However, Mr Roy Thomas, finance director, said
the group was considering a number of bids.
Fisons is also looking to sell its horticultural business which has a
turnover of about Pounds 85m.
Mr Thomas said Fisons was talking to other groups about collaborating in
fields such as manufacturing, marketing and drug development. The group is
talking to one US company which might manufacture Imferon, Fisons' blood
product. Imferon was withdrawn from the US in 1990 following quality control
concerns.
Fisons is still waiting to hear from the US Food and Drug Administration if
its inspectors want to revisit the manufacturing facilities for Opticrom, an
allergic eye treatment that has also been withdrawn in the US.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Tiphook lifts interim dividend in spite of pre-tax profits
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIPHOOK, the freight container and trailer rental company, yesterday raised
its interim dividend 11.4 per cent in spite of a fall in profits.
Pre-tax profits fell 10 per cent from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 35.2m in the
six months to October 31. The container division performed well but the
trailer rental division was affected by UK recession and a weakening in
Germany.
Mr Robert Montague, chairman, said the second half of the year, which is the
more important, had started well with signs of improvement in the UK. 'We're
going to have the best Christmas for two years,' he said.
The dividend increase, from 4.4p to 4.9p, was a continuation of Tiphook's
policy of raising dividends now that a period of heavy capital expenditure
has been largely completed. The increase, which followed a 25 per cent rise
last year, lifted Tiphook's volatile shares 10p to 294p, compared with this
year's high of 476p.
Turnover increased 6 per cent to Pounds 170.7m while operating profits grew
less than 1 per cent to Pounds 62m.
The container division's sales increased 11 per cent to Pounds 94.6m, helped
by strong growth in intra-Asian trade. But operating profits increased only
3 per cent to Pounds 45.6m. Rental rates were steady, but delays integrating
new capacity led to a 3 per cent fall in utilisation rates to 85 per cent.
The trailer rental division was hit by lower utilisation rates because of
recession but rental rates improved 9 per cent. The division incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.8m compared with a profit of Pounds 300,000.
Tiphook's rail freight division reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 400,000,
which included a Pounds 600,000 provision against Charterail, the private
freight operator which collapsed in August.
Net borrowings increased more than Pounds 150m to Pounds 828.3m. More than
Pounds 100m of the rise was because of higher US dollar conversion rates
following sterling's fall. The gearing ratio increased from 2.8 times to 3
times shareholders funds but remained 'comfortably' within banking
requirements, the company said.
Interest charges increased 12 per cent to Pounds 26.9m, with interest cover
falling from 2.6 times to 2.3 times. Earnings per share fell from 26.1p to
22.4p. Capital expenditure is expected to be Pounds 90m this year, compared
with Pounds 228m last year.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Pits face rise in power charges: Electricity costs review
for British Coal deepens controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is facing significant increases in its own electricity charges
at a time when the bulk of the coal it sells to generators is due to fall in
price.
Disclosure of proposed price rises by National Power and PowerGen, the two
main electricity generators for England and Wales, will increase controversy
surrounding electricity pricing and negotiations for coal-fired power
supplies.
British Coal believes early talks with the generators on its electricity
supplies indicate it may face rises of twice the rate of inflation from
April.
In common with other industrial concerns using more than 1MW of electricity
a year, British Coal negotiates directly with suppliers, rather than paying
charges fixed by electricity companies in talks with the industry regulator.
Many other large users are facing similar significant rises.
In an initial offer to British Coal, PowerGen has outlined a deal for the
Nottinghamshire area which British Coal officials have estimated will add
7.5 per cent to electricity prices from April.
National Power is thought to be considering higher offers for other British
Coal regions, though in many cases its current prices to British Coal are
lower than those of PowerGen. In the case of both companies, the offers
would be for supplying the electricity and exclude distribution costs.
The negotiations come in the wake of a report last week by Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the electricity regulator, which questioned whether National
Power and PowerGen were passing on to the consumer the effect of next
April's predicted coal price cuts.
National Power and PowerGen said yesterday the cuts were being passed on.
They pointed out, however, that the reduced-price coal was used in the
'franchise' electricity market.
Large customers, such as British Coal, were not affected. They already pay
much less per unit of electricity than domestic and small industrial
customers.
This is because coal for sale in the non-franchise market is bought at world
prices which are lower than British Coal's.
Some large users of electricity are suggesting that the fall in British Coal
prices should enable prices to large, as well as small, customers to fall
and are putting pressure on the regulator to allow this to happen.
National Power said it had made no formal offers to British Coal. PowerGen
said it could not comment while talks were in progress.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Little Rock conference sees much talk, fewer policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LITTLE ROCK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS president-elect Bill Clinton convened his two-day 'economic conference'
yesterday, it rapidly became clear it was an exercise in communication -
live from Little Rock - and not an occasion for policy-making.
Above all, it was a chance for Mr Clinton to demonstrate his mastery of
detail and his determination to be a president who remains in touch with the
people. Continuing the pattern of this year's election campaign, this was
achieved by including a nationwide phone-in on the television broadcast.
Mr Clinton, vice-president-elect Al Gore and their economic team listened to
Main Street America's ideas about the country's economic problems as well as
the opinions of leading academics.
From the beginning, Mr Clinton seemed in his element, frequently challenging
the academic presenters and offering lengthy clarifications for his
television audience.
When Professor Alan Blinder of Princeton University raised the need for
greater investment in education and training, Mr Clinton asked why, when
only 15 per cent of employers reported difficulty in finding skilled
workers. It was a typical intervention from Mr Clinton, who appeared
frustrated at times that many speakers were echoing - or exaggerating - his
own arguments rather than offering new ideas.
This, of course, was his own mistake in insisting that only Democrats - or
people known to sympathise with his views - were invited.
With this caveat, participants were diverse, ranging from Ms Kathleen Piper,
owner of the Pied Piper Flower Shop in Yankton, South Dakota, to
industrialists such as Mr Henry Poling, chairman of Ford Motor Company.
Labour unions were also well represented.
Hundreds of journalists, representing organisations ranging from the local
Arkansas Democrat Gazette to CNN to the Chinese Daily News, milled around
Little Rock in search of two scarce commodities: decent hotel rooms and hard
news.
Many seemed uncertain of the purpose of the conference and bemused by the
bureaucracy imposed by the Clinton media people.
In his opening remarks, Mr Clinton repeated his view that encouraging signs
of economic recovery must not be allowed to divert attention from
longer-term structural problems. Calling again for more investment in
education, training and infrastructure, he seemed, however, to put greater
emphasis than before on reducing the budget deficit.
'We must stop the cycle of borrow-and-spend economics,' he said. 'Our
national debt is an economic ball and chain dragging us down, keeping
long-term interest rates high in spite of the actions of the Federal Reserve
in bringing down short-term rates.'
This means 'we're going to have to make some tough decisions and some hard
choices'.
But judging by yesterday's glorified talking shop, the Little Rock
conference seems unlikely to be the place these hard choices will be made.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Brussels to probe BA's takeover of Dan-Air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has launched an inquiry into the competitive
implications on air services between Belgium and the UK of British Airways'
acquisition of Dan-Air, the financially ailing UK-based regional carrier.
The unexpected move after an earlier Commission decision not to investigate
the takeover is a setback for BA at a time when the UK carrier is seeking to
win Washington's approval for its Dollars 750m (Pounds 481m) acquisition of
a 44 per cent stake in USAir.
The US government is expected to announce a decision on the BA-USAir deal in
the next 10 days.
BA, which last week also made a bid for a 25 per cent stake in Qantas, the
Australian carrier, described the investigation as 'totally unjustified'.
Sir Leon Brittan, European Community competition commissioner, announced
last month there would be no inquiry into the takeover because Dan-Air's
annual turnover was less than Ecu 250m (Pounds 200m), the trigger for an
investigation under EC merger regulations.
BA, which took over Dan-Air for a nominal Pounds 1 and assumed the airline's
liabilities, is now restructuring Dan-Air's operations as part of a new
low-cost airline based at London's Gatwick airport.
Belgium, however, invoked a special clause never before used in the
two-year-old EC merger regulations to prompt an investigation of the deal.
Article 22 of the merger regulations allows any member state to request an
inquiry into the effects of a merger or takeover on competition on their
national territory.
The Commission, which has a month to reach an initial verdict, confirmed the
inquiry would only assess the impact of the BA takeover on the Belgian
market.
However, it is now likely to be seized upon by other opponents of the
takeover to renew calls for a broader investigation.
Virgin Atlantic and British Midland had both unsuccessfully sought an EC
inquiry as well as a referral of the deal to the UK Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Air France, which owns a stake in Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, has also
complained to Sir Leon about the decision not to launch a full investigation
into the Dan-Air takeover and BA's recent acquisition of a minority stake in
TAT, an independent French regional airline.
BA yesterday maintained that even a limited inquiry was unjustified because
there was already a great deal of competition on the London-Brussels route
and scope for expansion.

FT  15 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Renting boxes and trailers should be a straightforward business but
Tiphook's aggressive growth and accounting policies have lent it a certain
mystique. As a result, its shares have been buffeted far more by sentiment
than fundamentals.
Even though interim profits dipped 10 per cent, Tiphook's shares remain
strikingly cheap on conventional measures of analysis. Most reasonable
expectations of this year's earnings leave its forward multiple languishing
at less than six while its dividend yield - at 9 per cent - is about twice
the market average. Despite the increasing clarity of its accounts, UK
investors continue to harbour an aversion against a leasing company which
carries close to Pounds 1bn of debt and gearing of 300 per cent on a stock
market value of Pounds 323m.
On the other side of the Atlantic, Tiphook is seen as a different story.
Even though its earnings under US accounting rules are only about half those
stated in the UK, its Wall Street followers focus on the strong cash flow
and well-covered dividend. Heavy buying by US investors has lifted their
holding to 30 per cent and may yet prompt a reassessment in the UK. That,
though, would have to await a general economic recovery, when gearing would
work in Tiphook's favour rather than against it.

FT  15 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: European mergers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's decision to re-open its investigation of the
British Airways-Dan-Air merger will do little to allay the fears of those
who worry that its competition policy is politically driven. The request was
made by the Belgian government, as indeed is its right under the hitherto
neglected article 22 of the EC merger regulation. However it is not hard to
detect the hidden hand of the Belgian flag carrier Sabena and its
shareholder, Air France.
They may have difficulty arguing that the merger will impede competition in
the Belgian market. Before it acquired Dan-Air, BA had seven daily flights
between London Heathrow and Brussels - the same as Sabena. Now it has
acquired four flights from Gatwick, yet the merged British carrier still
accounts for less than one third of the traffic between the two capitals.
Last month the EC found no reason to block the deal at a European level. Now
it seems slightly embarrassed at having to revisit the issue. The outcome is
unlikely to be anything tougher than a requirement on BA to give up some of
its London-Brussels slots, if that. The City was right to shrug off the
implications yesterday, but Sabena may have found a temporary spoiling
tactic and Belgium's action shows the battle to confine European merger
control to competition issues is still not won.

FT  15 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons will have to deliver more than well-timed disposals to convince the
market that it is, if not completely out of the woods, at least in
possession of a map. Granted, it could hardly choose a better time to sell
its consumer health interests. The generous multiples paid by Roche for the
UK consumer brands yesterday and by Ciba-Geigy for the north American
business last month underline the scramble among pharmaceuticals giants to
carve a position in over-the-counter medicines. Assuming the horticulture
division also fetches a decent price, Fisons will soon be free of debt.
However neither the consumer health business nor the balance sheet were ever
the root of Fisons' problems.
For all the new faces at board level and lower down the hierarchy, there is
no conclusive evidence that the rift with the US Food and Drug
Administration has healed. Valuable time and earnings are being lost, not
least because Opticrom's US patent expires next year. With scientific
equipment likely to remain under pressure, earnings recovery hinges on an
early and successful US launch for Tilade, the asthma therapy.
The US regulator seems unlikely to muster enough seasonal goodwill to clear
both Opticrom and Tilade before the year end. Even if it did, there can be
no certainty that Fisons has sufficient marketing skills to make the best of
the opportunity. Co-marketing agreements with other drug companies - under
consideration but not yet concluded - would help. A yield of 5.3 per cent
and a secure dividend should provide support for the shares, but on past
performance the market can hardly be blamed for taking little on trust.

FT  15 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Off the summit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It did not take financial markets long yesterday to decide that the
Edinburgh summit was a more of a political than an economic policy success.
True, the meeting agreed on a package to bolster growth, but the short-run
effect will be minimal. The pressing problems of currency uncertainty
against a backdrop of high unemployment and tight money were not addressed,
so it cames as no surprise that, after an initial rise, the French franc
quickly fell back. It closed still in the danger area at over FFr3.41 to the
D-mark.
If that indicates a market belief that pressures on the system are likely to
continue, the French bond market seems to be taking its own view of how the
authorities will react. Last week, French bond prices rose on the
expectation of a devaluation which would allow short term rates to fall.
Yesterday, bond prices fell around half a point on the prospect of continued
monetary squeeze. Good inflation figures, perversely, did not help; they
were simply a reminder that, with real short rates of 9 per cent, money is
almost unbearably tight.
How long that situation can last is a moot point. Devaluations elsewhere in
Europe have eroded French competitiveness; the Irish and Danish currencies
still look vulnerable. Were they to devalue, the franc could be brutally
exposed. Then again, Edinburgh's agreements may redouble the political will
to hold the line. The next speculative attack will almost certainly not now
be mounted before the new year and Germany's economic situation is
deteriorating fast; the IFO economic institute now expects a half point fall
in real economic output next year. That might keep alive just enough
expectation of lower German rates to defer the final assault on the franc. A
sharp deceleration in money growth would help even more - but that still
looks like wishful thinking.

<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Robinson (Letters, December 11) is not alone in bemoaning the
punitive spreads quoted by market-makers for UK equity warrants. However,
there are two simple steps which may be taken to ameliorate the apparent
difficulties. First, find a good stockbroker with established relationships
in the market. Often it is possible to deal at a price inside the quoted
spread, which is frequently no more than a starting point for negotiation.
Second, restrict dealings to leading issues where quoted spreads are 2 to 3
per cent.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your interesting article on the possible privatisation of Britain's
Post Office ('Return to sender - cost unknown', December 10) was generally a
balanced and stimulating feature on this difficult issue.
I was particularly interested in the comment that the Post Office might be
in a better position to fulfil its obligation to maintain a national network
'if it were permitted to undertake banking transactions'.
I should point out, of course, that Girobank, as I am sure you are aware,
provides a wide range of banking services for personal and corporate
customers through the Post Office network.
Girobank has well over 1m personal account holders and handles more than
Pounds 55bn a year through its cash handling service for corporate
customers.
Perhaps you may recall that Girobank plc was privatised from the Post Office
in July 1990 and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Alliance &amp;
Leicester Building Society.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Protectionist wolf in sheep's clothing: The increasing use
of anti-dumping actions could undermine the benefits of successful trade
negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of tortuous negotiations, the prospect of a successful
completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks has raised hopes of
substantial gains in international commerce. But trade experts have become
increasingly concerned that anti-dumping actions could undermine the
benefits of an agreement.
Such concerns are based on fears that increasing use of anti-dumping actions
 -duties and fines against alleged sales of products at below-cost prices -
represents a creeping protectionism which is raising new barriers to trade.
At present, dumping is dealt with under a special code in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which calls for complainants to report
dumping actions, and deals with disputes arising when exporters challenge a
dumping duty. Countries which have been frequent victims of dumping actions,
such as Japan, have become increasingly anxious for international curbs on
what they regard as harassment by the EC and the US.
Evidence of the growing protectionism behind anti-dumping actions comes in a
forthcoming study by the World Bank. According to the report, average
tariffs in the entire US manufacturing sector would be 23 per cent today -
compared with a nominal level of 6 per cent - if they were adjusted to
account for the cost of dumping duties on imported steel, textiles and cars,
the industries most affected.
'We appear through dumping actions to have rolled back about half of the
gains of the 45-year Gatt process,' says Mr Michael Finger at the World
Bank. When the Gatt was set up in 1947, tariffs averaged between 40 and 50
per cent.
'Anti-dumping actions are Smoot-Hawley in slow motion,' a leading Washington
trade lawyer said last week, referring to the controversial protectionist
law passed in the US in 1930, which played a critical part in fomenting a
tit-for-tat trade war that took the world into the Great Depression.
The current fears result from a proliferation of anti-dumping measures.
The decision earlier this month by the US to impose punitive fines on steel
imports from the European Community, and the EC's own imposition of punitive
duties on eastern European steel exporters, are the latest incidents in an
accelerating trend. The number of anti-dumping actions in international
markets has risen from 96 in the year to June 1990 to 237 in the year to
this June.
The number of countries using the measures is also rising. Australia
overtook the US last year as the biggest user of anti-dumping actions, while
Mexico for the first time launched more actions than the EC. Developing
countries have now brought a total of 162 actions, all of them since 1985.
At the same time, the range of products affected by anti-dumping duties has
grown. In the EC alone products affected range from ethanol, cement and
aspirin to computers, fork-lift trucks and flowers.
Expansion of these measures is partly the result of the reduction in tariff
barriers. In the US and Europe, industries ranging from cars to electronics
have found it steadily harder to compete against foreign manufacturers as
tariff walls have fallen. Recession has exacerbated the effects of foreign
competition, fuelling calls for protection from imports. The previous
recession, of 1982-84, also prompted a rise in anti-dumping activity; the
costs of such action still weigh heavily on several industries, notably
chemicals.
Mr Michael Davenport, a former European Commission economist, believes
governments also use anti-dumping actions as a means of promoting certain
industries. 'Anti-dumping policy in the EC seems now to be used covertly as
industrial policy,' he says.
Supporters of anti-dumping actions from within industry and government argue
that the measures are necessary to prevent unfair market practices.
'Anti-dumping actions are a blunt instrument, and don't always follow the
markets. But in a global economy full of distortions, they are the only
recourse industry has,' argues Mr Sean Mackle of the Chemical Industries
Association.
But the ways in which governments determine what constitutes dumping
generally stack the cards against exporters and are open to abuse.
When the US Commerce Department investigates a charge of dumping, it uses an
arbitrary profit margin of 8 per cent to determine whether the price of the
exporter's products is 'fair'. This margin is set despite the fact that
profits before income taxes for all US companies average 6 per cent,
according to calculations by the International Trade Commission in the US.
In 1989, the Court of International Trade in the US complained that the
Department of Commerce's methods of comparing prices results in 'a loss of
reasonable fairness'. All but 5 per cent of the department's investigations
result in a finding of dumping - penalising more than 3,000 foreign
companies since 1980.
Controversial findings abound. China has been found guilty of dumping
manhole covers after a comparison with production prices in Belgium, Canada,
France and Japan unsurprisingly showed the Chinese products were cheaper.
Hong Kong, a transparent and highly competitive economy, without subsidies,
has been charged with dumping sweaters and photograph albums.
In 1989, electronics group Matsushita of Japan abandoned its defence against
claims it was dumping telephone systems in the US when officials demanded on
a Friday afternoon that it translate 3,000 pages of Japanese financial
documents into English for presentation to investigators by the following
Monday.
For exporters to Europe, EC actions may appear equally capricious, though
fewer than a quarter of investigations over the past decade have resulted in
duties being charged. Instead, the EC appears to prefer 'voluntary'
restraint agreements by exporters. More than half of all cases have led to
'special undertakings' under which importers agree to raise prices. Many of
the others are referred to as 'investigations which have been terminated for
other reasons'. This usually means that informal import restrictions were
agreed.
Nor is there any effort in Brussels or Washington to discover whether
'dumping' is helpful or damaging. As a recent IMF report complains, it is
often 'not low prices abroad, but high prices at home, that should be
objected to'.
US steel users have been quick to protest that the duties announced this
month, which range as high as 58 per cent, will raise their costs and damage
their competitiveness. Britain's National Consumer Council has calculated
that in consumer electronics alone, the cost to EC consumers of Community
anti-dumping measures is Pounds 1.17bn a year.
The draft Uruguay Round agreement is intended to spur anti-dumping reform,
but economists say the text is largely copied from existing US and EC law -
the text that provides a framework for abuse. Without further toughening of
anti-dumping law, any trade gains might prove illusory.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Letter: Japanese report sets example for Russian economic
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ARTHUR KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his Personal View (December 10) on the Russian economy, John
Odling-Smee makes no reference to measures of the kind proposed by Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry in a document delivered to
Moscow earlier this year ('Economic Notebook: A Japanese lesson for all',
July 20). These draw upon Japanese experiences in the post-1946 period to
make suggestions about economic reform in Russia.
The Miti document refers to an International Monetary Fund memorandum of
February 27 about measures the Russian government has to take by the end of
this year. It accepts those measures as necessary for macroeconomic
stabilisation (specifically mentioning as essential a move towards price
liberalisation 'which no other policy measure should be allowed to impede')
but doubts that those measures alone are enough to revitalise production. It
comments that the government thinks it can implement microeconomic
restructuing after there are signs of macroeconomic stability, but believes
that macroeconomic stabilisation will take about five years. It argues that
market mechanisms alone will not work; some government intervention is
inevitable; to diversify investment would be the worst policy; a focus is
needed on specific sectors. It proposes a 'Russian-type new priority
production system' with priority to the oil industry which would involve
price, quota and export tax arrangements.
Such arrangements, the document claims, could have beneficial effects on the
costs of other important industries, provide a significant source of foreign
currency for industrial modernisation, and impart a stabilising fiscal
influence.
The foregoing is a brief extract from advice which derives from the Japanese
experience in managing a successful economic performance. It would be
helpful to understanding the policy-making scene to know whether the
Russians are being encouraged to see the Japanese advice as a potentially
constructive contribution to their planning.

Sir, David Cannadine's gall-flavoured colonial view of our 'anachronistic
relic' (his words) of a monarchy ('The royal dilemma that won't go away',
December 12) may very well be grist to the mills of those of your readers
who suffer from some ill-defined nightmare of a monarchical 'democratic
deficit' in this country.
While it is indeed true that our politicians use the crown as a cloak for
their generally incompetent and nefarious doings, it is even more true that
the monarch protects us from the ultimate indignity of a politician as head
of state (given that we would hardly be so fortunate as to find another
Richard von Weizsacker here).
The monarchy also ensures that there is someone of commonsense and sanity to
take over in the event, hardly inconceivable these days, of the politicians
finally becoming so incompetent that they cannot keep the 'ship of state'
afloat any longer, bail as they might]

Armed with the correct postcode but not much else, the British Post Office

The signature inside was illegible but scrutiny of the envelope revealed
that it had come from the office of Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chief

its new Golf, but it has some way to go before it can qualify for

While not the worst of Russia's problems, the former Soviet embassy on
Berlin's Unter den Linden is proving more of an embarrassy to the
purse-pinched diplomats now headquartered in Bonn.
'Grandiose' does less than justice to the Berlin edifice, built in 1951 as
part of Germany's war reparations. It boasts an opulence of - among other
things - pillared chambers, a stairway of dark green marble taken from
Hitler's chancellery, and a stained glass panorama of the Kremlin. Paying
for its upkeep is another matter.
One idea the Russians have been working on is to use the immense dining hall
for 'market-oriented events'. But they have now had another inspiration.
It's to get the building listed as a Berlin landmark, so obliging the city
authorities to contribute to its maintenance.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the invasion of British journalists into the top positions in the US
magazine business about to be repeated in the cut-throat world of New York
tabloid newspapers?
If Mort Zuckerman, the US real estate developer turned publisher, can lick
the New York printing unions into letting him take over the New York Daily
News, one of his first jobs will be to recruit a Fleet Street editor.
Mort, owner of US News and World Report, has already been sounding out the
top brass at Associated Newspapers; the suggestion has been made that the
man to turn round the Daily News is Martin Dunn, the 37-year-old editor of
Today, part of Rupert Murdoch's rival stable.
Of course, this may be just a bit of mischief-making. But Dunn seems well
suited. Not only has he lifted Today's circulation by more than 20 per cent,
but he spent six years in the Big Apple partly working for the Sun. The word
is that he would be off like a shot if he were offered the chance to edit
the Daily News.

A Hungarian, it's said, is someone who enters a revolving door behind you

It is three years since GE acquired Tungsram, the former state-owned
Hungarian lightbulb-maker, thus inheriting Csapody who had been with the
company since starting work as an electrician. Following the takeover, the
westerners gave the instructions, he says.
But the positions have been reversed by the shake-up in GE Lighting Europe
aimed at integrating Tungsram with the lighting business bought from the
UK's Thorn EMI. Csapody has emerged from the revolving door ahead.
The self-assured 53-year-old, who learnt English by reading Oscar Wilde at
home, becomes responsible for research centres in Leicester and Enfield in
the UK, as well as in his native Hungary. His position is probably the
highest any native east European has risen within a western multinational.
A sheltered east European managerial upbringing can occasionally be a boon.
Csapody says he did not quake when he first met Jack Welch, GE's formidable
CEO . . .before admitting: 'I didn't know enough about him to be scared.'

FT  15 DEC 92 / Observer: Saab sucks it to 'em
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tossing modesty to the winds, Swedish car maker Saab is claiming that its
latest cars are so environmentally 'correct' that the exhaust gases going
out can be cleaner than the air going in.
It says that this result was achieved during tests conducted in the City of
London by the government's Warren Springs environmental research laboratory.
The electronic exhaust technology used in the latest Saab cars produced
fewer smog-causing nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons than was found in the
air monitored at the engine intake.
But before the green lobby starts gratefully to disband it should realise
that the war is by no means won. Saab is not to start marketing its new cars
as environmental vacuum cleaners, because, of course, all is not as
wonderful as it sounds.
Since fewer than a tenth of vehicles in the UK are fitted with catalytic
converters, the car in front of the Saab would more than likely have been
cheerfully belching the nasty stuff directly into the Swedish car's engine.
So, puffed with pride though Saab may be, it is still only converting the
very dirty to the merely dirty.

FT  15 DEC 92 / A profitable homecoming: FT writers examine the contribution
of Chinese entrepreneurs to the wave of investment in their ancestral
birthplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE, SIMON HOLBERTON, WILLIAM KEELING, VICTOR MALLET and
ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kitti Dumnernchanwanit, president of a Thai industrial conglomerate, last
month agreed on a Dollars 1bn forestry, pulp and paper project in China's
Guangdong province. The deal, part of the wave of foreign investment that
has swept into China recently, underlines the leading role that ethnic
Chinese from throughout south-east Asia are playing in the country's
economic boom.
'I am a Chinese, but was born in Thailand,' Mr Kitti says. 'I always realise
that for a human being it is a must to bring progress and prosperity to his
country of origin.'
From the launch of China's 'open door' reforms in 1979 until the end of last
year, Dollars 56bn of foreign investment has poured into the country;
Dollars 12bn was invested in 1991 alone, nearly double the amount of each of
the previous three years, according to official Chinese figures. The
acceleration is likely to have continued this year as a result of a new push
by Beijing for growth.
Determining the origin of investments is difficult because most of it is
done through companies in Hong Kong. A large part is coming from Hong Kong
Chinese and Taiwanese investors - communities that naturally regard China as
their homeland. But significant amounts are also coming from the rapidly
growing economies of south-east Asia.
Though its scale is difficult to quantify, there are plenty of investment
examples. Indonesia's Salim group, run by Mr Liem Sioe Liong, is involved in
many projects in China, including water treatment and power plants to supply
industrial estates and towns. Lippo group, another Indonesian conglomerate,
has investment proposals through its Hong Kong arm totalling Dollars 1bn,
including a deep water port in Fujian province.
Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, founded by the ethnic Chinese
Sophonpanich family, has opened a branch in Shantou which will process
inward remittances from ethnic Chinese in south-east Asia. Investments of
the Charoen Pokphand group, the biggest Thai investor in China, include
animal feed mills, chicken farms, a motorcycle factory and a brewery.
Mr Robert Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese tycoon, is a partner in the Beijing
World Trade Centre, an office, conference and hotel complex which is the
country's largest commercial property project. His Shangri-La hotels are in
several Chinese cities, and he is investing in other projects, including one
in his ancestral city of Fuzhou in the south.
For the ethnic Chinese in south-east Asia, there are cultural as well as
business reasons for investing in their homeland. Many have only loose
connections with China, their forebears having migrated generations ago.
However, emotional attachments are strong and knowledge of Chinese dialects
remains widespread. 'For us to move to China is quite easy because of the
language, and we all have the Chinese mentality,' says Mr Prasong
Panichpakdee, managing director of Thailand's Somprasong Land Development,
which is building condominiums in China.
Throughout south-east Asia, ethnic Chinese are the main entrepreneurs and
dominate business activity in most countries. Their investment is vital for
continuing growth. Consequently, a significant diversion of funds to China
could have economic and political repercussions in the region.
A Singapore-based investment analyst says: 'The governments in this region
have not yet woken up to the volume of investment now going to China - it
could mean precious investment funds draining away from the region. That
would only cause more anti-Chinese resentment, especially in Indonesia and
Malaysia.' Indeed, many overseas Chinese feel discriminated against in their
home countries, despite their economic power. In Malaysia, where they make
up about 30 per cent of the population, they face officially sanctioned
discrimination in areas ranging from allocation of equity issues to quotas
on educational opportunities.
Since 1971, partly in response to anti-Chinese riots and concern about
Chinese control of the economy, the policy of the Malay-dominated government
has emphasised discrimination in favour of Malays. The aim was to increase
their participation in the economy and prevent racial conflict. According to
official figures, Malays now control more than 20 per cent of corporate
equity. Though race relations have mostly been calm, Malays still resent the
economic power of the Chinese, who dislike being treated as second-class
citizens.
In Singapore, where most people are ethnic Chinese, the government has
reversed policy and is now encouraging investment in China. Singapore's
economy, along with the economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea, has
reached the stage where it is targeting high-technology industry for
domestic growth, with lower-level manufacturing being farmed out to cheap
labour countries such as China and Vietnam.
In Thailand, where the overwhelming majority of companies large enough to
contemplate foreign investment are controlled by ethnic Chinese families,
the wave of investment in China is not controversial. There is enough
capital available for investment in Thailand, and no one has publicly
expressed fears that investment into China will hinder development.
The situation in Indonesia, however, is more delicate. The Chinese community
makes up about 4 per cent of the 183m population and dominates the economy.
Ethnic Chinese control most conglomerates and large private banks.
Diplomats say that Indonesia is quietly putting pressure on its Chinese
community not to take money abroad. Many businessmen believe it is fighting
an uphill battle. A non-Chinese executive of Bimantara Group, a conglomerate
headed by a son of President Suharto, says: 'I think the Chinese are tired
(of Indonesia). They will keep their investments here, but profits will go
to China. The Chinese are going back to China.'
Mr Adrianus Mooy, governor of the central bank, says: 'It's not expected of
them to be short-sighted and only to look at the opportunities in
Indonesia.' Low wages and a large internal market, he says, will allow
Indonesia to remain competitive with southern China.
Ethnic Chinese businessmen in Indonesia insist that investments in China are
made on the basis of financial pragmatism rather than emotion. China, they
say, simply offers better returns than elsewhere. Mr Sofjan Wanandi,
chairman of Gemala Group, says conglomerates need to diversify. 'They are
big already in Indonesia and want to broaden their base.' He says finance
for expansion into China is coming mostly from outside Indonesia because of
local high lending rates.
'There is growth available for everybody,' says Mr Gus Nilo, managing
director of Sinar Mas, an Indonesian conglomerate with substantial
investments in China. 'It's a question of what industry will grow in what
country.'
The profit motive is clearly the primary force driving south-east Asia's
Chinese back to China. The homeland offers a huge market with low land and
labour costs, with the prospect of fast growth in domestic sales and
exports. Many businessmen return to their ancestral villages because they
have connections with local people. Family connections help - relatives may
know local government and Communist party officials, and may be officials
themselves. Good contacts mean good business.
Business, however, may not be the only motive. Mr Wang Sui-lin, professor of
sociology at Hong Kong University, says: 'They are returning home in an
ultimate sense. Among the overseas Chinese there is a strong sense of
ancestral roots. They want the status that comes with the recognition
conferred on them by their birthplace, or the birthplace of their
ancestors.'

FT  15 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Departure of a reformer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THEIR Edinburgh summit, the European Community's heads of government
announced 'strong support' for Mr Boris Yeltsin's attempt to bring economic
reform to Russia. The Congress of People's Deputies does not share the
west's enthusiasm. But that enthusiasm was rhetorical. If the opportunity to
bring about comprehensive reform has disappeared, the west bears a
substantial part of the blame.
Mr Gaidar's loss is a serious, perhaps terminal, blow for Mr Yeltsin's
reforms. The new prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, is an apparatchik
brought into the government when Mr Yeltsin was trying to broaden support
earlier this year. As gas minister under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr
Chernomyrdin is associated with the failures of the last Soviet regime.
Nothing suggests he understands how to transform Russia into a working, let
alone a successful, market economy.
Nonetheless, this black cloud has a silver lining. Mr Gaidar's dilemma has
been how long to remain in a government that was being diverted ever further
from reform. The advantage of staying was his influence upon policy. The
disadvantage was the way reform was being blamed for its opposite. Printing
bushels of money in aid of the old industrial dinosaurs is not reform. It is
just another version of the ancien regime.
Mr Gaidar's dilemma has been resolved, but not Mr Yeltsin's. He must now
decide whether to oppose this government. Instead of being associated with
its blunders, he could blame the unpalatable results upon the conservative
elements that have foisted it upon him. Any distance he can put between
himself and what is likely to become an increasingly unpopular government
should also strengthen his campaign for constitutional reform.
This would be a risky path for Mr Yeltsin. With luck it will be unnecessary.
Maybe Mr Chernomyrdin and his colleagues will recognise - as has Mr Leonid
Kuchma in Ukraine - that radical reform is the only alternative. If so, Mr
Yeltsin could support the government with a good conscience. Hitherto, Mr
Gaidar has been the standard-bearer for reform. If his policies come to be
seen as the logical response to circumstances rather than as personal whims,
then the legitimacy of reform might itself grow.
Nevertheless, Mr Gaidar's departure does mark the end of the first attempt
at transformation of the Russian economy. For the inability of Mr Yeltsin to
carry through coherent reform, the west bears some responsibility. In
Russia's distorted economy, any reform was bound to create a legion of
powerful losers. A part of the solution was political reform. The other part
was greater foreign assistance. As Professor Jeffrey Sachs, a senior adviser
to the government, has argued, the lack of such assistance 'has made Boris
Yeltsin's task vastly more arduous and strengthened the hands of the
hardliners'.
The west has watched Russia's first serious reform government drown. Should
the opportunity recur, it must not fail again.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Health reforms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK National Health Service appears to be returning to old ways 18 months
after the government launched its far-reaching health service reforms. Ward
closures and lengthening waiting lists for operations are again threatened
as hospitals run out of money before the end of the financial year. It
appears that little has changed since 1987 when a similar crisis led the
government to create an internal market in the NHS.
In one sense, this is hardly surprising: an important cause of the 1987 NHS
crisis was the shortage of funds, a condition the reforms did nothing to
cure. Instead, the internal market converted district health authorities
into purchasers of health care, free to shop around among competing
providers such as hospitals and community health organisations. The aim was
to ensure that the available funds would be spent more efficiently. But the
internal market did not, of itself, generate new funds.
In practice, generous funding was agreed in successive years, to ease the
passage of the politically controversial changes. Ministers warmly welcomed
the improvements in health care which followed and credited them to the
reforms. Now, with much less generous settlements for the next three years,
they must face the down side of the internal market.
The first is that a real market system must produce losers as well as
winners, as those who are less efficient go to the wall. In London, the
losers are likely to be the world-famous hospitals recommended for closure
or merger in the Tomlinson report. With doubts over the figures behind some
of Tomlinson's recommendations, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, will need skill and resolution to eliminate excess capacity in
London.
A second problem is that while providers now vie for business, the district
health authorities which act as purchasers on behalf of most people are
largely immune to market forces. The only competition comes from a minority
of family doctors who are fund-holders, directly purchasing health care for
their patients in the internal market. They have been a dynamic force,
producing significant efficiency savings while improving the quality of care
for their patients. Fund-holding should be extended, with smaller practices
grouped to make viable purchasing units.
Finally, there are few incentives to reward providers whose efficiency in
treating patients leads them to fulfil their contracts and so run out of
work before the end of the year. Where it can be demonstrated that greater
efficiency rather than the quality and cost of their services has led to
such problems, additional funds should be made available. That will be
difficult next year when the real growth in the health service budget is
unlikely to be more than 1 per cent. The government will remain under
pressure to lubricate with more cash the incomplete process of creating a
working market in health care.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Need for friendly giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years of buttering up Chancellor Helmut Kohl paid dividends for Mr John
Major at the weekend. Now he must labour mightily, and perhaps for as long,
to achieve a good personal rapport with Mr Bill Clinton. The prime minister
is surely aware of this. His aim must be to establish as profitable a
working relationship with Washington as the one he has with Bonn. A
medium-sized nation such as Britain needs the friendship of both giants, one
for its economic influence within Europe, the other because it is the only
superpower.
Mr Major worked hard for success at the European summit in Edinburgh. His
well-known negotiating skills were effectively deployed. His attention to
detail and his mastery of a complicated brief have been rightly praised. Yet
without German support all that effort might have been in vain. One day - no
one can tell when - the prime minister will need US understanding as badly
as he required that of Germany on Friday and Saturday.
Until now it has usually been possible to count on an amicable President
George Bush. That helped Number 10 Downing Street play an important part in
salvaging the Gatt negotiations just a few weeks ago. Mr Major spoke as
president of the European Council, but his voice was that of a dependable
ally. When former President Ronald Reagan and Lady Thatcher were both in
office, the link was telepathic. When Mr Major wishes to talk to Mr Bush,
the Oval Room, like Mr Kohl's office, is only a telephone call away. The
arrival in the White House next month of a completely new man - a favourite
of the 1960s generation and a Democrat - puts a question mark over all that.
Washington can no longer be taken for granted. Mr Major must earn Mr
Clinton's trust.
The courtship will not be easy, or quick. It starts with an embarrassed
shuffling of feet as memories of the role played by the Conservative party
in Mr Bush's campaign (and Labour in Mr Clinton's) are allowed to fade. This
is good dirty fun, but it is not the essence of the matter. Mr Clinton
sought out Sir Robin Renwick, the British ambassador, at a glittering party
thrown by Mrs Kay Graham in Washington last week. Perhaps this was a pay-off
for half a year of persistent, and characteristic, precautionary burrowing
into the Democratic camp undertaken by the ambassador and his staff. The
president-elect assured Sir Robin that no insult was intended by his
inability to find time to see Mr Major when he visits the US later this
week.
Surely not, but Mr Clinton's diary is a reminder that his priority is
management of the domestic economy. A page on which to write the word
'Britain' has not yet been found. Mr Major's priority is his policy for
western Europe. I trust that, for him, the word 'America' is on page one of
1993.
The shift of emphasis in both Washington and London away from the
transatlantic link makes the re-establishment of a strong relationship
difficult. This loosening of ties was bound to happen. The cold war is over.
Before the Berlin Wall came down, western diplomats and military planners
could tell themselves that they were all working within the same global
framework. That sense of grand strategy has gone. Officials around Lady
Thatcher and President Reagan could hum the same tunes because they thought
alike. There is no such natural harmony today. There will be even less after
January 20, when the new president takes over.
Some old hands argue that Mr Clinton will soon see the need for a practical
alliance with Britain. The United Kingdom is a nuclear power, a permanent
member of the Security Council, a potentially useful provider of military
bases, a brother in the intelligence family. New international crises will
present themselves. Russian policy cannot be foretold. President Saddam
Hussein is still in control of Iraq. The politics of trade negotiations is
continuous. The war in former Yugoslavia is exploding right now.
The new president will have to decide how to handle such matters - when he
eventually gets around to foreign policy. His natural instinct may be to
deal with western Europe as a region and the EC as its local organisation.
Against that must be set growing US irritation at the Europeans' failure to
respond to the needs of Bosnia. I would also be irritated, were I an
American, by the knee-jerk anti-Yankee response to the intervention in
Somalia. President Bush's motives may be impure, but tell that to a starving
child.
What Mr Major has to do first is ascertain just how responsive to calls the
new Uncle Sam is going to be. Europeans in general, and the French in
particular, like to proclaim the EC as an alternative superpower, but go
running to the real one whenever serious money, or action, is called for.
British Conservatives do not, by and large, fall into this trap. They know
where the centre of military power lies, and seek to work with it. This
ancient process may not be so simple with Mr Clinton in the White House.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOWHERE IN the world is the language of political violence more direct and
expressive than in the Middle East. By kidnapping an Israeli border guard in
Israel at the weekend and proposing a prisoner exchange, the militantly
Islamic Palestinian group Hamas is engaged in more than a forceful effort to
secure the release of its jailed leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. It is
attempting, at a moment of apparent stagnation in Middle East peace talks,
to undermine the negotiating process and assert itself as the leading
Palestinian force confronting Israel.
It will not succeed, at least in the short term. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's
newly elected prime minister, remains committed to the peace process and
says he believes it will yield agreement with at least some of his Arab
neighbours next year. The Palestinians, too, are still uncomfortably on
board.
Nevertheless, the latest incident is a disturbing sign of the times. Coming
after a week in which Hamas has murdered five Israeli soldiers, it
underlines how the Islamic fundamentalists are coming to the fore, and are
changing the character of the intifada, the five-year-old Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In Gaza
especially, where the rebellion began and where Hamas's strength is
concentrated, the conflict seems to be shifting from sticks and stones to
low-level guerrilla warfare.
Hamas's activities would not be so worrying if it were not for the fact that
they are taking place in something of a political vacuum. The US-sponsored
peace process launched in Madrid more than a year ago has yet to show
tangible progress. In particular the Palestinian negotiators are showing
increasing frustration with what they have thus far been offered: an
interim, strictly limited arrangement for self-rule in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip pending talks on a final settlement after three
years.
It makes for a political climate in the territories in which violence could
easily obtain a momentum of its own, and lead to a further hardening of
attitudes on both sides. Mr Rabin will need to show diplomatic skill as well
as toughness if the kidnapping affair is not to escalate.
Most important, however, is the need to inject fresh momentum into the
Washington negotiations. Israel, whose initial proposals on Palestinian
autonomy were unacceptably meagre, must be urged to improve its offer. The
Palestinians must then be pressed to proceed with local elections, and
convinced that they cannot expect to exact further concessions through
violence or external pressure. The other Arab negotiating parties must be
kept at the table.
There is only one player that can do all these things: the country that
launched the process. Add the Middle East to the list of foreign problems
that will confront President-elect Bill Clinton immediately after
inauguration day.

<TEXT>
Indonesian businessman Mr Liem Sioe Liong, one of the wealthiest overseas
Chinese in south-east Asia, is at the centre of the latest big investment to
be announced in China. The deal illustrates Mr Liem's return to ancestral
roots, a common motivation among overseas Chinese investing in their
homeland, writes Kieran Cooke.
He has teamed up with two state-controlled Singaporean companies to develop
an industrial park in China's Fujian province. The first phase will cost
Dollars 185m.
Mr Liem heads the Salim group, which has an estimated annual turnover of
Dollars 8bn and is Indonesia's biggest business group. The group is involved
in cement, steelmaking, shipping, property, flour milling, noodle making and
other activities.
Mr Liem is a native of Fujian and has maintained close links with the
province. Singapore itself has close connections with Fujian province, home
of people who speak the Hokkien Chinese dialect, which is widely spoken in
Singapore.
A Singapore-based investment analyst says Mr Liem's project is an example of
'the Singapore Inc approach - cash-rich government companies linking up with
well-connected private interests to exploit an opportunity'.
Mr Liem will hold a 40 per cent share in a company which will plan and
manage the Fujian enterprise. Other companies connected with Mr Liem will
have an additional 30 per cent stake, while the two Singaporean companies,
Singapore Technologies and Jurong Environmental Engineering, will each have
a 10 per cent share.
The project involves turning a 5,000-hectare area into a commercial,
industrial and residential complex. Port and other infrastructure facilities
will also be built. The aim is to attract light and medium-sized industries
from Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan.
The complex is designed to be a low-cost export manufacturing base which
will act as a springboard for further trade and investments in China. It is
close to Taiwan, which is also investing heavily in Fujian.
But the project could cause regional ripples. 'There are many people in
Indonesia who feel that Liem, having made his money there, should not be
investing big amounts in China. Allowing our (Singapore) state companies to
get involved in such high-profile projects could cause problems in our
future relations with Indonesia,' says a Singapore-based analyst.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Arts: Pictures worth picking up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Autolycus, 'picker-up of unconsidered trifles', we know as the rogue and
pedlar of The Winter's Tale, which brings me to a seasonal swag-bagful, not
of trifles exactly, but of current offerings that otherwise might well pass
unnoticed and well worth picking-up.
Glen Baxter is that not uncommon type, the naturally funny man who would be
taken seriously, the fool or Jaques, mordant, ironical, but funny
nonetheless. Fortunately for us, he has abandoned previous attempts at overt
seriousness, and reverted to being as funny as ever with his surreal
confection of schoolboy-schoolgirl heroics, camp cowboys and art-aesthetical
jokes, and all worked up in idiosyncratic pastiche of the juvenile
illustration of the 1930s. It is for us to work out whether the results are
art or not.
But what else are we to make of these 'Further Blandishments', as he calls
them? A 'Big Bertha' cannon looms over the landscape: 'He was known not to
take kindly to trespassers' runs the caption. A cowboy comes galloping down
the Long Gallery, along with the information that 'Hank's tour of the Louvre
was usually completed in slightly under 18 minutes.' 'The night before the
big match, Billy liked to put in a little extra practice,' by kicking anvils
into goal. Quite where all this will lead him, who can say, but as
conceptual art, Baxter's special variety certainly has popular appeal.
It is a recurrent theme that our London view of Scottish painting is
arbitrary and limited, but it must also be said that the Mercury Gallery has
always done its best to repair the deficiency. David Michie, a long-time
regular, now reappears after six years with as strong a show as any he has
had. Until lately head of painting at the Edinburgh College of Art, he must
have seen too many younger, lesser Scottish talents pass on to wider success
and recognition, but I doubt that worries him too much. His subject,
meanwhile, remains the intimate landscape of garden border and flower-bed,
and the more introspective, enclosed world of the garden pond, with its
darting ornamental fish, glancing surfaces and ambiguously redoubled spaces.
These he paints with a deceptive fauvist directness and simplicity, and a
Matisse-like purity of colour. Yet there is nothing brash nor 'see here'
about them, but rather a quiet modesty and self-effacement that slowly draws
the viewer to them. They are as good as anything being done of their kind.
David Parfitt's present subject is the landscape of Crete and Macedonia,
worked on paper, sometimes in oil but mostly in water-colour. There is no
greater absurdity in art than the conventional hierarchy of the media that
puts oil before water-colour and canvas before paper. It is what the artist
does with his chosen and appropriate medium that matters, and here Parfitt
shows us large and truly substantial paintings, that are as they are because
they are in water-colour.
The handful of oil paintings confirm the point, not by any qualitative
distinction but by the simple fact of technical difference - neither better
nor worse, but different. Where the one sort is light and shimmering on the
surface, the other is dense and opaque, the mood now fresh, now heavier.
Parfitt has a particular gift for the description of architecture, not as an
exercise in close inspection, but generally and collectively: the cluster of
houses set among the trees, the village street at a distance in the sun-lit
valley below.
Terry Lee is another painter of landscape, and also of the studio interior
and still-life. Here I must declare my interest, for this show came of my
suggestion and my support is therefore implicit. He, too, is seen too seldom
in London. He is a romantic, idealising the landscape, whether at home in
Derbyshire or in Spain. All is apparently straight-forward: flower in pot,
bird in cage, artist in studio, landscape at a distance, all properly
established in its particular space; yet all is subtle and complex. The
spaces shift and alter; the curtains become landscape; the mirror leads into
another world.
Stan Smith and Geoffrey Humphries, showing together, afford a strong but
sympathetic contrast. Both work from the life-model, but where Humphries
stays close to the character and form of the particular model, Smith is more
apt to generalise, the light filtering through the blinds to fall in
descriptive stripes across the figure. Humphries also shows a number of
studies of Venice, not the hackneyed tourist views, but rather the more
personal and intimate face of the city in which he has lived and worked for
nearly 30 years.
A group of his larger life drawings is featured in the mixed exhibition at
Collyer-Bristow, in which Smith also shows. And there is WH Patterson's
annual Christmas Show, which, like any such exercise, would hardly hope to
satisfy every taste, leaving it very much to the visitor to take his pick.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Arts: Troubled 'Don Carlo' at La Scala - Opera in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though the performance of Verdi's Don Carlo (the Italian, 4-act version)
that opened the season of La Scala was not televised, Luciano Pavarotti's
cracked note in the second scene hit all the news broadcasts and kindled an
inflagration of gossip, angry declarations, and, from the tenor himself, an
apology and an admission that he had insufficiently prepared for this new
role.
He also promised that there would be no botched notes on the second night.
He kept his promise; but he still did not seem in command of the character.
He was simply a tenor going through his paces competently, with little
feeling or psychological understanding.
'Pavarotti protagonista', the headlines yelled in the preliminary articles
puffing the production; but though Carlo has the title role, he is not the
protagonist. This is a grand opera whose drama is chiefly private; the
excitement lies not in spectacular events so much as in the personal
tensions, the alternation of suspicion and trust, condemnation and
forgiveness, ardour and renunciation.
Few of these inner conflicts were revealed in the Scala execution, but the
fault was not entirely Pavarotti's. As the dreaded 'loggionisti,' the
bellowing galleryites emphasised in their raucous opening-night protests,
the casting was peculiar: if Pavarotti is no Carlos, then the otherwise
charming Daniela Dess is a perilously light Elisabetta, and Luciana D'Intino
is more a Rossinian mezzo than a Verdian (her 'veil song,' however, had a
welcome lightness and a gaiety absent in Riccardo Muti's hectic conducting
of the scene).
A few years ago, in a Bologna Don Carlo, the young baritone Paolo Coni was a
revelation as Rodrigo; critics immediately underlined his name in their
programmes. Since then, Coni has appeared on both sides of the Atlantic, but
sadly, in this short period, the warm, lyric voice has deteriorated: the top
notes have become rough and unsteady, pitch is often uncertain, and Coni
tends now to bluster.
Only Samuel Ramey - La Scala's Filippo - sang with confidence, accuracy and
a sense of his part. It is hard to find the youthful, athletic American bass
credible as an aged monarch; Ramey was an unusually physical Filippo, and
when he grasped Elisabetta in their great confrontation, there was a strong
sense of sexual frustration in his rage. This was not an interpretation in
the Pasero, Rossi Lemeni, Christoff tradition, but it was a
three-dimensional creation. And Ramey's was the only really compelling
performance.
Blame for the inadequacy of so many of the singers was laid squarely at
Muti's door, but the conductor had an even graver responsibility. Unlike his
usual triumphs, at La Scala and elsewhere, Muti's Don Carlo lacked an
over-all architecture. Needless to say, there were brilliant scenes (the
auto-da-fe' especially) and there were moments of heart-rending emotion (the
death of Rodrigo); but much of the time the performance was a patchwork: the
fountain scene opened dully, the final tenor-soprano duet was drawn out
until it sagged and became shapeless.
Franco Zeffirelli's production, while cluttered and bustling, was also
lacklustre. Even the crowd scenes were perfunctory: extras only
half-pretended to be an unruly mob of onlookers were intermittently held
back by guards in a cordon with gaps wide enough for an army to pass
through; a pair of breech-clouted heretics struck choreographed poses, a
cramped procession preceded the king's oddly tame coronation appearance (no
solemn throwing open of doors, since the producer eliminated the doors, as
he eliminated later the tomb of Charles V).
The solo singers were also left to their own devices (comically, the Grand
Inquisitor, despite his elaborate show of blindness, managed to descend some
steps, unaided, and address much of his music straight at the audience from
the footlights). Pavarotti's immobility obviously creates its own set of
problems; keeping the other singers usually at a distance from him only
underlines the lack of dramatic cohesion in the whole, undistinguished
execution.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Arts: Key political dramas on the post-war stage - German
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The warnings are strident, unmistakeable, and up-to-date. Everyone has his
price, and anyone, by refusing to face the truth, can let an evil regime
like Hitler's spring up under his nose. For nearly 40 years, Frederich
Durrenmatt's The Visit (1956) and Max Frisch's The Fireraiser (1958), have
reigned unchallenged as the key political dramas on Germany's post-war
stage. Now, in the country's greatest turmoil since the war, they have
acquired a new, mythic currency, and are among the most popular modern works
in the repertory. Both are short, devastatingly simple parable plays which
bowl you over the first time but hold no later subtleties. I caught two new
versions, in Dusseldorf and Berlin, which stand as the best of straight,
hard-hitting theatre: strong acting, hypnotically intense setting, comic
diversity.
In The Fireraiser ('Biedermann und die Brandstifter'), two terrorists
infiltrate the home of rich business-man Biedermann and stack petrol in the
roof to blow him up. Biedermann ('honest man') pretends not to see what is
happening and relies on good-natured civility to keep menace at bay. He
invites the fireraisers to dinner, offers nervous friendship, and at last
hands them the matches to light the fire.
On a tiny stage in Dusseldorf, Peter Arens plays it as theatre of the absurd
with a heart. Eckart Dux's Biedermann, floppy grey hair, cardigan and specs,
is par excellence the bourgeois liberal secure at home. 'I'm a free man, I
can think what I want,' he explodes to a suspicious fireman as petrol cans,
wires, fuses, proliferate round his gemutlich house.
The fireraisers, Ulrich von Bock a smooth entrepreneur, Claus Stahnke a
skinhead in punk gear, are 1990s types who could fit into any race riot
recently on German television screens. They are a comic duo - one gives a
Nazi salute, the other slaps him down with an apologetic laugh. The ease
with which these boors play at civilised living - admiring the Beaujolais
while gulping mustard neat from the jar - threatens the core of Biedermann's
cosy worldview.
Dux and his wife (Margrit Ensinger), a loving but weak couple, tread with
comic genius the line between paranoia and a self-deceiving attempt at
normality. When the fireraisers put on a post-prandial performance of
Everyman she reassures herself by recalling the Salzburg Festival. Then they
stand clasped, knowing their doom, as the chorus 'Everyman' changes to
'Biedermann'. For all the absurdity, a lyric finale, recited by a fireman
while giant statues of fireman glow all round the auditorium, is almost
unbearably moving.
In The Visit ('Der Besuch der alten Dames'), the shopkeeper Herr Ill is
Everyman. To his little town of Gullen, a poverty-stricken place with a
railway station in central Europe, returns his former lover, now a rich old
lady. Years back, he got her pregnant and rejected her. Now she offers his
fellow citizens a thousand million marks for their town as the price of his
head.
We, and Ill, know that he will die, and in Berlin Ekkehard Schall gives a
performance at once passionate and measured. His Ill, first a frightened
wretch who trembles, paces up and down his shop in frenzy shouting, by the
end acquires dignity as a tragic hero, resigned and low-spoken. As the
creepy old lady, Anneliese Romer becomes less and less dignified, although
she too has her moment of poignancy. She tells her roving lover that she has
a tomb ready for him at her palace in Capri: 'There you will stay. With me.'
The Schiller Theatre shoots the fable through with psychological interest,
but mostly, with its flair for dramatic design, goes for symbolic staging.
Romer is now in a black robe, harbinger of death, now in a white gown,
eternal bride. As she endows the town, the grey-green pallor of a bleak set
yields to richer colours. Alfred Kirchner directs at a fierce pace, and
throughout the contemporary resonance sounds: is the new united Germany
selling ethics for material security? Two evenings as compelling as any in
the theatre this year. And if art reflects life, this piece and The
Fireraisers show a Germany obsessed with itself, its history and its moral
and political future.

Compared to Paris in the great pre-war days of Joyce, Hemingway and Picasso,
the post war years were pretty lacklustre. Moreover, as time goes by the
stature of the pre-war crowd continues to grow while that of the post-war
group (Sartre, Camus, de Beauvoir, Genet) begins to shrink. Nevertheless, it
is the period starting in 1945 to which Melvyn Bragg turns his attention in
Channel 4's art and culture series, Without Walls (9.00). With luck Prime
Suspect 2 will contain the slick production skills and excellent acting of
the original (Helen Mirren stars again as the high ranking police detective)
without the tedious feminist propaganda. This time (9.00 then 10.40,
concluding tomorrow, ITV) the script has been written by Allan Cubitt.
Murder is the topic once more, with the body of a young girl found in an
Afro-Caribbean neighbourhood. In Troubleshooter 2 (9.50 BBC2), Sir John
Harvey-Jones visits one of the first hospital groups to be granted NHS Trust
status and remarks: 'No one in their right mind would build the hospitals
you've got and no one in their right mind would leave a hospital half
complete'.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Arts: New York Philharmonic 150th anniversary concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The New York Philharmonic - the oldest orchestra in the western hemisphere -
made its first noise on December 7 1842 when the gloriously named Ureli
Corelli Hill raised his baton over a group of largely German immigrants to
launch them into Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
Right through this season the Philharmonic is remembering its
sesquicentenary, notably with a stream of first performances that has
already brought us Messiaen's final pictures of paradise, 'Eclairs sur
l'au-dela. . .' But on the anniversary itself we were invited to celebrate
the recent past and the present rather than to glimpse the future.
In a hall swagged with gauze and tinsel, all three of the orchestra's
surviving music directors were on the podium - in turn, to be sure - to
conduct what was necessarily an oddly mixed concert, and one that could not
quite hit the note of festivity determinedly expected of it.
The best playing came at the start, in an addition to the scheduled
programme, when the orchestra, unconducted, turned back with high pride to
remember a fourth of its chiefs: Leonard Bernstein. His Candide overture
went with supreme panache, and if the speed was not quite his dizzying own,
the performance was an astonishing feat of ensemble playing, as well as a
revel of opera bouffe fizz, fanfare and, in the answering strains of the
middle section, expressive ardour in a Jewish mode.
The obvious conclusion was that this orchestra barely needs a conductor. The
second conclusion was that Bernstein remains, more than 20 years after he
relinquished the part, a tough act to follow. Never mind that Zubin Mehta
was - as we were reminded by the chairman, Stephen Stamas - music director
for a longer period, having charge of the orchestra from the end of the
Boulez regime (1971-7) until the arrival of Kurt Masur last year.
Bernstein's association with the Philharmonic covered a full
quarter-century, and his legacy - of recordings, of programming policy, of
memories - is still potent.
In contrast, it is as if the Boulez years had never been. All his
innovations - the commitment to music as intellectual adventure, the
'Prospective Encounters' that took the orchestra downtown to play Steve
Reich, the 'rug concerts' that imitated the informality of the Proms - were
abandoned under his successor, and a sense of missed opportunity underlay
his performance of La mer on this occasion. In its own way it was a rather
remarkable turning over of the piece's grim inheritances: a low-string
ostinato in the first movement, for instance, remembered Nibelheim. And the
lack of buoyancy in the middle movement was astonishing, given Boulez's
admiration, often voiced in word and as in deed, for its allusive
continuity.
The Boulez moment of dimmed glory was preceded by Mehta's display of
showmanship in Till Eulenspiegel (a nice touch to tuck his hands quickly
behind his back so that the players were left to give the last downbeat on
their own), and followed by Masur in the 'New World' Symphony, one of the
oldest jewels in the Philharmonic's crown of commissions. No doubt they have
played it better at other times (straitened violin sound in the upper
register remains a problem, especially in Masur performances), but surely
never more forcefully.
Masur's efforts to drive the first movement into sounding like a proper
Germanic sonata allegro, with a strenuous first subject and a momentous
development, made it seem that Dvorak was falling short in something he
never attempted. Everybody got on much better when the energy was less
fierce, in the slow movement and, most beautiful of all, the trio of the
scherzo, where Masur showed what delicious effects he and his wind players
can produce. There at least were the seeds of hope.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Technology: Ups and downs of downsizing - Emotions are
running high as the computer industry debates whether to phase out expensive
mainframes in favour of less cumbersome units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone in the computer business seeking a quiet life would be well advised
to avoid the complex topic of downsizing - the practice of replacing
expensive mainframe computer systems with networks of smaller, cheaper
computers. It can provoke strong emotions.
One of its strongest advocates is William Connor, director of information
technology for the general systems sector of Motorola, the US electronics
company.
Connor and other proponents of downsizing usually point to two main goals.
The first is to achieve a new responsiveness to business needs.
Much business software is delivered too late to take advantage of market
opportunities.
The second is to cut costs. A study by Hoskyns, the UK-based computing
services company, indicates that most organisations downsize for cost
reasons, although claim to be seeking enhanced performance. Cost containment
is, according to a Price Waterhouse survey, still top of a data processing
manager's priority list.
Motorola moved its applications from IBM mainframes to its own make of
distributed, multiuser Unix-based microcomputers. According to Connor, the
purchase of packaged application software suited to Unix and the use of
computer-based development tools cuts software development times by two
thirds.
All his computing and telecommunications costs amount to 1.4 per cent of
revenues, compared with more than 3 per cent for similar companies: 'We are
running at less than half the average of these companies. That translates to
a saving of more than Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) a year. That is Dollars 40m
of cost avoidance which can finance further reduction of selling prices,
increased research and development and profitability to the corporation.'
Motorola wants to eliminate all mainframe processing. With improved system
administration and network management, Connor believes the cost of
management information systems can be reduced to less than 1 per cent of
sales by the end of 1993.
Motorola seems to demonstrate convincing proof of the efficacy of
downsizing. The logic in its favour is impressive. Mainframe computers are
undoubtedly expensive. By one, albeit imperfect, measure of performance -
millions of instructions per second (mips) - they are vastly more expensive
than workstations or personal computers. A larger mainframe costs about
Pounds 50,000 for a large mainframe compared with less than Pounds 500 per
mips for a personal computer.
Mainframes also have to be housed in a data centre and fed electricity and
chilled water, not to mention expensive operating and applications software.
On this page last month, however, Peter Slavid, corporate systems manager
for ICL, expressed a somewhat iconoclastic view when he said that by 2000
there would be a strong trend towards upsizing - using a central mainframe
to process data held on a central database.
'Any downsized organisation looking for cost-effective solutions will
undoubtedly have to extract data from expensive personal computer and Unix
systems and dump it onto a parallel database server where it can be managed
efficiently and cheaply. I would challenge anyone to dispute this point,' he
wrote.
Slavid, whose job it is to sell mainframes, obviously has a commercial axe
to grind. The fact remains, however, that the jury appears still to be out
on the cost savings from downsizing. The Hoskyns study - involving more than
270 interviews with executives with responsibility for information
technology - concluded: 'Despite the general perception that downsizing is
the path to cost effective IT, more than one-third of respondents were
unable to quantify the cost savings associated with migration and
conversions. For those that could quantify costs, some saved millions of
pounds while others had actually incurred additional costs.' Xephon, the
UK-based IT consultancy takes an extreme position: 'Far from being obsolete,
mainframes currently offer the most cost effective computing facilities for
all but the smallest organisations - and will continue to do so for the
foreseeable future.'
Xephon supports its claim with a series of calculations on the cost of
hardware, including terminals, printers and other peripherals; the cost of
applications software; and the cost of operating the system.
To illustrate this, it uses as examples a pair of IBM mainframe
configurations supporting several thousand users, comparing the cost of
these systems with a group of proprietary and Unix-based midrange systems
from IBM, DEC and Hewlett Packard and a selection of personal computers,
including the cost of printers and networking hardware and software.
Xephon calculated basic hardware and software costs over five years for
these systems (excluding finance costs and ignoring inflation) and decided
the cost per end user was Pounds 1,545 to Pounds 2,236 for mainframes,
Pounds 1,806 to Pounds 2,286 for proprietary midrange machines, Pounds 1,680
to Pounds 2,240 for Unix systems and Pounds 2,900 to Pounds 9,000 for PCs
running on a local area network.
But mainframes and midrange systems take up floor space and may have special
environmental requirements. That takes the cost of mainframes per user up to
Pounds 2,479 to Pounds 3,170, with smaller increases for the midrange
machines. PC network costs were not affected.
Finally, Xephon added the cost of applications software, the cost of
specialist support to help out when users are unable to help themselves, and
the cost of employees' time wasted because small systems respond more slowly
than mainframes. The result was striking. Mainframes cost between Pounds
5,282 and Pounds 5,973 per user, proprietary midrange systems Pounds 7,306
and Pounds 7786, Unix systems Pounds 7,180 to Pounds 7,740 and networked
personal computers, Pounds 9,400 to Pounds 15,500.
It is possible to take issue with the assumptions Xephon has made in
arriving at these figures. What is not in question is that downsizing
involves costs that are neither obvious or negligible and are frequently
ignored in making the case for downsizing.
Input, the US-based consultancy, says the proper justification for
downsizing must be directly related to the contribution that a new
information architecture can make to business objectives.
In other words, beware of fashion, a curse of the data processing business.
Slavid may yet be proved right.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Triplex Lloyd, the West Midlands engineering group which today announces its
results for the half year to end-September, is promoting 36-year-old finance
director John Foley (left) to the new position of group managing director
under Colin Cooke, who remains executive chairman.
Cooke had stepped into the breach as both executive chairman and chief
executive when Jim Dael died suddenly in July of last year at the age of 46.
Cooke had previously been non-executive deputy chairman, with a number of
outside directorships after a career at RTZ, Hepworth, GKN and Duport.
Foley, the youngest member of the board, says the move comes 'because the
rest of the board think I am ready for it'. He adds that he is not aware
there were any other internal or external candidates for the position.
Triplex is viewed as having steered a relatively successful course through
the recession with the recent growth of the business focused in the
automotive and power divisions, rather than the building products division.
Foley has been finance director for the past three years. He had joined from
Foseco, where he had latterly been director of corporate finance. A trained
barrister, who says he did not continue in the law because he could not
afford to at the time, he trained as a chartered accountant with Price
Waterhouse.

FT  15 DEC 92 / People: 'A very good fit', to coin a phrase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Holmes is not prepared to venture a comment on what he thinks of the
new 10p coin. 'I have to learn more about the options, about what goes into
making coins.'
No numismatist himself, the new deputy master and chief executive of the
Royal Mint who left the board of Chloride in the summer, reckons the job is
'a very good fit' given his own mixture of private and public sector
experience.
The Royal Mint, which boasts a 1,100 year history of producing coinage, and
which is now an executive agency in the context of the Next Steps
initiative, is a significant international business, last financial year
turning over Pounds 83m (Pounds 60.4m of which was in export sales) and
recording profits of Pounds 11m.
Master of the Royal Mint is the chancellor of the exchequer, but this is an
ex officio position, so that deputy master is both the chief executive and
effectively the chairman of the board of directors. Holmes, who takes over
at the beginning of next year, succeeds Tony Garrett, 64, who was the first
deputy master to be appointed from the private sector.
Holmes' career began at the Board of Trade/DTI, where he rose to the
position of assistant secretary. In 1980, he was seconded to British
Leyland, from where he followed Sir Michael Edwardes to Mercury
International.
He then 'took the plunge', as he puts it, into the private sector, in 1984,
joining ICL, again following in Sir Michael's footsteps.
He spent six months at Dunlop before it was swallowed by BTR and has been on
the board of Chloride for the past six years. Corporate operations director
for the second half of his stint, he was responsible for the overseas
battery business in Asia and Africa, and had all central functions, apart
from finance, reporting to him.
On completion of the large-scale divestment programme aimed at repairing the
battered Chloride balance sheet, he left in the summer - having worked
himself out of a job, he says - a few months after Keith Hodgkinson, who was
recruited from GEC, was made chief executive.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Technology: Research faces uncertain future - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tensions behind the scenes over the UK government's forthcoming Science and
Technology White Paper erupted in public as the deadline for submissions
passed last week. Dai Rees, Medical Research Council secretary, made an
astonishing attack on the 'amazing and appalling' proposals put forward by
the government-appointed Advisory Council on Science and Technology.
Acost advocates abolishing the five research councils that distribute about
Pounds 1bn a year in grants and contracts.
Instead, it wants the government to set up one agency to support 'curiosity
driven research' and another to fund 'mission oriented research'.
Acost - whose members include industrialists and academic researchers - also
proposes to privatise the research councils' units and institutes.
Rees told a press conference the Acost proposals were 'naive and wrongly
founded, and far from the best interests of the nation. 'We regard the
integration of basic and clinical work as absolutely vital to our mission,'
he said.
Rees warned that privatised research units 'will need to employ armies of
administrators, PR people and marketing experts to ensure that they can
survive.'
Acost's scheme would mean providers of basic research would compete for
funds in a free market. Such an approach might appeal to the present
government, but it would be extremely damaging to the long term continuity
of Britain's world-class scientific teams.
Some distinguished members of Acost, including Sir Michael Atiyah, president
of the Royal Society, have quietly dissociated themselves from its
proposals.
But Rees rightly felt he had to speak out because 'Acost was constituted to
give scientific advice to the prime minister, so anything it says may be
taken seriously.'
The Acost submission is one of 520 documents received during the
government's White Paper consultation period.
'All the views expressed will be taken on board and fed into our thinking,'
said William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for science.
However, he and Bill Stewart, chief scientific adviser in the Cabinet
Office, will find it extremely hard to draw together common threads from so
many contradictory and inevitably self-interested views.
They would waste an opportunity if they did not consider making radical
changes, since this is the government's first fundamental review of science
and technology since the 1971 Rothschild report.
But the area crying out for far-reaching reform is not basic research - the
research councils are doing a reasonable job, though there is scope for some
reorganisation.
What needs to change is the way the government funds and conducts industrial
and applied R&amp;D.
The Office of Science and Technology, which John Major set up after the
General Election as part of the Cabinet Office, is directly responsible only
for basic research. It should be given new powers to co-ordinate R&amp;D across
the whole government, in collaboration with industry.
The Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry, in
particular, carry out important R&amp;D programmes that seem often to lose out
in the internal competition for departmental funds.
The MoD spends hundreds of millions of pounds a year supporting technologies
such as advanced materials, electronics and computing, which must be
protected from the run-down in military spending and redirected towards
civil industry.
The challenge Waldegrave faces is convincing his cabinet colleagues to
surrender some control over their departmental R&amp;D, to give Britain its
first co-ordinated national policy for science and technology.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Untying the tangle of red
tape - Excessive bureaucracy is an unnecessarily costly burden on companies
and, say critics, it stifles enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is seven years since the government set up a special deregulation unit to
fight red tape. Yet an official review of the bureaucracy with which
businesses have to deal has unearthed more than 6,000 pieces of legislation
and 2,500 forms still in existence.
However assiduous government is in attempting to reduce bureaucracy, all its
efforts are undone by the weight of new legislation. The 1980 edition of
Butterworth's Company Law, a basic reference work for the legal profession,
was just 486 pages thick.
By 1991 it ran to 3,544 pages, Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister,
said last week at the launch of a new government campaign to reduce the
burdens on business.
The cost to business of complying with regulations is similar to the defence
budgets of many developed countries, Graham Bannock, a small firms
consultant, calculates.
Nor is the burden equally spread. Small businesses employing fewer than 15
people spend the equivalent of 2.5 per cent of their turnover dealing with
value added tax payments alone while companies employing up to 500 people
devote just 0.07 per cent, Bannock says.
The owner of a small electrical contracting business employing two people
who set out to master government regulations relating to his operations
would have to read 26 booklets running to nearly 270,000 words, the Forum of
Private Business calculated in 1984.
The forum has not repeated the exercise but believes that, if anything, the
burden has grown heavier.
Most time is taken up in dealing with Customs &amp; Excise, which administers
VAT, and with the Inland Revenue which handles income tax. Business owners
also have to deal with employment regulations, health and safety issues and
local authority planning decisions. European Community directives also now
play an important part in the lives of many businesses.
The announcement last week of a renewed deregulation drive by government
coincided with the launch by the Institute of Directors of its own campaign
to reduce red tape. The IOD has been sniping at individual examples of
excessive regulation over the past year but has decided to put its efforts
on a more permanent basis.
Peter Morgan, director general, urged the government to deregulate in areas
which would have an immediate impact on the economy and job-creation.
Action which could be taken without the need for legislation would be
particularly useful, he said. But he warned against attempts to reduce costs
to government by simply transferring the burden to business.
The government, for its part, expects to complete its review of business
legislation within the next few weeks. Departments will then draw up a list
of priorities for action to reduce the burden.
From next April they will carry out a rolling review of regulations to
ensure that pressure is kept up to minimise their impact.
Hamilton will make monthly reports to John Major, the prime minister, on the
performance of different ministries.
Officials will be expected to make use of risk assessment and management
techniques and to carry out regular assessments of the compliance costs of
new regulations.
A guide for officials and businessmen will be published before Christmas.
Government departments frequently underestimated the impact of regulations,
Hamilton said. The Home Office had estimated the cost of new fire
regulations at Pounds 1.7bn but the Association of District Surveyors had
calculated the cost at Pounds 8bn.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Owners driven up the wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One year on, Barry Staples, managing director of Staples Group, is still
furious about the visits he had from officials from the Health and Safety
Executive.
The first suggested that he paint the bare breeze blocks which made up the
factory wall. More seriously, she noticed unguarded machinery which needed
to be protected.
She then asked for a chance to talk to the workforce. Staples says he did
not sit in on the meeting in the canteen but staff came out apparently
fearful that the factory might be closed down. As the official was leaving
she told Staples he was lucky that she was not marching him off to
magistrates' court.
Incensed by what he felt was heavy-handed treatment Staples contacted his MP
and also asked for a meeting with a more senior health and safety official.
Far from improving matters, this visit enraged Staples further. A request
for more advice on complying with the rules, Staples recalls, met with the
response that the official's job was to ensure that the law was obeyed by
prosecution and not by advice.
Staples says he took immediate action to guard the machinery but, less
impressed with the need to paint the factory wall, he delayed the work until
the next factory shutdown. These visits left him, he says, with some
sympathy for companies which avoided the mass of regulation surrounding
business by sub-contracting out their manufacturing to low-cost countries.
Ironically, Staples had only recently moved into manufacture. For the first
100 years of its existence it was a distribution and marketing company,
supplying the clothing industry with a range of accessories including zips,
elastics, labels and cutting room supplies.
Six years ago the Huddersfield-based company started manufacturing, buying a
company making shoulder pads and establishing its own paper converting
operation to produce the specialist papers required by the clothing
industry. This shift of emphasis - manufacture now accounts for 60 per cent
of turnover - brought the company into contact with a new set of
regulations.
'You have to become an instant expert,' says Staples who, with his brother,
Robert, is the fourth generation of his family to run the business. 'It is
impossible for a company to be run legally. I have to know every UK
regulation and European Community directive related to manufacturing
otherwise I am guilty. You hear of companies giving up manufacturing because
of the hassle.'
If it were only a question of dealing with the health and safety rules the
problem might not be so bad. But the complaint of Staples and many other
businessmen is that while individual pieces of legislation might be
manageable they have to deal with a welter of different regulations.
Staples is currently writing a new software programme to handle the changes
to the VAT regulations which take effect on January 1 when the European
single market comes into being.
He is 60 per cent through the writing of his software programme but says the
new system make life difficult for business. He is unable to fill in
Customs' Intrastat form, detailing his imports and exports, by pen but must
type it in. He cannot use a standard computer print-out but must put the
data into a special format.
'It suits them but it doesn't suit business,' comments Staples. 'This is
just one of the hundreds of things that we have to get right. 'I work an
18-hour day and I have not had a completely free weekend for over a year.
The effort is colossal and it is totally non-productive.'
The administrative demands placed on a company with just two directors, one
general manager and a workforce of 60 people are completely unreasonable,
Staples believes. 'We are still ahead of the game but I am having to leave
it to my brother to run the business. When it comes to meeting regulations
you can never argue that you cannot afford it.'
The Health and Safety Executive said that regulations requiring factory
walls to be kept clean by being painted or whitewashed dated back to the
Factories Act of 1961. Safety and conditions in factories and offices are
governed by three separate pieces of legislation, aspects of which are being
superseded by new European Community-inspired regulations which take effect
next month. Inspectors provide advice where possible but sometimes encounter
business owners who are either not interested in safety issues or are
adversarial.

in Brussels - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurochambres, the Brussels-based organisation which represents 1,200
chambers of commerce in 23 European countries, is taking steps to increase
its effectiveness. In the past it has been short of funds and has frequently
been overshadowed by the Brussels offices of the different national chamber
organisations.
A new, three-strong management team has been appointed; member chamber
organisations have been persuaded to double their subscriptions; and fresh
thought has gone into its future role. The catalyst for the changes has been
Sir Thomas Macpherson, a 'company doctor,' who became president a year ago.
Eurochambres plans to strengthen its policy teams to be able to lobby more
effectively at the European Commission. It will also provide a valuable
mouthpiece for national chambers which do not have a Brussels office,
including the Association of British Chambers of Commerce.

A Pounds 300,000 low-interest rate fund to back small businesses in London
has been launched by Greater London Enterprise, Midland Bank and the nine
London Training and Enterprise Councils.
The London Business Growth Fund will provide unsecured loans of up to Pounds
10,000 over three years at a rate of 2 percentage points below base rate to
established small firms. The fund will also provide loans of up to Pounds
5,000 to start-up businesses run by people with disabilities, members of
ethnic minorities, women and the long-term unemployed.
This fund brings to 17 the number of local small business funds backed by
Midland and the amount of finance available to Pounds 3.57m, much of it at

Litigation between British Aerospace and Dee Howard of the US should be
heard in an English court and not in America, the High Court has ruled.
Dee Howard is suing BAe for Dollars 50m in a Texas court for alleged failure
to provide materials under a technical assistance agreement for the
re-engining of BAC 1-11 aircraft. BAe is counterclaiming Dollars 6m in
unpaid invoices and damages for breach of contract.
Mr Justice Waller ruled that the agreement between the companies contained
an exclusive jurisdiction clause under English law. The judgment is
considered by some lawyers as an important clarification of English law on
exclusive and non-exclusive jurisdiction.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Chance in China - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
City solicitors Lovell White Durrant are justifiably proud of having been
chosen as one of only five overseas law firms to be awarded a licence to
practise in Beijing by the Chinese government. But, given the current state
of relations between the UK and China over the future of Hong Kong , it
could be said that, apart from the prestige, there is little practical
benefit for a British law firm in such a singular honour.
Not so, says Mr Christopher Smith, head of Lovell's China practice. Even
without a privatisation programme, China is attracting more foreign
investment than the combined privatisation programmes of central and eastern
Europe.
Czechoslovakia attracted less than Dollars 1bn in its first round of
privatisations; Russia hopes to attract up to Dollars 5bn over two years. In
the first six months of 1992, China attracted commitments of Dollars 10bn,
more than 80 per cent of it from China's 50m expatriates in south-east Asia
who are believed to have Dollars 2,000bn in liquid assets ready to invest.
None of the countries of central and eastern Europe have this kind of
expatriate resource. Even the Japanese, with 100m people, are thought to
have only Dollars 3,000bn in liquid assets.
Eventually large sectors of Chinese industry will be controlled by
expatriate Chinese, says Mr Smith, forcing the government to open up
investment possibilities in the state sector in order to modernise it while
keeping a measure of control, and encourage investment from other
nationalities. All of which means lots of work for lawyers - particularly
those already there.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Proposal for chair of legal education
 -Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Are UK lawyers receiving the education and training they need to meet the
rapidly changing demands of practising law in the 1990s?
In spite of new vocational courses from the Bar and the Law Society and a
general shift in attitudes towards the teaching of law in recent years, a
significant body of opinion within the profession believes UK legal
education is headed in the wrong direction.
The problem facing the profession as it struggles to come to terms with the
internationalisation of legal practice and rising public expectations about
the quality of professional services, is how to determine the right
direction. Evidence of dissatisfaction from end-users exists. Industry, for
example, frequently complains of a lack of 'commercial awareness' among
young lawyers. But no analysis is carried out to see what can be done to
improve matters.
Lord Woolf, the Law Lord, speaking in his capacity as chairman of the board
of the University of London's Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, and
Professor Terence Daintith, director of the IALS, believe the time has come
to set up a chair of legal education in the UK to provide an assured
capacity for research into the structure and content of legal education. The
chair would be based at the IALS but funded externally.
Prof Daintith estimates the cost of running the post for an initial
five-year period at Pounds 118,000 a year. The bulk of the money will have
to come from the practising profession, but both he and Lord Woolf are
adamant that it will represent an excellent investment for the legal
profession. It is not so much a question of can we afford it, but 'can we
afford not to do it', Lord Woolf says.

FT  15 DEC 92 / European Court: Sex discrimination case opens
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Last week the European Court held the oral hearing in the second Marshall
sex discrimination case. In the first Marshall case, the Court ruled that
Miss Marshall was entitled to rely on the provisions of an EC directive in
her action for wrongful dismissal on grounds of sex discrimination against
her employers, Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority.
Following the European Court's ruling, the case was remitted to the
industrial tribunal to consider the question of compensation. Under UK
legislation, the maximum compensation which could be paid at the relevant
time was Pounds 6,250. The industrial tribunal assessed Miss Marshall's loss
at Pounds 18,405, which included Pounds 7,700 in interest.
The area health authority paid the capital sum, but appealed against the
tribunal's award of interest. The appeal went to the House of Lords which
referred it to the European Court.
The case raises several important points, including the obligations of EC
states to provide effective judicial protection of individuals' Community
rights and what constitutes adequate compensation in such situations. The
advocate general's opinion and the Court's ruling are expected next year.
C-271/91: Marshall v Southampton and South West Area Health Authority.
Frontier workers' rights clarified.
The Court has provided further clarification of the position relating to
social security benefits paid to individuals who are resident in one member
state and work in another.
The case concerned a woman who worked in Northern Ireland and resided in the
Irish Republic with her husband and four children. She received child
benefit in Ireland but then applied for it in Northern Ireland, where
benefit levels were higher. The Northern Irish Court of Appeal referred the
matter to the European Court.
The general rule under EC law is that the laws of the country of employment
apply. But where an individual has a family in the state of residence, they
are entitled to family benefits provided by that state. This rule does not
apply, however, when the family already receives benefits given on the basis
of a professional or trade activity carried on in the state of residence by
the person entitled to the benefits or by the person to whom they are paid.
In this case the husband carried on a trade but he was not the person
entitled to the benefits. His wife should therefore have been entitled to
benefits in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Court ruled that the
persons entitled to benefits included persons who had care of the children,
which in this case was the husband, so the only benefits available were
those from the Irish authorities.
C-119/91: McMenamin v Adjudication Officer, ECJ 5CH, December 9 1992.
Nestle/Perrier
The European Commission's decision on the Nestle/Perrier merger is to be
challenged in the Court of First Instance by representatives of the Perrier
workforce.
They argue that the merger should not have been cleared because it reduced
the centres of competition in the bottled water market from three to two.
They question the Commission's power to restructure the market through
merger approval, and say that it should have prevented the disappearance of
the third competitor rather than first allowing it to be destroyed and then
requiring it to be recreated.
They also say the Commission should have ensured the merger did not infringe
'fundamental social rights recognised by Community law' and claim they were
not given a proper opportunity to participate in the proceedings.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Patent improvement - Robert Rice
explains how changes to EC regulations will affect the Community's
pharmaceutical industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks like being a happy new year for Europe's pharmaceutical industry:
on January 2, after years of wrangling and intensive lobbying, the European
Community will adopt a regulation granting up to five years' extra patent
protection for drugs.
The extension of the effective period of marketing exclusivity for drugs
through a system of supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) is designed
to give pharmaceutical companies a fair return on the growing cost of
researching and developing new drugs, and to prevent research work moving
from the EC to the US or Japan where drugs already enjoy extended patent
protection.
As with all legislation born of political compromise, however, the European
SPC system is far from straightforward. The procedure for obtaining a
certificate is complex. The extent to which different EC states can alter
the effect of the regulation by the way they implement it threatens a
bureaucratic and administrative nightmare. Generic producers and companies
making patented drugs under licence face a period of uncertainty.
For a long time, there has been widespread concern that necessary safety
testing for new drugs imposes a heavy penalty on pharmaceutical inventions
compared with other sectors of technology.
Patents in Europe generally last a maximum of 20 years from the application
date. But, according to Ms Patricia Harris, an intellectual property lawyer
with City solicitors Lovell White Durrant, the development period for new
drugs - from discovery to marketing authorisation - lasts an average of 12
years. In complex areas of research into diseases currently regarded as
incurable such as Alzheimer's, motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis,
the development time may be even longer.
This means that by the time they have obtained approval to market the drug,
companies have little of the patent term left in which to use their monopoly
rights to recoup the increasingly heavy costs of research and development,
she says.
Although there has been little evidence of research migrating to the US or
Japan, where patent protection is longer, or of it being abandoned, European
governments accepted that it would be foolhardy to wait for signs of decline
in the EC pharmaceutical industry before taking action.
Consumer organisations, however, warned that extended patent protection
could push up the overall drugs bill for public health services across
Europe by restricting the market for generic products.
But governments recognised that, far from pushing up the overall drugs bill,
extended protection could be used to drive pharmaceutical prices down, says
Mr Martin Paltnoi, a pharmaceuticals marketing consultant. This is because,
once a reasonable period of marketing exclusivity is guaranteed, the
rationale for allowing drug companies to charge high prices to recoup
development costs over an uncertain and short period of patent cover no
longer exists.
Working out the duration of an SPC will not be easy. It will be available
for the length of a drug's development period minus five years and for a
maximum of five years. The development period is defined as the time between
filing the patent in the EC country in which the SPC is sought and the date
that it is first authorised for use in the EC as a whole.
Ms Harris says this means that if the development period is five years or
less no supplementary protection will be available. If the development
period is between five and 10 years an SPC of up to five years will be
available, and for development periods of between 10 and 20 years a full
five-year SPC will apply.
The procedures are also complex. A separate application will have to be made
in the patent office of each member state in which supplementary protection
is required. Applications will have to be filed within six months of the
drug being authorised for use in the relevant country. For drugs already
patented and authorised in the relevant member state on January 2 1993,
transitional provisions will apply and any applications for an SPC must be
filed by July 2 1993.
Under the transitional provisions for SPCs, a product must generally have
been first authorised for use in the EC after January 1 1985. However,
Belgium, Italy, Germany and Denmark have adopted different dates, while the
transitional provisions will not apply at all in Greece, Portugal and Spain,
where the regulation will not come into force until 1998. To complicate
matters further, the Spanish government has started proceedings in the
European Court to have the regulation set aside.
The changes mean an administrative headache for the national patent
agencies, Mr Paltnoi believes, as they struggle to find out when and where
in the EC a drug was first authorised for use in order to calculate the
length of an SPC. Without a pooling of international data, accurate
verification of first authorisation may prove impossible in many cases, he
warns.
Ms Harris warns of an uncertain period for companies producing patented
drugs under licence. Licences are usually expressed to last 'for the
duration of the patent'. But an SPC does not extend the patent, it simply
grants additional protection. Licensees who want a continued exclusive
licence to produce and market a drug under an SPC will have to renegotiate
their licence agreements.
The SPCs will go some way towards meeting the industry's requirements for an
adequate period of patent protection in Europe, says Ms Harris. It will also
be watched with interest by other industries, such as agrochemicals, which
also experience problems in recouping R&amp;D costs because of the length of
time it takes to obtain marketing authorisations.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Consumers body cautions on free flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER, the home appliance brand owned by US manufacturer Maytag, seems to
be making an offer hard to refuse.
Customers spending at least Pounds 100 - slightly less than the price of the
company's cheapest vacuum cleaner - are being offered 'two free return
flights to the US.'
But the Consumers Association, which has already received some complaints
about the offer, suggests it may be a good idea to study the small print.
Hoover refused yesterday to discuss details of customer response to its
heavily advertised offer. It has increased production, particularly at its
Cambuslang factory in Lanarkshire, but will not say by how much.
The company said yesterday no figures for sales of appliances would be
issued until the promotion closes at the end of this month - if they are
issued at all.
Mr Keith Richards, a barrister with the Consumers Association, said he was
particularly concerned about the stipulation that the 'free flight voucher
cannot be used with any free accommodation or free ownership offers, unless
authorised by Hoover'.
He said that might rule out anyone wishing to stay with relatives or
friends.
Mr Richards said the Consumers' Association had received few complaints yet
concerning the Hoover offer, but had found with similar offers from other
companies that while the flights were given away free, accommodation was
often tied to them.
'What people have complained about is the requirement to book accommodation
through a specified agent from a specified list of hotels. They have
discovered that if they ring up the hotels direct, they are offered the same
accommodation at half the price. If they had bought a bucket-shop flight and
booked the accommodation themselves, they could probably have got the whole
package cheaper than through the free flight-with-tied-accommodation
offers.'
Hoover said the company would not use the clause in that way. 'If you wish
to stay with friends or relatives or make your own accommodation
arrangements then you are perfectly free to do that. This is a
no-strings-attached promotion.'
Hoover needs to sell more domestic appliances. Hoover Europe made a Dollars
16.2m (Pounds 10.60m) deficit in the first nine months of this year,
compared with an Dollars 8.9m loss for the same period last year.
Mr Tony Barton of The Marketing Store, a sales promotion specialist agency,
said: 'All travel offers in the end come down to the small print. While
promotions like these shift product, in the long term they can be
counterproductive if the consumer discovers that the conditions are onerous.
In any case it can only be a short-term measure for Hoover. How many vacuum
cleaners does one need?'
Hoover does not require customers to book accommodation, but, as Mr Richards
pointed out, 'It is very difficult to book your own accommodation direct, if
you don't know precisely when your flights are going to be - and there is no
guarantee that you will get the flight dates you nominate.'

FT  15 DEC 92 / Spending curbs on BBC criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN TUSA, outgoing managing director of the BBC World Service, attacked
the government yesterday for planning to cut the organisation's budget by
Pounds 5m a year from 1994.
The prospect of a reduced budget comes as the World Service, which has a
regular audience of 120m worldwide, celebrates its 60th anniversary. Last
week Prince Charles argued that the BBC World Service should continue to
expand services.
Mr Tusa said his argument was not with the Foreign Office, which funds the
World Service through grants, but the Treasury, which was threatening the
cut.
Mr Tusa said: 'If this cut goes ahead, it will go straight to programmes. It
will be very, very damaging.'
A Pounds 5m-a-year reduction from next year's Pounds 172m budget would mean
the loss of about seven hours of foreign-language broadcasting a week.
The BBC opens negotiations with the Foreign Office next year for its next
three-year funding period, which runs from April 1994.
Mr Tusa said: 'It seems to me we cannot start with the assumption that,
whatever happens in the negotiations, we get Pounds 5m less.'
He also argued that there should be more practical co-operation between the
government-funded World Service radio and World Service Television, which is
funded through the commercial arm of the BBC.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Brick mountain walls in builders: Andrew Taylor finds
serious overcapacity among construction materials producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH construction industry, already reeling from the worst recession
for more than half a century, is bracing itself for another round of company
failures, plant closures and job losses.
Overcapacity among contractors and building material producers is such that
further cuts are inevitable, even if the recession were to end tomorrow.
As it is, most forecasters expect construction demand to fall further next
year - by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent - in spite of measures to
encourage greater expenditure on building announced in the government Autumn
Statement.
Redundancies will consequently continue to rise in an industry that has
already lost more than 400,000 jobs since summer 1989.
According to Mr Howard Seymour, construction analyst for stockbrokers
Barclays de Zoete Wedd: 'Even if construction demand were to stabilise at
levels prevailing in 1986, which was a reasonably good year for output and
sales, there would still be substantial overcapacity.'
At the heart of the industry's troubles is the massive investment in new
capacity made by companies in the late 1980s to meet booming demand for new
buildings.
Brick manufacturers are estimated to have spent more than Pounds 200m on new
plant during the period, only to find that demand for their products shrank
as housing and commercial property markets went into recession.
Brick producers increased production capacity from 4.5bn bricks a year to
5bn between 1987 and 1989. Closures and mothballing of kilns have now
reduced capacity to 3.7bn. Even so, sales of bricks this year will be less
than 3bn, or 19 per cent less than kilns are capable of producing.
The effect of such overcapacity has been a savage reduction in prices
charged by building material producers and contractors. Mr Robert Napier,
managing director of Redland, one of the country's biggest building
materials producers, estimates that prices of concrete, bricks and tiles
have fallen by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in the past 12 months.
'It is madness,' Mr Napier says. 'In south-east England we are virtually
giving away valuable finite reserves of sand and gravel, at very little
profit.
'The only way that prices can recover is if inefficient plants and producers
are removed from the market, preferably through mergers and subsequent
rationalisation.'
That may be difficult to achieve in markets where there are many very small
family-owned companies. They have no other business interests to fall back
on, and therefore seek to increase volume when profits fall, thus putting
even greater strain on prices.
The only solution for larger companies may be to buy out small businesses or
wait for them to fail.
Meanwhile, annual sales of ready-mixed concrete, one of the most basic of
building materials, have declined by almost a third since 1989 from 29.6m cu
metres to 20m. Manufacturing capacity has been reduced by only about 2m cu
metres during the period.
The overheads of running a concrete-mixing plant, with its much lower use of
energy, are small by comparison with a brick or cement works. The incentive
to close a plant, which might mean losing an entire local market, is
therefore much less.
Profits on ready-mixed concrete have fallen to about Pounds 1 a tonne
compared with Pounds 4 to Pounds 5 a tonne three years ago. Mr Napier says
producers that lack their own supply of aggregates can only be selling at a
loss.
Road construction is one of the few areas of building and civil engineering
to have withstood the recession. Sales of coated stone are holding at about
37 1/2 m tonnes a year. Unfortunately, blacktop manufacturing capacity has
risen even faster than sales. In the Thames Valley alone there is estimated
surplus capacity of at least 5m tonnes a year. Prices have plummeted, and
most blacktop producers will be making a loss on sales, according to the
industry.
Steel producers have also suffered as construction demand has dwindled. More
than 100 steel fabricators have ceased trading or gone into receivership
since 1989, according to the British Constructional Steelwork Association.
Numbers employed by the industry have fallen from 60,000 to 40,000.
In spite of those reductions, capacity continues to outstrip demand. Almost
90,000 tonnes of construction steel is estimated to have been sold this
year, compared with a potential manufacturing capacity of about 1.1m tonnes.
The arithmetic is inescapable: building material producers must continue
working on short time, or introduce extended closures over Christmas (as
seems increasingly likely), or plants will have to be mothballed or closed
permanently.
Contractors face similar overcapacity. Competition for work is intense. Many
contractors are winning work at a loss or bidding for work at prices that
only just cover their overheads, according to Sir Brian Hill, president of
the Building Employers Confederation, the industry's biggest trade
association.
The overriding need is to generate cash from progress payments to meet
monthly bills and pay off borrowings, Sir Brian says. 'The construction
industry faces a long haul before output reaches a level where the rise in
unemployment will first be checked, and then reversed.'

FT  15 DEC 92 / CBI attacks government for lack of London traffic plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry yesterday attacked the government for
failing to draw up a co-ordinated strategy for tackling London's transport.
It said responsibility for transport in the capital was divided between 60
organisations, and a single body was needed to co-ordinate their efforts.
Mr Ian Reeves, chairman of the CBI's London region transport task force,
said: 'Congestion is seen as London's biggest problem, costing business
Pounds 10bn a year.' It could not be solved by a fragmented approach.
Mr Reeves was speaking at the launch of a 32-page report that sharply
criticises the Treasury and Department of Transport for their handling of
the capital's transport.
The report suggests:
A single organisation, working with government departments, should pull
together the capital's transport, land use and environmental policies into a
co-ordinated plan.
The government should explore new ways of involving the private sector in
funding transport projects.
Patterns of demand should be changed - say, by smoothing out rush-hour peaks
and rationalising goods deliveries.
Society's dependency on cars should be reduced by making public transport
alternatives more attractive.
Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said the capital already
had as coherent a transport strategy as any big city in the world. 'The
report tells us nothing we don't already know and asks us to do nothing we
are not already doing,' he said.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Accounts watchdog may make criticisms public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the UK's watchdog of accounting
standards, may start to make public criticisms of accounting practices where
they confuse readers of accounts.
The move would mark a shift from the panel's formal legal role in
reprimanding companies that breach the 1985 Companies Act in their annual
published accounts.
It marks a growing sense of frustration among panel members that companies
are producing accounts that do not break the law but which do not serve the
best interests of shareholders and creditors.
The panel already refers such matters to the Accounting Standards Board for
consideration as topics for revised standards.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, the review
panel's parent body, said there was 'considerable disquiet' over companies
operating within the letter, but not the spirit, of the law.
He warned that typical accounting abuses might be highlighted in future
copies of the FRC's annual review - probably without reference to the
companies.
In the second edition of the review, published yesterday, Mr Edwin Glasgow,
chairman of the review panel, said there was a considerable 'grey area'
between 'sophisticated accounting standards' and the 'disarmingly simple'
legal requirement for accounts to show a true and fair view.
Figures compiled since the report was printed show that the panel is
scrutinising 17 companies' accounts for potential breaches of accounting
standards.
It has examined 81 companies since it was created in the middle of last
year, based on referrals generated roughly evenly between audit reports,
press comment and from individuals and organisations. Of those, 29 were not
pursued beyond an initial examination, while 35 cases have been resolved,
including 10 in which public statements were made.
The panel has also written to the directors of 240 companies that failed to
include in their accounts a note of compliance with applicable accounting
standards.

THE Independent on Sunday has agreed to apologise and pay substantial
undisclosed damages to Mr Conrad Black, publisher of The Daily Telegraph,
over a report about plans for the newspaper's flotation earlier this year.
The report alleged that concern had been caused by Mr Black's retention of
control through Hollinger, his Canadian company, and that being a minority
shareholder in one of Mr Black's business interests had not always been a
pleasant experience. It also suggested Mr Black had manipulated his Canadian
company assets to enrich himself at the expense of minority shareholders.
In reaching the out-of-court settlement, The Independent on Sunday accepted
there was no truth in the allegations.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE FIRST nationwide ballot on industrial action against market testing in
the Civil Service begins later this week and may lead to serious disruption
in the Inland Revenue, David Goodhart writes.
The Inland Revenue Staff Federation is asking its 50,000 members to vote for
a policy of non-co-operation if, as expected, the government decides to
extend market testing in the Revenue beyond the experiments being undertaken
with secretarial staff.
The result is not expected until January. Mr Clive Brooke, IRSF general
secretary, is warning of a 'spring of discontent' next year in the Civil
Service when disputes over implementing the government's 1.5 per cent
public-sector pay squeeze will coincide with a wave of market testing.
The government has identified more than 3,000 Inland Revenue jobs for market
testing, the largest group in the Information Technology Office.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Post Office first-half profit leaps: Parcelforce loss cut to
Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:BY ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POST Office reported record pre-tax profits of Pounds 135m for the half
year to September 27 yesterday - more than double the Pounds 62m achieved
last year.
The increase was achieved largely through Pounds 70m of cost savings, mostly
from Royal Mail, the letters division. Turnover increased to Pounds 2.56bn
(Pounds 2.41bn).
Ministers are close to announcing their recommendation on the review of the
Post Office's structure, which may lead to privatisation.
Royal Mail's increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 62m to Pounds 131m, is
expected to bolster the arguments in favour of floating the division with
special incentives for employee participation.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman, while not wishing to comment on the
government's review, said: 'Whatever ministers decide, we would want to see
the highest level of employee involvement.'
It is understood that the Post Office has already submitted a report to the
government recommending that Royal Mail should be floated with special
incentives, such as share bonuses, to encourage employees to take part in
privatisation.
Sir Bryan repeated the Post Office's pledge to keep letter prices at their
present level until April.
'Prices will be frozen at least until next April . . . and will continue to
be held as long as possible,' he said.
The company's Parcelforce division recorded a loss of Pounds 21m, compared
with a loss of Pounds 27m. Sir Bryan said the division, which is for sale,
hoped to break even by the end of its financial year in March because it was
now in its strongest trading period.
Pre-tax profits from Post Office Counters, which sells stationery and pays
out pensions, declined from Pounds 24m to Pounds 12m. Sir Bryan described
the result as a 'short-term aberration' and predicted that it would recover
in the second half. It was the third successive fall in pre-tax profits.
The Post Office Users' National Council, the official postal services
watchdog, has accused the government of imposing 'unreasonable and
uncommercial' financial targets on the Post Office.
The Post Office's contribution to the government will rise by more than
Pounds 200m over the next two financial years.
The amount the Post Office has to generate from cashflow above its own
investment needs - negative external financing limits (EFLs) - will increase
from Pounds 68m in 1993-94 and Pounds 70m in 1994-95 to Pounds 180m in both
years.
Sir Bryan said he believed the financial targets were 'by and large fair'
and compared them to a dividend a private company would pay.
Capital expenditure is expected to have risen to Pounds 300m by the end of
the corporation's financial year. Sir Bryan said that suggested the Post
Office could both invest and meet its financial targets.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Financial Reporting Council willing to adopt audit board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL Reporting Council would be willing to consider taking
responsibility for auditing as well as accounting standards, its chairman
said yesterday.
Sir Ron Dearing said he would consider bringing the Auditing Practices Board
under the council's umbrella if the accountancy profession so wished.
Pressure has been growing for removal of the board from ownership of the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, the consortium of the six
leading accountancy professional bodies.
The council already controls the Accounting Standards Board and urgent
issues task force, which set new standards, and the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, which polices them.
The council was established to replace and enhance work on improving
financial reporting led by the Accounting Standards Committee, which was
controlled by the accountancy profession.
Sir Ron emphasised that the council was a new body that could not sustain
many new responsibilities over the next year. But he said: 'I am not making
a pitch, but in the longer term, if it was the wish of others, we would
provide a constructive response.'
Mr Bill Morrison, APB chairman, said recently he was willing to consider the
board becoming independent of the profession, but stressed that it had many
non-professional members and was not impeded by its existing ownership.
Mr John Roques, senior partner of Touche Ross, recently said that public
confidence in accounting could be restored only by removing audit
standard-setting and regulation and the development of ethical codes from
the profession.
Ernst &amp; Young has also called for a change in the regulatory regime.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Royal love letters disappoint: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS disappointment for Sotheby's yesterday when the most important
group of historical English letters to appear at auction for many years was
unsold.
The collection of 43 letters had been written by the Earl of Essex to Queen
Elizabeth I of England in the 1590s and, in parts, went beyond the
conventions of courtly love. Bids of more than Pounds 400,000 were expected
but not forthcoming.
The letters had been in the hands of the Hulton family for more than 300
years. A letter by Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, about the Spanish
Armada, also failed to sell, but a letter by Sir Francis Bacon made Pounds
13,200.
Another setback was the failure to dispose of John Osborne's autograph
manuscript of Look Back in Anger. Osborne was selling it in the hope of
raising Pounds 40,000 for dental work.
Among successes were a rare letter by William Blake, which made Pounds
19,800, and a Byron draft of a satire about George IV and his estranged
wife, Queen Caroline, which sold for Pounds 14,300. In the trivia, Muhammad
Ali's notes for a press conference in 1978, appealing for a rematch with
Leon Spinks, were unsold, but one of the last letters written by Ruth Ellis
in 1955 before her execution for murder made Pounds 1,100.
In the morning Sotheby's sold the Jeffrey Young collection of books and
manuscripts for Pounds 411,070. It was more than 13 per cent unsold and
included such gems as the dismissive letter Charlotte Bronte, signing
herself C. Bell, sent to the publishers Smith, Elder &amp; Co, accompanying her
manuscript of Jane Eyre. The manuscript was accepted immediately and the
novel published within six weeks. The letter sold for Pounds 66,000.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory rebels subdued by summit deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major was given a warm but not uncritical welcome by MPs as he
outlined the deal struck at the weekend's Edinburgh summit in the Commons
yesterday.
With government benches packed with loyalists and leaders of the other main
parties broadly in favour of what was agreed, Euro-sceptics were left with
relatively few opportunities to register dissent.
More surprising was the subdued tone adopted by many Maastricht opponents
when they were called on to speak. That in turn encouraged the loyalists,
who urged the prime minister to press ahead post-haste with the bill
implementing Maastricht 'even if it means staying up all night for a couple
of weeks'.
An ebullient Mr Major responded by pledging the bill's return to the Commons
shortly after the Christmas recess.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, targeted his criticism on the
'downgrading' of unemployment as a matter for concern 'throughout the whole
of the British presidency'.
With unemployment in Britain rising twice as fast as in any other EC
country, a return to economic growth and the stimulation of employment
should have been a crucial objective of the summit, he argued. 'Given the
appalling prospect of sharply rising unemployment, why was there no proposal
for an emergency economic programme right across the whole community?'
Mr Smith also taunted his opposite number that another summit outcome
appeared to be that the social chapter of Maastricht was 'alive and well and
fully supported by all other member states'.
But he welcomed both the settlement of the Danish question and the
enlargement plan, which he said would provide the EC with 'a new and healthy
dynamic.'
With Mr Paddy Ashdown away in Bosnia, it was left to Sir Russell Johnston,
the Liberal Democrats' European spokesman, to laud the summit's 'positive
outcome' that had consolidated progress towards European union. He asked for
Mr Major's assurance in the light of the Danish agreement that he did not
favour 'any two-tier solution for the community.'
In his opening address the prime minister hailed 'Britain's achievement' in
bringing Europe's member states together, arguing that making a success of
Britain's EC membership was not a matter of idealism but 'of hard-headed
self-interest'.
The EC had 'reached decisions on issues which many thought were insoluble,'
he said.
Later, following questions from a number of Scottish MPs, he highlighted a
distinction between subsidiarity - moving powers from international level to
national - and devolution - moving them from national to regional level.
There was a widespread and UK-wide appreciation of the importance of the
union.
Among the more vocal Euro-sceptics Ms Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay,
renewed her campaign for a referendum, saying Mr Major had no 'moral right'
to agree to finance the demands made by other EC countries 'without
consulting the British people'.
Mr Peter Shore, the Euro-sceptic Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney,
observed that Mr Major knew 'the difference between presentational and
substantial success, and you also know the difference between the applause
of European leaders and the applause of your own people'.
Adopting an ironic tone in the wake of the lavish praise for Mr Major
profferred by a succession of loyal Tories, Mr Ron Leighton, Labour MP for
Newham North East, predicted that his 'superhumanly brilliant' triumph would
leave most Europeans unmoved because it did not 'address any of their
concerns'.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Monarchy targeted in Benn proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSIONING off the royal family, disestablishing the Church of England and
abolishing the House of Lords were proposed by Mr Tony Benn yesterday in an
attempt to push the case for republicanism after the Queen's self-confessed
'annus horribilis'.
The Labour MP for Chesterfield's Commonwealth of Britain Bill was presented
to the Commons for the second time with its author able to claim that one
provision was already in place: the prime minister has announced that the
Queen will pay income tax from next year.
Mr Benn said that if the Maastricht treaty was ratified, the Queen's status
would be further undermined. She would, in effect, become a citizen of
Europe, able to vote in European elections. It would make a further mockery
of Britain's constitution based on 'a network of oaths of allegiance,' he
said.
Mr Benn - an opponent of Maastricht - said that 'to have an oath of
allegiance to another citizen in a European union is quite a big change,
much bigger than I'm proposing.'
He first presented the bill in the last parliament, when it was not even
discussed by MPs. But Mr Benn said it has provoked debate and had become a
set text for some students.
Moreover, in the past few weeks, with the separation of the Prince and
Princess of Wales, 'the magic and mystery' had disappeared from the
monarchy. His bill proposes the transfer of royal palaces to the state and
stripping all power from the monarch but giving her a state pension and
accommodation.
Mr Benn's bill would set up a House of Commons and a House of the People.
There would be an elected president, national parliaments for England,
Scotland and Wales, and a charter of rights. Britain would withdraw from
Northern Ireland.
The bill is extremely unlikely to be debated.

THE government's likely difficulties in parliament over the legislation to
privatise British Rail were underlined yesterday by two former Tory cabinet
ministers.
On BBC television's Panorama, Lord Ridley, a former transport secretary,
said he never believed it really possible to do very much, if anything, with
the railways because they were basically loss-making.
Lord Whitelaw, a former deputy prime minister, said that there were
considerable risks involved, and he was not sure it would be a success.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs told of agency 'fault'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Welsh Development Agency was savagely attacked in a Commons committee
yesterday over redundancy payments amounting to Pounds 2.37m to former
employees, reimbursement of car and petrol expenses paid to directors, a
grant paid to Dr Gwyn Jones, its chairman, and a pensions payment.
Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said
an 'astonishing tale' of evidence given to the committee indicated 'great
laxity' on the part of the agency.
He said: 'The evidence given has been very disconcerting. Standards shown
have been well below what the committee has a right to expect. We will be
presenting a very strong report.'
It also emerged under questioning before the committee that the Welsh Office
was unaware of changes in the scheme for redundancy payments introduced by
the agency.
Sir Richard Lloyd Jones, permanent secretary to the Welsh Office, told the
committee: 'We were not consulted in advance of the payments being made. We
would have been expected to have been told.'
The agency also admitted that it had been 'conned' by Mr Neil Smith over his
appointment as marketing director.
Mr Smith had admitted forging and then using references and CVs to obtain
pecuniary advantage and was last month jailed for two years for deception.
Mr Philip Head, the agency's chief executive, said: 'We were conned about
this appointment and the agency was at fault.'
The strongest criticism, however, came from Mr Alan Williams (Labour,
Swansea West), who questioned in particular redundancy and pensions
provision for Mr Michael Price, former director of Welsh Development
International, the agency's inward investment arm.
A package amounting to about Pounds 220,000 to one man was 'a lot of money
to buy silence,' he said. Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, yesterday
announced an 11 per cent rise in local-authority capital spending to boost
growth.

THE government is to bring forward a bill urgently in the new year to
increase the number of British Euro-constituencies in time for the 1994
election to the European parliament.
The legislation will come at a particularly sensitive time, since it will
have to be discussed while the Maastricht bill is still before the Commons.
It will also raise the question who will carry out the review, since the
parliamentary boundary commissioners are busy working on the review of the
boundaries for general election constituencies.
As part of the deal agreed at Edinburgh, in which Germany is to get an extra
18 MEPs to take account of unification, the UK, along with France and Italy,
will have six new seats to add to the existing 81 Euro-constituencies.
In order for the new arrangements to take effect for the June 1994 elections
the bill will have to be through parliament in time for the review to take
place, with enough time for the parties to select their candidates.
Officials are still working on proposals to go to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
home secretary, but one prospect is that - as when the Euro-seats were set
up - the process of holding inquiries will be compressed.
In the arrangements for the 1979 elections the boundary commissioners
published proposals locally and there was one month available for people to
make comments before final reports were presented to parliament. If such a
course was followed the whole exercise would take only about six months.
Even before that stage, there is the prospect of a political row as
ministers allocate the extra seats between England, Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. At present 66 of the British MEPs represent English seats,
eight represent Scotland, four Wales and three Northern Ireland.
Alongside the political difficulties of redistributing the seats is a
practical one. The boundary commission's existing work on Westminster
constituencies means that officials are having to consider the alternative
of co-opting former commissioners.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Dispute over repair to pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW has broken out between Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons
trade and industry committee, and Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal,
days before the committee completes taking evidence for its inquiry into the
future of the energy sector.
The dispute centres on whether British Coal should take immediate steps to
repair a deteriorating coalface at the Silverhill colliery in
Nottinghamshire, one of 10 pits where mining has stopped, pending completion
of the government's review of the coal industry.
In a private letter written earlier this month, Mr Caborn accused Mr Clarke
of 'a direct breach of British Coal's commitments to the committee'.
Mr Caborn has asked Lord Justice Glidewell and Mr Justice Hidden to consider
whether failure to repair the face during the review period might be a
breach of British Coal's commitments to the High Court.
In his correspondence with Mr Caborn Mr Clarke repeated British Coal's
assurance that 'any deterioration in the condition of faces' would be dealt
with 'if this might jeopardise either the fabric of the mine, or our ability
to re-establish coaling at that mine.'
He insisted: 'This is not the case at Silverhill.' He added: 'The integrity
of Silverhill Colliery has not been and will not be jeopardised.'
British Coal has undertaken to maintain the fabric of the 10 pits so that if
it is decided to re-establish coal production at any or all of them, it will
be possible to do so.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Dean Smith &amp; Grace to close
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE managing director of Dean Smith &amp; Grace, the Yorkshire machine tool
company due to be closed by its US owner in June, is trying to organise a
management buyout.
Ohio-based Monarch Machine Tool said last week it planned to relinquish
ownership of the Keighley-based company, which was founded in 1865 and is
one of the great names of the UK machine tool industry.
Dean Smith &amp; Grace is best known for its computer-controlled lathes. It
employs 82 people in its factory, but that is being reduced to 60. It also
has a foundry at Keighley employing 41 people.
The company employed more than 300 staff in 1990, but is heavily dependent
on the UK market and has suffered badly in the recession - sales last year
were Pounds 3.5m against Pounds 10m in 1989. Mr Richard Hole, managing
director for the past 17 years, is talking to financial institutions in
Leeds about a possible buyout.
Mr Hole said yesterday that trading had been sluggish since the company
completed two large orders in the UK, but in the past six weeks he had
detected 'the odd flicker' of life in the UK machine tool market. The
company had a Pounds 1m-plus order book.
The company has recently been successful with sales to the Middle East oil
industry, helping to reduce dependence on the UK to 70 per cent.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Coal gets boost from Eastern Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EASTERN Electricity gave coal a boost yesterday by becoming the first
regional electricity distributor to sign up a new deal for coal-based power.
But other companies seemed hesitant to follow suit.
Eastern, the largest of the regional distributors in England and Wales,
signed a five-year agreement with PowerGen, one of the two leading
generators, to take 21 terawatt (billion kilowatt) hours of electricity. The
deal, worth more than Pounds 100m a year, equates to 8m tonnes of coal.
The contract takes effect from March 31 when all British Coal's current coal
contracts are due to expire. The energy review by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade secretary, has thrown negotiations into uncertainty.
Dr James Smith, Eastern's chairman and chief executive, said the deal was
flexible enough to cope with changes in energy or regulatory policy.
He added: 'We also believe that it does not prejudice the outcome of the
current energy review but in fact helps break the deadlock in electricity
contracts and is a positive move towards securing the future of coal.'
Dr Smith preferred the certainty of a five-year deal to the one-year deals
which both Mr Heseltine and Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity
regulator, have indicated might be more appropriate until the review is
complete.
The deal would meet about 17 per cent of Eastern's needs over the period. Dr
Smith hoped to sign a similar deal with National Power, the other large
generator, by Christmas.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, said he expected to complete
deals with other regional elewctricity companies. Although he doubted
whether they would be done by Christmas.
Neither company was prepared to discuss the deal in detail, but it is
understood to be based on the price of 3.26p a unit, which has been on offer
since the coal negotiations started several months ago.
The deal excludes Eastern from paying 'uplift' - the variable charge added
to bulk electricity to finance the running of the electricity system.
Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, said the deal would bring
much-needed stability to the coal market. He hoped other regional companies
would sign five-year deals to give British Coal the breathing space it
needed to make its operations more efficient.
Other regional companies gave a mixed response. One said it would sign
nothing until the review was completed, although another indicated that it
might be ready to sign by mid January.
Mr Jim Keohane, power purchasing manager of East Midlands, said his company
was keen to see a five-year deal, although none was imminent. It was working
with other regional companies and was in active discussions with the
generators.

FT  15 DEC 92 / W Midlands manufacturers' orders continue to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING conditions for West Midlands engineering companies, whose experience
acts as a barometer for the UK manufacturing sector, continued to
deteriorate in the three months to November, with a growing proportion of
companies reporting a decline in domestic and export orders.
The quarterly business survey of the Engineering Employers' Federation West
Midlands, covering 475 companies, showed that the percentage of companies
reporting lower domestic orders rose to 51 in November from 36 in August.
Those reporting lower export orders rose to 31 per cent from 26 per cent.
The Autumn Statement and its associated interest rate cut came too late in
the November quarter to affect the immediate commercial prospects of
companies covered in the survey. Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the
EEF West Midlands, noted that 'the next two quarters will provide critical
evidence of the future direction of the UK economy'.
But the shift in the government's economic policy failed to ignite
commercial confidence. The proportion of companies cutting capital
investment was 24 per cent, scarcely changed from August.
Nearly half of the engineering companies reported that utilisation of
capacity and profits were both lower at the end of November, compared with
33 per cent at the end of August. Companies expecting capacity utilisation
to decline in the next three months rose to 28 per cent from 21 per cent
three months ago.
That points to a further reduction in jobs and 32 per cent of companies are
expecting a cut in the number of their employees over the next three months.
Only 10 per cent of companies intend to take on more people, the lowest
proportion recorded this year by the federation.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Teletext games to stimulate audience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNIQUES used to raise newspaper circulation, including cash prize games,
will be applied to stimulate interest in teletext from the beginning of next
year.
The first signs of a shake-up in the teletext service on ITV and Channel 4
will come just after midnight on January 1 when Teletext, a company in which
Associated Newspapers has a 45 per cent stake, takes over from Oracle.
Earlier this year Associated, with partners Philips Electronics and Media
Ventures, won the teletext franchise with a bid of Pounds 8.2m a year
compared with Oracle's Pounds 6.6m in one of the more obscure tenders for
commercial broadcasting licences.
They have since bought the right to use the generic name teletext as the
name of the service.
More than 10m homes have television sets that can receive teletext - the
text information service - but only a third of them regularly use it.
Papers such as the Daily Mail will carry game cards which will also be
available at newsagents. Results of games with prizes of up to Pounds 1,000
a day will be broadcast on Teletext. There will be free games for children
and others played using premium rate telephone calls.
Sir David English, chairman of Teletext, said: 'We think we can do better
than Oracle. We don't think they were very imaginative in either their
marketing or their journalism.'
It plans to change the balance of its service throughout each 24-hour
period, with pages devoted to mothers and children during the afternoon,
family entertainment during the evening and more adult- oriented pages late
at night.
For the first time, there will be a separate news service for each of the 14
ITV regions.
The basic news service from the Press Association will be supplemented by
journalists from the Mail group, owned by Associated Newspapers, and local
correspondents.
Sir David said teletext advertisers had signed up at rates 25 per cent to 30
per cent higher than that achieved by Oracle.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Process plant contractor sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUMPHREYS &amp; Glasgow, the venerable but loss-making UK process plant
contractor, is changing hands in a deal that switches ownership from
Dallas-based Enserch Corporation to Jacobs Engineering Group of Pasadena.
The sale, for which terms were not disclosed, comes in the centenary year of
H&amp;G, which was founded by two American-trained engineers, Dr Alexander
Humphreys and Dr Arthur Glasgow, to tackle the carburetted water gas
business in Europe.
Since 1892 H&amp;G has developed a worldwide reputation for its process-plant
contracting skills with expertise in industries ranging from refining to
pharmaceuticals and power generation.
Financially, it has been less successful. As a private company run for more
than 40 years by Mr Ambrose Congreve, Dr Glasgow's son-in-law, it struggled
in the 1970s against increasing competition and dwindling orders, and was
purchased by Enserch in 1983.
Terms were never disclosed - Mr Congreve said at the time: 'I always
understood a gentleman never asked the price' - but were believed to be
about Pounds 10m.
Yesterday Enserch said H&amp;G had been losing money for some years and 'the
strategic fit that we saw 10 years ago does not exist today'. Mr Frank
Edwards, former managing director, says in a book to mark the H&amp;G centenary
that the company was not able to take advantage of the process plant boom in
the late 1980s and did not have a large order backlog to cushion it through
the recession.
H&amp;G's offshore business, employing 650 to 700 people, was sold in February
to Kvaerner of Norway. Jacobs is acquiring the remaining process contracting
business, a 50 per cent stake in a successful new joint venture with Anglian
Water, and a 40 per cent stake in Bombay-based H&amp;G Consultants.
Mr Robert Clement, vice-president of marketing services at Jacobs, said it
had been searching for a long time for the right company to expand its
presence in Europe.
'This is an excellent opportunity to shape and mould H&amp;G into a winning
organisation,' he said. 'Our perception is that the losses are manageable.'

FT  15 DEC 92 / Engineering Council fires salvo in debate on reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENGINEERING Council, the umbrella body for the UK's 44 professional
engineering institutions, yesterday entered the debate about the future of
the profession yesterday by rejecting proposals from the presidents of four
big institutions.
The council was making its first statement on a debate initiated in January
by Sir John Fairclough, its chairman, which might lead to a new single body
that would replace the council and unite the engineering profession.
The proposals, now nearing the end of a year-long consultation process, have
caused intense controversy among Britain's 290,000 professional engineers
and technicians, and the institutions that represent them.
The institutions are wary of handing over too much power to the new body,
while many individual engineers say the reforms need to be more radical to
improve the image of engineers.
Last month the presidents of the instututions covering civil, mechanical,
electrical and chemical engineering said the new body must provide
leadership and vision, speak for the profession on strategic issues and
ensure that engineering's contribution to society is recognised.
They added that it 'must establish an effective partnership with the
institutions and be accountable to the community of engineers'.
Yesterday the council agreed with the presidents on the need for leadership
and vision, but disagreed on how to achieve it.
For the new body to be powerful, it said, would involve the transfer of
'significant power' from the institutions to the new body.
The body, it said, 'would need to have direct control of its subordinate
organisation, and this therefore will necessarily exclude concepts of equal
partnership'.
The council also rejected the idea that membership of the new body's council
should be confined to the institutions on a numerical basis.
That, it said, would turn the council into the 'creature of the institutions
and would sideline the interests of industry, education and the desire of
engineers on the council's register to have some form of representation'.
The salvo from the council highlights the difficulties for Sir John and the
unification steering group he chairs in reconciling different views on the
future of the profession. The steering group issued a consultative document
in August and an interim report is expected by March.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Greenway makes name as a parliamentary sketchwriters'
delight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Harry Greenway has made his name at Westminster as a parliamentary
sketchwriters' delight - never stumped for words and supporting a
bewildering variety of causes, Alison Smith writes.
A regular participant in the questions to ministers that open each day's
proceedings, he has achieved heights of publicity that his greyer colleagues
must envy.
While some of his causes are populist - such as his long-standing concern on
animal welfare - he is not above speaking his mind on more local issues.
Memorably he asked for rice pudding to be served more often in the House of
Commons cafeteria and complained about the price of humbugs in the Commons
kiosk.
A devotee of Mrs Thatcher, in March 1989 he tabled a Commons motion
congratulating her on becoming a grandmother.
Before entering politics Mr Greenway was a deputy headmaster at a school in
south London, and education has remained one of his specialist areas, with
religion and the arts.
Until the April election he was a member of the cross-party education
committee. He now serves on the employment select committee.
He has been MP for Ealing North since 1979, increasing his majority from
just over 1,000 when he was first elected to 15,000 in 1987, although in
April this year it slipped back to just under 6,000.

workforce.
Ford said it would set out its view of future prospects after reviewing the

The company is understood to be preparing a series of further restructuring

However, a planned union ballot at Ford's plants for industrial action

FT  15 DEC 92 / Lamont optimistic about recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has expressed optimism that next year
would be one of progress for the economy. But yesterday he faced a call for
a more balanced economic policy over the medium term and further supply-side
measures to increase Britain's growth potential, Emma Tucker and Ralph
Atkins write.
Mr Lamont writes in The House Magazine, the Commons publication, that the
scene is set for recovery and growth. The right environment is in place for
a restoration of confidence.
He admits that recovery has failed to take root so far, but adds: 'In
Britain we face a growing threat to activity from the slowdown in the world
economy. At the same time, the risks from inflation are diminishing. That is
why the balance of macroeconomic policy overall has been tilted to give more
weight to growth.'
However, in its latest journal, the Society of Business Economists
criticises economic management in the 1980s for relying on single policy
measures rather than on a balanced and consistent economic package.
Although the decade saw some supply-side improvements in the economy, other
difficulties were ignored, including the weakening of the manufacturing base
and the tendency to use too many resources for consumption rather than
investment, it says.
Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI, writes: 'The UK needs a
strategic vision which is capable of changing attitudes throughout society
about the economy's performance and particularly attitudes to manufacturing
industry. . . It has to include a realistic commitment to Europe and certain
institutional changes.'
Sir Peter Walters, the chairman of Midland Bank, today becomes the first of
the clearing bank chairmen to meet Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to
discuss the government's review of banks' interest rate policy.

FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Anti-cartel penalties tightened by Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government has toughened the criminal penalties for the
formation of cartels, following pressure from the US and recommendations
from the Fair Trade Commission, the country's anti-monopoly body.
Meanwhile, a separate advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (Miti) yesterday recommended that the government increase
protection for intellectual property rights by toughening fines and
redefining products eligible for protection.
Japanese anti-monopoly legislation had made no distinction between a cartel
violation by an individual and a company, and had kept fines for the two at
the same level. But an amendment to the legislation provides for a
distinction and for far tougher penalties on companies.
Under the new legislation, Japanese companies violating the criminal
provisions of the law will be subject to a maximum fine of Y100m (Pounds
526,000), up from Y5m.
The changes follow demands made by the US government at the bilateral
Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks.

FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Rice farmers in Japan stage a ritual
protest - A basic problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE rice farmers plan to take to the streets of Tokyo today, in an
orderly formation of 50 tractors, to make a carefully choreographed protest
against the government's hints that the closed rice market must inevitably
be opened to imports.
This follows a promise of 'flexibility' by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, who has heralded, albeit through understatement, a new phase of
debate on the most awkward issue confronting Japan in the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations.
His apparent acceptance that a rice market opening is necessary provides a
focus for the protesting farmers, many quietly resigned to the idea but
still pressing loudly for generous compensation.
'We have to say we are opposed to imports, but there doesn't seem to be any
way of stopping them,' lamented an official from a branch in Kumamoto of the
Central Union of Agricultural Co-operatives, which organised the tractor
protest and has invited a French farmers' representative to witness how it
is done the Japanese way.
A 26-year-old farmer in the same region of southern Japan complained that
the quality of local rice is 'clearly higher' than the foreign product, but
he and other producers may lose out 'because modern Japanese cannot tell the
difference between good rice and bad rice'. There is still high emotion in
some paddy fields, but part of that anger is directed against the country's
manufacturers, whose 'excessive' exports are seen as a cause of
international demands for a rice market opening.
Protests will continue during the final stages of a debate which appeared to
be settled two years ago, when the ruling Liberal Democratic party and
farmers' representatives informally agreed that rice imports would
inevitably be part of a Uruguay Round settlement.
The script for the political theatre in Japan provides for the EC and US to
settle their disagreement over agricultural trade, placing Japan at the
centre of the negotiations and allowing the government to say it has
defended farmers' interests in the face of international pressure.
It may not happen until early next year, but Mr Miyazawa and his new cabinet
are coming to terms with the responsibility of taking a decision on rice. Mr
Koko Sato, chairman of the LDP's executive council, also suggested yesterday
that the government must be 'flexible' on rice tariffication - the
replacement of the existing ban with tariffs, supposed to be reduced
gradually over coming years. He indicated that the agriculture ministry has
already begun research on extra support for Japanese farmers.
As Mr Sato suggests, there are two unsettled issues, the rate of tariffs and
the compensation for farmers. Japanese officials have suggested that a
tariff rate of 700 per cent may be high enough to keep out most of the
foreign competition, particularly rice from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and
the US. But agriculture ministry officials insist that a special case must
be made for rice and that the rate of tariff reduction must be minimal. They
say that if rice is written into an international tariff schedule, ministry
and farmers will lose control over the rate of decrease and the accompanying
increase in imports.
The ministry calculates that the foreign share can be restricted to between
5 and 7 per cent of the 10m-tonne Japanese market, prompting a similar
reduction in the country's 2.5m hectares of rice fields. On that basis, the
next figure to be negotiated is the rate of compensation.
Japan already has a rice crop reduction scheme, and farmers are receiving
incentives to convert paddy fields to melon or tobacco fields. Farmers are
also likely to receive extra funds to advertise the homegrown product and
their agricultural co-operatives are certain to get extra handouts for
everything from vehicles to seminars on pest eradication.

ALLSTATE Insurance Company, one of the biggest car insurers in the US and
part of the Sears, Roebuck retail and financial services group, has agreed
to suspend its threatened withdrawal from New Jersey for two years.
The company claimed yesterday that the decision reflected 'a better
relationship' with the state's insurance authorities and the governor's
office.
It also reflected 'renewed hope' that the insurance climate in New Jersey
was becoming less hostile.
Allstate, which is the largest provider of car insurance in New Jersey,
stunned the insurance industry in September 1991.
It announced then that it was seeking regulatory approval to stop writing
virtually all types of coverage in the state. The company blamed years of
losses from its core car insurance operation, and its move was seen as a
direct challenge to New Jersey's governor Jim Florio.
Governor Florio has been strongly sympathetic to consumerist demands,
calling for lower insurance premiums and reform of New Jersey's insurance
laws.
Although insurers have pulled out of certain lines of business in individual
states in the past, Allstate's move threatened to have particularly large
repercussions. It could have affected insurance coverage for around 400,000
cars and 250,000 residences.
Over the weekend, however, the Chicago-based insurer reached a settlement
with the Florio administration, under which Allstate will be permitted to
raise rates modestly and the withdrawal will be suspended.
Aside from a more genial atmosphere, Allstate said that its decision was
influenced by some specific court rulings in New Jersey, certain legislative
action, and a willingness on the part of the authorities to develop a
low-cost car insurance policy.

URUGUAYANS blocked President Luis Alberto Lacalle's most ambitious
privatisation projects by an overwhelming majority in a referendum on
Sunday, according to yesterday's official results, writes Our Correspondent
in Montevideo.
The official count showed that 71.2 per cent of the 2m electoratehad voted
against five articles of Uruguay's public sector companies law. The law was
passed in March but the president was forced by opposition pressure to call
the referendum.
The vote will prevent the government selling off 51 per cent of the Antel
Telephone Company to foreign and local investors. Mr Lacalle's Blanco party
administration had hoped to raise Dollars 500m by entrusting the profitable
but overmanned Antel to a foreign operator.
It had even picked seven telecommunication companies for a tender to find a
partner for Antel.
The president, a conservative who before the referendum had refused to
consider other formulas for Antel's privatisation, seemed undeterred. In a
televised message he said he would seek agreements with the opposition,
insisting that he intended to push ahead with reforms in the two years left
of his five-year tenure.
Opposition politicians, however, saw the referendum vote as a victory, with
voters crossing party lines over an issue that has pitted free market
supporters against nationalists of all hues.
Former President Julio Maria Santuinetti, a leader of the Colorado party,
who criticised Mr Lacalle's privatisation plans, said the referendum proved
that his own party and the left-wing Frente Amplio coalition were now the
dominant forces in Uruguayan politics.
Senator Alberto Zumaran, a rebel of Mr Lacalle's party who sided with the
president's critics, called for a reform of Uruguay's winner-take-all
electoral laws. 'Party lines were torn apart. There were factions on each
side of the issue, especially among traditional parties. The referendum was
the straw that broke the camel's back,' he said.
The PIT-CNT labour leaders who spearheaded the campaign against Mr Lacalle's
plan said the vote was a clear rejection of the government's unpopular
economic policies.
However, the financial daily, El Observador said that people had simply
postponed the painful need to overhaul the state by rejecting Mr Lacalle's
timid privatisation plan.
Mr Lacalle has floated the public sector's deficit and eased inflation down
to 60 per cent from over 100 per cent. But his policy of keeping public
sector pay increases below inflation, coupled with plans to reduce the state
presence in the economy, has caused innumerable strikes and widespread
discontent. One in 10 Uruguayan adults work for the state.
Mr Lacalle also ran into trouble last month when he granted the armed and
security forces substantial awards after policemen staged a four-day strike
and military officers demanded higher wages.
Urugay's central bank officials acknowledged that those pay rises would
spark more problems.

FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: US poses new Gatt quandary - Washington
and environmentalists have objected to proposals for a new trade
organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TIDY-MINDED after-thought to the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
talks has become yet another obstacle to completion of the stuttering
six-year-old negotiations.
US objections to proposals for a powerful new trade institution to implement
the Round's results are set against the backdrop of an aggressive campaign
against the provisionally named Multilateral Trade Organisation by
environmental groups, especially in the US where a final Uruguay Round
package, due next February, faces a rough ride through Congress.
US officials last week infuriated trading partners in Geneva by suggesting
that the MTO could be ditched, leaving the present General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade to administer the 28 or so Uruguay Round accords spanning
virtually all world trade in goods, services and ideas (intellectual
property such as patents, copyrights and trademarks).
After 45 years Gatt is still only a provisional contractual arrangement,
after refusal by the US Congress in 1948 to ratify the International Trade
Organisation, its legal parent. The MTO, first mooted by Canada and the
European Community in 1990, would give the agreements the status of
international law and concrete form to the idea of the Round as a 'single
undertaking' - to which all 108 participants must subscribe in its entirety.
It would subsume Gatt itself, proposed sister bodies on services and
intellectual property, and the now voluntary Gatt codes on anti-dumping,
technical barriers to trade and so on. It would operate a common dispute
settlement mechanism with the possibility of 'cross-retaliation' between
sectors.
US officials deny they are deliberately throwing a spanner in the works and
say trading partners were alerted months ago that Washington had problems
with the MTO draft text. 'We're not closing the door on an MTO,' says a
senior official. 'But we have to negotiate changes.' Washington's main
worries relate not to the MTO's status as an international treaty, as some
have suggested, but to draft rules that override existing Gatt obligations
or alter deals negotiated in the Round.
These concern voting procedures on amendments to international trade rules -
which, unlike existing Gatt rules, would oblige dissenting countries to
accept changes approved by a two-thirds majority - and the rights of
countries to waive agreed rules or withhold their benefits from trading
partners ('non-application'). Thus the draft agreement on intellectual
property does not permit countries to opt out of its provisions. The draft
MTO text does.
US officials say if other countries are unwilling to renegotiate the MTO
rules it would still be possible to implement the Uruguay Round as a 'single
undertaking', including an integrated dispute settlement mechanism, by means
of a ministerial declaration and accompanying protocol.
Environmentalists, for their part, argue that a powerful MTO, its policies
formulated by trade bureaucrats behind closed doors, will trample on
government efforts to protect the environment and promote sustainable
development, by giving priority to unconstrained free trade. They fear,
among other things, that it will force a 'levelling down' of environmental,
consumer and safety standards by making it easier to challenge high
standards as barriers to trade.
US negotiators say they are seeking 'clarifications' to draft rules on food
safety regulations and technical standards that would endorse the right of
governments to set standards above international norms. Some European
governments support this. However, this alone is unlikely to placate the
environment lobby which wants a wholesale 'greening' of the MTO text
including a commitment to sustainable development.
Another MTO problem concerns membership. Nearly 40 small developing
countries which have not taken a full part in the Geneva negotiations could
find themselves excluded because they have not made offers to liberalise
trade in goods and services.
Worse, Brussels is pondering whether the EC rather than member states should
become a member of the MTO. At present, it speaks in Gatt on behalf of
members, which are individual contracting parties. However, the EC does not
run a common regime on trade in services as it does for goods - so it is
open to dispute whether it can speak on behalf of member states in services.

THE US Supreme Court has agreed to review a court ruling that could close
one of the loopholes through which banks can gain access to the insurance
market.
The Court said yesterday that it would take up a case brought by the
Independent Insurance Agents Association against the National Bank of
Oregon, contesting banks' right under a 1916 law to sell insurance policies
in towns of fewer than 5,000 people.
This limited loophole was widened in 1986 when the Comptroller of the
Currency, who supervises nationally chartered banks, decided that a bank
could expand its insurance sales from its small town base to other markets.
A federal appeals court in February not only dismissed this decision, but
ruled the entire section justifying it was repealed in 1918 as a result of a
congressional drafting error.
The Oregon bank has been selling policies to its customers nationwide from
the small town of Banks. The administration's efforts to allow banks broader
rights to sell insurance and other financial services failed in Congress
last year.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Trial shines light into dark Mexican corners: Drug case puts
political system in dock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO is accustomed to being portrayed by the US as corrupt and violent,
but rarely can the charges have been as serious as those levelled last week
during the trial of Dr Humberto Alvarez Machain. The Mexican doctor is
accused by US federal prosecutors of aiding the 1985 murder and torture of a
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) official, Mr Enrique Camarena.
According to two witnesses called by the US government, Mexico's then
interior minister, governor of Jalisco and defence minister were all in the
pay of the Guadalajara drug cartel. The witnesses also claimed that the
ministers and governor were present at meetings in which Mr Camarena's
murder was planned and visited the house where Mr Camarena was held on the
day he was killed.
In the view of the Mexican government - already furious at the kidnapping by
the DEA of Dr Alvarez Machain from Mexico, which enabled the trial to go
ahead - the charges are 'based on the testimony of delinquents and criminals
who do not merit credibility in light of their personal history'.
Such an opinion has gained some sympathy in Mexico. The witnesses are
convicted criminals, who have been offered immunity (and money) by the US
government to testify and may convince the Los Angeles judge presiding over
the trial. He was expected to decide yesterday afternoon whether to dismiss
the case against Dr Alvarez Machain for lack of evidence.
But to critics of Mexico's political system, the charges are an indictment
of the state that has enabled the implicated officials to rise to such
important positions. The two government ministers accused in the trial are
not only quintessential products of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, but also close colleagues of former President Miguel de
la Madrid and current President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
Mr Manuel Bartlett, the interior minister at the time of the Camarena
murder, has worked in the Finance, Budget, and Foreign ministries, was
education minister until earlier this year. He has just been elected
governor of Puebla state. At one point he was favoured to succeed Mr de la
Madrid as president. Mr Enrique Alvarez de Castillo has been governor of
Jalisco, attorney-general, and is now the director of the state bank,
Banobras, while Gen Juan Arevalo Dardoqui, the former defence minister, is a
career army man.
For the Mexican government, allegations against such senior officials could
not have come at a worse time. It is now trying to build ties with Mr Bill
Clinton's incoming administration and convince the US public that Mexico is
a worthy member of the proposed North American free trade area. The
description of the torture of Mr Camarena by Mexican police, drug
traffickers and possibly senior government officials, in retribution for his
success as a DEA agent, will have done little to help that cause.
The accusations, whether true or not, are also likely to draw attention to
the greatest flaw in the Mexican state: corruption in the legal and
political system - hardly touched by President Salinas's economic reforms.
In practically all the big drug scandals over the past decade, be it the
murder of Mr Camarena, the prison riot between rival drug gangs at Matamoros
last year, or the shoot-out between the army and police in Veracruz this
year, police, army or government officials have been implicated in narcotics
trafficking.
The police are also largely responsible for Mexico's dismal human rights
record, another issue likely to be raised by the US Congress when
considering the free trade agreement. As Mr Jorge Carpizo, president of the
government's human rights commission, put it: 'Police officers who engage in
torture are neither sadists nor deranged. . . . They know that in most
cases, even when they exceed themselves to the point of homicide, they will
not be punished because their chiefs will defend or cover up for them.'
Mexico's politicians in turn are protected not just by a malleable police
force and legal system, but by television and most newspapers, which try not
to embarrass senior government officials. The owner and publisher of the
Mexico City News, Mexico's English-language daily, blocked unflattering
articles on Mr Bartlett in the run-up to the Puebla election earlier this
year.
In a similar vein, the investigative weekly, Proceso, claims state officials
working for Mr Bartlett tried to buy up all Puebla copies of the December 6
edition, which featured charges against Mr Bartlett on the front cover, in a
futile attempt to prevent the magazine falling into the hands of the public.

THE Italian quality steel maker, Lucchini, has said it will be 'cautious'
about expanding sales into European Community countries from its new joint
venture with the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw.
Mr Luigi Lucchini, head of the company, who was in Warsaw yesterday to cap
two years of negotiations, said the new company Huta L W had the Polish
domestic market to concentrate on, while exports were needed to service the
project's foreign currency debts.
Under the joint venture, the first foreign investment in Poland's steel
industry, Lucchini has obtained 51 per cent of the mill's equity and is
committed to a Dollars 200m modernisation plan over 18 months. The joint
venture is capitalised at Ecu53.4m (Pounds 43.2m).
The balance of the shares is held by the mill's Polish creditor banks led by
Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which is soon to be privatised and now holds
21.8 per cent through a debt for equity swap. Lucchini's modernisation plan
foresees annual output of 600,000 tonnes of quality steel.

Lawyers for the Bush administration have backed the bank's appeal against
the appeals court ruling.
The Oregon bank has been selling policies to its customers nationwide from
the small town of Banks, and about 100 banks have also taken advantage of
the loophole.
The administration's efforts to allow banks much broader rights to sell
insurance and other financial services failed in Congress last year.
However, the Supreme Court last year refused to review another ruling - in
this case, in favour of the banks - on a Delaware state law permitting banks
to sell insurance policies through locally chartered subsidiaries.
Banks have been excluded from activities such as stockbroking, securities
underwriting and insurance by legislation from the 1920s and 1930s. After
the 1991 attempt at broader legislative reform failed, they have placed most
of their hopes for expanded powers to sell a full range of financial
services on piecemeal decisions by regulators.

ISRAELI prime minister Mr Yitzhak Rabin last night demanded evidence that an
Israeli paramilitary policeman kidnapped by Palestinian Islamic
fundamentalists was alive before he would consider releasing their jailed
leader.
He denied he was prepared to negotiate over the kidnappers' demands. But he
said in a television interview the government must be shown 'signs of life'
as a precondition for any talks on the matter.
Mr Rabin said Israeli security forces were pursuing every means of finding
the border policeman, Sgt-Maj Nissim Toledano. The man was abducted while
walking to work early on Sunday in the central Israeli city of Lod. He was
taken by Qassam, the military wing of the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist
movement from the occupied territories.
The authorities sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, placed hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians under curfew and arrested dozens of Hamas
supporters. All police leave was cancelled and helicopters were brought in
to the search operation.
Mr Rabin said no direct contact had been made by last night with the
kidnappers, who were demanding the release of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the
crippled Hamas leader who was jailed for life last year on charges of
ordering the killing of Palestinian collaborators.
The prime minister said the Islamic movement was seeking to destroy the
Middle East peace negotiations in Washington and warned Israelis to expect
more attacks as the talks continued. But he reiterated his strong commitment
to the peace process. 'We will not be deterred by kidnappings and
shootings,' he said.
Senior figures in Gaza linked with Hamas suggested 57-year-old Sheikh Yassin
could be freed on medical grounds - he is disabled and in poor health. But
releasing him would be seen both by Hamas and by Israel's right-wing
opposition as a sign of weakness in Mr Rabin.

The move was aimed at showing the determination of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade surplus last month rose by 18.5 per cent to Dollars 7.6bn
largely as a result of a sharp fall in imports, according to figures
published yesterday by the Finance Ministry.
Senior officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said
they are ready to open discussions with the incoming Clinton administration
in the US on a new approach to trade frictions to replace the Structural
Impediments Initiative, which was launched in 1989.
Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, director general of the ministry's international trade
policy bureau said: 'We are ready to discuss changing the SII forum for
discussing structural trade issues, particularly if a new forum included a
wider group of academics and business people to analyse the situation.'
Exports last month were virtually stagnant, rising by just 0.7 per cent to
Dollars 27.2bn from a year before. The growth in the surplus was mainly
because of a 4.8 per cent fall in imports to Dollars 19.7bn.
In yen terms exports fell 5.1 per cent to Y3,351bn, while imports were down
10.5 per cent to Y2,414bn.
The slowdown in the Japanese economy is continuing to take a heavy toll in
corporate bankruptcies, according to a report published yesterday by the
Teikoku Data Bank, a research agency.
Bankruptcies with debts of more than Y10m last month were 15.7 per cent up
on last year, with bankruptcies in manufacturing up by 47 per cent and
retail bankruptcies up by 29.7 per cent.

FT  15 DEC 92 / S Korean economy faces a rejig / A look at politicians'
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and JACK BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S well-entrenched bureaucrats might pale at Mr Chung Ju-yung's
vision of the finance ministry as a kind of policy research institute, to
which he would grant 'a role in formulating the budget and monetary policy'.
Under his approach, the powerful Economic Planning Board could also expect
its days to be numbered.
The founder of the Hyundai industrial conglomerate, who is standing for
president in elections on Friday, has won nationwide support through his
brash promises of smaller government, open markets, lower borrowing rates
and trebled per capita income in five years.
Yet Mr Chung is simply expressing the most extreme version of what is
recognised by the two more established candidates, Mr Kim Young-sam and Mr
Kim Dae-jung, as a transformation vital for Korea's economic progress.
It is generally recognised that Korea has to loosen bureaucratic shackles on
the economy, open up financial markets, and improve productivity and
technology if it is to sustain its growth. Though the economy has expanded
by an average of 8 per cent a year in the five years of Mr Roh Tae-woo's
presidency, a fall to a 3.1 per cent annual rate in the third quarter caused
widespread alarm. Mr Roh's economic leadership is dismissed as weak by most
politicians.
Mr Suh Sang-mok, an economic adviser to Mr Kim Young-sam, the ruling party
candidate, says: 'Korea has a bicycle economy - if the speed is too slow,
you fall off.' The top priority, he says, is improving the international
competitiveness of Korean industry, which has sagged as a result of labour
unrest and rising wages.
The platforms of all three candidates reflect the belief that five-year
plans and direct government control of the economy, with bureaucratic
sanction needed for most important corporate decisions, are no longer
suitable given Korea's advanced stage of economic development and democratic
freedom.
Mr Park Jae-yoon, another adviser to Mr Kim Young-sam, says: 'We believed
implicitly that the economy could grow by itself along the previous
development path. But that was wrong. So now we have to change the nature of
the economy.'
Mr Yoo Jong-keun, an adviser to Mr Kim Dae-jung, the leading opposition
candidate, says: 'If we want full commitment to democracy, then we have to
have a full commitment to the free market system.'
The candidates plan reform in several key areas:
Financial liberalisation. Tightly controlled interest rates, credit
allocation, and curbs on capital flows create distortions - for example,
deposit rates are artificially low and borrowing costs artificially high,
especially for smaller companies. All candidates would accelerate the
current official timetable, under which significant financial reforms are
postponed in 1997. Mr Chung would free all interest rates immediately, while
Mr Kim Young-sam is likely to be more wary of causing disruption through
rapid reform.
Chaebol reform. The family-owned industrial conglomerates dominate the
economy at the expense of smaller companies and have prospered through
subsidised loans.
Mr Roh's attempts to use credit controls and to encourage them to focus on a
few core businesses have produced few results. All candidates aim instead to
fragment the chaebol by strict application of inheritance tax, encouraging
owners to sell some of their holdings on the stock market; and by enforcing
anti-trust laws.
Mr Chung takes the most radical approach, promising to dissolve the chaebol
 -he is setting an example with plans to distribute Hyundai group companies
among his six sons.
Banking reform. All candidates would cease government appointments of
private sector bank chairmen and top executives. Government-mandated low
interest loans to sectors officially deemed strategically important, from
agriculture to high-technology industry, would be gradually phased out.
Slimmer bureaucracy. As part of a drive to make the economy more market-led,
Finance Ministry powers would be curbed. All candidates promise to study the
role of the Economic Planning Board, which once directed the economy through
five-year plans. Industrial competitiveness. Inadequate spending on research
and development have hampered Korea's progress towards higher-technology
industry which would keep it ahead of other rapidly developing countries.
The candidates would, through tax incentives, raise total Korean research
and development spending from 3 per cent to 5 per cent of gross domestic
product. Financial disclosure. All candidates favour 'real-name' accounting,
which would prevent concealment of financial assets. This would raise tax
revenues, but could cause liquidity problems in financial markets.
Laudable though these plans may be, seasoned economists are sceptical about
the candidates' commitment to them and about their timing. Korea's regulated
economy gives officials great power.
Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of Daewoo Research Institute, says: 'Since 1975
the government has said it wants to deregulate and have a private sector-led
economy. But actually more and more regulations have accumulated.'
However, the challenge for the next president will be to push through
economic reform. If he does not, Korea's progress up the league of
industrial nations will be at risk.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Soldiers bring security to the Somalia aid effort: Relief
agencies have fewer doubts about US-led intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN aid agencies who have fought a battle to deliver food and medicine
to Somalia's starving millions have greeted the US-led military intervention
with relief and optimism.
In Mogadishu gunmen and their battle wagons have virtually disappeared from
the streets and the relief gateways of the port and airport are secure and
operating at full capacity for the first time in two years.
Even the most sceptical aid agencies, such as Britain's Save the Children
Fund which opposed the US operation at the beginning, have cautiously
welcomed the multinational force building up in Mogadishu with a United
Nations mandate to protect the delivery of relief supplies.
Concern is growing about the slow movement of the military into the
starvation-ridden interior, and reservations about the long-term commitment
of the US-led task force remain among many experienced aid officials. But in
the six days since US Marines first landed in Mogadishu, aid workers have
begun to feel that they can now do their job without fearing for their lives
or being held hostage to extortion, intimidation and the threat of looting.
Fears among some agencies that expatriate aid workers would be made targets
by resentful Somalis suddenly put out of a lucrative protection racket have
so far proved unfounded.
'We have seen some security benefits,' said Mr Don Redding, Save the
Children spokesman. 'But we are not yet satisfied there's sufficient
thinking about long-term development and the involvement of Somalis in
reconstruction.'
Others such as the international relief and development agency CARE and the
UN World Food Programme, which were strong although belated advocates of
military intervention, are more optimistic.
'We have always had the capacity and food pipeline to feed Somalia within
weeks,' said Mr Paul Mitchell of WFP. 'Now the security situation is ten
times better already and we are getting the operation moving swiftly. Food
is already moving through the port and city with the help of the marines.'
Turmoil, violence and looting had overtaken Somalia by early last year. Many
Somalis feared that each food shipment would be the last and in the scramble
for scarce resources armed robbery, diversion of food convoys and shoot-outs
over food became the norm. Merchants and warlords cashed in on the relief
business, hiring out bandits turned guards and armoured battle wagons to
agencies desperate for protection and then paying gunmen to loot relief
supplies they were paid to protect.
The airport was repeatedly closed and re-opened as the clan-faction which
nominally controlled it massively increased its fees and occasionally fought
gun-battles with rival clans.
At the port relief ships were looted in the harbour. Port security guards,
supplied by one warlord, had to be paid off with large amounts of food and
in money to get relief trucks moving out of the port. Once the trucks left
the port gates, as much as 80 per cent were 'diverted' - a Somali euphemism
for stolen.
Movement of food into the interior, outside a handful of towns, was
impossible and at least 300,000 people have starved to death this year.
Lengthy negotiations with the warlords, first by humanitarian relief
organisations and then by UN representatives, got bogged down in the greed
of opposing groups determined to benefit more than their rivals. It took
four months for the UN to get 500 poorly armed Pakistanis into Somalia and
deployed into the airport.
Patience finally broke after two incidents. First Bardera, a town north-west
of Mogadishu, after a tussle between Somalia's two main battling warlords
was retaken by Gen Mohammed Hersi Morgan from Gen Mohammed Farrar Aideed.
Aid workers were evacuated. The death rate rocketed from under 100 a day to
307 a day at its highest. Bardera proved that relief efforts were futile
without vastly improved and long-term security.
Weeks later, on November 24, a WFP-chartered ship with 10,000 tonnes of
wheat was shelled as it tried to dock in the port ,and turned back.
'These incidents finally demonstrated what we had been arguing for since
November of last year,' said Dr Willy Huber of SOS Kinderdorf, which drew up
a plan for military intervention at that time and tried unsuccessfully to
seek other agency support for the scheme. 'Since 1991 all efforts to
distribute food were a waste of time, energy and resources without security
backed by massive force.'
The US-led force in Somalia are still trying to find their feet and learn
how to deal with an armed population who have lost respect for authority and
their starving fellow people. Concern is growing among aid workers about US
statements that Washington wants to withdraw its forces by late January and
hand over to the UN, which is thoroughly discredited in Somalia.
'I am not in favour of military intervention but it had to happen,' said Dr
Dominique Martin of Medecins Sans Frontieres. 'But it is the transition from
the US to the UN which really worries me and how they will handle to gunmen
and the clans which are losing out. It could still fall apart if they don't
handle it right and then we will be back to square one.'

FT  15 DEC 92 / Harsh challenge for both Israel and PLOST: The armed tactics
of an Islamic militant movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEEKEND kidnapping of an Israeli soldier has underlined not just the
strength of Islamic fundamentalists in the occupied territories, but also
the challenge they pose both to Israel and to the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
The abduction of Sgt Major Nissim Toledano of the paramilitary Border Police
as he walked to work in the central Israeli city of Lod was accomplished
with cool efficiency by the so-called Qassam military wing of the Hamas
'Islamic Resistance Movement' on the fifth anniversary of the official
founding of Hamas.
In those five years, Hamas has grown in influence in the West Bank and,
especially, in the squalid refugee camps and towns of the Gaza Strip. It
sees itself as being in the vanguard of the intifada, the uprising against
Israeli rule which erupted in Gaza in December 1987 as Hamas came into
being.
Lately Hamas has, through Qassam, stepped up its use of firearms against
Israeli forces - as distinct from the stones and petrol bombs which
otherwise characterise intifada violence. In the last week alone, Qassam has
shot dead four soldiers, compared with 20 troops killed in the previous five
years of the uprising.
These killings and the kidnapping of Sgt Major Toledano are deeply troubling
developments for the Israeli army. Troops deployed in the West Bank and Gaza
are geared chiefly to combat street rioting - albeit frequently with deadly
live fire. They are not set up well against armed ambushes. Few of their
jeeps and trucks are bullet proofed as are those of the British forces in
Northern Ireland.
However, the political challenge of Hamas - an Arabic acronym for Islamic
Resistance Movement which also means courage - is probably more worrying for
Israel, and, ironically, also for the PLO, traditionally Israel's great
enemy.
Hamas strongly opposes the Middle East peace talks in Washington which the
PLO supports. It rejects not only the scheme of an interim period of
self-rule for the Palestinians before talks on the final status of the
territories; it rejects outright PLO acceptance of Israel's right to exist
alongside a secular, independent Palestinian state. Its ideology demands
establishment of an Islamic state in all of Palestine.
Israel originally allowed the formation of Islamic groups in Gaza in the
hope they would erode the supremacy of the PLO. But the strategy has
backfired as Hamas has waxed far stronger than the authorities imagined.
PLO supporters say Hamas still attracts only minority support. In the few
elections allowed in the West Bank and Gaza recently, such as for chambers
of commerce and student bodies, the PLO has tended to come out on top. But
in Gaza and some areas of the West Bank, support for Hamas is reckoned by
many to be around 40 per cent.
The PLO fears Hamas could do uncomfortably well if it chose to participate
in general elections proposed in the peace talks - something it has not
specifically ruled out. Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the crippled leader of Hamas
whose release from jail is sought by Sgt Major Toledano's kidnappers,
certainly believes so.
The frail, bearded Sheikh Yassin told the Financial Times in one of the last
interviews he gave before he was arrested in 1989: 'The overwhelming
majority of Palestinians are Moslems and they do not reject Islam. Even some
members of the PLO are supporters of the Islamic movement. That is why I am
confident that if there was complete freedom for voters then the Islamic
movement would win everywhere - in Gaza, the West Bank and even among
Moslems inside Israel.'

FT  15 DEC 92 / US marines prepare first deep land penetration in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOGADISHU, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Marines and army troops were preparing last night to make their first
deep land penetration of the starvation-ridden interior of Somalia, writes
Julian Ozanne in Mogadishu.
According to US military officials, marines will start a 24-hour operation
this morning to take control of Baidoa, the 'City of Death' at the centre of
Somalia's hunger zone where up to 100 people are dying each day in that town
alone.
US officials said troops would today begin moving out of Mogadishu in a
70-vehicle armoured convoy and a score of helicopters along the
bandit-plagued dirt road to Baidoa, roughly 150 miles north-west of the
capital.
By evening the road should be secured by 'Humvee' armoured cars and
Cobra-helicopter flying patrols. Special forces commandos would move into
positions around Baidoa by nightfall to prepare for an advance on the town
at dawn tomorrow. In total 600 to 700 troops, including a small contingent
of French soldiers, would be used.
In Mogadishu confusion was still apparent among US forces about their exact
role in disarming bandits, freelance gunmen and rival clan-militias. Col
Fred Peck, the marines' spokesman, said he had received no orders to disarm
Somalis and described the policy on disarmament as a 'very ambiguous
situation'.
He was speaking after Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general,
said at the weekend President George Bush had discreetly promised to disarm
the warring factions.
Michael Littlejohns adds from New York: Mr Boutros Ghali played down any
policy difference with the Americans at a news conference in New York. Given
that the UN must also be consulted before coalition troops could withdraw,
he would try to ensure there was adequate security in Somalia to enable the
world body then to begin a new peacekeeping operation and efforts at
national reconciliation.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Japan puts forward recipe for improved EC relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN and the European Community risk causing irreparable harm to their
relations unless they quickly take an historic opportunity to fashion a
political and economic partnership, according to a wide-ranging report from
the Tokyo Foreign Ministry on Japan's relations with Europe.
The report by a specially appointed group of advisers is Japan's most
comprehensive attempt yet to lay out a foreign policy framework for its
relations with the EC.
The study, which makes 90 recommendations on measures to improve relations,
is partly designed to respond to fears among some EC officials of growing
trade friction in spite of last year's joint Hague declaration on political
co-operation.
The group which compiled the report for the ministry was chaired by Mr
Teruhiko Mano, adviser to the president of the Bank of Tokyo, and included
academics and business executives. Senior Foreign Ministry officials said
the document would help to provide a framework for Japan's medium-term
approach to the EC.
It says the EC and Japan need to develop a closer relationship in part to
balance the much stronger relationships each has with the US.
It describes the EC's integration programme was an historical experiment
which should create an economically dynamic and political stable power at
the heart of Europe. It displays considerable confidence in the EC's ability
to overcome delays in the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which it
says should prove to be no more than temporary setbacks.
However, it also warns that relations with the EC have traditionally been
marked by trade frictions, which have been underpinned by misunderstandings
on both sides.
It says: 'In Europe there remains a deep rooted tendency to believe that
Europe only can set universal standards and that what is universal ought to
derive from Europe.'
Japan would have to harmonise many of its economic practices with
international standards, particularly by reducing working time.
But Japan's growing trade surplus with the EC was largely a reflection of EC
producers' relative lack of interest in penetrating Japan.
The report's main recommendation is for a series of joint study groups on
the prospects for free trade, corporate behaviour, science and the
environment and financial assistance for developing countries.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Kohl to bolster Yeltsin despite debt issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany to Moscow last night, hoping to
demonstrate his strong support for President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a
summit which is overshadowed by festering disagreement concerning
outstanding Russian debts.
The event is likely to prove diplomatically sensitive, with Mr Yeltsin in a
battle to assert his authority at home, while Mr Kohl is unable to make the
sort of financial pledges he used to give so willingly to Mr Mikhail
Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, has been forced to join in the
top-level talks, because of the failure by the two sides to resolve two key
financial questions.
The first concerns outstanding debts owed by Russia to the former East
Germany, amounting to some DM17.6bn (Pounds 7.16bn).
These debts were accumulated in transferable roubles, the internal currency
of the Comecon state-trading organisation. Germany is insisting they must be
honoured.
'These are debts owing for goods delivered by East German enterprises to
Russian enterprises, and they have simply not paid up,' a German Finance
Ministry official said yesterday.
'We recognise the enormous difficulties Russia is facing, and we are willing
to give whatever help we can in supporting the restructuring process, but we
are not prepared simply to write off the debt.'
The second issue concerns compensation payments for the facilities left
behind by Soviet troops departing from East Germany.
Mr Yeltsin has claimed anything up to DM8bn for these buildings, military
air strips and other structures.
But the German government insists they have nothing like that market value.
'We have agreed to pay the market value, but the Russians have some
difficulty understanding what that is,' an official said.
The German side says that far from having any intrinsic value, most of the
facilities will have to be demolished, and widespread environmental
pollution cleared up, at a cost running into billions of D-Marks.
In spite of months of negotiations, the two sides still appear far apart on
the amount of compensation payable.
The German side is not planning to talk in detail about Russia's request for
a comprehensive debt rescheduling, currently under negotiation with the
Paris Club of creditor governments.
'That is a matter for the Paris Club, and the only contribution we can make
is to improve the atmosphere,' the German official said.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Reform hope in balance as Russia names new PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'THE difference between a reformer not able to reform and a non-reformer who
can do some reforms may not be very great.' This evaluation from a foreign
expert in Moscow of the change in prime minister from the reforming Mr Yegor
Gaidar to the non-reforming Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin was the most positive
given yesterday.
The foreign response has so far been cautious - reflecting a view that Mr
Gaidar himself had been unable to stem the ballooning budget deficit and
inflation spiral, and that a replacement need not necessarily be worse. This
contrasts sharply with the views of Mr Gaidar's circle: one aide last night
went so far as to question whether democracy could continue. Observers and
advisers in Moscow gave a variety of reasons yesterday why Mr Gaidar's
resignation and Mr Chernomyrdin's election do not constitute a disaster for
Russia.
First, Mr Chernomyrdin knows the system, and could force closures and
restructuring of inefficient enterprises where Mr Gaidar and his
inexperienced team could not. Second, Mr Chernomyrdin's promise to deepen
reform while seeking to slow the fall in production and increase social
security is merely repeating promises made by Mr Gaidar.
Third, unless he re-establishes the command-administrative system, he faces
the same financial and other constraints Mr Gaidar faced; if he ignores
these, the financial system will collapse. Many in Moscow believe reform can
begin only after such a collapse.
Fourth, Mr Gaidar could not achieve financial stability, and under his
premiership, the rouble was heading for hyperinflation. It is better for it
to get there under someone else. Fifth, Mr Chernomyrdin is not, at 54, old
for a prime minister, but has been unwell recently, and needs constant
treatment. He has little or no popular base, and is explicitly not President
Yeltsin's choice. He does not seem to be a long-term candidate.
A possible sixth reason is that it is simply not clear why Mr Gaidar went.
His advisers were saying this weekend they were prepared for him to be
replaced as prime minister, but that he would stay as head of economic
reform. Mr Yeltsin was clear that he would support him.
Mr Yeltsin could have nominated Mr Gaidar who came in the top three in a
ballot by the Congress. If this nomination was not confirmed by the
deputies, Mr Yeltsin could simply have appointed him acting prime minister
for a further three months. By this time the referendum on a new
constitution would be imminent and, if approved, a new parliament would have
been elected.
The political fallout may be immediately greater than the economic one. The
democrats, supporters of Mr Yeltsin, were terribly let down: Father Gleb
Yankunin, a leading radical deputy, said yesterday: 'After we did everything
to provide Yeltsin with a winning position, he let us down.' Mr Leonid
Volkov, another presidential supporter, said it was 'the end of a reforming
cabinet - at the choice of the President'.
He has now, it seems, put himself in the hands of the 'centre', an amorphous
group inside Congress and out, which includes real reformers and real
opponents of reform. Those who want change are disoriented and puzzled about
Mr Yeltsin's intentions. The departure of all of the key ministers,
including figures like Mr Anatoly Chubais and Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy
prime ministers in charge of privatisation and foreign economic relations
respectively, could deal a blow to reform and to the fragile trust of
foreign businessmen and governments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN an attempt to stem growing international demands for military
intervention against Serb forces in Bosnia, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian
Serb leader, yesterday said he will propose to his parliament a unilateral
end to the war.
'We will propose to the assembly of the Serbian Republic in a session on
December 17 to adopt a declaration on ending of the war,' he said in
reference to his self-proclaimed state covering some 70 per cent of Bosnian
territory.
'But I don't accept that we are proposing to end the war from the position
of winners, because we accept political solutions around the table,' he
declared in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital. 'In this way, we can
end the war before the new year.'
Despite Mr Karadzic's professed support to halt to the bloodshed, Sarajevo
yesterday came under mortar fire and shelling. UN officials in the Bosnian
capital said a ceasefire agreement, the nineteenth since the war began in
April, would take a few days to come into effect. Mr Mik Magnusson,
spokesman of the UN peacekeeping forces, said talks were under way for the
creation of three safe corridors. 'They are part of a step-by-step approach
to demilitarise the city, then lift the siege.' At least 17,000 people have
been killed and 100,000 have gone missing in the nine-month war.
Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday allowed evacuation under supervision by the
International Red Cross of 1,008 Moslem and Croat prisoners from the Manjaca
detention camp, northern Bosnia. Serb leaders say they will close the camp
on Friday after freeing 2,000 more detainees.
Ahead of Sunday's parliamentary and presidential elections in Yugoslavia, Mr
Milan Panic vowed to rout Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, widely seen
as responsible for the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Since he became federal
prime minister in July, Mr Panic has tried to end the war and lift UN
sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro.
Mr Panic, who is Mr Milosevic's strongest challenger, defended himself
against the campaign waged against him by state TV, which is in the grip of
the Serbian president. The television has accused Mr Panic of betraying
Serbia. He lashed out at Mr Milosevic saying: 'My efforts to build peace
have been bombed. Serbian national interests are with Europe, not
isolation.'
The Belgrade-born California millionaire is ahead of Mr Milosevic, according
to recent opinion polls. But their reliability is questionable because they
are conducted by phone and 40 per cent of Serbs do not have phones.
Mr Panic received backing yesterday from Yugoslavia's President Dobrica
Cosic, a writer held in high esteem in Serbia. Mr Cosic said he wanted to
end Yugoslavia's isolation. But he warned the west not to interfere by
openly supporting one or other candidate.

FT  15 DEC 92 / EC to pressure UK on HDTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain will face pressure from its EC partners today to approve funding for
a Brussels-backed strategy to market high definition television to the
European public, writes Lionel Barber. EC telecommunications ministers will
reconsider a European Commission plan to pump Ecu850m (Pounds 688m) into the

FT  15 DEC 92 / Deal blocked on duty-free goods

<TEXT>
Germany last night blocked an agreement to double the amount of duty-free
goods purchased inside the European Community to Ecu90 (Pounds 72),
excluding alcohol and cigarettes, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. A deal
would have raised EC citizens' travellers allowances on goods purchased
outside the Community to Ecu175 from January 1, 1993.
Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, who chaired the meeting,
expressed disappointment at the failure to reach a deal. He described the
limits on allowances, which go back to the 1950s, as 'wholly unacceptable'
in the light of the imminent official completion of the European single
market.
Germany's opposition stemmed from its failure to push through a claim to set
a road tax for EC vehicles using German highways. This dispute is to be
reviewed by EC transport ministers next Monday.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Lombard League tightens its grip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE populist Lombard League yesterday convincingly demonstrated it had
become the largest party in northern Italy at the expense of the long-ruling
Christian Democrats and Socialists, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The municipal elections, held over two days, covered 55 municipalities and
the province of La Spezia. With more than 1m voters, this was the first key
test of the political parties since general elections in April.
The protest vote evident in the general election was even more pronounced.
Yesterday it appeared directed against the main traditional parties and not
the Amato government but the result will complicate the existence of the
four-party coalition.
On the basis of early returns, the League looked set to win more than 35 per
cent of the vote in Varese, the home town of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League
leader, and 33 per cent in Monza.
If this trend is confirmed, it will mean almost a doubling of support in two
years for the League which campaigns against government corruption. Elements
of its policies are right-wing, although it could form a coalition with the
communists and could now aspire to run the Varese and Monza local
administrations in the Milan industrial region.
Voters' disenchantment with the Christian Democrats and Socialists, the
principal partners in the Amato four-party coalition government, increases
the pressure on these two parties to reform themselves and provide new
leadership. Attention is likely to focus in particular on Mr Bettino Craxi,
the Socialist leader, whose credibility has been badly damaged as a result
of the corruption scandal in his home base of Milan.
The success of the League appeared to extend further south to Liguria's
province of La Spezia where the movement's 2 per cent vote in municipal
elections two years ago rose to more than 14 per cent. Nationwide, the
Socialist party fared the worst, confirming the damage done to its
credibility as a result of the Milan corruption scandal. In many instances,
even in the south where it has had a strong base, the party saw its share
fall below 7 per cent.
The Christian Democrats' vote only held up in the south, where the
neo-fascist MSI party made considerable advances.

FT  15 DEC 92 / US wants war crime trials
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday proposed that the perpetrators of crimes against humanity
in the former Yugoslavia should be brought to justice in person, in the same
way the Nazi leaders were at the Nuremberg trials after the second world
war.
The proposal was made by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, secretary of state in the
outgoing US administration.
He spoke at the opening of a meeting of the 52-nation Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), at which the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia is the most important item on the agenda.
Mr Eagleburger tabled a series of measures to transform the CSCE, widely
criticised for failing to back up its declarations with practical measures
to solve the growing number of conflicts in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union, into a more positive problem-solving organisation.
The CSCE had to develop a strategy which was proactive, not reactive, he
said.
The aim should be to detect early signs of crises and instability and
undertake preventive diplomacy.
'We must seek early enough to prevent the outbreak of conflict, or else find
ourselves, as in Yugoslavia, constantly reacting to new horrors.'
CSCE missions to assist with the enforcement of UN sanctions, of the kind
already sent to Kosovo, Macedonia and Georgia, must be expanded to prevent
war from spilling over into neighbouring countries and regions, as it
threatened to do from Bosnia. The US would contribute, 'on an urgent basis,'
to the expansion of the Kosovo mission, Mr Eagleburger promised.
In addition, the administration and financing of the CSCE had to be
strengthened to ensure a more effective response to the challenges of
conflict prevention and crisis management.
The ministers are due to agree in principle today to the appointment of a
permanent secretary-general, a post for which the Germans have put forward
their permanent representative to the CSCE, Mr Wilhelm Hoynck.
They will also formally approve the nomination of Mr Max van der Stoel, a
former Dutch foreign minister, as the CSCE's new High Commissioner on
National Minorities, another post which has been created to strengthen the
organisation's capacity for preventive diplomacy and wider respect of human
rights.
In line with the general desire to prevent conflicts before they become
unmanageable, the ministers have decided to send a small CSCE mission to
Estonia for six months from next February, to try to ease the tension
between the country's Estonian and Russian population and help create a
civil society on the western model.
Ethnic Russians make up about 40 per cent of Estonia's total population of
1.6m, but they do not have the automatic right to citizenship of the
country.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand yesterday renominated Mrs Christiane Scrivener
as France's junior EC commissioner, in a quick move to recover from a
blunder at the Edinburgh summit when he announced she would be succeeded by
Mr Edmond Alphandery, who then promptly refused the job.
Mr Alphandery, a centrist politician, said he preferred to seek re-election
to the French parliament in March, but is also tipped as a possible finance
minister in the centre-right government which is expected to emerge from
next spring's election.
What Mr Alphandery described as an 'unfortunate misunderstanding' resulted
from the fact that he was ready to go to Brussels, provided he could combine
Mrs Scrivener's EC tax portfolio with the EC monetary job at present in the
Danish hands of Mr Henning Christophersen.
He was still vainly trying to negotiate this - through Mr Jacques Delors,
France's other commissioner, who heads the EC executive - when Mr
Mitterrand, believing the deal was done, prematurely announced his
appointment.
The president seems to have been attempting domestic political manoeuvring
with the job of Mrs Scrivener, a Giscardian liberal, by offering it to
various Christian Democrats, including Mr Alphandery. The ploy did not work,
as opposition politicians now have national office in their sights.
There is the extra disincentive that, if the Maastricht treaty enters into
force, the next EC Commission's tenure will only be two years.
Mrs Scrivener was yesterday said to have taken the president's reluctant
renewal of her mandate philosophically, commenting that it was the end
result which mattered. She has showed the same pragmatism in getting,
against considerable odds, EC governments to remove fiscal checks at EC
internal borders from January.

FT  15 DEC 92 / French inflation at six-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S annual inflation rate eased from 2.4 per cent in October to 2.1 per
cent last month, the lowest for six years, according to provisional figures
by Insee, the state statistics body.
Month on month, prices were stable in November, after rising 0.3 per cent in
the previous month.
This brings price rises since the start of the year to 2 per cent and puts
France on track to undershoot Insee's most recent forecast of 2.5 per cent
inflation for 1992 overall.
Food prices fell last month and there was a small rise in the prices of oil
products, pushed up by the dollar's recovery against the franc, according to
the ministry of finance.
Prices of manufactured products were unchanged in November.
The reduction leaves France's annual inflation 1.6 percentage points below
that in western Germany, its main trading partner, continuing the
improvement in price competitiveness since French inflation dropped below
Germany's in June 1991.
Annualised French inflation last month was also 1.3 per cent below the
average level for its nine main trading partners, a small improvement from
the 1.2 per cent gap in October.

<TEXT>
MR Viktor Chernomyrdin, unexpectedly appointed as Russia's prime minister
yesterday, is widely recognised as a superb manager of the old Soviet
school.
Any enthusiasm reform supporters might have shown for his appointment was
soured by the refusal of Mr Yegor Gaidar, whom he replaces, to stay on as
economic strategist and the likely resignation of other young reformist
ministers.
'Surrounded by a few decent chaps, he is capable of behaving wisely,' said
one western diplomat, who hoped that at least Mr Anatoly Chubais, the
privatisation minister, would not step down.
'But on his own Chernomyrdin is a terrible menace to reforms,' he added.
'He is very impressive but he is definitely of the Old Guard,' said a
businessman who has dealt with him in the past.
His success as manager of the Soviet gas monopoly, Gasprom, prompted his
appointment in June as deputy prime minister responsible for energy policy
when president Boris Yeltsin sacrificed his young minister for oil and gas,
Mr Vladimir Lopukhin. But expectations that this avuncular-looking
54-year-old would quickly restore order to the country's most important
industry proved unfounded.
Oil output has been continually falling.
This means Russia, long the world's largest energy producer, has dropped
behind Saudi Arabia in the league table, producing 7.9m barrels of oil per
day. Saudi oil output is currently about 8.4m bpd.
'He's made some progress in restoring centralised control to the industry,
but he's neither stopped the theft of oil nor spurred foreign investment,'
said the businessman. 'He's at ease with yielding power but it is impossible
to predict how he will react to a multi-faceted brief,' he added.
Mr Chernomyrdin, who presents a somewhat unworldly figure, is said to be
unencumbered by ideology from his past as a senior communist party official.
But given the difficulties of trying to turn back the clock, reforms in
Russia could well suffer from his lack of vision.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the German minister of posts and
telecommunications, resigned from the government yesterday, sharply
criticising its failure to act more forcefully in the ethnic conflict in the
former Yugoslavia.
He also accused his government colleagues of failing to give him
wholehearted support in negotiations on reforms to privatise the German
postal and telecommunications services.
Privatisation has been held up by failure to reach agreement with the trade
unions and opposition Social Democrats on changes needed to the German
constitution to enable the state sale to go ahead.
He attacked the government - and by implication Chancellor Helmut Kohl  -
for getting bogged down in negotiations within the ruling coalition, and
proving itself incapable of action on key political issues.
The resignation will embarrass Chancellor Kohl in his struggle to show his
government is coming to grips with the problems of looming economic
recession and the soaring costs of German unification.
However, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, a member of the cabinet since Mr Kohl came to
power in 1982, was expected to be ousted in a reshuffle at Christmas or in
the New Year.
Some observers believed he was simply choosing to resign with dignity,
rather than be forced out.
Mr Schwarz-Schilling's negotiating position in the privatisation talks with
the unions and SPD had weakened since he was expected to go in the
reshuffle.
A new minister might be able to push the process ahead more swiftly.
Mr Schwarz-Schilling's resignation coincided with an appeal from the German
Chamber of Trade and Industry (DIHT) to break the deadlock on postal reform.
The resignation follows reports that Mr Schwarz-Schilling lost his temper at
last week's cabinet meeting because of the government's apparent inability
to take more effective action in Bosnia-Hercegovina to protect the local
population from Serbian attacks.
He admitted yesterday saying that he was 'ashamed to be a member of a
cabinet which simply does nothing'. Mr Kohl retorted that no one was
compelled to remain a member of the government.
Mr Schwarz-Schilling said at a press conference in Bonn it was a nonsense
that German naval ships on patrol in the Adriatic were forbidden from taking
part in actions to stop and search suspected arms smugglers.
At the same time, he sharply criticised the UN arms embargo as it affected
Bosnia-Hercegovina, saying it simply exacerbated the unequal conflict with
the Serbs.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Major to warn Bush over force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the British prime minister, will this weekend warn outgoing
US President George Bush that the use of force to enforce the UN 'no-fly
zone' over Bosnia could put at risk British ground troops and aid workers in
the former Yugoslav province.
Senior Downing Street officials yesterday acknowledged the growing
international pressure for a new UN resolution authorising military measures
against Serbian aircraft violating the ban on flights. But they voiced
concern that precipitate action could lead to heavy casualties for UK forces
in Bosnia and an end to the humanitarian aid effort.
Washington has expressed growing impatience with the Serbs, with
president-elect Bill Clinton backing the tougher stance of the Bush
administration. The deteriorating situation in Bosnia will be the focus of
two days of talks between Mr Major and Mr Bush at Camp David.
Mr Major, current president of the European Community council, will arrive
in Washington on Friday for the EC/US summit.
The officials said a new UN resolution authorising tougher action against
Serbia to enforce the zone looked increasingly likely after public
statements in favour of such action by France and the US.
But while Britain was unlikely to block such a resolution, Mr Major would
tell Mr Bush that early action to shoot down Serbian aircraft would almost
certaintly provoke retaliation against the 2,000 British ground troops
escorting aid convoys.
They pointed out that the US faces no such risks as it has not deployed
troops. Attacks on the escort troops might also effectively halt the
transport of humanitarian aid.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR predicted yesterday that the Edinburgh summit would lead to a
decisive shift in the direction of the European Community with its
enlargement to at least 15 members by the beginning of 1995.
As the successful outcome of the summit won a warm reception from most
Conservative MPs at Westminster, Mr Major said he expected Sweden, Finland,
Austria, and possibly, Norway, to join the EC in the near future.
Seizing the opportunity to undercut Tory critics of the Maastricht treaty,
he said the agreement to pledge eventual membership to Hungary, Poland and
the Czech and Slovak Republics would allow also the boundaries of the
Community to be moved across eastern Europe.
Tory Euro-sceptic MPs pledged to continue their fight against British
ratification of Maastricht, but the view at Westminster was that the summit
had significantly weakened their chances of wrecking the legislation.
In a confident mood after what even some opposition MPs conceded had been a
considerable negotiating success, Mr Major emphasised that the Community
would now move towards enlargement and decentralisation, both long favoured
by Britain.
By setting out procedures to enforce the concept of subsidiarity EC leaders
had agreed that 'national decisions should be the rule and Brussels action
the exception', he said.
Resolution of Denmark's demands for exemptions from the treaty and
settlement of the EC budget for the rest of the decade meant that the
Community had now 'come together again as 12 member states with a common
purpose'.
However, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, sharply criticised the failure of
the summit to agree an emergency package of measures to reverse the rising
tide of unemployment throughout Europe.
Attacking the UK presidency's 'deplorable neglect' of the social dimension
of the Community, he said the economic package agreed had failed to meet the
appalling prospect of further large increases in unemployment.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday threw inter-national diplomacy into confusion by announcing
a radical return to a cold war foreign policy and then retracting the
statement, explaining that it was no more than a scare tactic.
In one of the most bizarre diplomatic incidents of recent years, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, left ministers from 52 western and
eastern European countries dumbfounded when he said Russia was reneging on
its post-communist policies of co-operation with the West. For good measure,
he also demanded an end to the arms embargo against Serbia.
His short, but explicit, statement exploded like a bombshell on the opening
day of the two-day ministerial meeting in Stockholm of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe, an organisation dedicated to conflict
prevention and management and the respect of human rights.
As stunned ministers crowded round Mr Kozyrev, long regarded as a moderate
in the Russian leadership, to demand clarification, he coolly announced that
they should wait for his second statement.
Some 45 minutes later he rose to his feet to tell his amazed audience that
he did not mean a word of what he had said. 'Neither President Yeltsin, who
remains the leader and guarantor of Russian domestic and foreign policy, nor
I myself, as minister for foreign affairs, would ever agree with what I read
out in my previous statement.'
With no apparent sign of rem-orse, the normally restrained and diplomatic Mr
Kozyrev thanked those present for 'the opportunity to use this rhetorical
de-vice'. It was inspired by the most serious concern that everyone should
be aware of the genuine threats faced by the Russian leadership 'on our
course towards a post-Communist Europe'.
Mr Kozyrev has remained outspokenly anti-conservative - warning that the
conduct of a rational foreign policy was being made impossible by a growing
nationalist tide in Russia. His device to warn people of a conservative
victory does not contradict his beliefs.
'A wake-up call' is how Mrs Galina Sidorova, the Russian spokeswoman,
described Mr Kozyrev's first statement.
Only an hour or so previously, however, she and other Russian delegates had
been rendered livid and speechless by his intervention - of which none of
them had received advance notice.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, who left Stockholm last night
to join Chancellor Helmut Kohl for an official visit to Russia, was also
unamused. 'An international forum is not the place for such behaviour,' he
said.
Mr Anatolyi Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said: 'Maybe Mr Kozyrev
has a sense of humour, but it is dangerous to use such tactics.' Mr
Kozyrev's speech was 'like smoking - dangerous to health', said Mr Lawrence
Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, lighting another cigarette.
In his first speech, Mr Kozyrev said: 'We clearly recognise that our
traditions in many respects, if not fundamentally, lie in Asia, and this
sets limits to our rapprochement with western Europe.' He accused Nato and
the nine-nation Western European Union defence organisation of drawing up
plans to strengthen their military presence in the Baltic and other regions
'on the territory of the former Soviet Union', and of interfering in Bosnia
and the internal affairs of Yugoslavia.
Clearly, sanctions against Serbia were dictated by this policy, he said. 'We
demand that they be lifted, and if this does not happen, we reserve our
right to take the necessary unilateral measures to defend our interests,
especially since they cause us economic harm.' He said the former Soviet
Union was 'a post-imperial space', in which Russia had to defend its
interests, if necessary by military means.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Russians agree on new PM after switch by Yeltsin: Reform
programme may slow as energy minister replaces Gaidar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Russian reform was thrown into doubt last night after Mr Yegor
Gaidar, one of President Boris Yeltsin's closest allies and the architect of
radical economic policies, was thrown out of office.
'I don't believe all we did was in vain,' Mr Gaidar said after hearing Mr
Yeltsin had failed in his bid to have him appointed as prime minister.
Mr Gaidar, who had been acting prime minister, was replaced by Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, 54, formerly deputy prime minister responsible for energy.
'Of course I will resign and not return,' said Mr Gaidar, 36, immediately on
learning that Mr Yeltsin, formerly his proclaimed supporter, had chosen to
put Mr Chernomyrdin in his place.
Mr Sergei Shakrai, deputy prime minister in charge of ethnic affairs, was
said last night to be preparing a mass resignation of ministers closely
associated with Mr Gaidar - including Mr Anatoly Chubias, deputy prime
minister in charge of privatisation; Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime
minister for foreign economic relations; Mr Andrei Nechayev, economics
minister; and Mr Pyotr Aven, trade minister.
Both Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin are likely to try to persuade them to
stay but indications last night were that they would go with Mr Gaidar.
Mr Gaidar's aides confirmed his ousting was a surprise, running against the
string of promises made by Mr Yeltsin to do everything he could to keep him.
Mr Chernomyrdin, in a speech to the Congress, promised to continue reforms
'but not through the impoverishment of the people' - a remark which won him
applause. In a later interview with the news agency Itar Tass, he said that
he would proceed 'to reforms, to a market economy but not to a bazaar'.
Russia should concentrate on halting a steep fall in output, Mr Chernomyrdin
told reporters after chairing his first government meeting. 'I think the
reforms should now take on a somewhat different tone, move on to another
stage,' he added.
The new prime minister, with a final vote of 721, succeeded in uniting all
but the radical democratic part of the Congress behind his candidature. Mr
Yeltsin's radical supporters were furious and bewildered by his action.
Mr Mikhail Schneider, a senior official of the Democratic Russia movement,
said: 'Every step we made in the past few days was based on the assumption
that Yeltsin would nominate Gaidar. Now that he has acted otherwise we don't
know what to do.'
One minister, who asked not to be identified, said Mr Yeltsin had decided
not to support Mr Gaidar after gathering only 400 of the deputies' votes. Mr
Gaidar, he said, refused to resign but was removed by Mr Yeltsin.
Over the weekend Mr Gaidar had been prepared to step down to give the
president freedom to act in the best interests of the country, one of his
advisers said.
However, he was also prepared to continue to work as head of an economic
reform team, if the alternative choice as prime minister had been to his
liking - for example, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister.
Mr Gaidar had also thought of taking another post, including that of head of
the president's council of advisers, vacant after the sacking of Mr Gennady
Burbulis at the weekend. However, according to his advisers last night, he
has decided against it.
Though Mr Chernomyrdin topped the vote of the deputies, Mr Gaidar did well
enough to stay in the first three. He could thus have been nominated by Mr
Yeltsin and made acting prime minister for three months, if not confirmed by
the Congress.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Fuel price rises may be used to reduce emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER fuel prices may be needed if the UK is to meet international targets
for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, a government discussion paper said
yesterday.
According to Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, some of the
measures the UK will have to take to meet international commitments 'will
not be easy'.
He denied that the debate about the future of coal could jeopardise the UK's
ability to meet international targets, even though the use of coal in power
stations to generate electricity emits twice as much carbon dioxide as the
use of gas. 'If the review decides that more energy is to be produced by
coal, more savings will have to be found elsewhere,' he said.
One of the main targets of the paper is transport, the sector where
emissions are growing fastest. A 10 per cent rise in fuel prices above the
rate of inflation could prevent emission of one million tonnes of carbon a
year (MtC), or about 0.6 per cent of the UK's total emissions, the paper
says. Equipping new cars with speed limiters and reflecting fuel efficiency
in the price of new cars could save another 2 per cent.
On government projections, UK emissions in the year 2000 are likely to be at
least 6 per cent, or about 10 MtC, above target levels.
However, car sales tax was abolished in the Autumn Statement, a measure to
help stimulate the depressed car market. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's
environment spokesman, said: 'The Autumn Statement was all about building
roads and not about investing in public transport.'
More than 150 countries have signed the United Nations framework convention
on climate change, agreed at the Rio Earth Summit in June. Under the
convention they must make plans to stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide at
1990 levels by the year 2000. Mr Howard said that the UK intended to ratify
the convention by the end of 1993, obliging it to bring emissions back to
160 MtC.
According to a report last month by the Department of Trade and Industry,
the UK's carbon dioxide emissions in the year 2000 could be between 157 MtC
and 179MtC. Yesterday's paper uses the middle case of 170MtC.
The DTI projections were based on an assumption that the proportion of
electricity generated by coal would fall sharply during the 1990s from 68
per cent to 47 per cent, while gas generation of electricity would rise from
zero to about 22 per cent.
A carbon or energy tax is among the options in the paper. It also lists
measures to encourage energy efficiency by businesses and households.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, warned: 'We are running hard to stand still - investment by
industry, commerce and households in energy saving measures is down by 28
per cent in the past two years.'

FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru aims to reverse 20 years
of mine neglect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY MARKS the end of an ignominious chapter in Peruvian mining history.
After more than 20 years of neglect, state-owned mining company Mineroperu
will relinquish control over the first of a series of rich deposits.
Quellaveco, first under the hammer, is expected to be hotly disputed by two
big names in the mining world: Southern Peru Copper Corporation, a
subsidiary of Asarco Incorporated, and the South-African giant
Anglo-American through its Chilean subsidiary Mantos Blancos. Rio Anglom of
Canada is also expected to put in a bid, as is Chile's Pudahuel.
Logic suggests that SPCC is the most likely buyer. The Quellaveco copper
deposits lie between the corporation's two huge open-pit copper mines,
Cuajone and Toquepala which produce two-thirds of Peru's copper. Developing
Quellaveco will almost certainly involve use of SPCC's infrastructure - the
railway that ferries concentrates from the mines to the smelter and port of
Ilo as well as the water and electricity supply, both operated by SPCC.
'Without using the existing SPCC infrastructure, the investment demanded for
Quellaveco would be astronomical,' said a senior Peruvian mine manager. 'If
Southern doesn't get it, then the winning bidder might have to come to some
joint venture agreement with them.'
Quellaveco is in the province of Moquegua, 930 km (580 miles) south-east of
Lima, on western slopes of the Andes and about 3,600 metres (11,800 ft)
above sea level. Reserves are estimated at 388.5m tonnes with 0.85 per cent
copper at a cut-off grade of 0.45 per cent.
The deposit is characterised by a large percentage of secondary sulphide
reserves. Experts say prospects for heap-leaching are 'very interesting'.
While this could mean a smaller outlay than that associated with a
traditional concentrator plant, Mineroperu conditions for bidding require
the buyer to process a minimum of 10,000 tonnes of ore a day.
The cash minimum fixed by Mineroperu for Quellaveco is a modest Dollars 9m,
intended to cover the state's investment in studies and surveys over past
years. The deposit will go to the bidder who offers the most attractive
cash-plus-development package. SPCC executives familiar with the deposit say
integral development at Quellaveco would involve investment of between
Dollars 300m and Dollars 350m.
The corporation could find it hard to come up with that sort of money. It
has already committed itself to investing Dollars 300m in Peru over the next
couple of years to construct electrowinning plants at both its mines and on
essential environmental improvements at its Ilo smelter.
Despite SPCC's track-record of profitability, the corporation has had
difficulty in persuading US banks to come up with financing. It is going
ahead with its Peruvian investment programme with an initial Dollars 100m
from its own resources and a Dollars 60m loan recently approved by the
Andean Development Corporation.
Early next year Mineroperu will be embarking on the separate sale of its
four operational units - the Cerro Verde copper deposits, the copper
refinery at Ilo, Cajamarquilla's zinc refinery and the San Antonio de Poto
gold deposits.
Technical assessments for all these have now been completed by British-based
International Mining Consultants and promotion will be handled by Morgan
Grenfell in association with Minproc, a Peruvian-Canadian company.

FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (4): High
point in a hard year - The futures market gets under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE being the largest bond market in Europe, the Italian market has been
rather slow to develop more sophisticated financial instruments based on
bonds.
So the development of a domestic futures market counts as a high point in
what has otherwise proved a difficult year for the Italian bond market.
Mif, the Mercato Italiano Futures (Mif), was launched in September, at a
time when the bond market was particularly volatile and trading volume
unusually high. Mif added a 10-year bond futures contract to the existing
Telematico screen-based system, which is used for government bond trading.
The new market succeeded in attracting a fresh domestic investor base, which
had not previously traded futures.
In addition, Mif won some business from the London International Financial
Futures Exchange (Liffe).
Liffe launched its highly successful 10-year Italian government bond
contract in September 1991, and saw off a rival contract launched by the
Matif, the Paris-based exchange.
The contract helped bring more sophisticated investors, including arbitrage
players, into the Italian market. In June, the Liffe contract traded an
impressive average daily volume of 29,000 contracts in June.
Since the launch of Mif, Liffe's market share has fallen to 60 per cent,
currently around 9,000 contracts a day, following a decline in volume due to
the market's fall from favour.
The Italian market is unusual in supporting two actively-traded competing
contracts, both actively traded: the other notable example is that of the
rival Bund contracts traded by Liffe and the German exchange, the Deutsche
Terminborse, with about the same market split.
'It is very likely that the Liffe and Mif contracts will co-exist,' believes
Mr Eugenio Namor, head of futures broking at San Paolo in London, since they
still serve rather different investor bases.
The introduction of the two bond futures contracts has made the market both
easier to trade and more attractive to a broad range of investors.
The futures market proved its value during the crisis month of September.
When the cash market had totally dried up, so that investors were unable to
get prices or sell bonds, the futures market continued to trade.
Mif is currently preparing a new bond contract, based on five-year bonds,
which is scheduled for launch on December 18.
Some dealers believe the new contract will help attract more international
business to the Italian exchange.
'Most international players have stuck with Liffe, because they are more
familiar with it,' says one Italian trader familiar with both markets. 'But
the five-year contract will give investors the chance to play the yield
curve.'
The contract will also be of use provide a vital new hedging instruments for
swap traders.
Mif is also planning to develop a three-month interest rate future, similar
to that traded on Liffe.
The introduction of the five-year bond contract could also have an effect on
the shape of the Italian yield curve.
Currently, the yield curve is flat. However, Mr Steve Major, a bond analyst
at Credit Lyonnais Securities, believes that the flatness of the yield curve
has been exaggerated by the concentration of activity in the 10-year area,
because it is easier to hedge through existing contracts.
He argues that the longer end of the yield curve should be more upward
sloping, reflecting uncertainty on such issues as the budget deficit.
The availability of a hedging instrument for five-year bonds could shift
activity from 10-year to five-year paper, causing 10-year yields to rise.
Some traders believe that there is currently a liquidity premium on offer in
five-year yields, which could disappear once the five-year area is more
actively traded.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Total warns of steep fall in
earnings for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL yesterday became the second French oil company to forecast a steep
profits decline for the year, when it warned net earnings in 1992 would drop
by more than the 47 per cent decrease recorded in the first six months.
Mr Serge Tchuruk, Total's chairman, told a shareholders' meeting the
first-half decline would be 'confirmed or slightly exceeded in the full
year', prompting a fall in the share prices of Total and Elf Aquitaine, its
larger French rival.
The squeeze on refining margins over the past year and the dollar's decline,
has hit Total harder than Elf Aquitaine, because more of Total's activities
are downstream. Elf recently predicted a 35 per cent fall in 1992 profits,
citing several reasons including over-capacity in the petrochemicals
industry.
Total's forecast includes the impact of a FFr600m (Dollars 113.2m) charge
for restructuring and writing down the value of some non-strategic assets,
as well as the FFr50m it will have to contribute towards repairing a
fire-damaged refinery, the rest of which is covered by insurance.
Mr Tchuruk warned the gloomy international economic situation may last
through the first half of the year, despite encouraging signs from the US.
However, Total planned to maintain its dividend this year unless the oil
industry outlook worsened.

FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Maho in collaboration talks with
rival Deckel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISCLOSURE yesterday that Maho, the stricken German machine tool group,
is in collaboration talks with rival Deckel has highlighted the urgency of
the industry's search for cost-savings.
Mr Bodo Viets, Maho chairman since the end of June, said he could give no
further details for fear of derailing the negotiations. He was speaking
after winning shareholder approval for a capital restructuring which forms
the launch-pad for his recovery plans.
He told the annual meeting in Munich that group losses in the current
financial year would fall to less than DM100m (Dollars 66.6m), against the
DM157m reported in the 12 months to end-June, 1992. The deficit at Maho AG,
the German parent, reached DM22m at the half-way mark, he said.
Sales, which slumped 31 per cent last year to DM442m, will fall a further 10
per cent in the current year, he added.
The company, which aims to return to profit in 1993/94, is expected to fall
under the effective control of a group of eight banks, including Deutsche
Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Commmerzbank, after the annual meeting
approved a complex package which should reduce the holding of the Babel
family from around 54 per cent to 25 per cent.
Last week Maho and Traub, a machine tools group which lost DM30m in 1991 and
had a first-half DM16m deficit this year, announced the merger of their
distribution networks. The companies estimated the deal would save each
group DM8.5m in 1993 and twice that in the following year.
Talks are to continue on co-operation in purchasing, manufacture and
research and development, but full merger or share swaps are not on the
agenda.
The alliance followed the establishment of a similar collaboration,
effective from January, between Gildemeister, which lost DM29m in 1991 and
Deckel which expects a DM70m deficit in the current year.
The machine tool industry has been especially hard hit by the investment
cuts which have characterised international industry's reaction to
recession. With the domestic downturn accelerating - new orders at Deckel
were down 6 per cent at the end of September - the need to rationalise is
growing more urgent.
After two years of retrenchment, the scope for job cuts is limited and
savings have to be found elsewhere. Maho, which in the past year reduced its
workforce by a third to 2,320, has introduced widespread short-time and
plans a further reduction of 400 places during the current year.
So far, alliances have been forged between companies which do not compete
directly with one another. While Maho is a milling specialist, Traub's main
strength is in computer-steered turning centres. Gildemeister makes turning
machines, while Deckel concentrates on milling.
Mr Viets, who said talks were under way with other companies, noted a merger
with Deckel would have grave consequences because plants would have to be
shut.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Mapic warns members to expect sizeable
additional calls for money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAPIC, the accountants' professional indemnity insurance mutual, has warned
its members of possible substantial additional calls for money in response
to sharply rising litigation against the firms.
Mr Roger Pedder, chairman, says in the report for the year to June 30 that
members should make provisions of 6 per cent for 1990-91 and 7 per cent for
1991-92.
The report warns that if the adverse trend of greater claims continues,
underwriting rates may have to rise when they are next renewed.
Claims paid by Mapic rose 51 per cent to Pounds 520,000. Contingent claims
almost doubled to Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 1.61m) in the period; the company
estimates these will be settled for Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 848,000).
The underwriting summary says there was 'dramatic claim inflation' in
1990-91, reflecting a litigious climate and the state of the economy.
There has been a growth in claims against accountants for failing to detect
'misappropriations' by employees.
Typical claims concerned failures in tax advice, particularly in relation to
capital gains. There were also claims for alleged failure to detect fraud on
audit.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Berkeley rides recession with 27% rise to
Pounds 6.9m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERKELEY Group, the Surrey-based housebuilder, continued to buck the sector
trend with a 27 per cent increase in first half profits; the interim
dividend goes up 10 per cent.
The group also said it plans to increase its investment in the UK commercial
property market through its joint venture with Saad Investments, subject to
shareholder approval.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 6.92m in the six months to October 31,
against Pounds 5.43m last time.
Turnover expanded 47 per cent to Pounds 75.8m (Pounds 51.7m) with the number
of house sales increasing 39 per cent to 468 (336) units.
Earnings per share increased to 7.6p (6.1p) and the interim dividend is
lifted from 1.5p to 1.65p.
Both turnover and operating profits, ahead to Pounds 6.43m (Pounds 4.33m),
include St George, the London-based builder, which became a 100 per cent
subsidiary in September last year.
Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, said the results had been achieved 'in a
housing market in which demand has been extremely uncertain and in which
house prices have continued to decline with a consequent adverse effect on
margins.'
He said Berkeley Eastoak Investments, the commercial property joint venture
with Saad Investments, has so far invested Pounds 63m and is in the process
of investing a further Pounds 22.4m.
Its portfolio of 66 properties has mainly blue chip corporate tenants and is
producing an average net yield of 10.7 per cent.
Because of 'the continuing acquisition opportunities arising out of the
depressed conditions in the UK commercial property market,' the joint
venture partners plan to invest a further Pounds 100m, of which Berkeley's
commitment will be up to Pounds 25m.
As with the initial Pounds 100m, the majority of this investment will be
financed by bank loans.
COMMENT
The secret of Berkeley's success has been timing. It decided in late 1988 to
liquidate the land bank and since then has operated a 'buy-build' policy of
acquiring small parcels of quality land, mostly for immediate use. As a
result most of the land used during the first half was acquired in the last
18 months - at reasonable prices. The balance sheet is strong with
shareholders funds expected to top Pounds 140m at the year end and Pounds 2m
of net cash. The off-balance sheet joint venture in commercial property is
structured in such a way as to minimise risks for shareholders and appears
to represent a low risk speculative play with the potential for significant
medium term capital gains. Even without improvement in the core private
housing business, profits should top Pounds 15m pre-tax this year. The
shares, which jumped 20p yesterday to 290p, are on a deservedly high
prospective multiple of about 17. This is a stock to hold, or buy on signs
of weakness.

Harry Kuiper, a director of Daks Simpson, the clothing manufacturer and

Kuiper, 55, was managing director of production at Daks' Larkhall factory in
Scotland, and joined the board in 1981.
Daks says it does not know Kuiper's plans. His resignation was 'quite
unconnected' with other departures this year, including that of Johnny
Mengers, the pony-tailed chief executive who had been with the company for
40 years.
There was speculation that Mengers' departure resulted from friction between
him and Sankyo Seiko. But the company insisted that the new Japanese owner

FT  15 DEC 92 / Bribery charges against Tory MP dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIBERY charges against Mr Harry Greenway, the Tory MP, were dropped
yesterday by the Crown Prosecution Service after the collapse last week of
the trial of three other men charged with corruption over attempts to win
rail maintenance contracts from British Rail.
Mr Greenway had been due to stand trial at the Old Bailey next October. The
charges against him alleged he had corruptly accepted gifts including air
tickets from Plasser Railway Machinery GB, a long-time supplier of track
maintenance equipment to BR. The Austrian-owned company was based in Mr
Greenway's Ealing North constituency.
It was alleged that the gifts from Plasser GB included flights to
Switzerland, Germany and Austria and tickets to an exhibition of the Spanish
Riding School at Wembley.
It was claimed in return that Mr Greenway had used his position as an MP to
try to influence the appointment of a BR chairman and in trying to obtain
British nationality for a Plasser director. Mr Greenway always denied the
charges
The CPS's decision to drop the charges against Mr Greenway follows the
acquittals of Plasser GB, Mr Norbert Jurasek, its managing director, Mr
Michael Brooks, its company secretary and Mr David Currie, a former head of
British Rail's civil engineering division.
The trial judge had ruled there was insufficient evidence for their cases to
go to a jury.
The CPS said that after the collapse of the first trial, Mrs Barbara Mills,
the Director of Public Prosecutions, had decided there was no longer a
realistic prospect of Mr Greenway being convicted.
Mr Greenway said after the announcement of the decision: 'This has been an
extraordinarily long ordeal but I always knew I would be vindicated.'
Mr Greenway is thought to have been the first member of parliament to face
trial charged with corruption. He tried unsuccessfully to argue that a
criminal trial was the wrong forum for such alleged behaviour to be judged,
insisting that a committee of MPs should be the correct jury in his case.
The argument failed when the judge ruled that the charges referred to Mr
Greenway having violated his duties as an MP. However, Mr Greenway was able
to win a separate trial, unconnected with that of the three other
defendants.
Yesterday's decision marks the failure of the largest case brought for many
years by the British Transport Police, a body that remains part of British
Rail, but which acts independently.
A lengthy investigation by the BTP, before the case was handed over to the
Fraud Investigation Group within the CPS, resulted in the arrests in
September 1988 of Mr Jurasek, Mr Brooks and Mr Currie. Mr Greenway was
arrested in September 1990.
In the first trial, the prosecution claimed that Plasser's hospitality,
including air tickets, trips to Continental nightclubs, complimentary
tickets to watch the rugby at Twickenham and gifts of champagne and wine,
was on such a scale it amounted to a corrupt attempt over a 10-year period
to win business from BR.
The scale of the alleged corruption was widespread, it argued. The charges
the men faced were mere samples. If there were a charge for every
transaction that took place, the courtroom would be full of defendants, it
was alleged.
However, the judge later ruled there was no evidence of the alleged bribes
having worked. The transactions complained of totalled only Pounds 11,000
over 10 years.
Prosecution allegations that Mr Currie had received so much hospitality that
he had led the life of a rich man had not been supported by evidence, he
said.
He also strongly criticised BR for not having taken firmer steps to reduce
the hospitality offered by Plasser although it was on a scale that breached
BR's own guidelines. In spite of an internal BR inquiry held in 1983, no
attempt had been made to correct the situation, the judge said.
In spite of its failure, the prosecution has focused attention on the
practices of corporate hospitality, widely accepted as a normal part of
business and commercial life, and the differences between the public and
private sectors in its application.
As one lawyer involved in the case commented, had BR been in the private
sector, where generous corporate hospitality is accepted to a greater
degree, it is unlikely the case would ever have come to court.
Reporting restrictions preventing any linkage of Mr Greenway with the first
Plasser trial were lifted before the CPS's announcement yesterday.

FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: UBS purchases London office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION BANK of Switzerland has bought its London office building from
Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, the company jointly owned by Stanhope
Properties and Rosehaugh, which recently went into receivership.
In effect, the deal pays off the Pounds 200m loan made by UBS on the
building. UBS will also benefit from tax losses worth tens of millions of
pounds.
UBS and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, its stockbroking subsidiary, occupy the 390,000
sq ft building in the Broadgate development. UBS pays an annual rent of
Pounds 13m.
BP3, the RSD subsidiary that owned the building, incurred a net loss of
Pounds 17.8m in the year to June 30 and had net assets of Pounds 15.1m.
However, the value of City office buildings has since fallen sharply;
according to Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyors, they have dropped 20
per cent over the past year.
UBS described the deal as further evidence of its firm commitment to its
operations in London.
Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive of Stanhope, said that following RSD's
recent signing of a five year extension to its banking arrangements, the
sale was further evidence of the stability of the group and the quality of
its assets.
RSD is also in talks with Credit Lyonnais about the acquisition of the
building it occupies.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: 'Paving the way for a return to
confidence'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following is an edited text of the conclusions of the two-day European
Council summit:
THE European Council agreed on resolutions to a wide range of issues
essential to progress in Europe. This paves the way for a return to
confidence by its citizens in European construction which will contribute to
the recovery of the European economy. In particular the European Council
reached agreement on the following major issues:
The problems raised by Denmark in the light of the outcome of the Danish
referendum on June 2 1992 on the Maastricht treaty.
Guidelines to implement the subsidiary principle and measures to increase
transparency and openness in the decision-making process of the Community.
The financing of the Community action and policies during the rest of this
decade.
Launching of enlargement negotiation with a number of Efta countries.
The establishment of a plan of action by the member states and the Community
to promote growth and to combat unemployment.
Treaty on European union - state of ratification: The members of the
European Council reaffirmed their commitment to the treaty. Ratification is
necessary to make progress towards European union and for the Community to
remain an anchor of stability in a rapidly changing continent, building on
its success over the last four decades.
The European Council agreed to the texts set out in these conclusions
concerning the issues raised by Denmark in its memorandum 'Denmark in
Europe'. This will create the basis for the Community to develop together,
on the basis of the Maastricht treaty, while respecting, as the treaty does,
the identity and diversity of member states.
Subsidiarity: European union rests on the principle of subsidiarity. . . It
aims at decisions being taken as closely as possible to the citizen.
The European Council reaffirmed its commitment. . . to a more open
Community. The European Council welcomed the measures the Community has
recently decided to take in the field of transparency. These include
producing the annual work programme in October, to allow for wider debate
including in national parliaments.
Accession of new member states: Official negotiations with Efta countries
seeking membership of the union will be opened immediately after the treaty
on European union is ratified and the agreement has been achieved in the
Delors II package. Given the agreement reached on future financing and the
prospects for early ratification of the treaty on European union by all
member states, the European Council agreed that enlargement negotiations
will start with Austria, Sweden and Finland at the beginning of 1993.
The European Council invited the Council of Ministers to take decisions on
the opening of negotiations on the same basis with Norway as soon as the
Commission's opinion on its application is available. Negotiations will to
the extent possible be conducted in parallel.
Promoting economic recovery in Europe: The European Council discussed the
prospects for growth and the rise in unemployment. On the internal market,
the European Council noted with particular satisfaction. . . the programme
will in all essential respects be successfully completed by December 31,
1992. This is a historic moment for the Community, marking the fulfilment of
one of the fundamental objectives of the Treaty of Rome.
Free movement of persons: The European Council has had to take note of the
fact that free movement within the Community. . . cannot be assured on
January 1, 1993. The work necessary to achieve this result without creating
dangers for public security and compromising the fight against illegal
immigration, although having progressed, is still under way. However,
noticeable changes benefiting travellers will occur during the course of
next year.
Migration: Deeply concerned by the intensification of episodes of
intolerance, which it has strongly condemned, the European Council has
underlined that there must be no room for racism and xenophobia in today's
Europe, and has reiterated its determination to oppose such attitudes with
renewed vigour.
Size of the European parliament: The European Council agreed. . . the
following number of members of the parliament, from 1994, to reflect German
unification and in the perspective of enlargement: Belgium 25, Denmark 16,
Germany 99, Greece 25, Spain 64, France 87, Ireland 15, Italy 87, Luxembourg
6, Netherlands 31, Portugal 25, United Kingdom 87. Total 567.
Former Soviet Union: The European Council welcomes the start of negotiations
with Russia on a partnership and co-operation agreement and looks forward to
swift progress in negotiations with the other states.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Monday Interview: Keynesian in from the cold - Cambridge
economist Wynne Godley talks to Peter Marsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six months ago the notion of Mr Norman Lamont turning for policy ideas to
Professor Wynne Godley - long-time critic of the Tory government and
arch-dissident of UK economics - would have seemed fantastic.
So it is a measure of how far the government's approach has changed since
sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in mid-September
that Prof Godley was named last week as a member of a new seven-strong panel
of economists set up by the Treasury to advise the chancellor.
The 66-year-old Cambridge economist - and one-time Treasury forecaster and
professional oboe player - is probably Britain's best-known Keynesian
economist. Ever since he entered academic life in 1970, he has made himself
unpopular with UK free-market economists and politicians by calling for
strong government intervention, especially to strengthen Britain's
manufacturing base.
Prof Godley is often described by fellow economists as a doomsayer. He has
warned continuously since the mid-1970s that unless Britain takes action to
increase manufactured exports and reduce imports, its big trade deficit will
produce structural imbalances that will lead to long recessions and high
unemployment.
His intense blue eyes, shock of white hair and stooping gait give Prof
Godley the appearance of a biblical prophet. He has certainly been in the
wilderness.
During the mid-1980s, Prof Godley's ideas were distinctly out of favour
owing to the widespread feeling that Britain had solved many of its economic
problems as a result of the free-market approach of Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher.
But in the past two years, as Britain has stumbled into its longest
recession since the 1930s, the professor has come back into fashion.
Today, his prescriptions for state action to promote recovery fit in with
the mood both of a recession-weary Britain, and of a government willing to
try new approaches after the ERM debacle and the Treasury's stream of
incorrect forecasts about an upturn.
Indeed, some of the measures announced by Mr Lamont in last month's Autumn
Statement to promote growth - such as the effort to boost factory investment
and the housing market by tax incentives and purchases of empty houses -
could have been lifted straight from Prof Godley's list of ideas for an
upturn.
As early as October 1989, Prof Godley warned that the UK was on track for a
'major recession of which the incidence will be random, unjust and
destructive'. In March last year, he was the only mainstream economist bold
enough to predict, correctly, that UK output would fall both in 1991 and
1992.
These forecasts were to some degree repeats of other gloomy predictions by
Prof Godley made over the past 20 years. Back in 1982, he warned that
unemployment would exceed 4m by the end of the decade - a prediction that
does not appear too inaccurate given that today's jobless figure is almost
3m and climbing.
Seated on a couch in his study at King's College - his Steinway piano on one
side of the room and his Elonex computer used for forecasting in the centre
 -Prof Godley explains his view of economics. He says governments must take
responsibility for social goals such as high levels of employment, a fair
system to distribute income and 'ensuring that people who are ill or old or
very poor are cared for'.
He rejects free-market Thatcherite economics as both unjust and giving the
wrong picture of how economies work. He says the most important part of
modern economies is not millions of people working as free agents but
institutions such as governments, companies, banks and trade unions which
operate in a number of unique ways and cannot be fitted into 'dangerous and
pernicious' theories about free choice.
Given his view that markets are rarely free, he says governments have a duty
to intervene where appropriate in a way that is 'benevolent, unifying and
deliberate'. He says: 'Until the mid-1970s it was common ground among decent
people that this is how governments should operate. The Thatcherite
contribution was to tear this notion to pieces.'
As for trade, Prof Godley says: 'A basic premise is that Britain needs a
strong manufacturing base to generate the income to pay for imports. It is
insanity to say the balance of payments doesn't matter.'
He is among many non-government economists worried that even in a recession
the UK's deficit on visible goods is heading for Pounds 14bn this year, and
could climb to Pounds 19.5bn next year on the Treasury's latest forecast.
The need to fund the deficit mainly by borrowing from overseas will, says
Prof Godley, be one of the factors keeping the UK economy weak. He reckons
output next year will show only the mildest improvement, with growth of 0.5
per cent and with unemployment moving up to 3.3m.
During the heady days of the mid-1980s, Prof Godley stuck to his guns,
warning that the credit explosion would fizzle out and end in a downturn as
businesses and consumers cut their spending once they had realised they had
overborrowed. 'There was a yuppie culture in Cambridge at the time and my
view led to some difficult moments when talking to students,' he says.
His views have also prompted disagreements with fellow economists. Sir
Douglas Hague, a former economics adviser to Mrs Thatcher, says Prof Godley
has been 'too pessimistic, and wrong'. Lord Skidelsky, an economics
professor at Warwick University who is also Keynes's biographer, says: 'Prof
Godley is an interesting maverick, not a high-powered thinker. Keynes was
always concerned with what is possible: Godley is not very practical and
this has reduced his influence.'
Somewhat warmer is Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University - one
of Britain's leading free-market economists who, like Prof Godley, has also
strongly criticised the government and is another member of the Treasury's
new advisory panel. Although Prof Minford thinks the Cambridge don
'sometimes goes over the top' in rejecting market mechanisms, he admits he
has 'a lot of respect for him'.
Whatever the views of colleagues, Prof Godley now has the ear of the
Treasury. So what will he tell the Treasury's new advisory committee at its
first meeting early next year? Prof Godley wants interest rates cut
immediately from 7 per cent to 5 per cent, along with a further devaluation
of the pound of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent to add to the 11 per
cent depreciation which has taken place since the ERM exit. If inflation
started to get out of control, he would damp demand by increasing taxes.
He says import controls, which he espoused during the 1970s, are now
'unthinkable'. But he would like to see the Department of Trade and Industry
taking 'strong, ingenious and partisan' measures to boost industrial output,
through modest ideas such as tax incentives for investment or setting
technical standards.
Aren't such thoughts, even in a fairly diluted form, a throwback to the bad
old days of Labour-style state involvement in industry? Prof Godley says he
does not want the government to tell industry what to do, but to work with
it. He thinks Labour's economics policies 'pretty feeble'. He has never
joined Labour, nor any other political group, and describes himself as a
'one nation Tory'.
While some have suggested that the Treasury's new advisory panel is no more
than a device to neutralise criticism of the Treasury, Prof Godley is
optimistic. 'With good will and forbearance, it could be a very creative
piece of machinery,' he says.
As for his general views about Britain's future, Prof Godley says he wants
to lay to rest that he is an incurable pessimist. 'Britain is full of so
many talented people. Given the right combination of carrots and sticks,
things can be supremely better than they are.'

FT  14 DEC 92 / The sternest test is healthcare: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Social reform in the US occurs in fits and starts. In the 1930s Franklin
Roosevelt introduced unemployment insurance and federal pensions. In the
1960s, Lyndon Johnson attacked racial discrimination and poverty. In the
1990s, Mr Bill Clinton faces a task of comparable dimensions: reform of
healthcare to ensure universal coverage and better control of costs. He took
his first step last week in nominating Ms Donna Shalala, an energetic
university chancellor, as health secretary.
Ms Shalala inherits a fluid situation. Following Mr Clinton's election
victory, two of the parties most resistant to change - the private insurance
industry and the American Medical Association - have made conciliatory
noises. They have done so in part because a seductively attractive reform
strategy, known as 'managed competition', is rapidly gaining popularity. The
socially liberal New York Times has been running hectoring editorials in
favour of the reform for months. Yet conservative groups are also
supportive.
The need for reform can hardly be overstated. After decades of uncontrolled
expansion, healthcare now accounts for 14 per cent of gross domestic
product; it is the biggest 'industry' in the US, more significant for the
economy than all exports combined. Relentless healthcare inflation is the
main cause of structural budget deficits. Yet despite all this spending 35m
or so people remain uninsured. Millions more are reluctant to change jobs
for fear of losing health coverage, or getting less generous benefits; a
serious illness can still jeopardise future insurance prospects while
anxiety about the exploding cost of nursing home care afflicts even the
affluent.
Could managed competition provide a solution? It depends on what you make
this slippery phrase to mean, whether you lay more stress on managing, or
more on competition. The heart of the idea is sound enough. Unregulated
insurance markets fail for a variety of reasons: private insurers
discriminate against the sick (who are costly to insure) and they often lack
the market power (or incentive) to restrain the expenditure of providers -
the doctors and hospitals.
Managed competition says the answer is to create 'sponsors' - regional
purchasing groups through which individuals would have to buy health plans.
The sponsors, the argument runs, would have the clout to demand high quality
and low prices from competing providers in the private sector. Every plan
would have to offer a minimum set of basic benefits; discrimination against
the sick would be made illegal. As an added pressure on costs, the
deductibility of employer-paid premiums would be limited to the cost of the
cheapest health plan available in a given area.
At first glance all this sounds marvellous. The goals of universal coverage
and cost control are achieved without imposing bureaucratic controls or
sacrificing the flexibility and dynamism of market competition. But then the
questions start pouring in. Even with limits on tax deductibility, is it
likely that the sponsors would effectively restrain healthcare costs, which
are driven by factors such as new technology? In California, which already
has many big purchasing groups, costs are still rising fast.
And how do you ensure everybody gets insurance through one of these
sponsors? If employers are not required to enroll employees, many workers
will continue to plead poverty and fail to enroll themselves. The unemployed
in any case would have to be covered by some kind of catch-all public
scheme. Scratch the surface of managed competition and things get very
messy.
There is a variant of managed competition that might work, put forward by Mr
John Garamendi, California's insurance commissioner. Under his scheme,
private insurance premiums would be replaced by new payroll taxes on
employers and employees. This revenue would be handed over to competing
purchasing units, on the basis of the number of individuals they attract. As
in other schemes, the sponsors would then purchase care from competing
private sector providers. But there would be a real budget constraint
because the sponsors could only spend the tax revenue they received.
By imposing rigorous constraints on the US private sector, Mr Garamendi's
version of managed competition would create a health system not dissimilar
to Britain's National Health Service, where the aim of reforms was to
introduce competition into a public sector system. In both cases the theory
is that tax-financed purchasing groups buy care on behalf of patients from
independent, competing groups of providers. In both cases there is a safety
valve in that, having paid health taxes, people are free to buy extra
private care if they so choose.
In the US, the biggest obstacles are the institutional upheaval involved and
the fact that replacing private insurance premiums by payroll taxes would
sharply increase the tax burden - without, of course, raising the financial
burden imposed on the economy by healthcare. International experience,
however, suggests weaker forms of managed competition would not achieve the
twin goals of cost control and universal coverage. A Garamendi-style reform
would be a huge step for Americans. But this may just be one of those rare
moments in US history when huge steps are possible.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Nation unto nation: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The negotiations between Denmark and the other 11 member states, over a
document which could enable the Danes to hold a second referendum on the
Maastricht treaty, have caused a lot of bother and barney. Scandalised
sticklers for juridical integrity have protested that it must be quite
improper to offer a deal which lets the Danes opt out of the main provisions
of the treaty, even before it has begun. World-weary cynics retort that the
treaty is an infinitely elastic document which can be stretched in any
direction; the only important thing is to ratify it, because we can always
adjust the fine print later.
There is one issue, however, over which there surely could be no serious
argument, and that is the question of European citizenship. One of the
reasons a narrow majority of the Danish electorate voted against Maastricht
last June, we are told, was that they were afraid the new Treaty of European
Union would take away their Danish citizenship. This may seem strange, even
incredible. But it can be no great sacrifice of European Community principle
for the other member states to reassure the Danish people that their fears
are groundless.
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the text batted back and forth
between the 12 included an article which solemnly declared that the European
'citizenship' referred to in the new treaty did not replace national
citizenship. It would confer additional rights and protections, but
nationality as such would continue to be the sole prerogative of the
national member states. Such a declaration may seem unnecessary, it may even
seem childish, but at least it could do no harm to tell the truth.
At first blush, the moral of this minor aspect of the Danish dilemma is that
those Danish politicians who were campaigning for ratification did a
peculiarly incompetent job of explaining the treaty to the people. It makes
one wonder if they know what they are talking about now.
At another level, however, Danish anxieties undoubtedly touch indirectly on
a nexus of politically sensitive questions which are likely to become of
intense relevance in the future. The Maastricht treaty could not affect the
essentially national character of the attribution of citizenship, because it
would not displace the leading role of the nation state as the primary
paradigm of political legitimacy. The locus of political authority must be
the locus of nationality.
On the other hand, there is a raft of associated issues that are almost as
sensitive, which will force their way on to the European agenda not mainly
through the Maastricht treaty, but through the combined effect of outside
pressures and the opening-up of the single European market. Following the
collapse of the Berlin Wall and the war in ex-Yugoslavia, the Community has
already started to recognise that the refugee problem is so large and so
serious that it needs the beginnings of a common European response. The
Maastricht treaty would take the Community into the field of normal travel
regulation, in the realm of visa policy.
Given the potential migratory pressures which exist to the east of the
Community and to the south, the member states may be forced sooner or later
to consider whether they must move in the direction of a common immigration
policy. In principle, this might not be an issue of serious contention,
since they all try to bolt the door tight shut; but in practice they all
suffer more or less from illegal immigration, so there could be matter for
co-operation in policing and detection.
At that point, they may then be only a small step away from talking about
the implications for immigration of their different asylum and nationality
policies.
In fact, in the context of the Single European Act, with completely free
movement for Community 'citizens' and no border controls (on the Continent),
it is difficult to see how they can avoid talking about their different
nationality policies. This issue is particularly acute in the case of
Germany, which has acquired a large number of new citizens as a result of
unification, and which regularly acquires large numbers of other ethnic
Germans previously settled in eastern Europe or the ex-Soviet Union. These
changes in the German population are causing serious social stress inside
the country; the unknown question is whether free movement in the Community
could lead to stress in other countries.
Insofar as there is a single problem, it is that Germany has an exclusively
ethnic basis for the attribution of nationality: a German is someone with
German parents. This policy, crystallised in the nationality law of 1913,
originated in the 18th and 19th centuries, when frontiers were shifting
between the German lands and the Slav lands of Poland, Lithuania and the
Ukraine; Germans felt their nation existed before their state had been
created.
France has a different history and therefore a different nationality policy.
Its essential frontiers were fixed relatively early by a strong central
state; indeed, while the German nation created the German state, the French
state created the French nation. Partly for this reason, and partly because
of a historically low birth rate, France has long had a law of nationality
conferred by birth in France as well as by birth to French parents. As a
result, about one-fifth of its population has a parent or grandparent who
was an immigrant.
These national characteristics have historic roots which go far too deep to
be swept away in the name of European uniformity. Neither the Germans nor
the French can deny the facts of their differences; but nor can they deny
that these differences may have policy consequences for their neighbours in
the Community.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Pressure on franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION within the European exchange rate mechanism is set to continue this
week with several currencies coming under pressure in spite of the
agreements reached at the Edinburgh summit, writes Peter John.
The three ERM currencies causing concern at the moment are the Irish punt,
the Danish krone and the French franc.
Of the three, the punt is seen as most vulnerable and selling on Friday
prompted Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, to stress his
commitment to its present value. However, a number of London economists
argue that there is no way that it can escape devaluation.
The krone, which was said to have been hit by corporate selling at the end
of last week, is strongly expected to tread the devaluation path of its its
Scandinavian colleagues.
There is more debate about the fate of the French franc. Belief is growing
that if it is not devalued, floated or temporarily suspended from the ERM
this week, it will have maintained its position by only the slimmest of
margins and will probably go within the next few weeks.
Francophiles argue on the other hand that the economic fundamentals in
France are sound and the currency benefits from a strong political and
economic commitment to the status quo by the French government and arguably
by the Bundesbank. They add that it is the key currency to stand against the
D-Mark and if there is any realignment the whole nature of the mechanism
comes under question.
In the money markets, short term rates are expected to be squeezed higher as
the clearing banks find it preferable to borrow money overnight rather than
take the Bank of England offers which can entail carrying money over into
the New Year and upsetting the year end balance sheets.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Risk and Reward: Place your bets on the Bundesbank's next
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL European interest rates fail to drop as fast next year as forward
prices in the money markets predict? Or will they fall faster? Whichever the
outcome, a rash of structured products is currently on offer for investors
who want to gear up their bets on what the Bundesbank does next.
Betting on the speed of European interest rate cuts has been a popular game
from New York to Tokyo for more than a year now. Following the September
mayhem in currency markets, though, activity has picked up in recent weeks.
Earlier this year, US investors were driven by a desire to earn high
European-style interest rates at a time when US rates were low. The 'diff
swap', which enables them to swap a US income stream for a European-style
one, was one answer. Now, though, they are more interested in how to benefit
from the falling differential between interest rates in the two continents.
Structured notes issued by banks are one answer - particularly for US or
Japanese investors who want to avoid the risks of holding European
currencies. Returns to the investor are tied to the change in the
differential between US and European interest rates over the next year. For
instance, the spread between US and German six-month Libor is nearly 500
basis points at present, while the markets expect the gap to have narrowed
to a little over 100 basis points by the end of 1993. Goldman Sachs, one of
the US banks in London to sell structured notes, predicts that the spread a
year from now will stand at 360 basis points.
It therefore recommends a note that pays out a premium if the gap does not
narrow to less than, say, 250 basis points. If the markets are right, of
course, and the gap narrows faster than this, anyone buying such a note
could quickly see their investment being eaten into.
Yield curve bets like these could be constructed by investors from scratch,
avoiding the investment banks' own profit margin, though for all but the
biggest that may prove difficult or expensive.
An alternative bet which has been popular among Japanese investors this year
is the reverse floater, says Mr Nick Burge of Nomura International. Normally
issued in small tranches under medium-term note programmes, these
instruments pay a higher yield as interest rates fall. Reverse floaters were
a popular bet on falling Japanese interest rates at the start of this year,
he says, and have now taken hold in European currencies as well.
RENEWED tensions in Europe's exchange rate mechanism in the lead up to the
Edinburgh summit caused some parts of the currency options market to all but
seize up at the end of last week.
Gridlocks like this have become familiar in recent months, ebbing and
flowing with the tide of speculation in the spot foreign exchange markets.
With markets becoming seasonally less liquid anyway as the end of the year
approaches, it seems unlikely that things are likely to get better soon.
'Liquidity in (options on) the smaller ERM currencies has been very thin -
though it has held up quite well in the Pounds /D-Mark,' said Mr Keith
Darlington of ICI's treasury department. Mr Bob Jolly, an associate director
of County NatWest Investment Management, agreed: 'FFr/D-Mark is not being
quoted at all, or is being quoted on massive spreads.'
Volatility for one week FFr/D-Mark options was being quoted on Friday at a
spread of 5-15 per cent: a reflection of the fact that few banks wanted to
write options, since to do so would leave them exposed to any sharp swing in
the exchange rate. For ERM currencies expected to move within narrow
fluctuation bands, these volatility levels showed just how high the pressure
on the franc had risen by the end of last week.
The French currency is not alone. The implied volatility levels used to
price options on most European currencies have been edging higher again in
recent weeks, having slipped back after the traumas of September. This is
not just within the ERM: the three-month volatility of both sterling and the
D-Mark against the Dollars was around 15-16 per cent at the end of last
week.

FT  14 DEC 92 / UK Bonds: Debenture holders face controversial default
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE end of this week the UK debenture market could be faced with a rare
and controversial default, the first such event to spring from the weakening
UK property market.
The case has already prompted many investors to take a closer look at the
state of the assets backing their debentures, as well as the wording of the
covenants covering their lending. And it has brought scrutiny of how well
trustees protect their bond holders' interests.
A Pounds 135m issue from London &amp; Provincial Shop, a subsidiary of
Randsworth Acquisition, which is in receivership, seems likely to be called
into default on Friday, following notice of breach of covenant issued ten
days ago by Law Debenture Corporation, the trustee to the issue.
Law Debenture's reason for issuing its notice - the sale by London &amp;
Provincial in 1990 of a property over which the debenture holders had a
charge - is disputed by the company, which claims it acted in accordance
with the trust deed. These rival views could yet end up in court.
London &amp; Provincial's problems go far beyond this, though. Bondholders were
told earlier this month that a valuation in June of the properties backing
the bonds had shown total assets to be worth only 1.18 times the Pounds 135m
lent, compared with a covenanted agreement that the proportion would not
fall below 1.5 times. Since June, the company estimates, its assets have
fallen further, leaving it with cover of less than 1.1 times.
The company also faces an interest payment to its debenture holders on
January 6. Since its recent announcement of losses of Pounds 4.37m in the
year to June, that payment has been in doubt.
Defaults in the debenture market are few and far between - and even when
they happen, investors are normally repaid in full (as happened when
Rolls-Royce collapsed 20 years ago). In the past 30 years, only the Prince
of Wales Dry Dock in Swansea and Mitchell Construction are thought to have
left their debenture holders out of pocket.
That helps to account for the tight spread on which debentures trade: MEPC's
secured bonds, for instance, trade at a spread of about 110 basis points
over gilts, compared with the 220 basis point spread of MEPC's unsecured
debt - a difference of 110 basis points. For the strongest credits in the
property sector, like Land Securities, the difference is around 55 basis
points.
The rarity of the situation has prompted debenture investors - mainly
insurance companies - to scrutinise their portfolios with renewed interest.
So far only Dares Estates, a property investment and development group which
is seeking a financial restructuring, has been put on the official sick
list.
The London &amp; Provincial case has aroused investors' passions for other
reasons too. Despite the lack of adequate asset cover, no formal valuation
of the properties has been done under the terms of the debenture's trust
deed (the June valuation came from the company's own advisers). Only after a
formal valuation, and a further six-month period to allow the company to top
up the asset cover, would the bondholders be able to call a breach of
covenant.
Some investors feel the trustee to the issue, Law Debenture, has failed to
protect their interests. Six months ago, a substantial proportion of the
holders asked the trustee to order a formal valuation, only to have their
request rejected.
Mr David Norris of Law Debenture still stands by that decision: an attempt
by a receiver to sell London &amp; Provincial in full could have been harmed by
such a move, if it revealed a low valuation, he says. Also, since the
debentures do not mature until well into the next century, it seemed logical
to react to a short-term fall in the property market by starting a series of
actions which could lead to a technical default. Investors he spoke to
afterwards agreed with the reasoning, says Mr Norris.
He adds that London &amp; Provincial highlights one of the hazards of being a
trustee: you are condemned if you act, and condemned if you do not. Others,
though, claim the case raises more important questions. How well do trustees
exercise their discretion - and are there other situations where they have
effectively turned a blind eye to potential breaches of covenants,
potentially to the detriment of investors?
THERE is a view abroad in the City that another corner of the domestic
sterling bond markets is about to spring into life. Judging by a significant
shift in their financing costs, UK local authorities should soon return to
the capital markets after a decade-long absence.
The overall picture is clear from figures prepared by Baring Sterling Bonds.
In 1981, local authorities had more than Pounds 2bn in bonds and loan stocks
outstanding. By last year, that had fallen to under Pounds 300m. Authorities
could borrow more cheaply from the Public Works Loan Board, which itself is
funded through gilt issuance, so why turn to the markets?
That picture has changed markedly. PWLB lending counts towards the UK's
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, so rates have been pushed up to
dissuade authorities from tapping the public purse. That effectively forces
them into a form of public sector off-balance sheet finance - borrowings
direct from banks or the bond markets.
This phenomenon isn't restricted to the UK, but is becoming familiar across
Europe as national fiscal positions deteriorate.
Why, then, hasn't there already been a stampede of authorities to the
sterling bond market? In part, perhaps, because the markets need time to
reacquaint themselves with the authorities. In the 10 years since they were
last big borrowers, the Hammersmith &amp; Fulham swaps case and a substantial
shift in the relationship between central and local government have
occurred.
Also, authorities tend to move in unison. It seems unlikely that a single
authority would move alone, without first having sounded out others: and
some authorities may be concerned that, for political reasons, their names
are not strong enough to demand an instant following. Logic suggests,
though, that the authorities will appear before long.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Japanese Bonds: Tankan prompts hope of rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of an imminent cut in the official discount rate re-emerged on Friday
following the release of the latest tankan, the Bank of Japan's quarterly
survey of business confidence.
The report made it clear that the Japanese economy is facing one of the most
severe post-war downturns. It could well prompt a further fall in short term
money market rates and a steepening of the yield curve.
The yield on the No 145 10-year government bond closed at 4.595 per cent on
Friday. With most bond market participants on the sidelines ahead of the
year-end, the yield has ranged between 4.58 per cent and 4.63 per cent over
the past month.
The central bank's report indicated that business confidence among 6,874
businesses fell to a 16-year low, with confidence among manufacturers
falling to minus 44, its lowest level since 1976, and non-manufacturers
minus 27, down from minus 13 in August.
The sluggish economy was confirmed in third-quarter GNP figures announced
earlier this month. Japan's economy fell an annualised 1.6 per cent from the
previous quarter. Traders point out that while the next cut for the official
discount rate is already discounted in bond prices, the move could prompt a
rally in response to hopes of a further credit easing.
Although the Bank of Japan denies the possibility of an imminent discount
rate cut, some investors remain hopeful the central bank may repeat last
year's move, when it eased credit on December 30.
A further fall in short term rates would be favourable for the long bond
market, and for corporate issuers, who need to raise funds as equity-linked
bonds, launched at the peak of the market, come to maturity.
Mr Marshall Gittler, fixed income analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, says
institutions are facing a problem in finding low risk high yielding
instruments to place funds, causing a lack of investors willing to sell.
On the middle to longer term, however, a deluge of corporate issues could
pose problems over the next year, where some Y10,000bn of equity-linked
issues are expected to mature. Corporate registrations for issuances within
the next two years with the Ministry of Finance have risen to around Y7,000.
Most companies seem to be waiting for interest rates to bottom, and
investors may face a surge in new issues during the first and second
quarters of next year.
According to Merrill Lynch, Japan's private sector debt is currently equal
to over 200 per cent of GDP and the net return on capital is around the
lowest level for ten years.
Under such circumstances, the Bank of Japan is expected to keep rates low to
maintain low-cost short term financing.

FT  14 DEC 92 / US Money and Credit: Optimism at Clinton appointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton, whose economic and fiscal policy utterances
will dominate US credit market sentiment for months to come, saw his own
credit rise several notches on a suspicious Wall Street last week as he
announced his team of economic advisers.
The appointments gave Wall Street the most tangible indications yets of the
likely economic priorities of a Clinton administration. And the credit
markets, which generally associate Democratic administrations with the twin
sins of increased government spending and inflation, were partially
reassured by the politically centrist team they saw.
The market's over-riding fear is that the Clinton administration, committed
during the election campaign to jump-starting the (then) ailing US economy,
will go for an excessive fiscal stimulus early next year, just when US
growth seems to be gathering momentum. The result could be renewed
inflationary fears and a slump in bond prices.
The market's hope is that Mr Clinton, whose campaign pledges also included
action to cut the federal budget deficit, will energetically apply himself
to this goal, which would be positive for bond prices.
The membership of the Clinton economic team gives grounds for optimism not
just that the emphasis will be on deficit reduction, but that the
administration may be able to get genuine change through the
Democrat-dominated Congress, which its Republican predecessor failed to do.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new treasury secretary, knows Congressional fiscal
policy-making inside out thanks to his many years as chairman of the Senate
finance committee. Representative Leon Panetta, the new director of the
Office of Management and Budget, has long been a strong advocate of deficit
reduction.
Wall Street sceptics suggest the appointment of Congressional insiders could
make Mr Clinton a prisoner of a free-spending Capitol Hill, but the
president-elect's finely tuned political instincts seem more likely to
produce the very opposite effect.
As Mr Edward Yardeni, chief economist at securities firm CJ Lawrence, points
out, Mr Clinton wants to get re-elected in 1996, and the strong showing of
Mr Ross Perot during last autumn's campaign shows the electorate is deeply
concerned about the deficit.
He adds: 'The big surprise over the next few months could be that Clinton's
multi-year economic proposals will have much less short-term fiscal stimulus
and much more deficit reduction than widely expected.'
Certainly, the latest statistics suggest that the economy is now recovering
sufficiently robustly not to need a sharp stimulus. Last Friday brought word
of a better-than-expected jump in November retail sales and a big rise in
consumer confidence.
The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book on economic conditions points to a
modest but uneven improvement and the central bank seems certain to keep
monetary policy on hold when its Open Markets Committee meets on December
22.
At the same time, inflationary pressures remain very subdued. The consumer
price index for November, released on Friday, saw a modest two-tenths of a
per cent rise, just what Wall Street had been expecting.
The net effect of these various forces last week was to leave long bond
prices modestly higher on the week, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year
issue dropping from 7.48 per cent to 7.43 per cent. A rally early in the
week on news of the political appointments was partly offset in the latter
half by the good economic figures.
The great unknown remains the economic package Mr Clinton will unveil in the
early weeks of his presidency. The market was unsettled by his recent
remarks - albeit made well before last week's cabinet appointments -
suggesting that the recovery may not be all that robust.
But each fresh batch of statistics suggests otherwise, and could open up for
Mr Clinton a golden opportunity for deficit reduction. Long bond prices
might then rally, producing a substantially flatter yield curve as short
term rates trended upwards in response to recovery.

FT  14 DEC 92 / UK Gilts: Prices buoyed by news on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILT prices were buoyed by better than expected news on inflation, although
a continuation of the obdurate stance by the Bundesbank on interest rates
reduced demand for short-dated bonds.
In thin trading, prices for the UK securities mainly moved sideways. However
on Friday gilts moved up by 1 point at one stage on news that the retail
price index rose by just 3 per cent in the 12 months to November, its lowest
year-on-year increase in six years.
A day earlier, the Bundesbank council, as expected, failed to cut its
interest rates due to continuing worries about high German inflation sparked
by unification and soaring government deficits.
The lack of action on German monetary policy lifted the D-Mark against most
European currencies, including the pound. Even though sterling is no longer
formally tied to the D-Mark, Bank of England and Treasury officials are
thought to be extremely nervous about the possibility of the pound falling
much below its current level of around DM2.45.
As a result officials are expected not to want to run the risk of the pound
falling by sanctioning any further reduction in base rates, now 7 per cent.
While short-term interest rates in the UK appear to be unlikely to see any
imminent changes, investor interest in purchasing short dated gilts is
expected to be lukewarm.
As well as worrying about the level of the pound, the Bank and the Treasury
are also thought to be cautious about sanctioning a further cut in base
rates on the grounds that there are small signs of a pick-up in economic
activity.
Many politicians and industrialists would welcome a further cut in UK rates,
which have come down by 3 percentage points since September when Britain
left the European exchange rate mechanism. But before deciding on any
further action on interest rates government officials will probably want to
wait for further news as to how overall UK demand might have increased as a
result of the easing in economic policy since sterling's devaluation.
With yields for short-maturing securities pushed up a fraction last week by
the lack of strong expectations about base rate cuts in the near future, the
focus switched to the longer end of the yield curve. Gilts in this part of
the bond spectrum held out some attraction for investors, particularly after
Friday's inflation news.
This class of securities saw some buying pressure after the inflation
numbers showed the continuing weakness of demand at the retail level in the
UK, a development likely to be good for gilts over the next few months. The
year on year increase in the RPI in November - the headline number - showed
a big decrease on the corresponding figure in the year to October of 3.6 per
cent.
Meanwhile, the Treasury's favoured measure of underlying inflation - the RPI
less mortgage interest payments - saw a fall from 3.8 per cent in the 12
months to October to 3.6 per cent in the year to last month. That is a
further sign that growth in the UK economy next year is likely to be weak, a
factor that can be expected to boost demand for long-dated gilts.
According to Mr Don Smith, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, figures for UK
inflation are likely to be exceptionally important for the gilt market over
the next few months, ahead of any surge in prices of imported goods sparked
by sterling's devaluation.
Emphasising the message that underlying inflation is continuing to fall
rapidly, an index compiled by Greenwell Montagu of 'core inflation' fell
from a year-on-year 3.4 per cent in October to a figure of just 3.1 per cent
in November. In September the number had been 3.7 per cent.
The fall in the core index - which is the RPI, excluding not only mortgage
payments but prices of petrol, seasonal food, electricity, gas and other
items deemed to be subject to erratic price variations - is a further
indication of extremely weak demand for many classes of retail goods caused
by the lingering recession.

FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Setback for Israeli bank sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Israeli government's faltering attempts to sell its majority
shareholdings in the country's four leading banks have suffered a setback
with the collapse at the weekend of an agreement to sell Bank Mizrahi to Mr
Gad Ze'evi, an Israeli businessman.
The collapse leaves the government without any clear strategy for the sale
of the banks - the other three are Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi and Israel
Discount Bank - with only 10 months to go until an effective deadline for
their privatisation.
Any bank unsold by October 1993 will fall under direct state control under
the terms of the government's rescue of the banking system following a share
collapse in 1983. The state spent Dollars 7bn buying up the majority of the
banks' shares, but left management with the original owners under a
preferential share system.
Once sold, the government's shareholdings will have equal voting rights,
taking the banks back into full private ownership. But the failure to divest
by next October could lead to full nationalisation, just as the government
is trying to reduce the state's role in the economy.
Mr Ze'evi, who already owns the small Maritime Bank, agreed earlier this
year to buy a 51 per cent stake in Bank Mizrahi, previously owned by the
World Mizrahi religious movement, for Dollars 185m. But the Bank of Israel
and the US Federal Reserve Board, which had to approve the sale of Bank
Mizrahi's US subsidiary, delayed issuing Mr Ze'evi the necessary banking
permits.
One dispute arose over Mr Ze'evi's intention subsequently to sell some of
the holding to other investors. He demanded the Bank of Israel issue him a
permit by last Friday, but it refused.
The government's strategy of placing through private tenders controlling
stakes in the banks appears now to be in tatters. It had already been
virtually discounted for Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi, the two biggest
banks, because of their size. The likeliest alternative is large-scale
flotations on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pacific Telesis to split itself
into two
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Telesis, the California-based local telephone company, is to split
itself in two under plans to spin off the company's wireless communications
business.
The move, a unique departure by a 'Baby Bell' regional telephone company, is
aimed at taking advantage of the increasingly competitive US and
international telecommunications markets.
Mr Sam Ginn, chairman of the group, told the Financial Times that the move
signalled the company 'intends to be a world competitor in wireless
telecommunications,' taking advantage of global privatisation trends.
Pacific Telesis is to spin off its wireless business, which has annual sales
of around Dollars 1bn, into a company separate from its local telephone
operations, which serve most of California and large parts of neighbouring
Nevada and have a turnover around Dollars 9bn.
The US local telephone market is slow growing, highly regulated and, while
still essentially a monopoly, subject to increasing competition for business
customers. The wireless communications market is lightly regulated and
growing extremely rapidly, both in the US and other developed countries.
Pacific Telesis is one of the largest providers of cellular telephone
services in the US and also has a sizeable paging business and a fledgling
vehicle tracking operation. It has cellular operations in Germany, Portugal
and Japan, and other wireless interests in France, Spain, Thailand and South
Korea.
The spin-off, expected to take about a year, is the biggest structural
change by one of the seven 'Baby Bells' since their creation in 1984, when
AT&amp;T was forced to spin off its local operations in a court-ordered
anti-trust settlement.
Mr Ginn said the creation of two separately traded companies should mean
better value for shareholders, since financial markets tended to place a
higher value on single focus organisations.
The wireless company will be known as Pactel Corp and will raise about
Dollars 750m of new equity during the spin off, which will involve a
tax-free distribution of the parent company's stake to existing
shareholders.
Pactel will be headed by 55-year-old Mr Ginn, while the new chairman of
Pacific Telesis will be Mr Phil Quigley, 50, president of its Californian
phone company, Pacific Bell.
Mr Ginn said the split would give Pactel greater ability to raise capital
and attract partners in overseas ventures. It may also give it a greater
chance to acquire licences in the US for a second generation of mobile
telephones, known as personal communications services, which the US
government intends to license over the next few year. The Federal
Communications Commission has indicated a bias against giving these licences
to companies which already hold cellular licences in a particular area.
Mr Ginn said Pactel could enter the long-distance market itself or contract
for the services of existing suppliers. AT&amp;T, the leading US long-distance
carrier, itself underlined the growing links between the two markets last
month when it announced plans to take a 33 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular,
the largest US cellular carrier.
Mr Ginn added that while Pactel had no manufacturing ambitions, it may wish
to take an equity stake in an equipment company as part of the development
of its services.

PFIZER, one of the fastest-growing US drugs groups, is to increase its
annual research and development spending to more than Dollars 1bn next year.
Mr Henry McKinnel, chief financial officer, said the aim was to increase the
percentage of group sales from pharmaceuticals. During the first nine months
of this year drugs generated 62 per cent of its Dollars 5.28bn sales
compared with 54 per cent last year.
Mr McKinnel said the group would limit price rises on US prescription drugs
to between 2 per cent and 3 per cent in the coming year. The announcement
follows growing political pressure from Congress to limit price increases. A
number of other groups, including Merck, the largest US drugs company, have
undertaken not to raise prices or at least limit them to the rate of
inflation.
The promise to increase investment in research and development by up to 20
per cent next year follows an 18 per cent rise to Dollars 756.8m in 1991.
The investment is designed to help the group counter the expiry of patents.

FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Australia faces an identity
crisis - The growing level of foreign ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Picture a typical Australian. He wears an Akubra hat and Drizabone raincoat,
drives a Holden car, and lunches off Vegemite sandwiches washed down with
Castlemaine XXXX beer or a glass of Jacob's Creek wine.
Many Australians would see such a 'typical Aussie' as a caricature. But most
would also regard the locally-made products as cultural icons, each of which
expresses something about what it means to be Australian.
Yet only Akubra is Australian owned. Holden and Vegemite are US-owned,
Castlemaine is run from New Zealand, Drizabone is British, and Jacob's
Creek, part of the Orlando Wyndham group, is French.
These are not isolated cases. More than half of the Australian beer industry
is foreign-controlled, as is about 70 per cent of processed food production,
90 per cent of daily newspaper circulation, and much of the wine industry.
The Labor government has taken a relaxed view of the growing level of
foreign ownership, arguing that each case should be dealt with on its
merits. The Foreign Investment Review Board approves 95 per cent of
applications from overseas companies to acquire stakes of more than 15 per
cent in Australian companies.
But concern about the level of foreign ownership is beginning to emerge
among economic nationalists such as Mr Harry Palmer, president of the
Australian Owned Companies Association, who wants a ban on further foreign
acquisitions. Most attention is focused on a gradual restructuring of the
food industry, which analysts say could leave Australia without a single
locally-owned major manufacturer.
The most recent deal is a ADollars 430m (Dollars 296.8m) offer by United
Biscuits of the UK for the snacks business of Coca-Cola Amatil, which will
transfer 56 per cent of the Australian snacks market to British hands.
The deal is not typical because the snacks business is in effect being
transferred from one foreign owner to another - CCA is itself 51 per cent
owned by Coca-Cola, the US drinks company.
However, Mr Jonathan Rabinovitz, food industry analyst at Potter Warburg
Securities, says it provides a good illustration of the three main driving
forces behind the restructuring.
These are: shedding of non-core businesses by companies which expanded their
product mix in the 1980s; expansion of core food activities by the major
manufacturers; and growing international interest in Australia and New
Zealand as a base for building business in the rapidly expanding Asian
market.
Mr Rabinovitz says the deal allows CCA to concentrate on its profitable
beverage bottling business, while adding to the core business of UB by
delivering market leadership in an important regional market.
UB has also made clear that it sees the deal as an opportunity to establish
an Asia-Pacific bridgehead from which to compete with PepsiCo, the US soft
drinks company, with which it is battling for worldwide market share.
Some of the same driving forces can be identified in other recent food
industry developments, including:
The NZDollars 566m (Dollars 292.6m) purchase by Heinz, the US food group, of
the Wattie food business in New Zealand from Goodman Fielder Wattie. Mr Tony
O'Reilly, Heinz chairman, has made clear that he plans to use Wattie's
efficient plants to attack the Asian market.
GFW's ADollars 330m acquisition of the Uncle Toby's food group in Australia
as part of its attempt to become the biggest manufacturer of cereal-based
branded food products in the Asia/Pacific region.
The acquisition by Pacific Dunlop of the Petersville Sleigh brands from the
collapsed Adsteam group, formerly controlled by Mr John Spalvins. Pacific
Dunlop already has a strong presence in Asia/Pacific markets.
The battle for control of Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, for which
Campbell Soup of the US is bidding ADollars 8.80 a share, valuing the group
at ADollars 1.2bn. Campbell wants to use Arnotts to spearhead a major sales
drive in Asia.
Arnotts has rejected the bid, and is basing its defence partly on an appeal
to the FIRB to prevent ownership passing overseas, which it claims will
involve no advantages in terms of technology or marketing skills.
Mr Rabinovitz says the strong attraction of Australia to international
companies, combined with the relative weakness of the surviving
locally-owned companies, suggests the Campbell bid is likely to be 'just the
beginning of the ultimate domination of the food sector' by multi-nationals.
'First, the low probability of successfully tackling the multinationals head
on is unlikely to justify the risks . . . of going it alone offshore without
an alliance with a strong and already established multi-national.
'Second, on their home front, Australian food companies (will) face a tough
trading environment as the multi-nationals increase their already strong
grip on the domestic market,' he says.
Mr Rabinovitz suggests that the milling group Defiance Mills and the
dairy-based companies National Foods and QUF Industries are prime candidates
for takeover by one of the larger global players.
GFW, the largest food business in Australasia, is better protected, but has
performed poorly in recent years and faces limited domestic growth
opportunities.
'It makes eminent sense for GFW to seek a strategic alliance with one or
more multinational food groups in the future. Alternatively, (it) may prove
attractive to a major food group seeking to bolster its own core
operations,' he says.
Much may depend on the outcome of the Arnotts battle. The final decision on
whether to allow the bid to proceed will be taken by Mr John Dawkins, the
federal treasurer, who has said he will take into account Campbell's ability
to assist Arnotts in increasing sales to Asia.
That is not the same as saying that the bid will be decided on grounds of
economic nationalism, but it does mean that Campbell will have to convince
Australians that the bid is in the national interest, as well as in
shareholders' interests.

The 100-year-old Vancouver-based chain, with 26 department stores and 33

restructuring plan to be put before creditors by mid-February. It will mean
more store closures and lay-offs.

FT  14 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Provisions could push Tarmac to deeper loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence is emerging of the financial problems facing Tarmac, the
UK's biggest housebuilder. The company is awaiting a management consultancy
report which will add weight to losses forecast by some City analysts for
1992 of some Pounds 200m.
The report, by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, is expected to arrive in the
boardroom within a fortnight. It will concentrate on Tarmac's properties
division, which contributed to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 15.1m in the first
half of this year.
On Friday, the construction group announced the resignation of Mr Tony
Collins, the chief executive of the properties division. Tarmac said at the
time of the interims in September it was scaling back its property side, and
yesterday said Mr Collins, who joined the main board in 1989, would not be
replaced.
A spokesman for the company said of the Coopers analysis; 'It is not
completed yet. The fact that there are going to be provisions is not new but
the Coopers report will quantify those provisions. It is part of the new
chief executive's thorough review of all aspects of the group.'
The impact on the figures depends on whether the write-downs are included
below or above the pre-tax line. Assuming they are above, some analysts
believe the total deficit will be Pounds 200m with the most pessimistic
going for Pounds 300m.
Mr Mike Betts, a building materials and construction analyst with US
investment bank Goldman Sachs, said he expected write-downs on housing and
property to result in Tarmac 'declaring a substantial pre-tax loss this year
of up to Pounds 200m.' That would compare with a 1991 profit of Pounds 21m
after provisions.
In September Tarmac said it was cutting the number of homes it builds by up
to a fifth, pulling out of commercial property development and raising cash
to cut debts by disposals.

FT  14 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Being forced towards more accountability /
A look into the impact on life companies of Standard &amp; Poor's ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE usually staid ranks of the UK's life insurers were shaken into uproar
last week at the attempt by Standard &amp; Poor's, the international
credit-rating agency, to rank them according to their financial strength.
Actuaries and analysts were prepared to accept S&amp;P's central claim that life
office strength has been reduced in the last five years and that solvency
margins will remain permanently lower.
But many attacked the wisdom of classifying individual offices into three
categories on the basis of publicly available information alone.
Falling property values and disappointing equity markets in the last five
years have cut heavily into the assets and reserves of life companies.
Meanwhile, costs of distribution have increased since the Financial Services
Act, 1986, which led insurers to raise commissions and establish costly ties
with building societies and banks. S&amp;P says that many offices are 'suffering
severe expense inefficiencies'.
This has led to widespread falls in the free-asset ratio, the most commonly
used crude measure of strength. This measures the proportion to which an
office's assets exceed its liabilities to policyholders.
Even Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life office and awarded the top
AAA ('Superior') claims-paying rating by S&amp;P, has seen its ratio fall from
22.9 per cent in 1986 to 12.6 per cent in 1990. Over the same period Legal &amp;
General, the UK's fourth largest life insurer and also rated at the highest
level by S&amp;P, has suffered a decline from 30.5 per cent to 13.9 per cent.
Several companies have taken evasive measures to avoid capital strain, by
cutting policyholders' annual bonuses, and by switching from equities and
property into fixed interest securities, which are valued more favourably
under the DTI's stringent solvency requirements.
When this happens, pay-outs to policyholders are hit. This has led to
greatly increased interest in financial strength among the independent
brokers on whom the longest established 'with-profits' offices are dependent
for much of their business. The actuarial calculations involved are
complicated, but several leading independent financial advisers have called
for a simple rating for life office strength.
S&amp;P is bidding to fill this gap in the market, and its importance was
demonstrated by the immediate impact on National Provident Institution, one
of the four companies it described as 'vulnerable'. Within an hour of its
London office opening on Friday, 20 alarmed policyholders had telephoned
asking to cancel policies.
However, it is difficult to classify life offices solely on the basis of
published information and DTI returns, as different actuaries use various
assumptions when valuing liabilities. Changing the assumption on future
interest rates can drastically alter an office's total liabilities.
This means that free-asset ratios and other crude measures can prove
individual offices have weakened, but not necessarily that one office is
stronger than another.
'Information available from published sources can provide only a broad
indication of the relative financial strength of life offices. In
particular, no comparison is meaningful unless full account is taken of the
degree of conservatism inherent in the determination of liabilities since
there is considerable variation between companies,' says R Watson,
consultant actuaries.
All the four companies branded as 'vulnerable' complained they had not been
consulted. NPI, which could be seriously damaged by S&amp;P's rating as most of
its business comes from independent advisers, quickly issued a rebuttal,
supported by R Watson.
Mr Bernard Brindley, NPI's chief actuary, pointed out that it used a
conservative valuation policy - in other words, it assumes future interest
rates will be relatively low at 4 per cent. Meanwhile it has kept 65 per
cent of funds in equities.
This is lower than some offices which have high free- asset ratios, such as
Pearl, with 81 per cent invested in equities, but remains higher than
offices such as Scottish Equitable (43 per cent) and Guardian Assurance,
another to receive an S&amp;P 'vulnerable' rating, with 38 per cent.
Mr Brindley also pointed out that NPI's free-asset ratio was only slightly
lower than those of several other similar-sized offices, and suggested that
singling it out for a 'vulnerable' rating was arbitrary.
S&amp;P's ratings may, therefore, be too blunt an instrument to apply to such a
complex topic.
But the insurers' howls of anguish do reveal one problem which the industry
must address. One consulting actuary put it this way: 'If you always put
about the message that strength is important but life offices cannot be
compared, it's a natural consequence for someone to come along and say that
if the best information isn't published, then they'll just have to rely on
published information. It's the sort of service financial advisers need to
do their job properly, and the offices will have to put up with a degree of
arbitrariness.'
Life insurers have come under increasing pressure from both regulators and
the press to be more open about their charges and accounts this year. And
none denies that the industry as a whole has weakened. The dispute over the
S&amp;P ratings is the latest chapter in a story which seems to be moving
towards a more open and accountable industry.

surprised advisers acting for Mr Dieter Bock, who is buying Mr Rowland's
stake.
Mr Bock, the German financier, expects to move to London if he decides to
take up the seat on Lonrho's board, after completion of the rights issue on
January 15. According to one adviser the idea of transferring Lonrho's
operational headquarters to Germany is the first he has heard of it. "None
of this has been discussed with Mr Bock," said the adviser.
In an interview with The Observer, which is owned by Lonrho, Mr Rowland
said: "If I felt the company would be better understood and receive greater
support, we would be quite prepared to move our headquarters to Germany."
Mr Bock is underwriting half the 200m shares in the three- for-10 rights
issue at 85 per share, taking up Mr Rowland's rights, and buying half his 15
per cent stake at 115p a share with an option to buy the other half in three
years time.
Following the rights and sale of VAG, the Volkswagen/Audi import and
distribution operation in the UK, for Pounds 124m, Mr Rowland is predicting
that Lonrho's net debt will soon fall below Pounds 700m, against Pounds 947m
at September 30.
Further asset sales are planned, including some of the 4,300 flats which
Lonrho owns in western Germany.
It is understood that while Mr Bock has not discussed changing Lonrho's
domicile to Germany, he believes continental Europe will be an increasingly
important trading area.
This has encouraged further speculation that Mr Bock may be in favour of
re-opening the talks with Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining
group, over the future of Lonrho's 73 per cent controlling stake in Western
Platinum.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, head of Gencor, is keen to merge his platinum interests
with Lonrho's to create the world's biggest platinum group.

FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Arrangements advanced for sale
of 25m Teva shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARRANGEMENTS are well advanced for the sale of the 25m shares in Teva, the
Israeli pharmaceutical group, which are owned by the Common Investment Fund
 -the pot into which the Maxwell pension funds were pooled for investment.
Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, liquidator to Bishopsgate
Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds,
said that a sale was expected 'in the New Year'.
He would not specify a date, stressing that this was market-sensitive
information, but said the Teva shares 'were not necessarily ones we want to
hold on to'.
However, he had just approved the appointment of County NatWest, the
investment house, as advisers on the sale of the shares.
The Teva shares were valued at Pounds 25m last summer and are now estimated
to be worth more than Pounds 40m.
The shares were voluntarily returned to the pension funds in June this year
by National Westminster Bank, which had been pledged them as security for a
Dollars 27.3m (Pounds 17.9m) loan to Robert Maxwell Group, a Maxwell private
company, two days after Robert Maxwell's death.
Any distributions of the money to the pensioners is subject to continuing
disputes over claims on ownership between trustees to the five Maxwell
pension funds which contributed to the CIF.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Banks near to debt deal with Anglo United
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO UNITED, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, is close to
reaching an agreement with its banks over a debt-for-equity swap.
Under the terms of the restructuring plan, the banks would write off Pounds
110m of the group's Pounds 240m debt in favour of taking new ordinary and
convertible shares and zero coupon bonds.
Anglo, which mostly financed its Pounds 500m takeover of Coalite in 1989
through debt, has recently run into difficulties in repaying borrowings from
cash flow and disposals.
Last year's mild winter and continuing recession dented profits before tax,
which fell from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 8.3m for the year to end March. The
group's disposal programme of its non-core businesses has also been
adversely affected by the recession.
The restructuring plan involves the banks taking new ordinary shares set at
a premium to Anglo's existing share price which on Friday closed at 7 1/2 p.
Existing shareholders, who would retain more than half of the enlarged
equity, are to be offered warrants at the same price that the new ordinary
shares are to be offered to the banks.
A financier involved in the deal said: 'There has been some very tough
negotiations between the banks and the company. The most bruising aspect has
been management's insistence that existing shareholders should retain more
than 50 per cent of enlarged share capital.'

FT  14 DEC 92 / Klockner seeks cover from storm in the market: Why the
German steel maker has had to file for protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Klockner-Werke, Germany's little fish in the shark pool of the world steel
market, grew legs three years ago and made a dash for dry land.
But it was not fast enough. Loaded down with debts of DM2.7bn, (Pounds
1.08bn) enfeebled by tumbling steel prices, and latterly tripped up by the
sudden slump in the German motor industry, it stumbled into the protective
custody of the courts last Friday.
Desperate to catch its breath, Klockner applied for protection from its
creditors and permission to start negotiating to write off 60 per cent of
the debts accumulated by its two steel divisions and the parent, Klockner
AG.
Warrants for the proposed 40 per cent settlement are to be issued by the
Klockner Mercator Maschinenbau (KMM) subsidiary, in which the
still-profitable motor components, plastics and engineering businesses are
bundled together.
According to chief executive Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, this 'technical
financial operation' will set the group back on the road to survival. Since
Deutsche Bank, the group's biggest creditor and Germany's biggest bank, has
already promised its full support for the rescue, it may be safely assumed
that the composition proceedings will be successfully completed within the
scheduled maximum of six months.
Then, according to conventional wisdom, the worst of the current
international economic crisis should be over. The extent to which Klockner
will share in the upturn, and the form in which the stricken concern
survives, remain to be seen. But the group will be coming from a long way
back. It emerged limping from the last cyclical downturn in steel,
under-capitalised and over-focused on low value-added products such as
building steel. It has paid only one dividend in the past 18 years. Although
Mr von Rohr appeared unruffled last week, the group is technically insolvent
 -a whisker away from bankruptcy - and in the undignified position of being
only the first significant German group to run for cover in composition
proceedings in the past decade.
Klockner started to come to grips with its weaknesses in the late 1980s. In
1989, when steel and steel processing still accounted for 90 per cent of
sales and 100 per cent of profits, it began a process of accelerated
evolution. In a bid to add value to its core business, it took on Finnish
and Japanese partners to build a DM400m hot galvanising mill in Bremen.
Designed to supply Japanese car plants in Europe, it is due to start work
next year.
But a key shift was diversification into motor components, a path already
established by larger competitors such as Mannesmann, Hoesch and Krupp. In
1989 it bought Kautex, a plastics company making vehicle petrol tanks. A
year later it paid DM400m for Eurotec, a mouldings concern dependent on
motor makers for 85 per cent of sales. Plastics are now the group's single
biggest source of turnover. Meanwhile, other businesses - drinks machines
and bottling plant manufacture - were added for good measure.
But Klockner's new legs have proved neither long enough nor strong enough to
carry the group out of the trough. Plastics and mechanical engineering made
operating profits of just DM65m last year, as losses in steel climbed from
DM35m to DM200m.
Meanwhile, prospects are dimming for key parts of KMM dependent on the
automotive industry. German motor vehicle production is falling fast.
Leading manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, which earlier
this year unveiled plans for huge medium-term job cuts, have lately
announced extensive short-time working in the first quarter of the new year.
According to some estimates, German car output will fall by 500,000 in 1993.
The knock-on effects on suppliers were highlighted over the weekend when ZF,
the gearbox and transmissions specialist, said orders in the past few months
had been between 15 and 20 per cent down on last year. The company, which
reported an operating loss in 1991 and expects further deficits this year
and next, said it was to cut its workforce by 1,200. Car body press maker
Schuler unveiled plans to reduce its payroll by a quarter.
Crisis in the international steel market has been apparent for far longer. A
slight improvement in prices noted in Germany in the first quarter of this
year evaporated with the arrival of spring. According to Mr von Rohr, prices
are now DM150 a tonne lower than two years ago.
While pundits argue over whether conditions arise from structural or
cyclical sources, losses and tensions are mounting. Eurofer, the European
Community steel makers' association, has asked the commission for Ecu4bn
(Pounds 3.2bn) in assistance for a restructuring plan which will cost 50,000
jobs. According to some estimates there is a surplus annual capacity of 40m
tonnes in the EC. At the same time, the US authorities are preparing to
impose countervailing duties and anti-dumping charges on a range of EC
products.
In such conditions, shutting down Klockner's 3m-plus raw steel capacity
seems the logical and inevitable outcome. A takeover by either of the
leaders in German steel - which also have substantial motor component
interests - would almost certainly run into opposition from the Berlin
cartel authorities. In any case, Thyssen and the recently-merged
Krupp/Hoesch group which each have around 10m tonnes a year capacity, have
problems of their own. Western German steel production fell by 20 per cent
in November, due in part to Thyssen's temporary closure of a quarter of its
capacity.
One lingering sign of hope lies in the continuation of collaboration
negotiations between Klockner and Hoogovens of the Netherlands, which were
expected to be completed by the end of January. The process may take longer
now that the weaknesses of the would-be partner from Germany have been so
brutally exposed. If a bargain is struck it is more than likely to be on
Hoogovens' terms: as Mr von Rohr has discovered, there is more mercy in the
courts than the marketplace.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Kuwait's difficulties in Spain widen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE financial difficulties at Grupo Torras, the Spanish investment arm of
the Kuwait Investment Office which this month filed for receivership, have
spread to other parts of the Torras empire.
Prima Inmobilaria, the company's large property affiliate, has filed for
court protection against creditors. The move is widely seen as a serious
threat to another Torras subsidiary, Torraspapel, Spain's biggest paper
company.
The news of the Prima filing came as KIO officials met in London over the
weekend to contain a crisis of confidence in the KIO itself, which has been
left with losses of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) following its investment
thrust into Spain.
Some international banks are studying ways of acting against the KIO if
Torras and its affiliates do not repay their borrowings.
Bank creditors to Torras and its companies met last week in Madrid with KPMG
Peat Marwick, which has been appointed to replace Torras' Kuwaiti managers
during the receivership. Banks are insisting on accelerated repayment of
loans from Torras affiliates, which, like Torraspapel, are not legally
affected by the parent company's receivership. Formal approval for the
Torras receivership was given by a Madrid judge last Friday, a move which
immediately triggered the Prima filing.
Bankers in Madrid say Torras' financial plight may have been overstated.
While the Kuwaitis insist all Dollars 4.5bn invested in Spain since 1986 has
been lost, KPMG Peat valued the group at Pta2.9bn (Pounds 16.57m) just over
a year ago and warned Kuwait that if it tried to sell assets in a poor
economic climate it risked taking substantial losses.
KPMG also advised the Kuwaitis to treat Torras debt to the KIO as equity.
But in receivership papers filed in Madrid the Torras liabilities are shown
as Dollars 2.4bn, of which Dollars 1.6bn is debt to the KIO.
Prima, Spain's third largest property developer, filed for receivership on
Saturday along with its biggest subsidiary, Urbanor. The two have
liabilities of Dollars 1bn, owed mainly to Spanish banks.
The KIO, through Torras, owns just over 30 per cent of Prima, though former
Spanish managers say the true holding is close to 70 per cent.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Economics Notebook: Blackout on trade figures at time of
great import
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The blackout to be imposed on the UK's trade figures from January 28 is
bound to lead to intense speculation on what is happening to the economy.
A new set of figures will replace the old system in June, but by then a
more-than-usually interesting period for UK import and export flows will
have passed, much to the frustration of all those tracking the long-awaited
economic recovery.
Will the volume of UK exports to the EC be rising on the back of the
devalued pound, or will recession in Germany spell gloom for UK and other
European goods?
Will the higher cost of imports push the visible trade deficit wider? And
will a pick-up in consumer demand mean rising inflows of imports?
Behind the loss of this important information lies Intrastat, the new system
for collecting trade data to be adopted by each of the 12 member states of
the EC in January.
It was developed by the European Commission to tie in with the completion of
the single market at the end of this year.
Data on commerce with the rest of the world will still be available, but
since more than 50 per cent of the UK's external trade is generated in the
EC, these figures will provide only a patchy picture.
The abolition of border requirements and formalities means that customs
declarations, the current source of trade statistics, will no longer be
required.
To keep track of trade flows, Intrastat will require all businesses
registered for VAT to fill in two extra boxes on their VAT forms showing the
total value of exports to and imports from other member states.
Bigger companies will also have to complete a monthly report.
The introduction of any series of statistics is fraught with complications.
'We'll spend the first three months sending back forms to the hundreds of
people who fill them in incorrectly,' said the CSO. This is why the agency
has given itself a gap in which to get the series oiled before presenting
the numbers to the public.
Nonetheless, many are wondering why the new system was not introduced
earlier to run alongside the old series.
This would have avoided an interruption in the trade figures just when
economists will be looking for the full effects of sterling's recent
devaluation on the UK's trade position.
Only the very cynical would suggest that the UK government had calculated
the black-out, but the absence of sensitive trade figures for the first half
of next year could turn out to be very convenient.
'This is a genuine loss of information at a time when most people are
expecting the trade position to worsen,' says Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist
at Mitsubishi Bank in London. 'The trade figures are a vital piece of the
jigsaw that tells us what is going on in the economy.'
Without the data economists will probably fear the worst and speculate that
the so-called J-curve effect - whereby import prices rise faster than export
volumes - will force the deficit on the current account wider.
This, in turn, could lead to selling pressure on the pound.
The public will also have to wait to find out what one of the most important
parts of the 1992 initiative - the abolition of customs frontiers - is doing
for trade flows.
The CSO says it decided against an overlap between the old and the new
systems to avoid putting too heavy a burden on businesses.
It also points out that other member states of the EC are facing similar
problems and that their trade figures will also be subject to delay.
Some continental officials are blaming Eurostat, the EC statistics office.
The switch from one system of collecting the trade figures to another was
always going to be arduous, but there is a feeling among observers that
Eurostat took a rather cavalier attitude to Intrastat in the belief that a
rapid move to monetary union would soon render intra-EC trade figures
irrelevant. 'The EC gave the impression that they did not attach much
importance to Intrastat,' said one senior European economics official.
'It would have been sound practice to have the new system running side by
side with the old system in order to get feedback from one to the other.'
Eurostat insists that running the two systems together would have been
impractical.
Furthermore, original plans for administering Intrastat had to be scrapped
in 1989 when the Council of Ministers rejected plans for changing the way
VAT is collected.
But with only one month to go before the switch is made, there have been
complaints from UK businesses that they have not received the information,
paperwork and guidelines they need in order to comply with Intrastat's new,
and legally binding, requirements. Spain, Italy and Portugal have allegedly
not issued details of the procedures companies must follow.
Other EC countries have not requested six months to rehearse the system
before publication, but they too have their doubts about Eurostat's
timetable which suggests the first sets of figures should be ready for
publication by March.
'Statistical offices in countries like Germany and France will be under a
lot of pressure from their big users if they do not provide information in
the first three to four months,' said a Eurostat administrator.
The Germans, sensitive to their trade position since unification wiped out a
healthy surplus on their visible trade balance, say they will produce an
estimate in April. 'This is our plan, but not our promise,' said a spokesman
from the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden.
In Denmark, they believe the official timetable is unrealistic. The
statistical office said it did not expect to produce the results of
Intrastat until June at the earliest.
Given the likely sensitivity of intra-EC trade figures next year and the
confusion that Intrastat appears to be generating in certain quarters, it
could be that the UK approach of saying nothing will turn out to be the most
prudent.

FT  14 DEC 92 / US groups combine work on electric car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICA'S big three car makers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are to
co-operate much more closely in the development of electronic vehicles.
The trio have signed an agreement to investigate co-operation in the design,
development, testing and possible manufacturing of electric vehicle
components which would ultimately be used in each company's own vehicles.
The announcement comes as financially-troubled GM, the biggest of the three
US groups, scales back its much-vaunted solo effort in the field of electric
vehicles.
The venture will take place under the auspices of the US Council for
Automotive Research (Uscar), an umbrella body which co-ordinates research
among the big three, and it will aim to find 'the most effective way to
hasten electric vehicle development'.
Electric vehicles are currently uneconomic but California has insisted that
carmakers begin offering 'zero emission' vehicles - in other words, electric
cars - by 1998 if they are to sell other models in the state. Japanese
manufacturers are also intensively investigating electric vehicle
technology.
GM, which for years has trumpeted plans to have its plastic-bodied Impact
electric vehicle in commercial production by the mid-1990s, now appears to
have quietly dropped that plan because of the severe financial pressures
facing the group.
GM said it would produce up to 50 electric vehicles next year which would be
provided to utilities, local governments and others for technical feedback.
However, GM has also reportedly told hourly workers who had expected to
build the Impact of an indefinite delay in commercial production plans.
Detroit's big three have co-operated increasingly in recent years - in areas
ranging from vehicle research to political lobbying - as competition from
Japanese manufacturers has intensified. Uscar is already looking at advanced
battery technology for electric vehicles.
The alliance unveiled on Friday goes beyond previous joint ventures into
possible parts manufacturing. This might have caused anti-trust problems but
the companies evidently believe the competitive threat from Japan will
over-ride any monopolist concerns in the Clinton administration.

FT  14 DEC 92 / NHS move 'will hit drug groups': Industry tells government
that jobs are at risk from proposed blacklists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH-BASED drugs groups stand to lose up to Pounds 450m in sales from
National Health Service reforms proposed by the government, the drug
industry claims.
The lost sales could cost up to 5,000 jobs in the UK and as much as Pounds
400m in lost capital investment, according to the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry.
The proposals, announced last month by the Department of Health as part of
chancellor Norman Lamont's autumn statement, involve the creation of
blacklists of products that will no longer be provided by the NHS on
prescription.
The blacklists could cover up to 600 medicines in 10 therapeutic categories
and as many as 90m prescriptions a year.
The ABPI yesterday urged the government not to issue the blacklists. It
claimed that they were drawn up in spite of undertakings not to extend the
original list given in April by Conservative Central Office to US drugs
groups in the UK.
Exact details of the medicines affected by the measures are yet to be
disclosed. However, some groups could lose more than 70 per cent of their
NHS revenues.
The government's proposals are part of a Europe-wide drive by governments to
control spiralling drugs bills. In the UK, NHS drug spending has risen
annually by about 12 per cent over the past two years. The industry claims
the escalation is due to the ageing population and the government's own
programme of increased screening of patients. In 1991, the government spent
about Pounds 3.2bn on drugs.
Previous blacklists for seven therapeutic areas introduced in 1985 saved the
NHS Pounds 75m during the first year, according to the government.
The savings are contested by the ABPI. It argues that many patients were
prescribed more potent and expensive treatments instead of simpler and
cheaper medicines for which they would have had to pay.
The latest initiative is likely to affect significantly research and
development in the 10 therapeutic areas, warned Mr Mike Wallace, managing
director of Schering Healthcare, the UK drugs arm of the German group
Schering. He said that if new products were automatically blacklisted it
would provide a disincentive to invest in the field.
The 10 therapeutic areas include anti-diarrhoeals, hypnotics and
anxiolytics, appetite suppressants, contraceptives, topical anti-rheumatics,
as well as treatment for allergic disorders, vaginal and vulval conditions,
anaemia, ear and nose illnesses and skin diseases.
The most controversial area is that of contraception. The government could
save some Pounds 50m on prescriptions for the 3.5m women on the pill.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Concern over trade figures blackout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS fear incomplete trade figures over the next six months will
foster fresh uncertainty on financial markets at a critical time for the UK
economy.
Figures will not be available for UK trade with the rest of the EC,
accounting for more than 50 per cent of the total, for the first half of
next year.
The partial blackout comes at a sensitive time for the UK economy, as the
effects of sterling's devaluation begin to work through. It will also make
it difficult to gauge the effect on imports if the economy starts to
recover.
Analysts expressed concern over the effects this may have on sterling. 'The
more worried overseas investors become in the absence of these vital
statistics, the lower the pound will tend to settle,' said Mr Peter Spencer,
chief economist at Kleinwort Benson.
The decision not to issue comprehensive figures in the first half of next
year has been made because a new EC-wide system - Intrastat - is to be
adopted by each of the 12 member states next month. Based on VAT returns, it
will replace the current method of collecting trade data based on customs
declarations.
Other EC members also expect a delay in the publication of intra-EC trade
figures, but the UK is the only one to have decided on a formal six month
gap. Other countries, such as Germany, hope to produce a first quarter
estimate in April.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Isosceles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Isosceles' bankers now face an acute dilemma; either they pay up and let the
Gateway grocery chain live, or clam up and watch it die. With interest
payments still rolling up at an alarming rate and trading conditions
deteriorating by the day, the Isosceles buy-out vehicle desperately needs
more money. The company is inexorably heading for its third refinancing in
as many years.
It is, of course, natural for bankers to spread bad debts over a long time
to minimise one-off shocks, but inactive delay may be self-defeating. If the
company were broken up now its assets might at best fetch only half the
Pounds 1.2bn which the banks are still owed. On its present course they are
likely to be worth still less two years down the line. The banks may yet
decide that their best hope of recovering the shortfall lies in installing
pragmatic management with enough cash to re-ignite growth. Although trading
has been badly hit, Gateway still has a sound core which may make Pounds
110m operating profits this year. Some of the new formats Gateway has
launched also seem worth backing. A flotation may be a pipe-dream but future
sales of assets at better prices may yet provide an exit route.
The banks will clearly worry about throwing good money after bad -
especially as their original loans look increasingly like equity. With
Gateway's main rivals opening 250 new superstores in the next three years,
competitive attrition will hardly slacken. But the banks are already
hurting; boldness may be the only way to save them from more bruises.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Association of British Insurers should have known better than to get
into a public confrontation with the government over cover for acts of
terrorism. Its inflexible demand for extension of full government cover to
mainland Britain risks jeopardising the chances of a workable compromise.
The industry needs one, though, to secure the continuing goodwill of both
the government that regulates it and its large commercial customers.
This is not to deny the industry's point. Continental reinsurers are
unwilling to continue sharing terrorism risks, which would leave the UK
insurers unacceptably exposed. Without the benefits of reinsurance, April's
bomb in the City of London would have swallowed up most of the additional
capital raised recently by the likes of Royal Insurance and Commercial
Union. The proposed insurance pool looks sensible. A similar arrangement
covering atomic energy risks provides something of a precedent. The problem
is one of capacity. Without near universal participation by the insurers the
capital in the pool would hardly cover the risks. Yet the reinsurers will
doubtless be no more willing to join the pool than to assume the risk in a
conventional manner.
That suggests the government may have to step in, perhaps as a reinsurer of
last resort. Even if an agreement is forthcoming, though, both sides will
have to work fast to put adequate protection in place in time for next year.
It would not help the UK's international competitiveness if companies could
not fully insure their premises.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervousness surrounding the franc has left the French stock market
delicately poised. Having shed the strong gains of early this year, share
prices are oscillating in a narrow range and equity strategists are groping
for a convincing story. Without some resolution of the currency uncertainty,
it may be a while before the CAC 40 Index makes a decisive break.
The bull argument suggests that, although the French economy is quickly
cooling, it remains among the soundest in Europe and that the market is
fundamentally cheap. The current CAC rating is only 14 times next year's
forecast earnings - which may anyway be pushed higher by possible cuts in
interest rates. The unspoken hope is that the strains within the exchange
rate mechanism may yet force a devaluation. That would boost the market, as
in the UK, Sweden and, more latterly, Norway.
Such upward pressures, however, are offset by a stream of gloomy news from
the corporate sector and a slippage in earnings forecasts for individual
stocks. It does not help that the Parisian property market seems to have
become caught up in problems similar to London's. As long as the franc fort
remains inviolable, the Bundesbank's intransigence will delay interest rate
cuts hastening a downward market slide.
Even if the currency tension was resolved, however, the market would then be
looking forward to the government elections next March. Historically, the
CAC has often proved strong in the first half of the year, only to tail away
as the year progressed. Unless there is a devaluation, it could reverse the
pattern next year.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Testing the gears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's missive on capital instruments from the UK accounting standards
board is very much in the mould of Professor Tweedie's revolution. By making
clear distinctions between debt, equity and quasi-equity the proposed rules
will lead to a proliferation of categories on the face of the balance sheet.
The new shape of the profit and loss account has already muddied simple
measures of company performance such as earnings. The new rules will do much
the same job on gearing.
Financial engineers will doubtless feel deprived of the opportunity to dress
up debt as equity. The supply of convertible capital bonds, for example, has
notably dried up since the first tentative proposals for a tighter
definition of shareholders funds, but the investment bankers should not
protest too much. By creating a distinct home for non-equity shares on the
face of the balance sheet, the accountants may open other doors.
Companies may be encouraged to issue second tier equity instruments such as
preference shares. Banking regulators have long recognised prefs as a useful
shock-absorber if the issuer runs into trouble. Banks have duly made full
use of the opportunity. There is already evidence of interest among
insurance and oil companies. Since preference dividends are paid out ahead
of ordinary dividends, auditors are right to demand they are classified as a
separate tier. If that encourages the market to look at the economic
substance of instruments - rather than bald balance sheet ratios - so much
the better.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Decision on plans for Jubilee line postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON TRANSPORT has dropped plans to announce a go-ahead for the
long-awaited Jubilee line extension to London's Docklands today because
there is still no sign of an agreement with the private sector over the
funding of the Pounds 1.8bn scheme.
One London Transport source said negotiations over the private sector
contribution were 'completely and utterly bogged down in detail' and there
was no hope of an agreement this year.
London Transport had privately earmarked today as the launch date for the
line in the expectation that a deal with the private sector would be ready
for signature by now.
LT's London Underground subsidiary still believes a deal will be reached. 'I
don't believe that, having got this far, we are going to stumble over
detail,' it said. 'But clearly it is taking a good deal longer than we had
hoped.'
The postponement of the Jubilee line launch coincides with the publication
today of a hard-hitting report by the Confederation of British Industry
criticising the government for failing to evolve an integrated transport
strategy for London.
The report is expected to say that any business given the job of providing
the best possible transport services for the capital would have been sacked
if it had done as badly as the Treasury and the Department of Transport.
Work on the Jubilee line extension was to have started in April. It was put
on hold when the Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf project in Docklands, which had
undertaken to pay Pounds 400m towards the scheme, went into administrative
receivership.
Last month Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in his autumn
statement that the government was still prepared to fund the bulk of the
scheme, but only if the private sector paid up.
Canary Wharf's 11 bankers have agreed in principle to come up with the
Pounds 400m, but negotiations over the terms have proved unexpectedly
complex and now threaten to delay a start to the project until well into
next year.
Issues holding up an agreement are believed to be the bankers' insistence
that the deal should incorporate guarantees about the timing of the line's
completion and its levels of service.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Menu to make a leaner and fitter bank: Barclays faces some
awkward choices if it is to regain its position as Britain's most profitable
high street bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just for now, while its headquarters in the City of London are re-built, and
its directors struggle to restore its battered reputation, Barclays Bank has
taken up residence in the 1810 Johnson Smirke building at the old Royal
Mint. Visitors to the grandest high street bank in Britain are still served
lunch on fine china, and wine in cut glass. But the main course is humble
pie.
'We are not doing well, we are not giving our shareholders value, and we
have got to do better,' says Mr Andrew Buxton, the chief executive. 'We must
learn from the mistakes of the past, and improve substantially,' says Mr
Alastair Robinson, director of the banking division. 'I don't know if we
were dumber than others, but we were certainly dumb,' says Mr Joseph DeFeo,
director of service businesses.
This public hand-wringing is new for Barclays. While the other high street
banks went through troubles in the past five years, Barclays seemed to stand
above the fray. Until last year, it was Britain's most profitable bank -
making pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.39bn in 1988 - as well as the largest by
asset size. But in the past year, it has been beset by problems. It is
likely to make only a small profit this year - possibly even a loss -
because of bad debt provisions estimated by analysts at about Pounds 2bn.
This presents the bank with an awkward choice. If it cuts the final
dividend, it risks alienating shareholders who backed a Pounds 922m rights
issue in 1988. This was the capital used for an ill-judged expansion in
lending, including a rise in its Pounds 8.5bn portfolio of property loans.
Yet maintaining the dividend - at a cost of some Pounds 192m - would weaken
its capital base.
Barclays has tried to signal a fresh start by appointing Mr Buxton as
chairman and chief executive, following Sir John Quinton's retirement this
month. But the move has provoked controversy over whether Mr Buxton, the
managing director under Sir John, should combine the roles. After meeting
unhappy institutional investors, Mr Buxton said last week that the roles
would be split 'in the long term'.
Mr Buxton is pleading for time. He knows Barclays faces renewed criticism
when the full-year results are published in March. He believes a firm
improvement in profitability will only emerge in 1994, with next year being
a time of 'recovery'.
But he has set an ambitious long-term target: 15 per cent post-tax return on
equity within five years. This would require pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4bn
at current equity levels.
Senior Barclays managers want to do three things to reverse the bank's
fortunes. First, to draw a line under the past; second, to implement tougher
operating methods; third, to put in place a coherent strategy for the
future. Mr DeFeo believes if they achieve these, they deserve a reprieve.
But even he accepts that clemency cannot last forever. If results do not
improve in time, 'I would sack us all, and rightly so,' he says.
The degree to which Barclays achieves these aims will depend on an old
tension within the bank: how rapidly it should leave the past behind. The
past exerts a strong pull: Barclays was formed by a merger of local family
banks in 1894, and members of the families have traditionally formed its top
management. Although Sir John was not a member of the families, Mr Buxton's
family was involved with the Overend Gurney Bank, which was absorbed by
Barclays.
This is one reason why the bank's first aim of drawing a line under the past
has proved hard. Mr Buxton's association with family control has exacerbated
the dispute over his appointment as both chairman and chief executive. In
addition, the bank is still dealing with its past lending. One example is
Imry, the struggling property company, to which the bank lent Pounds 440m.
Barclays has already made one provision of Pounds 140m, and is expected to
disclose a further one of at least Pounds 100m shortly.
Its second aim is achieving more efficient operations. In branch banking
this means increasing the use of technology, so as to cut jobs. It now
intends to shed 18,000 of its 80,000 employees between 1991 and 1995. This
is welcomed by analysts. Mr Rod Barrett, of Goldman Sachs, says cutting
costs is the most direct way in which Barclays can improve profits over the
next two years.
Yet the bank must cut numbers while trying to improve service. Mr Robinson
says relations with customers are strained. Many small businesses have
complained about the bank's tighter lending policy. 'It is important to
re-establish relationships of trust with our customers,' he says. Mr DeFeo
says it will take up to six years to install the technology needed to
improve analysis of loan risks and provide 24-hour telephone banking.
In investment banking, greater efficiency means being selective about the
type of business it seeks. Mr David Band, chief executive of the BZW
investment banking division, says BZW has wasted energy by trying to compete
with banks such as Deutschebank within their own countries. He says BZW
needs to seek cross-border business where it can offer a competitive
advantage. 'There is no point in throwing money at everything. We have had a
blunderbuss approach, and we must aim more carefully with a rifle,' he says.
The third aim, of establishing a coherent future strategy, is probably
hardest of all. Mr Buxton has drawn up a five-year plan, with the aim of
making Barclays 'a European bank with global reach'. What this means is not
clear. He wants to develop its 50 branches in France - acquired through
buying L'Europeene de Banque last year - and 220 branches in Spain. Yet in
Germany, it will eschew branch banking.
The emphasis on international expansion raises the question of balance
between branch and investment banking. Mr DeFeo says Barclays must reduce
its reliance on UK branch banking because the difficulty of reliable risk
management means its earnings will otherwise be 'jerked around in huge
cycles' with the economy. In the US, Barclays has decided to concentrate on
investment banking after making losses on its branch network.
In healthier times, the balance might be achieved through competition
between the two divisions for capital depending on which made a greater
return. Yet as Mr Band says, this is hardly possible at the moment because
'on recent results, you would not allocate capital to anyone'. At least for
a few years, the balance will have to be decided more by directors'
judgement than by figures.
For the moment, the main figure that concerns directors is Mr Buxton's
target of 15 per cent post-tax return on equity. Analysts and directors
agree there is virtually no chance of achieving that next year, while this
year's profit will be puny at best. It is likely to be some time yet before
there can be a change on the lunch menu at the Johnson Smirke building.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised to read that, in spite of low profit, Pilkington
decided to maintain its interim dividend, funded largely from reserves
('Pilkington raids reserves for dividend', December 11).
It strikes me that the short-term interests of the shareholders are being
met to their long-term disadvantage. As national officer of the GMB union
representing many Pilkington employees, I cannot believe that Pilkington
reserves could not have been better spent on research and development to
maintain its technological lead, on new training initiatives to increase the
skills of the workforce, on capital investment to replace some of the jobs
the company has lost or plans to lose, or on a mixture of all three.
From a leading company that had a reputation for planning ahead and looking
after the interests of its employees this seems to me to be the worst kind
of short-termism.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Letter: Simpler method of assessing council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES R ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Bradman (Letters, December 5) underestimates the problems
householders face with the (in)equity of the council tax, and exaggerates
the steps needed to improve it.
The fact that the date for national valuation is April 1 1991 for everyone
does not mean that everyone faces the same prospect of being in the wrong
band. Since that date the proportion of properties in the Granada TV region
falling into the A band has declined from 41.6 to 35.1 per cent; in the
Thames TV region, the proportion has increased from 10.7 to 13.4 per cent.
Even within the same area different types of property have behaved
differently in price terms.
The simplest way of assessing property tax, as we pointed out to the
Treasury at the time, is to proportion payments to the number of rooms in
the dwelling. This can readily be self-assessed (and would have saved
millions of pounds of tax-payers' money had it been) and checked, and will
not change unless the owner wishes it to. It has justice in that the
over-crowded pay less than those with greater amenity, while most people
will pay more or less in proportion to their demands on the services
provided.

Sir, The report by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, into
the 'dash for gas' misses one important possibility. It is common practice
for a new supplier aiming to establish a new market to lower prices as a
loss leader. The gas industry is offering lower prices now but is unlikely
to be able to sustain them. If this has the effect of knocking most of the
coal-based competition so much the better for the new supplier. However, the
long-term effect will be to increase both electricity and gas prices.
There is no sign Prof Littlechild has taken this into account. His evidence
should therefore be treated with considerable caution.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Letter: Analysis of monetary union in danger of missing real
benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MAXIMILIAN CARTELLIERI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is disappointing to witness how the debate on European monetary
union risks being reduced to an exchange of non-objective views by the
nostalgic representatives of one or another conviction.
It simply does not do justice to the facts for Prof Martin Feldstein to
reduce the gains to the UK from monetary union to those arising from the
fact that a single currency would 'simplify UK business dealings within the
EC,' (Personal View; 'The ultimate opt-out', December 9). Or to assert that
those 'are small in comparison with the higher average cyclical unemployment
in Britain that would result from the loss of a national monetary policy and
of a currency that responds to market forces to maintain competitiveness'.
First, even supporters of Emu recognise that savings from transactions costs
under Emu would amount to, at most, 1.5 per cent of GDP. But this is beside
the point, because these are a by-product rather than an objective of Emu.
The most important benefit for UK business is the removal of long-term
exchange rate uncertainty, which under the current system of floating rates
increases the risks of doing business in EC countries and for which forward
facilities barely exist at all.
The main benefit for the UK economy as a whole is the prospect of escaping
from the inflationary boom-and-bust cycles that have characterised economic
policy in the past. The larger credibility of an independent European
central bank makes it likely that this goal can be reached at lower cost
than is possible under present arrangements.
Prof Feldstein claims that UK unemployment would increase as a result of the
loss of national monetary policy. Why should it? It is well known that the
UK is characterised by real-wage rigidity, and that the temporary gains in
competitiveness from devaluation are quickly eroded through higher
inflation. Britain cannot price itself back into world markets simply by
devaluing.
Prof Feldstein's other claim, namely that under Emu monetary policy might be
determined by politicians and not by central bankers, has even less factual
basis. The ECB will be more independent than the Bank of England is at
present - if he fears politically motivated interventions into monetary
policy, the ECB is the best way to reduce this danger.
Weighing up publicly the pros and cons of a big decision such as Emu is
crucial - but it is time that the debate is again based on facts and
analyses.

The men in charge of repairing the reputations of two much-maligned public

the Labour party's former chief press officer now in the Prince of Wales'

Had Observer noticed that Donald Keough, president of Coca-Cola, was among
the corporate chieftains backing the Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum?
Indeed, it says something for the POW's growing international pulling power
if his forum can recruit top executives like Keough and Volkswagen chairman
Carl Hahn to pontificate on corporate social responsibility in the latest
edition of First magazine. In the past the Prince's choice of business
leaders seems to have been driven more by people who want to know him,
rather than people he should get to know.
Observer's second call of the day was from an aide to Amstrad's Alan Sugar
pointing out that his boss had just opened the Pounds 800,000 Sugar wing of

Well done Alan, but in terms of corporate good deeds, it falls well short of

chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, survives in tact after today's
grilling by the Commons Public Accounts Committee.
The 44-year-old Jones, one of the young thrusters of Welsh business, has
done a good job raising the profile of the WDA and attracting lots of well
known foreign companies to invest in the valleys. But the National Audit
Office, the independent official watchdog, has taken his agency to task for
the size of its golden handshakes - roughly a quarter of the staff have been
made redundant over the last three years  - and its policy of free petrol
for WDA bosses. The irregularities were not big enough to cause the WDA's
accounts to be qualified, but they have pricked the interest of the PAC.
For a man occasionally mentioned as a future boss of the Confederation of
British Industry or even chairman of the BBC, Jones needs to prove to the
PAC that he is just as much at home with the fine print as he is with the
big picture.

The Chicago Board of Trade couldn't have asked for better weather for the
launch of its new catastrophe insurance futures contracts. As trading began
on Friday, gale force winds, rain, and flooding brought New York city to a
halt and battered the East coast.
Unfortunately, the first day's trading volume was virtually non-existent
because the New Jersey-based property claims reporting service, that the
CBOT relies upon to keep traders informed of estimated damages, was put out
of action by mother nature.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Observer: Piris tops the summit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If there was ever a lawyer-of-the-year award then Jean-Claude Piris, head of
the legal service at the European Council, deserves it. He is the unsung
hero of the Edinburgh summit for the way he helped devise a solution to
Denmark's demands for legally binding exemptions to the Maastricht treaty.
A graduate of the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the 49-year-old
Piris is a rare breed of international civil servant. A lawyer by training,
he also possesses a keen political instinct as shown by his conviction that,
in the end, the Danish question was always a 'matter of presentation.'
His political nose, well-honed by stints in the UN and the OECD as well as
the Brussels bureaucracy, proved indispensable as he joined lawyers from the
British Foreign Office in finding a solution to the Danish problem: how to
meet Copenhagen's demands for legally-binding opt-outs from Maastricht
without re-opening the treaty or triggering re-ratification in member
states.
Before and during the summit, Piris faced what amounted to a Spanish
inquisition, first from foreign ministers, and then from heads of government
on whether his wording undermined the letter and spirit of the Maastricht
treaty. In the end, the agreement reached on Saturday drew praise all round.
EC president Jacques Delors, described it as 'extremely subtle", and Danish
officials said it was 'devilishly clever'.
Piris, who speaks fluent English, had a broad idea of how to resolve the
Danish question as early as last September. But it was only in the final
weeks before the Edinburgh summit that the UK presidency called upon Piris.
Like the battle of Waterloo, it was a close run thing.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Letter: Realism needed for UK leisure training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JANET SALMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The leisure industry employs 2.4m people and the tourism industry alone
earned Pounds 7.1bn in foreign exchange in 1991. Its ability to provide a
top-class service and a quality product is important to the economic health
of the country.
The survey on progress towards the UK training targets for national
vocational qualifications (NQV) in the leisure industry, showed that the
training target of 50 per cent of the workforce to be working towards NVQ
level 3 by 1996 is optimistic, based on the present progress.
The Confederation of British Industry and the government should consider
setting more realistic and achievable targets. The structure for the
provision of NVQs is complex and overlapping and consideration should be
given to reducing the number of awarding bodies and industry lead bodies.
Total quality management and national vocational qualifications are
'synergistic' approaches which need to fall under one, rather than two
government departments.
National vocational qualifications must be implemented in a streamlined and
cost effective manner, if Britain's leisure industry is to compete with
Europe. Janet Salmon,

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Maastricht journey resumes: The Edinburgh summit's
successful conclusion has put the Community back on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Edinburgh summit will go down as the moment when the European Community
pulled itself together and put its house in order.
After months of drift and indecision, EC leaders struck a series of deals
which offer a reasonable prospect of saving the Maastricht treaty, thus
ending the political crisis which has gripped the Community since Denmark
rejected the treaty in a referendum last June.
Even more important, the weekend agreement between the Twelve on the EC
budget and on enlargement talks with Austria, Finland, Sweden and, later,
Norway, provides a second, perhaps more secure framework for the Community's
development to 2000.
'We have solved the Rubik's cube that was laid before us,' declared Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, shortly before midnight on Saturday in the packed
media centre at Meadowbank sports centre. Other EC officials agreed that the
much-derided UK presidency had indeed pulled off a high-stakes gamble. 'By
making everything interdependent,' said a Brussels official, 'the British
turned Edinburgh into an all-or-nothing summit.'
In the post-summit afterglow, it was easy to overlook that success had come
at a price. The legally-binding exemptions from Maastricht obtained by
Denmark go to the heart of the EC's ambitions as agreed in the treaty,
notably the goal of a single European currency by 2000 and a common EC
defence policy.
Nor did the summiteers tackle in a serious fashion the broader crisis in the
EC. A continental recession is spreading into Germany. The European exchange
rate mechanism (ERM) continues to be plagued by instability. Beyond its
borders, the EC faces the threat of the Yugoslav crisis turning into a wider
Balkan war. A sobering reminder of this came on the eve of the summit when
1m Greeks took to the streets in Athens to protest against possible EC
recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
The Macedonia issue underlines the limits of the EC's powers, especially in
dealing with a recalcitrant member, in this case Greece. Faced with the
Greek government's opposition to possible Community recognition of
Macedonia, EC leaders pledged a 'substantial' package of aid to the former
Yugoslav republic and held out the promise of World Bank and International
Monetary Fund assistance; but they ducked the fundamental issue.
Yet with some justification, Mr Major can argue that, without a settlement
of the EC's internal problems, there is little prospect of turning the
Community's attention outward. The breadth of agreements reached at
Edinburgh give the EC a genuine chance of a 'relaunch' next year when, in a
comic twist of fate, the UK hands over the presidency of the EC to Denmark.
The Danes represented the most pressing issue at Edinburgh: namely, how to
resolve Danish demands for opt-outs on Maastricht, without re-opening the
treaty or requiring re-ratification of a new treaty by member states.
Without an agreement on the Danish issue, the summit was doomed to failure.
Given the legal acrobatics involved in finding a solution, EC leaders strove
to convince observers that they had made the Danes sweat. Yet the outcome
left Denmark with all of its substantive demands intact. These included
exemptions from the third phase of monetary union when the Twelve are
supposed to move to fixed exchange rates by 1999 at the latest; a common EC
defence policy; common EC citizenship; and co-operation on justice and
immigration matters at a Community rather than inter-governmental level.
The Danish deal was made even more palatable by some useful practical steps
on making EC decision-making more open and the bureaucracy less intrusive.
In future, votes in the Council of Ministers will be published and some
policy debates will be open to the public. The European Commission has also
agreed to exercise more restraint in proposing legislation. But a promised
hit-list of EC directives for scrapping fell far short of British hopes.
Foreign diplomats in Edinburgh said the Danish deal looked like the EC was
turning into a Community a la carte, where members can pick and choose what
they like. Yet there is a precedent: a year ago the UK rejected Maastricht's
social policy chapter and reserved its right to take part in a common
currency.
Other observers took a more charitable view by comparing the Danish outcome
with the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales. 'It's like Charles
and Diana,' said a German EC-watcher, 'Denmark has chosen the path of
separation but not divorce.'
Whatever its legal niceties, the Danish package comes down to raw political
expediency: how to ensure that the Danish people approve a second referendum
on Maastricht, at the end of April or early May. Or as one UK official put
it: 'The goal of the summit is to save Maastricht, irrespective of its
contents.'
Both Mr Poul Schlueter, the Danish prime minister, and Mr Major pointed out
that without ratification of Maastricht by all Twelve there can be no
treaty; indeed, Mr Major refused to be drawn on his own ratification
timetable beyond a promise to complete 'hard on the heels' of the Danish
vote.
The Anglo-Danish shilly-shallying on Maastricht plainly infuriated most EC
leaders. Over lunch on Friday, Belgium took the lead in warning Denmark and
Britain that they could not stop the Ten pressing ahead 'with the substance
of Maastricht'. Virtually all the other leaders joined in; but no one
ventured to predict what will happen if the Danes say No once again next
spring.
There is considerably more certainty about the EC budget. The summit's
seven-year budget deal is a big achievement because it removes the one issue
always guaranteed to fray tempers and produce political stalemate: money.
The Edinburgh package allows the Community to plan for the future with a
degree of security, just as it did in February 1988 when, once again, German
generosity broke the logjam. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission
president who before Edinburgh railed against the risk of creating an EC run
on the cheap, appeared satisfied. 'I have got 85 per cent of what I wanted,'
he said.
The budget deal is a compromise between north and south - or between the
rich and poor members of the EC. But by contrast with 1988, Chancellor Kohl
on this occasion has become a reluctant paymaster. Burdened with the costs
of unification, Mr Kohl insisted that the Twelve commit themselves to begin
enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland and Sweden early next year.
The accession of the richer northern states by 1996 fits the German goal of
spreading the budget load.
For Spain, which led the fight for more development funds, the deal offers
firm numbers on so-called structural and cohesion funds funnelled to the
poorer members of the Community, including Greece, Ireland and Portugal. In
real terms, Spain can claim that it has won a doubling of these funds by
2000. In effect, the increase in funds is the 'bribe' for southern members
to pursue the budgetary discipline necessary to meet the strict criteria to
qualify for European monetary union (Emu)
Yet the question is whether the goal of Emu is still feasible. The summit's
limited agenda was again underlined by the leaders' unwillingness to discuss
the turbulence in the exchange rate mechanism, which has plagued the system
since Denmark's No vote in June cast doubt on monetary union.
Instead, EC finance ministers agreed to a modest serious of measures aimed
at stimulating growth in the Community, mainly through co-ordinated measures
aimed at boosting capital spending in west and east Europe.
The European Investment Bank is to set up a temporary lending facility of
Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.04bn) to finance roads and telecommunications projects with
more flexible lending criteria. The summit also agreed to set up a new
European Investment Fund with Ecu2bn of EIB capital to provide guarantees to
small and medium-sized businesses. But UK claims that the combination would
stimulate private finance for Ecu24bn worth of projects look far-fetched.
Cynics might dismiss the growth package as a confidence trick. But
confidence is just what the Community needs after the buffeting of recent
months. This is why the enlargement talks with the Austrians and
Scandinavians are viewed as so important by Mr Delors, Chancellor Kohl, Mr
Major and President Francois Mitterrand.
Besides persuading Denmark that it cannot afford to be left out of the EC,
the enlargement talks are also aimed at recapturing the dynamism of the
late-1980s when the EC embarked on its goal of a single intergrated market
by the end of 1992 and a common European currency by 2000.
Yet the lesson of the summit is that, while almost every member state
believes enlargement is a good thing, they each have a slightly different
impression of what it will mean for the EC as a whole.
Late on Friday night, Chancellor Kohl spoke expansively of a Community
stretching eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak
Federation, and the Baltic states - but not Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey or the
Balkans. For Mr Kohl, enlargement should help the EC absorb the German giant
at the centre of Europe while also giving the Community the resources to
become an equal partner with the US and Japan.
Britain, too, shares the desire for a wider EC. But the UK is far more wary
of loose German talk of 'political union' and is deeply sceptical about the
EC's chances of pulling off Emu. France - pulled along by Germany - now
appears reconciled to the fact that the Community must first widen its
membership before tackling the problem of 'deepening' EC institutions.
The institutional problems raised by an enlarged Community will not go away.
More members surely means more majority voting in the Council of Ministers;
it may mean, too, a greater role for the European Parliament; it could even
require a new EC constitution.
The uneasy compromise reached at Maastricht - a mix of intergovernmental
co-operation and tentative federalism - will have to be revisited, most
likely at a conference to review the treaty in 1996.
For the moment, Mr Major is savouring the satisfaction of a job well done.
Criticism of the UK presidency was, in hindsight, overdone. Thanks to a
combination of clever legal drafting, meticulous preparation on the budget,
and a little help from Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, Mr Major
can rightly claim that the EC is back on track.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Leading Article: EC pulls back from brink
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC drew back from the brink at Edinburgh because its leaders saw all too
clearly the risk of falling over the precipice. Sensible compromises, above
all over the Community budget and the Danish question, have re-assembled the
Twelve around their core aim of political and economic integration. But the
interpretation of how, and during what period, this objective is to be
achieved is now, in most parts of the EC, less ambitious, and therefore more
achievable, than that outlined a year ago at Maastricht.
Mr John Major can take pride in winding up Britain's problem-strewn EC
presidency with agreements restoring a sense of EC balance and purpose.
Anything else would have wrought devastating harm to the Community's image
and its ability to deliver policies, both internally and externally. Not
least, failure in Edinburgh would have damaged chances of forging a strong
relationship with the new US administration, and of helping alleviate chaos
in Russia and other parts of eastern Europe.
Yet the return of consensus in no way guarantees that the EC can avoid
turbulence. Enlargement talks with Austria, Finland and Sweden are to get
under way from next month. But the EC needs as much as ever to prove that it
is a club worth joining. The resolve displayed in Scotland must be
translated into action. This applies not only to the task of making the
concept of 'subsidiarity' both efficient, and meaningful to ordinary people.
The EC must also ensure a positive outcome to the Gatt talks, a subject left
off the Edinburgh agenda.
Currency disorder
On the economic front, the path towards economic and monetary union (Emu)
now looks less clear than a year ago. But this increases the urgency for the
EC to focus efforts on attacking the causes of the instability which forced
Britain's and Italy's departure from the exchange rate mechanism. Both in
tackling currency disorder and in curing the Community's most pressing
difficulty - lack of economic growth - there can be few grounds for optimism
unless Germany rectifies disequilibrium caused by mismanagement of its
economic reunification. As long as this primary EC fault line remains,
economic initiatives such as the infrastructure programme agreed in
Edinburgh will be little more than palliatives.
With the formal entry into operation of the 'single market' next month, the
EC has put into place measures which represent potentially the best
long-term way of allowing the Community to flourish. But without greater
confidence in shorter-term economic prospects - which would be improved by
lower German interest rates - the 1993 programme will yield less than
optimal results. Without a resumption of growth, the EC's budgetary
problems, patched up in spite of histrionics from Mr Felipe Gonzalez, may
resurface. The Emu convergence targets will be still more difficult to
achieve. Most important of all, the EC's failure to make a real contribution
to eastern European revival will start to become not merely embarrassing
but, conceivably, a disaster.
No schism
If the Edinburgh meeting has re-established realism about the pace and scope
of the Maastricht journey towards closer integration, it has also resolved
some doubts about who will be taking part. France and Germany have expended
much rhetoric about the need to prevent the Community from being
over-influenced by countries most sceptical about the Maastricht process. It
is clear that the move to Emu can only take place at two, or several speeds.
Yet Edinburgh demonstrated that there will be no fundamental schism. Denmark
achieved its sought-after exemptions from pivotal parts of Maastricht, while
Britain withstood pressure to agree a July 1993 ultimatum for securing the
treaty's ratification.
Since it can reasonably be assumed that both Denmark and the UK will indeed
ratify the treaty next year, the overall agenda for Community policies will
continue to be set by the Twelve, augmented by members of the European Free
Trade Association (Efta) from the mid-1990s onwards. The treaty is far from
perfect. But in setting out a framework for more effective co-operation, it
represents the EC's best opportunity for enacting policies increasing
stability and prosperity across the whole of Europe.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Boy who cried 'shoots'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all know the story of the boy who cried 'wolf' so many times as a hoax
that when there really was a wolf no one believed him. But what do we call
his cousin, who announced imaginary good news so frequently that he, too,
was disbelieved when right? The best I can suggest is 'the boy who cried
'green shoots''.
The long-awaited Treasury monthly report, published last Thursday, is not
written by either kind of boy. But it contains a far more comprehensive set
of indicators than anything published on as timely a basis by academic
institutes, private analysts or the press. The value of the report is as an
example of both the economies of scale and of a public good. Government
economists and statisticians can provide a more comprehensive service than
almost anyone else and it is absurd that publication has been so long
delayed.
The most important uncertainty on the monetary and inflation front is
whether the depreciation of sterling will pass through into domestic prices
in the next year or two - thus devaluing the pound in your pocket - or
whether the depressed state of demand and activity will stop the
pass-through. Sterling's departure from the ERM is far too recent for even a
tentative answer to appear in the latest indicators.
The December Treasury report is thus more interesting on the real economy.
The impression given is of an economy that has bottomed out in terms of real
demand and output. There are a few indicators such as cash balances (M0),
corporate borrowing and retail sales suggesting something a bit better. But
wise people will not shout 'green shoots' until they have seen them
springing out of the ground.
One analyst complained that the monthly report did not even restate the
government's own goals and objectives. But that is to assume that 'the
government' knows them itself. For instance, is the objective of
macroeconomic policy confined to keeping inflation within the 1 to 4 per
cent band explained by the chancellor to the Treasury committee immediately
after departure from the ERM? And is the talk of 'going for growth' just
mood music? Or are there output objectives as well? We have not a clue.
My main technical criticism of the report is that there is almost nothing
that enables one to evaluate the gap between output and capacity, either in
terms of physical capacity or the margin of unemployed labour. This cannot
be right. An x per cent growth of output must mean something different in
the aftermath of a deep slump to what it means when production is pressing
against the limits of capacity. I have tried to remedy the deficiency by
adapting a Goldman Sachs chart. This suggests at first sight that the gap
between output and capacity is now so large that a hefty kick-start is
indicated.
In the Goldman Sachs version, however, the greater part of the output
shortfall appears to be due not to depressed home demand but the trade
deficit. In other words, recession conditions are due mainly to the
diversion of British demand into imports and the export slowdown.
My own suspicion is that part of the overseas gap is temporary, representing
depressed international conditions, especially in Europe. Part represents
remaining deficiencies in the trade statistics. Another part may be remedied
by sterling's depreciation, if that is not completely eroded by domestic
inflation. Yet a further part may be offset by sustainable inward investment
and thus allowed to run.
In addition, the level of usable capacity may be less than suggested by the
trend line. In that case the recession gap that can be safely closed either
by policy measures or by spontaneous recovery is that much smaller. Such
barely articulated ideas may help to rationalise the official penchant for a
modest initial recovery. But without some concept of capacity output and its
trend, even the best of economic reports is just a string of numbers to be
tagged at the back of executive summaries.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Keeping London on the move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TO STEP into a central London restaurant around noon these days is to be
greeted with a forlorn sight: that of bored executives sitting
unaccustomedly alone, picking at their bread rolls and sipping fizzy water.
It is not that they cannot afford a decent meal. They have simply forgotten
the extent to which recession has eased the traffic jams, and arrived
embarrassingly early for lunch.
It will not last. Recession may have tempered the demand for transport in
London, but in due course an upturn will rekindle the lingering sense of
crisis about the inadequacy of the capital's transport. If London is to
maintain its international competitive position, the government needs to
think urgently about how it is going to cope with the strains on its
infrastructure.
Unfortunately, it shows little inclination to do so. True, it has fulfilled
its manifesto commitment to appoint a minister with special responsibility
for London transport, but it turns out to have been a hollow gesture. The
minister's role seems mainly to consist of being visible and
well-intentioned: he lacks the budget, staff and powers to have any real
clout, and strategy remains a dirty word.
Thus, the government's policies for London are a hotch-potch. Car ownership
in the capital is forecast to grow by nearly 50 per cent in less than 20
years, yet badly-needed investment in the public transport alternatives -
suburban rail services, buses and the Underground - is being cut. Urban
clearways, known as red routes, are planned to speed vehicles into central
London, but there is no parking policy to deal with them once they get
there. In theory, red routes should speed up buses, too, but the buses are
to be privatised and deregulated, in all probability leading to the sort of
free-for-all that has already brought disruption to some other British
cities.
Jubilee Line
At least, the government can say, it has authorised construction of one
public transport project: the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line extension. But this
decision, too, smacks of incoherence at a time when the government is
cutting a third off the Pounds 750m-a-year investment budget for the rest of
the Underground. While it is possible to make a case for the Jubilee Line
scheme for the regenerative effect it will have on London's Docklands, it is
less easy to do so if it means leaving the rest of the Underground to
deteriorate into an ever-worsening state of decrepitude. It is the transport
equivalent of adding a luxurious extension to a house that needs a new roof.
Given the constraints on public spending, it is clear that any transport
policy for London needs not only to be coherent, but to identify new ways of
funding investment. One option is higher fares, but that would risk putting
more traffic on the roads and raising labour costs. Besides, passengers
alone should not be expected to meet the cost of the community-wide benefits
conferred by good public transport, such as congestion relief, environmental
gains and increased property values.
Road pricing
The logical alternative is to attempt to capture those community-wide
benefits by other means. Until recently, two-thirds of London Transport's
investment was paid for out of a levy on London rates, but the linkage was
severed in 1990 to soften the introduction of the community charge. It now
seems sensible to restore the connection, at least in the case of
businesses. The Confederation of British Industry is today expected to urge
more investment in the capital's transport. The government might test the
CBI's resolve by asking its London members to make good London Transport's
Pounds 250m investment shortfall with a 10 per cent transport levy on the
uniform business rate.
Ultimately, road pricing may offer a solution to London's transport problems
by simultaneously suppressing traffic growth and yielding funds for
transport investment. But London cannot afford to wait that long: it needs
better transport now. The government has rejected the idea of London-wide
political structures, preferring to exercise direct rule over the capital's
affairs from Whitehall. It must now start generating confidence that it has
an understanding of the capital's transport problems and face up to the
responsibility for putting them right.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: Life breathed into stone - Colin Amery admires the
work of Eric Gill / Sculpture and architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you feel the need before Christmas to escape from crowded festivities, I
thoroughly recommend some calm moments at the Barbican Art Gallery.
I went to see the exhibition of sculpture there by Eric Gill (which runs
until February 7) with some reservations, a lot of prejudiced, and muddled
preconceptions about Gill's life and work. But this exhibition does what a
good exhibition should: it both delights the eye and stimulates the mind. It
also presents with great clarity the personality of the artist within the
context of his creative life.
Much of Gill's figurative sculpture is hard to see because it is either in
private collections or is permanently fixed to buildings. This is the first
retrospective of his figurative sculpture - and it is no mean achievement to
have assembled nearly 50 important works, mainly of the period 1910 to 1930.
They are beautifully displayed in a way that brings out the direct quality
of Gill's work. He made stone breathe quietly and many of these works exude
a tranquil life of their own.
I also braved the architectural terrors of the Barbican, because I believe
that there is no real future for architecture as an art that can inspire and
nourish unless its practicioners have a sympathy for all the visual and
plastic arts.
I am permanently baffled by the separation between architecture and the fine
arts. There is still very little communication between architects and
artists in educational establishments, and there have only been marginal
improvements in the last decade in the commissioning of public art.
The official artistic bureaucracy wastes millions on schemes like 'per cent
for art', which sees art as some kind of expendable 'add-on', not as an
intrinsic part of any creative initiative. understood that it is possible
for fine art - which embraces the irrational, imaginative and sensual - to
be a crucial part of everyday life. His sculptures for the BBC, London
Transport and his war memorials have a sense of propriety and rightness
where they are. He understood architecture and its relationship with
sculpture - perhaps because his creative life began as an apprentice to an
architect.
When he was 18, Gill joined the office of WD Caroe, the leading church
architect of the time and from whom Gill learned the disciplines of
architectural drawing. In the transitional years of the 1900s style was as
much a matter of debate as it is today. Caroe, who was often thought of as a
rather dull gothicist designed in a whole range of styles.
Gill soon became fascinated by the theories of William Morris and John
Ruskin and absorbed from them some of his early ideas about craftsmanship,
labour and art. He decided not to attend evening classes in architecture,
but to study the art of lettering under Edward Johnston at the Central
School - and to learn practical masonry. These two skills flourished and in
1903 another architect, Edward Prior, gave Gill his first lettering
commission. He invited him to design the lettering for the new medical
school in Downing Street, Cambridge. So it was architecture and lettering
that enabled Gill to become a freelance artist craftsman, and to put some of
his theories into practice concerning the sacredness of work dedicated to
the service of art.
By 1909 Gill was beginning to make figurative sculpture and felt that he had
made a most important discovery. He wrote: 'it was like a new alphabet - the
word was made flesh.' Gill's method of working was to carve directly in
stone. He would not consider modelling in clay or employing the help of
other craftsmen - he cut directly into the stone and was probably one of the
first sculptors in England to work in this way since the Middle Ages. It is
this sense of directness that is so evident at the Barbican exhibition.
The remarkable nature of Gill's talent as a sculptor was soon recognised and
he secured an important commission as early as 1913, when he was asked to
carve the Stations of the Cross for the new Roman Catholic cathedral at
Westminster. The pencil, ink and water colour drawings in the exhibition are
no substitute for going to Westminster Cathedral to see the full size carved
originals, but they are fascinating as working drawings squared up for
transfer to the stone. As drawings, they have that heraldic, almost
diagrammatic, quality that is also present in the stone reliefs. For such
relatively early work they are extraordinary and potent icons.
The mixture of eroticism and religious faith is a thread that runs
throughout Gill's work and life. We all learned more than we really needed
to know about his communal attitudes to sex in Fiona MacCarthy's biography
of Gill. What is surprising - and wonderful - about this collection of
sculptures is that they exist with lives of their own - quite apart from all
the hypocrisy of Gill's life - as very pure works of art of great integrity.
Even 'Ecstasy', Gill's most sexually obvious work (which was owned by the
same collector who commissioned Rodin's 'The Kiss') has more of a moment of
wonderment about it than any sense of pornography.
The two major architectural works, 'Prospero and Aeriel' for the BBC's
Broadcasting House in London, and the 'Four Winds' for London Transport's
headquarters, are well known. It was more interesting to see the drawing for
the huge relief for the headquarters of the League of Nations in Geneva
(1935) on the theme of the 're-creation of man', and the actual Portland
Stone relief from the Midland Hotel (1933) in Morecambe on an Odyssian theme
 -which is wild and spirited and curiously scaled. We need more artists like
Gill, prepared to work with architects and to be sympathetic to the idea
that every man - especially the craftsman and builder - is also an artist.
Sadly, we are today miles from that idea, as most building is merely
mechanical assembly of manufactured parts. Gill shows the intense, creative
fulfilment of working with the hand and the eye. This exhibition quietly and
carefully illuminates that idea.

How do we dare treat young doctors as we do, expecting them to take life and
death decisions while working 80 hours a week? Most of us must surely come
into contact with hospitals from time to time, and thus know what is going
on, in a way that is not merely theoretical. Yet nothing changes. The last
episode in BBC2's remarkable documentary series Doctors To Be (7.50) shows
how disillusion and bitterness have replaced excitement and idealism in the
eight years since the 10 young doctors began their training. Also coming to
an end tonight is 'Allo 'Allo, that extraordinary repository of English
prejudices. Italians are amorous cowards, Germans are ludicrous prigs, the
French can speak English only with the most absurd accent, and the English
as represented by the officer class are brainless. Repeats will run for the
rest of our lives (8.00 BBC1). Witchcraft (9.00 BBC2) described as a period
thriller, is yet another modern fiction straddling the centuries. Witches,
witchfinders, and adultery are the chief ingredients, and the stars, in a
Cotswold setting, are Peter McEnery, Lisa Harrow and Alan Howard.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: The Witches - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On one side of St Martin's Lane you can see the opera Hansel and Gretel (at
the Coliseum). On the other you can see The Witches (at the Duke of York's).
It is amazing how much the two works have in common, especially in this
particular pair of stagings. A witch is not just a crone living in the
faraway depths of a wood any longer. Some children this Christmas will be
taken to the one, some to the other. An enterprising parent might do well to
take their children to both.
The witches in Roald Dahl's story do not bake children or eat them - they
turn them into mice. And the best fun of seeing The Witches as a play comes
in watching these transformations - how are they done? - and then in
watching the boy-mice adapting to their new circumstances. In fact, the mice
scenes resemble another show opening this weekend, Frederick Ashton's Tales
of Beatrix Potter; the opening of the play's second half reminds me of what
Ashton said to his mice-dancers 'Wouldn't it be lovely to have a tail, think
of all the things you could do with it, you could pick things up and carry
them, you could skip rope with it . . .'
Otherwise, Dahl's story holds an audience simply because he tells a story so
well. It does not have the mythic power of the Grimms' fairytale, but its
modern liveliness and its whimsical philosophical touches have their own
impact and wisdom. Boy learns from Grandmother that the world is full of
witches; and to us, watching, the witches (as in Humperdinck's opera) are
both alarming and absurd. Boy and Grandmother save the children of England
from the witches; but Boy himself has to stay a mouse, and learns how to
cope with that.
The adaptation and staging are by David Wood, and they proceed at a more
plodding, heavy-handed pace than last year's staging of The BFG Karen
Briffett plays Boy with over-wide eyes and a shrill voice about half an
octave too high, but is otherwise engaging. The performance I watched was
largely attended by school-parties of young children. They were not driven
to any particular peaks of fright or amusement, but they were completely
attentive to every turn in the action. The grown-ups fidgeted only a few
times.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: David Mamet's 'Oleanna' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even more interesting than the clash of opposites onstage in David Mamet's
new play Oleanna, now playing at New York's Orpheum Theatre in a production
directed by the author, are the conflicts it elicits offstage, within and
between its audience members.
The play is a beautifully written, elegantly constructed (save for an
implausible denouement), and wholly provocative conversation piece which
furthers America's national debate about sexual harassment, begun last year
when then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas was accused of harassment by
his former employee Anita Hill.
In the brief first act, college student Carol comes to her professor's
office to confess that she is floundering in his education course. John, the
professor, takes her on as an educational experiment, offering her an 'A' if
she will agree to one-on-one tutoring sessions. In the process of their
conversation, John makes some off-colour remarks and, when Carol becomes
particularly distraught, puts his hand on her shoulder. He confides in her
that he is up for tenure and hoping to buy a house; the repeated phone calls
from his wife and lawyer about the purchase make for a conversation full of
half-sentences and interrupted thoughts - quintessential Mamet.
Having set up the situation - and the audience - Mamet plays his trump card
in the second act. Carol brings charges of sexual harassment against John.
Unless he can persuade her to drop the case, his tenure hearing will be
postponed and he will lose the house. They meet in his office twice more,
the stakes rising and the gulf between their positions widening in a
terrific exercise in dramatic tension, which Mamet undermines with an
overwrought explosion of violence at the play's end.
Did John really harass Carol, or has Carol set John up to undermine his
career? Mamet left the characters' words and actions so ambiguous that it is
up to each audience member to decide; differing perceptions turn casual
discussions of Oleanna into confrontations.
On one level Mamet is the perfect playwright for this subject matter;
indeterminate language is his forte. But, given the position of women in his
previous works - nonexistent, as in Glengarry Glen Ross and American
Buffalo, or peripheral, as in The Water Engine and Speed-the-Plow - it is no
surprise that in Oleanna he has stacked the deck against them by
underwriting Carol's character. Unlike John, we are never given information
as to her background, personality or motivations.
This problem is exacerbated by Rebecca Pidgeon's wooden performance - for
which Mamet must share blame. Presumably we are seeing what he, as director
as well as writer, wants us to see: in the first act she is a lifeless,
clueless, sexless creature in a shapeless sack dress who repeats 'I don't
understand' with whining monotony. William H. Macy literally acts circles
around her: he twitches, rants and preens all over the stage while Pidgeon
sits motionless and stares stupidly at her feet. In the second act, she
becomes a mannish fembot in trousers and waistcoat spouting allegiance to
her 'group,' seemingly driven less by passion than programming.
But Mamet's uneven treatment of the issues only strengthens his overriding
point that what really matters is not who is right or wrong, but who has got
the power. The closest thing this battle of a play has to a winner is not
John, Carol, or the genders they represent, but the auteur himself. He is
out to provoke with Oleanna, and he has done it, in spades.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: Scandinavian song - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The time when the only Scandinavian song we ever heard was Grieg's 'With a
waterlily' sung in German by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf suddenly seems a long way
off. Over the past month the 'Tender is the North' festival has inaugurated
a virtual single market for songs, in which the music of Northern composers
has won an equal hearing alongside that of their continental counterparts.
On Thursday it was the turn of Soile Isokoski, a young Finnish soprano too
little known in this country. I first heard Miss Isokoski as a Valkyrie in
Amsterdam, but for her Wigmore Hall recital she had laid her spear and
helmet aside. It is the rounded and pure beauty of the sound that is her
prime gift, fine for the Mozart heroines she sings on stage, but also warm
and succulent in Berg's Seven Early Songs.
Like the other sopranos in this festival, she gave us the inevitable Grieg
waterlily, floating in her performance over an undercurrent of urgent
anxiety. But that degree of intensity in her singing was unusual. Among her
Schubert songs, one of the best was 'Nacht und Traume', where the voice
showed that it could grow in volume and pressure, while sounding just as
relaxed as before.
Overall there was a lack of variety, which the beauty of the singing did its
best to mask. The Four Dream Songs by Aulis Sallinen, Finland's most feted
living composer, had a special nocturnal loveliness. The accompaniments,
evocatively played by Marita Viitasalo, are made up of eerie sounds
overlapping each other in soft focus to set up the dream-like atmosphere,
while the voice sings above.
Throughout the festival another voice has been introducing the Scandinavian
songs. This is Elisabeth Soderstrom, recently-retired Swedish soprano, who
has preceded each of the recitals with a talk on what the evening's singer
is about to deliver. On Tuesday last, however, Thomas Allen cancelled at the
last moment and she discovered that she was introducing herself.
At a moment like this a long and varied career into which to delve is
invaluable. Soderstrom, expertly accompanied by Roger Vignoles, gave us
probably the most far-reaching programme of all: Sjogren, Nielsen,
Peterson-Berger, Kilpinen, Linde, and Rangstrom. The last - Rangstrom has
been one of the discoveries of this festival - composed two of the singer's
favourite songs, including the bleak but tender 'Den enda stunden'. For
once, Grieg's waterlily was left in peace.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: Billy Budd - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opera North tackles this season its first Billy Budd. This difficult,
dark-spirited, musically magnificent opera almost always brings out the best
in the companies that take it on. Rarely, however, has it received a
performance of such raw, angry power as Friday's at the Leeds Grand Theatre.
The production, which comes from Scottish Opera, was first shown in Glasgow
in 1987. Then, it was electrifying; now Graham Vick and his associate Paul
Maloney, matched every inch of the way by the conductor Elgar Howarth and
the Opera North orchestra and chorus, have rendered it still tauter, and
exposed the themes of the Britten-Forster-Crozier collaboration to a still
harsher theatrical light.
Budd emerges here, as it did in Tim Albery's very different 1988 ENO
staging, enriched and strengthened: its combination of grand opera,
historical epic, domestic tragedy and male-voice symphony reverberates with
startling new insights, new illuminations.
Vick treats it as a study in vicious social repression of naval serfs by
their overlords. The single set (a superb feat of design by Chris Dyer) is
also a single dominating image - a ship seen in transverse section, layered
in deck levels, pivoted on a central mast, and contained like a globe or
crucible. The 'whole world' of Captian Vere's floating monarchy (or slave
ship, which is what it is) is ceaselessly evoked in the action - and, with
it, the hideous violence that runs through the drama like an open sore.
Few opera performances have so fully caught a sense of community, while at
the same time exposing it to such keen-eyed 'political' scrutiny: how
horribly vivid yet truthful the depiction of sneaks, spies, bullies,
betrayers, even Dansker's backing-away from Billy at the moment of
discovering he is Claggart's marked man.
The erotic subtexts of the opera are not disguised; neither are they forced
into undue prominence. Vick's licence in presenting a dressing-gowned alter
ego of the old captain, constantly haunting the action like an agonised
conscience, encourages a constant - but again, never crudely underlined -
consideration of the interaction between motive, impulse and consequence. If
this encourages one to view the captain's epilogue with a touch of irony,
that seems only fair. It is, after all, Vere's equivocal character that
affords the opera its focal point.
The cast is of superlative quality from top to bottom. On opening night
Jason Howard's Billy was suffering a severe throat infection; he dealt with
it expertly, and brought to the part a free physicality, a credible
earthiness and volatility of temperament which I have not encountered
before. Nigel Robson's Vere lacks tenor volume but not subtlety of
utterance: he is a singing-actor of three-dimensional eloquence. John
Tomlinson, principal revenant from the 1987 Scottish Opera cast, is the
Claggart of our day, certainly the most strongly voiced and roundly drawn of
my experience.
This is one of Opera North's most impressive achievements - not smoothly
palatable Festive Fare, perhaps, but wonderfully relentless in its grip.
Grand Theatre, Leeds: in repertory until January 18, then on tour to
Nottingham, Birminghan and Manchester.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Management: How to take a team into the premier division -
Christopher Lorenz assesses a new study on improving corporate performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You may be on your way up the executive ladder, or have reached the top. You
may be languishing in middle or junior management. You may be a technical
specialist - or another type of 'professional' - with no managerial role at
all. You may be on the shop floor or the service front line.
Regardless of your job and status, you are almost certainly part of, or
surrounded by, the most common organisational form in modern management  - a
team. Or several.
'So what?' you may ask. Everyone, except a player of individual sports,
knows that teamwork is the best way of motivating people and improving their
performance.
The objective may just be to cut costs and boost efficiency, or, more
commonly these days, also to respond more quickly to customer needs and
competitive challenges. It is no coincidence that most 'model organisations'
 -whether they are christened 'horizontal', 'networked', 'non-hierarchical'
or 'clustered' - are based fundamentally on teams.
The trouble is that most so-called teams are not worthy of the name, and
fail utterly to deliver the high performance levels of which real teams are
capable. They are often either just working groups or task forces, which
though usually seen as synonymous with teams, are actually very different
animals.
At best, they are a third type of species: potential teams, which try hard
to improve their performance, but lack clarity about purpose, goals, or
joint work-products, as well as the discipline to hammer out a common
working approach. Nor have they established mutual accountability.
At worst, they are pseudo teams: collections of people concerned about
togetherness, not performance, and so distracted by their dealings with each
other that their communal performance is less than the sum of their
individual parts.
The chart (left) shows the yawning gap between their output and that of
high-performance teams, in which members are deeply committed not just to
team performance (as in real teams), but also to each other's personal
growth and success. These are just a handful of the conclusions from an
unusually thorough study of teams - real and pseudo - which has just been
published as a book, appropriately titled The Wisdom of Teams.
As well as challenging much conventional wisdom about teams, the book is
full of advice about how to organise proper - and properly effective - ones.
It draws examples from manufacturing companies such as US General Electric,
Hewlett-Packard, Kodak, Motorola, and Procter &amp; Gamble, as well as from
service organisations such as the Burlington Northern railroad, the Deloitte
&amp; Touche accounting firm, Prudential Insurance of America and even a high
school basketball team called The Killer Bees.
The book also provides a plethora of case studies of team inadequacy - from
slight to complete - although most of the company names have had to be
disguised.
In order to write the book, its co-authors Jon Katzenbach and Douglas Smith,
who are leading consultants at McKinsey &amp; Co in the US, studied the workings
of more than 50 teams (actual and so-called) in 30 companies. Their findings
include:
Top teams are the most difficult to make effective.
A demanding performance challenge, set within the sort of performance
culture exemplified by Motorola, tends to create real teams far more
effectively than do team-building exercises, special incentives, or team
leaders with ideal profiles.
The disciplined application of 'team basics', including size, purpose,
goals, skills, approach and accountability is often overlooked.
Hierarchy and teams go together much better than is appreciated by people
who see teams as a replacement for hierarchy.
Team performance opportunities exist in all parts of the organisation,
rather than just a few, as most companies think.
Most organisations prefer individual, over group or team, accountability.
Teams naturally integrate short-term performance with longer-run learning.
Katzenbach and Smith define real teams as more than just 'an extremely
dedicated group of people working together to accomplish something of great
importance to themselves'. That is the definition of a group, they argue.
By contrast, a team should be thought of more precisely as 'a small number
of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose,
performance goals and approach for which they hold themselves mutually
accountable'.
Each part of this definition - or what Katzenbach and Smith call 'this
essential mode of discipline' - requires close attention, they say. For
instance, 'complementary skills' covers three categories: technical or
functional expertise; problem-solving and decision-making skills; and
interpersonal skills.
The duo stresses repeatedly that a focus on performance and accountability -
not on chemistry, teamwork or good communications - 'is what makes teams
happen'.

EDMUND NUTTALL has won a highway infrastructure contract from English
Industrial Estates Corporation (English Estates) as part of its overall
Chatham Maritime development on the Medway in Kent.
The Pounds 6m project, officially entitled the Primary Highway Network
Contract, is a key element in the Medway towns northern relief road scheme
linking the commercial centres of Chatham, Gillingham and Rochester and
providing direct access to Chatham Maritime from the motorway network.
When completed, the scheme will provide a dual carriageway north-south link,
some 650 metres in length. Two roundabouts will serve existing developments
and open up further sites for development at Chatham Maritime. Central to
the scheme is a grade separated roundabout to link the Medway tunnel being
constructed to the west, with the Gillingham northern link road that will be
developed to the east.
Twin 22-metre span reinforced concrete bridges will carry the Primary
Highway across the tunnel approach cutting. This 125-metre-long trough is to
be excavated to a depth of 10 metres within piled walls.
Also included is a 0.2km dual carriageway western link road. Ancillary works
also include provision of a pumping station.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kevin O'Donoghue (left), previously managing director of Phileas Fogg
snacks, has had his appetite whetted by Geest's 'very big plans for
added-value convenience foods' and has taken over as managing director of
the newly-formed subsidiary Geest Convenience Foods.
The fresh produce and prepared foods group has identified a number of
chilled markets where it has been investing heavily; it has recently spent
Pounds 10m on what is supposed to be the most sophisticated pasta-making
production facility in northern Europe.
Following two acquisitions in the past three years, Geest is the UK's
leading supplier of chilled pasta and number two in chilled pizza. The
incoming managing director's ambition is to expand convenience foods, via
organic growth, acquisition and partnership, tenfold over the next five
years.
O'Donoghue, 42, joined Phileas Fogg in 1988, brought in by the founders of
Consett-based Derwent Valley Foods who had, in 1982, started what became a
high-profile start-up in north-east England. Very successful in developing
snacks such as tortilla chips and Californian corn chips, the three founders
wanted to devote more time to business interests outside the UK, and
employed O'Donoghue as managing director of Phileas Fogg. He claims to have
doubled turnover there, trebled profits and 'grown the brand to a must-stock
item for most of the multiples'.
Previously, O'Donoghue had been president of United Biscuits in Brazil,
setting up a joint venture biscuit company with a Brazilian flour-milling
organisation. He describes himself as having previously 'done the rounds' at
United Biscuits, which he joined in 1973 from Powell Duffryn.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Management: Tiers are shed as councils cut back - Britain's
local government is preparing for a leaner future. Chris Tighe looks at one
authority's experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE

<TEXT>
In his Wallsend town hall office, North Tyneside council leader Brian Flood
is pouring tea from a big, canteen-style metal teapot into a mug emblazoned
ANC Women's Section.
It is the sort of scene which has confirmed Labour-controlled North
Tyneside's place in Conservative ministers' demonology of combative,
left-wing local authorities.
But between sips of tea, Flood is explaining how the council's restructuring
is wiping out layers of bureaucracy, making the organisation
consumer-orientated, empowering its staff to meet service delivery targets
and eliminating around 1,100 jobs.
Local authorities throughout Britain are undergoing profound change brought
about by financial constraints, shifting social trends and central
government-imposed policies like compulsory competitive tendering. But few
restructurings are carried out amid such financial crisis.
North Tyneside is not only scrapping its departmental structure and toning
down its previously confrontational approach to Tory central government, it
is simultaneously deciding how to make cuts next year of Pounds 20m - 15 per
cent of its budget - shedding in the process at least one in eight jobs. And
it is doing all this in a matter of weeks.
The restructuring is partly a response to financial duress; council leaders
believe no more cuts are possible under the present structure without
eroding basic services.
The council also believes the delivery of flexible quality services demanded
by the public conflicts with the conventional local government structure of
departments, each jealously guarding their roles and budgets. 'The present
culture, which has to change, is one based on secretive professionalism
which has erected barriers around each individual part of the council's
activity', says Flood.
Within North Tyneside's 'fossilised' departmental structure there are as
many as 16 layers between directors and employees. Flood does not suggest
that the intervening layers have been idle. 'Everybody's been working hard;
they're all answering each others' bloody questions.'
The present system has also stifled communication. 'It might start off as
broad as the Tyne but it comes through like a tap dripping.'
Nor has there been any forum where heads of department meet councillors.
Until now, says Flood, local government has been designed to keep elected
members out of the way. 'That's why it's failed.'
The restructured North Tyneside council will have six executive directors
who will meet each week with the leader and senior councillors, forming, in
effect, a management board. One side-effect of the new structure is that
ruling group councillors will gain more power to ensure that committee
decisions are implemented.
Present legislation stipulates that councils must appoint directors covering
areas like education and social services. North Tyneside's executive
directors will bear the titles required by law, but none will be responsible
for the day-to-day running of services. That job will fall to 16 heads of
function, under whom will be 45 senior managers, 150 managers, a lower tier
of first-line managers - and then grassroots employees.
'We want a flat structure,' says Flood. There will be no more than three
layers between heads of function and the people on the ground.
Heads of function will be set tough targets for service delivery; these may
include annual budget reductions for core services so they can introduce
pilot schemes to explore new areas of consumer demand. Performance related
pay is under consideration.
The reorganisation, to be concluded by Christmas, means that all 9,500
employees have had to apply for posts at or around their current level. So
far the top three levels have been appointed. The spotlight is now on the
lower managerial tiers where job cuts will be heaviest.
Compulsory redundancies, anathema to the council until now, are inevitable
although 1,000 staff have left voluntarily in the last two years.
The unions are sympathetic to the council's budget problems and do not
oppose the restructuring in principle. But Nalgo, the white collar public
service workers' union which expects 500 of its 3,000 members at the council
to lose their jobs, is unhappy at the distribution and size of the cuts. It
is holding a one-day strike tomorrow and threatens further action.
Branch secretary Trevor Johnston argues that: 'There's this great myth that
there are all these layers of managers doing nothing. It might have been
true 10 years ago. But there's been substantial delayering over the last
five years.'
Such is the scale of staff cuts, he argues, that some managers in the new
structure may face an impossible task.
He complains that the reforms have encouraged an 'opportunity culture', with
some employees gaining promotion at others' expense.
Nalgo is worried that restructuring is distracting attention from heavy job
losses. Conversely, Ian Gordon, Conservative opposition group leader, fears
that the service cuts which may result from the council putting its finances
in order may cloud the public's perception of restructuring.
Although Gordon criticises some appointments as 'blatantly political', both
the restructuring and the Labour group's new pragmatism have Tory support.
'We welcome this conversion on the Damascus road,' he says.
Still, tough battles lie ahead. But Flood, topping up that tea mug, is
bullish: 'We think in three years' time we'll set the standard for the way
councils operate.'

FT  14 DEC 92 / People: Robb steps back from Aberdeen Trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Robb, one of the founders of the small and aggressive fund management
company Aberdeen Trust, is stepping down as executive chairman, but
remaining on the board as a non-executive director.
The group, which has suffered, particularly earlier in the year, from the
weak dollar, has seen its share price drop from 60p in March 1991 when it
joined the stock exchange, to a low of 24p this year.
Currently with around Pounds 1.6bn of funds under management, the company's
transaction-driven expansionist strategy has not been without its
detractors. 'George Robb has felt for some time that what interests him most
is building companies,' says chief executive Martin Gilbert, 'whereas now we
have entered a consolidation phase. We need to pay attention to becoming
more client-orientated.'
Whereas the company has been strong in Far Eastern emerging markets and UK
smaller companies, it has lagged in other areas, notably continental Europe.
Another catalyst for the change in emphasis has been the purchase of Century
life assurance group in September, which added around Pounds 450m in new
funds to manage as well as affording access to a direct sales force. 'It is
going to be an enormous amount of work integrating Century,' Gilbert
believes.
Robb, 50, and Gilbert, 37, founded the business in 1983 as a management
buyout from a firm of Aberdeen solicitors, Brander &amp; Cruickshank, where Robb
was a partner in the investment management department and Gilbert was his
assistant. Robb took over as executive chairman at the time of the stock
market listing. 'Since becoming chairman, I found there was a decreasing
amount to occupy me. It was a miscalculation on my part,' Robb, who was
previously chief executive, now admits. 'It was a good time to make a
break.'
He is looking for other opportunities, not necessarily within fund
management. Among a number of other outside directorships he is on the board
of Aberdeen Petroleum, a USM company which he helped establish in 1981.
Meanwhile, Angus Pelham Burn, 61, takes over as non-executive chairman. A
well-known figure in the Scottish financial community, Pelham Burn has been
a director of Aberdeen Trust since 1985. He is also a non-executive director
of the Bank of Scotland and a member of Grampian regional council.
*****
Alastair Ross Goobey, James Capel's chief investment strategist and author
of one of the livelier weekly investment newsletters, has decided to
practise what he preaches. Next month he takes over as chief executive of
PosTel Investment Management, Britain's second biggest pension fund manager.
Goobey, 47, is only the third chief executive to look after the Pounds 20bn
of pension fund money of British Telecom and the Post Office. He takes over
from former Bank of England man Alan Threadgold, who in turn took over from
Ralph Quartano.
Although Ross Goobey has made his name recently as James Capel's investment
guru and a special political adviser to the chancellor of the exchequer, he
has earned his spurs as fund manager. Before becoming a stockbroker, he had
been a director of Geoffrey Morley &amp; Partners, independent pension fund
managers, and before that had managed the Courtaulds pension fund. Although
part of his job at PosTel, which has 160 staff, will be administrative, Ross
Goobey will also be director of securities investment.

RESULTS DUE
ASDA, the grocery chain, announces its interim results on Friday and is
forecast to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to between Pounds 30m
and Pounds 40m, with most estimates around the Pounds 35m mark.
Analysts expect the improvement to be due to the reduction in debt and
increase in interest receivable thanks to Asda's Pounds 350m rights issue
last year, rather than an improvement in trading. The operating profit is
expected to be little changed. The considerable efforts of the new
management team led by Mr Archie Norman will take a while longer to pay off.
H P Bulmer Holdings, the premium cider and drinks group, is set on Wednesday
for a 20 per cent jump in pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31.
Analysts put interim profits at about Pounds 10.7m compared with Pounds
9.07m last year, with the dividend likely to be increased 10 per cent to
3.8p (3.45p).
Devenish, the west country pub retailer, is expected to report a 16 per cent
rise in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.3m on Thursday. Pubs suffered
from poor tourist trade in the first half but the second half has been
helped by acquisitions.
Tiphook, the trailer and container rental group, is expected to report today
a decline in interim pre-tax profits to around Pounds 35m from Pounds 39.2m.
Slower economies across Europe have taken their toll. However, the group is
likely to lift its dividend by about 10 per cent from 4.4p a share a year
earlier.
Southern Electric is reporting its delayed interim figures tomorrow. It had
postponed them until after its chairman had testified to the House of
Commons on coal. Its pre-tax profits are likely to rise by about 30 per cent
to around Pounds 18m.
Daily Mail and General Trust should unveil on Wednesday a modest increase in
full year profits to around Pounds 50m from Pounds 47.7m. Advertising
markets have been weak, particularly for the Evening Standard's classified
jobs.
Electronic Data Processing, the computer services supplier, is expected to
report today full year profits of about Pounds 4.8m, up only modestly from
Pounds 4.1m a year earlier.
Ferranti International, the electronics group brought to its knees by its
disastrous acquisition of ISC in the US, reports interim results tomorrow.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Economics: Hints on UK recovery prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST rush of UK figures for this year will provide further hints on
whether the economy is emerging from recession.
Another rise in the retail sales figures - out on Wednesday - would add to
evidence that a recovery in consumer spending is underway. Expectations are
for a 0.2 per cent increase on the month.
The bad news will come with the unemployment figures on Thursday. Economists
are forecasting another big month on month rise.
Most economists do not expect unemployment to stop rising until at least the
end of next year. The very pessimistic do not see it peaking until 1996.
Thursday's unemployment figures will include the latest quarterly labour
force survey which measures unemployment through a household survey rather
than by adding up the total number of people claiming benefit - the method
used to provide the monthly figures. Many argue that the labour force survey
gives a more accurate picture of the jobless total.
Other economic events this week follow. The figures in brackets are the
median of economists forecasts from MMS International, a financial
information company:
Today: Spain, November consumer price index; France, November CPI (up 0.2
per cent on month, up 2.3 per cent on year); Japan, November trade balance
(Dollars 7.7bn surplus), November wholesale price index (flat on month, down
1.3 per cent on year); US, Q3 manufacturing final report, President elect
Bill Clinton holds economic summit lasting two days in Arkansas; Belgium, EC
finance ministerial meeting in Brussels.
Tomorrow: UK, November CBI distributive trades survey released, November
producer prices indices - output (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 3.2 per cent
on year), excluding food, drink and tobacco (up 2.4 per cent on year), input
(up 1.2 per cent on month, up 3.1 per cent on year), October industrial

FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (8): Indonesia leads the drive for
expansion - Regional report: the Far East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAR East is becoming accustomed to being the exception to the rule.
While Japan's economy has suffered from the global recession, many countries
in Asia continue to grow at 5 to 10 per cent a year. This has led to a
burgeoning demand for pulp and paper in the region, and the industry is set
upon expansion.
A clutch of figures tells the story: Malaysia's paper industry is expected
to average 27 per cent growth between 1991-1995; Thailand's paper demand in
1990 grew 19 per cent; Indonesia's paper capacity is expected to grow by
over 30 per cent this year to 3.2m tonnes.
The far eastern picture, however, is not just one of growth, but of gradual
change, the driving force of which will be Indonesia, the world's largest
archipelago with over 13,000 islands and a 185m population.
Indonesia's forests, estimated at 144m hectares, are second only in size to
Brazil; and, with a per capita income of Dollars 600 a year, the country is
labour-competitive. Labour costs, which account for about 22 per cent of
Indonesia's total pulp production costs, are one third of Thailand's and
Malaysia's, and one tenth of Taiwan's.
However, a shortage of international capital, and a decision last year by
the government to set ceilings on offshore borrowing, has made financing
large pulp projects difficult. Officials of the Indonesian Pulp and Paper
Association, estimate that at least seven pulp projects, with a planned
total output of 1.7m tonnes, have recently been cancelled or postponed.
As Miss Sian Hansen, pulp and paper analyst at Crosby Securities, explains:
'Virgin tropical fibre-pulp has taken a tumble in price, and the plants just
couldn't be economical in this kind of world market.'
Five projects, however, with a capacity of 3.4m tonnes a year of pulp are in
the pipeline.
Sinar Mas Group, Indonesia's second largest conglomerate, is installing new
pulp plants at its Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia subsidiaries, with capacity of
about 2,600 tonnes a day, at a cost of about Dollars 1bn.
Industry officials say Barito Pacific plans a plant of 1,500-2,000 tonnes of
pulp a day in South Sumatra, to be operational by 1995, at a cost of up to
Dollars 1bn; Mr Mohamad Hasan, a wealthy logging concessionaire, is planning
a plant of similar size in East Kalimantan; and Indorayon has designs for a
1m tonne a year pulp plant in Riau province.
Mr Gus Nilo, managing director of Sinar Mas, believes Indonesia's long-term
prospects are bright, and explains that 'the issue is volume. If you cut
down all the forests in Vietnam, it would be unable to supply China.'
He estimates that only 5 per cent of Indonesia's forests need be turned into
plantations for one third of the world's pulp demand to be supplied.
Whilst Indonesia's potential in the Far East is unrivalled, it has been slow
to exploit its advantage. Miss Hansen estimates that Indonesia is at least
10 years behind Brazil in technology and the development of plantation
forests, of which only 326,000 hectares had been planted by the end 1991.
Indonesia's underlying competitive advantage makes its emergence as a key
player in the market almost inevitable. 'Korea, Taiwan and Japan have pulp
mills, but they import the wood. Their wood costs are about four times
ours,' explains Mr Nilo.
While Brazil remains the cheapest producer, Indonesia should be able to cut
costs further as more plantations come on stream, boosting productivity and
pulp quality. Miss Hansen forecasts that the typical catchment area for a
200,000-tonnes-a-year pulp mill in Indonesia will fall from a current 32,000
ha toward the 20,000 ha of Brazil.
Indonesian companies are already looking toward greater regional
integration. Sinar Mas has taken a stake in a paper mill in Ling Po, in
southern China. There are plans to invest up to Dollars 200m to expand the
plant, the pulp being supplied from Sinar Mas's Indonesian operations.
As the industry matures in the Far East, officials believe Indonesia will
capitalise on its cheap pulp production to take a greater share of the
region's growing paper market.
As with pulp, that change is likely to be gradual. In 1990, Japan's paper
and board demand totalled 28.2m tonnes, about half the region's consumption.
Indonesia is almost alone in the region in producing more paper than it
consumes, but net exports in 1991 were only 270,000 tonnes.
Although this was a fourfold increase over 1990, further high growth will be
constrained by domestic demand, a low 7.5kg in 1990, which is rising by over
10 per cent a year.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (9): Cheaper land, faster trees -
Regional report: Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR has been a milestone for Latin America's pulp and paper industry.
With Aracruz, the world's largest eucalyptus pulp company, completing a huge
expansion project in Brazil, and the start-up of three new mills in Chile,
the region is poised to become the world's leading low-cost supplier of
cellulose.
The growth of Latin America's pulp industry confirms a world trend to move
to low wood-cost areas. Land is cheap in both Brazil and Chile, generous
government subsidies encourage reforestation, and trees grow faster there
than almost anywhere else in the world. Brazil has some 1.5m hectares of
eucalyptus plantations, which can be felled after five years, compared with
10 years in temperate climates. Most of Chile's 1.4mha of man-made forests
are planted to Radiata pine, which matures after 15 years compared with 30
years in New Zealand, 40 in Sweden and 60 in Canada.
As a result, Finnish consultants Jaakko Poyry Oy expect Latin American mills
to squeeze out high-cost producers in the northern hemisphere and contribute
just under half of the world's increased production of cellulose - estimated
at 9m tonnes - towards the end of the century. With world demand for pulp
growing at an annual rate of 1.4 per cent, Jaakko Poyry expects Latin
America to command 30 per cent of international trade by the year 2005. At
present, it supplies about 15 per cent of the world trade in pulp.
Chile is well-placed to supply the fast-growing markets of Japan and
south-east Asia, while Brazil's strongest markets are in Europe. In Brazil,
the pulp-and-paper sector appears to have escaped the general malaise and
economic chaos afflicting other industries. Exports are growing so
vigorously that neighbouring Argentina was forced to introduce import quotas
earlier this year to protect its domestic producers.
Brazil's papermakers export about a quarter of their annual production of 5m
tonnes. Pulp producers sell almost 40 per cent of their 4m tonnes abroad.
Both exports are up by 20 per cent this year and are expected to earn
Dollars 1.5bn.
Aracruz became the world's largest eucalyptus pulp company in 1992, after
completing a Dollars 1.2bn expansion programme at its mill in the state of
Espirito Santo, north of Rio de Janeiro. With capacity at 1.2m tonnes a
year, Aracruz can now supply half of Brazil's short-fibre pulp, which is
used for quality paper and tissues, and 24 per cent of the world's total.
The company, owned by BAT's Brazilian affiliate Souza Cruz, Lorentzen and
Banco Safra, is also investing Dollars 100m to convert from chlorine to the
more environment-friendly oxygen bleaching.
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), Brazil's largest mining conglomerate, is
also investing heavily in the pulp-and-paper sector. Bahia Sul, a
joint-venture with Brazil's top paper manufacturer Suzano, started up this
year with a capacity of 500,000 tonnes. CVRD is also planning to double
capacity at Cenibra, its 350,000 tonnes-a-year pulp mill in Minas Gerais.
Its partners here are a consortium of Japanese papermakers. Mr Marcos
Montagna Carramota, CVRD's forestry industry chief, says the company plans
to start a new pulp mill every two years, to reach a capacity of 2.5m tonnes
by the year 2000.
Brazil's economic instability, however, is a serious setback for some
Dollars 5bn of pulp and forestry projects. Pulp manufacturers complain that
the government lacks a clear industrial policy, while inflation and
exchange-rate uncertainties are forcing them to postpone projects until the
end of the decade. 'If Brazil solved its economic problems, it could wipe
out all other short-fibre pulp producers in the world,' says Mr Eladio
Susaeta, an international consultant based in Santiago.
Chile's pulp industry also took a leap forward this year, with the start up
of three new mills which have more than doubled the country's productive
capacity to 1.5m tonnes a year. As a result, exports are expected to earn
more than Dollars 900m in 1993. Although Chile is now experimenting with
eucalyptus, its comparative strength lies in the production of the more
resistant long-fibre cellulose from Radiata pine.
Of the three new mills, the largest is Arauco II, a Dollars 600m
joint-venture between Brierley Investments of New Zealand and the Angelini
group of Chile, which will produce 350,000 tonnes a year. Compania
Manufacturera de Papeles y Cartones (CMPC), Chile's largest paper
manufacturer, inaugurated a kraft mill in partnership with Simpson Paper of
the US, which will produce 315,000 tonnes of bleached cellulose a year.
Santa Fe, owned by Scott Paper of the US, Citibank and Royal Dutch/Shell, is
the only eucalyptus mill in Chile. It started production last year, but has
been plagued by a shortage of raw material. Forestry experts say Santa Fe is
having to venture up to 400km away from its site in southern Chile to obtain
supplies of eucalyptus.
The three new mills are putting pressure on Chile's forestry resources, as
two-thirds of the 1.4m ha of planted pine are less than 15 years old. Mr
Susaeta believes the supply crunch will last another two to three years.
Other forestry experts believe Chile will have to double the acreage under
man-made forests to meet expected demand.
The dramatic growth in Chile's forestry industry has also exposed some
serious infrastructure bottlenecks. Roads in rural areas are poor, and
delays at congested ports are adding to export costs.
Compared with Brazil and Chile, Argentina's pulp and paper industry is
backward and inefficient. Almost half of the country's installed capacity
lies idle. Pulp and paper production, which totalled 900,000 tonnes last
year, is mainly for domestic consumption. Exports earned only Dollars 60m in
1991.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (7): Supplier to the supermarkets -
Profile: Jamont the pan-European consumer paper products group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RONALD SINGER says he would rather Jamont were not described as a paper
company - which sounds strange from the chief executive of Europe's second
largest manufacturer of tissue.
But Mr Singer was the man entrusted, three years ago, with forging Jamont
out of a diverse collection of 14 paper-product manufacturers scattered
across Europe. People listen to what he has to say about Jamont's corporate
identity.
'I consider us a consumer-products company,' he explains. 'We make the kind
of products that are sold in a supermarket.'
That means tissue, of all sorts, which represents 75 per cent of the group's
business, but also cotton products, feminine hygiene products and paper
plates. In the European market, only Scott of the US is bigger, with an 18
per cent share, against Jamont's 14 per cent.
More important for Mr Singer, an American, Jamont is a genuinely
pan-European group. It is a Dutch holding company, with its headquarters in
Brussels (to take advantage of Belgium's generous tax-breaks for
multinational headquarters), and subsidiaries manufacturing in 11 countries,
both inside and outside the EC. Almost inevitably, the group does all its
accounting in the European currency unit, the ecu.
Mr Singer believes that annual turnover of Ecu 1.2bn (Pounds 970m) to Ecu
1.3bn is impressive in any currency, and although he declines to reveal any
more figures, he says the group is 'substantially profitable'. If market
conditions are right, then a stock market flotation may be considered as
early as 1994.
All this has happened in less than three years. Descendant of a joint
venture between James River Corporation, the US paper group, and Ferruzzi of
Italy, Jamont was formed when the two original shareholders and Nokia of
Finland decided to pour their paper businesses into one company.
In January 1990, says Mr Singer, 'we had no legal existence, we had no
employees, we had no bank account, we had nothing. We borrowed offices from
shareholders and subsidiaries, and we began from zero to create a European
entity.'
From a manufacturing point of view, the Jamont companies were not an obvious
candidate for 'Europeanisation'. There is little benefit in transporting
low-density, low-value products like tissues or paper plates across long
distances, so there was no need to amalgamate plants. Existing facilities,
from Finland to Turkey, stayed put, manufacturing for distinct national
markets.
Instead, Mr Singer and his multinational staff concentrated on developing a
central administration, which could handle strategy, improve productivity
and secure financing for the 'new' company.
In this last area, Jamont has moved fast. Last year, the group raised a Ecu
400m syndicated loan as security for an aggressive investment programme.
Some Ecu 500m will be spent by the end of 1993.
The biggest benefit for the subsidiary manufacturers, Mr Singer believes,
has been the access to developing technology.
"None of the companies had been able to support a substantial technology
effort on their own,' he says. James River - which, together with Cragnotti
&amp; Partners, the Italian investment group, still owns 86 per cent of Jamont -
operates an open-door policy with the group on technology licensing.
In its turn, Jamont is ploughing funds into developing technology for
'de-inking' fibres, improving the quality of paper produced, and enhancing
the ability of machines to convert large paper rolls into more manageable
small rolls. Mr Singer claims that Jamont technicians are already bettering
the work done in James River laboratories.
For the future, Jamont has three important target areas. Mr Singer wants to
fill in the gaps in the group's coverage of western Europe - in particular,
Germany, which is dominated by the tissue company PWA, and where another
rival, Kimberly-Clark of the US, is trying to expand.
Looking further ahead, the group sees possibilities in eastern Europe and -
beyond 1994 - it may even start to expand into related areas of business
outside the core tissue operations.
Much depends on economic developments. As head of a company that has built
itself on firm European foundations, Mr Singer has been profoundly
disappointed by the unexpected turmoil in the European exchange rate
mechanism. Now, he says, his staff have to spend valuable time worrying
about European currency fluctuations, which he believed were a thing of the
past.
In general, however, he says Jamont will continue to benefit from the
stability of its underlying business: 'Bad times for us means when markets
are growing at 1 or 2 per cent, instead of 4 or 5 per cent.'
That apart, Mr Singer has one principal goal if he is to seek further
funding or a stock market flotation: to convince backers that this
Italo-American-Finnish-owned Dutch holding company with a Belgian
headquarters is not a European corporate aberration, but the shape of things
to come.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (6): Weaker krona lifts Sweden -
Regional report: Scandinavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 19 per cent jump in the shares of Sweden's forestry companies the day
after the country floated its currency last month said it all. Sweden's pulp
and paper groups were competitive again, after a year in which a strong
Swedish krona had seen them outflanked by rivals in North America and
Finland.
A weaker currency may not be an instant fix for all the problems battering
the highly-cyclical forestry industry - now very much in one of its down
phases - but it certainly helps. Finland has boosted both export prices and
volumes since devaluing the markka in November 1991, and it has gained a
further benefit from floating its currency in September.
Indeed, the currency changes may help make 1992 a turning point for the
forest companies of both Sweden and Finland. The two countries expect their
pulp and paper sectors to make a loss this year, but are cautiously
optimistic that 1993 will bring a return to profit. The benefits of
rationalisation, a stronger dollar and an upturn in the US market will also
be vital ingredients in any turnaround.
Prices remain, nevertheless, under strong pressure because of market
overcapacity. Sweden and Finland also face special competitive difficulties.
They have slower tree-growth rates, higher wood and labour costs, and a less
favourable tax regime than some of their rivals.
In Sweden, forestry companies have had one of their worst years for a long
time and are looking at a collective loss of SKr2bn (Pounds 193m) for 1992.
This compares with a SKr3bn profit last year and a SKr12bn profit in 1990.
As a result of devaluation, and assuming unchanged prices, the the industry
association calculates that companies will be SKr3bn better off. The
improvement would have been even greater if the UK, Italy and Spain had not
also seen their currencies effectively devalued during the year.
MoDo, one of the three biggest Swedish forestry groups, estimates that it
will gain SKr900m a year as a result of the weaker Swedish currency, though
not until current hedging programmes have expired in the second quarter of
next year.
Devaluation is not, however, the panacea it might have been 10 years ago,
when exports by the Swedish companies from Sweden accounted for some 80 per
cent of their turnover. Now much more of their capacity is based outside the
country, and Stora, Europe's biggest paper and pulp group, exports only some
24 per cent of its turnover from Sweden. Finnish experience has shown, too,
that buyers seek a cut from devaluation, putting further pressure on prices.
Swedish companies will certainly benefit from cost-cutting efforts put in
place over the last two years. Stora alone has shed 6,000 jobs since 1990
and is looking to cut costs by a further SKr2bn over the next two years.
Yet Mr Jan Remrod director general of the Swedish pulp and paper
association, stresses that devaluation alone will not not make the Swedish
forestry industry competitive. Sweden still has the highest costs in the
world, because of its wood and labour costs, high tax levels, and
environmental ambitions.
Finland, too, still enjoys a competitive advantage over Sweden because the
markka has effectively been devalued by 25 per cent over the last year,
which is much more than the drop in the value of the krona.
The Finns also benefit from state-of-the-art technology and have been much
more aggressive in cutting raw material costs. One estimate suggests that
Finnish wood costs have fallen by up to 40 per cent over the last two years.
Finnish pulp and paper groups have not been able to take full advantage of
their competitive position, however, because of the heavy debts accumulated
as a result of big investment programmes in the late 1980s. Those with high
levels of foreign debt have found their position exacerbated by the
weakening of the markka.
Debt-servicing costs and foreign exchange losses help explain why the
Central Association of Finnish Forest Industries expects the country's pulp
and paper companies to post a total loss of FM3.5bn this year. This is
despite a 6 per cent rise in export volumes and a 9 per cent increase in
export value, to FM39bn, during 1992.
For the first eight months, the country's four leading forestry groups -
Repola, Kymmene, Metsa-Serla and Enso-Gutzeit - were all in the red,
notching up a combined loss of FM1.7bn (Pounds 900m). For 1993, a modest
collective profit of FM300m is predicted, but this assumes a 7 per cent rise
in export volumes and a 12 per cent increase in value.
The debt problem remains a serious one, however. The large Finnish groups
have been forced to reduce leverage through cutbacks in capital expenditure,
as stock market conditions have not favoured equity raising.
For both Finnish and Swedish producers, the most worrying question is how
much further the European market will turn down, and how much further prices
will come under pressure. The concern applies particularly to the German
market.
'The first half of 1993 will be very difficult, because of flat or negative
GDP growth in many of the large European markets,' says Mr Denis Christie,
paper and packaging analyst at James Capel.
Against this, there is the expectation of a stronger dollar and a recovery
in the US economy, which should reduce the level of North American exports
to the European market and ease price pressures.
