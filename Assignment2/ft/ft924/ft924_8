SANYO Electric, the Japanese electronics company, has revised downwards its
profits forecast for the year ended November and announced plans for a cut
in dividend - its first in 22 years.
Sanyo yesterday said annual pre-tax profits would fall 73.3 per cent to
Y10bn (Dollars 80.64m). In July, it forecast a 35.9 per cent decline. The
company also expects to post losses of Y17bn at the operating level, against
an operating profit of Y11.3bn the previous year.
The announcement follows sharp falls in interim earnings at other leading
Japanese electronics companies, such as Matsushita Electric Industrial and
Sony. The severe downturn in profits also forced Sanyo to cut its dividend
to Y6.50 per share, from the previous term's Y8.
Sanyo is trying to restructure its ailing operations by giving more
responsibilities to each of its business sectors. Some 350 staff have been
transferred from headquarters to sales and marketing departments.
In an effort to quicken the pace of reforms, Mr Satoshi Iue, son of Sanyo's
founder, tightened his grip over the company last month by promoting himself
to chairman and chief executive officer, from the presidential post. Mr
Yasuaki Takano, former vice-president, has become president and chief
operating officer.
For 1991-92, the company now expects a 8.4 per cent decline in sales to
Y1,080bn, and after-tax profits to fall 72.1 per cent to Y5.7bn.
The company incurred foreign exchange losses of 3.2bn due to the higher yen.
Sales of audio and visual equipment dropped 18 per cent, due to weak
European sales, while a cool summer led to a 15 per cent fall in sales of
air conditioners.

FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Chicago pushes novel line in
catastrophes - The two new insurance futures launched today by the CBOT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chicago Board of Trade, the big US futures market, today launches two
innovative futures contracts that track quarterly property insurance claims
for losses from such catastrophes as earthquakes, floods, riots, tornadoes
and hurricanes.
But, in spite of a 15-year development period, the products may be too novel
for the US insurance industry, and may be arriving at a time when state
insurance regulators are discouraging 'creative financing' on insurance
company balance sheets.
The nation's largest casualty insurers, State Farm and Allstate, are not
participating in the index of claims reporting that underpins the futures
contracts. Only one state insurance regulator has said it will allow the
contract to be used for hedging risk, and then only on a limited basis. That
regulator is in Illinois, the CBOT's home state.
However, in another sense the CBOT's timing is impeccable. Insurance
companies traditionally lay off their underwriting risk through reinsurance.
A series of catastrophes in the past year - the Chicago flood, riots in Los
Angeles, and Hurricanes Iniki and Andrew - created enormous price volatility
and overwhelmed the reinsurance markets.
In fact, the CBOT shifted its focus to the catastrophe contracts only late
this summer, setting aside plans for less volatile homeowners' insurance
futures which had been scheduled for a September launch.
Mr Richard Sandor, executive managing director at Kidder Peabody in New
York, and one of the pioneers of financial futures, says the disasters
created capacity problems in the reinsurance business, and an opportunity
for the CBOT.
'What we're responding to is what is perceived to be a need for capital and
risk management in the insurance market,' Mr Sandor says. He expects some
reinsurance companies to be in the CBOT pits on opening day, but says
primary insurance companies have 'displayed healthy scepticism,' and 'don't
really know what futures are.'
Such resistance does not daunt CBOT officials. 'I can remember when 41
primary dealers of US government securities told me they didn't want
anything to do with a Treasury bond futures contract,' says Mr Leslie
Rosenthal, chairman of the CBOT's insurance subcommittee. 'Now we have the
biggest bond contract in the world, and every dealer uses it to hedge.'
The exchange will initially rely on its own stable of independent traders to
fill the insurance pits. CBOT traders have a natural affinity for disasters,
having bet their fortunes indirectly on drought, war and famine in the
Chicago's grain pits for the past century.
The CBOT hopes talks with regulators in New York, California, Texas, and
Florida will produce rulings that insurance companies can constructively use
the contract for risk management. In the meantime, Mr Rosenthal says
interest from offshore reinsurers has been growing. He also thinks that if
the futures contracts prove profitable, US insurance companies will find the
means to trade them.
Exchange executives note that most big insurers have financial trading
subsidiaries that are allowed to use futures. Allstate is under the same
Sears umbrella as Dean Witter Reynolds, for example, and Prudential has a
big brokerage arm.
The CBOT cites an industry study that pegs property insurance premiums
subjected to catastrophic loss at Dollars 41.6bn in 1990. However, Mr Marc
Rosenberg, vice-president of the Washington-based Insurance Information
Institute, says the size of the potential market for futures is much
smaller.
He says the amount of insurance premiums written for all property-related
coverages (excluding cars) is a little less than Dollars 80bn. Since
reinsurance purchases typically amount to just 10 per cent of gross
premiums, futures will be chasing a small portion of the estimated Dollars
8bn insurers spend on reinsurance each year.
Mr Rosenberg contends that industry scepticism stems from an apparent
contradiction: the exchange calls the contracts hedge vehicles, when US
insurance companies are not allowed to use them for that purpose. 'There is
a large gap between the (CBOT's) promotional materials and the realities of
the insurance business,' he says, dismissing the contracts as speculative
investments.
However, others take a more benign view. Mr Michael Pinter, chairman of
Kemper Reinsurance, one of the US's largest reinsurance groups, says: 'We're
being neutral at this stage. The concept is very interesting. The CBOT has
put a lot of time and effort into this, and we're going to wait and see.'
Mr Pinter says the main issue is whether the exchange will be able to
generate enough early transaction volume to make the contracts viable. While
regulatory hurdles are important, he thinks the contracts will survive if
they can prove their economic usefulness. 'The dollar potential is there,
and the volatility is certainly there,' he says.
The exchange starts today with national catastrophe insurance futures and
options and eastern catastrophe futures and options. It plans western
catastrophe contracts and health insurance futures in the first quarter of
1993.

<TEXT>
MR RALPH Willis, the Australian finance minister, yesterday raised the
possibility of an international offering of Qantas shares in the planned
public flotation, scheduled for next year.
Mr Willis said the international offering option depended on the outcome of
the current trade sale.
Both British Airways and Singapore Airlines have lodged bids for
shareholdings in Qantas.
Mr Willis also announced that the underwriters for the flotation would be
ANZ McCaughan Securities, County NatWest Australia, CS First Boston
Australia and Potter Warburg.
The bitterly-contested take-over bid by Campbell Soup, the US food group,
for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, has spilled over into the courts.
Campbell yesterday applied to the Supreme Court of New South Wales to
resolve an earlier agreement which may restrict Campbell's voting rights.
Arnotts asserts that the agreement, made in 1985, prevents Campbell from
voting more than 14.9 per cent of Arnotts stock, even if Campbell achieves
minority control of the company.
Campbell yesterday said it disagreed with this assertion and was seeking a
hearing to have the issue resolved. Campbell, which already controls 33 per
cent of Arnotts' shares, is bidding Dollars A8.80 a share for the balance.
The offer values Arnotts at Dollars A1.2bn (USDollars 833m).
Howard Smith, the shipping group, has claimed success in its Dollars A115.5m
takeover bid for Alexandra Towing, the UK tug operator, claiming 91.7 per
cent of Alexandra's capital.
The offer, which still requires clearance from UK regulatory authorities,
will remain open indefinitely.
North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resources group, has bought
Girdlestone Pumps of the UK for an undisclosed sum.

PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the Cincinnati-based consumer products company, has told
employees it is reviewing operations worldwide in an effort to make the
group more efficient and competitive.
Employees were told on Wednesday that P&amp;G was implementing a 'worldwide
project to review work processes and organisational structure'.
The company claims the overview is necessary because of a steady flow of
acquisitions - over 40 during the past decade - and geographical expansion
moves.
'We believe this is the right time to step back and . . . assure that the
organisational structure is matched to the needs of the marketplace,' it
says.
The company added that, although unable to predict the results of the study,
it does not expect 'broad-scale layoffs'.
It suggested that, if job cuts were found to be necessary, they could be
'handled primarily through reassignment, normal attrition and retirements'.
P&amp;G is setting up a steering committee, which will first analyse the group's
structure and then draw up detailed recommendations.

FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Chile woos multinationals to the
market - How banks want to transform Santiago into a financial hub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE bankers in Chile are forging a new line of business by persuading
multinationals to float their local subsidiaries on Santiago's buoyant stock
exchange.
Citicorp Chile and Bankers Trust Company have been sending emissaries to the
headquarters of US and European groups to expound the financial logic of
going public in Chile.
Their sales pitch has three main points: parent companies could raise ready
cash by carving out their Chilean businesses; they could finance
acquisitions elsewhere in Latin America by tapping Chile's substantial pool
of capital resources; and they could find local investors to fund their own
expansion projects in Chile.
Chilean banks want to transform Santiago into a financial hub for the Latin
American operations of multinational companies.
They believe this is possible because the spectacular growth of Chile's
private pension funds and insurance companies has created a domestic savings
pool worth Dollars 17bn.
Pension funds, the largest institutional investors in Chile, are on the look
out for new investment opportunities. They have recently been authorised to
take part in project finance and invest in convertible bonds.
As a result, the first multinationals are being coaxed onto the Santiago
stock market, or Bolsa. Armco Chile, a subsidiary of the US steel group
Armco, has announced it will be floating up to 60 per cent of its equity on
the Bolsa early next year.
'Armco Inc needs cash after taking the strategic decision to concentrate its
business in stainless and specialty steels in the US,' explains Mr John
Barroilhet, Armco Chile's general manager.
Bankers Trust persuaded Armco it could get a better deal by floating its
Chilean affiliate than by selling it outright. Business is thriving as Armco
dominates the Dollars 100m market for grinding systems in Chile's thriving
mining industry. The initial public offering is expected to raise about
Dollars 40m.
Mr Lincoln Rathnam, managing director of Boston investment consultants
Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, sees this as a trend, not only in Chile but
elsewhere in Latin America.
While Chile has the advantage of having a solid institutional investor base,
other stock exchanges in the region have benefited from economic reforms
that have wooed back flight capital.
'We are encouraging US companies to float their Latin American units as a
cheap and effective way of raising capital,' says Mr Rathnam. 'I expect to
see a lot of familiar names on local stock exchanges soon.'
According to Salomon Brothers Financial Strategy Group, US companies have
raised over Dollars 2.5bn in the past five years by carving out their
foreign subsidiaries in overseas equities markets.
To date, this has mainly taken place in Japan, where price/earnings
multiples are several times higher than those in the US.
Mr Jose Manuel Silva, vice-president of Citicorp Chile, says Latin American
bourses have become attractive as a vehicle for multinationals to reduce the
political risk of investing in Latin America.
Many multinationals are seeking to expand their operations in the region,
says Mr Silva, but they are being held back by weary shareholders at home.
'We are advising them to raise capital by floating their local business and
let Chilean investors assume the political risk of their expansion plans in
Latin America,' Mr Silva says.
Chilean electricity companies, for example, have raised over Dollars 100m on
Santiago's capital markets to buy large stakes in the privatisation of
Argentine utilities.
There is no reason why multinationals should not be able to do the same in
other fields, Mr Silva says.
Citicorp is pursuing flotation talks with about a dozen multinationals with
businesses in Chile.
Eternit, the Belgian manufacturer of construction materials, is expanding
its holdings in Latin America through Ceramicas Cordillera, a Chilean
ceramics group floated on Santiago's Bolsa last year.
The Belgian group and its new Chilean partners have just agreed to an
Dollars 18m capital increase in Cordillera to finance acquisitions in
Argentina. If the purchases go ahead, Cordillera will control 40 per cent of
the Argentine market for ceramic tiles.
A further incentive for multinationals considering going public in Chile is
that they often control businesses which are under-represented on the
Santiago stock exchange.
Public offerings from companies in consumer products, mining, and the fruit
exporting business would probably be snapped up.

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Semiconductor, the US chipmaker, reported its strongest quarterly
earnings in seven years, boosted by gains from patent licensing royalties.
But its operating performance failed to live up to Wall Street expectations,
prompting a sharp decline in the share price. National was down Dollars 2
5/8 to Dollars 10 5/8 at midday yesterday.
Net earnings for the second quarter, ended November 29, were Dollars 35.3m,
or 27 cents a share, against Dollars 5.9m, or 3 cents, a year ago. Results
included a net gain of around 15 cents per share from exceptional items.
The company recorded a pre-tax gain of Dollars 18.1m, including a Dollars
31.7m from patent licensing fees, charges of Dollars 4.5m for legal
expenses, and Dollars 9.1m for the costs of consolidating sales and
logistics facilities for international operations.
Analysts had expected net earnings of about 20 cents per share and were
disappointed by after-tax earnings from normal operations of approximately
16 cents per share. Gross margins were also slightly lower than expected.
The company attributed this trend to strong sales of its lower margin
products. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 491.9m, up from Dollars 413.2m
last time.
The results represent National's fifth consecutive profitable quarter, said
Mr Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive.
'We are continuing to consolidate manufacturing facilities,' Mr Amelio
added. 'We have agreed in principle with Defense Systems and Software of New
Jersey, to form a joint venture to operate our facility in Migdal Haemek,
Israel, as an independent operation. National will own less than 20 per cent
of the joint venture.
In the first half, the company reported net earnings of Dollars 57.2m, or 44
cents, on sales of Dollars 964.3m, compared with a net loss of Dollars
162.1m, or Dollars 1.61, after restructuring charges of Dollars 149.3m, on
sales of Dollars 824.2m.

BORLAND International, the California personal computer software company,
has cut its workforce by 15 per cent with the loss of 350 jobs.
The price war that has raged among personal computer manufacturers for the
past year has now begun to hit the software segment of the industry.
Borland said it would take a charge of about Dollars 35m against current
third-quarter earnings to cover the cost of the cuts as it consolidates its
operations.
'A new industry pricing model is emerging,' said Mr Philippe Kahn, Borland
chairman, president and chief executive. The re-organisation 'is designed to
make Borland leaner, more competitive and profitable'.
Borland, best known for its database management programs which enable PC
users to organise and access large quantities of data, is facing intense
competition from Microsoft, the PC software industry leader.
Microsoft recently launched its own database management program,
aggressively priced at under Dollars 100.
'The software industry is going through a fundamental pricing shift similar
to the one in hardware,' a Borland official added.
'We recognise this is a major trend in the industry and we have to be poised
for it.'
Mr Kahn said the company would launch two long-awaited database management
products early next year.

THE EQUITABLE, the large but troubled US life insurance company in which
France's Axa has a 49 per cent stake, said yesterday it was forming a
'strategic alliance' with UNUM, a medium-sized insurance company which
specialises in disability insur-ance.
The Equitable, which turned itself from a mutual insurance operation into a
shareholder-owned company earlier this year to boost capital, said the
tie-up was part of a general strategy of concentrating on 'core life
insurance and annuity business'.
Equitable's 8,300-strong agency sales force will sell individual disability
products 'based on product designs, administrative systems and claims
management capabilities developed by UNUM'.
The smaller, Maine-based insurer will reinsure a significant portion of the
insurance risk on these policies. It will also reinsure part of the
insurance risk on Equitable's existing individual disability business.
This arrangement will not include Equitable's open disability claims, but in
these cases UNUM will provide claims management services on a
fee-for-service basis.

STORA, Sweden's largest pulp and paper group, yesterday said it was selling
its power distribution operations as part of a strategy of concentrating on
core activities.
The buyer is AB Halsingekraft, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gullspangs
Kraft, which will take over the operations on January 1.
No price was disclosed, but general market prices would suggest a value of
around SKr300m (Dollars 44m).
The operations being sold supply 27,000 customers and include seven small
hydroelectric plants.
Stora also announced a further SKr350m in new investments yesterday, taking
its total autumn investment programme to more than SKr1.4bn.
Nearly SKr100m will be spent on the installation of oxygen-bleaching
equipment at its Skutskar plant for the production of totally chlorine-free
(TCF) pulp.
The aim is to have all production units within Stora Cell offering TCF
grades by the start of 1994.
Kone, the Finnish elevators group, has bought two-thirds of the shares in
Pragolift, Czechoslovakia's second-largest lift manufacturer.
The deal, on undisclosed terms, represents Kone's first acquisition in
eastern Europe, excluding Russia.
The remaining one-third of the company's shares will be held by
Czechoslovakia's National Privatisation Fund, the company's workers and
private shareholders.
Pragolift, which has a factory near Prague, specialises in the manufacture
of large passenger and goods elevators. and employs 450 people.
It was formed three years ago when Tranza, then Czechoslovakia's only
elevators group, was split. The other company was acquired by Otis, the US
lifts group.
Kone has exported lifts to the Czech market for a number of years.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, has recruited Mr Pierre Everaert,
president of the Ahold retailing group and one of the Netherlands' most
respected managers, to join its five-member management board and an expanded
13-member group management committee.
The surprise appointment is due to take effect on March 1. Mr Everaert will
be replaced at Ahold by Mr Cees van der Hoeven, who is currently finance
director.
After joining the group committee, Mr Everaert, 53, will take over Mr Ype
Bouwkamp's position on the management board when the latter retires on May
6. Company officials said that it had not yet been determined what Mr
Everaert's specific responsibilities would be, and added that there could be
a reshuffle of portfolios. Mr Bouwkamp is responsible for Philips' national
organisations outside Europe, among other duties.
Mr Everaert's knowledge of retailing and the US will be a welcome addition
as Philips continues to grapple with a downturn in its key consumer
electronics business.
The appointment of Mr Everaert is to be accompanied by the expansion of the
10-member group management committee to include three new members - the
heads of the medical systems, domestic appliances and communications product
groups.
Ahold, whose main business is operating supermarket chains in the US and the
Netherlands, said it regretted the departure of Mr Everaert, a Belgian-born,
naturalised US citizen who became the first person outside the Heijn family
to head the group when he assumed the job in 1989. The Ahold supervisory
board expressed confidence in Mr van der Hoeven and his fellow management
board members, saying 'their experience in the international retail business
will assure the continuation of the strategy and the successful further
development of the company'.
Under Mr Everaert, whose previous career was spent largely at Goodyear and
General Biscuits of the US, Ahold added a fourth US supermarket chain to its
business and impressed analysts and the stock market for managing to
withstand the increasingly difficult retailing conditions on both sides of
the Atlantic.

<TEXT>
FURTHER DETAILS have emerged about the ambitious Italo-American project for
a new multi-screen cinema chain in Italy, amid clarification of some
financial details.
The news follows the signing in Rome last week of a letter of intent between
Situr, the Italian property and entertainment concern, and UCI Europe, the
cinema group owned by MCA Universal and Paramount of the US.
Situr, which recently sealed a deal with the Standa retail group to develop
new shopping centres in Italy, expects to invest between L250bn (Dollars
179m) and L300bn in a series of multi-screen cinemas, which could be
developed alongside. The potential financial commitment by UCI Europe is
unclear.
UCI Europe, the first company to bring US-style multiplex cinemas to Europe,
has already built up a substantial chain in the UK, with cinemas of up to 15
screens.
Although Italy has one of Europe's biggest film production industries and is
the home of some of the continent's most famous directors, recent years have
seen the closure of many cinemas under the assault of television and video.
Mr Luigi Clementi, Situr's managing director, said the planned venture with
UCI represented a further step in the development of the group, which
earlier this year opened the L150bn Mirabilandia theme park near Ravenna,
Italy's biggest.
The company, which controls the Valtur holiday villages chain, is also
negotiating to buy CIT, the travel agency owned by Italy's state railways.
CIT is the country's only chain of travel agents, and a successful
acquisition would give Situr its first direct access to the retail travel
market.

TOPDANMARK, the insurance company, will proceed with the issue of 90,000
shares on December 16 at market price with no preferential rights for
existing shareholders, the company said yesterday.
Earlier this month, Top announced that its profits for the year would be
lower than expected as a result of heavy fire indemnity calls caused by the
dry summer, and turbulence in financial markets.
Top's share price is currently DKr645 (Dollars 106). At this price the
group's issue will raise DKr58m. The issue will take the share capital at
face value to DKr285m.

rise - Three drinks companies report varying levels of profits growth

<TEXT>
ELDRIDGE POPE, the Dorset-based brewer, continued its recovery from 1990
losses on hotel and computer ventures with a 46 per cent increase in
full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.61m.
The result was achieved in spite of 'bleak summer trade', said Mr
Christopher Pope, chairman. 'I am glad to say that trading has stabilised
into a more normal pattern since.'
Earnings per share for the year ended September 30 rose from 5.5p to 8.3p. A
proposed final dividend of 1.94p lifts the total by 23 per cent to 3.25p
(2.64p). Mr Pope pledged to increase dividends 'to their full former real
value as soon as earnings and prospects permit'.
Operating profit rose 12 per cent to Pounds 3.49m (Pounds 3.11m) on turnover
ahead 2 per cent to Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 42.2m).
Sales of cask ale rose 6.8 per cent, helped by a 10.4 per cent increase in
volumes of the premium Thomas Hardy bitter brand. Wine sales improved 6.6
per cent. Pub retailing profits increased by Pounds 400,000, with food sales
ahead by 9 per cent.
Exceptional items included a Pounds 1.1m profit on sales of capital assets,
partially offset by a provision of Pounds 400,000 against future
restructuring costs. Costs last time were Pounds 481,000. In the previous
year there was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 150,000.
Net interest charges fell 6.4 per cent to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 2.33m). A
write-down of Pounds 9.4m in the value of the company's properties was
charged to revaluation reserve.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: AIB agrees deal on insurance liabilities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALLIED IRISH Banks, Ireland's largest clearing bank, has reached a
settlement with the government on liabilities arising from its foray into
the general insurance business in the early 1980s.
Under the agreement AIB will contribute IPounds 8.8m (Pounds 9.4m) a year
from 1993 for 20 years, which will be matched on a 50:50 basis by the
government, to settle outstanding debts of the former Insurance Corporation
of Ireland which went into receivership in 1985.
AIB said the contribution will be equivalent to 0.8p per share 'and can be
borne over the period without reducing the capital strength of AIB'.
AIB had bought the Insurance Corporation in 1983 for IPounds 45m, as part of
a strategy to diversify into the general insurance industry.
AIB then found that the insurance company had 'significant
underprovisioning', mainly in its reinsurance business written through
London.
AIB injected a further IPounds 40m into the company before finally allowing
the government to take it over and pass it into receivership in 1985.
Under the terms of the 1985 agreement, AIB was to advance IPounds 70m for
repayment in the year 2000, and contribute IPounds 5.5m a year for 15 years
to meet the insurance company's liabilities.
Its domestic business was sold off in 1990 to a joint venture of AGF, the
French insurance group, and Irish Life. Its remaining business still faced
unmatched liabilities of some IPounds 270m in late-1991, so the government
approached AIB for further funding.
Mr Peter Sutherland, chairman of AIB, said yesterday 'The board considered
the bank's participation, and the finality brought to the issues involved,
to be in the best interests of its shareholders and staff, as well as
meeting the concerns of customers and the community at large'.
The 1985 agreement still stands under the new arrangement, but AIB was
emphatic yesterday that it now has a solemn agreement with the government
that no further contributions will be sought from AIB on the matter.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Fierce price war takes toll on outcome at
JFB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIERCE PRICE competition contributed to depressed profits at Johnson &amp; Firth
Brown, the metals and engineering group. Pre-tax profits for the year to
September 30 declined 19 per cent from Pounds 8.87m to Pounds 7.15m.
It also announced the appointment of a new non-executive chairman, Mr Martin
Llowarch, former chief executive of British Steel. He was named deputy
chairman in June and will replace 65-year-old Mr John Clay, who retires at
the annual meeting.
During the year the group experienced 'unprecedented pressure on margins';
competition was especially severe from Germany. In the current year, the
devaluation of sterling was expected to help JFB 'fight against some fairly
frightening price cuts,' said Mr Llowarch.
JFB was also taking steps to cut costs, including more than a 6 per cent
reduction in the workforce. The group had taken a Pounds 750,000 exceptional
charge in 1991 to cover the costs of rationalisation.
The final dividend is maintained at 2p for a total of 3p. Mr George Hardie,
joint managing director, said this was an indication that JFB did not think
things 'will get worse'. Earnings per share fell from 4.7p to 3.3p.
Two acquisitions - for a total of Pounds 3.5m - helped JFB increase sales by
4 per cent to Pounds 124.2m. The companies contributed Pounds 5.9m in sales
and Pounds 546,000 to operating profits. Mr Hardie said sales from
continuing businesses had actually fallen by 9 per cent.
The sharpest decline was in Firth Rixson, which supplies rolled rings for
engines to the depressed aerospace industry, as well as other sectors.
Operating profits tumbled from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 1.8m, on sales 8 per
cent lower at Pounds 58.3m.
Mr David Hall, joint managing director, stressed that business was not
expected to fall further, in spite of a hard-pressed aerospace industry.
Aerospace formed just 23 per cent of JFB's overall sales, he said, with
Firth Rixson increasingly concentrating on opportunities in power
generation. He also said the group was in talks on the acquisition of a US
company which would broaden JFB's product range.
The castings division saw a 9 per cent decline in on-going sales, and a 7.5
per cent fall in profits to Pounds 888,000. It benefited from an increase in
exports.
Light engineering, which manufactures products such as cables and machinery,
virtually maintained profits at Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 4.5m) on sales 12 per
cent higher at Pounds 49.4m. The increase came from the inclusion for a full
12 months of Cobden Chadwick, the printing press manufacturer, acquired for
Pounds 3.8m in November 1990.

Three drinks companies report varying levels of profits growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULLER SMITH &amp; Turner, the USM-quoted brewer, yesterday said that its
profits had been 'severely affected by the ongoing recession.'
On turnover ahead 7 per cent to Pounds 40.9m, pre-tax profits for the six
months to September 26 improved just 4 per cent, from Pounds 3.61m to Pounds
3.76m.
Once again, a strong performance in the free trade - draught ale volume
increased by 39 per cent - was offset by reduced sales in its own estate and
lower profits from the hotels and wine sides.
Overall beer volumes increased by 8 per cent representing a 'significant
increase in market share' according to Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman. Of the
company's three cask-conditioned ales, London Pride increased volumes by 23
per cent, while Chiswick Bitter rose 12 per cent and the premium ESB by 8.5
per cent. Exports jumped 38 per cent with the US proving particularly
successful.
The Chiswick brewery was currently operating at record levels. Mr Michael
Turner, managing director, said the installation of new mash tuns, due to be
completed next summer, would increase capacity to 160,000 barrels a year.
The hotels operation suffered from increased competition in the Heathrow
area which depressed the average room rate. Profits in the expanding wine
side dipped 13 per cent.
Earnings declined to 10.13p (11.62p) reflecting the return to a normal tax
charge after a one-off credit last time. The interim dividend is 2.4p
(2.25p).

<TEXT>
TAUNTON CIDER, floated on the Stock Exchange in July, reported a 32 per cent
increase in first half pro forma pre-tax profits, from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds
9.9m.
Strong gains in a buoyant market by its premium cider brands lifted
operating profits 17 per cent to Pounds 10.2m.
Earnings per share rose from 4.7p to 6.1p; and a first interim dividend of
2.4p is declared.
Proceeds from the flotation reduced borrowings from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds
1.1m, and interest charges fell by Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 2.2m, contributing
to actual pre-tax profits of Pounds 8m (Pounds 3.7m).
In contrast to the falling demand in other drinks sectors, the UK cider
market increased volume sales by 7 per cent in the year to September.
Taunton - dominating industry advertising with expenditure of Pounds 7m this
year - outperformed the market to increase its share to nearly 34 per cent.
Diamond White volumes grew 17 per cent and Brody, launched in May, sold 1m
bottles in its first six weeks.
In the draught sector, Dry Blackthorn recovered with a volume gain of 3 per
cent, and Red Rock expanded distribution from 3,000 to 7,000 pubs. Four new
brands have been launched into test markets.
A good apple harvest this year has enabled Taunton to buy juice 'at
favourable prices', said Mr Peter Adams, chief executive.
'Though market growth has slowed, premium brands are increasing share, and
we are well placed to continue to grow both sales and profits,' he added.

THE FINAL tranche of funds frozen in English accounts of the Central Bank of
Northern Cyprus at the request of administrators of Polly Peck International
has been recovered by the bank, its solicitors said yesterday.
The move means creditors of the collapsed electronics, fruit and leisure
company have lost all security over the funds.
Mr David Janney of Theodore Goddard, the solicitors acting for the bank,
said yesterday that the remaining Pounds 4.7m had been called down by the
Central Bank in the ordinary course of its business.
The PPI administrators had originally succeeded in obtaining a court
injunction freezing the British accounts of the Central Bank. However, in
subsequent litigation the so-called Mareva injunctions, named after the
first case in which one was imposed, were relaxed and subsequently
discharged.

Widney cut its loss from Pounds 512,000 to Pounds 313,000 in the 53 weeks
ended October 3 1992.
The underlying trend in improving operating profits was masked by final
provisions on old problem contracts inherited at Widney Aish.
Without such provisions, operating profits would have surged 80 per cent,
directors said. Instead, they were just 19 per cent up at Pounds 510,000,
and then had to stand interest charges of Pounds 823,000 (Pounds 941,000).
Losses per share were 0.87p (1.24p).
Turnover of the group, engaged in the manufacture of vending, water
treatment and power transmission equipment, fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds

Profits of the Novo Group, a provider of inventory management, storage and

Pounds 529,000 to Pounds 653,000 pre-tax for the half year ended September

The 23 per cent improvement came from turnover little changed at Pounds

Earnings dipped to 2.48p (3.8p) per share because of a greater number of
shares in issue and a higher tax charge of Pounds 191,000 (Pounds 38,000).
However, the company is returning to the dividend list via an interim of
0.3p. Directors expect to pay a 'significantly higher' final.

</HEADLINE>

   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHESSOE, the acquisitive engineering and pipework group, yesterday announced
a 13 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.3m, largely due
to the acquisition of a US company at the beginning of the year.
Mr Chris Fleetwood, chief executive, said the Pounds 11m purchase in January
of Varec, a manufacturer of tank gauges and vapour control products, had
been a 'reasonably significant' feature of the improved performance.
Group sales rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 79.7m for the 12 months to
September 30.
The final dividend is increased by 0.2p to 2.2p, for a total of 8p (7.2p).
Earnings per share at 26.3p were 8 per cent ahead, in spite of the Pounds 8m
rights issue to fund the Varec purchase.
The instrumentation division, of which Varec forms a part, improved
operating profits by 46 per cent to Pounds 2.7m. Mr Fleetwood said Whessoe
Varec had performed to expectations.
In the year to September 30 1991 Varec had produced profits before tax and
interest of Pounds 1.2m.
Piping systems improved profits from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 5.1m. This was
partly due to the inclusion for a full 12 months of Connex, acquired in
1991, and also to increased busi-ness from the gas-powered energy stations
being built in the UK.
The group's project engineering division suffered an 11 per cent decline to
Pounds 450,000. Mr Fleetwood said Whessoe aimed to sell or close this
business.
Contracts, and their accompanying risk, had become far too large for a
company the size of Whessoe, he said.
A provision of Pounds 600,000, which was expected to cover the costs of
selling or closing the division, had been taken below the line.

3.85m

<TEXT>
API GROUP, the packaging concern, swung back from losses to pre-tax profits
of Pounds 3.85m on turnover flat at Pounds 62m in the year to October 3.
Last time's losses of Pounds 470,000 were restated from profits of Pounds
703,000 because defence costs against the failed takeover offer from NMC, a
rival packager, previously debited as extraordinary costs, have been taken
above the line as exceptionals. Gross profit margins improved from 23.5 to
26.3 per cent, a rise of 11 per cent.
A proposed final dividend of 4.45p lifts the full-year pay-out 11 per cent
to 7.5p, which was forecast at the time of the NMC bid. It is payable from
earnings of 12.8p (restated losses 2.4p), 'the first time in three years
we've had such cover', according to Mr Dennis Holt, finance director.
Mr Moger Woolley, chairman since February, said the profits turnround was
due to operating profits up Pounds 2.01m at Pounds 3.71m, interest charges
down at Pounds 179,000 (Pounds 427,000) and a swing in exceptionals from a
debit of Pounds 1.74m to a credit of Pounds 321,000.
In the image enhancement division, operating profits more than doubled to
Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 1.11m), while profits from converted film and paper
products grew to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.1m).
The only fly in the ointment was the heating and ventilating systems
division which was affected by the weak property market. Profits fell to
Pounds 230,000 (Pounds 499,000).

restructure
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUNKELD GROUP, the small shirt manufacturer that has mustered the support of
the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board and the Bank of England in
its struggle for survival, yesterday announced a further restructuring and
two acquisitions, writes Richard Gourlay.
The Northern Ireland and London-based Dunkeld has convinced its bankers,
Hill Samuel, to convert Pounds 5.9m of debt into equity.
Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance, Dunkeld's advisers, is also raising
Pounds 1.7m in a share placing which will be at a price equivalent to 35p
after a share consolidation.
The reorganisation means that one year after Dunkeld nearly slipped into
bankruptcy, the Pounds 8.1m deficit on revenue reserves before yesterday's
deal is to be eliminated allowing the company to resume paying a dividend.
In parallel with the reorganisation of the balance sheet, Dunkeld is beefing
up its operations.
The group is paying Pounds 1.05m, mostly in cash, to Celestion Industries
for its Slix ladies swimwear business.
The company is also buying Tern Consulate, a private company that designs
and supplies branded shirts and is under license to Dunkeld. Tern belongs to
Mr Richard Lawson, a Dunkeld director, who is taking mostly shares in
consideration for his interests.
The IDB, which supports employment creation in the province, is also
converting Pounds 876,000 of preference shares into new equity, taking the
its stake to 4.2 per cent.
Dunkeld, formerly Aitch and before that Munton Group, also forecast pre-tax
profits of not less than Pounds 325,000 for the year to November 30 and not
less than Pounds 2.4m after extraordinary items.
Following the capital reorganisation Dunkeld will have a market
capitalisation of over Pounds 10.6m. Dunkeld's debt will fall from Pounds
13.1 m to Pounds 6.7m.

THE SALE of TVS to International Family Entertainment took another step
forward yesterday.
On a show of hands, shareholders of the company, which loses its ITV
franchise at the end of this month, passed a resolution to change the
company's articles of association which blocked anyone holding more than 10
per cent of the voting rights. The IFE offer is worth about Pounds 43m in
shares with a cash alternative of some Pounds 36m.
However, many preference shareholders are unhappy about the sale and believe
the opposition among preference shareholders might be strong enough to block
the deal.
Mr Julian Treger, of Restructuring Advisers, who speaks for a number of
unhappy preference shareholders called yesterday for further negotiations.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Midlands shows 24% advance - Improved
efficiency gives boost to regional electricity companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP COST reductions helped Midlands Electricity raise pre-tax profits by
24 per cent to Pounds 33.4m for the half year to September 30, in line with
expectations.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up by almost Pounds 44m to Pounds 661m.
The West Midlands-based utility is raising its interim dividend to 6.35p,
against 5.65p last time. This is expected to be about one third of the
year-end total (17.25p).
Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman and chief executive, said the strong financial
performance had been achieved while reducing tariffs, increasing investment
in the electricity distribution network, and continuing to improve customer
service.
The interim result reflected the seasonal nature of Midlands' business, with
the first half producing a weaker result than the second.
In the core electricity business, distribution activities earned an
operating profit of Pounds 61.2m, up slightly from Pounds 60.2m in last
year's first half.
The supply business lost Pounds 23.7m - an improvement on last year's
interim loss of Pounds 32.1m, which became a profit of Pounds 8m in the full
year result.
The retailing and contracting businesses were both in the black, with a
combined operating profit of Pounds 2.4m.
Mr Richard Young, managing director, said cost reductions played a big role
in the result. The company has cut its payroll by 500 in the past two years,
and overall costs were down 4 per cent.
Mr Peter Chapman, finance director, said gearing had been reduced to
virtually zero, with a resulting fall in interest charges. He expected to
repay remaining government debt early next year.
Midlands' policy would be to pay dividends on the back of solid earnings
growth which matched that of other regional electricity companies, Mr
Chapman said, although he declined to state specific numbers.
Earnings per share were up 20 per cent on last time at 11.3p.
COMMENT
The combination of solid earnings gain and further strengthening of the
balance sheet confirmed Midlands' place as one of the better favoured recs.
Key points in the result are further gains on the cost reduction front and
continued fall in gearing. True to its conservative style, the company
refused to be drawn into specific dividend forecasts yesterday, and the
pay-out was slightly below expectations, which may have accounted for the 2p
shed by the share price. However, the result gives only a partial indication
of the full-year outcome because of the heavy weighting of the second half.
Although the electricity supply business repeated its heavy first-half loss,
it was less than last year's and points to a profit in double figures for
the full year. The shares show a prospective yield of 5.6 per cent, putting
them at the low end of the rec range.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Recession blamed for ERF loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S deep recession in the UK commercial vehicle market, the most
severe since the second world war, was awarded much of the blame by ERF
(Holdings) for its descent into a pre-tax interim loss of Pounds 2.73m,
compared with a profit of Pounds 330,000.
Described as 'disappointing' by Mr Peter Foden, chairman of what is now the
UK's last quoted independent heavy truck maker, the result was,
nevertheless, little worse than the market had been expecting. The shares
closed down only 5p at 135p.
About one third of the loss was attributed to exceptional costs associated
with developing a new product range, the group's first sales expansion into
Europe and further redundancies.
Severe trading conditions in the UK, with heavy discounting further eroding
profit margins, was the main factor in a loss at the trading level of Pounds
1.77m after interest, compared with a profit of Pounds 612,000. Weakness in
some overseas markets outside Europe also took part of the blame.
Some analysts last night expressed mild reservations about ERF's seeming
determination not to slow the pace of any of its market expansion or product
programmes. Mr Foden said yesterday these would result in further
exceptional costs of about Pounds 1m in the second half of the year.
But he pointed to the first signs of recovery in the UK truck market and a
relatively mild deterioration in ERF's gearing, as justification for the
company staying on its present course. Currently, gearing was 26.7 per cent.
There is no interim dividend, compared with 2p, and Mr Foden said payment of
a final would depend on second-half trading performance.
The results were achieved on turnover of Pounds 54.64m (Pounds 58.42m).
Pre-production costs of the new truck range, to be launched next year,
accounted for Pounds 450,000 of the exceptional costs, including interest.
The setting up of a distribution infrastructure in continental Europe
accounted for a further Pounds 343,000. Redundancy costs totalled Pounds
152,000.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wage cuts as Archer dives to Pounds 938,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AJ ARCHER, the Lloyd's agency, is to cut senior staff salaries by at least
10 per cent as part of a vigorous programme of cost reduction.
'There has got be rationalisation,' said Mr Richard Maylam, chairman.
Reductions in staffing - which has risen to more than 200 following the
takeover of Kellett agencies - were not ruled out.
Details of the moves emerged yesterday as Archer announced a sharp fall in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 938,000 (Pounds 3.12m) for the year to September
30.
Earnings fell to 3.1p (8.7p) and although the dividend is maintained at 4.4p
with a final of 2.2p, Mr Maylam warned that shareholders could expect a
reduced pay-out next year.
Archer announced cutbacks earlier this year but is now preparing more
radical surgery in the wake of one of the most difficult years at the
insurance market.
Record 1989 losses of Pounds 2.06bn, which Lloyd's reported in June in line
with its three-year accounting policy, have depressed profit commissions
paid by Names to agents across the market.
At Archer, profit commissions fell from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 718,000 and
with further losses from the 1990 and 1991 years in store, the immediate
outlook is gloomy.
Operating expenses rose to to Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 2.41m), the increase
attributed to some Pounds 200,000 in costs arising from takeover
negotiations between Archer and Cuthbert Heath, a rival agency. The talks
were called off earlier this week after the two companies failed to agree
terms.
Mr Chris Burton, a director, said 'the impact of the cuts would be immediate
and permanent', although precise details were still being worked out.

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at London Merchant Securities, the property and investment
company, were almost unchanged at Pounds 11.26m in the six months to
end-September.
This was in spite of a 10 per cent increased in net rental income from
Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 15m.
London Merchant's earnings per share fell from 2.85p to 2.68p and the
company declared an unchanged interim distribution of 0.8p.
During the period, First Leisure, the UK's largest leisure group, added only
Pounds 1.8m to London Merchant's profits after the reduction of the
company's stake to 15.2 per cent since April 1991.
Lord Rayne, chairman, said that in spite of the fall in central London
office values there were encouraging signs of increasing interest in the
group's recently completed buildings.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Interest cut helps Sweb to 17% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WESTERN Electricity, the regional supplier from Bristol to Land's End,
yesterday reported steady growth from electricity distribution, but
disappointing results from Sweb Retail, its High Street domestic appliance
division.
Pre-tax profits increased 17 per cent, from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 15.9m, in
the six months to September 30, helped by a lower interest charge on reduced
net borrowings.
Mr John Seed, yesterday promoted from managing director to chief executive,
said electricity sales fell on average 1 per cent due to recession. But the
company continued to improve efficiency levels and remains on course to
easily achieve its three year target to cut costs 10 per cent by the end of
next year.
Turnover increased 5.2 per cent to Pounds 381.4m helped by average price
increases of 3 per cent, with a 1 percentage point discount for customers
switching to standing orders.
Operating profit from electricity distribution was little changed at Pounds
35.4m (Pounds 35.6m) despite a 6 per cent increase in sales to Pounds
107.5m.
Electricity supply, where profits are strongly skewed towards the second
half, incurred losses of Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 16.7m).
Sweb Retail increased sales 31 per cent to Pounds 32.8m upon integration of
the outlets of its joint venture partner, South Wales Electricity. But the
division reported a loss of Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 200,000), due to recession
and bad debt provisions of Pounds 1.2m.
Net borrowings were reduced to Pounds 84m (Pounds 99.7m), gearing fell from
25 per cent to 19 per cent and interest charges were Pounds 1.6m lower at
Pounds 6.5m. Tax took Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.2m).
Earnings per share were 19 per cent higher at 10.1p (8.5p). The interim
dividend is raised by 12 per cent from 5.25p to 5.9p.
COMMENT
Although the weather will still play its part, these figures suggest another
strong year for South Western. Combined operating profits from distribution
and supply increased 20 per cent, despite flat sales, as improved
efficiencies flowed through. The rise in the dividend, while in line with
other recs, looks confident. Longer term, the company must hope its
efficiencies, customer service improvements and 'underrecovery' of price
increases will stand it in good stead upon regulatory review in 1995. On the
downside, the company remains more highly geared than many in the sector,
and cash generation is weaker. Full year forecasts of Pounds 97m put the
shares on a prospective yield of 5.9 per cent, characteristically towards
the low end of the recs' yield range.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: British Land improves 12% and sees sound
outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH LAND, the property company chaired by Mr John Ritblat, yesterday
announced an 12 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds
11.4m for the six months to September 30.
Mr Ritblat, one of the most prominent investors in the property market over
the past two years, said he was confident about the market. 'I have not
altered the view expressed in June that the direct property market has now
seen the worst of the recession.'
The results reflected the emergence of some long-term benefits from the
company's active buying programme during the downturn, he said. He expected
a sound outcome for the current financial year. 'Unless buffeted by
accidents, financial or political, we remain well placed.'
The results, in line with expectations, together with a
greater-than-expected dividend increase, sent the shares up 4p to 174p.
Since the last year end, British Land has bought Pounds 78m of property
although Mr Ritblat said that an improvement in property yields had reduced
the flow of suitable investments properties.
The acquisitions included the outstanding interest of offices at Finsbury
Avenue in the City of London, Teesside Retail Park and Greyhound Retail Park
in Chester. In addition, the company spent Pounds 13m on updating its
portfolio.
Net rents were 17 per cent higher at Pounds 54.4m (Pounds 46.6m) while the
interest bill was Pounds 45.9m (Pounds 38.5m), excluding Pounds 1m (Pounds
600,000) of capitalised interest. The portfolio's voids remained at 2.5 per
cent, excluding two development properties.
Earnings per share were 3.8p (3.6p), up 5.6 per cent. The interim dividend
is increased by 10 per cent from 2.07p to 2.28p.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Compass makes Pounds 35m despite recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPASS Group increased pre-tax profits by 9 per cent in spite of the
effect of recession on both its healthcare and contract catering businesses.
The group, which failed to buy rival Gardner Merchant from Forte in the
summer, also signalled that it had its hands full attacking the UK catering
market and would only consider a move into Europe in the medium term.
Pre-tax profits in the year to September 27 1992 rose from Pounds 32m to
Pounds 34.9m on sales up 7 per cent, from Pounds 321m to Pounds 345m.
Earnings per share rose 9 per cent to 34.7p (31.9p) and the total dividend
is increased to 12.3p (11.4p) via a final of 8.11p.
A net Pounds 2.3m extraordinary charge covered the costs of the failed
purchase of Gardner Merchant.
Debt was reduced by Pounds 3.1m during the period from cash flow, but has
since risen to Pounds 72m as a result of the acquisitions of Travellers Fare
and Letherby and Christopher, the events catering business.
Operating profits from the contract catering business rose 4.5 per cent to
Pounds 27.6m.
Margins slipped from 10.1 per cent to 9.7 per cent, partly because larger
contracts were secured at lower margins.
New business helped sales increase by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 285.8m, in
spite of the higher number of business failures which meant there were fewer
people on site.
The Healthcare division increased margins to 21.5 per cent and operating
profits to Pounds 12.3m, in spite of a low occupancy rate and reduced demand
from self-pay or 'uninsured' patients.
Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said the National Health Service reforms
continued to move the market in Compass's direction and provided significant
opportunities.
He also laid out a strategy to focus the company's attack on the Pounds 6bn
UK catering market.
The business is being split into seven discreet marketing operations.
These will cover workplaces, educational establishments, prestige sites,
boardrooms, travel outlets, shops and hospital catering.
COMMENT
July's failure to secure the purchase of Gardner Merchant cost the company
kudos as much as the Pounds 3.1m of lawyers and advisers' fees. Yesterday's
results suggest the group may be leaving that substantially behind.
Operationally, its success in moving profits ahead, in spite of tough
markets, is impressive. What is more, the company's confirmation that Europe
is again on the back burner, and with it any threat of an imminent rights
issue, should encourage nervous shareholders. Interest cover remains high,
even though gearing is starting to take on a 1980s look, but this has much
to do with the small size of the balance sheet. Even though Compass has had
a good run, a pre-tax forecast of Pounds 37.5m, giving earnings of 37.2p,
means an undemanding prospective multiple of 13.3, cheap relative to the
market and even cheaper against comparable companies.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Improvements in mail order benefit Fine Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVEMENTS IN its mail order side helped Fine Art Developments lift
pre-tax profits by 10 per cent, from Pounds 4.49m to Pounds 4.95m, in the
six months to September 30.
Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, said that Express Gifts had added more new
agents through a successful recruitment campaign, and Mr Keith Brown,
associate director, added that orders there were up more than 40 per cent as
a result.
The mail order side was also reaping the benefits of past investment in the
Accrington site: customer service levels were improved and there was a
'significant' increase in order levels, though at lower average values.
Hope Education lifted sales 'in a difficult educational market', and Home
Farm Hampers was expected to make 'a very satisfactory increase' in the
second half where all its business falls.
Progress in the card and paper products division was more modest.
Group turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 120m (Pounds 109.8m), largely, said
Mr Chapman, 'by aggressive marketing'. Operating profits edged ahead to
Pounds 9.79m (Pounds 9.71m) because of lower margins, though the figure
included a Pounds 2.3m charge for the closure costs of Matador Paper Mills
and a Pounds 2.17m credit from the sale of the Next stake.
Reduced rates led to a fall in interest charges to Pounds 4.84m (Pounds
5.22m), though the group paid Pounds 4.4m to exercise its final option to
lift its stake in Grattan from 10 to 15 per cent.
Earnings advanced to 4.54p (3.86p) per share and the interim dividend is
raised to 3p (2.7p).

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: GUS shows 6% improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT UNIVERSAL Stores, the mail order, retail, financial services and
property group, increased interim profits by 6 per cent but said the
economic situation remained difficult.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 183.7m to Pounds 194.8m in the six months
to September 30, while sales increased by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 1.25bn
(Pounds 1.71bn).
The group said the home shopping side lifted sales by 5 per cent to Pounds
780.5m, helped by increased investment in warehouses, distribution and
marketing, and operating profits rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 81.5m.
Overseas retailing boosted operating profit by 24 per cent to Pounds 10.8m
on turnover of Pounds 83.3m, a rise of 6.4 per cent. South Africa produced a
good result, but the Canadian performance had been affected by economic
problems.
Sales of Burberrys products, including royalties, rose 10 per cent to Pounds
71.2m with operating profits were up 6 per cent at Pounds 12.5m.
GUS said prudent lending policies enabled the consumer and corporate finance
division to contain bad debt and this contributed to a modest 1.5 per cent
rise in profits to Pounds 62.1m on sales of Pounds 311.2m, a rise of 8.8 per
cent.
Reviews of existing leases saw rental income from the property division
increase by 11.9 per cent to Pounds 25.3m.
GUS said: 'The recent turbulence in the currency markets and rapidly
fluctuating interest rates represent a basic malaise in an unsettled
economic climate, making forward business planning hazardous and complex.'
Earnings increased from 49.2p to 51.4p. The interim dividend is 13.75p
(12.75p).
COMMENT
GUS's A shares closed 35p down at Pounds 16.18, reflecting both that these
profits were slightly below some expectations and the cautious tone of the
terse accompanying statement. GUS said sales since the half-year had been
satisfactory, but the volatile nature of trading made the outlook difficult
to predict. Net cash is above the year-end total of Pounds 590m. Falling
rates mean lower interest income, but the group contends that should be more
than offset by the impact of cheaper money on consumer spending. Overseas
earnings, accounting for nearly a fifth of group profits, benefited from the
translation being made post-devaluation. Forecast full-year profits of
Pounds 470m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 12.6. The shares
have had a good run from Pounds 12.80 in the past year, and were no doubt
overdue for some profit-taking. However, they appear to have little downside
at this level, given the group's consistent record of earnings growth.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Pilkington maintains dividend despite 70%
fall to Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON'S share price rose yesterday, but the directors were given a
rough ride when presenting the interim results to analysts.
They questioned the maintenance of the dividend at 2.93p, given that it was
paid entirely from reserves.
There was little good news in the figures, which showed a 70 per cent drop
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 50.6m to Pounds 15.1m in the six months to
September 30.
This was is in spite of Pilkington taking an annual Pounds 150m of costs out
of the business over the past three years, with a further Pounds 24m going
in the first half.
Group turnover of Pounds 1.2bn was slightly up when sales of discontinued
operations were excluded.
But operating profits of Pounds 46.7m compared with Pounds 89m, including
Pounds 19.4m from discontinued operations, mainly the South African
business.
Investment income and associates contributed Pounds 8.4m, down from Pounds
14.2m.
That left the interest charge of Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 48.6m), covered only
1.5 times. Exceptional items were Pounds 2.6m, against Pounds 4m, although
they are likely to reach Pounds 10m for the full year.
The group's tax charge of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 30.4m) was high because
losses in the UK - of Pounds 8.3m at the operating level - could not be
offset against tax paid on overseas profits of Pounds 56m. Advance
corporation tax on the dividend could not be offset either.
After minorities took Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 12.4m) there was a loss for
shareholders of Pounds 6.3m (profit Pounds 7.8m) or 0.8p a share (earnings
of 1p).
The shares added 3p to 87p.
Mr Roger Leverton, who became chief executive in July, said capacity
utilisation was about 85 per cent. Variable costs of production were low.
About 10 per cent of sales were of new, higher technology products
introduced in the past five years, which earned much higher margins than
standard products. Mr Leverton said he aimed to increase their contribution
to 15 per cent of sales.
Another aim was to continue to cut costs. Capital spending had totalled
Pounds 1bn over the past three years, but this would be cut, working capital
would be squeezed further and debt brought down.
Operating profits from flat and safety glass fell to Pounds 38.3m (Pounds
52.3m). The decline in European profits from Pounds 32.7m to Pounds 17.2m
and North American to Pounds 2m (Pounds 6.5m), was offset partly by a Pounds
6m rise from other areas to Pounds 19.1m. Visioncare, which includes Sola
and the US contact lens business, had flat profits of Pounds 11.6m.

THE TRUCE after the four-week battle to take Amstrad private came yesterday
as shareholders voted by a clear majority to keep the computers and consumer
electronics company in the public domain.
Out of Amstrad's 31,000 shareholders, 13,366 voted in person or by proxy
with 58.7 per cent against Mr Alan Sugar's proposal to buy back the shares
and 41.3 in favour. Mr Sugar needed at least 50 per cent of those voting to
back the scheme in order for it to proceed.
As the votes were being counted, Mr Sugar, who had already conceded defeat,
and most of the 150 shareholders attending yesterday's special meeting, set
their sights on the future, and focused their discussion on where the
company should go from here.
'Life goes on,' was Mr Sugar's response to a shareholder's query on what he
intends to do now that the company was not going to go private.
'I'll be there tomorrow in the office at 9 o'clock.' Any plans for the
company were the same whether it remained public or went private, he
emphasised.
Mr Sugar reiterated the need to shrink Amstrad's operations but refused to
specify which particular businesses the company would retreat from. 'We are
only going to produce and manufacture products that are going to give us a
margin,' he told one questioner.
Asked about whether the effort of the past four weeks had been worthwhile,
the Amstrad chairman responded philosophically. 'I'm a big boy. It was just
another business venture that was tried and didn't work.'
One shareholder wanted to be reassured that Mr Sugar would not now sell his
35 per cent stake. Mr Sugar replied that he had no immediate plans but that
if someone were to offer him, and other shareholders, 31p, he would accept
the offer.
Mr Sugar now faces a dilemma. If he manages to pull the company back to
profitability and the share price rises, he will be accused of having tried
to buy it back cheaply.
On the other hand, if Amstrad's shares fall further he has much to lose as
owner of a large equity stake. 'I'm stuck in a certain way,' Mr Sugar
admitted, adding that he would not stand in the way of the share price
rising.
But the man who was defeated by a small shareholders' coup, indicated he was
not ready to make many more concessions to those whom he dismissed as 'prime
karaoke candidates'.
He was equally dismissive of the company's institutional shareholders, some
of whom publicly slated Mr Sugar for the lack of independent directors and
the absence of any financial forecasts for the current year.
Amstrad has agreed to appoint two non-executive directors, but Mr Sugar
accused the institutions of 'gracefully burying their heads in the sand',
when they were offered the chance to vet potential candidates.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Eve halts three-year decline with 43% gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVE GROUP, the USM-quoted electrical and building contractor, turned in a 43
per cent surge in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 2.59m in the
six months ended September 30, 1992.
Turnover improved to Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 19.2m), while earnings per share
climbed from 12.8p to 18.3p. The interim dividend is held at 2.7p.
Although the group arrested a three-year decline in profits, it warned it
would not maintain the improvement in the second half.
Mr Gerald Hough, managing director, said results in the second half of last
year were exceptionally good and interim profits were boosted by the timing
of contract completions.
'Although profits in the current six months will not compare with either of
these periods, I am confident Eve will at least match last year's profits at
year-end,' he said.
Eve benefited from interest income of Pounds 300,000 and steady revenue
derived from its core electrical business: contracts were entered into with
the National Grid for electrical transmission line systems and more were in
place for 1993.
There were increased contributions from the group's Trakway division, a
supplier of temporary road surfaces and bridges, and electrical contractor
Arclive. The property development division was 'dormant' but could break
even by year-end.
Mr Hough said Eve had cash reserves of Pounds 7m, and was keen to make new
acquisitions in related businesses. The group bought Graham Brothers, an
electrical systems group, for Pounds 2m in October.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: African relationship turns rocky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TINY'S in town]' For three decades the cry has gone up in towns and cities
across Africa, from Cape to Cairo, from the lips of politicians, businessmen
or journalists.
If the pantheon of Africa's post-independence leaders allowed honorary
membership, Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's 75-year-old chief executive, could
take his place for granted.
Ready to nominate him would be Dr Hastings Banda of Malawi, Kenneth Kaunda,
Zambia's president until his election defeat last year, the late Samora
Machel of Mozambique and his successor, Joaquim Chissano, Uganda's Milton
Obote and Sudan's Jaafar Nimeiri, both in exile, Joshua Nkomo, Zimbabwe's
deputy president, and Daniel arap Moi, the Kenyan president.
Yet all the leaders are dead, or dying; exiled or exiting. Age has taken its
toll; but so has democracy, with autocratic leaders buckling under domestic
and international pressure and succumbing to demands for multi-party
elections.
It was with these men that Mr Rowland has worked closely; many observers
claim he does not have the same links with the new generation of African
leaders.
And Africa is changing in another respect. Structural adjustment under the
scrutiny of the IMF and World Bank is creating fewer opportunities to
exercise presidential power.
High hopes that marked the emergence of independent African states in the
1960s were dashed in the 1970s. Today those hopes are at their nadir.
All these changes have taken a toll of Lonrho's assets, however efficiently
managed. Post-Rowland, Lonrho as a company and Mr Dieter Bock, as its new
driving force, will find business in Africa harder and potentially less
profitable.
Lonrho has become increasingly dependent on profits from Africa. They
accounted for Pounds 150m out of group pre-tax profits of Pounds 207m for
the year ended September 1991. Activities include, in South Africa,
platinum, gold, coal and asbestos mining; motor dealerships, and sugar
investments.
Further north Lonrho has a wide spread of mining, agricultural and
commercial assets spread across at least 16 countries. Prominent is the
Ashanti gold mine in Ghana, but the list extends to tea, beer,
pharmaceuticals, sugar, farming, textiles, soft drinks, timber, paint and
hotels.
Yet questions hang over many of Lonrho's businesses:
Kenya's economic difficulties and political uncertainties put question marks
against Lonrho's hotel and motor vehicle interests. Plantations in
Mozambique depend on successful implementation of the UN supervised peace
plan. In Zambia, Lonrho companies are dependent on the success of a fragile
economic adjustment programme, as in Zimbabwe, where Lonrho has substantial
interests.
The future of investments in Malawi is heavily dependent on what happens
after Dr Banda, now in his mid-90s, passes on. Lonrho's companies in Nigeria
are hit by the economic crisis and uncertainty about the handover to
civilian rule.
Weak currencies, political risk, and hold-ups in remittance of profits and
dividends make many holdings worth less than their book value. In event of
sale, it would be difficult to repatriate the proceeds.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: A departure wholly in character -
The options open to shareholders in an uncertain future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS wholly in character for Mr Tiny Rowland that his exit from Lonrho
should be so hard to interpret.
It is unclear what direction the company will take when he is gone, or
indeed who is to run it. It is also unclear how far the deal is good for Mr
Rowland's loyal band of fellow shareholders.
The case for the deal is simply put.
Lonrho is issuing shares to Mr Bock at 85p. This is some 10p above the
market price. Existing shareholders are therefore better off, particularly
at a time when Lonrho is strapped for cash. Also, while some Lonrho shares
are evidently worth 115p - the price Mr Bock is paying Mr Rowland -
shareholders are being offered a rights issue at a mere 85p.
There are eminently respectable advisers to vouch for the deal: Deutsche
Bank for Mr Bock, through its subsidiary Morgan Grenfell. Royal Bank of
Scotland for Lonrho, through its subsidiary Charterhouse.
The case against is more involved, but not necessarily less persuasive.
The rights issue, being offered well above the market price, is designed to
fail. It is a technical device to secure Mr Bock's target of 100m shares
without breaching the London market's rules on pre-emption. This is
illustrated by the fact that while Mr Bock is underwriting 100m shares -
half the amount on offer - the other half is not underwritten at all.
In addition, Lonrho has undertaken that if enough shareholders take up their
rights to leave Mr Bock short of his 100m target, it will issue the
difference to him at 85p. Mr Rowland, needless to say, is not taking up his
rights. His entitlement has been assigned to Mr Bock for a nominal sum.
Although the 85p Mr Bock is paying is above the market price, it is little
more than half Lonrho's stated net asset value per share. How far that asset
value is realisable is an open question. But on paper at least, Lonrho
shareholders will have their net worth diluted, assuming they do not stump
up for the rights.
But while shareholders have no incentive to pay above the market price, it
is different for Mr Bock and his shadowy backers. They stand to end up with
25 per cent of the company.
Mr Rowland dominated Lonrho with a smaller shareholding. Arguably,
shareholders are seeing de facto control being transferred under their noses
for a very meagre premium.
The real premium, of course, goes to Mr Rowland, who gets 115p for half of
his stake. The rest can be bought by Mr Bock after three years at the
prevailing market price, apparently without paying anything for the option.
There seems nothing strictly improper about Mr Rowland extracting a higher
price in this way. It might be asked, though, whether it did not create a
conflict of interest when he explained the deal to the rest of the board. It
is understood that he did not vote at the board meeting in question. But
Lonrho is his company, and he is the dominant director.
Indeed, there is a defensive tone to Mr Rowland's own letter to
shareholders. His premium, he writes, does not represent any unfair
advantage, 'since neither my company nor I has ever dealt in Lonrho's shares
other than to buy them.' Either the argument is a non sequitur, or any other
shareholder who has never sold shares can apply to Mr Bock for 115p as well.
However aggrieved shareholders feel about all this, there is probably
nothing they can do about it. There is a striking contrast with Mr Alan
Sugar, whose modest proposal to buy out Amstrad's shareholders was turned
down yesterday. As more than one City observer has remarked, when it comes
to corporate infighting Mr Rowland makes Mr Sugar look like an amateur.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: A secretive tycoon heads for the
final handshake - Barry Riley examines Tiny Rowland's track record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 31 years since Roland 'Tiny' Rowland was recruited by Mr Angus Ogilvy,
then an executive of Harley Drayton's 117 Old Broad Street group, while on a
visit to Rhodesia to sort out the troubles of a minor offshoot called London
Rhodesian Mining &amp; Land. Soon Mr Rowland, a then-unknown Rhodesian farmer of
German extraction, had moved to London as boss of Lonrho.
Almost from the beginning he has left a trail of controversy, with
controversial takeover bids, eccentric obsessions and repeated insults to
the British financial establishment.
Mr Rowland's greatest financial achievements came in the early years as he
built up the company during the bull markets of the late 1960s and early
1970s. Relative to the UK equity market the Lonrho share price hit a peak in
1974. But it fell out of favour in the late 1970s and traded sideways during
the 1980s.
As Mr Rowland aged the company appeared to lose strategic direction and
during the past two years the share price has slumped because of rising
debts, sliding profits and slashed dividends.
His first major clash with the authorities came in 1973 when eight
directors, led by Sir Basil Smallpeice, resigned over Mr Rowland's cavalier
management style, including his presentation of a Pounds 307,471 expenses
claim (worth nearly Pounds 2m at 1992 prices). The affairs of Lonrho were
famously described by the then prime minister Edward Heath as 'the
unacceptable face of capitalism'.
After a probe by Department of Trade Inspectors Mr Rowland was censured for
misuse of company funds and was judged to deserve 'severe criticism' for his
conduct. Criticism was also directed against Mr Ogilvy, who resigned as a
director. Nevertheless Mr Rowland carried on, seeking shelter from
well-connected politicians.
Tiny Rowland has repeatedly thumbed his nose at the British establishment,
doing deals with the likes of President Gaddafi of Libya.
He has adopted an extravagant tycoon lifestyle, with a suitcase permanently
packed, and a pilot on standby to fly him in the corporate Gulfstream jet to
whichever African capital catches his fancy.
He does not take opposition lightly. There have been famous campaigns
against the Fayed family from Egypt and their alleged backer, the Sultan of
Brunei, and against the Australian Mr Alan Bond, who in 1988 had the
effrontery to try to take Lonrho over, but was repulsed by a 93-page Lonrho
document which alleged that the Bond Corporation was financially unsound.
Indeed, Bond later went bankrupt.
Mr Rowland accumulated mines, plantations, hotels, car distributors, the
Observer newspaper, the Wankel rotary engine and much, much more besides in
his corporate empire. But the greatest prize, Harrods, the famous
Knightsbridge department store, slipped through his grasp despite his
tireless feud against the Fayeds who snatched control of it from under his
nose.
A Department of Trade and Industry inquiry eventually proved that the Fayeds
had lied in their takeover documents but the department refused to take
action in favour of the man who had presented the 'unacceptable face of
capitalism' some 15 years earlier.
Tiny Rowland generated endless newspaper copy, but in many of his business
dealings he was notoriously secretive. While concepts of corporate
governance evolved towards openness and participation in boardroom dealings
by independent non-executive directors, he continued to stand for the
autocratic rule of the old-fashioned company boss.
Investment institutions mostly shunned Lonrho, but thousands of small
investors were attracted by Mr Rowland's charisma and the high dividends he
paid out. Now, however, those dividends have dwindled badly, the company
appears to be in a mess, and Mr Rowland's final gesture to his supporters is
to negotiate a deal which is specially favourable to himself as he heads for
the exit.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: The undisputed jewel in the crown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOR ALL Lonrho's multiple interests in Africa
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ranging from gold mining in Ghana to Kenyan hotels, Mauritian sugar estates
and Tanzanian tea plantations - the undisputed jewel in the crown is Western
Platinum, the world's third largest producer.
Situated in South Africa on the Bushveld complex along with Rustenburg and
Impala, the other two main producers, Western has been at the centre of
speculation for the past two years over some sort of closer tie between
Lonrho and Gencor, the country's second largest mining house.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, confirmed yesterday that discussions
on an ongoing basis had continued ever since Impala, the platinum arm of the
Gencor group, had put its Karee mine into Western in return for a a 27 per
cent stake.
Mr Gilbertson reiterated that although various options - including a
possible takeover of the Lonrho group - had been discussed, the primary
focus of discussions had always been in achieving synergies on the platinum
side.
His view remained that more could be achieved in this area to the benefit of
all parties, especially Lonrho shareholders. He added: 'I like to think Mr
Dieter Bock will come to the same view.'
Mr Gilbertson said the most recent discussions with Lonrho had been about a
month ago. But he said he hadn't personally been involved in any detailed
discussions.
It is believed that these were conducted mainly by Mr Bernard Smith, a
Gencor director and chairman of Engen, the group's energy arm.
The attraction of Western to Impala was, in the first instance, its
reserves. Two years ago Impala had a paucity of reserves, subsequently
addressed in part through acquiring a lease over the Deeps area and
purchasing the platinum interests - later mothballed - of Rand Mines. A
merger with Western would have solved this problem.
Another attraction was that heavy start-up costs would be avoided, since
Western was already in production and that it was in a major expansion
phase. It has also long been accepted that it is the lowest cost producer in
the industry.
On the downside is Western's high level of debt - estimated by analysts to
be in the region of R900m (Pounds 192m). There are concerns as to whether
cash flows are sufficient to fund interest payments on this debt.
Analysts ascribe this problem to extremely rapid expansion coinciding with a
sharp decline in world rhodium prices. Production grew from 274,000 ounces
of platinum group metals in 1988 to an estimated 690,000 ounces in 1992 - a
rate of expansion way in excess of anything contemplated by Rustenburg or
Impala.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: Observer looks to be in secure
hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESENT ownership of the Observer seems to be secure for the next few
years, in spite of Mr Tiny Rowland's plan to sell half his 15 per cent stake
in Lonrho.
All the signs are that Mr Rowland intends to stay on for three more years.
As long as Mr Rowland retains his influence at Lonrho it is unlikely that
the ownership of the Observer will change.
The Guardian has repeatedly expressed interest in the loss-making Sunday
news-paper, and earlier this year there were serious talks. But such talks
have always foundered on the opposition of Mr Rowland. He has in effect made
the paper unsaleable by setting a very high value on it.
The newspaper is now believed to be losing between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m a
year, losses that have been reduced from about Pounds 15m last year
following a cost-cutting programme.
Circulation has held up above 500,000 despite the effects of the recession
and increasing competition in the broadsheet Sunday market.
Uncertainty about the Observer was, however, increased by comments in Mr
Rowland's statement about selling his shares. He said that the board
intended to elim-inate intangible assets in Lonrho's financial state-ments
for the year ended September 30.
The statement also said that the Lonrho directors were of the opinion that
there had been no permanent diminution during the year in the current cost
of the remaining Lonrho title - the Observer. Its intangible value is in the
books at Pounds 67m.
Senior Lonrho figures suggest this makes a sale less likely because, as it
would almost certainly realise less than Pounds 67m, the difference would go
straight to the profit and loss account.
Others see the shedding of intangibles as the first stage in clearing the
decks for an eventual sale of the paper.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: The quiet man with clear ideas of
what he has to do
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO NOT confuse Mr Dieter Bock for one of 'our publicity seeking
entrepreneurs in the UK' said one of the advisers to the German financier
who is buying a big stake in Lonrho.
According to those close to him, Mr Bock has deliberately decided to keep a
low profile until after Lonrho's rights issue is completed.
'He has very clear ideas on what he might do but is keeping his powder dry.
He likes to remain quiet until he is sure his plans can work,' the adviser
added.
There are, however, two main areas in which Mr Bock and his advisers have
already shed some light.
When he signed the deal with Lonrho on Wednesday he made it clear that he
believed Lonrho's assets were worth considerably more than the group's
market capitalisation of about Pounds 490m.
In particular, it is understood that he feels he can realise greater value
for the hotels and property interests.
A German industrialist who has worked with Mr Bock on a transaction in
Germany said: 'Mr Bock is convinced that he knows how to realise the true
value of the UK-based Metropole hotels and North American-based Princess
Hotels.'
The Metropole Hotels have been the subject of controversy since the
government-controlled Libyan Arab Finance Company took a one third stake for
Pounds 177.5m earlier this year.
When asked about the Libyan stake on Wedndesday evening, Mr Bock said: 'Who
knows what will happen to their shareholding. All things can change. The
company has suffered enough in respect of that stake.'
It is also clear that Mr Bock is only expected to take up a directorship at
Lonrho if the board agrees that he should become joint chief executive with
Mr Tiny Rowland.
Even before Mr Bock's arrival, the old guard surrounding Mr Rowland has
begun to leave. Mr Roger Badger, a director, has just resigned and others
may follow.
'There may have to be an infusion of new management under Mr Bock since the
current generation are getting close to retirement age,' the adviser said.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Damage limitation in the heart of Paris: The defence by
French banks against the collapse in Parisian property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French financial establishment's capacity to get itself out of a fix is
facing its toughest test for years.
Banks and insurance companies are closing ranks in an attempt to reduce the
damage from the up to FFr80bn (Pounds 9.6bn) of estimated doubtful debts in
their property loan portfolios. The threat to their balance sheets is so
serious that the government, owner of two of the three biggest banks and
three top insurers, plans to announce measures by the end of next week to
help the ailing property industry. These could also include some form of
refinancing for the worst-hit bank lenders and investors.
France's property decline, which has already forced banks to make heavy
provisions on dud loans, is happening for similar reasons to its equivalent
in the US, Japan and Britain. However, the final outcome will be less
catastrophic, partly because the market is less hard hit than elsewhere and
because the decline has been concentrated on the capital.
Average rentals on Paris commercial property have dropped 20 per cent in
three years, though the decline is less bad in the 'Golden Triangle' around
the Champs-Elysees. Today, the average commercial vacancy rate in the
capital is only 6 per cent, rising to 12 per cent in the office district of
La Defense.
The close ownership and business links between all those involved has also
helped. 'The fact that the market is operated in concert means that the risk
of a catastrophic drop in values is very limited,' says Mr David Robinson,
partner in the Paris office of Richard Ellis, the property consultants. 'The
fundamental difference is that there is no such thing as a free independent
developer here. They all have a very close relationship with their banks.'
A property analyst says: 'The banks are hardly going to pull the rug from
under the developers, because they would only be pulling the rugs from under
themselves. In many cases they are the developers. Thanks to this, Paris
will not have an Olympia and York.' Credit Lyonnais, Paribas, Banque
Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale all have stakes in property
developers, to which they have also lent heavily.
On the surface, French banks face a serious property headache. Estimates of
their outstanding property loans vary widely from FFr250bn, by the Paris
commercial court, to FFr400bn or FFr500bn, by Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman
of Paribas, and Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez. There are no centrally
gathered figures.
Estimates of the losses they face also vary. Mr Worms and Mr Levy-Lang
recently warned that banks could face losses of between FFr45bn and FFr70bn
on their property loans, while Mr Didier Rougier, president of the
commercial court, believes the final write-down could be as much as FFr80bn.
Banks have already set aside FFr20bn of provisions for dud property loans
against their profits, but that covers only half the damage, according to
James Capel in Paris.
To make matters worse, this lending is concentrated in the hands of a few,
with nearly FFr123bn outstanding from Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit
Lyonnais, Societe Generale, Paribas and Suez alone. This contrasts with the
UK, where foreign banks made more than half of property loans before the
crisis hit, or the US where the damage was spread through the savings and
loans institutions.
Heads have rolled among the unfortunates responsible for bad loans and
investments. The past year has seen the departures of the head of Banque
Indosuez's property development arm and the chairman of Banque Worms, the
UAP insurance group subsidiary crippled by bad property loans.
French financial institutions have tried to defray or delay losses on
property investments and loans by rescheduling some property loans; turning
others into equity to be held by their property investment units; setting up
sale and leasebacks; and occupying borrowers' empty buildings.
They have also offered potential tenants rent-free periods. Another
sweetener is to offer soft loans to potential purchasers, as Indosuez has
done with the NMPP building, which it bought from Hachette for FFr2.7bn in
1990, only to declare a FFr1bn provision on the building a year later. It is
now trying to sell the building as eight lots, five of which have gone, with
the help of a 5 per cent loan, to a Middle Eastern property developer who
happens to have a stake in the bank.
Insurers, which have substantial property investment portfolios, have been
busy recently exchanging Parisian office buildings at high valuations each
other, worth several billion francs in the last month alone according to one
institutional investor.
Typically the buildings concerned were last valued a decade ago, so the
process enables insurers to register capital gains to cover losses on
insurance claims on their banking businesses. Analysts suspect this might
also help prop up property values, a theory denied by one leading insurer,
who says it is a legitimate way of realising capital gains on long-held and
undervalued properties.
Even so, several analysts fear that even after the recent write-offs, French
banks and insurance companies could be carrying some of the property loans
and investments they made at the peak of the upturn at the end of the 1980s
at unrealistically high valuations.
They face the choice of declaring another round of heavy write-downs next
year, or keeping them at current values until the property market recovers.
'It's really a question of accepting the loss now or putting it off till
another time,' says Richard Ellis' Mr Robinson.

FT  11 DEC 92 / County NatWest withdraws from Tokyo Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE collapse of the Tokyo stock market yesterday claimed its most notable
victim among foreign stockbrokers as County NatWest, the securities arm of
National Westminster Bank, became the first to announce a total withdrawal
from the market.
County will be the first foreign broker to give up its membership on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, which it obtained in 1988 after pressure had been put
on the Japanese authorities by the UK government.
County's move comes as profits at Japanese and foreign brokers have been
savaged by the slump of the Tokyo stock market. For the first-half to last
September, the 25 foreign members of the TSE posted a 40 per cent fall in
combined pre-tax profits to Y30bn (Pounds 155.2m). County reported a loss of
Y2.57bn in the year to March.
Mr Scott Dobbie, vice-chairman of County NatWest Securities, said the level
of business in Tokyo was not sufficient to cover high overhead costs. He
said it was unlikely that Tokyo's stock market would return to the volumes
and the profitability of the late 1980s. County's move will result in the
loss of 70 out of 75 jobs.
Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the TSE, said he regretted County's decision
to relinquish its seat on the exchange. Prudential Securities of the US
recently realigned its Japanese equity operations, but said it would retain
its TSE membership. Until now, other foreign brokers have also chosen to
hold on to their memberships, which were only won after political pressure.
County's withdrawal is also a sign of the failure by foreign brokers to
instil in Japanese investors a taste for the research services used in
Europe and the US. In the 1980s, western brokers claimed that their research
approach would give them a strong position in selling Japanese stocks to
local investors.
Most foreign brokers have decided to concentrate on trading derivatives,
taking advantage of disparities between prices in the futures market and in
the underlying stock markets. However, profitability of this business has
also fallen. Daily trading of Nikkei 225 stock index futures plunged 48 per
cent on the Osaka Stock Exchange in the six months to September.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Concern over Lonrho share deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Lonrho, the international trading group, yesterday fell 4p to 75p
as investors indicated they would not be taking up shares in its rights
issue because of uncertainty surrounding the deal with the German financier
Mr Dieter Bock.
Shareholders also voiced concern about the group's rise in net debt to
Pounds 947m and the fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 205m to Pounds 79m,
for the year ended September 30.
Two of Lonrho's institutional shareholders said financial information given
to Mr Bock should be made available to all shareholders.
Morgan Grenfell, which is advising Mr Bock, sought and obtained 'pieces of
information' from Lonrho which are not in the public domain. This was to
enable Mr Bock to make a decision about whether to invest in Lonrho.
Mr Bock made it clear that he was then given a choice 'to take or leave'
half of the 15 per cent stake owned by Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief
executive, at 115p each - compared with 85p a share in the rights issue. Mr
Bock said he thought he bought Mr Rowland's shares 'at a resonable price'.
However, one of Lonrho's institutional shareholders said: 'We would like to
know what information was given to Mr Bock for him to decide that 115p a
share is a reasonable price to pay'.
Mr Bock is to underwrite half the 200m shares in the 3-for-10 rights issue
at 85p a share, take up the rights of Mr Rowland and buy his existing
shares.
Mr Bock will end up with a maximum 19 per cent stake in Lonrho if no
shareholders take up the rights issue. This will rise to 25 per cent when he
buys the other half of Mr Rowland's 15 per cent stake in three year's time.
Meanwhile, Gencor, South Africa's second-biggest mining house, yesterday
said it was still interested in buying Lonrho's Western Platinum mine in
spite of the international trading group's deal with Mr Bock.
Although Gencor and Lonrho had been in merger talks, Mr Brian Gilbertson,
Gencor's chairman, said he did not believe a takeover of Lonrho was the
'natural route' for Gencor.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Pilkington raids reserves for dividend: Sales fall - Losses
increase to Pounds 29m / Chairman says group feels 'optimistic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glass group, surprised the stock market by maintaining its
2.93p a share interim dividend, although the Pounds 22.9m payment had to be
made entirely from reserves. In all, the group recorded a Pounds 29.2m
retained loss for the half-year to end September compared with a Pounds 15m
loss. The shares rose 3p to 87p on relief that the payout had not been cut.
However, the group cut 1,500 jobs in the half-year, of which 300 went in the
UK, and about another 4,000 will go within two years.
Group sales in the half-year were Pounds 1.2bn, down from Pounds 1.3bn, and
pre-tax profits were Pounds 15.1m, down from Pounds 50.6m.
Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said: 'We feel marginally more optimistic
than we did. Everything we are seeing is trending in the right direction.'
In June the group cut its dividend and then Sir Antony said that there was
no sign of a recovery in trading conditions.
Yesterday Sir Antony said that a decision on the total dividend for the
current financial year would be made in June when annual results are
announced.
The group also announced plans to sell Sola Group, its spectacle lens
business, to cut borrowings which stood at Pounds 780m at September 30, up
from Pounds 659m at the year-end, excluding Pounds 100m of finance leases.
Sterling's fall added Pounds 50m to borrowings on translation of overseas
debt.
After high levels of spending over recent years, the group now aimed to keep
capital expenditure at 80 per cent of the depreciation charge, now around
Pounds 140m a year.
Analysts criticised the decision to hold the dividend, calling it imprudent.
They said the planned disposal of Sola, which made a trading profit of
Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds 85m in the half-year, was a matter of selling
a good business to prop up the balance sheet. Analysts estimated Sola could
fetch Pounds 150m to Pounds 200m.
Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington's new chief executive, said the downward trend
in glass prices had been less steep in the half-year, although prices were
down 8 per cent between September 1991 and this September. He said a 1
percentage point movement in prices was worth Pounds 7.5m to profits.
In the UK, the fall in sterling since mid-September was helping Pilkington
to rebuild its UK market share which had suffered because of imports.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Lamont rules out early cut in interest rates: Treasury
report notes flickers of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chan-cellor, yesterday ruled out an early cut in UK
base rates after a Treasury report noted flickers of recovery in the UK
economy.
In the first of its monthly monetary reports, the Treasury highlighted a
string of positive signs for the economy, including stronger retail sales
and money supply growth, but said these stood in contrast to depressed
consumer and business confidence.
The report, part of an initiative to reduce secrecy in economic
policymaking, said consumer spending showed no signs of weakening following
sustained growth in the money supply since July. After it was released, Mr
Lamont said it was right to be cautious on interest rates while the economy
was showing 'encouraging signs', but warned against over-optimism.
'It is always extremely difficult to spot the turning point and we have had
some false dawns before, as the world well knows,' he said. 'We have seen
narrow money move to the top of the target range and I think it is right to
be cautious.'
The report pointed to upwards trends in retail sales, car registrations,
exports and imports. It also highlighted less promising signals.
Unemployment would continue to rise for the near future, it said, and the
housing market showed no sign of a recovery.
Although the report drew no conclusions on whether the economy was
recovering, Mr Lamont said he had 'no doubt' the country was benefiting from
recent interest rate reductions. The full effect of cuts in mortgage
interest rates would become apparent in January when reduced charges would
apply for owner-occupiers whose repayments change on an annual basis.
However, the Treasury is expected today to receive a downbeat view about
growth next year from its economics prospects panel, set up earlier this
year to improve contacts between the Treasury and the business world.
According to the report, world inflationary pressures remain subdued.
Underlying inflation and earnings growth continue to decline, it said, even
though October saw the first effects of sterling's depreciation in higher
import prices and a pick-up in producer input price inflation.
Mr Lamont emphasised that recovery was 'strongly under way' in the US and
said a bigger proportion of British exports went to that market than those
of any EC country.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said: 'Buried in the Treasury's new
report is the admission that unemployment is rising and the property market
still declining. The chancellor must now admit that unless action is taken,
300,000 more jobs are at risk.'
Economists, who had been hoping for more commentary and analysis, said they
were disappointed with the report.
'It doesn't really get us any closer to Treasury thinking,' said Mr Roger
Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Somalia fighting claims two lives as troops battle gunmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST two Somalis were killed and 14 injured when US Marines and French
foreign legionnaire paratroopers exchanged fire with freelance gunmen and
bandits last night in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
The clash, the most serious since foreign troops took the capital on
Wednesday, came as Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, told a Nairobi news conference that some of the US-led
force could stay in Somalia for up to a year.
'US military involvement will be limited,' said Mr Cohen, 'but troops will
liaise with the UN with a view to establishing some form of governmental
authority.' It would take 'between six and 12 months'.
The US force in Mogadishu said it had arranged talks between the two most
important rival warlords whose power struggle has reduced the city to
rubble. Gen Mohamed Farar Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed agreed to meet for
the first time in 13 months today at the gutted US embassy compound.
But Mr Robert Oakley, the US special envoy now in Somalia, was adamant that
the US would not be involved 'in drawing the possible political architecture
for the future of Somalia'.
In a television interview from Mogadishu, he said today's meeting was not
'political' and was mostly designed to discuss immediate security-related
issues. Somalia's future, he added, was 'a UN mission' in which the US would
offer what help it could but not, he implied, take the lead.
One purpose of the meeting, he said, was to look into how best to get
Somalis to turn in their weapons. He did not rule out house-to-house
searches by the coalition forces, but hoped some less intrusive approach
might work. Payment of bounties to those surrendering guns has also not been
ruled out in Washington. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general,
said in New York that he was inviting Gen Aideed and Mr Mahdi to a further
meeting, in Addis Ababa next month, in a new attempt at national
reconciliation. Representatives of the clans and international aid officials
would also be asked to attend.
The moves have brought Somalia closer to the status of a UN trusteeship.
This reflects the hardening belief that a political initiative must run in
parallel with the relief exercise. The alternative, say African and other
diplomats, is that Somalia would revert to violence as soon as the
international force withdrew.
As UN forces imposed some order in Mogadishu, a US expeditionary force
checked out the airstrip at the former Somali air force base of Baidogley,
110 miles away. Aid agencies called on US forces to deploy rapidly into the
towns of Kismayo and Baidoa which have been engulfed in looting and warfare,
leaving at least 60 dead in the past four days.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Clinton names five who will shape US economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday reached into Congress and Wall
Street for five senior positions on the team that will shape his
administration's economic policies.
In unveiling his nominees, whom he described as 'seasoned, skilled and
incredibly able', Mr Clinton repeatedly emphasised that sustainable economic
growth was contingent on 'a serious, credible, long-term deficit reduction
policy'.
As expected, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the 71-year-old senator from Texas and
chairman of the Senate finance committee, becomes Treasury secretary, with
Mr Roger Altman, 46, of the Blackstone Group, Wall Street investment banker,
as his deputy.
Congressman Leon Panetta from California, 54, and chairman of the House
budget committee, will take over as director of the Office of Management and
Budget. Dr Alice Rivlin, 61, who is attached to the Brookings Institution,
will be Mr Panetta's deputy.
Mr Robert Rubin, also 54, and co-chairman of Goldman Sachs Wall Street
investment bank, takes the new position of economic counsellor to the
president, operating from the White House.
Mr Clinton did not yesterday name a new head of the Council of Economic
Advisers, as some had expected, but said this did not mean he intended to
downgrade the CEA, which he said would continue to provide independent
economic consultation and advice.
Mr Rubin's job, he added, was to be co-ordinator of a new economic advisory
body under the president's chairmanship and analogous to the existing
National Security Council. Its members would include those named yesterday
and other hitherto unrepresented cabinet departments, such as commerce,
labour and the interior.
Mr Bentsen, Mr Panetta and Dr Rivlin bring formidable qualifications and
congressional experience in budgetary matters to the new administration, an
indication of Mr Clinton's determination to tackle the deficit of more than
Dollars 300bn (Pounds 197bn) while pursuing the goals of 'a high wage, high
growth, strong and vital economy'.
Mr Panetta, for example, is known as a deficit-reduction 'hawk'. Dr Rivlin,
the only economist of the five, set up the independent Congressional Budget
Office in 1975.

FT  11 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a slightly unnerving message for the market as a whole in the 9 per
cent fall in Guinness's share price over the past two days. The company is
starting to feel the chill spreading through the European economy.
September's devaluation will do little for earnings for the time being
because export revenues were hedged, a factor which also protected Guinness
from the weakness of the dollar earlier in the year. But European consumers,
particularly in Germany, are spending less on spirits. Added to that,
Guinness has a particular problem in Spain where the rationalisation of its
brewery acquisitions is proving more difficult than expected. It has lost
both market share and margin in a declining beer market.
The upshot is that Guinness may, for once, see a decline in profits this
year and the chances of it generating over Pounds 1bn in 1993 are remote.
This realisation, prompted by a wire agency interview on Wednesday, took the
market by surprise, so the share price fall could be seen as a one-off
adjustment to lowered expectations which may not have much further to run.
The harder question is whether Guinness has lost its magic touch for good.
There is no reason why recession should have blighted the long-term growth
prospects of the international spirits sector, but declining inflation may
leave consumers in the industrial world more price conscious for a while.
With earnings growth next year unlikely to match the market average, it is
hard to see the share price outperforming even from a lower base.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power and PowerGen must be starting to sweat. Professor
Littlechild's exoneration of the regional electricity companies for buying
gas-fired power is not bad news in itself. Those most involved in the dash
for gas, notably Southern Electric and Norweb, will doubtless be relieved.
The generators are big enough to stand the competition. They can, however,
hardly be pleased to find the regulator digging deeper to see whether the
coal-fired contracts which they offered as an alternative to gas fairly
reflected costs.
In one respect the generators - and the coal lobby for that matter - might
justifiably feel hard done by. In looking at coal-fired power contracts
covering peak demand against gas-fired contracts covering only basic demand,
the regulator is not comparing like with like. One can only trust the full
report promised by the end of January takes this point on board. Regardless
of the arithmetic, though, Professor Littlechild appears set on a collision
course with the generators.
Since the generators enjoy freedom from price-based regulation, the market
is right to be nervous. The results of an investigation into the electricity
pool price are already due before Christmas. Yesterday's missive opens a
second front. If National Power or PowerGen are found to be overcharging
through either contracts or the pool, Professor Littlechild will have little
choice but to act. At best that means intervention on prices, at worst a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  11 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no doubt that Pilkington is still suffering from the nasty volume
swings that periodically disfigure its industry, as yesterday's 70 per cent
fall in interim profits grimly testifies. Yet the exasperating aspect of
Pilkington's recent history lies in its unhappy ability to exacerbate its
plight. There is no evidence from yesterday's statement that the arrival of
Mr Roger Leverton has yet made much difference.
By strolling into the downturn with excessive borrowings, costs and
capacity, Pilkington only deepened its cyclical downswing. By cutting
capital expenditure and sacrificing the Sola spectacles business in its
desperate determination to hold the dividend, Mr Leverton is in danger of
dulling the coming upturn. Even assuming Pilkington receives Pounds 200m for
Sola, the sale is likely to be dilutive and the money will make only a small
dent in likely year-end borrowings of Pounds 800m as Pilkington continues to
bleed cash. Dealing with that problem should have required a much more
rigorous rationalisation. Instead Pilkington seems intent on decorating the
Christmas tree while the roof needs repair.
In time, the huge operational gearing of the business should mean that
profits surge when recovery arrives, although overcapacity may complicate
the sums. The benign effects of devaluation and Pilkington's severe squeeze
on working capital may yet buy the company time to save its face. However if
there is no improvement by next June, Pilkington's decision to maintain its
dividend will leave it looking pretty reckless.

FT  11 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Target practice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The currency markets were right not to look to the Bundesbank for short-term
comfort yesterday. Next year's money supply target range of 4.5 per cent to
6.5 per cent is a little more generous than this year, but with M3 growth in
the final quarter of 1992 likely to come in between 9 per cent and 10 per
cent, there is little immediate prospect of lower interest rates. The now
familiar litany of worries - the budget, wage pressures and next month's VAT
increase - also means the bank is unlikely to relent much before the end of
the first quarter.
At some stage after that, declining growth may bring the money supply into
line. Then the Bundesbank may be in a position to cut quite sharply. The
D-Mark would weaken and the pressure would be off the ERM. As before, the
problem for the system lies in getting from here to there. The task is
harder now Norway has abandoned its informal link to the Ecu. It could
become harder still if the Edinburgh summit fails to find a way of letting
Denmark off the Maastricht hook.
The European authorities must be hoping Christmas torpor will deter another
bout of speculation. Yesterday's French announcement of a money supply
target broadly in line with that of Germany signals an intention for
monetary policy to converge. That may help. So may yesterday's modest rate
cuts in Belgium and the Netherlands, not to mention Germany's fixed rate
repurchase operation which at least means money market rates will not rise
this year. But it is touch and go, and the new year may see a different

FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: Ballet was enthralling, and not misguided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with incredulity the review by Clement Crisp on The Tales of
Beatrix Potter (Arts, December 7).
I have recently watched Swan Lake in awe and been moved to tears at
Mayerling (which I saw twice). I found the production of The Dream and
Beatrix Potter simply marvellous.
Rather than viewing the 'staging as misguided and unworthy', I sat
enthralled, watching these 'animals' dance. Moreover, at the Saturday
evening performance, I noticed only a handful of children; so how Mr Crisp
concluded that 'It is . . . a ploy by Covent Garden to bring in an audience
on the tugging arms of children' I will never know.
The house was packed to bursting point (I had to queue at 9.30am on Saturday
to obtain a ticket) and the final applause tumultuous.
Perhaps Mr Crisp should have talked, as I did, to 'your average punter'; he
would have found that most people had a fantastic evening's entertainment
and hence 'the attentions of Rentokil' may be better applied to his column.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Man of the people throws down the gauntlet: President Boris
Yeltsin may be risking all in calling for a referendum on Russia's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Yeltsin is in battledress once more: his enemies are clear and his
standard raised. Once more, he stood yesterday morning before the hostile
Congress of Russian People's Deputies - as he had before the Communist party
central committee and the Soviet parliament on his road to power - and, in
his stentorian voice, laid down the lines of his defiance. In such
situations in the past, he has gambled and won. Now, however, he is putting
not just his career on the table, but his country as well.
His call yesterday for a referendum to decide whether the president or
Congress should rule Russia appears to destroy at a stroke the weeks of
negotiations and concessions to the central ground. Where he had been
careful to present himself as a president of all the people, and had seemed
to lean heavily towards the centrist Civic Union in a search for a broader
base, he has now abruptly broken with the politics of interest group
manoeuvre in favour of a direct appeal to the people.
Why did he change course? According to deputies close to Mr Yeltsin, his
advisers since the last Congress met in April have presented him with the
option of going over the heads of the obstructive Congress and its permanent
body, the Supreme Soviet. Until now, he has said that he did not want to
provoke a battle with the deputies.
When Mr Yeltsin met a group of supportive deputies on Saturday morning,
before the vote on a series of constitutional amendments which would have
sharply reduced his authority, he indicated that he was ready for such an
appeal if the package passed. In the event, the most damaging amendments
were narrowly defeated. But the vote on Wednesday which blocked Mr Yeltsin's
attempt to confirm his acting prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, as the
permanent premier seemed to have provided a substitute trigger.
Mr Yeltsin and the Congress reached their impasse for two reasons. First,
the Congress, which had opened last week, voted for a motion which roundly
condemned his economic reform programme as 'against the people's interests'
and demanded changes to economic policy far more sweeping than those Mr
Yeltsin and his government were prepared to contemplate. These included a
demand for a release of more credit to industry and an immediate end to
Russia's fall in production.
Such demands were of particular concern because of the constraints which Mr
Yeltsin's reform programme is already facing. He has been forced by the
power of the industrial lobbies and the fear of mass unemployment to extend
financial support to the ailing state enterprises. This, and his
disagreements with the central bank, have added to strong inflationary
pressures.
The second - and the more pressing - reason for the current impasse is the
constitutional mess in which the country has wallowed since the collapse of
the Soviet Union. Unusually among post-communist states, Russia has neither
a new constitution nor a newly elected assembly. Its constitution is a
patched-up version of Soviet law, and the 'parliament' preserves the
two-level Congress and Supreme Soviet. In both, deputies were elected by
popular vote in 1990. Most of the candidates were selected by the Communist
party and its various front organisations.
In this uncertain situation the powers and responsibilities of the
president, legislature, government and judicial authorities are unclear.
Indeed, much of the business of the current legislative session has been an
attempt by the Congress to gain control of the government.
Mr Yeltsin has now chosen to break this impasse. By doing so he has plunged
Russian society into a conflict which his opponents were saying yesterday
would be bloody and which will certainly lead to further political
polarisation. General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, made clear in a
tense speech to the Congress yesterday that he had broken with the
president, and in doing so was implicitly putting himself at the head of the
opposition to him. Together with his colleagues in the Civic Union, he
appealed for a compromise to which a president who has shown himself to be
most uncompromising may refuse to agree.
Having made his choice, Mr Yeltsin is faced with several urgent questions.
First, how solid is his base? His radical support is smaller than it was
when it stood for the cause of Russia against the crumbling Soviet Union.
His personal stock has fallen with the people as the economic crisis has
deepened. His government, well supported abroad, has shallow roots at home
and has only recently sought to build relationships in industry. Where
before there was no obvious alternative, now at least Gen Rutskoi is a
potential challenger. This does not mean that Mr Yeltsin is doomed to fail
or to agree to a humiliating climbdown, but the path he has chosen promises
to be the most difficult.
Second, how strong is his opposition? In the Congress, it is overwhelming.
All of his opponents among the deputies cannot be dismissed as reactionaries
or unbowed communists. Some are against him because their constituents are
suffering from the effects of reform - and they are beginning to feel
answerable to them. In the security apparatus and the army, there is a
strong tug of loyalties. Mr Victor Barannikov, the security minister,
yesterday gave a speech which included alarmist passages about the external
threat from foreign security services and the interior threat of organised
crime. In the context, it sounded like a warning from the Soviet past.
However, the opposition is also deeply divided. The centre ground, on which
Gen Rutskoi and his fellow leaders in the Civic Union are seeking to stand,
claims to be interested in reform and stability. The hardliners, clustered
around the National Salvation Front, with its patriotic and communist
sympathies, appear interested in neither. The two groupings have had talks
but failed to reach any agreements. However, figures such as Mr Nikolai
Travkin, leader of the Democratic party, could act as compromise leaders.
Finally, can reform be continued? Mr Gaidar, who Mr Yeltsin said would
remain in office, was typically businesslike yesterday, saying that talks
would continue with the international financial institutions, and that the
privatisation and other reform programmes would proceed as planned. Yet he
knows better than any other how flickering reform's flame is, and what a
gust it is now having to withstand as, once again, Russia is plunged into
crisis.
Mr Yeltsin has, therefore, significantly raised the stakes in the contest
for political power. But he has not wholly cut himself off from retreat.
Last night, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a close aide and a deputy prime minister,
was negotiating with Mr Yuri Yarov, a deputy speaker of the parliament, on
the possible grounds for compromise.
In the confrontational world of Russian politics, it is possible that Mr
Yeltsin acted as he did in order to frighten the Congress into acquiescence.
But he has vastly strained the fragile system by doing so. Resolution by
compromise would now seem to demand the humiliation of either Congress or
the president.
If neither backs down, the stage is set for a winter of political struggle
which puts economic reform, political resolution and the fate of the country
itself at hazard, once more.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Observer: Hot seat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spare a thought for poor old Andrew Buxton, the embattled chief executive of
Barclays Bank who's supposed to step into the chairman's seat at the end of
the month.
Not only are the institutions gunning for him, but now one of his former
minions, Martin Vander Weyer, is attacking him in the Spectator for
inheriting the top job because of his family connections.
Buxton is a descendant of a union between Sir Thomas Foxwell Bt and a Miss
Gurney of Norwich, and according to the article was passed over for the
chairmanship last time round because of his youth. However, it was common
gossip in the bank that Sir John Quinton was only supposed to be keeping
'the seat warm for Andrew'.
The peculiar hold of members of the bank's founding families on the the top
jobs at Barclays has often been commented on. But Vander Weyer is better
briefed than most. Until recently he worked at Barclays and his late father,
Deryk, was deputy chairman when Sir Timothy Bevan was running the show.
It is often said that Sir Deryk, who revolutionised Barclays' marketing,
would have made a better chairman than Sir Timothy Bevan, but never had a
chance because he wasn't family.
No doubt this might have coloured young Vander Weyer's thinking. Even so, if
the institutions really are intent on shaking up the Barclays' boardroom
they might question whether Sir Timothy really is earning his keep after 26
years on the board.

The royal family's sense of public duty is reaching new heights - to the
extent of giving their own blood.
A sample from the Duke of Edinburgh has enabled the Forensic Science Service
to make some progress in identifying nine skeletons unearthed in eastern
Russia last year.
The blood contained DNA which has been matched by home office experts with
minute samples from the remains, which it is thought may include those of
Tsarina Alexandria and three of her children, executed by Bolsheviks in
1918.
Russian scientists asked the FSS for help because of its DNA expertise; the
FSS duly asked Prince Philip for a blood sample. He is directly descended
from the Tsarina through his mother; his grandmother Victoria was the
Tsarina's sister.
The FSS yesterday expressed gratitude for the Duke's interest in its work.
The British royals, in their turn, may find the investigation helpful in
achieving a sense of proportion; whatever their current difficulties,
popular feeling isn't going to run as high in 1992-93 Britain as it did in
1917-18 Russia.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Observer: Landing Lee?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After 13 years at the controls of the once-ailing Chrysler car company,
could Lee Iacocca, its high-profile chairman, be preparing for one last
rescue mission?
There are rumours that the 68-year-old Iacocca has been approached by
advisers involved in the restructuring of Trans World Airlines.
If the restructuring goes through as planned next year, the airline will be
owned by its creditors and unions.
The top job, however, will become vacant because Carl Icahn, the former
corporate raider who currently holds the bulk of TWA's shares, is bowing out
as part of the deal.
So far, there has been no word on the subject from Iacocca HQ although the
great man has not, apparently, been short of job offers after he quits
Chrysler at the end of the month.
But the notion does raise some interesting possibilities. Would Iacocca  -
who starred in a series of Chrysler ads - appear on the nation's TV screens,
flogging cheap fares, for example?

FT  11 DEC 92 / Observer: The cult of Ross Goobey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Alastair Ross Goobey, 46, finally about to outshine his famous dad,
George, now 81, and former investment boss of the Imperial Tobacco Pension
Fund?
It sounds like Alistair has landed the plum job of chief executive of
Postel, the fund management operation that looks after some Pounds 20bn of
investments for the British Telecom and Post Office pension schemes, and is
probably the UK's second-largest manager of pension fund assets. The job was
vacated when Andrew Threadgold decided to go off and seek his fortune in
Australia.
Although Alastair is currently on what the City calls the sell side, as
chief investment strategist of brokers James Capel, he has had extensive
experience on the buy (or fund management) side at Courtaulds Pension Fund
and at the independent fund management boutique Geoffrey Morley and
Partners. He has also had two spells on attachment to the Treasury, most
recently as special adviser to Norman Lamont in the run-up to the last
election.
This could leave him with some divided loyalties. Lamont, after all, will
need to sell something like Pounds 50bn of government bonds to balance the
books in the next financial year.
On the other hand, Alastair Ross Goobey told a James Capel investment
seminar yesterday that equities were a better prospect than bonds. 'Buying
bonds today is a very bad bet but I am sure we will all do it,' he mused.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: EC's 'use-it-or-lose-it' air slots decision a real
breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN B HORNSBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One is certainly entitled to beware of UK ministers bearing gifts from
Brussels. However, the first hard-won step (discussed in your editorial 'Air
Waves', December 9) in regulating the allocation of take-off and landing
slots does actually amount to the breakthrough that Mr John MacGregor, UK
transport secretary, claims it to be. In emphasising that slots are
privileges that may ultimately be withdrawn in the Community interest and
are not national rights which are inviolate under the Treaty of Rome, the
Council of Ministers has brought the legal position in the air transport
sector more into line with the present Commission's policy. That is, in
relation to certain intellectual property rights and the exclusive rights of
public enterprises - rights hitherto considered untouchable unless actually
discriminatory and protectionist.
Clearly much still needs to be done; the 'use-it-or-lose-it' principle in
relation to slots falls some way short of recent more radical measures such
as effectively striking down (albeit belatedly) the UK TV listings copyright
and abolishing some exclusive rights in the telecommunications sector.
However, in taking one more step towards a free (as opposed to a common)
market, the Community has confirmed its relatively recent policy of
attacking restrictions of competition where they really originate, namely
within the member states and not the private sector.
It is to be hoped that, subsidiarity notwithstanding, the seeds that have
been planted lately under the present Commission will not fall on stony
ground in the next.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: Cadbury must not lead to creation of 'two-tier'
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DONALD B BUTCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Makinson (Letters December 4) does an ill-service to both improving
corporate governance and democratic principles with his lofty dismissal of
the role of individual shareholders. He suggests that corporate governance
should remain the responsibility of institutions and that individual
shareholders will continue to waste their time with 'conversations over tea
and a bun at the annual meeting'. Isn't he a little out of tune with the
times when we have charters galore aimed at bolstering the rights of the
individual? We might even have a shareholders' charter one day.
If corporate governance is poor and profits decline it is the individual
investor's pocket which suffers either immediately via reduced
dividends/share values or, if he chooses an institution to invest for him,
via reduced policy bonuses etc. Institutional investors' pockets, if a
meaningful concept, are subject to different forces. But institutional
shareholders also have corporate governance problems just like the companies
in which they invest. That doesn't diminish the vital role they play, it
just puts into context the important role which the individual shareholder
ought also to perform - but often doesn't. As Cadbury says 'if too many AGMs
are at present an opportunity missed, this is because shareholders (whatever
the size of their holding) do not make the most of them and, in some cases,
boards do not encourage them."
Institutional and individual shareholders both wish to invest in successful
and profitable companies. Better corporate governance should contribute to
that aim. This association believes institutional and individual
shareholders should seek ways of working together to achieve that aim and we
will be trying to bring this about in a number of ways. We need the support
of individual shareholders to do this and to respond constructively to the
Cadbury recommendations.
Cadbury has turned his face against two-tier boards and we should turn our
faces against 'two-tier' shareholders.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: The roots of an underclass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOF RAYNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial on the zig-zags of government policy on inner cities
('Urban Policy', December 7) was, for the most part, bang on target.
Overstretched, over-stressed local authorities attempting to provide some
hope to the most deprived populations are to receive less financial support.
But it isn't helpful to confuse the problem with the people. When you speak
of the underclass as a 'formidable challenge to western democracies', aren't
you forgetting that membership of this group is rather more of a challenge
for the people themselves? The much-talked-about underclass is composed of
people who have given up the search for work because there isn't any, who
are homeless because council accommodation has been sold off, and who are in
some cases denied income support because they are too young. The government
fails to recognise that the underclass has been created by conscious,
incremental acts of policy. Sadly, it may be much harder to unmake these
problems than it was to invent them.

My own business of 23 years' standing imports motor spares which are sold on

been forced to work many hours each week, harder than ever before, just to
stay in business. On top of this we now have to find extra time in order to
produce statistical records for the government - on pain of criminal
penalties. We are told to export our way out of the recession but the
paperwork requirement for exporters will ensure that I keep well under the
exporter's Intrastat limit even if it means losing business. Surely the idea
of joining the EC was to make trading easier and not to stifle it.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: A worrying analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAIN DECKERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Bijan-Daniel Khezri's analysis of the Swiss debate about European
integration (Letters, December 9) is somewhat worrying.
He asserts that 'Europe's political class and business leaders have failed
to make the . . . notion of subsidiarity and supranationality accessible to
the public . . .' Faced with this problem, a conventional liberal might opt
for a campaign of public education. According to Mr Khezri, however, this
would be to no avail since the issues at hand 'simply surpass the
comprehensive capabilities of the average masses'.
To suggest the Swiss rejected the EEA because they did not understand what
it meant is patronising. Further, to suggest that people should not be asked
for their opinion because they cannot understand what is at issue smacks of
elitism (one shudders at the thought of students of Etudes Internationales
using terms such as 'the average masses').
It is time we took democracy a little bit more seriously.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Riding the rollercoaster: Martin Wolf asks whether the EC's
Edinburgh summit can help revive the performance of Europe's ailing economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From Eurosclerosis to Europhoria and back again; this has been the history
of the European Community since the beginning of the 1980s. It has been an
exciting rollercoaster ride. But will the Edinburgh summit bring the next
rise any closer?
Good economic performance is not optional. It is the EC's lifeblood. Periods
of rapid growth, such as the 1950s, 1960s, early 1970s and late 1980s, have
also been times of advance. Growth encourages governments to take risks with
integration, and integration in turn promotes growth. It is probably no
accident that 1984 was when the British budget rebate was settled, when
thoughts turned to the Single European Act (SEA) and the programme to
complete the single market, and also when the EC economy returned to
reasonable economic growth once more.
The EC economy as a whole expanded at 2 1/2 per cent a year or more in every
year between 1984 and 1990 (see chart). During those years, the SEA was
conceived and ratified. The single-market programme was put in place. The
exchange rate mechanism became both more stable, with realignments virtually
ceasing after January 1987, and more universal. In a last burst of
Euro-enthusiasm, a treaty on economic and monetary union was conceived,
negotiated and agreed at Maastricht.
None of these achievements was particularly easy. Economic success made them
possible.
The good EC performance in the seven fat years between 1984 and 1990 was
partly a reflection of the worldwide recovery, which began in the US. The
weakness of the dollar from 1985 was also expansionary, since it induced
monetary loosening in countries whose monetary authorities tried to support
the American currency.
Improved EC performance also reflected changes specific to the EC.
Successful reduction in inflation in the first half of the 1980s (see chart)
made possible renewed growth. Meanwhile, the single-market programme was
part of a wider European process of liberalisation and structural reform. As
for the programme itself, the most important fruit may have already been
picked. The rapid expansion of EC business investment that occurred during
the second half of the 1980s was partly in anticipation of the completion of
the single market.
Yet European economic performance was not an unalloyed success. Aggregate
economic growth was reasonably satisfactory for a rich region with low
population growth. But many worried about the failure of the EC to take a
leading place on the technological frontier in industries like computer
manufacture and consumer electronics. Whether they are right to worry, only
time can tell.
One problem did become more obvious. Eurosclerosis - the market rigidities
thought to be inhibiting EC growth - may have been exaggerated, but the
sclerosis of the EC labour market was not (see chart). The EC-wide
unemployment rate last peaked at just under 11 per cent in 1986, only a
little above the US peak. But US unemployment fell to 5.3 per cent in 1989
and total US employment grew by 18 per cent between 1979 and 1991. By
contrast, EC unemployment only fell to 8.4 per cent in 1990 before rising to
9.8 per cent in October, while total EC employment grew only 7 per cent
between 1979 and 19991.
With this important exception, the EC economy still looked healthy a couple
of years ago. This is no longer the case. The EC economy is struggling, not
least Germany's, despite what should have been the great opportunity
provided by German unification and despite the absence in most of
continental Europe of the overhang of private-sector debt that has depressed
the Anglo-Saxon economies, as well as Scandinavia and Japan.
What has gone wrong?
First of all, the EC's problems must not be exaggerated. Economic slowdowns
are inevitable. This said, some explanations are required, especially when
the recessions of 1973-76 and 1979-83 had the specific proximate causes of
the oil price shocks. Fatalistic appeal to very long term, Kondratieff,
cycles is not persuasive.
In the second place, there was a significant deterioration in the
international environment. Under George Bush, the US had its poorest
performance since President Hoover, with identical results for the hapless
incumbent. The debt deflation that weakened the US economy has also
undermined the performance of other economies. Combined, they account for
two-thirds of OECD economic output.
Yet even the external environment is not a sufficient explanation for
worsening EC performance. The EC's gross domestic product of Dollars 6.2
trillion (million million) in 1991 was even greater than that of the US,
while its ratio of external merchandise exports to GDP was only 8.4 per
cent. The EC ought to be able to grow under its own steam. It certainly
should be able to do so as well as the open developing countries of east
Asia, which are doing just that.
Third and most important have been internal economic developments. The UK is
the debt-deflating cuckoo in the EC nest. Meanwhile, in Italy, public-sector
excess has made up for private sector prudence. It is no accident that these
two countries, which account for a third of EC GDP, are in severe economic
difficulties and have seen their currencies forced out of the ERM.
Yet what has happened to the UK and Italy has not been the EC's most
important internal development. That honour must be accorded to German
unification, an event that is remaking both the country at the heart of
Europe and Europe itself. Unfortunately, German unification has been met by
a number of serious mistakes that share a common feature: the attempt to
subordinate economic forces to political dictation.
The first set of errors was made in Germany itself: the commitment to
one-for-one monetary conversion and the acceptance of premature wage
convergence. These mistakes were compounded by others: failure to understand
the implications of east-west wage convergence for all-German real wages;
and the decision to borrow to cover most of the initial costs of the
transfers to east Germany, which are some 7 per cent of west German GDP.
These decisions led to open conflict between the government, on the one
hand, and a battered Bundesbank, on the other.
The second set of errors occurred in the EC as a whole. A real appreciation
of the D-Mark was required to facilitate absorption of resources within the
German economy. A D-Mark realignment or, better still, temporary flotation
of the D-Mark would have been a superior method of bringing about the needed
adjustment than the deflation throughout the EC, via high real interest
rates, that has actually occurred.
European policymakers decided to harden the ERM, despite German unification,
while doing nothing to make the system able to bear the strain. The results
of this mistake have been seen this autumn. The pound and the lira have been
forced out; the peseta and the escudo have had to realign; and the Irish
punt, the Danish krone and the French franc have come under pressure.
If these are the problems, what are the solutions?
The urgency of the cyclical problem must not be exaggerated. The Bundesbank
is almost certain to lower short-term interest rates over the next 12
months. It may even do so quite sharply. The US economy is recovering as
well. By 1995 the EC economy is likely to look far healthier than it does
now. These prospects should themselves ease market pressure, particularly
via further weakening of the D-Mark, which is needed to improve long-term
German competitiveness and improve its rapidly deteriorating cyclical
position.
Little can be expected of the EC's growth package. The Commission argues
that symbolic action is needed to boost confidence. Greater confidence is,
indeed, required. But economies are not in poor shape because confidence is
poor. Confidence is poor because economies are in poor shape. Furthermore,
the case for more EC infrastructure spending, sound enough in itself, should
not be linked to the EC's cyclical problems, since cyclically motivated
infrastructure spending is almost always mistimed.
Something more substantial, such as the stimulus of 1 per cent of EC GDP
proposed by the Commission, will not happen, not least because Germany,
which bears deep scars from when it agreed to be a 'locomotive' in the late
1970s, is opposed. The budgetary difficulties of Italy, the UK, Germany and
Spain (which together account for more than two-thirds of EC GDP) also
suggest that a substantial co-ordinated fiscal stimulus would be unwise. It
might even be counterproductive, though such a stimulus could perhaps make
sense for France.
This does not mean that the EC is doomed to sit and twiddle its thumbs.
The first priority for the EC is monetary easing. Under present
arrangements, a member state can enjoy that only by leaving the ERM
altogether or by waiting for the Bundesbank to move. Belabouring the
Bundesbank is counterproductive. Changing ERM arrangements is not. The ERM
without exchange controls has proved itself half-baked, especially subjected
to the stresses of German unification and the inability of the German
government to make its policies more communautaire.
If there is to be economic and monetary union, those who make the grade
should start as soon as possible. Waiting around for years - at least four,
according to the Maastricht treaty, and probably more - will ensure more
accidents. Alternatively - or at the same time, but for different countries
 -the ERM should be made more flexible. UK short-term interest rates are now
below German ones because the pound is expected to appreciate. With
temporarily wider margins, perhaps for just the next year or so, other
countries could enjoy the same luxury.
The second and more intractable policy issue is the EC labour market. It
will be impossible to sustain a stable ERM, let alone Emu, if the
performance of labour markets continues to deteriorate. The problem did not
go away in the fat years. It has returned to haunt the lean ones. It must be
a principal focus of policymakers' attention.
These are not the questions that will keep the EC policymakers up over the
weekend. But the implication of their limited agenda are also clear. Their
deliberations may determine where the EC goes politically. They will
contribute little, directly, to its prosperity.

FT  11 DEC 92 / The fairytale crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every so often Britain reveals itself as the land of no logic, nil reason
and nonsense. It is in a flap this week about the constitutional
implications of the decision by the Prince and Princess of Wales to lead
separate lives. Even by English standards this is woolly.
While there is a monarchy there are no constitutional implications arising
from the matrimonial difficulties of the royal family. Someone will succeed
Queen Elizabeth. If it is not Prince Charles, it will be Prince William; if
not the latter, then the next in line. Whoever it is will presumably have
been trained to fulfil the contemporary functions of the office, which are
fourfold. The monarch must support good causes. She or he must create an
atmosphere in which courtiers and the recipients or purchasers of honours
may flatter themselves. The institution must at best enchant and at worst
entertain the populace. Finally, politicians delude themselves that, under
the Crown, they are working within a rational framework.
In theory there should be no questioning of who is to occupy such a
hereditary post. In practice the abdication of 1937 diluted the hereditary
principle. The government sat as a secret court of morals over the monarch
and cast him out. We therefore endure an English muddle. Lineal descent
determines the heir, but his or her personal behaviour must be vetted. The
test changes with time; if, as is to be hoped, the Queen continues in good
health for another decade or more, the fitness of her eldest son to replace
her will be determined by whatever is the prevailing popular opinion in the
early decades of the next century. Constitutional lore will be altered to
suit the moment.
That's it. Once through the hoop, the occupant of the throne serves as a
symbol of continuity and unity, a genuinely useful purpose. In short, the
debate about whether the Princess can be Queen if she is leading a life
separate from her husband is actually about private matters and individual
careers.
There are plenty of real constitutional issues to be discussed, but it is
not the English way to take notice of these. Just two weeks ago Lord Chief
Justice Taylor called for the incorporation of the European Convention on
Human Rights into British law.
'Our ratification of the convention obliges us in the end to accept it,'
said Lord Taylor, 'but our refusal to incorporate means acceptance occurs
only after a decision in Strasbourg, much delay and humiliation.'
Lord Justice Bingham, Master of the Rolls, is of the same mind. You could
hardly imagine two more distinguished advocates of what most proponents of
constitutional reform have long supported. Yet the response of Lord Mackay,
the Lord Chancellor, was a politicians' brush-off. The rest is silence.
This echoes the uncanny stillness that has descended on all genuine
constitutional debate since April 9. On that day the Conservatives were
returned to office for the fourth time in a row. Not surprisingly, they are
great admirers of our constitution. Under it, the Tory party always wins.
For the time being their organised complacency has vanquished even Scottish
nationalism. The party of that name is quiescent. Labour's shadow Scottish
secretary, Mr Tom Clarke, is on sick leave. The Liberal Democrats are
focusing on Bosnia. The stage is thus set for the highly centralised British
government to trumpet its allegiance to subsidiarity in Edinburgh today
without a blush. If anyone was so rude as to ask why the Celts should not
have self-government, the Scottish secretary, Mr Ian Lang, would be ready to
reply. Mr Lang, whose sometimes downbeat public image belies his innate
political verve, would doubtless respond that the Conservatives are
devolving power directly to the people, through opted-out schools, hospitals
and the like. Yes, but the stuffing is being knocked out of that one by the
Treasury's already evident determination to take back the initial bribe
money given to hospital trusts, GP fundholders and grant maintained schools.
That leaves Mr Lang with two further arguments against Scottish devolution.
The first is that it should not come about in order to satisfy European
Community needs; the second that strengthening regions weakens nation-states
which in turn strengthens Brussels. Thinking of this kind sets the seal on
the 'stock-taking' about Scotland promised by John Major before the
election. It is a useful little phrase: 'stock-taking' helps Mr Lang win
arguments, fiscal or otherwise, on his fiefdom's behalf. It won the summit
conference for Edinburgh, on the ground that the Scots must be made to feel
that notice is being taken of them. It may achieve modifications of local
government and parliamentary committee structures.
What it will not change is the constitution. Only a proper crisis would do
that. Nothing that has happened since April 9, including this week's
dramatic end to a fairytale, constitutes such a cataclysm.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Leading Article: The Edinburgh agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SELDOM CAN the mismatch between the challenges facing the European Community
and its capacity to act on them have been as glaring as at today's Edinburgh
summit. Yet seldom has there been a greater need for EC leaders to cut
through the tangle of detail surrounding them. Only if they settle their
immediate disagreements - problems that can either be solved fairly easily
or cannot be avoided any longer - will they be able next year to focus on
what is really important.
The list of issues which Mr John Major and his colleagues have left off the
Edinburgh agenda is striking. They are unlikely to be in a position to
launch a 'growth package' that would make more than a symbolic difference.
They will not attempt to reform the European Monetary System. They will
leave the Gatt deal on one side. They will not discuss Mr Jacques Attali's
far-sighted proposal for a pan-European free trade area. There is just a
chance they will summon up the courage to override Greek objections to the
recognition of Macedonia, but they will not discuss any action in Bosnia on
the scale needed to halt the explosion of Europe's worst refugee crisis
since the 1940s. And they will respond to German pleas for a sharing of this
burden only by endorsing plans already agreed among their interior
ministers, under which most refugees will be returned to the first 'safe'
country they reached - usually one already overwhelmed by numbers and
lacking either resources or institutions to handle them.
Stop short
By contrast they will hail the achievement of the single market on January
1, though without agreeing on the abolition of frontier checks on the
movement of people. They will issue a declaration on subsidiarity and
transparency, probably deleting a few directives from the statute book to
show they are in earnest, but will stop short of opening the EC's
legislature (the Council of Ministers) to public scrutiny. They will agree
on an all-round increase in the numbers of the European Parliament, and will
no doubt stitch up a horsetrader's bargain on the siting of new EC
institutions.
They may even agree to start negotiations with those Efta countries still
seeking full membership, since Chancellor Helmut Kohl has apparently
persuaded President Francois Mitterrand to waive his insistence that
Maastricht must first be ratified by all 12 existing members. But that
agreement depends on resolution of one of the two issues that do have to be
settled at this summit, namely the EC's spending ceilings for the next seven
years. Spain will block enlargement until it is satisfied on that issue, and
so far it is not satisfied with the offers made by the main net contributor
countries, Britain and Germany; while Britain is at odds with other net
contributors over its own rebate.
Diabolical ingenuity
On that point Mr Major will probably get his way, weak though his case seems
to most of his partners, because any diminution of the rebate would put paid
to his hopes of getting Maastricht through the House of Commons. On the rest
of the budget there will be an unseemly wrangle, but it should not be an
insoluble one.
The other issue that simply cannot be ducked is the 'Danish problem'. Here
British and EC lawyers have been performing feats of diabolical ingenuity to
devise a 'legally binding' formula which is supposed to let the Danes ratify
the treaty while being exempted from most of its provisions, and yet not
require re-ratification by everyone else. The danger of such a formula is
that others - possibly Britain, probably some of the would-be new members -
will seek to invoke the Danish precedent, although one can argue that all
Denmark is doing is to invoke the precedent already set by British opt-outs
negotiated a year ago.
In any case, that risk can no longer be avoided if the treaty in its present
form is to be saved at all. The best hope is that the formula will be
accepted by all, and that both Britain and Denmark will then move as fast as
possible to a decision by their respective constitutional procedures, not
prolonging the agony with a ridiculous game of Gaston and Alphonse. Europe
can live with the treaty or if necessary without. What it cannot afford is
to spend another year haggling over the small print.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Economics and energy prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE UNDER the illusion that the furore over the future of the British
coal is capable of simple resolution would do well to read the report
published yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild, director general of
the Office of Electricity Regulation.
Its complex tabulations and reasoning about the wisdom of the electricity
industry's so-called 'dash for gas' serve to illustrate how difficult it is
to be confident about judgments which by definition involve guesswork about
the likely course of fuel prices over very long periods.
Prof Littlechild's view is that in signing up for substantial quantities of
gas-fired electric power, Britain's regional electricity companies did the
right thing. He argues that the price they will pay for their gas is lower
than the price they could have obtained in seeking more coal-fired capacity
via the two big national generators, National Power and PowerGen. Prof
Littlechild is also sympathetic to the argument of the regional companies
that, faced with the National Power-PowerGen duopoly, it is in their
interest to open up additional sources of generation.
Offer's calculations were instantly challenged yesterday by National Power
and others, but those who lack the specialist knowledge to do their own
arithmetic are likely to conclude that Offer's figures are the least
partisan and most trustworthy available. Offer's critics maintain that the
regulator also has a vested interest in diversifying ownership in electric
power generation and hence in backing the dash for gas.
Indispensable tool
The immediate point for the government, as it approaches the end of its
review of the October decision to close 31 coal mines, is that it should now
discount the gas issue in its reassessment of coal's future. Unless
government can be satisfied that Prof Littlechild has got his numbers wrong,
the option of mothballing or delaying completion of gas-fired capacity is
out.
The underlying point is that, whatever the difficulties, economic analysis
of the kind published yesterday by Prof Littlechild is an indispensable tool
of energy policymaking. It is one of the more disgraceful aspects of British
energy policy over the years that it has seldom, if ever, been based upon
rigorous work of this sort.
Uncompetitive prices
Instead, politicians have preferred to lurch from project to project,
arguing pointlessly about whether energy policy needs to exist at all (yes,
says the Labour party; no, said the Thatcherites.) The danger with the first
view is that it quickly turns into a command economy, with politicians
responding to short-term pressures and making bad decisions which result in
uncompetitive energy prices. This was British energy policy from 1945 to
1979. The legacy of the latter (British energy policy 1979-1992) is a series
of major decisions on privatisation, new pits and power station projects
taken without any attempt to understand and allow for the economic links
between them. In energy, a decision about electricity is also inescapably a
decision about coal, nuclear, gas and oil.
If Britain is to retain, as it must in the interests of a competitive
economy, its momentum towards regulated markets in energy, it is essential
that transparent data about prices are available both to the market, the
regulator and to the politicians who will still be required to take some
decisions, whether for social, environmental or security reasons.
It may well be that in response to the rebellion on its back benches the
government will decide that it wishes to maintain or even increase the level
of subsidy to the coal industry in order to save miners' jobs. If so,
ministers should ensure that at the very least the price of this transaction
is visible: either as direct subsidy from general taxation or a quantified
levy on electricity consumers. There will be powerful instincts to the
contrary. Transparent subsidies attract the attention of the European
Commission, and electricity consumers have proved to be obligingly supine in
accepting the existing toll to pay for uneconomic nuclear power. But when it
comes to energy policy, the oldest advice is the best: let there be light.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: Black comedy in 'Grace' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's an honour to meet you,' says the Rev Neal Hoffmann, a prosperous
American evangelist, to Ruth Hartstone, an impoverished Englishwoman who is
about to sell him her family estate. Welcoming him with stately courtesy,
she simply says 'Yes.'
The battlelines are already drawn; but what is the battle? Ruth cannot
afford to stay in the family home, and is selling up for two million.
Hoffman and his Enterprise Faith team, by contrast, are not only ruthlessly
evangelical and American, they are also relentlessly profit-oriented and
Philistine. They want to buy the Hartstone home because a miracle happened
there 40 years ago, at the deathbed of Ruth's sister Grace. Hoffman now
plans to base his Enterprise Faith there and there to film his account of
Grace's story.
A black comedy ensues, along Evelyn Waugh or Angus Wilson lines. The Hoffman
crew is a ludicrous lot, including Joanna, a Sloane actress who pursues
Ruth's young companion, Freddy, with hopes that he is the gamekeeper for
her: 'Very DH Lawrence]' She is, however, being secretly bonked by Hoffman's
English agent Gavin Driver. Hoffman's wife, a soul in torment for many
reasons, has renounced her genuine literary talent to write wretched scripts
for Enterprise Faith. Meanwhile, there is also a skeleton in the Hartstone
family cupboard. But will Ruth reveal it?
The playwright is Doug Lucie, who has written other 'darkly funny' plays.
The comedy here is acute, and so is some of the characterisation  - notably
Mrs Hoffmann. But Lucie weighs the moral scales against the Americans to
preposterous extremes. They and their Americanophile colleagues take
evangelism, Philistinism, Republicanism, Thatcherism and charlatanism to
extremes. They also demonstrate, in passing, gross male chauvinism and
anti-liberalism, plus subtle fattism and racism. Ruth and Freddy, however,
combine their religious scepticism with charity, industry, socialism and
(eventually) honesty. The contrast between the two sides is too drastic to
be either persuasive or fun.
The play was also surely written about three years ago. Though it is
officially 1992, no-one refers to a recession. Ruth and Freddy do voice an
interesting kind of despair about Britain, but this is simply old-school
pessimism (viz. E. Waugh and A. Wilson, passim).
Line by line the play is so entertaining, and so well delivered, that it
enthrals you while you watch. What weaknesses it has grow on you gradually,
and hit you afterwards. This is not the fault of Mike Bradwell's sure
direction; nor of Sue Plummer's elegant designs; nor of the cast.
The most interesting characters are subsidiary - Mrs Hoffman, Joanna, Freddy
 -and, excellently though they are played by Kate Fahy, Emma Lewis and Ben
Thomas, they are not fully developed. Kristin Thomas, in her professional
debut, is awesomely perfect as the born-again gospel-singing actress
Felicia. James Laurenson, virtually unrecognisable, does good work (apart
from a few intrusive British syllables) as Hoffman, but the role is
something of a stereotype. Likewise Anna Massey is an ideal Ruth - cynical,
genteel, precise, dowdy - but the part does not return the compliment. It is
not subtle enough to stretch her.
At the Hampstead Theatre until January 2

FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: Cotman's genius brought into the light - Susan Moore
reviews 'Cotmania and Mr Kitson' in Leeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the fate of the watercolourist to be consigned to art history's bottom
drawer. If John Sell Cotman's chosen medium had been oil paint, he would be
celebrated as one of the greatest and most original of British landscape
painters. Instead, the vulnerability of watercolour to light has ensured
that his work is secreted away in the darkness of museum print rooms, well
out of the public eye.
A rare opportunity to see something of his genius is offered by Leeds City
Art Gallery. To mark the 150th anniversary of his death, the gallery is
bringing to light a representative selection of some 40 watercolours and
sketches drawn largely from its own rich holdings.
Sydney Decimus Kitson (1871-1937), a Leeds-born architect, Cotman biographer
and passionate collector, instructed that the bulk of his immense collection
of over 1,000 watercolours, sketches and prints by and after Cotman, books,
catalogues and articles relating to the artist and 12 commonplace books of
'Cotmania', should rest in his native city. Cotmania &amp; Mr Kitson is as much
a tribute to this great champion of Cotman as to the artist himself.
Appropriately, Cotman produced some of his most outstanding and innovative
work in Yorkshire. His Yorkshire haven was at Brandsby with the Cholmeley
family. Brandsby was the scene of the happiest hours in what proved to be a
life plagued by ill-health, depression and disappointment. It had been the
young Harriet Cholmeley who coined the term 'Cotmania' in a poem of 1803,
sent to 'dear Cotty'.
'Near Brandsby' offers a taste of what is to come. The subject of the sketch
is straightforward enough: a clump of slender trees beside a field gate.
What is daring is Cotman's bold simplification of form, and a palette
restricted to a close tonal harmony of grey, olive-green and buff with
foliage and shrubs translated into blocks of flat, muted colour. The
interplay of dark tones silhouetted against light brings depth and life to
the landscape.
The same earth colours and compositional devices are found in the panorama
of Barnard Castle from Towler Hill, and Bignall Banks on the Greta. Leeds
has the pencil sketch as well as the watercolour of the latter, and the two
sheets reveal Cotman's relative faithfulness to 'that fickle Dame' Nature.
For the finished watercolour the artist has reduced the detail and
heightened the drama - adding the three birds flying across the dark foliage
of what has become a ravine in the foreground, and emphasising the
angularity of the clouds and streaming sunlight.
Moving out of the first decade of the 19th century and on to studies of
Norfolk and Normandy, one laments Cotman's decision to pursue antiquarian
and topographical publishing projects, and to expand his teaching practice,
at the expense of his art. There is nothing here to compare with the great
Greta, Duncombe Park and Brandsby watercolours, although the monochrome
studies of Blakeney and the bold geometries of the Domfront crags are
undeniably impressive.
The Greta watercolours had not been well received at the 1806 Royal Academy,
and few were sold during his lifetime. Cotman was to die in penury and close
to despair, his work having made little or no impact on his contemporaries.
As Kitson bleakly commented, there was so little demand for Cotman's
watercolours that no one bothered faking them.
Nearby Temple Newsam House presents its fourth exhibition devoted to
neglected aspects of historic interiors. 'Country House Lighting 1660-1890'
and its accompanying catalogue offer a fascinating blend of social and
design history in a stately progress through every kind of fitting - whether
for candles, oil, gas or electricity, grand or humble - evolved in man's
quest for effective artificial light. Until January 10, and at Brighton Art
Gallery, January 30-March 14.
'Cotmania &amp; Mr Kitson', sponsored by Watmoughs (Holdings) and Christie's,
continues at Leeds City Art Gallery until February 24

Television, we are told, is an ephemeral thing. My predecessor on the FT
even called his book of collected television criticism 'The Ephemeral Art'.
Yet at 7.30 tonight you can see the latest episode of Coronation Street, the
series which gets the biggest single audience in Britain, currently more
than 19m, and which started 32 years ago this week. How un-ephemeral can you
get? At 7.40 comes another edition of What The Papers Say, running since
1956. Later you will find the British movie Children Of The Damned enjoying
its umpteenth screening. An SF frightener adapted from John Wyndham's book,
it was made 28 years ago (12.10 C4). It is followed by an episode from The
Twilight Zone which was made in the US between 1959 and 1964. Also this
evening you can watch such long established television personalities as
David Frost in the embarrassing 'game' Through The Keyhole, John Cleese
presenting Prisoners Of Conscience, Esther Rantzen with the syrupy Hearts Of
Gold, and Terry Wogan with his Friday Night. If this lot are ephemeral,
heaven preserve us from the implacably entrenched.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: Richard III travels south - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A coachload of peasants and upstarts has arrived from Yorkshire and taken
over the Riverside Studios for a production of Richard III. They wear clogs,
pronounce 'you' as 'yer' and 'lover' as 'luvver'. The men are clothed in a
strange collection of evening dress and garish drape jackets. The women
resemble a mixture of tarts and char ladies.
But do not be deceived. Off-stage, they probably speak the Queen's English
and are not nearly as averse to the south as they pretend. Their Richard III
is among the most pulsating you are likely to see.
There are not many subtleties in it, but that may be because there are not
many subtleties in Richard III. Instead there is a rattling good story
briskly told. Barrie Rutter's Richard makes no plea for sympathy and no
pretensions to hidden depths. He comes across as an out-and-out villain
played by a northern stand-up comic who nevertheless has the capacity to
charm, especially the ladies. His main trait, apart from his physical
deformity, is the enthusiasm with which the villainy is pursued. At the end
he is beaten to death with staves by practically the entire cast. He
receives the blows without a whimper.
Rutter is the director as well as the king. He is also the founder of
Northern Broadsides, established in Bradford in 1990 to give more northern
bite to the British theatre. Richard III was a sell-out at this year's Hull
Festival.
The bite is there in abundance; so, remarkably, is the pace. Here is
Shakespeare with a strong dash of Fred Trueman. The clogs come into their
own in the final stages when the rival armies perform a clog dance in the
build-up to the battle. It is like the natives beating the tom-toms; the
excitement is palpable.
Riverside is an exceptionally good place for Rutter's style. The large stage
is even broader than it is deep. The back is a bare brick wall. There are no
southern sophistications like playing around with the lighting and there are
virtually no props.
Rutter adds novelties of his own. The two young princes, for example, do not
look particularly young, despite their short trousers and school caps. This
avoids conventional sweetness and pathos (though it does not entirely fit
with the text in the description of their murder).
Richard's deformity is confined to an almost permanently immobile left arm
with the hand in the trouser pocket and a slightly twisted left leg. He
wears a clog on his left foot and an ordinary shoe on his right. Yet when on
of his nephews suddenly jumps on his shoulders for a piggy-back, there is a
huge cry of pain. There has been a hint of this moments before when Richard
senses that a piggy-back is what the boy wants. These are almost his only
visible feelings in the play: they are the more striking for being physical
rather than emotional.
Why women succumb so easily and quickly to this monster who they know has
killed their nearest and dearest is a question only Shakespeare could
answer. Rutter does not have to try. He just gets on with the show at a
cracking pace. Then, when Richard is dead, there is a silence of about two
minutes in which the men slowly take off their clogs before the final lines
are spoken. This is one of the surprises of this production for these
Yorkshiremen are nothing if not professional; many of them are graduates of
the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre who have returned to
their home county. It is a pleasure to have them back in London, however
briefly. They run until January 9.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: New Torke double-act - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commissioned by the London Sinfonietta with South Bank Centre funds, Michael
Torke's Monday and Tuesday had its premiere on Tuesday at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall. In fact it is two pieces, but built upon a single
ground-plan.
The title is meant to invoke the mundane similarity of one day to the next,
with their local differences. Both pieces are in D, more or less, and more
or less in motorised 4/4 time (with many sideslips), and the material is put
through the same patterns of rotation and fragmenting. But the basic chordal
stuff of the music is slightly different - 'Tuesday' is distinctly more
chromatic, which lends it darker shadows and extra sonorous depths; so the
matched pair strikes intriguing sparks.
The usual Torke fingerprints are all there, but in particularly high relief.
The incessant, frenetic syncopations are more ingenious than ever, the
arching tunes which grow upon the chord-sequences more evasively appealing.
The pressure is regularly lightened by little carolling duets and such for
the winds. An incisive piano (Torke's own instrument) serves as monitor;
vibraphones at either side of the platform mostly lend support and emphasis,
like the under-favoured string quintet.
For some people it will be thoroughly rebarbative, but I found Monday and
Tuesday exhilarating, clever and funny, like all the best Torke. Lothar
Zagrosek conducted it with the same attentive precision he bestowed on every
work in a superlative Sinfonietta programme, disparate though they were.
Lutoslawski's Chain 1, written for the band, sounded tauter than ever, and
still wittier; Ferneyhough's Carceri d'Invenzione I rather more opaque and
surly.
In Hans Abrahamsen's Marchenbilder, six linked 'fairy-tale pictures',
Zagrosek exposed some powerful dramatic shudders that have not been so plain
before. Birtwistle's Silbury Air is rock-like, unbudgeable, and remains
forbiddingly impressive. Among the band's inspired roster of commissioned
pieces, these are treasures.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: Gissing's 'Odd Women' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A nostalgic batch of old Remington typewriters appear as part of the setting
at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, for Michael Meyer's adaptation of George
Gissing's feminist novel The Odd Women.
At least one sturdy machine is still in good working-order as we see when
Sorcha Cusack, playing Mary Barfoot, bashes out a letter on it. Mary and her
colleague Rhoda Nunn (Lorraine Ashbourne) run an establishment where young
women are taught how to type. These are 'the odd women' of the title - women
who have failed to find husbands to keep them. Barfoot and Nunn aim to give
their pupils a better deal in the harsh economic climate of Victorian London
than to become nursemaids or shop-assistants - or just wither away as
invalids and/or alcoholics among the genteel poor.
It was a remarkably prescient book when it first appeared in 1893, and in
spite of its period flavour still seems topical. It would be hard to think
of anyone better qualified than Michael Meyer, the translator of Ibsen, to
bring it to the stage. Gissing had indeed read Ibsen in German and much
admired him, sharing his view of the plight of many contemporary women but
not, alas, his sense of dramatic economy. Meyer has to be content with a
loose episodic narrative broken up into short scenes, with the stage-crew
working over-time hauling sofas and sideboards on and off.
But once this gradual build-up is accepted, the piece - in Braham Murray's
production in the round - has considerable fascination. We observe one of
the budding stenographers, Monica Madden (Lucy Scott), settle instead for
the domestic life in the shape of marriage to an exceptionally dreary
middle-aged man, Edmund Widdowson (Sean Arnold) whose only virtue is his
bank balance, more than enough to keep her in the style to which she has
hitherto been unaccustomed.
As soon as they are married he reveals a nasty possessiveness precipitating
her into an affair with an artist she meets at the Royal Academy Summer
exhibition. The pace now quickens as Widdowson rejects his erring wife.
Meanwhile her lover's friend Everard Barfoot (Paul Higgins) becomes
enamoured of Rhoda Nunn, the dedicated female emancipator and typing
instructress. Will his well-born masculine confidence and virility succeed
in shattering her idealistic defences? The conflict anticipates the dramas
of Shaw.
Lorriane Ashbourne has too simplistically negative a view of her complex
role for these scenes to work with maximum effectiveness. Lucy Scott is more
successful in developing Monica's potential and there is good work by Susan
Tordoff and Tilly Tremayne as her spinster sisters. The whole production
should gain the Gissing cult some more converts. As a brilliant classics
scholar of Owens College (Manchester University) Gissing was expelled, part
of the over-harsh punishment for a theft of which he was convicted. This
production helps to make amends.
At the Royal Exchange Manchester until December 12

FT  11 DEC 92 / Property: Creative collapse - How numbers can mislead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the search for scapegoats for the property slump, accountants are among
the prime suspects. Creative accountancy allegedly contributed to the
sector's collapse which, to add insult to injury, is now generating
substantial fees for accountants' receivership practices.
This argument should not be taken too far. It was, after all, the banks  -
which base their lending decisions on far more than published accounts -
which financed the sector's reckless expansion in the late 1980s. And the
misinterpretation of accounts often reflects as badly on their readers as on
their creators.
Nonetheless, the use of creative - though entirely legal - accounting
techniques often confused investors. Moreover, this creative approach helped
delude companies about their true exposure to a possible downturn and
encouraged them to take greater risks. Property group Rosehaugh was one of
the most commonly associated with off-balance-sheet finance - the removal of
assets and liabilities from the balance-sheet to reduce the ostensible
gearing; Rosehaugh went into administration last week.
Another recent example of how numbers can mislead was provided by Trafalgar
House, the property-to-shipping conglomerate. Trafalgar House had to restate
its 1990-91 pre-tax profits of Pounds 122.4m as a loss of Pounds 38.5m. This
followed a ruling by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounting
watchdog, that property write-downs should be taken through the profit and
loss account rather than reserves.
While the sector has largely faced up to the slump in values of the past
three years, there is still much concern among investors about non-property
companies with heavy property exposures which have not yet reflected the
full fall in values in their assets. When County NatWest, the investment
house, conducted a survey of these companies last summer, it concluded that
many had 'yet to face up to reality'.
The recurring themes of the accounting treatment of property are
off-balance-sheet finance and changes in the treatment of assets and
capitalised interest (whereby interest payments on a development are
classified as an asset on the balance-sheet, rather than an expense in the
profit and loss account).
The significance of capitalised interest came to light with the emergence of
the star developers of the 1980s, many of which have since collapsed, such
as Broadwell Land, Rockfort, Citygrove and Rush &amp; Tompkins.
These companies' apparently robust profits appear less impressive when the
capitalised interest is brought back into the profit and loss account,
revealing the company's poor ability to service its debt.
Rosehaugh provides another illustration of the ambiguity of reported
profits. In its accounts for 1989-90, Rosehaugh included Pounds 23.5m of
interest 'receivable' from its associates. In fact, much of the interest was
not received in cash and was later waived.
The problems of interpreting figures that involve capitalised interest pale
beside the difficulties created by off-balance-sheet finance. Indeed,
capitalisation of interest only becomes a real problem for readers of
accounts when its extent is obscured within an off-balance-sheet subsidiary.
Rosehaugh's extensive use of off-balance-sheet finance gave it a reputation
for obfuscation. 'However hard one pores over yesterday's results, there are
few financial things an outsider can say with relative confidence about
Rosehaugh,' was the view of the FT's Lex column in 1989 - just months before
Rosehaugh shocked the City by announcing a rescue rights issue.
But off-balance-sheet finance was very attractive because it allowed
relatively small companies to undertake ambitious ventures. In 1990 quoted
companies ran up an estimated Pounds 7.1bn in off-balance-sheet debt,
according to Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors.
The justification for excluding this debt from a company's gearing figure
was that interest is usually rolled up and only paid when the a property is
completed and sold. Moreover, the off-balance-sheet debt was assumed to be
'non-recourse', in other words that the parent company took no
responsibility for the loan if it turned bad.
But both these justifications wore thin with the property slump in the
late-1980s. As values tumbled, off-balance-sheet subsidiaries became
increasingly unable to repay their debts. And many parent companies found
they could not avoid the responsibility of 'non-recourse' loans.
Rush &amp; Tompkins is perhaps the best example of a company that disguised
problems arising from off-balance-sheet finance. The company's last set of
accounts merely listed its bank borrowings as Pounds 25m and mentioned
Pounds 89m of 'non-recourse' or limited recourse banking arrangements. When
Rush &amp; Tompkins went into receivership in May 1990 it had debts of more than
Pounds 300m.
The frequent absence of annual valuations or when assets are valued by
directors rather than independent valuers is another problem arising from
the treatment of property in accounts. This has been a particular concern in
the building sector, where hundreds of millions of pounds has been wiped off
the value of land over the past three years. Developers 'are just scratching
the surface of their problems,' said County NatWest.
New accounting standards that will be introduced early next year will
tighten up the treatment of property in accounts. But to many investors,
this is too little, too late.

<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Harding, the former chairman of British Nuclear Fuels and
long-time Hanson director, continues to add to his impressive display of
non-executive directorships. Only a week after joining the board of the
General Electric Company, he has been made a non-executive director of Legal
&amp; General.
Sir Christopher, who resigned from BNFL in June, is one of two new L&amp;G
non-executive directors. The other, Honor Chapman (below), is a partner in
Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyors, and governor of the Centre for
Economic Policy Research.
Not surprisingly for a big institutional investor active in the corporate
governance debate, L&amp;G no longer resorts to the old boy network to fill its
boardroom. It hired headhunters Woodhead Mann to draw up a list of suitable
candidates and then they were vetted by a selection committee of L&amp;G's
non-executive directors.
The insurer says that the choice of an industrialist and a property expert
was intended to maintain the balance on the board ahead of the retirement of
other non-execs. Chapman, who began her career in the London County Council
valuation department, is chairman of Jones Lang Wootton Consulting and
Research and has been in the property business for over 25 years. Sir
Christopher Harding, who made his name managing Lord Hanson's family
transport business, is a director of Slough Estates, Newarthill, English
China Clays, and ProShare (UK) as well as Hanson and GEC.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Technology: I'll pay by hologram - Cheque security has
entered a new dimension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just a few years ago, holograms were cheap and glitzy, a promotional gimmick
on a cornflakes packet or decoration on a toy.
But today, holograms - known to the initiated as optically variable devices
(OVDs) - are proving increasingly popular as a means of preventing theft and
fraud.
Already widespread on rigid plastic credit cards, the Association for
Payment Clearing Systems in the UK is drawing up standards for the
shimmering slivers of foil to be used on cheques.
The extent of cheque fraud is difficult to calculate. In 1990, Apacs
believes it totalled about Pounds 17.7m, although that dropped in 1991. But
many say the figure is far higher, with individuals and companies unaware
they have been defrauded - or unwilling to admit it. Guy Johnson, of the
West Midlands Police cheque squad, says this kind of theft is widespread and
is replacing the traditional 'smash-and-grab'.
The police face two problems. First, counterfeiting, where the name or value
on a cheque is changed. Second, forgery where the basic document, such as a
cheque, is copied.
Forgery has become increasingly easy as colour photocopiers and colour
scanners have enabled the dishonest to replicate cheques, tickets and
vouchers. 'These are dangerous things because they are getting quite
ubiquitous,' says Philip Hudson, managing director of De La Rue
Holographics. 'They're also very difficult because the police can't trace
the cheques: there are no tell-tale signs.'
Ian Kellett, chief accountant with mail-order company Grattan, which plans
to use cheques incorporating holograms from the new year, believes his
company was quick to recognise the risks of such advanced technology because
they themselves are users of it. 'We related to desktop publishing because
we use it in our business for catalogue creation. We wanted to take the
cheque out of this printing environment.'
While complex patterns, fluorescent inserts and water marks have all failed
to deter the dedicated forger, hologram makers believe their products will
succeed because they are difficult to replicate. 'They can't be copied or
photographed. To replicate them you would need the same technology as we
have,' says Hamish Shearer, technical director of Applied Holographics.
Producing a hologram requires clean rooms similar to those involved in
semiconductor production.
In brief, the hologram pattern is created by splitting a laser beam in two:
half falls on a photographic plate; the other half shines on to the art work
before reaching the plate. The way in which this pattern interferes with the
pure beam determines the final hologram. After further processes, the plates
are coated with molecules of pure silver, then topped with nickel. The
plates are then used to build up a printing cylinder for mass production.
Stephen Adams, divisional director of the security print and systems
division of Kenrick &amp; Jefferson, believes OVDs should be used with other
techniques to prevent fraud. 'We never advocate a single security feature,'
says Adams. 'It has to be a more and more covert system to track the fraud
down the line.'
Johnson believes otherwise. He argues that the banks should spend their
money on a single technology which cannot be copied and which is easily
recognisable by everyone likely to handle the cheque - from the banker to
the shopkeeper in the local store. 'Unless the receiver of the document
knows what the document looks like, how can we stop counterfeiting?' asks
Johnson. 'If the counterfeited document is rarely seen, such as a building
society cheque, how do you know whether it is counterfeit or not?'
Two obstacles had to be overcome to put holograms on cheques. The first was
to ensure that the hologram stuck and could not be removed. The paper used
for cheques is highly textured so adhesion can be difficult. And the heat
and pressure needed to apply the OVD has to be carefully controlled so that
it does not destroy other security features.
The second was to ensure the integrity of automated cheque processing. If
the hologram had been thick - it is just 2.5 microns, or millionths of a
metre, deep - 'piggybacking' could occur, where the build up of a 'bump' in
the pile of cheques results in some of them slipping through the automated
process without being read.
Estimates for the market growth of holograms for security and
anti-counterfeiting vary widely. But Morris Weissman, chief executive
officer of United States Banknote, one of the biggest hologram suppliers,
reports market-growth of 75 to 80 per cent over the past year. 'We expect
the same kind of growth in the coming year,' he adds.
Manufacturers say this is because several drawbacks have been ironed out.
Now the devices can be easily incorporated in factory production lines -
just like a stick-on label. And prices are falling.
The cost of putting holograms on cheques works out at less than 1p per
cheque - conventional cheques cost three or four pence each. On top of that
is the cost of designing the hologram - anything from Pounds 2,000 upwards.
Other documents have already been given the hologram treatment. Wembley
Stadium tickets contain holograms, as did all the tickets for the 1992
Olympic Games. Season tickets on the Illinois mass transport system in the
US also bear an OVD as do postal stamps in several countries.
Another big growth area is in packaging to ensure that seals on prescription
drugs, software or video cassettes are not broken.
Whether a company is distilling whisky or making jeans, holograms can help
it protect its label.
Appropriately, even Batman is in on the act. Every licensed Batman product
sold in the US last year incorporated a hologram in the packaging.

<TEXT>
Researchers at Toshiba's environmental engineering laboratory have developed
a way of reclaiming fuel oil from chloride-based plastics, such as PVC and
polypropylene.
The difficulty in recycling these chloride-based plastics is that they give
off harmful hydrogen chloride gas when heated.
The Toshiba process puts smashed plastics into a reacting chamber, as with
traditional reclamation processes. However, a high-density alkaline solution
is then added which transforms hydrogen chloride into a harmless salt when
heated.
Because the alkaline solution decomposes some of the plastic additives that
resist heat, the retrieval rate for oils rises from 50 per cent to 90 per
cent. Toshiba: Japan, 03 3457 4511.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Technology: Banknotes that leap out at you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central banks are always trying to keep a step ahead of banknote
counterfeiters by weaving metal strips into notes or cotton threads soaked
in ultraviolet dye, and by the traditional - and most reliable - defence of
watermark paper.
But, from Austria to Australia, holograms or their sister-product,
kinegrams, are beginning to make an appearance on banknotes, and could
become more common if current efforts to overcome technical problems are
successful.
According to Stanley Kreitman, president of US Banknote, holograms have two
advantages when used on banknotes. First, they are simply another
anti-counterfeiting technique to make the forger's job harder. Second, they
prevent the increasingly prevalent method of counterfeiting by colour-copier
 -holograms are 3D, while a copier works in only one dimension.
One of the first uses of a hologram on a banknote was in Australia, on the
bicentennial Dollars 10 note. In Austria, the national bank began issuing a
Sch5,000 note in 1990 using a stamp-sized kinegram in the shape of Mozart's
head.
The kinegram, developed by Switzerland's Landis &amp; Gyr Communications,
changes position from left to right with movement of the note. Switzerland
plans to use it in what will be the world's first full series of banknotes
with kinegrams, now in development and due for issue in three or four years'
time.
Holograms and kinegrams are stamped on to the notes with a hot press. But
while the holograms can be produced economically, says Kreitman, applying it
to the note in exactly the same spot is difficult.
US Banknote is experimenting with holograms in two ways: it is trying to put
a true holographic strip in the note - current efforts do not give a 3D
look; and it is working with one of the world's biggest chemical groups on a
way of printing the hologram on the note as it is being produced. 'We're not
too far away,' says Kreitman.
Achieving this could well overcome the US Treasury's anxieties about wear
and tear on the hologram when applied via hot stamping. But it is a bit too
early to predict when the mighty greenback will bear a hologram, or who or
what might appear on it.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Management: Codes of ethics on a wing and a prayer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following in the footsteps of their more self-conscious American brethren,
more and more European companies are introducing codes of ethics.
At first sight they look impressive to the 'stakeholders' at whom they are
aimed - employees, suppliers, customers and the wider community. But how
many are really worth the paper they are written on?
Much depends on how they are drawn up, according to Richard Harries, the
Bishop of Oxford. In many companies they are formulated by a small group at
the top.
But the Bishop disparaged such codes last night in a London Business School
lecture on 'the morality of good business'.
Instead, he advocated a lengthy process of consultation in which everyone
affected could participate. His own diocese had involved all of its
parochial church councils in drawing up a Vision, Priorities and Targets
paper, he said. The process took two years.
Itemising other requirements needed to make codes of conduct effective, the
Bishop said they should be expressions of, not substitutes for, a
deeply-imbued sense of corporate values.
Rather than just being applied in a 'minimalist, legalistic way', they were
effective only when they were seen to be part of a corporate culture with a
strong sense of moral purpose about what the company did and how it did it.
Codes should be communicated widely and kept constantly effective, said the
Bishop. The next stage for companies must be to review and monitor them.
Adequate mechanisms must be set up to test 'the effectiveness, the reality,
of what exists on paper'.
Comparing the existence of codes of conduct in Britain with other
industrialised countries, the Bishop cited statistics which suggest that
about 75 per cent of US companies now have them, against 40 per cent of
companies in Germany and France in 1988, but only 28 per cent of Britain in
1991.
However, this was well up on the 18 per cent in 1987. The Bishop expressed
confidence that the increase would continue.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Management: Streetwise in the inner city - Poor urban areas
pose special problems for businesses, and managers will need new skills if
they are to meet the challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHEL SYRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An international company decides to open a subsidiary in a country where it
has had no previous presence. The expatriate manager has no experience in
the country, does not speak the language and has no knowledge of the local
culture or way of doing business.
Daft? Not as daft as a domestic company which opens an outlet in an inner
city with an ethnically-diverse population and then appoints a manager from
the suburbs to run it without the right training or experience, says Joanna
Howard, research director at Roffey Park Management Centre*.
Howard is conducting research into the skills needed by inner city managers.
She argues that urban renewal programmes conducted by government agencies,
local industry and community associations in many of Britain's
worst-affected inner cities are undertaken without proper consideration of
the skills needed to run the initiatives.
The characteristics of these urban areas - broad cultural mix, pockets of
gentrification, housing difficulties, dense population and a high potential
for the entrepreneurial spirit - impose distinct demands on managers,
regardless of their business.
'It's in inner cities that our major black communities live, and other
communities with rich and different cultural backgrounds,' she says.
'The model of management that relies on everyone working from the same
cultural assumptions may well fall down in this kind of setting. The manager
who pays attention to 'what matters here' at an everyday, as well as at a
deeper, level has a better chance of succeeding.'
This may mean being able to manage large numbers of part-time and casual
workers, or being aware of how the experience of long-term poverty,
unemployment or racial harassment affects people.
Being more sensitive to the safety and security of employees is one example.
'Simple things like putting lighting in company car parks or arranging
transport for your female managers if they work late will do wonders for
your staff turnover,' says one personnel manager.
The security of employees is a particular problem for Colin Allies, district
general manager of British Gas in Southwark, a south London borough with a
high crime rate in its many high-rise housing estates.
Maintenance engineers are now accompanied by less-skilled colleagues and
meter inspectors are equipped with radios. Both measures were introduced
following the establishment of working parties between management and staff
to consider safety issues.
Allies says teamwork and employee communication are particularly important
in inner city settings. 'I'm not saying they aren't important in other parts
of the country,' he says.
'However the need to use these skills more effectively is more acute in
areas where there is this high ethnic tension and distrust between
communities.'
Much the same could be said of involvement in community projects. Community
work is generally regarded as good corporate behaviour, but the networks it
provides for managers in inner city communities could be vital in attracting
and retaining good staff.
Managers might also gain a greater understanding of the local demand for
their organisations' services or products or the need for special credit or
loan arrangements.
Philip Morris was manager of the Brixton branch of the Marks and Spencer
clothing and food chain when riots erupted in the south London borough in
1981. He found his involvement in community affairs played a critical role
in maintaining the standing of the company locally.
'During the turmoil, people turned to M and S as an oasis of calm. They felt
safe inside our doors. It really drove home how important it is for
businesses to take an interest in the people around them. I still feel a
sense of pride in the fact that the M and S name I placed on the 'We're
backing Brixton' sign over the railway bridge is still up there after 10
years.'
Employee recruitment, training and appraisal are another challenge.
Corning Glass in the US, for example, introduced reforms to their personnel
policies in the wake of internal surveys that suggested female and black
employees were leaving the company at twice the rate of their white male
counterparts.
The reforms included weeding out hidden biases in selection and appraisal
procedures and introducing workshops to give employees a chance to air their
concerns.
The team responsible for improving the opportunities for black workers went
further, working with local chambers of commerce to persuade grocery stores
to place black hair products on their shelves and talking local TV stations
into adding black entertainment programmes to the line up.
'Corning's example shows how important it is for inner city managers to
think outside their immediate mindset and see how employment policies need
to be linked to reforms in the local culture, networks and amenities,' says
Beatrice Young, founder of the culture change practice of Harbridge House,
the US consultancy that has pioneered human resources strategies.
'This requires lateral thinking on a scale that would not be needed in other
environmental circumstances,' she says.
lain Vallance, British Telecom's chairman, recently said the ability of UK
industry to trade profitably in inner cities depended 'very considerably' on
the health of the local community.
'If that health is adversely affected by deprivation, crime, vandalism,
racial tension, inner city decay, homelessness or pollution, so too is our
own business health. Our opportunities are reduced, our problems increase,
our costs rise,' he said.
The scale of inner city regeneration in Britain means that companies need
more managers who understand other cultures. But Howard argues that inner
city workers rarely win promotion to middle management.
The question facing employers is how to support and foster inner city
managers who can 'match' the organisational culture of middle and senior
management with the values that make them effective in their work.
It means, says Howard, 'helping a person value what they bring to their role
as managers because of their differing background, rather than in spite of
it.'

FT  11 DEC 92 / Management: Japan adapts to western practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese managers are discovering the importance of managing people, rather
than factories, in their efforts to cope with worsening economic conditions.
This message has been spread by consultants from Tokyo's Nomura Research
Institute during a world lecture tour on how Japan is dealing with slow
growth.
NRI says executives are even adopting the management priorities of western
companies. Profits have already replaced sales at the top of the Japanese
management agenda, guaranteed lifetime employment is becoming a thing of the
past and the interests of shareholders are increasingly important.
But more important changes are also taking place. Traditionally, executives
have concentrated on improving productivity. Now 'serious consideration is
being given to methods of running organisations based on people', according
to Shiro Tanikawa, a senior management consultant at NRI.
By fostering a sense of individuality, for example, companies are finding it
easier to move managers between jobs and manager mobility has allowed
several companies to restructure in recent months.
Another break with the past is a growing willingness by Japanese companies
to buy in new product concepts, a trend which NRI says could lead to
expanded links with domestic and foreign companies. It tags the process with
a new management catch-phase: Kyo-sei, or 'global symbiotic co-operation'.
One contributing factor has been the westernising of the Japanese economy:
the service sector has grown, capital costs more, working hours are shorter
and consumer desires have become more diverse.
The result, according to Takeshi Murakami of NRI's consumer and services
industries department, is that 'Japanese-style management and US and
European-style management are moving closer together.'

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (6): Intriguing contradictions -
Scotland's position in the EC pecking order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE states of the European Community tackle the difficult challenge of
widening membership and deepening cooperation, Scotland faces a series of
European tests of its own.
The country has to secure its position in the pecking order governing the
distribution of keenly fought over EC regional funds. It must seek to
maximise benefits from the EC's 'single market' formally being put into
place next year - a development which could bring particular benefits for
Scottish financial services. And Scotland has to make its voice heard in the
debate in Brussels and national capitals about 'subsidiarity' - allowing
government decision-making to be carried out as close as possible to the
people.
Scotland's relationship with the EC throws up some intriguing
contradictions. On the one hand, there is no argument about whether Scotland
gets 'value for money' from the EC. It clearly does. As a region suffering
from industrial decline, with a disproportionate share of rural areas
requiring special support, Scotland has attracted a large amount of EC
funding to help depressed areas.
Mr Ian Lang, secretary of state for Scotland, recently pointed out that
Scotland had benefited from nearly Pounds 1.5bn in structural fund
assistance from Brussels since 1979. 'Denmark, like Scotland a small country
at the north of Europe, but without the clout which the UK carries in the
Community, has secured just one-sixth of that total,' Mr Lang declared.
On the other hand, in the future battle for EC cash and industrial
investment, Scotland will face some disadvantages. Mr Grant Baird, the head
of Scotland's recently-established representative office in Brussels,
Scotland Europa, sums up the position: 'Competition is going to get tougher.
The funds will be coming. But any growth will be going to the poorer
countries.'
The gap in economic output per head between Scotland and the rest of the UK
has narrowed in recent years, principally because Scotland has better
weathered the downturn. Moreover, as a result of the accession of poorer
southern countries during the past decade, Scottish gross domestic product
(gdp) per head is about the EC average.
Further, the shift in the Community's centre of gravity both eastwards and
southwards has sharpened the problem of Scotland's peripheral position.
Scotland in the past has relied on the US more than the rest of Europe for
inward investment. Now Scottish industry is looking far more actively
towards Europe.
But corporate and government managers are aware that, when German companies
seek a foothold in the EC, Scotland is now well down the priority list for
investment.
'Scottish industry has not been very good at attracting EC money,' says Mr
Baird, 'often because it doesn't know it is there.' One reason for the
establishment of Scotland Europa was to put Scottish enterprises and
institutions firmly on the Brussels map, searching for funds in, for
example, EC research programmes.
Scotland has already qualified for EC grants in the troubled fields of
coal-mining, shipbuilding and textiles. Now it will be trawling for
assistance from the EC's planned new programme for 'reconversion' of defence
and electronics industries hit by the post-cold war downturn in European
armaments spending.
Another part of Scotland Europa's activities is to point out that, in a
range of economic matters, Scotland's interests do not always necessarily
coincide with those of the rest of the UK. Putting forward the Scotch whisky
industry's point of view on EC alcohol levies, or making known the interests
of Scottish power companies on European emission control plans, are two
examples of Scotland Europa's work.
In another area of special interest, Scotland has put in a bid for at least
part of the activities of the European central bank, designed to run
Europe's monetary affairs if and when economic and monetary union takes
place towards the end of the 1990s.
Scotland's bid has not been helped by rival campaigns from London and
Manchester. Additionally, the effort has been hard hit by the UK's
withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism in September. None the less,
Edinburgh will be doing its best to press its candidature during this week's
EC summit. The Royal Bank of Scotland is printing a special issue of
Europeanised pound notes to coincide with the summit. A few are likely to be
handed out as ceremonial gifts to heads of government.
Having been part of monetary union with England since 1707, Scots have fewer
qualms than people south of the border about giving up sovereignty to an EC
central bank. But Scottish analysts also believe that Emu will be
impracticable unless accompanied by a political union to provide a framework
for intra-Community fiscal transfers necessary to make a single currency
work.
The debate about Scotland's place in Europe has been greatly affected both
by the delays to the Maastricht process and by the setback for the Scottish
National Party and the Labour party in April's general election. Up to this
spring, many moderate Scots could support the idea of an eventual Scottish
parliament dealing directly with a strengthened European executive in
Brussels.
Now, both notions - Scottish devolution (or full-scale independence), and a
move towards a Maastricht-style federation in Europe - appear illusory.
Scotland's voice in Europe will be heard firmly from within existing UK
institutions; it seems unlikely that it will be very loud.
The EC intends to set up a 'Committee of the Regions,' acting as an advisory
body to the Commission and Council of Ministers on matters of regional
importance. Unlike the position of other countries with a federal structure,
Scotland however has no clear-cut right to send elected representatives to
the committee.
It has been assumed that Scotland would take up four seats out of the UK's
allotment of 24 members of the committee, made up of representatives of
Scottish local authorities. According to recent indications, however, the
Scottish Office appears to believe that representation on the committee is
purely a matter for the UK government to decide. This flies in the face of
'subsidiarity' - and could be a point of considerable irritation for the
Scots.
As Mr Craig Campbell of the Scottish Council Development and Industry puts
it in a paper published this week, 'The overwhelming majority of members of
the House of Commons supports the UK's active membership of the Community .
. . The irony is that at a detailed policy level, the different parts of the
UK can have very different interests, and there is not yet any adequate
mechanism for expression of those interests.'

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (7): Fortune on the ebb tide - Recession
has hit the Highlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE depressing signs that the tide of good fortune which for the past
few years has buoyed up the economy of many parts of the Highlands and
Islands is ebbing.
Most seriously, crisis affects the two offshore fabrication yards on the
Moray Firth; a year ago, they were employing nearly 5,000 people between
them. Now the total number of people employed at both yards is less than
half that figure, and one of them may have no work at all by next March.
The recession, which took so long to reach Scotland and its northern
extremity, is now having a serious effect on the Highlands. Fewer tourists
came last summer. Boarded up hotels, restaurants and bars dot the landscape,
while manufacturers are suffering from the weakness of markets in the rest
of Britain.
As Mr Tony Mackay, an Inverness-based economist, says: 'Over the past 20
years the Highland economy has often done better than that of the UK and of
Scotland as a whole. Now we are going to experience underperformance for
five to ten years.'
The 1980s were good for the Highlands. Although two big industrial plants,
the aluminium smelter at Invergordon and a paper mill at Fort William,
closed early in the decade, later economic development was more organic. The
offshore steel fabrication yards were set up on the Moray Firth because they
wanted to be there rather having to be coaxed to uneconomic locations.
The same goes for the salmon farms established along the sealochs and inlets
of the west coast, which created a few thousand jobs, revitalised some
remote communities but dismayed conservationists and lovers of solitude.
The Highland population was boosted by an influx of people from England and
from other parts of Scotland - the co-called white settlers. They pushed up
the populations of places such as the Isle of Skye, sometimes forcing house
prices out of the range of the indigenous inhabitants but bringing more
entrepreneurial spirit.
Though emigration from places such as the Western Isles continued, the total
population of the area covered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) -
the development network which replaced the Highlands and Islands Development
Board - rose from 364,000 to 370,000 between 1981 and 1991.
Unemployment was 10.3 per cent in September, below the figure for Great
Britain of 11.5 per cent but more than a percentage point worse than it had
been a year before.
Until recently the Inverness area was doing best: it has developed as the
shopping and administrative centre for almost the whole area, and has been
underpinned by the well-paid employment at the nearby fabrication yards.
However, in July, the US-owned McDermott yard at Ardersier on the south side
of the Moray Firth made 1,200 of its 2,500 employees redundant after an
important order from Elf-Enterprise went elsewhere. Its current order book
will be exhausted by February, and soon after that, if no new orders are
gained, there will be be only a skeleton staff of about 100 keeping the
facility operating on a care and maintenance basis.
At Nigg on the north side, Highland Fabricators recently won an order from
the Norwegian sector of the North Sea which will enable it to maintain at
least 400 of its current workforce of 2,200 well into 1994. The crisis in
the offshore market is still emphasised by the large number of idle drilling
rigs tied up in the Cromarty Firth.
The two yards face a dearth of orders as the current phase of offshore
developments works its way out, and the market may not recover for three
years. But employment at the yards has always fluctuated wildly; both rely,
to a large extent, on sub-contractor labour rather than on large permanent
workforces.
'It is very important that we retain both yards - they have given the
economy critical mass,' says Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of HIE. It
is also considered important that as many families of the yards' employees
stay living in the area, even if the menfolk go elsewhere for work. HIE has
set up a task force to help workers increase their flexibility in the
offshore industry by gaining extra qualifications.
Down in the Cowal peninsula in the far south-west corner of the HIE area,
about 800 jobs are being lost because of the closure, earlier this year, of
the US Navy's Holy Loch submarine base. Argyll and the Isles Enterprise is
working on a plan to assist the area by helping tourism and light
manufacturing.
Another gloomy spot is Caithness, where the Atomic Energy Authority's plant
at Dounreay is gradually running down, threatening the economy of a sparsely
populated area. It currently employs 1,600 people, making it easily the
biggest employer, but the prototype fast reactor is scheduled to close in
1994, and the fuel reprocessing plant in 1997. By then employment, which was
2,100 in 1988, may have dropped to 530.
Across the Highlands sheepfarming, the mainstay of crofters, faces changes
because of the MacSharry reforms of the EC's Common Agriculture Policy. But
Mr Donald MacRae at TSB Bank Scotland does not think the reforms are bad
news for crofters, at least in the short term, because the proportion of the
subsidy made up by the headage payment per sheep will increase and the total
payment should also rise slightly.
'The problem is that there will be less incentive to improve quality, and
the farmers are facing the political risk that the taxpayer will eventually
say the whole thing is far too expensive,' he says.
The next two years are likely to be bad for Highland fishermen as EC catch
restrictions bite harder, but in the longer term the Highlands' share of
Scottish white fish landings may increase as fishermen move west from the
North Sea.
The salmon farming industry is doing a little better, after several years of
very low prices, now that Norway, the biggest producer, has cut
overproduction, helping prices to rise. However, rationalisation is taking a
toll: in September Marine Harvest, the leading producer, was sold by
Unilever to MariFarms of the US (in which Hanson has a minority stake). The
new owners are making 160 employees redundant, most of them in the Fort
William area.
At least these setbacks are hitting an economy more mature than it was a
decade ago. There are more businesses and more accumulated wealth, and a
better infrastructure of roads, bridges and digital telecommunications
links.
But it will be a severe test for the new HIE network of 10 local enterprise
companies scattered over the region, with half the organisation's 300 staff,
and devolved financial, social and environmental functions. Mr Robertson
says HIE is giving people a power they never previously had, to change
things in their areas. 'There couldn't be a better time for it to win its
spurs.'

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (8): Banking on strengths - The financial
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH EQUITABLE, the life assurance company, is setting up a life
assurance company in the German state of Wurttemberg, a joint venture with
the composite insurance company Wurttembergische.
It thus becomes the first Scottish life company to finalise a joint venture
with a German company - and one of the first British companies to enter the
German life assurance market since Germany agreed, early this year, to
liberalise its life assurance market under the EC's third life assurance
directive.
The deal is one of a number in which Scottish financial institutions are
entering the continental financial services market - a sign of the current
vigour of Scottish life offices, one of the few growth spots in the
financial communities of Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In the first six months of 1992, income from new premiums for the nine
Scottish life companies, of which Standard Life is easily the biggest, rose
by no less than 35 per cent: from Pounds 2.3bn to Pounds 3.2bn. At a time
when Scottish banks and other companies in financial services have been
cutting jobs, the Scottish Life increased its staff employed in Scotland by
five per cent in the first half of 1992; to 14,100. Unsurprisingly, offices
of the life companies still proliferate in Edinburgh.
In March 1992, according to the Department of Employment, some 217,000
people worked in banking, insurance and finance. Among financial centres
outside London Scotland is eclipsed only by the north-west of England in
terms of employment, but it has its own particular strengths.
Unlike any other British region it has its own clearing banks. It has a
notable community of independent fund managers. Yet it has few building
societies - and no markets. Its representation in non-life insurance is
largely confined to General Accident, the Perth-based composite. There are
only a few merchant banks.
The financial sector exploits the perception that Scots are canny and
trustworthy in handling money. Scottish Financial Enterprise (SFE), the
sector's trade association, puts 'Trust the Scots' on all faxes.
The three Scottish banks are suffering along with their English
counterparts. For a time they were shielded - the Scottish economy held out
longer against recession; but two draw more than half their business from
south of the border.
A few weeks ago the Royal Bank of Scotland announced 3,500 job cuts in its
branch network over the next five years - a move which follows that of other
clearers. Last week it announced a further big drop in pretax profits after
making increased provisions for bad debts. But operating profits were up. In
the same week it mounted a robust defence of the Pounds 6m bonus paid to Mr
Peter Wood, the director who set up and then sold to the bank its insurance
arm Direct Line.
Clydesdale Bank, a subsidiary of National Australia Bank, shed about 500
jobs at its Glasgow headquarters. But it increased operating profit by 13
per cent last financial year, despite a jump in provisions for bad and
doubtful debts.
Among the fund managers, the Edinburgh-based partnership of Baillie Gifford
appears to be pulling strongly ahead of its Scottish rivals, with Pounds 5bn
under management, double the 1987 figure. It was recently selected to manage
part of Wellcome Trust's portfolio, the medical charity, and sees this as
recognition that it is on a par with the big London-based independent fund
managers.
In Glasgow, Murray Johnstone has largely recovered from a period of
uncertainty; it had Pounds 3.4bn under management in the middle of the year.
Scottish institutions, whose overseas orientation - if they had one - used
to be towards the US, are now looking with a little more interest to the
continent of Europe. Last spring Bank of Scotland took a 45 per cent stake
in Finannziaria Italiana Mutui (FIM), which operates in the expanding
Italian residential mortgage market. It also has a joint venture in Germany
with Quelle Bank.
Last month Scottish Financial Enterprise became a founder member of the
Association of European Regional Centres (AERFC), which was formed to
represent the interests of secondary financial centres in the EC.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (5): A certain level of dismay - The
water industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE government's proposals to change local government in Scotland by
moving towards single-tier authorities look like gaining grudging
acceptance, this cannot be said of a possible consequence of these reforms:
the privatisation of the Scottish water and sewerage industry.
Water and sewerage services in Scotland were not privatised when the English
water companies were sold in 1989; they are run by nine regional and the
three island councils.
As these councils are to be restructured, the Scottish Office believes it
will be necessary to come to new arrangements for water. The idea that
privatisation should form part of these new arrangements has caused dismay.
An opinion poll in The Herald, the Glasgow morning newspaper, found that
only 4 per cent of Scots canvassed showed themselves in favour of
privatisation. Only 9 per cent of the Conservatives who were asked supported
it.
Mr Bruce Black, senior deputy secretary at the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities, says: 'Scottish people do not like the idea of privatisation.
It offends the presbyterian ethic which says that the government should
supply essential services.
'They particularly do not like the idea of water privatisation. Water is
seen as one of Scotland's abundant resources.
'They have seen what has happened in England. Private water companies have
raised the money for investment through higher charges. People who have been
unable to meet the charges have been disconnected.'
Another argument advanced by the Scottish Office for changing the water and
sewerage arrangments is that heavy capital expenditure will be needed over
the next 10 to 15 years, to comply with government regulations and EC
directives on water standards.
These include the Water Supply (Water Quality)(Scotland) regulations 1990,
which adopted the standards of the EC directive on the quality of drinking
water. The British Government also adopted the Urban Wastewater Treatment
Directive and the Bathing Water Directive. There is also a need to stop
dumping sewerage sludge at sea by 1998.
The Scottish Office estimates that meeting these requirements will cost
Pounds 2.5bn in Scotland. A further Pounds 2.5bn will be needed for
maintenance and upgrading and improving unsatisfactory sewage discharges.
The regional councils are investing Pounds 218m a year in capital spending.
Professor George Fleming of the department of civil engineering at
Strathclyde University says: 'The extra Pounds 5bn will probably mean a
doubling of the annual capital spending to over Pounds 400m. Whatever new
system is contrived, charges will have to rise.'
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, indicates that he does not want the
extra spending to be met by increased public borrowing by local authorities.
He argues that more spending on water could mean less spending on other
services such as education and health.
Last July Mr Lang said he was looking at ways 'in which the private sector
might contribute enterprise and investment' to water. This was taken to mean
privatisation.
Since then, however, the Scottish Office has published a consultation paper
called Water and Sewerage in Scotland: Investing For Our Future.
It repeats arguments for changing the current arrangements and puts forward
eight options - including privatisation, which could involve setting up
three companies which would either be floated on the stock exchange or sold
off in a trade sale.
But there are also proposals for a national water authority which would have
a watchdog body similar to the National Rivers Authority in England; a
number of joint water boards serving single-tier councils; straightforward
transfer from the old councils to the new; and some form of franchising
whereby the local authorities, or groups of them, would retain ownership and
control of the water and sewerage installations, contracting out operation
to private concerns.
As with the proposed changes to local government, Mr Lang tries to make it
clear that nothing has been definitely decided about water. He says in his
foreword: 'The Government will reach a decision on the right way forward in
the light of responses to this consultation paper. Until then I intend to
keep my options open.'
The only certainty is that if the investment required is made, water charges
will have to rise. Scots water users now pay an average of Pounds 132 a year
for water - though many are unaware of it, because water charge is collected
with the poll tax. The average charge in England and Wales is Pounds 177.
As the government waits for reaction to come in, the public view appears to
be captured by Mr Henry McLeish, a Labour spokesman on Scotland: 'We don't
dispute the need for Pounds 5bn investment over 10 to 15 years. We accept
that water charges will have to rise to help pay for it. But we don't want
the higher charges to swell the profits of private companies. The Treasury
should allow the councils to borrow the extra money needed.'

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (4): Mr Lang's open options - The local
government debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish Secretary, introduced his second discussion
document on local government in Scotland in October, he might have hoped
that debate would centre on possible cost savings and on the new council map
involved in moving towards a single tier of unitary authorities.
An earlier paper published in 1991 indicated that the Conservatives would
move towards a single tier of local government if they won the general
election. It implicitly ruled out the creation of a Scottish parliament.
The new document sets out in more detail the government's case for replacing
the current two-tier structure of nine regional, three (single tier) island
and 51 district councils.
But it has left its options open on the new council structure and put
forward scenarios involving between 15 and 51 councils, with joint boards to
provide services such as education and police, where administration by a
large number of unitary authorities would be inefficient.
Mr Lang has since emphasised that he has reached no decision on the new
local council map of Scotland. There was no masterplan ready to be dusted
off, he said. He wanted widespread debate.
But - perhaps predictably - initial public reactions have been political.
Professor Alan Alexander, who is director of the Scottish Local Authorities
Management Centre at Strathclyde University, says:
'This document is politically driven. The aim is to break up Labour control
of local government. In particular there is a wish to be rid of the great
Labour fiefdoms of Strathclyde and Lothian.
'But the government might be out of luck. Research has shown that however
you slice the cake the Conservatives would not pick up control of many
councils. I think there is a strong argument for unitary authorities but it
is not the one put forward in this discussion document.' Prof Alexander
admits he is a Labour supporter.
At the moment the Conservatives control none of the regional councils and
only five of the districts. Many of the councils are hung.
Mr Mark Lazarowicz, the leader of the Labour group on Edinburgh district
council, has similar views.
He says: 'I do not know that it is politically driven because it probably
would result in few gains to the Conservatives. Certainly it is
ministerially driven.
'Mr Lang needs something to do over the next few years and it is likely
there will be a single tier of government.
'Our position is that a single tier makes sense only if there is a Scottish
parliament. Labour party policy is for a Scottish parliament. If we cannot
have a parliament we are happy with the way things are. We work very well
with Lothian regional council and there is hardly any overlap of functions.'
If Edinburgh were made a unitary authority, he asks, 'How would you service
the parts of Lothian which are sparsely populated? More important, how would
you ensure the people of Lothian were adequately represented?'
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) takes the view that a
change in the current system is unwanted and unnecessary. Mr Bruce Black,
the senior deputy secretary, says: 'Few of our members welcome these
proposals, although of course, when push comes to shove, some of the bigger
district authorities might want to become unitary authorities.
'The current system works well. You need regional councils to handle
strategic areas like water and roads. You need the economies of scale you
can achieve. You also need the district councils, particularly in remote
areas, to respond to local needs.'
But when Mr David McLetchie, vice-president of the Scottish Conservative &amp;
Unionist Association, is asked to comment on Cosla's views, his reply is
robust: 'They would say that. Cosla is dominated by the Labour party.'
However, he adds: 'It would be less than honest if we didn't acknowledge
that part of the appeal of these proposals is the political case against the
large Labour strongholds.
'But this should not obscure the cogent arguments in favour of reforming
local government.'
Stripped of the political overtones, the arguments, as set out in the
discussion document, can be summarised as follows:
Under the present system there is confusion about which tier is responsible
for which functions;
There is an overlapping of functions which results in waste - and bloated
employment levels. Although regional councils have been in existence since
1975, many people still think of themselves as living in the now-extinct
counties.
Streamlining local government would accord with the government's desire to
move from councils providing most services themselves, to becoming
'enabling' authorities which might contract out many functions to other
bodies or the private sector.
There would also be cost savings. A report by the accountants Touche Ross
for the discussion document estimated a that a 15-authority structure could
save an estimated Pounds 192m a year, a 24-authority structure Pounds 120m a
year and a 35 unit structure Pounds 55m a year. But a 51 council would cost
Pounds 58m more a year than the existing setup.
These figures are tentative; not everybody agrees there would be cost
savings. It would depend on whether existing facilities were used, on new
staffing and computer systems and on a range of other factors. However the
idea that 51 council structure would cost more money almost certainly rules
this out as a choice.
At the other extreme a 15-council scheme would be rather too similar for
comfort to the existing regional council arrangements, despite the estimated
cost saving.
Prof Alexander has doubts about cost savings but still favours a move
towards a single tier system. His argument is that the near-monopoly of
service delivery held by local government has been broken by changes in
housing legislation and education; and by the introduction of compulsory
competitive tendering for many local authority services.
In short, he implies, the development of the enabling council has gone so
far that people's democratic rights are weakened when residual services are
spread between two tiers of local government.
He advocates a system of single unitary councils for most of Scotland with
two tiers in the remote areas of the Highlands, making some 30 councils in
all. There would be a number of area boards for services like fire, policing
but perhaps not water.
Mr McLetchie, who drafted the Conservative party's submission after the
first consultative paper, says: 'I don't know what is going to happen. But I
suspect that you are going to end up with around 30 councils which will not
be dissimilar to the old county council structure you had before the reforms
of 1975.'

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (3): Caledonia grows stern and wild -
James Buxton finds a shortage of green shoots in the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHARLES LOVE, the new chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank, was blunt
about Scotland's short-term economic prospects when he presented the
Glasgow-based bank's results last month.
'There are no green shoots in Scotland,' he said. A colleague added: 'The
recession has gone on too long for a lot of our customers in Scotland.' But
they did not foresee recovery in the Scottish economy until 1994.
The remarks are typical of the pessimism that has engulfed the Scottish
economy in the last few months.
For the past two years, as much of the rest of the UK economy laboured in
recession, Scotland remained immune from its worst effects. In the summer
there was even an upturn in business confidence in the wake of the UK
general election held in April.
In October, however, the Fraser of Allander Institute, Scotland's main
economic research organisation, declared that the full effects of recession
had finally reached Scotland.
People in Scotland did not like being told that they were suffering a much
milder form of recession than people in the south. This was not just any
penchant they may have for gloom; it simply did not accord with their
experience.
For the past two years the Scottish economy has been virtually stagnant,
with few new business ventures, a stream of small and medium-sized
businesses going into receivership, property developments being stalled or
abandoned, intense financial pressure on companies with large borrowings and
a lack of new job opportunities, so that anyone with a job wanted to hang on
to it.
Yet something remarkable has been happening in this recession in Scotland:
it has not been as bad as in England.
In September the seasonally adjusted uneployment total for Scotland was 9.7
per cent, compared with a UK average of 10.1 per cent, putting Scotland on
exactly the same level as the south-east of England and below Wales and the
northern half of Britain. That, as Professor Gavin McCrone of Glasgow
university pointed out recently, 'is nevertheless much too high to be
acceptable.'
But it is indicative of the changed way in which economic forces have been
working in Britain.
Scotland and the north of England have done better in strictly relative
terms because people in those parts of the UK never built up the enormous
levels of personal debt which their counterparts in the south of England
accumulated.
This may partly be because in Scotland house ownership is just over 50 per
cent of the total housing stock; in England it is 69 per cent. So when
interest rates went up from 1988 onwards, Scotland and the north of England
suffered less.
Consumer spending continued fairly strongly, house prices went on rising
(they have even advanced slightly this year while those in southern England
have collapsed) and the Scottish economy grew faster than that of the UK as
a whole in 1988, 1989 and 1990, while the contraction in Scotland in 1991
was less severe.
Scotland benefited in other ways. There has been an investment boom in the
North Sea oil industry, which particularly helped Grampian and Highland
regions.
Scotland's main manufactured products - whisky, computers and heavy
engineering equipment - are mostly exported, and until about a year ago
their markets had been holding up well.
Yet the gloomy prognostications of the executives of the Clydesdale Bank
seem convincing.
Commentators have for some time forecast that once interest rates came down,
the south of Britain would benefit most - for the same reason that it
suffered most when interest rates were high.
While Scotland hopes to keep its advantage over England, it is more
realistic to trust that the economy of southern England gets going soon, and
that it generates some demand for Scottish goods and services.
Export markets for many different kinds of Scottish goods are weakening,
because of world recession. But perhaps more serious for Scotland's recovery
is the fact that structural factors which formerly worked in Scotland's
favour are now turning against it. Furthermore, there are black spots of
economic decay caused by industrial closures.
The investment boom in the North Sea oil industry is running down, as shown
by the fact that some of the yards which build platforms - one of the first
stages in the process of developing production operations - are now staring
at slender or empty order books, with one of them, McDermotts near
Inverness, currently moving from employing 2,500 people in mid-summer to
going onto a care and maintenance basis.
Offshore oil output is expected to decline in the next year or two, while
pressure on margins is making oil operators cut costs, reducing offshore
employment.
The Shetland islands, where unemployment is about four per cent, will have
to face the fact that the Sullom Voe oil terminal on which much of its
prosperity is based could close by the end of the decade.
Scotland, it has been said, had a good Cold War, so it is now feeling the
consequences of peace. Already the US navy submarine base at Holy Loch has
closed, and four Scottish regiments are being amalgamated into two.
More serious still are the consequences for industry. The future of the
naval dockyard at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth is in the balance as the
government decides whether to close it towards the end of the
century and concentrate all naval refitting work at Devonport in south-west
England, or to mainain two smaller dockyard operations.
Rosyth employs more than 4,000 people and is the biggest industrial site in
Scotland, so its closure would have a devastating effect on the economy of
Fife.
Yarrow, the GEC subsidiary which builds warships on the Clyde, currently has
a good order book but is very dependent on UK government warship orders.
GEC Ferranti in Edinburgh, which has almost halved its workforce from 6,700
in 1989 to about 4,000, is watching anxiously as governments decide the
future of the European fighter aircraft project, for which it would build
the radar. But it has other defence work and recently won a civil contract
for a communication system for the Channel Tunnel trains.
There have been some layoffs, but there have been no big redundancies in the
electronics sector, which employs around 45,000 people. None the less,
Scotland could be vulnerable, as International Business Machines and Compaq,
two personal computer makers which have Scottish plants, fight out price
wars.
In June British Steel's complex at Ravenscraig closed and most of the last
1,200 workers became redundant.
The death of most steelmaking in Lanarkshire is likely to mean that about
5,500 people in other employment in Lanarkshire will lose their jobs in the
next four years - and that comes in addition to the 4,400 steelworkers who
have left British Steel plants since 1990.
Yet it is possible to be optimistic about Lanarkshire. It is no longer the
case that local energy is being devoted to preserving the steel industry -
it is turning to creating new industries in a potentially attractive
location at the very heart of Scotland's transport system, with a Channel
Tunnel terminal planned and an enterprise zone being set up.
With the final closure of Ravenscraig another step has been taken towards a
more balanced structure for the Scottish economy - the evolution of which,
says Prof Peter Payne of Aberdeen university, has been 'wholly beneficial.'
Industry in Scotland, he writes, 'is more healthy than it has been for
generations.'
He adds, however, that 'it is no longer Scottish industry' - 'with many
Scottish companies having lost their independence or, in the case of branch
plants, never having had any."

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (1): Determined difference - Scotland's
increase in prosperity was achieved without the boom-and-bust of the south
of England, but recession has now caught up with the economy. As the
European summit opens in Edinburgh, James Buxton reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF THE heads of government and their acolytes, sitting down at Holyrood
Palace in Edinburgh this morning for the European summit, feel that their
environment is unfamiliar, that is as it should be.
They are in the United Kingdom but they are not in England; for the first
time ever, an international summit of this kind is being held in Scotland.
Scotland, as the Queen remarked in last summer's television programme about
her, is different. Its people have different accents, habits and attitudes;
and they have some of their own specifically Scottish institutions.
It has its own legal system and judiciary. Its education system is different
from that of England and Wales, and Scotland also has its own, presbyterian,
church. Much of the business of government in Scotland is handled by the
Scottish Office in Edinburgh, which in the past 10 years has taken on more
responsibility from Whitehall.
Visitors from the continent will find it one of the more pro-EC parts of the
UK. Compared with people in the south east of England, more Scots either
believe the Maastricht treaty is a good thing in itself or accept that it
needs to go ahead to ensure that the benefits of the single market do not
evaporate.
The idea of European nationality does not worry a people who already have a
kind of dual nationality, being both Scottish and British.
When Mr John Major, the prime minister, told a surprised Scottish
Conservative party conference in 1991 that this European Council would be
held in Edinburgh, he said he wanted to counter the sense of alienation
which he believed outlying parts of Britain felt towards government from
Westminster.
He also wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the union of the United
Kingdom, under which England and Scotland submerged their sovereignties in
1707 and merged their parliaments while retaining their separate identities.
(That is one reason why Scotland does not, as one might have expected of a
European region, have its own parliament or assembly). Through the Edinburgh
summit, Mr Major hoped, Scotland would participate in the enactment of
British foreign policy.
In 1991 the sense of alienation to which Mr Major referred was particularly
strong. Most Scots were fed up with rule by the Conservative party - less
than a quarter of them had voted for it in the 1987 general election. Their
economy had done less well than England's, and they had been alienated by
the policies and personality of Mr Major's predecessor, now Lady Thatcher.
Opinion polls showed that 80 per cent of Scots wanted constitutional change:
some 45 per cent said they wanted a separate Scottish parliament; and 35 per
cent wanted complete independence. Last January the proportion of those
saying they preferred independence surged briefly to 50 per cent.
In Scotland the 1992 general election was partly a battle over those
different prescriptions for Scotland's future, with Labour and the Liberal
Democrats offering a Scottish parliament, the Scottish National party
touting independence and the Conservatives upholding the status quo.
Yet it was Mr Major and the Tories, rather than Labour and the Liberals, who
made the Scottish parliament an election issue - by warning of its dangers
and urging voters across Britain to reject it. Labour, by contrast, kept
quiet about the details of its constitutional plans, apparently for fear of
worrying English and even some Scottish voters.
The election ended in defeat for the backers of constitutional change. Not
only did Labour lose the election nationally but both Labour and the Liberal
Democrats, proponents of a devolved Scottish parliament, saw their shares of
the Scottish vote fall. The SNP increased its vote by seven points but that
did not give it the breakthrough it expected: it lost two seats.
Only the Scottish Tories, who almost everyone - including many of their own
number - had expected to be almost wiped out, were able to claim any sort of
victory; they stood alone in both increasing their vote (marginally) and
winning seats (two).
The general election outcome did not show that demand for constitutional
change in Scotland was dead - though some Tories have since ventured the
thought that Scotland might be entering a 'post-devolution era.' Rather it
demonstrated, like other devolution campaigns for over a century, that not
enough Scots want constitutional change badly enough to give it such a high
priority that they will sink their differences to get it.
It was a reminder that there is residual support in Scotland for unionism.
Since the election, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have played down talk
of constitutional change.
But a little group of protestors who, immediately after the election,
started a vigil outside the building where a Scottish parliament would meet
are still there. They say they will remain until a Scottish parliament is
convened.
The constitutional issue will be raised outside the Holyrood summit, with
Labour and the SNP fielding speakers to the Scotland Demands Democracy
demonstration on Saturday. Mr Major will be asked to explain why, if the
concept of subsidiarity should be applied to the UK, it cannot be applied to
a nation within it.
Since April Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish Secretary, has been showing a more
conciliatory approach to running Scotland. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, his
minister of state, said in July that if the union is not to lose support the
government must choose policies which are not only good for Scotland but
acceptable to most Scots.
Thus, whereas in England and Wales the government is legislating to
encourage many more schools to leave local authority control, nothing
similar is proposed for Scotland.
But the government's attempt to be gentler with the Scots will be tested by
its handling of two big planned reforms - reshaping local government from a
two-tier into a single tier system, and bringing the private sector into the
water and sewerage industry.
The very suggestion of privatising Scottish water has provoked strong
opposition from almost everyone, including many Tories, so the government is
touting (among other options) a complex franchising arrangement.
The reform of local government, removing the regional councils, will enable
Scotland's four cities, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, to become
single tier authorities. But their powers will fall well short of those of
the so-called city-states on the continent, because in the past few years
local government has lost functions and had its financial autonomy
curtailed.
The current mood in Scotland is dour, as the economy stagnates in a
recession which, though less severe than that south of the border, still has
plenty of victims.
But though Scots are accomplished practitioners of 'girning' (grumbling),
plenty of things in their country have improved enormously in the past
decade.
Scotland achieved a big increase in prosperity in the latter part of the
1980s, without the boom and the bust of the south of England. It shows in
the great improvement to life in Glasgow, which used to be a city few people
in Britain visited unless they had to.
The quality of life in Scotland's uncrowded other cities and towns and in
its countryside is an asset which will become more precious as the British
economy begins to grow again.
Yet, unlike in other parts of Britain, the Scottish population is in gentle
decline; it dropped fractionally below the psychologically important 5m mark
in the 1991 census. Somehow the decline seems to mirror the lack of dynamism
in the Scottish economy.
A recent study by Scottish Enterprise, the economic development body,
revealed that Scotland has a lower rate of new company formation than other
parts of Britain, especially the south-east, not to mention Germany and
parts of the US.
Alarmingly, some leading Scots, when interviewed, said they did not believe
the creation of new companies was particularly important - some even thought
that it was undesirable because it harmed existing ones by causing extra
competition.
Many of the more enterprising Scots have moved - as they have been doing for
centuries - to England, where a number of them run big companies and
institutions. Scots also occupy five places in the cabinet - and Scotland
also provides the leader of the opposition, Mr John Smith, and several of
his shadow cabinet.
That could be seen as a success both for the union and for Scots'
determination. But it also shows that in centralised Britain the big
opportunities lie in London. Any step to redressing that imbalance would be
good.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Street discovery fetches Pounds 935,000: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE HIGHLIGHT of a Bonhams sale of Old Masters yesterday was a painting
bought in a street market 30 years ago for a few shillings.
The still life of sea bream, oranges, garlic, a cloth and kitchen utensils,
by Luis Melendez, sold for Pounds 935,000, a record for the 18th-century
Spanish artist.
The sale brought in Pounds 1.45m, a record for any sale at the Knightsbridge
auction house.
At Sotheby's yesterday an aquamanile (a bronze medieval container for
washing the hands) in the shape of a knight on horseback sold for Pounds
660,000. The price was an auction record for an aquamanile. The aquamanile,
made in north Germany in about 1200, was bought by a Continental collector.
The top estimate was Pounds 80,000.
The Bowleaze jewel, a rare 9th-century Anglo-Saxon jewel, probably the
terminal of a manuscript pointer, also received considerable pre-sale
interest and was bought by Mr Robin Symes, a London dealer, for Pounds
41,800. The jewel was found in 1990 on the beach at Bowleaze Cove in Dorset.
It had apparently fallen from the cliff in a landslide.
The European works of art auction totalled Pounds 1.48m in the morning
session and was 12.8 per cent unsold. Mr Danny Katz, another London dealer,
paid Pounds 93,500 for a Florentine bronze stallion made in the workshops of
Antonio Susini in about 1600.
At Bonhams on Wednesday, Ikemasa, a Japanese dealer, paid Pounds 682,000 for
a blue and white early Ming brush washer. The dish re-emerged after being
stolen in 1984 and was sold by Lloyd's of London.

warned yesterday.
Lewes Crown Court, sitting at Hove, East Sussex, disqualified Mr Rodney
Chapman, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, from being a company director for two
years and fined him Pounds 5,000 in a prosecution brought by the executive
earlier this year.
It was the first time a director has been banned under the 1986 Company
Directors Disqualification Act for breaching health and safety law.
The Health and Safety Commission's annual report, published yesterday, shows
that accidents and ill health at work are costing employers up to Pounds 9bn
a year.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Sell-offs fail to boost habit of share ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's privat-isation campaign has failed to encourage wider share
ownership among Britons.
A survey for ProShare, a body that promotes share ownership, found that only
200,000 privatisation buyers also bought other quoted stocks.
The survey also found a decline in the total number of shareholders in
Britain.
'By our reckoning, shareholding peaked at around 11m after the electricity
companies' float in 1990,' Mr Geoffrey Maddrell, ProShare's chief executive,
said. Today the figure is about 9.26m.
Of those, 5.7m shareholders (62 per cent of the total) - nicknamed 'Sids'
after the slogan used in the British Gas campaign - own shares only in
privatised stocks. About 960,000 people (10 per cent of the total) own
shares solely through employee schemes.
ProShare found two other significant groups of shareholders. There are 1.6m
'traditional shareholders' - those who own non-privatised shares and who, if
they hold privatised shares, bought them only after other holdings.
In addition, there are about 800,000 people who were given shares in the
Abbey National flotation who do not own any other shares.
Mr Stuart Valentine, director of research at ProShare, said: 'Privatisations
were made easy but buying shares on the secondary market appears to be
complex.
'People still believe that privatisations are in some way different from
owning other shares.
'Privatisations were seen as a one-way bet but other shares do not attract
special privileges or discounts. The wider stock market is seen by many as a
gamble, and a gamble which they might well lose.'
'Shares are not yet seen as a part of saving. Owning shares is not something
that a respectable married man does in public,' Mr Valentine said.
In the survey, which was conducted by Mori, 9,171 adults were interviewed,
1,973 of them identified as shareholders.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Third top vacancy opens up at BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THIRD high-level vacancy opened at the BBC yesterday when Mr Jonathan
Powell, controller of BBC 1, announced his move to Carlton Television.
Mr Powell's resignation comes a week after Mr Ian Phillips, the BBC's
director of finance, said he was leaving in February.
A replacement has not yet been found for Mr John Tusa, managing director of
the BBC World Service, who retires at the end of this month.
Mr Powell, who has been controller of BBC 1 for five years, will leave the
BBC before Christmas just as Mr John Birt takes over as director-general.
Mr Powell, who will be head of drama and international development at
Carlton, said yesterday: 'It's a very nice, interesting company and a nice,
interesting job.' Carlton takes over the ITV London weekday franchise from
Thames on January 1.
Mr Powell said one of his jobs would be to pursue drama-making opportunities
wherever they could be found.
'Broadcasting is changing so much, the only thing to be is completely
flexible,' he said.
In his time at the BBC, Mr Powell has been responsible for the first regular
production deal with an independent producer - Select TV's hit Birds of a
Feather - successful comedies such as One Foot in the Grave and innovative
drama such as Between The Lines.
He was also responsible for Caught In The Act, a home video clips programme
he now describes as 'a complete bummer'. Then there was Eldorado, the BBC
drama still struggling for life outside BBC 1's Top 30.
Mr Powell had a year of his contract to run - a contract that would probably
not have been renewed.
As a producer, Mr Powell made programmes such as Tinker, Tailor, Soldier,
Spy and Testament of Youth.
When he was head of drama at the BBC his commissions ranged from Casualty
and Edge of Darkness to The Singing Detective and A Very Peculiar Practice.
The three senior vacancies present a short-term headache for Mr Birt, who
takes over from Sir Michael Checkland as director-general on Christmas Eve,
but it also gives him scope for a significant restructuring.
Many people at the BBC expect radical changes in the structure of BBC
Television as a result. It has now become clear that the impending departure
of Mr Phillips had much more to do with the arrival of Mr Birt than the
controversy over the potential overspend at BBC Television.
It is believed that Mr Phillips decided to leave after seeking and failing
to receive an immediate endorsement. A number of senior BBC executives who
were close to Sir Michael believe they may not long survive Mr Birt's
accession.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Industrialists' group takes a sober view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is expected today to receive a downbeat view from a special
panel of industry representatives.
The group combines senior Treasury officials with more than 10 people from
business and a top civil servant from the Department of Trade and Industry.
It adds up to an intriguing experiment by the Treasury to gain economic
insights by mixing the often highly diverse cultures of Whitehall and the
business world.
The panel includes the chief economists of ICI, GKN, BP and RTZ - four of
Britain's biggest companies - as well as a representative from one of
Britain's biggest suppliers of double glazing.
The Treasury's economics prospects group was set up earlier this year to
strengthen the department's contacts with industry and help to improve the
accuracy of its forecasting.
The group is separate from another Treasury panel - the members of which
were announced this week - that is also concerned with economic projections
and is comprised mainly of economists from specialist forecasting groups.
Mr Kevin Mahoney, managing director of Caradon Everest, the double-glazing
subsidiary of the MB-Caradon building products group, and a panel member,
said the meetings were a useful step to improve the dialogue between
Whitehall and the business world.
Mr Mahoney said Treasury officials were 'trying hard to learn the language'
of people who work in in-dustry.
Also expected at today's meeting is Mr Ivan Bradbury, chairman of
Interconnection Systems, a manufacturer of printed-circuit boards based in
South Shields, near Newcastle upon Tyne.
Mr Bradbury said the extent businesses suffered from a downturn depended on
their efforts to step up sales - particularly in overseas markets. Two years
ago, he said, his company gained only 10 per cent of its sales from exports
 -now 50 per cent of annual sales of about Pounds 40m are from overseas.
'You have to make your own green shoots,' he said.
Mr Bradbury was not invited to either of the panel's two previous gatherings
in June and September.
The Treasury has added him to the panel because it thinks his knowledge of
the electronics industry andexport markets might be useful.
Another panel representative is Mr John Duff, strategy and business
development director at the UK subsidiary of IBM, the international computer
company.
Mr Duff was picked because of his role at IBM in taking charge of market
research into the UK information technology industry.
Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, will chair the meeting.
Other Treasury officials taking part include Mr Colin Mowl, chief
forecaster.
The economic prospects group - along with the panel of specialist
forecasters, whose first meeting is early next year - is part of a broad
effort by the Treasury to develop a more open approach to policymaking in
the wake of a number of recent setbacks, including sterling's exit from the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Richard Freeman, chief economist, ICI
Ex-Treasury economist, he also worked at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development. Plays important role inside ICI in gathering
information about world economic trends and relating them to the broad span
of business of the UK's largest manufacturing company. Sees 'fairly flat'
outlook for demand over months. Gets on well with Treasury chief economic
adviser Alan Budd.
Kevin Mahoney, managing director, Caradon Everest double-glazing company
In his fourth year as head of Everest, which is part of the MB-Caradon
building products group and sells double glazing mainly to domestic sector.
Did degree in politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford and worked for 15
years in office-equipment industry. Says 3-percentage-point cuts in interest
rates in recent months have yet to push up consumer demand, and confidence
still low.
Kate Barker, chief European economist, Ford
A former investment analyst in the City with the Postel investment group,
Barker is another relative pessimist about how the UK economy will turn out
next year. 'It's clear that the German economy is weakening and I'm afraid
that will have an impact on the rest of Europe,' she says. Before working at
Ford, Barker had the job of monitoring European economic trends at
London-based National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
Peter Davies, chief economist, BP
Joined BP in 1985 after six years as an economist in London office of Chase
Manhattan, the US bank. He also worked in Washington for World Bank and in
Swaziland's Ministry of Finance. A relative optimist about the UK outlook,
mainly because of what he sees as the strength of the North Sea energy
sector. He has two degrees in economics from Warwick University and the
London School of Economics.
Philip Crowson, chief economist, RTZ
After a 10-year stint in the chemicals industry, he has held his current job
in the world's biggest mining company for 12 years. He is fairly gloomy
about the outlook for next year, on the ground that even if demand in the UK
improves, the economies of many of its important trading partners appear
likely to be extremely weak. He says: 'If the world was a hospital ward, it
would be full of a lot of sick patients.'
Graham Burgess, chief planner, tobacco arm of BAT
Remains unashamedly hopeful about the economy next year - he says he is 'one
of the exceptions' in industry who firmly believes that the economy is
turning for the better. He thinks that the upturn in output and demand when
it comes could be relatively strong, leading to possible difficulties over
inflation. He has spent 13 years at the BAT industrial group - before that
he worked as a CBI economist.
Leslie Gunde, chief economist, GKN automotive and components group
Highly cautious about predicting a recovery - but says there are some
hopeful signs about rising demand from recent economic indicators, such as
the slight increase in retail sales volumes. Cheered also by signs that the
US recovery may be strengthening. Before joining GKN he worked as a CBI
economist and in the electronics and finance industries.
Barry Scott, head of economics and energy policy, British Gas
Far from bullish about prospects for increased output next year, he believes
the economy has yet to show much reaction to the growth measures announced
by the Treasury in last month's Autumn Statement. He thinks the recent cuts
in interest rates 'will eventually have a big impact' in getting the economy
moving. He has spent 15 years at British Gas - before that he was an
accountant and statistician.
David Coates, chief economic adviser, Department of Trade and Industry
On the panel to ensure the DTI does not feel left out of the picture as the
Treasury steps up efforts to form links with industry. Now at deputy
secretary level at the department. His past responsibilities have included
shipbuilding, regional policy and general industry support schemes. His
civil Service career goes back to 1968, when he joined the Ministry of
Technology as an economist.
Sudhir Junankar, deputy economics director,
Confederation of British Industry
He started his career as a specialist in energy economics and has worked at
CBI for five years. His main activity is in turning information from the
organisation's monthly survey of industrial trends into a plausible view of
the economic outlook. He says he is 'more hopeful' about the economy than he
has been for some time, and believes demand is 'close to an upturn'.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Shephard to scrap funding for union ballots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday removed a further plank of state support from trade
unionism and collective bargaining by announcing the phased withdrawal of
financial aid for secret ballots and trade union training.
The sums of money are not large - unions received Pounds 4m last year for
ballots and Pounds 2m for training - but the announcement is a further blow
to union hopes of opening a dialogue with the government and re-establishing
some national influence.
Yesterday Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, justified the
withdrawal of public subsidy for ballots by saying: 'Fewer than 50 per cent
of employees have their pay determined, directly or indirectly, by
negotiations between employers and trade unions.'
The government will meet 75 per cent of the cost of ballots in 1993-94, 50
per cent in 1994-95, 25 per cent in 1995-96. There will then be no further
payments.
Funding for secret ballots, introduced in 1980, was initially rejected by
the Trades Union Congress, but last night Mr Norman Willis, TUC general
secretary, described the move as 'a vicious and calculated blow to destroy
state support for good union practice'.
Mrs Shephard has spoken of the 'war' with the unions being at an end, but
the government has continued taking the axe to union-supported institutions
such as the National Economic Development Council.
The employment bill, currently at committee stage in the Commons and likely
to become law early next year, continues that policy. The bill proposes to
abolish Wages Councils, which set minimum wages for 2.5m workers, and to
abolish the duty of Acas, the government conciliation service, to encourage
the extension of collective bargaining.
Yesterday the clause in the bill that requires employees to agree every
three years to the automatic deduction of union subscriptions from their pay
packets was passed by 13 votes to 12. The unions fear that reform to
'check-off' might cause the loss of as many as 20 per cent of members and
lead to further financial pressure on unions.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Consumer retail spending stays steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL spending during the run-up to Christmas is showing more stability
than last year, according to Transax, the Birmingham-based cheque guarantee
organisation.
Last Saturday, retailers requested Transax to guarantee more than 27,400
personal cheques - 0.5 per cent more than the previous Saturday. In the
corresponding two Saturdays last year, there was a decline of 6.6 per cent
in the number of cheque guarantee requests, with trading picking up only in
the last weekend before Christmas, Transax reported.
The fact that cheque payments in shops have not fallen away this year offers
a further indication that consumer confidence may be slowly reviving. It
follows official figures this week showing a slight increase in the amount
of net consumer debt during October.
Transax provides a cheque guarantee service to about 23,000 shops and
stores.
Retailers, offered a cheque by a customer for a sum greater than that
specified on the cheque card, seek authorisation to accept it from Transax.
Once Transax gives that authorisation, it guarantees full payment to the
retailer even if the cheque bounces.
The volume of calls from retailers over the last two Saturdays suggested
that, in comparison with last year, trade has been higher in jewellery
stores, off-linences and wine merchants.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Directors who flout safety law face ban, HSE warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS CHIEFS who flout health and safety law may be banned from being
company directors and face heavy fines, the Health and Safety Executive said
yesterday.
Lewes Crown Court, sitting at Hove, recently clarified its unprecedented use
of powers under the 1986 Company Directors Disqualification Act.
The court disqualified Mr Rodney Chapman, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, from
being a company director for two years and fined him Pounds 5,000 in a
prosecution brought by the executive earlier this year. His company was also
fined Pounds 5,000 and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 3,553. The court
clarified the ban at a second hearing in October. It is the first time a
director has been banned under this act for breaching health and safety law.
In 1990 a prohibition notice was served on Chapman Chalk Supplies, of
Jevington, East Sussex. The executive said that a site run by the company
was dangerous because of falling rock where employees were working.
Mr David Eves, theexecutive's deputy director-general, said: 'It's another
weapon in our armoury.'
The Health and Safety Commission's annual report, published yesterday, shows
that accidents and ill health at work are costing employers up to Pounds 9bn
a year. The report shows 466 deaths, 28,961 major injuries and 150,427 other
serious injuries provisionally recorded, compared with the previous year's
final totals of 538; 30,684; and 158,000. The 1991-92 final figures are
expected to be nearer the 1990-91 totals.
Sir John Cullen, HSC chairman, said yesterday that health and safety
enforcement on the railway post-privatisation would be more expensive. He
said the commission would 'need to put in the resources and the people' to
protect safety standards on a 'fragmented' rail network.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont firm on his place at
Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont sought yesterday to quash suggestions that Mr John Major
might decide to move him from the Treasury in a new year reshuffle. The
chancellor insisted that he would be delivering the next Budget in March.
But the prime minister pointedly declined to rule out entirely the
possibility of changes at the top of his government. While senior aides said
that he had given 'no thought' to the issue, Mr Major would say only that he
refused to be drawn into a reshuffle speculation.
In a series of television interviews on the eve of the European Community
summit in Edinburgh, the prime minister said: 'I will deal with reshuffles
as and when we come to them.'
Aides believe that Mr Major is unlikely to move Mr Lamont before the Budget,
in spite of a growing view among cabinet colleagues that the chancellor no
longer commands the confidence of most Conservative MPs. By refusing to rule
out explicitly such a change, the prime minister is keeping his options
open.
Mr Lamont's comments were seen by Conservative colleagues as a veiled threat
to Mr Major that he is ready to quit the government rather than accept
another cabinet post if the prime minister seeks to move him. Mr Lamont -
one of the handful of Euro-sceptics in the cabinet - has the support of many
of the rightwing MPs on whom Mr Major must depend to secure ratification of
the Maastricht treaty.
Pressed during a television interview about persistent rumours of a new year
reshuffle, Mr Lamont responded: 'I am here as chancellor and I will be
delivering the Budget.'
He acknowledged that such a decision was a 'matter for the prime minister',
but then repeated that he would not be moved before March.
Cabinet colleagues judge that Mr Kenneth Clarke is the strongest candidate
to replace Mr Lamont at the Treasury. But the home secretary's strongly
pro-European views would enrage the Euro-sceptics, suggesting that his
chances for the job would be improved if a reshuffle is delayed until after
the Commons completes ratification of Maastricht in the summer.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to revamp strategy for
by-election campaigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party is preparing to sharpen its by-election campaigning
as part of the shake-up in the party organisation begun by Sir Norman
Fowler, the party chairman.
One key element in the changes will be a move to send a senior party figure
to a constituency immediately the need for a by-election arises, to advise
local party officers about the intense media pressure of the campaign so
they can take account of that in choosing a candidate.
Contacts between the local campaign and party headquarters at Smith Square
in London will also be improved. The most likely course is that a national
party officer or experienced MP will be seconded to the campaign, in
addition to the 'minder' that every by-election candidate has under present
arrangements.
Concern over the party's dismal performance in by-elections during the last
parliament has intensified because of the government's overall Commons
majority of just 21. In the last parliament, the government held just three
of the 10 seats it sought to defend, although it won them all back at the
April general election.
The changes in the party organisation are expected to include a swathe of
job losses as the party makes progress in reducing its Pounds 15m deficit.
While final decisions are not expected until the new year, the party's area
offices, which at present employ about 60 staff, are likely to bear the
brunt.
Streamlining the 12 area offices might mean that some are amalgamated,
although party figures emphasise that they think areas with distinct
identities, such as Wales and the south-west, should still be able to mount
their own operations.
The Scottish organisation is thus unlikely to be seriously affected.
In an effort to improve the effectiveness of local campaigning, party
officials are also considering 'twinning' safe Tory seats with marginals
where the constituencies are next to each other.
The party is already planning a more co-ordinated effort in the elections to
the European parliament. In particular, senior officers are already clear
that Mr John Major must play a more active part than Baroness Thatcher did
in the campaign for the 1989 Euro-elections.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Unease grows on future of monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY MPs' fears over the constitutional uncertainty created by the
separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales erupted publicly yesterday
with speculation that the royal couple would never become King and Queen,
Ralph Atkins writes.
Many Conservative MPs did not believe the princess should be Queen without a
reconciliation. Some suggested the prince may renounce the throne with his
son, 10-year-old Prince William, eventually succeeding the present Queen.
The government again said there were no constitutional implications of the
decision, which has brought fresh turmoil into the House of Windsor.
Downing Street is deliberately refusing to consider 'hypothetical' scenarios
 -for instance, if the couple were to divorce. That would make it difficult
for Prince Charles to take over the monarch's role as head of the Church of
England.
Privately, cabinet ministers said it was largely up to Buckingham Palace -
rather than MPs - to ensure that the arrangements were workable. Mr John
Major has said there is 'no reason' why the princess should not in due
course become Queen.
The couple will carry out some public engagements together but it was
unclear what would happen, however, if they wanted to start a relationship
with a different partner.
Nor is it certain how a modern monarch, under the scrutiny of the press,
could have a Queen from whom he was formally separated.
Mr John Bowis, Tory MP for Battersea, said: 'There has to be a coming
together or I'm afraid there has to be a skipping of a generation.
'It would be absurd to have two different carriage processions going from
two different parts of London to the coronation and then the King and Queen
going to their own homes afterwards.'
Dame Jill Knight, Tory MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said there was 'a
frisson of concern' in the Commons when Mr Major said the princess could
still become Queen.
'Many people say 'well, even if we skip the Prince and Princess of Wales, we
have another possible King in William'.' A great deal would also depend on
public reaction, Dame Jill said.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour urges City regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a 'very real trade-off' between the cost of financial services
regulation and the cost of compensation, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic
secretary to the Treasury, told MPs last night as he fended off Labour
charges of 'giving up on the fight to put City regulation in order'.
Many would be content to pay more for regulation if they thought that was
likely to have an impact on compensation costs, he suggested. Even the best
system of supervision would be wasted without the right people and the
willingness to exercise it.
As the Commons approved regulations to implement the second European banking
directive, he reiterated his comments to the Financial Times last week that
there was much that could be done to beef up financial services supervision
without resorting to new legislation.
'The City wanted self-regulation, it has got a high degree of
self-regulation, it must now self-regulate,' he said.
He was responding to a call from Mr Alistair Darling, shadow Treasury
spokesman, to 'set up a regulatory system with teeth' that would be good for
the consumer, efficient for industry and vital for the good name of the
City.
Prompted by Mr Darling, Mr Nelson admitted that the government would have
liked the recently agreed European investment services directive to have
come into force at the same time as the banking directive in January -
rather than in 1996, as currently planned.
He described the scheduled timetable for implementation as 'realistic'.
Addressing last night's directive, which provides the legal framework for a
single market in banking, Mr Nelson said the BCCI affair had demonstrated
the difficulties faced by supervisors in dealing with complex international
conglomerates.
But he argued that the measure's underlying supervisory principles remained
'valid in a post-BCCI world'. Those principles 'in many respects' were part
of the process of ensuring that a bank could not in future develop as BCCI
did.
That view was 'echoed' in the conclusions of the recent Bingham report.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE campaign for a change to the law on Sunday trading moved up a gear
yesterday as Mr Ray Powell, Labour MP for Ogmore, used a Westminster press
conference to underline the cross-party support for his proposals for
reform, Alison Smith writes.
His backbench bill, which would allow only certain types of shops to open on
Sunday, including garden centres, newsagents, chemists and petrol stations,
and would require shops to register with local authorities, will be debated
by MPs on 22 January. That is in addition to the separate commitment from
the government to provide MPs with an opportunity to discuss the options
before government legislation is introduced, possibly later this session.
Yesterday Mr Powell's proposal was endorsed by Mr Michael Schluter, director
of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, who called it 'practical, feasible and
enforceable', and by Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary of Usdaw, the
shopworkers' union.

A BILL designed to protect National Health Service staff who speak out on

US President-elect Mr Bill Clinton is 'looking forward very much' to meeting
the prime minister after his inauguration next month, Mr Tony Newton, leader
of the Commons, said yesterday.
He spoke at question time of 'friendly exchanges' between Mr Clinton and
Britain's ambassador to the US, Sir Robin Renwick.
Labour MP Mr Tony Banks raised concerns for relations between the
governments in light of the co-operation between the Conservative party and
President George Bush's campaign team, together with the checking of Home
Office files relating to Mr Clinton. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary,
later denied any 'improper use' of his department.
Mr Clinton will not meet Mr Major on his visit to Washington this month, but
both sides have insisted the President-elect would not be seeing any foreign
leaders at this stage.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Toyota to buy Pounds 100m of British parts a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, JAPAN'S biggest car maker, which has a factory near Derby going on
stream next week, said yesterday it plans to spend Pounds 100m a year with
parts suppliers in the area.
The company said it would spend that amount with suppliers within a 50-mile
radius of the plant as soon as output reaches 100,000 cars a year.
The extent of the planned boost to the local economy surrounding the Pounds
700m facility at Burnaston was disclosed as the identity of some of the key
UK and continental European component suppliers to the venture became known.
Engines from its Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside, north Wales, are
already on stream.
Toyota has been reluctant to name its principal suppliers, partly because of
the long and complex process involved in setting up its intended long-term
relationships with the key companies.
Of a total of 160 UK and continental Europe-based suppliers, about half are
in the UK.
The most prominent among those, it is now known, are British Steel (raw
steel supplies), PPG 123 and IDAC (paint), Lucas Industries (electrical
components), GKN, Albion Pressed Metal and Camford Engineering (pressings
and welded assemblies, and additionally GKN for drive train components),
Birkbys Plastics and Plastic Omnium (plastic parts), Rockwell Golde
(sunroofs), Tenneco Walker (exhausts), Triplex (glass) and Pirelli and
Dunlop (tyres).
The components are destined for the Carina E, the upper-medium saloon model
that Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) will build at Burnaston and for which
there is a target of 60 per cent 'local' - European - content by mid 1993.
Toyota intends to lift local content to 80 per cent by mid 1995 as more
parts currently under development by UK and continental suppliers are
substituted for Japanese supplies.
Mr Bryan Jackson, Toyota UK's director of corporate affairs and human
resources, said no increase in the number of European suppliers would be
involved in reaching the higher European content.
Output is expected to reach 100,000 a year in 1994, rising to 200,000 in the
late 1990s.
Mr Jackson said Toyota was satisfied with its own experience of the UK and
continental European components industry in spite of a recent study led by
Cardiff Business School that indicated an alarming quality and productivity
gap between Japanese and UK motor component suppliers.
He said: 'The European supply base is, in fact, very strong and they've
shown us that they're dedicated to getting the quality right.
'We're not hiding the fact that at the moment cost levels are higher than in
Japan - but our production volumes at the start are sufficiently low that we
had anticipated that and we're working with them to get their cost base
down.'

FT  11 DEC 92 / Ridley speaks out on arms controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD RIDLEY broke his silence on government involvement in the arms trade
yesterday, claiming it was 'easy' for manufacturers to circumvent official
controls if they wanted to do so.
In an article in The Spectator magazine, the former trade and industry
secretary advises Lord Justice Scott in his inquiry into the arms-to-Iraq
affair to consider the facts 'against the background of the true nature of
commercial trading in armaments or oil'.
He emphasises, however, that he could not 'write about the arms-to-Iraq row
in advance of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry'.
Arguing that it would be 'crazy' to put unnecessary impediments in the way
of British exporters, Lord Ridley says manufacturers are 'by no means under
the government's control'. He adds: 'Manufacturers only need an export
licence if they think they might be supplying armaments to a country against
which the government has placed an arms embargo. If an arms manufacturer
wants to do so, it is easy to beat the control.'
On dual-use equipment, he says that requiring an export licence from anyone
who 'thinks he might have an order for something that could be of use in
waging war' leads to 'impossible judgments' having to be made. 'Nor does it
seem unreasonable to 'relax the guidelines' at some times and to tighten
them at others.'
Previously confidential documents released during the trial of three
directors of Matrix Churchill, the machine tool manufacturer, included a
letter sent in June 1990 to the prime minister from Mr Ridley's office
calling for the rationale of government guidelines for defence sales to Iraq
and Iran to be reconsidered.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Coal fumes over bill of health for gas: The Littlechild
report's likely impact on the government's strategy for energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild touched a sensitive spot in the energy debate
yesterday, judging by the noisy reaction to his report on the 'dash for
gas'.
Stripped of its technical language, the 50-page report dismisses one of the
central arguments put forward by supporters of the coal industry - that gas
has been unfairly squeezing coal out of the electricity generation market.
His analysis will make it much harder for the government to justify curbing
the growth of gas as it seeks ways of averting further pit closures.
To compile his report, Prof Littlechild examined dozens of contracts for the
sale of electricity produced from a variety of fuels - coal, gas and
nuclear. His conclusion is clear. The contracts that regional electricity
companies have signed with power generators for gas-based electricity are
not uneconomic.
Prof Littlechild says they should be welcomed as they add diversity to fuel
supplies, and bring environmental benefits. He goes further, and maintains
that gas-based electricity is the cheapest on the market and distribution
companies are right to sign up for it. While admitting that comparing prices
is difficult, he places electricity from coal at 3.2p per kilowatt hour,
nuclear power at 3p, and gas in the range of 2.7p to 3p.
Altogether, it is a much clearer and stronger conclusion than anyone
expected. That accounts for the furious reaction from the coal lobby.
The main objection from the power generators was that Prof Littlechild had
used wrong assumptions about the extent to which generation capacity is
used. His prices were based on average use of 53 per cent, while many power
stations operate up to 90 per cent of the time. The longer they run, the
cheaper their costs.
'He's comparing chalk and cheese,' National Power said.
There are, however, nuances to the report that coal may find more
encouraging. One of Prof Littlechild's findings is that there is still a
large hole in the energy market in the mid 1990s that could be filled, at
least in part by coal.
He added up all the long-term supply contracts and matched them against the
electricity companies' forecast needs. That showed that in 1995 as much as
35 per cent of the market will remain uncontracted for. The hole, by Offer's
estimates, is the equivalent of 25m tons of coal.
Although other fuel sources will fill part of it, it shows the market is far
from closed. Gas occupies a smaller part of the market than generally
believed - only one sixth.
Prof Littlechild raised the possibility that while gas contracts may be the
cheapest, they may not accurately reflect the true cost of generation. He
has no evidence of this but intends to investigate further. That is worrying
for the gas industry - many electricity distributors have equity interests
in gas generation projects.
The report has a sting in the tail. Prof Littlechild wonders whether power
generators are overcharging for coal-based power in the new round of
contracts they are negotiating with distributors. Although that is
consistent with Prof Littlechild's concerns that the generators dominate the
electricity market, it implies that coal-based power might be sold more
cheaply, benefitting the coal industry.
'Can the price of coal be brought down? Is there scope for reduction in the
generators' margins?' he asked yesterday, implying that the answer to both
questions was yes.
His questions sent tremors through distributors because they could be
interpreted as implying that a company which signed up for the new coal
contracts might be in breach of its licence obligation to buy electricity as
economically as possible. That might further damage efforts to get long-term
coal contracts in place. Prof Littlechild sought to soothe those fears by
saying he would not stand in the way of short-term deals that enable the
market to function.
The question in the wake of the report is its impact on Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade secretary, as he formulates a new policy for coal.
Prof Littlechild's report reflects the views of an independent regulator.
However, its task is not to address the political issues that might have a
decisive influence in shaping policy, and the report could equally be
brushed aside if Mr Heseltine decided that halting the dash for gas was the
best way of preserving miners' jobs.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Nissan UK reaches pay and employment deal with Sunderland
and Cranfield staff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN UK, the Japanese car company, has reached a two-year pay and
employment deal with the 5,000 staff at its north-east England plant at
Sunderland and its engineering centre at Cranfield, Bedfordshire.
The deal is the first significant private-sector pay rise agreed since the
government announced a 1.5 per cent pay ceiling for the public sector. The
award, effective from January, will raise salaries by 4 per cent in the
first year and 3.5 per cent in the second.
If UK inflation rises above 4.5 per cent in 1994 salaries will rise on a
point-for-point basis thereafter. That means that if UK inflation rises to
5.5 per cent in 1994, then salaries will rise an extra 1 percentage point to
4.5 per cent. In the previous two years the award was 10.5 per cent falling
to 7 per cent in the second year.
The deal compares with a two-year deal at Jaguar that gave workers 4 per
cent in both years with an inflation trigger in the second.
Employees at Rover had an 18-month deal worth a minimum of 7.3 per cent.
Ford is in the second year of a two-year deal. Peugeot Talbot has still to
settle.
The deal at Nissan UK will give manufacturing staff a basic wage of Pounds
15,382.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Bombs injure 10 people at N London shopping centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN PEOPLE were injured yesterday by two bombs that exploded in a north
London shopping centre.
The small devices went off at Wood Green Shopping City at 9.30am and 9.35am
as police and shop staff were evacuating the area. They were planted in
rubbish bins, 50 yards apart, outside branches of Argos and WH Smith.
Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said:
'I have no doubt this is the latest in the mainland campaign by the IRA.'
The attack followed an explosion on Wednesday night in a car parked near the
Woodside Park Underground station, also in north London. No one was injured.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, commenting yesterday on the explosions,
said: 'It is vitally important that people remain vigilant in the period up
to Christmas.'
Mr Major, who was speaking in Edinburgh on his arrival for the EC summit,
said a great deal had been done to improve security across the UK.
The Wood Green blasts, which caused limited damage to shops, were preceded
by warning calls that the police described as a deliberately misleading trap
for officers clearing the area. Scotland Yard said that three warning calls
were made at 9.15am, 9.16am and 9.18am. The first call, using an IRA code
word, was made to a news agency and said the bomb would explode in 20
minutes.
The injured, four police officers and six members of the public, were taken
to North Middlesex Hospital suffering from shock and cuts.
The Association of London Authorities last night called on the home
secretary to meet the costs of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism
operations.
Mr Derek Sawyer, association policing spokesman, said London taxpayers
should not have to meet the full cost of tackling the IRA's latest campaign.
Mr Sawyer said: 'It is important that the Home Office recognises the amount
of extra police time and resources which the spate of terrorist incidents
requires and provides the Met with extra money to cope with these extra
responsibilities.'
He said a meeting with police had disclosed that the police overtime budget
was expected to rise by more than 7 per cent next year, after having fallen
for several years.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Call for training system reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE training system was yesterday condemned as a formula for national
decline. Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics made the
accusation as he called for an urgent training reform act.
Professor Layard, director of the economic and social research council's
centre for economic performance at the LSE, was delivering the council's
third annual lecture in London.
Two thirds of British workers, Professor Layard said, had no vocational or
professional qualification, compared with only a quarter in Germany.
He said: 'Britain has a Lumpenproletariat un-like any other advanced nation,
and this shows not only in British factories but on football terraces around
the world.'
The priority should be the expansion of part-time education so that those at
the lowest end of the skills spectrum could get a national vocational
qualification (NVQ), at least at level two.
'If expanding full-time education is the top priority, Britain will
conti-nue to produce a Lumpen-proletariat,' Professor Layard said.
The main elements of his proposed changes to training - elements of which if
adopted would add Pounds 2bn to government's expenditure on education and
training - were:
All the off-the-job vocational education and training leading to NVQs should
be paid for by public funds, whether provided by public or private training
institu-tions.
All young people aged under 19 should be employed on a traineeship basis
with clear obligations on the employer and appropriate levels of pay.
No employer to employ anyone under 19 without ensuring they received at
least one day a week off-the-job training.
The introduction of external accreditation for NVQs.

TALKS at the Department of Transport yesterday failed to resolve an impasse
over the funding of the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express project, but further
meetings are planned, Richard Tomkins writes.
Plans for the 16-mile rail link between Heathrow airport and central London
are threatened by a dispute between British Rail and BAA, the airports
group. BAA says that British Rail is asking too high a price for the use of
its tracks into Paddington station. British Rail says the line will boost
BAA's profits at Heathrow and the company should be prepared to subsidise
it.
One observer said the talks had given rise to cautious optimism that a
solution could be found.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Ministers rapped by Labour on homeless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party last night attacked as 'complacent' the government response
to figures showing that the numbers of homeless families in temporary
accommodation have reached record levels.
Environment Department statistics released yesterday showed that the number
of homeless families living in temporary accommodation in September was
65,230. That was 8 per cent up on the previous year and a new record,
continuing the steep rise from the 1980 figure of 4,170.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, commented on the figures by
describing as 'most encouraging' the fall in the number temporarily housed
in bed-and-breakfast accommodation - down from 13,550 in September 1991 to
10,390 this year. He said that reflected the success of government
initiatives.
Sir George also welcomed the small decline in the number becoming homeless,
which fell to 35,520 in the third quarter of 1991 from 36,380 in the same
quarter of 1991. The proportion made homeless because of mortgage arrears
fell from 12 per cent in last year to 9 per cent this year.
Mr John Battle, opposition housing spokesman, said that the minister's
response was 'riddled with complacency'. He said: 'In the past year alone,
almost 100 families a week have been added to the growing number of people
in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, hostels and other overcrowded
accommodation.'
At Westminster, Mr Tony Newton, standing in for Mr John Major at prime
minister's question time, insisted that government measures had led to a
fall over the past year in the number of families described as homeless.
Mr Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, suggested that the houses of
parliament should be used during the Christmas recess as shelter for those
sleeping in the streets.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Accountancy firms fall short of standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY ACCOUNTANCY firms are failing to comply with the audit requirements
introduced last year, the first annual report of their self-regulatory body
shows.
Only 11 of the 158 audit firms so far randomly inspected passed all 13 tests
devised by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Joint Monitoring
Unit, the regulatory body jointly owned by the three UK chartered
accountancy bodies.
The findings come in a confidential internal report due to be sent today to
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for consideration by
officials before publication next week.
The report emphasises that most of the 10,200 registered firms have taken
steps to comply with the audit regime introduced in October 1991, and that
it is too soon to make a definitive statement on the quality of work carried
out.
The Joint Monitoring Unit unearthed widespread failures in the systems and
procedures that the regulations require. Its findings will fuel criticism of
the present quality of auditing.
The unit visited 291 firms in the 12 months to September - meeting its
targets - of which 143 were to prepare for registration, to offer training
or in response to requests.
Of the remainder, which were randomly selected during April to September, 67
firms were not conducting 'cold' or continuous reviews of their audit work
as required by the regulations.
The audit procedures of 39 were not subject to quality control procedures
and 41 had not planned their audits. The unit emphasised that the findings
might indicate inadequate documentation at least as much as unsatisfactory
audits.
It also judged 10 firms not to be independent from their audit clients, and
identified nine that were not competent. The professional accountancy bodies
have refused to register at least 12 firms or practitioners as auditors, and
have so far withdrawn registration from 10. They received more than 183
complaints during the year.
The report concludes: 'The weaknesses thus far identified do not appear to
indicate any general shortfall in the quality of audit work but do
demonstrate in many cases procedural shortfalls.'
It recommends making audit regulation more economical and more rapid in the
future, and says that more meaningful ways of analysing data from monitoring
visits to firms need to be developed.
It says many firms believe that audit regulation was introduced in response
to a few prominent company collapses, and are concerned at the high cost of
the new regime.
Audit registration fees received from firms are expected to be about Pounds
4m this year, against expenditure on regulation and the Auditing Practices
Board of Pounds 3.6m this year and Pounds 3.5m in the previous three years.

investors - including the Dutch airport Schiphol, and the Mexican Grupo
Industrial Hakim - are interested in bidding, according to the report.
Mexico's airports are expected to handle 25m passengers this year, of whom
10m will be international travellers. Of the 61 airports, around 12 are
responsible for 90 per cent of the passengers. The government's aim is to
use these generally profitable airports to attract private investors to
manage the smaller, often loss-making ones.
The airport privatisations are part of an ambitious programme to hand over
responsibility for investing in Mexico's transport infrastructure to the
private sector. The government has awarded concessions to the private sector
to build around 3,500km of toll roads, and passed laws to encourage the
private sector to invest in the water system.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Senate passed a law which will facilitate
private-sector investment in the electricity sector. The law will enable
private concerns to build and own electricity plants, but they will have to
sell electricity to the state-owned Commission of Federal Electricity.
Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Mexico's state oil company, has appointed JP
Morgan, US investment bank, to advise it in privatising some of its
secondary petrochemical plants. JP Morgan will advise Pemex on the valuation
of the plants, the structure and promotion of the sales.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Go-ahead given for new taxes in Brazil

THE Brazilian government has won its first round in the battle to introduce
a long-awaited fiscal reform, with the approval by a congressional
commission of a project to bring in new taxes.
After a month of negotiations over a government proposal, the all-party
commission finally reached consensus late on Wednesday night on introducing
new taxes on financial transactions (including 0.25 per cent on all
cheques), corporate assets and fuel, to raise an estimated Dollars 9.5bn
(Pounds 6.3bn). They also agreed on setting up special tribunals and lifting
banking secrecy for suspected tax evaders. The project allows for state
companies to be declared bankrupt.
The reform is crucial to help cover a Dollars 13bn hole in next year's
budget and allow re-establishment of talks with the International Monetary
Fund over a new accord. Tax revenues have fallen 25 per cent in real terms
over the past two years and evasion this year is estimated at Dollars 35bn.
The project must now go to Congress, where it needs to be approved by votes
in the lower and upper houses. Mr Roberto Freire, leader of the government
in Congress, said yesterday: 'The commission's approval gives us the
conditions to find a consensus in Congress.'
The financial markets reacted positively to the news, with the main Sao
Paulo index closing 2.7 per cent higher.
Meanwhile, the Brazilian Senate commission on foreign debt yesterday
approved the text of a Dollars 44bn (Pounds 28.9bn) debt agreement with
commercial creditors.
Approval of the agreement, reached in July and finalised in September, had
been held up by the ousting of President Fernando Collor and objections to
the text by left-wing senators. Delays caused the price of Brazilian debt on
the secondary markets to fall to less than 27 cents this week.
The 27-member commission voted by an absolute majority to approve the text,
although four senators recommended a delay for further studies on Brazil's
capacity to pay. It goes to the plenary for approval.
Senator Jose Fogaca, rapporteur of the commission, said: 'Today's vote. . is
an important step towards Brazil's full re-entry into the international
financial community and should encourage new flows of foreign capital.'
However, a New York-based debt trader said he did not expect the price to
rise much 'because of the general lack of good news out of Brazil'.
There is considerable doubt over the future of the agreement. The new
economic team cancelled talks with the International Monetary Fund over the
Dollars 2.1bn accord signed in January, which has lapsed because of the
country's failure to meet targets.

SENATOR Bob Packwood, the veteran Republican from Oregon, yesterday said he
intended to stay on in the Senate in spite of charges that he had engaged in
a pattern of sexual harassment towards women for 20 years.
He refused to discuss any of the dozen and more incidents of which he has
been accused. But he apologised for behaviour which he said 'was not just
inappropriate or boorish, but just plain wrong'.
Mr Packwood conceded that 'the bonds of trust' linking him and the people of
Oregon had been badly strained. He was narrowly returned for a new six-year
term last month before the Washington Post published an article detailing
the charges against him. He pledged to rebuild that trust and said that his
actions had been 'out of synch' with a long political career in which he had
consistently practised 'gender neutral' policies.
His determination to stay in office may yet be tested further. The Senate
ethics committee is to hold hearings in the New Year on his case, which has
attracted wide public attention. In addition, Oregon has liberal recall
statutes, which could lead to him facing a special election.
Two other senators, Mr David Durenberger from Minnesota and Mr Daniel Inouye
from Hawaii, have also faced recent allegations of sexual harassment.
Some women's groups have demanded that Mr Packwood stand down.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Peru army teams up with locals to beat guerrillas: A
campaign that reaches deep into the jungle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ARE at war, reads the not-so-welcoming sign over the sand-bagged hut at
the edge of Puerto Bermudez's dirt-red airstrip. 'It is everybody's war and
united we shall overcome.'
Here, in Peru's central jungle, unity means alliance between the Pichis
valley's largely native Indian population, the Ashaninkas, and the Peruvian
army. When their chief was captured and subsequently executed by the MRTA
(Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement) in late 1989, Ashaninkas rose up
against the guerrillas, taking bloody reprisals against any natives or
settlers believed to be collaborators.
Now the Ashaninkas, like civilians all over Peru, are being forced to make
definitive choices in the counter-subversion war. Throughout the country's
extensive 'emergency zones', the army is recruiting ordinary Peruvians for
'rondas' or civil defence patrols which serve as a supplementary army under
direct military command. Those who refuse are inevitably suspected of
subversive sympathies.
The Fujimori government is finding itself obliged to compensate in manpower
for its desperately inadequate counter-subversive equipment and munitions. A
long-critical situation has been exacerbated by swingeing post-coup cuts in
US financial assistance to Peruvian anti-narcotics police and military
operations.
In the central jungle, where one aged Russian M-17 helicopter serves as the
sole troop support, the warlike Ashaninkas look to be the answer to the
under-funded military's prayer. The Pichis valley standing army now
comprises 500 professional Ashaninka soldiers plus 5,000 more trained
reservists. Nine control posts along the 50 miles of semi-tropical valley
exert rigorous documents checks and vehicle searches. Ashaninka 'vigilantes'
wear T-shirts declaring 'anti-subversive commando' and work alongside the
small official military detachment.
Apart from some three dozen relatively modern firearms, however, most of
these Ashaninka soldiers are armed only with their traditional hunting
weapons, bow and arrow. With these, they are deadly accurate at up to 30
yards - and army commanders in the zone say arrows are superior for
short-range combat in scrub undergrowth to the light automatic FALs or
Kalashnikovs favoured by the guerrillas.
But the implacable logic of employing a basically civilian population to
combat well-armed guerrillas recently took three Ashaninka leaders on a
first-ever visit to the capital to plead with armed forces' chiefs for more
sophisticated weaponry. 'We've proved our effectiveness against terrorists,'
says Ashaninka defence secretary 'Oscar', 'but now we need modern guns like
they have.'
Peru's Ashaninka population totals maybe 100,000 - estimates are, even by
Peruvian standards, unreliable. At least a quarter of these live in the
Pichis. They existed until three years ago as self-sufficient farmers, the
women cultivating cassava and maize and spinning locally-grown cotton into
rough but serviceable cloth while their menfolk hunted and fished.
Even though Peru's two main guerrilla groups, Sendero Luminoso and MRTA,
have suffered recent heavy blows, the Ashaninkas remain a target.
The pro-Cuban MRTA's recent strategy has focused on peacemaking.
Conciliatory bands stop vehicles on the road to Puerto Bermudez to give
'consciousness-raising' chats. The guerrillas' criticism of government
economic policy and advocacy of investment in local agro-industry is
generally well-received.
For Sendero Luminoso, the Ashaninkas have provided a valuable fighting
resource. In the past few years, Sendero columns have been entering native
communities in the central jungle demanding 'quotas' of youngsters as
recruits - refusal is punishable by death and, though fewer in number since
the capture of guerrilla leader Abimael Guzman, massacres still occur.
Some Ashaninkas are lured to join the guerrillas by promises of good pay or
guns - which rarely materialise. Their captors employ them as cannon-fodder,
and they fight with bow and arrow alone. Ashaninkas wives and children,
often press-ganged with their men, become the guerrillas' slaves, obliged to
forage and cook.
Joint operations in the central jungle involving Ashaninkas and government
counter-subversive troops are now commonplace. And the ensuing battles often
pit Ashaninkas against members of their own tribe. One special ops major
estimates that half the Sendero subversives his patrols encounter are
Ashaninkas.
The subversives make full use of their native collaborators' jungle lore, he
says - the area is pitted with man-traps, deep holes covered with leaves and
grass to conceal sharpened hardwood stakes smeared with excrement. Wounds,
if not fatal, quickly fester and many patrols must return to base, mission
unaccomplished, to seek medical help for unwary victims.
Now the Pichis valley looks set to gain further unwanted significance in the
internal Peruvian drugs-and-terrorism cycle. Coca growers are being squeezed
out of the Huallaga valley by escalating violence, stepped-up government
action against the illegal cocaine trade (the Peruvian air force has finally
taken control over nine provincial airports in the zone) and the mystery
fungus which has decimated crops around the traditional coca-trading
heartland of Uchiza. Hundreds are already bringing their knowledge and
coca-processing skills to the northern end of the Pichis valley.
If the Pichis, abandoned like so many other areas of Peru by a bankrupt
state, becomes a new cocaine-processing centre, then the Ashaninkas face the
unhappy prospect of continuing to serve as pawns in a power struggle which
has little relevance to their lives.

Guatemalan Indian leader Rigoberta Menchu, accepting the 1992 Nobel Peace

guerrilla war and eradicate human rights abuses, Reuter reports from Oslo.
Accepting the gold Nobel medal and a diploma at a ceremony at Oslo's City

against all indigenous peoples.
Talks between left-wing Guatemalan guerrillas and the government of
President Jorge Serrano on ending a 30-year war in which perhaps 100,000
people have been killed have been deadlocked for months.
Ms Menchu, a Maya Indian, said other countries should bring pressure for a
joint accord on human rights as a first step towards peace in her country.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY secretary Nicholas Brady, in a parting shot before the arrival
of a Democratic administration, has issued a white paper calling for a
radical overhaul of the US tax system.
His proposals include lifting the income tax threshold to remove more than
half of all individual taxpayers from the income tax net, and creating a
form of VAT on businesses.
Mr Brady also suggests radically simplifying the rules for business
taxpayers, reforming the taxation of multinationals and eliminating double
taxation of corporate profits distributed to shareholders.
In a speech at Columbia University Business School in New York, he said the
US tax system needed this radical treatment in order to remove its bias
against savings. 'Rather than continuing to rearrange the deck chairs on a
sinking ship, the keel of our tax system should be raised and completely
overhauled,' he said.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Asian growth to accelerate
</HEADLINE>

   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC growth in the world's fastest growing region, Asia's developing and
newly-industrialised countries (NICs), is set to accelerate from 6 per cent
this year to 7 per cent in 1993, says a forecast published yesterday by the
Institute of Developing Economies, a Japanese government-backed research
institute. The acceleration of growth follows a year in which the region's
economies, while slowing from the 7.3 per cent expansion of 1990, moved
forward largely on the basis of internally generated demand and investment.
Next year promises stronger growth because some governments in the region
are expected to ease monetary policy following a period when interest rates
were raised to combat inflation and deteriorating current account balances.
The forecasts are based on an econometric modelling of the four NICs  -
South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore  - and Asean members Malaysia,
Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.
Thailand is expected to post the highest rate of expansion next year, at 8.5
per cent, against an estimated 7.5 per cent this year, thanks to an increase
of public investment and a recovery in foreign direct investment. Malaysian
growth is expected to slow, from 8.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent, following the
expiry of an incentive scheme for foreign direct investment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE days of talks between Britain and China about Hong Kong's future ended
yesterday with the two sides still sharply divided on the issue of political
reform and having made no progress on other matters.
The deadlock between the two was underlined by China's insistence that the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) not issue a joint communique  - a
break with past practice - and by its reluctance to approve any agreements
with the UK concerning Hong Kong.
Explaining Beijing's position, Guo Fengmin, the leader of the Chinese side,
said: 'The basis of co-operation between the Chinese and British
government's has been severely undermined.'
He again called on the British government to withdraw Governor Chris
Patten's proposals for more democracy in the colony's 1995 elections. Only
then could co-operation be restored, Guo said.
Mr Tony Galsworthy, leader of the British team, said he had told the Chinese
side that Britain was willing, without preconditions, to discuss with China
the conduct of Hong Kong's 1995 elections.
'We do not insist that Mr Patten's proposals should form the sole basis of
such discussions: we are prepared to discuss any aspect of this subject
which the Chinese side wish and any ideas which they wish to put forward, as
well as any areas where they feel Mr Patten's proposals might be contrary to
the Basic Law.'
He made plain that this offer could be taken up by the Chinese at any level.
'I'm quite sure that Mr Patten and the British government would make every
effort to solve this impasse,' he said.
Mr Galsworthy said the atmosphere of the three-day meeting had been
generally courteous. The Chinese, however, displayed 'great rigidity' in
their position on the substance of matters and there was 'no progress to
speak of'.
The Hong Kong stock market continued to be unsettled by the tension. The
Hang Seng index fell 65.46 points, or 1.2 per cent, to close at 5,273.79.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Japan's downturn reaches the provinces: Charles Leadbeater
visits a quiet town caught in the fallout of the deflating bubble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE coastal scrubland of Uchinada-machi does not look worth Y3.8bn (Pounds
20m). Yet that is what Daikyo, the property developer, paid for the sand
hills overlooking the Japan Sea where it planned to build a dream resort
with a 28-storey hotel, apartment block, amusement arcades and shopping
malls.
The project, which the local government approved in the teeth of fierce
opposition from local environmentalists, was to have cost Y900bn.
This autumn Daikyo announced that the dream conceived in the years of
Japan's 'bubble' economy was being postponed for at least a year and a half.
Most local people believe the sand dunes near the city of Kanazawa will
remain no more than that.
The resort plan was the most striking example of how Kanazawa became partly
caught up in the bubble despite its deep-rooted conservatism. Now it is
starting to feel the impact of the bubble's deflation and the economic
downturn which has followed in its wake.
The spread of the downturn to the provinces is likely to be one of the main
themes of the Bank of Japan's influential quarterly report on the state of
the Japanese economy which is published today.
The report is likely to show that business confidence in the final quarter
of the year reached lows not seen since the recession caused by the first
oil shock almost a quarter of a century ago.
Kanazawa was on the fringes of the bubble. Land prices there rose by 29 per
cent in a year at their peak, compared with rises of more than 90 per cent
in the large cities. The town's quiet streets saw a few Mercedes Benz cars
with designer-clad drivers. Property developers arrived with plans for golf
courses.
Yet the bubble did not create the frenzy that it provoked in Tokyo. People
in Kanazawa regard the speculation of that era as an infection, as much due
to moral laxity as to ill-designed economic policies.
Mr Hiroshuke Hashiba, managing director of the Daiwa department store,
Kanazawa's largest, remarked: 'People got over confident. They thought
because we had a huge trade surplus we could do anything. They thought that
all this money gave them power, but actually it was just money going round
and round.'
At the prefectural government building in the centre of the city overlooking
an avenue of trees, Mr Yaichi Nakanishi, who has been the governor of the
Ishikawa prefecture for 30 years, said: 'There was too much money around and
people believed that whatever they produced would be sold because the
economy had always grown so fast they could sell whatever they made.'
Many in Kanazawa believe the bubble's collapse should mark a moral turning
point back towards the values of thrift, hard work and self-sacrifice which
most older people regard as the cultural roots of Japan's economic success.
Mr Ryozo Koshijima, the president of the local chamber of commerce,
ex-plained: 'We stick to our own business in this area without buying stocks
and shares or making a huge surplus for ourselves. The character-istics of
this area are hardworking, stable, calm people.'
However, in spite of this cultural inoculation against 'bubble values',
Kanazawa has not been able entirely to escape the economic consequences of
the bubble's deflation.
Local industry, which is based on machinery making, is being hit by cuts in
capital investment and exports. Domestic sales of Tsudakoma, the leading
international textile machinery maker, are 20 per cent down in the past few
months compared with the same period last year and exports fell by 15 per
cent with slowing demand from Asia and Europe.
According to Mr Shinsuke Taga, Tsudakoma's general manager, 'this downturn
is probably worse than previous recessions because we are facing slower
demand at home and abroad'.
The local Hokkoku bank's conservatism has stood it in good stead. Its
lending to property developers was limited. As a result it has one of the
strongest capital bases among Japan's banks.
Yet Mr Takeki Ataku, a senior executive, acknowledges that caution is making
it increasingly reluctant to lend to companies in trouble. There were 43
bankruptcies in the area in the third quarter, more than double the number
in the first three months of the year.
The local labour market is still very tight, with 146 job offers for every
100 job applicants, compared with a ratio of 80 to 100 in Tokyo. Yet in
spite of this the air of caution is spreading into the high street.
Mr Hashiba at the Daiwa store which dominates the centre of the town,
explained: 'People are becoming much more choosy, buying a shorter coat for
winter because it is cheaper, ankle boots instead of knee-length boots. They
are still spending but they are cutting back.'
Daiwa's sales growth is slowing and retail sales in the region fell for the
first time in September. Even the prefecture's tourist economy is being hit,
with visits to the region's top six hot springs resorts down by 10 per cent.
Kanazawa watched the rise and fall of the bubble economy as a financial
spectacle in the big cities which little concerned it. Its strength rests
upon its world class manufacturing companies such as Tsudakoma and Komatsu,
the construction equipment manufacturers.
In the wake of the bubble's deflation the gyrations of the stock market can
still provoke a sense of crisis in Tokyo. In Kanazawa there is quiet caution
as its economy shrinks with companies producing and investing less,
consumers spending and banks lending less.
Most business leaders are increasingly pessimistic. They do not expect
growth to return till the end of next year. Mr Koshijima explained: 'The
economy will probably not go down and down but it is probably going to stay
very flat for a long time.'

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA yesterday acted further to suppress riots which have swept the country
since Hindu militants stormed the Ayodhya mosque, though the death toll
continued to mount.
The government last night outlawed three Hindu groups - the militant
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS, or National Service Corps) and the Vishwa
Hindu Parishad (VHP, or World Hindu Council) as well as the nationalist
Bajrang Dal.
An official in Delhi said the ban followed their participation in Sunday's
attack. Two Moslem fundamentalist groups, Swayam Sevak and Jamait-e-Islami,
were also prohibited. All five were accused of 'promoting disharmony or
feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religions.'
The move follows a pledge by Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister, to place
a ban on religious militant activist groups. He has not yet indicated how he
plans to fulfil a second commitment, to rebuild the Ayodhya mosque.
Speaking before the bans were imposed, Mr Rao said reports indicated 'a
perceptible change for the better' in communal unrest. Mr Rao pledged that
the crisis would not derail the country's wide-ranging economic reform
programme.
'The speculations that the reforms are being shelved are absolutely
unfounded.'
Sunday's assault on the mosque in Ayodhya, northern India, took place during
a mass rally organised by the militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, the
main opposition party. Mr L K Advani and Mr M M Joshi, the two top BJP
leaders, who are under arrest for allegedly inciting religious conflict,
were yesterday remanded in custody for a week.
By late yesterday 950 people were reported to have been killed, according to
the Press Trust of India, up from 760 on Wednesday.
Reports from Bombay, the country's commercial capital and scene of the worst
violence earlier this week, indicated the authorities had managed to
reimpose order in many districts, though sporadic street fights continued.
In Calcutta, however, the army was called in for the first time, to take
control of six of the city's 35 police districts.

<TEXT>
Australia's unemployment rate worsened yet again in November, rising 0.1 per
cent to a new post-1930s record of 11.4 per cent, accentuating the depth of
the country's economic recession, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed the total number of people in
work fell from 7.71m to 7.64m.
Mr Kim Beazley, the federal employment minister, said economic growth of at
least 3 per cent was needed to begin to cut the unemployment rate. Last
month the Australian government shuffled spending programmes already
announced for the next 18 months, adding about ADollars 182m (Pounds 82m) to
job creation schemes.
The unemployment burden was spread unevenly across Australia's states, with
the biggest growth in South Australia, where the level rose from 11.4 to
12.2 per cent. The rate in Victoria rose from 11.8 to 12.1 per cent. Western
Australia achieved a cut from 11.3 to 10.6 per cent.

The murder last June of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, the Algerian acting head of
state, by one of his bodyguards was a conspiracy that mainly benefited
radical Moslem movements, according to a commission of inquiry set up by the
country's leadership writes Francis Ghiles in London.
The 118-page report has not been published, but Mr Rezzag Bara, the
commission chairman, said on state television that the conspiracy was put
together 'by those whose interests were threatened'.
A total of 30 members of the Algerian security forces have been charged with
'serious negligence' in placing Lt Lembarek Boumarafi, the assassin, who was
known for his support for radical Moslem views, in a group whose duty was to
protect a man well known for his opposition to such views. The inquiry did
not determine whether the negligence was deliberate.
No senior Algerian has publicly accused the now banned Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS) of murdering Mr Boudiaf. Indeed, some have privately told
western officials that the FIS is not to blame. The FIS for its part has
never claimed responsibility.

International donors yesterday promised Mozambique Dollars 760m (Pounds

more would be offered at a peace conference in Rome next week, Reuter
reports from Paris.
The World Bank said the Dollars 760m included around Dollars 137m in food
aid, with the rest intended for various economic and social projects plus
import support. Mr Eneas Comiche, Mozambique's finance minister, said he was
hoping for total external support, including a Paris Club debt rescheduling,
of around Dollars 1.2bn in 1993.

RIOTS engulfed five Yemeni towns, including the capital Sanaa, yesterday and
the government said 11 people were killed and 48 civilians and policemen
were injured, Reuter reports from Sanaa.
In Sanaa, where there were no reports of casualties, police fired shots in
the air and tear gas to stop hundreds of demonstrators reaching the
presidential palace.
Witnesses said crowds set fire to government cars. Dozens of people were
arrested and some were beaten by police before being put on trucks and taken
away, the witnesses said.
The disorders were the worst to rock Yemen since the north and south merged
in 1990. Strikes and demonstrations to demand more pay and a price freeze on
essential foodstuffs have dogged Yemen since unification.
The government, under its policy of democratic reforms, has tolerated them
in the past.

FT  11 DEC 92 / US comes to grips with Somali clans: Little hope of a quick
solution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US plunged into the labyrinthine and unstable world of Somali politics
yesterday when it brokered meetings between two of Somalia's rival warlords.
Since it embarked on intervention in Somalia, Washington has said it is
mounting a purely humanitarian operation and will avoid playing a political
role. But now, the US State Department has grasped the reality that a
political solution is fundamental to ending starvation in the conflict-torn
country.
It may, however, be a move it will come to regret.
Complicated and bitter clan rivalries and a fiercely individualistic culture
have fuelled the civil war.
The four main clans, which themselves divide into sub-clans, have set up
militias and formed shifting alliances with the warlords.
The face-to-face meetings between Gen Mohammed Farar Aideed and Ali Mahdi
Mohammed, who control different parts of Mogadishu, will start today at the
gutted US embassy and will be attended by Mr Robert Oakley, US
ambassador-at-large.
The US will guarantee the security of today's talks and act as broker to a
settlement that has eluded the best efforts of the United Nations for more
than a year.
Somali political experts agree that reconciling Gen Aideed and Mr Mahdi  -
who claim allegiance from two different sub-clans of the Hawiye clan, the
Habir Gidir and the Abgal - is the critical first step to a wider national
reconciliation.
Both men claim to be the genuine legitimate leaders of the United Somali
Congress (USC), the politico-military movement which forced former dictator
President Mohammed Siad Barre out of power in January 1991.
Once the split in the USC is repaired, it will be possible to try to heal
the internal divisions in other loose clan-based political movements before
moving forward to a national conference to pave the way to an interim
government followed by elections.
But the first step will be difficult.
The conflict between Gen Aideed and Mr Mahdi is largely a personal power
struggle supported by their two sub-clans.
Many Somalis believe a solution will unfold only when the two warlords have
withdrawn from centre-stage - a move unlikely to be considered by either.
The clans have no fund-amental political, ideological, religious, ethnic or
ling-uistic differences. But there have been clan disputes through Somalia's
history, often over water holes and pastures, scarce resources in a harsh,
drought-plagued land.
A political solution will have to be based on movements representing the
interests of the four leading clans - the Hawiye, Darod, Raheweyne and Isak.
'Clan divisions will never vanish. They are the nuts and bolts of Somali
society. Therefore the world must work on that basis,' says Dr Osman Guled,
a visiting Canadian political scientist.
He says inclusion of powerful Somali merchants will be vital for a
successful political process, as will working out a plan for equitable
distribution of resources and territorial authority for each clan.
Confidence-building, establishing transparent, impartial and objective
institutions of civil society, and getting reconstruction and development
under way will also be vital.
The process is bound to take a long time and tax the patience and resources
of Washington, which is eager for a quick solution.

<TEXT>
IRAQ has adopted a severe austerity package to try to rescue the country
from economic disarray.
In what is seen as an attempt to conserve the country's depleted foreign
currency reserves, save the Iraqi dinar, and curtail profiteering merchants,
the regime is due today to implement a blanket ban on 146 imported consumer
goods.
Frenzied trading in Baghdad has been reported over the past few days with
merchants selling the now banned commodities at knockdown prices to clear
their shelves by the deadline which expired last night.
A relief agency official in the city said: 'From early in the morning to
late at night, thousands of people are buying and selling. A newcomer to
Baghdad would never believe that the country is suffering under the economic
embargo.'
The ban includes a wide range of 'luxury items' such as cheese, canned
vegetables, foreign cigarettes, frozen chicken, furniture and electrical
equipment, and Christmas trees which are no longer permitted to be sold.
Alcohol has been exempted from the ban.
Earlier this year, 42 merchants were executed in Iraq for so-called
'economic sabotage'.

FT  11 DEC 92 / BJP sees Ayodhya as desperate rallying call: The aspirations
of India's Hindu militant opposition party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kewal Ratan Malkani, vice president of the Bharatiya Janata party, the
radical Hindu party whose militant supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque at
the weekend, scorns the view that the incident will backfire against the
BJP.
'It is only the upper classes who are shocked by this. The masses are
delighted,' he said an interview yesterday. 'Look at Maharashtra (the state
which includes Bombay and has born the brunt of the post-Ayodhya violence).
If we had an election there tomorrow we would win.'
The Delhi intelligentsia believes that Mr Malkani is quite wrong. Newspaper
commentators insist that most Indians will now reject the BJP on the grounds
that it foments intolerance. But the BJP has long learnt to do without the
support of commentators.
Mr Malkani's boasts reflect the party's defiant mood. The crisis has
suddenly focused its energies. All the arguments over strategy and tactics
which have dogged it over the past year as it saw its popularity waning have
been set aside. So clear is the aim of advancing Hindu militancy that even
the arrest of top BJP officials, including Mr L K Advani, the leader, for
alleged incitement of religious hatred, has barely curtailed the party's
activities.
Today the BJP plans to stage demonstrations at the Pakistani and Bangladeshi
High Commissions to protest against the destruction of Hindu temples in
those countries.
Mr Malkani was outraged by the suggestion that Moslems were merely reacting
to the Ayodhya assault. 'They started this. Nobody is as patient as a Hindu
but there are limits to our patience.'
Mr Malkani said he regretted that the assault on the mosque was against the
law. He also regretted the violence which has since swept India. But he
accepted none of the responsibility. Instead, he blamed the government of Mr
P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and on the courts for repeatedly
delaying settlement of long-standing Hindu claims to the mosque site.
He also blamed Moslems for allegedly promoting intolerance. 'They smashed
3,000 temples (in the conquest of northern India). We want just three back.'
The three are at Ayodhya, and at Mathura and Varanasi - two other Hindu holy
cities where mosques stand on disputed sites.
Mr Malkani, who is 71 and has spent his life working for militant Hinduism,
speaks like a man who knows that if the BJP cannot fire Hindu passions now,
with the Ayodhya issue burning, perhaps it never will.
The BJP was formed in the early 1980s out of politicians linked to the
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the well-disciplined Hindu militant group which
was one of three Hindu organisations banned last night. It sought to offer
an alternative to the dominant Congress (I) party. But it won just two lower
house parliamentary seats in the 1984 general elections.
However, in 1986, Mr Advani began to fan the flames of the Ayodhya
controversy. He also exploited growing disillusion with the Congress party's
secularism which had united Indians during the struggle to build
post-independent India but now seemed sterile.
He won particular support from upper-caste Hindus, some of whom felt they
were losing status as economic modernisation opened more opportunities to
the low-caste masses. The party's financial strength came from many small
shopkeepers and tradesmen, who felt Congress pampered the big corporations
at their expense.
The BJP tried to make its ideology coherent. Mr Advani said it was a 'nation
first' party. Ideologues explained India should reject secularism and become
an overtly Hindu nation. Historians rewrote parts of India's past to
emphasise, for example, the role of Hindu princes, instead of Moslems, in
opposing British rule. Even maths was not spared  - the Pythagoras theorem
was attributed in one BJP-sponsored textbook to Baudhayan, an Indian
mathematician who allegedly discovered it 450 years before Pythagoras.
In last year's general election, the BJP secured 119 seats out of 543,
making it the second largest party after Congress. It also won control of
the state government in four states - the first taste of real power.
However, the BJP then lost ground. It was unlucky in being unable seriously
to challenge Mr Rao's economic reforms - a key issue over the past 18
months. BJP leaders were early fans of economic deregulation but the prime
minister stole their clothes. The party's clean image was sullied by
divisions between leaders and a minor sex scandal. In governing states, it
suffered from inexperience.
Moreover, even as they were wooed by the cause of Hindu unity, Hindus could
hardly forget their many differences - including caste, language, wealth and
regional origin. Without Ayodhya, it was difficult for the BJP to offer
enough to hold them together. This autumn, when the Ayodhya conflict had
temporarily gone quiet, an opinion survey showed just 14 per cent of those
polled wanted Mr Advani as prime minister, against 49 per cent for Mr Rao.
Mr Pran Chopra, a leading political analyst, is convinced Mr Advani's rating
has fallen further this week: 'Ayodhya will damage the BJP's share of the
total vote. The feelings of committed supporters may have hardened, but the
party will lose mass support.' Mr Chopra believes the voice of moderation
will prevail - a view shared by other analysts.

<TEXT>
THREE HUNDRED consumer, citizen and environmental groups from around the
world yesterday demanded that Uruguay Round negotiators abandon the idea of
creating a Multilateral Trading Organisation with 'massive powers' to
override multilateral, regional and national rules.
Congress Watch, a national consumer group in Washington, published a
statement signed by groups in 70 countries. It said the MTO, proposed as
part of the Uruguay Round, would impose policies on weaker countries; damage
environmental, safety and consumer interests; and reduce international
controls over monopolies.
A senior US trade official yesterday said the Bush administration also had
'a number of concerns' about the proposed text creating an MTO. It would
only support an MTO if its underlying rules were 'reasonable and fair' and
if it did not result 'in a kind of usurpation of functions of sovereign
governments'.
However, the US is not yet satisfied with the underlying rules on
investment, dumping and subsidies. The official suggested that it would be
possible to complete the round without an MTO but with a strengthened
dispute settlement system.
The American delegation in Geneva seems to be struggling with the lame duck
status of the Bush administration, although it stresses the continuity of US
trade policy.
Meanwhile, the US industry groups seeking to reduce tariffs to zero on such
products as paper, wood products, and copper are also worried about lack of
progress. Their support for a final Gatt package is considered crucial for
congressional passage.
Intel Corporation has dropped out of the 'Zero Tariff Coalition' to urge a
break in the Gatt talks until after President-elect Bill Clinton is
inaugurated.

FT  11 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Building faith in EC anti-trust system -
Competition policy reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE anguished debate over subsidiarity, few EC officials tread a more
delicate line than Sir Leon Brittan. As competition commissioner, he has a
pivotal role in policing the single market. Yet the job's far-reaching legal
powers also make it a natural target for those who accuse Brussels of
unwarranted intervention in EC member states' affairs.
This week, Sir Leon attempted to strike a fresh balance by seeking more
authority in one area while offering concessions to critics in others.
Whether or not he remains in his current job beyond the end of this year,
his proposed reforms appear intended as a blueprint for the future evolution
of EC competition policy.
Sir Leon wants to expand the Commission's authority over mergers to cover
smaller deals. That would require approval by member governments, which will
review the workings of the two-year-old EC merger regulation next year.
At the same time, he promised to devolve to national authorities more
responsibility for handling EC competition cases, and to accelerate
Brussels' notoriously long-winded procedures for dealing with anti-trust
cases which fall outside the merger regulation.
In theory, this last proposal could have substantial and immediate
consequences for European business. It also represents Sir Leon's most
concrete response yet to arguments that the Commission's methods are too
slow and opaque, and that its responsibilities should be transferred to an
independent EC competition body.
Commission investigations into cartels, illegal pricing agreements and other
monopolies cases rarely take less than 18 months, and often much longer.
Furthermore, many companies which voluntarily seek Brussels' opinion on the
legality of business arrangements never receive a reply.
'Accelerated procedures are desperately needed,' says Mr Richard Coles,
solicitor at ICI, the UK industrial group, which waited several years in the
1980s for the Commission to clear a joint PVC venture with Enichem of Italy.
It is the Commission's efficient handling of cases under the merger
regulation that has prompted increased complaints about its shortcomings in
other areas of competition policy.
The regulation is administered by a special task force, which must say
whether it objects to a deal within a month after it is notified. If it
does, it then has a further four months to make an in-depth investigation.
Sir Leon now proposes to extend this 'two-stage' deadline system to the rest
of the EC competition directorate's work. The new regime will start on
January 1 for joint venture inquiries and on April 1 for all other types of
case.
But will the roughly 100 Commission anti-trust experts who will be charged
with making the new system work be able - or willing - to deliver? Some
outside experts say they detect evidence of bureaucratic resistance within
the competition directorate.
In any case, the new deadlines, unlike those imposed by the merger
regulation, have no statutory force. Sir Leon says that to make them legally
binding would require extra cash and personnel which, he admits, EC
governments are in no mood to provide.
Some lawyers in Brussels also believe the deadlines may increase still
further the competition directorate's workload by encouraging more companies
to submit pro-posed business agreements for anti-trust clearance.
Nonetheless, senior competition officials are cautiously optimistic about
their ability to cope though, as one admits, the new regime is 'more like an
indication of best endeavours'.
They point out that, in practice, a certain amount of flexibility will be
built into the system. For instance, the clock will only start ticking once
companies have supplied all the information needed to start a preliminary
investigation.
Some legal experts, while applauding Sir Leon's initiative, are openly
sceptical about how much will change in practice. Mr Christopher Bright of
City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines also argues that the reforms do not
address a more fundamental concern about the Commission's methods.
This arises from the discrepancy between the pragmatic and reasoned approach
to cases taken so far by the merger task force and the more doctrinaire
attitude displayed by other parts of the competition directorate.
Others, however, argue that Sir Leon has put Brussels' moral authority over
competition policy on the line by setting out to satisfy critics that it is
capable of exercising its powers fairly and efficiently.
If the Commission fails to live up to that self-imposed challenge, it risks
fuelling demands that it either cede some of its jealously-guarded
prerogatives to national authorities, or be compelled to transfer them to an
independent cartel office.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE negotiators in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks are
casting doubt on the feasibility of concluding a 'political' package by the
end of the year as had been hoped. However, they remain determined to finish
the round before March when the US administration's negotiating mandate runs
out.
Little progress has been made since the Uruguay Round resumed in Geneva on
November 26, following the deal on farm trade between the US and the
European Community. The US, EC and Japan have complained that trading
partners have not shown the necessary sense of urgency.
'We have some difficulty putting the machine in motion; perhaps it has
become too rusty,' said a senior EC official. 'It is looking increasingly
difficult. A lot of issues are not close to being resolved,' a top US
negotiator confirmed.
The Geneva talks have been in abeyance for nearly a year while the two giant
traders bargained over farm subsidies.
The US and EC have also yet to present draft tariff schedules reflecting
their November accord, without which the hard bargaining on reducing tariff
and non-tariff barriers to goods imports cannot begin in earnest. The EC
schedule is due next Tuesday.
Negotiators agreed to seek a 'political' conclusion to the round by
Christmas - that is, to complete the package of fair trade rules covering 15
broad trade sectors and decide on 'the overall shape, content and value' of
specific trade liberalisation commitments for goods and services. This would
be followed by a few weeks of 'tidying-up' work.
However, none of the remaining problems has been resolved. Battles lie ahead
over Japanese rice and some other farm issues. In services, where the EC
yesterday presented a revised liberalisation offer, negotiators disagree on
such key sectors as maritime transport, audiovisual services,
telecommunications and financial services.
The US is unhappy with draft proposals to create a Multilateral Trade
Organisation which would absorb the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
and the proposed sister bodies on services and intellectual property.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US semiconductor industry could reclaim top place in world market share
this year for the first time since the Japanese took it over in 1985,
industry analysts say.
This expected reversal, the first in seven years, is a triumph for US
efforts to boost its electronics capability; it comes as the US
semiconductor market has grown while Japan's has shrunk.
This year, the US chip market is expected to have grown by over 15 per cent,
with Japan's likely to have declined 10 per cent, according to Dataquest,
the high technology consultancy.
Against this background, 'you can easily draw the conclusion that US
companies will gain share at the expense of Japanese companies,' Mr Jim
Eastlake, associate director of Dataquest in the UK, says.
Strong demand for memories and microprocessors from the personal computer
market is why the US market has grown this year, he adds.
The US companies Dataquest expects to have increased market share are Intel,
Motorola and Texas Instruments, numbers three, four and six in the 1991
rankings. . NEC had top spot in 1991, where it has been since 1985, followed
by Toshiba. Hitachi was fifth.
Intel, which is investing heavily in R&amp;D and capital spending is likely to
continue to grow, Mr Eastlake says. It is investing Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.64bn) in combined R&amp;D and capital expenditure, more than the total such
spending being undertaken by the top three European chip makers - Philips,
Siemens and SGS-Thomson - and more than the entire revenue from
semiconductor businesses for Philips or Siemens in 1991.
R&amp;D and capital spending by the top 10 Japanese chip companies totalled
Dollars 10.5bn this year, against Dollars 2bn for Intel alone. NEC's R&amp;D and
capital spending was Dollars 1.5bn, with 1993 Japanese spending expected to
be flat.

<TEXT>
SHELL Eastern Chemicals, Shell Chemicals' Asian subsidiary, has announced it
intends to ask its board next year to approve a SDollars 1bn (Pounds 385m)
styrene monomer and propylene oxide complex in Singapore.
The complex, one of the most important recent investments in Singapore's
rapidly growing chemicals industry, would start production in 1997.
It would have an annual capacity of 320,000 tonnes for styrene monomer,
140,000 tonnes propylene oxide, 80,000 tonnes polyols and 30,000 tonnes
propylene glycol. Shell hopes to build it at Pulau Seraya, one of four
islands designated for Singapore's petrochemicals expansion.
Trichem, the London-based consultants, said the Asian propylene oxide market
was fairly healthy, although South Korea had recently brought on line a
plant and Japan was planning capacity expansion.
However, although there was a shortage of styrene in Asia, global
overcapacity remained a problem. Styrene operating rates could fall to about
80 per cent in 1995, after which they should rise at between 1.5 per cent
and 2 per cent a year.
Meanwhile, Shell Overseas Investments, a holding company owned by Royal
Dutch Shell, said it was extending its shareholding in Petrochemical
Corporation of Singapore from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The shares were
previously held by Temasek Holdings.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Appeal to Bonn on business confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday appealed to the Bonn government to restore business
confidence and bring public spending and deficits under control with an
early and convincing end to discussions on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
projected solidarity pact.
Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the central bank's policy making central
council told a conference business confidence in the economy had
deteriorated drastically to a level not seen since the 1970s.
He was speaking after an earlier press conference at which the bank
announced a modest relaxation of its tough monetary policy, but stuck firmly
to its refusal to lower interest rates.
Explaining the decisions, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president,
referred pointedly to federal and regional budget deficits as he declared
there was still no room for rate cuts. Yesterday's events supported the
growing conviction that while some of the conditions necessary for interest
rate cuts are being met, the central bank will not move until the solidarity
pact's key aims of public spending cuts and wage moderation are delivered.
Chancellor Kohl has said he expects 'significant decisions' in January,
although Mr Wolfgang Roth, economics spokesman for the opposition Social
Democrats said yesterday's monetary policy moves proved the Bundesbank had
no confidence in the government.
An increase in the central bank's target range for growth in the M3 measure
of money supply from 3.5 to 5.5 per cent this year to 4.5 to 6.5 per cent
won wide support from industry and government. According to Mr Theo Waigel,
finance minister, it took into account current recessionary trends in the
west and would guarantee sufficient liquidity for recovery in the east.
Mr Johann Eekhoff, secretary of state in the economics ministry, said he was
glad special factors such as developments in eastern Germany had been taken
into consideration.
The decisions would allow room for growth while maintaining stability, he
added.
Anticipating more criticism from overseas of the central bank's refusal to
reduce interest rates, Mr Eekhoff said complaints that German rates were too
high were unfounded.
Mr Schlesinger said inflation was still too high and there was no room for
reducing rates. Mr Issing added that recent low wage settlements - which
should help bring inflation down - showed a 'clear correction . . . in the
right direction'. However, Mr Schlesinger pointed out that high interest
rates were not yet having the desired effect on public sector deficits.
Private sector economists, who had forecast an upwards shift in the M3
range, said the bank appeared to have set the stage for both growth and
interest rate cuts. The effects of the slowdown, combined with falling
import prices, lower pay claims and a decline in underlying inflation are
read as signs that rates will start to fall in the new year.
The key element yet to fall into place is Chancellor Kohl's mooted
'solidarity pact' between all levels of government, opposition, unions and
employers which aims to encompass firm commitments primarily to public
spending cuts.
Another factor is control of monetary growth which the central bank believes
fuels inflation.
M3 expansion has outstripped targets every month this year. In October the
annualised rate reached 10.3 per cent, but will fall clearly below that in
November, according to Mr Issing.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Million Greeks protest over Macedonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS AT THE UNITED NATIONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 1m Greeks gathered in Athens yesterday to demand that the
international community withhold recognition from the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia unless it changes its name.
The crowd carried banners and shouted 'Macedonia is Greek, Learn Your
History' and 'Macedonia has been Greek for 3,000 Years'. Greece fears unrest
if its neighbour is recognised as Macedonia. The unease is fanned by the
former Yugoslav republic's adoption of the Macedonian star as its emblem.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, yesterday recommended
the dispatch of more than 700 troops and military observers to Macedonia.
The UN Security Council is expected to act on the proposal later today.
Reporting the findings of a recent UN mission to the area, Mr Boutros Ghali
said that without international help 'through a potentially turbulent and
hazardous period', the Macedonians feared a wider Balkans war.
Greece has blocked recognition of Macedonia on the grounds that its name is
exclusively Hellenic property and implies territorial pretensions on its own
northern province of Macedonia. Macedonian leaders say the blocking of
recognition has increased instability. If Greece continues to block
recognition, they plan to take their case to the UN.
The Macedonian parliament yesterday postponed a decision on changing the
name of the republic in order to gain recognition. Yesterday's parliamentary
debate was an effort to push EC leaders to grant Macedonia diplomatic
recognition at the Edinburgh summit.
Mr Hristo Nikovski, undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry, yesterday
warned: 'We will look to the UN. . . This situation is feeding nationalists
from all sides - inside and outside Macedonia.'
Greece is maintaining an unofficial blockade of Macedonia, holding up
deliveries of oil.
'We are facing a complete blockade. We are blocked by the sanctions against
Serbia to the north, and Greece from the south,' said Mr Nikovski.

<TEXT>
NEW EC rules to prevent a weakening of controls over exports of
militarily-useful goods are not expected to be ready in time for the start
of the single internal market on January 1.
Concern is growing that free movement of goods within the EC will enable
'dual-use' items (having both civilian and military applications) to be
exported via members such as Greece and Portugal with the least rigorous
controls.
The Brussels-based Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of
Europe (Unice) said yesterday it was anxious to see free movement of these
goods within Europe and a harmonised system of external border controls, but
did not expect an early EC agreement to implement such a system.
The UK is due to put compromise proposals to an EC Council high-level
working group on Monday. The issue was discussed recently between Unice
representatives and Mr John Meadway, head of the export trade division at
the UK Department of Trade and Industry.
A confidential minute of the meeting raised the prospect of 'licence
shopping' by manufacturers trying to exploit weak points in member states'
controls to sell to forbidden destinations. It said member states seemed
'reluctant to have a Community export controls policy'. They favoured an
'inter-governmental agreement' with 'informal exchanges of information on
sensitive destinations'.
The aim would be to agree on a common list of friendly countries eligible
for simplified export procedures. 'The idea of a common list of sensitive
projects is more problematic,' the report said.

<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of police in six German states raided the homes and offices of
suspected neo-Nazis yesterday, as the government stepped up its crackdown on
racist violence and right-wing extremism.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, banned a second neo-Nazi
organisation, the German Alternative (DA), and the federal prosecutor
arrested two members of a self-styled militia group, called the 'Werewolf
Hunting Unit'.
The moves came as Chancellor Helmut Kohl led the German parliament in its
strongest and most united condemnation of the rash of racist attacks on
foreigners and asylum-seekers' hostels.
The number of attacks on foreigners has risen from 2,462 last year, to 4,587
recorded so far this year, according to the federal criminal investigation
office.
Mr Kohl said the country was facing a 'terrifying increase in violence', in
which there was no justification for anyone to indulge in violence.
Mr Seiters denounced the DA as a neo-Nazi organisation particularly active
in eastern Germany.
Police immediately launched raids on the homes and offices of an estimated
300 members in Berlin, Brandenburg, and Saxony, in the east, and Hesse,
North Rhine-Westphalia and the Rhineland-Palatinate in west Germany.
The organisation was to contest local elections in east Germany, and
propaganda documents, as well as a motley arsenal of weapons such as a
sawn-off air rifle and a starting pistol, were seized in the raids.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Car makers to list prices for all of EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAR MAKERS will have to publish comparative EC price-lists for selected new
vehicles twice a year from next May, under a plan agreed with the European
Commission.
The plan - to be announced by the Commission next week - is aimed at helping
consumers shop for car bargains across EC borders. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC
competition commissioner, believes it could also increase the pressure on
manufacturers to bring EC car prices into line, and make it more difficult
for car dealers to discriminate against foreign buyers.
According to a survey published last month by Beuc, the European consumers'
organisation, the price of certain new models can differ by more than 40 per
cent between countries. Manufacturers point out that prices are mostly
within the 12 per cent band recommended by the Commission.
The Commission plan is not legally binding, but EC officials indicated
yesterday that if car-makers do not co-operate they will risk losing their
jealously guarded right to distribute cars through exclusive dealerships
when the system comes up for review in mid-1995.
Every manufacturer which sells cars in the Community will have to select a
representative model from each part of its product range and publish the
prices in 10 EC countries. The carmakers will also have to supply
information about the price of five common options - anti-lock braking
systems, air conditioning, right-hand drive, automatic gearbox and power
steering - and details of warranty, roadside assistance options and delivery
costs.
Prices, published in May and November every year, will be shown both before
and after tax, in Ecu and local currency. Comparative figures for Denmark
and Greece - where car tax of more than 100 per cent distorts the selling
price - will not be included.
The Commission agreed to drop its original demand that manufacturers should
supply information about all possible models and options on the grounds that
it would be too time-consuming for manufacturers and confusing for
consumers.
Manufacturers are still likely to argue that realistic comparison is
difficult because dealers in some countries are prepared to offer large
discounts on the list price of certain models. However, they will also hope
that by being more open about comparative prices they will stave off the
abolition of their network of exclusive dealerships, which are exempt from
normal EC competition rules until 1995. Sir Leon Brittan, who heralded the
new price initiative in a speech to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders in London last month, has recently taken action to end alleged
abuses of the dealership system by Alfa Romeo and Citroen in Belgium and
Luxembourg.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Mr Giuliano Amato yesterday approved a decree designed to
revolutionise the work habits of Italy's pampered and inefficient 3m civil
service, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The reform envisages the introduction of performance-monitored work
contracts, greater departmental responsibility, harmonisation of pay
structures, staggered hours, greater job flexibility and the state's right
to sack. The philosophy behind the measures is to impose private-sector
principles of work on civil servants and to reverse the situation whereby
the public must be beholden to them for the favour of their services. Mr
Raffaele Costa, minister for EC affairs and in charge of the reforms,
described the decree as 'a great step forward' which in the medium term
would raise the civil service to EC levels. The shake-up was one of four
main reforms endorsed by parliament two months ago.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Germany last night patched up their quarrel over the future of
the European Fighter Aircraft, enabling work to continue on a revised
project.
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, agreed that Bonn would take part
alongside the UK, Italy and Spain in completing development work.
'I think that taxpayers of all four countries will be delighted,' Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the UK defence secretary said.
The agreement reached during a Nato ministerial meeting brings significant
relief to aerospace and electronics manufacturers in the four countries,
where tens of thousands of jobs are staked on the Pounds 20bn fighter
programme.
The project was thrown into doubt after Germany said in June it would not
proceed with producing the aircraft as it then stood. Its continued
participation in development was also in question.
The modified project, renamed Eurofighter 2000, will use the airframe and
engines as planned, but will permit each nation to install different
standards of equipment.
Yesterday's agreement is seen as a climbdown by Mr Ruhe, who previously
insisted on a fundamental redesign. Mr Ruhe accepted yesterday that a wholly
new aircraft was ruled out because more than half the Pounds 8bn development
money had already been spent.
The remaining funds could now be directed into a more suitable programme,
and development work could be slowed down, Mr Ruhe said. 'I think everybody
is happy there's a chance for a cheaper plane,' he added. He also said he
wanted the project to be open to other European partners.
He ruled out any German decision on production of the new aircraft before
1995 and said the Bundestag would have to vote on it. This timetable poses
potentially serious problems for Britain and Italy which want no more than a
two year delay in the programme, with first deliveries of aircraft in 2000.
Germany and Spain do not want deliveries until 2002.
German officials said further studies were now required in order to
translate revised military requirements - agreed by the four chiefs of
defence staff in Rome last month - into new technical specifications.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Many long-term jobless never employed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 40 per cent of European Community citizens unemployed for more than
one year - about three million people - have never had a job, according to
the European Commission.
The vast majority are under 25 and concentrated in the southern EC states.
In Italy, 78 per cent of those unemployed for a year or more have never had
a job and in Greece the figure is 65 per cent.
Those out of work for more than a year account for about half of the EC's 16
million unemployed, compared with only 6 per cent in the US and 18 per cent
in Japan, according to the London-based Employment Policy Institute.
These 'outsiders' in the European jobs market cease being part of the
effective labour supply and cannot act as a constraint on wage bargainers,
argues the EPI in an analysis of European unemployment published today.
The EC Commission expects EC unemployment, which is just under 10 per cent,
to rise to 11 per cent and to remain there until 1996. Only the Netherlands
has seen its unemployment rate fall since 1990, from 7.3 per cent to 6 per
cent.
The Commission projects that the population of working age will rise by
between 3 per cent and 5 per cent over the next 10 years and then remain
virtually static until 2010.
The EPI expects most new jobs to come in the service sector and a further
shift away from unskilled employment. That will intensify the need for
vocational qualifications, it says. About two-thirds of EC workers have a
vocational qualification, although less than half of UK workers do.
EC member states spend on average 2.25 per cent of GDP on the unemployed, of
which nearly two-thirds goes on 'passive' assistance such as benefit and
one-third on 'active' assistance such as counselling. The EPI argues that
these proportions must be reversed.

France's central bank yesterday announced a slight easing of its money
supply target for next year, to take account of an expected small pick-up in
economic growth, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The new range for growth
of the M3 measure of broad money will be between 4 per cent and 6.5 per
cent, said Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Banque de France. M3 is
set to grow by 6 per cent, right at the top of its 4 per cent to 6 per cent
target for 1992, which Mr de Larosiere attributed to a rise in savings.
He stressed that the central policy objectives would continue to be to
defend the franc's stability and to control inflation, but that enlargement
of the M3 target was justified to give 'every chance' for an economic
recovery.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Yeltsin in people power gamble: The Russian president hopes
he still has the common touch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, looked unhappy yesterday as he
stood on an improvised podium in the Moskvich car assembly factory. Earlier,
he had thrown down the gauntlet to the country's parliament and embarked on
an openly populist campaign to win support for a referendum on who rules
Russia.
Appealing to the people is a road Mr Yeltsin, a master of the popular touch
and the first directly elected leader in Russian history, has travelled
before. But this time it is a final gamble: obtaining support for deeply
unpopular reforms, or abandoning them to a populist Congress of People's
Deputies.
His speech at an impromptu rally at the Lenin Komsomol Car Plant (AZLK), was
vintage, if somewhat subdued. Yeltsin, defiant, with a touch of humour.
'No reform . . . has ever been carried through to the end in Russia,' he
said, referring to Russian reformers Peter the Great and Peter Stolypin.
Denouncing the congress as 'full of Communist party apparatchiks' opposed to
reforms, he said that ordinary people in contrast had understood the changes
undertaken by Mr Yegor Gaidar whose rejection by parliament sparked
yesterday's declaration of war on the congress.
As he met with the people in an industrial suburb, Moscow truck drivers
lined the Kremlin with lorries and some 5,000 people attended a rally in
support of the Russian leader. But the mixed response from the hundreds of
car workers who flocked to see the president also illustrated the fragility
of the support he can expect.
Despite earning four to five times more than most Russians, industrial
workers' support for Mr Yeltsin, like that of their managers, is partly a
function of help given to individual plants by the government.
Teachers, doctors, bureaucrats and pensioners may be less generous towards
him.
The reservations attached to the supportive messages delivered by two of the
workers who spoke at the rally also echoed the message of the centrist Civic
Union with whom the government had been negotiating. 'Your aim is splendid
but change your tactics,' said Mr Sergei Novopolsky, a metal worker, who
urged the president to protect the country from the mafia and to stick to
his promise to index billions of roubles of savings.
'If life improves just a little bit, people will support you
wholeheartedly,' said Mr Anatoly Ribakov, whose attack on the street traders
who have become a daily source of irritation for Muscovites sparked the
greater applause.
Nobody dared vote against the president in a show of hands called for after
the event.
However, most of the workers interviewed in a random survey said that they
would probably opt for Mr Yeltsin if forced to choose between his reforms
and the congress. 'Since Gaidar started the reforms, let him continue them.
'We're young and we've got life ahead of us, and that gives us something to
look forward to,' said Sergei, 22.
But some workers also displayed either the confusion, or angry indifference
born of economic hardship which may outweigh traditional respect for the
country's 'khozain' (boss) in a referendum.
An older woman in the crowd who declined to be named said: 'I only rely on
myself.
'I've become so nasty with what's going on that I hope you foreigners who
are robbing the country will leave,' without substantiating her outburst.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Floating Norwegian krone may hit ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S krone was floated yesterday, rekindling concern about a fresh
outbreak of international speculation against currencies inside the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
As a result the krone suffered a 5 per cent devaluation against other
European currencies. The Oslo bourse closed up 28 points at 399.
The Norwegian central bank's decision brings the country into line with its
neighbours, Finland and Sweden who abandoned fixed exchange rates in the
autumn.
The central bank's overnight lending rate to commercial banks was cut to 11
per cent from 16 per cent.
The European Commission in Brussels said that it regretted the Norwegian
move.
The krone was first pegged to the Ecu on October 19, 1990, within a margin
of plus and minus 2.25 per cent from a fixed rate of NKr7.9940 per Ecu.
Mr Hermod Skanland, the central bank governor, said the main reason for
floating the currency was 'the general lack of trust in fixed exchange rates
on the markets'.
At the time of the floating of Sweden's krona on November 19 an estimated
NKr51bn (Pounds 5bn) flowed out of Norway and only about SKr11bn (Pounds
1bn) returned but it was the onset of krone selling on Wednesday that forced
the central bank to act. Mr Torje Osmundssen, director at Norway's
employers' association, Noho, said one explanation for the market pressure
on the krone in recent days stemmed from the fact that 'the markets cannot
distinguish one Nordic economy from another'.
Norway is one of the few countries in Europe to meet the tough financial
convergence requirements set out in the Maastricht treaty for European
economic and monetary union, with a manageable budget deficit and public
sector debt as well as low inflation and relatively low interest rate
levels.
Mr Osmundssen said the floating of the currency was a 'very natural
adaptation' since Norway's main trading partners - Britain, Sweden and
Finland - had all abandoned a fixed exchange rate for their currencies.
The central bank tried to defend the fixed exchange rate of the Norwegian
krone against severe pressure by increasing its own overnight lending rate
to 16 per cent and limiting commercial bank access to its own overnight
borrowing facility.
But these measures failed to normalise conditions on the markets. The
central bank governor said he had come to the conclusion that a further rise
in interest rates would not have stabilised the situation either.

DELIVERING a traditional pre-summit appeal for European unity, Mr Jacques

decision. He did not mention the word 'Maastricht'. Mr Delors, who received
an honorary degree yesterday from the vice chancellor of Edinburgh
University, Sir David Smith, used his acceptance address to call for an
'organised and caring' Community which would be more than merely a free
trade area.
Dressed in a red gown and looking less like a would-be Emperor of Europe
than a slightly abashed Meistersinger, Mr Delors admitted the EC was going
through a period of doom and gloom. He urged the Community to look beyond
its ups and downs and create unity in diversity.
Although he praised the single European market, he avoided referring to the
Maastricht treaty on European union.

FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Major stands firm over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major last night flatly rejected demands from his European Community
partners to speed British ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
The British prime minister insisted he would go no further than his previous
commitment to ratify the agreement during the present session of parliament,
which ends in the autumn.
As Mr Major prepared for meetings last night with Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president and Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president,
British ministers insisted the 'political reality' at Westminster precluded
a pledge in Edinburgh to speed up ratification. But the prime minister
privately will tell his European counterparts that a deal at the summit to
accommodate Danish objections to Maastricht would lower the political
hurdles to British ratification.
This week Mr Mitterrand criticised Mr Major for linking the next crucial
House of Commons vote on the treaty - the third reading - to the second
Danish referendum expected in May. The prime minister has been deliberately
ambivalent about whether he would delay that vote still further if Denmark
put back the date of the referendum.
Senior British ministers said the ambivalence was essential because of the
government's precarious majority in the face of a revolt by Conservative
Euro-sceptics. They warned also that if Denmark did not get a satisfactory
deal from the Community there was no prospect that the Westminster
parliament would ratify Maastricht.
For his part, Mr Major dismissed talk of a two-speed Europe in which Denmark
and the UK are left behind. His judgment is that the difficulties for the
other 10 in constructing a new agreement to replace Maastricht would far
outweigh the inconvenience they now face in waiting for the two countries to
ratify the original agreement.
Despite the inevitable eve-of-summit warnings about the complexity and
difficulty of the issues facing EC leaders in Edinburgh, Mr Major is quietly
confident that agreements on both the Danish question and a future financing
package can be struck if all 12 leaders demonstrate the necessary 'political
will'.
British officials anticipate that the biggest threat is a row with Mr Felipe
Gonzalez of Spain and the leaders of other southern EC states over proposals
to limit increases in Community expenditure.
He will warn his colleagues that a breakdown at the summit could threaten
renewed turmoil in the financial markets and a further slump in economic
confidence: 'They (the leaders) will be left in no doubt about how high the
stakes are,' one British official said.

SUPPORTERS of the Edinburgh international festival complain each summer that
the official festival is in danger of being outdone by the scruffier but
much more prolific fringe.
This being Edinburgh, the summit has to have a fringe. And the official
events stand little chance of making the impact on the people of Edinburgh
which the dozens of fringe events will have.
The summit is after all a largely secret meeting, almost invisible to the
outside world, of 12 men (with several thousand officials and journalists in
attendance). Most people will be lucky to glimpse more than a few speeding
motorcades.
But in the fringe there are demonstrations, marches, alternative summits and
conferences, as well as open-air concerts and street theatre.
Yesterday the fringe broke into the dignified part of the programme when
protesters twice interrupted the Edinburgh University ceremony at which Mr
Jacques Delors was given an honorary degree. Some were from a left-wing
organisation called the EC Summit Unwelcoming Committee, which later staged
a march of people chanting: 'It's your slump, we won't pay.'
But the most significant event could be the Scotland Demands Democracy march
and rally tomorrow, which should involve all political parties pressing for
constitutional change for Scotland.
The protest, organised by the Scottish Trades Union Congress, is intended to
remind Mr John Major that there is still strong demand for change, despite
the setback suffered by devolution and independence campaigners in the
election.
Speakers from the Scottish National Party, Labour and the Liberal Democrats
will argue that it is hypocritical for Mr Major to say subsidiarity should
apply to Britain but not apply to Scotland - a nation within Britain.
Today the campaign to save Scottish regiments scheduled for merger will
march with pipes and drums under the command of retired General Sir John
MacMillan and hand a petition to Mr Major at Edinburgh Castle. Elsewhere,
Scottish fishermen will be demonstrating against the EC Common Fisheries
Policy.
For most of the week a poverty summit has been discussing the impact of the
industrialised world on developing countries. Socialist Party leaders from
19 European countries have been meeting under the chairmanship of Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader. Today and tomorrow experts on the Balkans will
hold a conference on Bosnia.
Tomorrow afternoon the people of Edinburgh are invited to surge out into the
streets, first for an open-air market, then for Summit in the City, a
programme of open-air rock concerts and street theatre. Warm clothes are
recommended, just as for the festival in the summer.

FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Spain set to reject budget compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN is likely to reject British proposals to break the deadlock over the
Delors II plan for future financing of the Community.
The British presidency's compromise keeps the same ceiling on revenue of
1.25 per cent of EC gross national product, but allocates marginal increases
in transfers to poorer member states.
It also adds small amounts to spending on policies like research and
development and foreign policy, which France in particular is keen to see.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, had originally proposed a one-third
increase in the EC budget, raising the revenue base from its ceiling of 1.2
per cent to 1.37 per cent by 1997. This would have meant an increase in the
annual Community budget from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54bn) now to Ecu87.5bn in
1997, in today's money.
Mr Delors subsequently suggested raising the revenue ceiling to 1.32 per
cent of GNP by 1999, increasing the budget to Ecu86.2bn (in 1992 money) by
then, and giving the poorer countries close to the doubling in development
aid the Commission originally planned.
Spain - in alliance with Ireland, Portugal, Greece and the Commission - had
said the UK's suggested ceiling was unacceptable. Last night Spanish
officials said formally they were still studying the new proposals, but
privately they dismissed them as a non-starter.
The main changes in the UK proposal are to add an extra Ecu1.25bn to the
cohesion fund over 1993 to 1999, raising it to Ecu13.5bn, and to increase
slightly structural funds for backward regions.
The cohesion fund, created at Maastricht on Spanish insistence, is to help
Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece to meet EC environmental standards and
build up transport links with the rest of Europe. The structural funds,
however, apportion much more to the EC's backward regions, located largely
in these countries. It is these funds which will be the main battlefield in
today's negotiations.
The European Commission, supported by such countries as France, Belgium and
Luxembourg, has said it fears today's debate could polarise between the rich
north and poorer south.

THE Portuguese parliament yesterday ratified the Maastricht treaty by an
overwhelming majority.
Only 22 members of the 230-seat parliament, including the old-guard
Communist Party, the conservative Centre Social Democrats and independents,
voted against ratification. One Social Democrat rebel declined to vote. The
ruling centre-right Social Democrats and the main opposition Socialist Party
backed the treaty.
Ratification will require Portugal to change its constitution on sharing
sovereignty, allowing foreign residents to vote in local and European
parliamentary elections, and ending the exclusive right of the Bank of
Portugal, the central bank, to issue money.

MR Poul Schluter left for Edinburgh yesterday pledging that he would not be
the Danish prime minister to lead Denmark out of the Community.
'We will do our utmost to secure a deal in Scotland which will meet all the
Danish requirements,' he said.
However, the seven parties who have agreed a common stance on on Denmark's
requirements refused to give the government a mandate to negotiate on the
basis of proposals put forward by Britain for resolving the impasse.
Any deal based on the British proposals would be rejected by the left-wing
Socialist People's Party. Other parties have expressed qualified approval.
It will be up to Mr Schluter and his foreign minister, Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, to decide whether to conclude a deal with the other 11
heads of government. If the deal is subsequently rejected by other parties,
the government will have to fight the issue out in parliament, and if
defeated would probably call an election.

THE exact timing remains unclear. But, sometime in the afternoon of Saturday
September 12, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet went through one of those
chameleon-like changes which top international bureaucrats sometimes
experience.
As a senior French official, he had stood that morning alongside his boss,
Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, receiving high-level visitors
from Germany in France's steel and glass finance ministry at the
unfashionable end of Paris, near the Gare de Lyon.
Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the powerful Bundesbank, and Horst Kohler,
state secretary at the Bonn Finance Ministry, were on their way to Rome.
They had told the French government that Germany wanted to negotiate the
first substantial realignment in the European exchange rate mechanism in
more than five years.
By late evening, Mr Trichet had switched roles. He had exchanged his French
civil servant's hat for that of an EC functionary as he prepared to relay to
Community member states two pieces of important news: Italy was planning to
devalue the lira by 7 per cent in the European Monetary System; and Germany
had promised a cut in interest rates in an attempt to calm turmoil in the
ERM.
What he did not tell them was the Germans wanted a broader realignment of
currencies within the system, including sterling.
The ERM, a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, was no longer
capable of providing monetary stability for Europe. The planned realignment
was a radical move to restore order to the system and keep alive hopes of
progress to economic and monetary union (Emu).
Mr Trichet is director of the French treasury, the most coveted position in
France's civil service hierarchy. He is also chairman of the European
Community's monetary committee, the secretive group which helps manage
European monetary affairs. His actions that weekend were to play a crucial
role in determining how the ERM crisis unfolded.
Some critics have accused him of putting French interests above those of the
Community - by trying to place a protective 'ring-fence' around Italy's
devaluation so that the French franc would be shielded from speculative
attacks in the week ahead of France's closely contested September 20
referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Others charge that he failed to tell
the UK that Germany wanted a broader realignment, including sterling.
With hindsight, some officials have argued that, if Mr Trichet had pushed
for an early weekend meeting of the monetary committee or of EC finance
ministers, the EC might have organised a broader realignment that would have
calmed the growing fever on financial markets and perhaps even have ensured
Britain's continued ERM membership. He has been cast as the eminence grise
who scuppered such an opportunity.
The truth, as a Financial Times investigation, which has included dozens of
interviews with top officials across the EC makes clear, is both more
complex and
Mr Trichet has told colleagues that, in his capacity as a French official,
he could not use the highly-sensitive information given to him by the
Germans that morning to set in motion discussions leading to a broader
realignment. When wearing his monetary committee hat later in the day, he
accepted as a fait accompli the news of the Italian devaluation and took no
steps to broaden the scope of the weekend's currency changes, arguing that
he could not negotiate on behalf of individual member states.
The crisis that has shaken the EC's system of fixed but adjustable exchange
rates since September is a story of communications failures at all levels.
Mr Trichet's behaviour accorded with the letter of the Community's arcane
rule-book, but it did nothing to avert turmoil.
Yet Mr Trichet's split personality on that Saturday merely typified the
bureaucratic contortions that drove the EMS into the biggest crisis in its
13-year history.
Even though currencies will not feature on the formal agenda of the European
Community's summit in Edinburgh today, the autumn crisis will haunt the 12
leaders of the EC member states.
Ambitious plans for Emu by the end of the decade have been set back by Black
Wednesday's traumatic suspension of sterling and the Italian lira from the
ERM and by subsequent crises and disruptions.
Time and again, this autumn's European crisis was bedevilled by human
failure and institutional weakness. The crucial meeting of EC finance
ministers in Bath on September 4 and 5 exemplified this; so, too, did the
events which led to devaluation of the Italian lira and the turmoil which
culminated in Black Wednesday.
The EMS looked ripe for change when the ministers met in Bath. Funds were
haemorrhaging out of the lira into the D-Mark, threatening exchange rate
relationships that had stood for 5 3/4 years.
The UK government's policy of trying to hold sterling's ERM parity at DM2.95
against the D-Mark during a harsh recession was looking threadbare. The fact
that opinion polls in France pointed to a possible government defeat in the
September referendum increased the chances of a massive speculative attack
against currencies in the EMS.
The twice-yearly informal 'Ecofin council' is usually something of a treat
for the ministers and governors, their close aides and their spouses. Bath
was different.
'It was the worst I've ever attended,' said one veteran of nearly 20 such
gatherings. 'A disaster,' concluded another. Nobody who attended has a good
word to say about it, least of all senior British Treasury officials who
were summoned late on Saturday September 5 to help break deadlock. Mr Ruud
Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, was later to say that the failure to
arrange a realignment at the meeting would go down as a 'black page in the
book of 1992'.
But a realignment was never properly discussed at Bath. Instead, the meeting
set what was to become a familiar pattern of half-articulated expectations
by some countries that were deliberately ignored by others.
Neither Mr Lamont nor Mr Sapin, his close ally in the talks, would
contemplate any devaluation of their currencies. Mr Sapin's position was
that there could be no ERM realignment before the Maastricht referendum. The
Italians, in office for only a few months, kept their heads down.
Nobody uttered the 'R-word' in the meeting. Instead, Mr Lamont turned
repeatedly on Mr Schlesinger, urging him to cut German interest rates. 'It
was tense,' observed one continental official. 'Unilateral pressure was put
on one partner in a repeated way.'
Mr Schlesinger - as mere primus inter pares on the Bundesbank's
decision-making council - was statutorily unable to deliver any such
promise. He was also temperamentally disinclined to yield to political
pressure.
Faced with Mr Lamont's battering ram tactics, Mr Schlesinger nearly walked
out. Some days later, he complained that he had been asked four times to cut
rates and had to reply No four times 'when only once should have done'.
Mr Lubbers later blamed Bath's failure on 'political motives'. Realignment,
he said, 'was not possible - because England had its pride and France said
that it couldn't be done because it was facing a difficult referendum and
they couldn't discuss it; and the English said then that the Bundesbank
should do something first, and so the discussion went.'
Certainly, realignment was in the air, despite Mr Lamont's and Mr Sapin's
efforts to keep it off the agenda. Outside the Bath Assembly rooms, Mr
Waigel, the German finance minister, was asked by journalists whether a
realignment was being discussed. He stonewalled, answering that such a move
would need unanimous support from ERM states, which was not forthcoming.
Inside the Assembly Rooms, Mr Schlesinger made comments that officials
present were later to interpret as signals that the Bundesbank favoured a
realignment. At the time, however, almost no-one realised the significance
of his words.
The ministers finally knocked together a four-point statement which
reaffirmed their opposition to a realignment and referred to a Bundesbank
promise not to raise its interest rates. Mr Lamont was quick to imply that
this had been a victory over the mighty Bundesbank, a suggestion that
angered Mr Schlesinger. Any calming effect the statement might have had on
financial markets was undermined the next day when Mr Schlesinger said the
Bundesbank pledge represented no change in policy and distanced himself from
the agreement not to realign ERM exchange rates.
In the days after Bath, the ERM suffered further blows. The Finnish markka,
which had been pegged to the Ecu, the EC's embryonic currency, was allowed
to float after suffering extended speculative attack. Sweden began a costly
and ultimately futile bid to keep its krona pegged to the Ecu by intervening
heavily on currency markets and pushing its interest rates to 500 per cent
at one point. The Italian lira was sold heavily, finally falling below its
ERM floor on Friday September 11 in spite of massive support from the
Bundesbank and Bank of Italy.
After having to buy an unprecedented DM24bn worth of lire in less than a
week, Mr Schlesinger sought the German government's support for a general
realignment in the ERM. It was at a special meeting in the Bundesbank on
Friday evening, that Mr Tietmeyer and Mr Kohler were asked to go to Rome by
way of Paris, to negotiate a devaluation of the lira and seek a realignment
involving other currencies.
In one respect, the monetary manoeuvrings of the September 12-13 weekend
started under a more favourable star than in Bath. In discussions with
Chancellor Kohl and his financial advisers, Mr Schlesinger made a
potentially far-reaching concession that earned him criticism at home when
it became known after the weekend. He made clear the Bundesbank would be
prepared to bargain a cut in German interest rates in return for a
realignment. The extent would depend on the number of countries taking part.
On Saturday and Sunday, the Bundesbank president contacted members of the
bank's council to discuss the scope of the interest rate cut. However, the
Bundesbank made no effort to contact the Bank of England or British
government. 'It was not our job to inform the British of our intentions,' Mr
Schlesinger would say later.
The absence of timely communication with London was to diminish greatly
prospects for the broad realignment the Bundesbank sought.
Once a member state seeks a realignment, it is the job of the EC monetary
committee, whose chairman is Mr Trichet, to find out the views of other
member states. On that weekend, Mr Andreas Kees, the committee secretary who
usually canvasses ERM members before convening a meeting of the committee,
was away boating.
Mr Trichet had to sound out members for a meeting. He decided against such a
gathering. Mr Trichet's decision to handle the lira devaluation by phone is
now recognised by all - including, it seems, Mr Trichet - as a mistake. It
stifled a broader debate on currencies that weekend. There was no
opportunity for bilateral meetings with the chairman in which room for
compromise could be assessed.
Instead, that weekend again illustrated how difficult it is for EMS member
states to thrash out delicate policy issues.
It is unclear whether Messrs Kohler and Tietmeyer realised Mr Trichet was
acting as a French government official alone, and not as EC monetary
committee chairman, when they met him and Mr Sapin in Paris en route to
Rome.
What is certain is that Mr Trichet interpreted their visit as a kind of
courtesy call. He knew that the Germans wanted a broad realignment, but
believed they had come to advise the French government of a potentially
difficult situation just one week before the Maastricht referendum. The
German visitors never made a precise request for London to devalue; nor did
they propose new parities for the pound.
It was in the evening after he was told by telephone of the outcome of the
German-Italian negotiations in Rome that Mr Trichet put on his monetary
committee hat. It was his duty to see whether the other ERM members approved
the planned 7 per cent lira devaluation, and he duly contacted them. But he
did not consider it his job to sound out others about broader realignment.
After all, he reasoned, the positions of the various countries were known.
France had said it did not want to devalue. Both Mr Major and Lamont had
publicly rejected devaluation, turning it into a prestige issue. Although it
had been fairly clear since the Bath meeting that Germany wanted a broad
realignment, it would have been a delicate matter to have suggested a
devaluation to the British because the pound had not been under pressure in
the previous week.
Others have argued that he took a narrow view of his job. 'To do that
realignment by phone was unacceptable,' complained one continental central
banker. 'Not only was the issue too delicate to be handled by phone. The
procedure meant that not everybody was in possession of the same
information.'
But any of the ERM countries could have insisted on a meeting of either the
monetary committee or ministers if they wanted more than the 7 per cent lira
devaluation of that weekend. They had an opportunity to act when Mr Trichet
contacted them from Saturday evening onwards, or when the draft monetary
committee communiques announcing the realignment were circulated. But none
did so.
Mr Trichet also felt confident a successful realignment could be handled by
phone. On three previous occasions the lira parity had been changed in the
EMS without a meeting. Moreover, by late Saturday, when he received the news
from Rome, time was running short.
This is acknowledged in Bonn. According to a senior German Finance Ministry
official, Mr Trichet was 'under a very difficult time restraint, and
operating in a very difficult environment'.
'We came together very late that weekend with the Italians, asking for a
realignment,' the German official said. 'On Friday evening, when invitations
normally go out for monetary committee meetings, we were talking among
ourselves. It was only on Saturday that we could really offer something in
terms of interest rate moves, and we could really pull the Italians on
board.'
British officials say that the first they heard of a realignment was on
Saturday evening when they were asked: 'Do you consent' to the Italian
devaluation against the D-Mark?
The weekend development was so unexpected that Whitehall had to mount a
large-scale search operation to trace Sir Terry Burns, the permanent
secretary to the Treasury. He was finally tracked down in Dulwich, a south
London suburb, at a party celebrating a friend's 25th wedding anniversary.
He learned the news on a mobile phone from Sir Nigel Wicks, the second
permanent secretary, who, conscious of recent security breaches on mobile
phones, would only refer obliquely to a problem with 'our sick friend'. Mr
Lamont, who was at the last night of the Proms, was also only told of
developments at a late stage.
Although there was some concern that the lira devaluation could mean further
volatility in the ERM ahead of France's referendum, there was no sense of
imminent doom early on Sunday when Mr Lamont met senior officials in the UK
Treasury to discuss developments. By then, according to UK officials, it was
known the Bundesbank would cut its Lombard rate by  1/4 percentage points
the next day and announce cuts of  1/2 point in its discount and money
market rates.
When Sir Terry asked, as a matter of form, whether sterling would join in
the realignment with a devaluation, the answer from the chancellor was No.
Superficially, the 7 per cent lira devaluation appeared almost a text book
realignment. It had been carried out behind the scenes, apparently without
fuss. But there were some worrying loose ends and signs that all might not
be well.
The Italian government was unhappy to be devaluing alone. On Sunday morning,
Mr Guiliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, rang Mr Major, who was
staying with the Queen at Balmoral, to tell him about the planned lira
devaluation. He asked if the UK was joining the realignment. Mr Major said
No. According to Downing Street, the Italian premier did not then press the
UK to devalue.
Just before going to church with the Queen, Mr Major telephoned Mr Lamont at
the Treasury meeting to confirm the no devaluation line.
But, by Sunday afternoon, some UK officials feared the lira devaluation
would trigger further speculative pressure in the ERM ahead of the French
referendum. They were to argue later that Germany should have 'nursed the
lira through' until September 20.
There was also concern in the Bundesbank that the changes would not satisfy
the markets. The Italian government, it emerged later, thought the scale of
the devaluation too small. Rome believed 15 per cent was necessary to
restore competitiveness, although it recognised that such a large lira
devaluation would almost certainly have been blocked by France because it
would have given Italian exporters a big price advantage.
Whatever Mr Trichet's motives, the scene was set for the last act of the
drama before Black Wednesday. The scale of inflows into Germany the week
before showed that markets could wield awesome power in an age of almost
unrestricted capital movements. The 7 per cent lira devaluation had been
sufficiently large to reward speculators. There was enough dissonance among
policy makers to encourage fund managers and corporate treasurers to take a
further shot at the ERM.
By the afternoon of Tuesday September 15, sterling was in trouble. It closed
in London just a fifth of a pfennig above its ERM foor of DM2.778, at its
lowest ever level in the mechanism. The Treasury called a high-level crisis
meeting in Chancellor Lamont's office with senior Bank of England officials
to discuss tactics for the next day.
As the meeting was in progress sterling suffered its knock-out blow - as a
result of yet another misunderstanding. News agency reports appeared on
Tuesday evening of an interview by Mr Schlesinger with Handelsblatt, the
German newspaper. He was quoted as favouring a more comprehensive
realignment. The news pushed sterling through its ERM floor in after-hours
dealings. Two frantic telephone calls between Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Schlesinger got the response that
the remarks were 'not authorised'. While the governor was initially
reassured, Mr Lamont, according to one participant, was angry and
anticipated trouble. He abruptly silenced Mr Leigh-Pemberton.
Though denials were soon forthcoming, the scene had been set for a day of
carnage on the foreign exchanges. Mr Schlesinger's purported remarks were
too close to the known views of many top officials in the German central
bank - including his own.
Twenty four hours later, Mr Lamont was outside the Treasury facing the
television cameras. He announced Britain's withdrawal from the European
exchange rate mechanism. Massive intervention, possibly exceeding Pounds
15bn, and two emergency interest rate increases, first to 12 per cent and
later to 15 per cent, had failed to save the pound.
The question facing the EC was whether the ERM and the strategic goal of
economic and monetary union by the end of the millenium could be saved from
the wreckage.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Electricity regulator's coal costing attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, provoked a storm
of criticism yesterday with publication of a report which concluded that
coal was the most expensive fuel for power generation.
The report, brought forward deliberately to coincide with the debate about
the future of coal, marks a serious setback for the coal lobby as it fights
the threat from competing fuels, mainly gas. But the report's chief
conclusions were rejected by the power generation industry.
Mr Colin Webster, commercial director of National Power, said he was
'utterly amazed' by Prof Littlechild's findings, which he described as 'a
nonsense and tendentious'. He said: 'We believe he has done his calculations
quite wrongly.'
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, the second largest generator sent
a letter to Prof Littlechild accusing him of putting together a rushed
report which failed to reflect the true position of the industry. An
official said: 'He seems to have conducted an analysis based on a wide
margin of error.'
British Coal, which has claimed that it is being unfairly squeezed out of
the market by the 'dash for gas', said: 'It has to be of concern to the
regulator that a large generation company is questioning his analysis.'
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, said the report failed to take
full account of fuel costs or the danger of overcapacity in gas-fired plant.
The Department of Trade and Industry said it would take account of Prof
Littlechild's conclusions but declined any detailed comment.
Prof Littlechild's main finding was that electricity companies had not
breached their duty to buy electricity as economically as possible in
signing gas-based deals. But to reach this conclusion he had to calculate
the relative contract price of different fuels. He gave these yesterday as
3.2p a kilowatt hour for coal, 3p for nuclear and 2.7p-3p for gas. National
Power said the correct figure for coal was 2.72p.
Prof Littlechild's report was welcomed by the electricity distribution
industry, whose members were relieved by his conclusion that they had
purchased power economically.
Gas producers also supported the report as evidence that the UK's gas lobby
is being heard. 'Frankly, it's very helpful,' said Mr Tony Craven-Walker,
chief executive of Monument Oil and Gas. Monumentis involved in a Pounds 2bn
project to develop four oil and gas fields in the Liverpool Bay area which
is dependent on PowerGen getting approval for its Connah's Quay gas-fired
power station.
A British Gas official said: 'It's interesting that this is a preliminary
report and we'll look forward to further findings at the end of January.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR told other European Community leaders yesterday that they must
strike a deal to make the Maastricht treaty acceptable to the Danish people
in order to free the EC from its current paralysis.
On the eve of a two-day European summit in Edinburgh, the prime minister
rejected suggestions by other leaders, notably President Francois Mitterrand
of France, that if no solution were found to the problem of Denmark's and
Britain's ratification of the treaty, the other 10 members could proceed
towards European Union on their own.
His warning came as it became clear that Spain, which wants significant
increases in fiscal transfers to poorer member states, was unwilling to
accept marginal new increases in the latest British budget proposals.
The new proposals were attacked last night as inadequate by Mr Jacques
Delors, European Commission president, who is pressing for a bigger
expansion of Community spending. There were signs, however, that Mr Major
might be ready to give some further ground if other EC leaders dropped their
demands for a reduction in Britain's rebate from Brussels.
Mr Major said in a series of television interviews that there could be no
question of a 'two-speed' EC. The treaty had to be ratified by all member
countries before it came into effect. They therefore had to reach an
agreement at Edinburgh which would be accepted by the Danes at a second
referendum.
Britain, which holds the EC presidency until the end of the year, has made
new proposals on Denmark and EC financing, considered to be the biggest
problems on the summit's agenda.
Faced with the refusal of their partners to make any amendments to the
treaty, the Danes want the EC to adopt a number of declarations which would
recognise their right to opt out of the proposed economic and monetary
union, a common defence policy, common interior and justice policies and EC
citizenship.
British officials said last night that it was not so much the substance of
the proposed declarations on Denmark, but their legal form, which was the
problem.
The latest proposals had gone some way towards satisfying Danish demands
that the special arrangements for Denmark, while not amending the treaty,
would nevertheless be considered as legally binding.
The officials recognised that the problem of EC financing would probably be
the hardest to solve and that, if it was settled at all, it would not be
until the end of the meeting tomorrow night.
Spain's demand, backed by Germany, for a higher 'own resources' ceiling for
the EC budget than that proposed by Britain is one of the biggest hurdles to
overcome.
Britain's new proposals, under which more cash would be channelled to the
poorer EC countries, such as Spain, Greece and Ireland, yesterday received a
cool initial reception from Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Yeltsin warns of coup threat: Russia in crisis as president
calls for referendum on who governs
</HEADLINE>

RUSSIA was plunged into crisis yesterday after President Boris Yeltsin
declared open political war on the Congress of People's Deputies, which has
blocked his reforms.
Citing a 'creeping coup' against him, Mr Yeltsin said a referendum was
necessary to decide 'to whom do you entrust saving the country from economic
and political crisis . . . the president . . . or the presently constituted
Congress and Supreme Soviet'.
In a dramatic speech to the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow, he
said: 'Congress is a bulwark of conservative forces and reaction. Reform in
Russia is in serious danger. What they failed to do in August 1991, they
have decided to repeat now by way of a creeping coup.'
His speech provoked uproar in the Congress Hall, the beginnings of scattered
demonstrations in the streets and the opposition of vice-president Alexander
Rutskoi.
General Rutskoi called for the prosecution of presidential advisers, whom he
accused of pushing Mr Yeltsin into a confrontation with the Congress and
into creating 'anarchy and powerlessness' in the country.
The president's proposal was for a referendum to be held on January 24. If
the population supported him, parliamentary elections would be convened on
March 27. If the Congress won the referendum, he would resign and fresh
presidential elections would be held. If neither secured the support of half
of those voting, both would stand for election. In the meantime, the
government would continue under the acting premiership of Mr Yegor Gaidar -
whom the Congress had refused to confirm in his post on Wednesday.
Both hardline deputies and presidential supporters reacted with anger. Calls
for Mr Yeltsin's impeachment were immediately raised. Mr Sergei Baburin, the
leader of the Russia nationalist faction, said: 'They are pushing us towards
revolution.' Mr Pyotr Fillipov, a prominent radical democrat deputy, told a
small demonstration in front of the Kremlin: 'The Civic Union (opposition
group) and the communists were pushing reform off the agenda - we must keep
it there by supporting the president.'
Mr Gaidar attempted to play down the significance of the event, saying the
president's action was wholly constitutional and that government business,
and talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, would
continue normally.
He said he had learned of the president's initiative only yesterday morning,
but admitted that he had asked Mr Victor Yerin, the interior minister, to
ensure public order.
The heads of the so-called 'power' ministries - defence, security and
interior - all appeared before the highly charged Congress to report, in a
scheduled discussion, on crime and corruption in the country.
General Pavel Grachev, defence minister, assured the Congress that the army
would remain above politics, but Mr Victor Barannikov, security minister and
head of the Russian KGB, produced a Soviet-era speech full of warnings of
the growing threat from foreign intelligence agencies and a rising tide of
crime.
Just before the close of business in the Congress, the deputies voted in
closed session to take back under their control a 300-strong armed guard.
This militia had been removed from Supreme Soviet to interior ministry
control last month by Mr Yeltsin, following its use by Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, in his attempt to seize the daily
paper Izvestia.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Britain and Spain rejoin final sprint for 1993 legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN, which holds the EC presidency, has rejoined the leading group in
the final sprint to put single market legislation into place before January
1.
Figures published by the European Commission yesterday will spare Britain
potential embarrassment at today's Edinburgh summit. They show that the UK
is no longer among the Community's legislative laggards. On the other hand,
Italy and Belgium are still among the slowest to pass single market
legislation through their national parliaments.
The triumphant opening of the single market at midnight on December 31 is
one of the aims of the British presidency, and EC leaders meeting in
Edinburgh are certain to declare that the market is effectively complete, in
spite of loopholes caused by delays and political compromises.
The leaders will also have to admit that one of the single market's
principal objectives - the lifting of border controls on people - will not
be fully achieved until the end of 1993, if then. Britain leads opposition
to abolishing passport checks.
EC directives cannot take effect until they are transferred into national
law, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC internal market commissioner, has
continually stressed the need for effective implementation.
After October 30 figures revealed that Britain, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium
and Italy were lagging behind their EC partners, Mr Bangemann wrote to their
governments urging them to accelerate the legislative procedure before
January 1.
Britain and Spain have both taken his complaints to heart.
According to figures compiled on December 8, they are now fifth and sixth in
the league table, compared with eighth and 12th in the October list.
Britain has transferred 81.2 per cent of the relevant measures, just above
the Community average. Denmark, which has consistently been the most
efficient at transferring legislation into national law, has tranposed 95.9
per cent of the laws.

FT  11 DEC 92 / UN may enforce no-fly zone, says Owen
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILITARY action may be needed to enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia if
efforts to secure compliance through negotiation fail, peace mediator Lord
Owen said yesterday.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, had been warned that if his
forces continued to flout the no-fly zone, imposed by the United Nations
last October, the UN security council would be called on to consider
enforcement, Lord Owen told a UK parliamentary select committee in London.
'The patience of the world is not limitless and the strengthening of
military action might be necessary,' he said.
Lord Owen said enforcement could still be achieved through negotiation but
if flouting of the ban continued 'despite constant warnings, we would be
forced to enforce it'.
Enforcement of the no-fly ban was the only military option the international
community should be considering at the moment, but it had to retain the
option of force to bring about a settlement in the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, cautioned yesterday over military
measures to enforce the no-fly zone. He told Nato colleagues that any action
against Serb helicopters or aircraft could endanger UN troops on the ground.
British officials indicated that the position was broadly supported by other
allies.
They added that no proposals had been put forward by defence ministers on
new ways of resolving or containing the Bosnian conflict.
Nato military authorities were undertaking preparatory work to ensure they
were better placed to respond to any new request from the UN to help the
peacekeeping effort. They said the political mandate for further action had
to come from the UN.
Moves to strengthen Nato's role in assisting peacekeeping efforts are to be
formalised by allied foreign ministers next week, including France.
US officials said yesterday it was unlikely that Washington would earmark
military units for peacekeeping.
Lord Owen told the select committee yesterday that the strength of feeling
in the Islamic world about the killing of Moslems in Bosnia should not be
underestimated. Substantial quantities of arms supplies had got through to
Moslems defending themselves against Serb forces, but these were mainly
light and unsophisticated weapons.
Bosnian foreign minister Haris Silajdzic said at peace talks in Geneva
yesterday he hoped US President-elect Bill Clinton would lift the arms
embargo on Bosnia.

<TEXT>
ANGOLA'S former rebel movement Unita yesterday said it would join a
government of national unity and return its forces into a new unified army,
but it urged the United Nations to send peace-keeping forces to Angola,
Reuter reports from Luanda.
A statement by the Unita leadership named appointees for the government and
military command offered it by the ruling MPLA last week.
The statement also reaffirmed the determination of Mr Jonas Savimbi, the
Unita leader, to take part in a second round presidential election and
demanded that the UN mediate all future disputes between Unita and the MPLA.
The statement named three little-known appointees to replace senior Unita
officials killed during the war with government forces last month in Luanda,
the Angolan capital.
General Antonio Sebastiao Dembo becomes vice-president of Unita; General
Eugenio Ngolo Manuvokola becomes secretary general and Brigadier Elias
Malungo Bravo da Costa Pedro was named as its new representative on a joint
commission overseeing last year's peace accord with the MPLA.
The Unita statement named Victorino Domingos Hossi as minister of culture.

FT  10 DEC 92 / EC seeks closer policy ties with eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is proposing to involve the EC's central European
allies in common European foreign policy-making.
It also wants to hold enlarged meetings of the EC Council of Ministers with
them on trans-European collaboration in energy, environment, transport and
telecommunications policy. The proposal, in a confidential Commission report
discussed by EC foreign ministers over lunch on Tuesday, will be put to the
12 heads of government at tomorrow's Edinburgh summit.
It goes further than before in trying to draw the Community's eastern
neighbours into European integration, and is clearly intended to signal that
the EC remains outward-looking despite the crisis over the Maastricht
treaty.
The root idea in the new Commission paper on eastern Europe retrieves EC
external affairs commissioner Frans Andriessen's 1991 proposal on associate
membership of the Community for east and central European states intending
to join the EC. The idea is to offer these countries a stake in the European
union foreseen by Maastricht, in advance of full membership.
The front-running EC candidates in central Europe - the Czechs, Hungarians
and Poles - are thought to need a decade more to restructure their economies
before they could assume the competition obligations of the EC's single
market.
In the meantime, the Commission paper argues that the EC must speed up their
access to its market for goods such as food, steel and textiles, in which
eastern Europe has a comparative advantage.
The Commission says the EC should formally accept the east Europeans as
applicants, arguing that this would stimulate economic reform and
investment, and 'discourage excessive nationalism'. The so-called 'Europe
accords' the EC has with Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, and which it is
exploring with Bulgaria, Romania and Albania, only state that these
countries see moves towards a free trade zone with the EC as a stepping
stone to membership.
The Commission advocates that the first three countries should be involved
in working groups and as observers at certain meetings of the 12 on foreign
policy. It suggests that this relationship could deepen as the EC develops a
fully-fledged common foreign and security policy as prescribed by
Maastricht.
The second main proposal is to let east European ministers sit in EC
councils discussing environment, transport and infrastructure policy of
common interest - though it hedges on whether they would be allowed to vote.
Mr Andriessen said on Tuesday these ideas were 'very well-received' by EC
foreign ministers.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (26): What users
said about their CAD systems - Computer aided design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSIDE this issue of of Software at Work we survey the market for computer
aided design software. This has expanded rapidly as computers become
cheaper, and a larger number of small companies are able to afford CAD
systems, writes Claire Gooding.
Our research has followed the usual Software At Work pattern, asking users
to tell us their stories and identify the pitfalls and business benefits of
acquiring CAD software.
One of the common grumbles of participants in Software At Work's CAD
research was 'performance.' PC users particularly resent waiting even a few
seconds, yet are probably unaware that, in terms of the power for the price,
they are more fortunate than minicomputer users of a few years ago.
Another complaint that occurred in all levels of user on all sorts of
hardware was a lack of 'user friendliness.'
The impenetrability of some CAD packages is probably explained by their
gradual evolution. As the need for specific features arises, the developers
add extra extensions. One user described this as 'sprawling.' It makes
finding specific features a challenge, rather like finding the right
department in a once-elegant building extended with Portakabins. No-one
admitted to knowing all the features of the package they were using.
Another feature of many interviews was the trust buyers put in a particular
value-added reseller (VAR), as a middle man between the end-user and
hardware and software vendors. VARS are often the first stop for advice and
support, and particularly tailoring, to provide menus of specific features.
The question of 'culture' loomed large in nearly all the interviews with
users. CAD technology, it seems, has to be introduced gently, and with great
tact, in order not to frighten and alienate people.
Inevitably, some users are more comfortable with the computer than others.
David Taffs of Ove Arup has identified a tendency for working groups to
develop their own, informal 'centres of expertise.'
One or two enthusiastic users become 'experts,' and all enquiries, (and
inevitably the actual work), gets channelled through them. The danger of
this pattern, especially in companies that do not invest in training, is
that the technophobes never acquire new computer skills: the culture cannot
spread beyond its small corner. This matters, for the point on which nearly
all respondents in our survey agreed was that CAD truly becomes valuable to
the entire organisation when it ceases to be standalone.
Linked with other disciplines - engineering, quality control, documentation
 -via multimedia and electronic data exchange, the CAD system comes out of
its corner and begins to pay back the expenditure.
All agreed was that the skill of the user was what really mattered.
Architects and engineers at Ove Arup (see report, page 11) and anywhere
else, need the skills of imagination, aggression, analysis and communication
first and foremost, before computer expertise.
The job of running the drawings off on the computer cannot be left to the
office whizz-kid 'who really understands computers,' because this keyboard
supremo probably lacks the experience to make the beautiful drawings
workable.
Whether dealing with rock stars (see report on Fisher Park, page 12) or
crane-operators on a site with awkward access, it is the vision and
experience of what can and can't work that matters. In CAD, as in any other
software application, the system is only a tool, or, as Jonathon Park of
Fisher Park, puts it: 'An electronic pencil.'

SOFTWARE is a management issue.
Nearly two years ago, Software At Work set out with this message, explaining
how technology was being used by individual businessmen and women to benefit
their businesses.
The product reviews contained in the seven issues to date have come from
live users of software products. Through extensive user interviews, stories
of successful (and struggling) business software users have been uncovered,
and through the accompanying 'consultants' critiques,' the reasons for
success (or failure) have been explained.
The Software at Work writing team now wants to hear from you. Below is a
list of areas covered in previous issues of Software At Work, (available on
request by calling FT Back Numbers in London on 071 873 3324) and a

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (23): Risks are
quickly assessed - Mortgage applications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TEBBUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROCESS of getting a mortgage was at one time helped enormously by the
rapport the borrower established with the lender. This would dictate how
much effort went into following up references and credit enquiries.
Nowadays, in the computer, the lender has a powerful ally in the battle
against fraudulent applications, taking over much of the work that used to
require human involvement. It can trigger automatic searches of remote
databases over the telephone lines without user intervention. Underwriters
can now assess risk, knowing that the computer has armed them with every
piece of information which they need.
One company which makes very sophisticated use of computing and
communications technology is the Household Mortgage Corporation. Using the
entries in the mortgage application form, its Assist Computer system can
immediately trigger enquiries into the personal circumstances of the
applicant.
By connecting to the Infolink Consumer Database, it can find out whether the
employer is doing well, whether the individual has a history of bad debt, or
whether they have a county court judgment against them.
HMC's own Unisys computer system holds information about how successful
loans have been to different types of borrower in the past. The company
plans to re-assess this information periodically, to ensure that emerging
behaviour patterns are being trapped. This knowledge is matched against the
searched information, the personal details (age, sex, present accommodation)
of the applicant and details of the loan, in order to assess the risk. When
all the information has been gathered and weighed by the computer, its
conclusions and supporting information are presented to the underwriter for
further interpretation.
Richard Anderson, head of underwriting at HMC, started thinking about the
possibilities of a new computer system in 1989 - 'we had a high standard of
underwriting, and we wanted to maintain this when the volume of business
rose again,' he says.
'Our industry has a history of great peaks and great troughs, but we cannot
staff for the peaks. We have to be consistently prudent, whatever the
business pattern. We want to check every mortgage application without
increasing the number of staff. Therefore, mechanical assistance was
needed.'
IN his search for a computer system which would meet the unusual needs of
his organisation, he found many packages which did part of the job but
nothing which matched exactly. In the end, he chose Infolink Decision
Services because it was prepared to build something specially for the
company. Infolink had built intelligent systems for other companies so it
understood HMC's requirements.
The on-line costs are minimal, compared with the amounts of money involved
in a loan, and although the company makes heavy use of Infolink, it still
pays on a search by search basis, the cost per search falling as the volume
rises.
The system has brought all the benefits expected, including an ability to
turn a loan application round in 24 hours. Mr Anderson considers all new
sources of electronic data as they become available.
For example, a historical voter's roll has now been developed, so it is easy
to check on how long applicants have lived at their current address. Land
registry records will prove invaluable once they become computerised. He
advises potential users of similar systems to be absolutely clear about what
they want to achieve before approaching the application developers and data
providers.
'There are no magic answers,' he says. With this kind of sophisticated
system, no-one is going to deliver it off-the-shelf.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (22): No longer
smothered by paper documents - Stockbroking applications / David Tebbutt
tells how stockbrokers Hoare Govett are moving away from data on paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TEBBUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORWARD-LOOKING companies have dispensed with their dusty libraries, and
even dustier librarians. In their place they have high-tech information
centres and information services managers.
The library function is, of course, still there. It has simply been enhanced
and improved by the addition of electronic, and therefore easily accessed,
information.
Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, was drowning in paper documents on the
business activities of thousands of companies. This had a number of
disadvantages. First of all, finding the exact record of interest was only
possible if its identity was already known. Searches could only be made by
company name, not by its attributes.
Other problems with paper-based systems include mis-filing. A mis-filed
record was lost for ever. Theft is perhaps too strong a word, but brokers
and analysts would often borrow paper records which would never be seen
again. And, of course, the costs of paper-based systems were high because of
the storage space and filing staff needed.
Hoare Govett's first move away from paper came when it started using
microfiche pictures of original documents. This was more a mechanical
process, but it did give a glimpse of the improved security, staffing and
space savings which were to come with the advent of CD-ROM and on-line
databases.
The company's first on-line systems were Datastream and Textline. Datastream
is a statistical database, covering companies, commodities, government and
economic statistics, while Textline contains synopses and full articles from
the world's press.
When the present information services manager, Janet Inglis, joined the
company in 1986, both systems were already running on dedicated terminals.
Later that year, Hoare Govett signed for its first on-line service, the
McCarthy press cutting service.
Previously McCarthy had provided press cuttings reproduced in card index
format. The Hoare Govett staff were quite resistant to the idea of
electronic information. They felt more secure with the familiar paper
documents. Even now, according to Mrs Inglis, they still hanker after the
cards.
More recently, information providers have begun to publish their less
frequently changing information on CD-ROM.
Mrs Inglis subscribes to these services if the data is going to be accessed
frequently. Her job is to weigh the cost of the CD-ROM service against the
cost of pay-as-you-go on-line services. In the case of Kompass and CD
Europa, for example, the CD-ROM option has been chosen. Twelve disks are
provided through the year and the two services cost Pounds 3,000 and Pounds
15,000 respectively. CD Europa provides Dun &amp; Bradstreet reports for the
whole of Europe.
OTHER CD-ROM information sources include: Disclosure - information on US
companies, SEC registrations, quarterly reports etc; Moody's International;
Standard and Poor's stock reports - historical information about share
price, dividend record, balance sheet and profit and loss; and Lotus One
Source - the IDD Mergers and Acquisitions database. Hoare Govett used to
take the IDD information on-line, but it was a long-winded process and the
telephone connection kept breaking.
The company also has a personal computer dedicated to the Amdata mergers and
acquisitions database. Once a month, Amdata squirts its updates over the
telephone where they are stored in the hard disk of this dedicated machine.
Monthly CD-ROM disks are preferred, however, because these take up a tiny
fraction of the room needed by a dedicated PC.
Hoare Govett uses a range of conventional on-line information services,
spending approximately Pounds 10,000 a year on Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Dunsprint
on-line service. This provides information on unquoted companies around the
world, especially north and south America, and is a useful way of finding
out about company subsidiaries.
For UK companies, because Companies House is just around the corner, it is
more convenient to use the Chorus on-line ordering service and a few minutes
of a messenger's time. For just Pounds 3, Mrs Inglis can obtain a microfiche
record of a company's memorandum and articles of association and at least
five years' worth of annual reports and other financial information.
FOR press information the company accesses Reuters' Textline through the FT
Profile service. Searches can be refined by subject matter, by industry and
by geography. The service provides very sophisticated search options and
delivers a list of headlines which meet the criteria. The user decides from
this list which articles or synopses should be downloaded to Hoare Govett.
The monthly cost of this service is Pounds 5,000, before any volume
discounts have been applied.
Other on-line services used include: Extel Workstation - historical company
financial information; Dialog - an umbrella, or host, service which gives
access to hundreds of databases through a consistent user interface. (While
this saves users from having to learn many different access methods, it does
result in a loss of flexibility, especially with a sophisticated system like
Textline); Thomson Financial Services' Investext - brokers' reports on
quoted companies; and Perfect Information - press cuttings, company news,
company circulars and press releases.
Perfect's services are unusual because they give users access to images of
the original documents. These are held on optical disc juke-boxes at Perfect
Data's premises. Because Perfect Information is used so heavily, Hoare
Govett accesses the service over a tied telephone line.
Datastream and Extel are accessed over tied lines for the same reasons. In
order to keep a control of the costs of these two services, the company pays
a flat rate for each one. Pay-as-you-go systems are best operated by skilled
users, otherwise costs can spiral out of control. The alternative is to pay
a fixed sum and let users do their worst.
As a rule of thumb, the power of the search tools is in inverse proportion
to the friendliness of the user interface. Datastream, which can be
difficult to use, can for example, provide sophisticated graphing facilities
based on the users' own equations.
Mrs Inglis would like to see the flat-rate and CD-ROM information services
delivered to the users' desktops across the company's networks. As people
move up the company they become more reluctant to use the keyboard, but the
Windows environment overcomes some of these difficulties. One of the
problems for users is that most information services differ in how the
information is accessed. There is a clear limit to how many different
methods the user can be expected to learn.
CD-ROM and on-line systems vastly increase the range of accessible
information, on offer, however, and this is their great advantage. ' At
Hoare Govett, for example, a research analyst wanted a breakdown of the
population of California by sex age and racial origins. Mrs Inglis knew of a
database that could help - Donnelly Demographics. She dialled in and within
five minutes delivered the information to an astonished analyst.
She points out that you cannot afford not to get what your competitors have
got. She also notes that electronic information can be downloaded easily
into spreadsheets and other documents. Some software packages are now
available which do all the work - they dial the service, download the
information and integrate it into your applications. Information Partners
from New Information Paradigms is a good example. On-line and CD-ROM
information frees up skilled library staff for much more sophisticated
information provision.
In the future, Mrs Inglis would like to connect these sources of information
directly into the company's computer networks. Instead of a printout,
information would be delivered directly to the user's screen. This kind of
service would enable the end users to become much more accurate and precise
in finding their own information.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (21): Afloat in a
rough sea - Leasing application / How on-line data helps reach balanced
underwriting decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TEBBUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH SO MANY companies going out of business or falling down on repayments,
it is not easy for a leasing company to choose the right customers, writes
David Tebbutt.
Schroder Leasing, which leases office and medical equipment, owes its
continued good health at least in part to its astute use of on line database
information.
'Not only does the information enable us to reach balanced underwriting
decisions, it has helped us to give our supplier network a more rapid
response to proposals,' says James McWattie, general manager. These benefits
have helped Schroder Leasing to maintain acceptable profitability through
one of the worst crises in the sales aid leasing business.
Mr McWattie uses financial, status and overview reports from ICC, depending
on the level of information needed. Financial reports include balance sheet,
and profit and loss.
Status reports give details of smaller companies, which do not have to file
full accounts. The financial or status report is accessed for deals in
excess of Pounds 10,000, while the overview report is generally sufficient
for smaller deals.
Another key source of information is the county court judgment database
which has recently been added to the ICC service. This often gives an
indication that something is going wrong in a company.
Once all the information is in, it is combined with other details such as
the type of business, how long it has been trading and the industry it is
in. Decisions can be made rapidly, providing the source information is
comprehensive and up to date.
BEFORE subscribing to the ICC service, Schroder Leasing relied on bank
reports, county court judgments and lower level reports from other
information providers and, sometimes, hard copy accounts which took up to 48
hours to arrive. The most-used report was Infolink's CMS4 which lists
financial transactions on a company's file. This information is supplied by
contributing members, such as finance houses and leasing companies.
These methods were slow and inaccurate. If Schroder Leasing wanted to go
into more detail on a company's circumstances, the delay could have meant
the competition getting the deal.
The recession has made it even more important to gain up-to-date
information, and was another factor in looking for a more effective way of
working.
ICC's on-line database information was the first step. The system currently
contains details on every single limited company, with full details on more
than 360,000. These company records cover some 70 per cent of Schroder
Leasing's business. It does, however, lack detail on sole traders and
partnerships, the remaining 30 per cent. For this type of client, the
company relies on UAPT Infolink and bank opinions.
Schroder Leasing chose ICC because it offers first class data at a
competitive price. Other on-line services and CD-ROMs considered were
rejected for being inaccurate, out of date or for containing details of too
few companies.
In addition to filtering out bad risks, the on-line services have allowed
Schroder Leasing to take on new business in risky sectors, by providing a
clear view of a potential client's financial performance.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (19): Information
at your fingertips - David Tebbutt examines the latest ways to access
business data via the computer terminal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TEBBUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMELY access to information can mean the difference between success and
failure, or life and death. At one extreme, the recent failures in the
ambulance service computer system in the UK show the serious consequences of
information loss. At the other end of the scale, a businessman may want to
find out as much as possible about a client before extending a line of
credit.
In a more leisurely age, a 48-hour wait for a photocopied document would not
have made much difference to a business relationship. Nowadays, a 48-minute
wait could result in the business going elsewhere.
The computer could well be the cause of life speeding up to today's hectic
levels. But it has also provided the tools to help cope with new demands
placed upon us.
Worldwide, direct-dial telephone networks have not only transformed our
ability to make contact, they have enabled computers to talk to each other,
too. Any information residing in any computer anywhere on this planet could,
theoretically, be passed to any other. The only requirement is a connection
into the ever-expanding international telecommunications web.
Many companies around the world have recognised the value of the information
they own and have made it available to computer systems and computer
terminal users. These on-line information services present callers with
menus on their computer screens from which they can call up information
which interests them.
You can, on a news clipping service, for example, ask for all mentions of
IBM, in the computer press, in western Europe, in the last three weeks. On a
financial data service, you might ask for IBM's financial results for the
last five years, and details of company officers during that period.
These on-line services are useful for both rapidly-changing and historical
information. Compact discs, just like those used to play music, hold huge
amounts of digital information. A dozen songs is about the equivalent of
600m characters of information. Not surprisingly, therefore, discs have been
seen as another publishing opportunity.
Historical and slow-moving information is well-suited to this medium, so a
regular information-browser might find it cheaper to get a year's worth at
one go on a single CD-ROM, rather than repeatedly use expensive on-line
databases. Some statistical data, such as the UK's 1981 Census, will never
change, so the CD-ROM publication is more like an interactive book. Some
CD-ROM publishers produce cumulative discs every month - or every three
months - leaving the user to go on-line for any data in the intervening
periods. The problem with all these different sources of information is that
each provider has its own access methods. But knowing how to use one
database is no guarantee that you can use another. To overcome this problem,
a number of companies have developed access systems which are consistent
across different databases. Subscribers to Dialog, for example, can gain
access to other providers' databases through the same interface. They may
not, however, be able to use some of the more esoteric functions, when
connected.
Some software companies will develop systems which automate access to remote
databases. They can be triggered by the addition of, for example, a new
prospect record. If the customer was an individual looking for a loan, the
computer system might check address details, current loans, county court
judgments, employer details, and so on. A lot of vital information can be
brought to the user's attention in this way.
None of these information products and services is cheap, although a
fifteen-month archive of The Independent at Pounds 299 sounds pretty good
value. If access is required only infrequently, the best advice is to sign
up for an umbrella service, such as Telecom Gold or Dialog, where payment is
for connection time to the service. Heavier users might instead subscribe
directly to the service and seek a discount on access charges.
Other ways of keeping costs down are to go for a fixed-fee, unlimited access
arrangement, to buy CD-ROMs or to get periodic downloads of information
directly into hard disk drives.
Another area of expense is the telephone line. For heavy users, a dedicated
line direct to the information provider may be worth while. The trick is to
be as clear as you can about your information requirements before looking
for a service, and then to make sure that any deal can be changed, should
requirements alter.
If competitors are using on-line and CD-ROM services to improve performance
of their core business, then others have no choice. If they are not using
the services, or are using them unimaginatively, then this is an opportunity
to get one jump ahead.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (20): Drawings at
high speed - Architectural applications / CAD, User Views
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE work for the car industry and when they want something, they want it
right away,' says Mr Alexander Evans, partner in the Coventry-based
architects Hellberg Harris Partnership, who realised four years ago that in
order to produce and adapt their drawings very quickly, the 10-strong
company needed CAD technology. 'We wanted something to help us produce
drawings, adapt them, and prototype so that we could 'walk through' designs
with clients.'
Computervision, Intergraph and AutoCAD were on too grand a scale or not
close enough to architectural needs for the partnership. They wanted
something intuitive and GUI-based and found that the Architrion package,
hosted on the friendly Macintosh computer, met a all their needs.
'We chose Architrion because it is designed for architects and by them,'
comments Mr Evans. 'It works in the way we think.'
Consultancy How and Marshall (now KRCS) supplied Architrion II version 5.5,
running on a pair of Mac IIs, running 19-inch mono and colour monitors -
about Pounds 4,000 each - plus another Pounds 4,000-worth of printers and
plotters. The entire system was installed for Pounds 20,000 and has been
kept up to date with software upgrades and such extras as the Codec
estimating and pricing software. Another advantage of taking this
comparitively cheap route was the integration inbuilt in the Mac host:
information can be swapped between word processing and desktop publishing
applications - 'we can also take measurements from a disc from surveyors,
for example, through the DXF translator.'
Mr Evans is clear about the advantages: 'It's made us more efficient. We've
obtained and retained clients just by offering a quick service. The
interesting thing is that the client has a choice: we can do the job faster
at a cheaper rate, or charge the same for a more in-depth work. Without
exception they choose the cheaper route.'
Friar House, Coventry, (see picture on back page) was developed with 3D 'as
built' drawings, allowing high speed communication between consultants and
clients, before plans are finalised.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (17): How to see
through a dark glass lightly - Manufacturing user view / A new design makes
a better impression in the right setting. CAD software has helped United
Glass improve its presentation.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A new design makes a better impression in the right setting. CAD software
has helped United Glass improve its presentation. THE BOTTLES in which you
buy gin, beer or babyfood are 'fashion items' to the people who make them.
United Glass, a Pounds 177m company in St Albans, Hertfordshire, designs and
manufactures bottles for Guinness' Kaliber, and Heinz babyfoods, among other
customers.
'For 30 or 40 years, we've manufactured glass containers, but these days
glass is basically a fashion medium,' explains Ian Peake, design service
manager at United Glass. 'So much so that we couldn't go on selling using
two-dimensional drawings: we had to do something about our presentation and
visualisation to secure tomorrow's business.'
United Glass wanted a CAD product that related directly to glass design, so
it used a 'benchmark' project of a design to send to eight or so software
suppliers, including Prime, McDonnell Douglas, Intergraph, and others - 'our
priorities were presentation, accuracy, dedication, speed. It's important to
represent and render the true geometry of the bottles so that we can't
design something we can't make.'
Mr Peake discovered that the IDEAS product from SDRC was able to drive the
model using true dimensions, and also render the picture art speed.
High-speed visualisation was a must when presenting to clients, and some of
the other options lost out on their lack of speed, and the fact that they
needed dedicated proprietary hardware.
Communications Arts, a specialist in visualisation systems, won the Pounds
0.5m contract. It designed, installed and integrated the entire system,
using 18 Silicon Graphics workstations, two personal Iris computers and 15
Iris Indigos, plus print and plotting hardware from HP, Tektronix and Iris.
The main IDEAS software modules in use are the Wavefront Advanced
Visualiser, for rendering, animation and presentation, and the Alias Full
Color design and publishing system. The scope of the system reaches far
beyond the moving of presentation models in real time. There are links to
production systems to create moulds, and links to the sales and marketing
systems which produce pictures ready-made for glossy brochures.
As well as integrating all the CAD products so that they could exchange data
and dimensions, Communications Arts produced a number of 'scenarios.' United
Glass users can pick a number of scenes from a menu, and demonstrate the
designs to clients 'in situ,' with the backdrop of a pub interior,
supermarket or kitchen. These scenes can be 'edited' and adapted by users.
They also have a menu from which they can pick from a range of glass colours
and transparencies, with bottle contents ranging from ketchup to whisky in
viscosity.
SPEED is still an issue, given the complexity of the images produced by the
system - 'basically we binned everything we had and started from scratch. It
has taken a year, and we've spent Pounds 1m integrating with the mainframe,'
explains Mr Peake. 'It's really only when you take something on board and
use it that you discover such limitations as the size of files.'
Nevertheless, he declares himself 80 per cent satisfied with the system.
His words of warning to others researching CAD is to be wary of
salespeople's claims, especially regarding performance. 'Expectations can be
too high: we learned a a great deal in the process.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (16): Smarter way
of working - Aircraft design / Three-dimensional models can now be made in
hours, rather than weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVANCES in technology at Short Brothers, one of the oldest aircraft
manufacturers in the world, no longer come in leaps and bounds as they did
in the days of wood and canvas.
But things do happen faster, writes Claire Gooding. The CAD system used by
Shorts has reduced the time taken to produce the mock-up of a wing from a
few weeks to a few hours.
Shorts, founded in 1909 and now owned by Bombardier (quoted on the Canadian
Stock Exchange), employs 8,700 people and has a turnover of Pounds 395m. In
a fiercely competitive business, it looks for an edge wherever it can find
one and it introduced CAD technology 10 years ago, choosing CADDS from
Computervision, in line with Boeing.
'As with all aerospace companies, we were looking for an edge: smarter ways
of doing business, faster turnaround, better reactions, and dealing with
changes faster,' says Mr Dennis Barritt, the CAD-CAM manager at Shorts.
'Better-quality products was the key: everyone jumps on the quality
bandwagon, but you're not in the business unless you produce a quality
product that users can afford and know is reliable.'
In his three years at Shorts, Mr Barritt has learned that technology is not
the problem - 'the big thing is not software or hardware. I would say 75 to
80 per cent of the effort goes into the change of culture.'
At the time, Shorts assessed all the leading offerings and decided in favour
of a turnkey solution. Considerations were the cost of ownership, and the
support available from the supplier: the software had to be tailored. A
decade later, the system has 'migrated' from its mainframe host.
Computervision's CADDS software now runs on 130 Sun work stations and is
linked directly into the production process.
EDM (electronic data management) has become ingrained in the way that Shorts
communicates internally - 'we can receive work from others, via data
translators, and we are looking at dealing direct with partners elsewhere in
the group.'
Mr Barritt has seen the process of design speeded up through the use of CAD,
practically eliminating the dependency on physical mock-ups.
'Initially, it was an electronic drawing board, used for producing
two-dimensional sheet metal patterns,' he explains. 'These days you're only
limited by your vision. We are moving towards digital pre-assembly,
generating a 3D model in a matter of minutes where it used to take a week.'

clear objectives - Engineering application
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAD software was initially bought as an engineering and drafting tool at
Hotpoint, the UK manufacturer of white goods. But now, according to David
Ellis, IT co-ordinator, 'it is an enabling-tool to improve the design to
manufacture process.'
Eight years ago the company chose Intergraph's EMS engineering modelling
system.
When a review looked in 1990 at alternative offerings from Computervision,
IBM and HP, Hotpoint decided that it still had the right tool, and stayed
with EMS. It now runs EMS, MicroStation, project layout and associated
desktop publishing products on a network of Intergraph UNIX workstations and
servers.
'There were many excellent solutions available, but CAD must be seen as an
integral part of the IT strategy, not an isolated tool, to get the maximum
benefit,' says Mr Ellis.
Hotpoint was looking for several different levels of integration - not just
in-house, but in dealing with third parties without having to translate. It
also put a high rating on useability and friendliness.
The system has now percolated most areas of Hotpoint, and plays a part not
only in the design, but in the manufacture, and even the user manuals
provided with Hotpoint's fridges, washing machines and dishwashers. There
are now links with the MRP manufacturing software, and with the CNC
numerical control systems in Hotpoint's Welsh factories in Rhyl and
Gwynnedd.
Mr Ellis stresses that the benefits have not been solely in the design
improvements attributable to CAD software, but in the new approaches that
its use has brought. His advice to others is that 'companies should look at
the processes, the people, and then at the technology as an enabler.' CAD
should help to develop and improve the effectiveness of individuals, and
also benefit and improve the process itself.
Too often, he warns, the implementation of CAD software fails because the
objectives have not been fully understood - 'the goals have to be defined
properly,' he concludes.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (15): Lansing gets
it right first time - Manufacturing View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEING 'right first time, more often' was the aim of Lansing Linde in
acquiring its CAD software. Lansing, based in Basingstoke and employing
2,000 people, is a well-known name in the manufacture of warehouse handling
equipment, particularly lift trucks, writes Claire Gooding.
It was a privately owned company known as Lansing Bagnall until its
acquisition in 1989 by the German company Linde, which specialises in
counter-balanced engine trucks.
'What we were looking for was the flexibility of bringing products to the
marketplace more quickly', explains Brian Cayley, senior executive engineer.
In 1983 the company assessed around 50 suppliers of CAD software, from
mainframe to PC hosts.
By the time Linde bought Lansing in 1989, there was already substantial
investment in two products: Computervision at Lansing, and Intergraph at
Linde. There are 12 Intergraph seats and 18 Computervision seats currently
in use. Rather than start from scratch, the company aimed to integrate its
existing software in a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) strategy
embracing CAD, CAM, CAPP, MRP and shop floor control systems. It chose CPlan
from CADCentre as the next step in Computer Aided Process Planning. Chassis
manufacture was selected for the trial as the most complex and variable
component.
CADCentre's contract, worth Pounds 90,000, included hardware, training, and
support. The CPlan software was first installed in 1988 and currently
supports 12 seats running on Sun workstations. The trial has been so
successful that the techniques learned in implementing CIM are to be used in
a new manufacturing plant being built in Basingstoke.
Four years ago, it took 12 weeks to complete the product after receiving an
order. Now, with the help of CPlan's CAPP techniques, it takes only four
weeks.
Lansing takes integration seriously. It has a direct Electronic Data
Management (EDM) link with its Blackwood plant, and its CAD facilities are
linked with its MRP and manufacturing packages, its machine control, and
even its technical publications.
'We take a wide view of the benefits', says Mr Cayley. In his opinion,
companies investing in 3D software should look for more than an increase in
drawing productivity, however dramatic. 'There are tremendous productivity
benefits in going from 2D to 3D, but you can find find yourself in a trap:
it doesn't necessarily better design. The current convention is to produce a
drawing, but CIM involves more than that.'
He points to several benefits in having invested so much in technology - 'it
gives us the ability to explore alternatives quickly, and to optimise our
designs. With the levels of ever-closer integration, we are going down the
road of parallel engineering.'

ARCHITECTS at Yakeley Associates need high quality graphical presentations
to impress a varied customer base. In the public sector alone, Yakeley's
tasks can vary from the refurbishment of an office block to the creation
from start to finish of a Pounds 45m courthouse.
Like many architectural firms, Yakeley faced the problem of productivity.
With a staff of 18 and a turnover of about Pounds 700,000, the company saw
computer-aided design as a way of increasing efficiency and improving
presentation skills, without having to spend a crippling amount on
technology.
Just as important was the time and effort that would have to be invested in
learning, so easy-to-use software was a high priority.
'The advent of the Macintosh made the technology affordable for us,'
comments town planner Ian Kime.
'We originally bought our Mac for word processing, but started to invest in
drawing packages.'
Yakeley looked at Macdraft, and other contemporary offerings, including
AutoCAD and Architrion, but settled for a US-based package, MiniCAD. The
Yakeley team was unimpressed by what it saw as unnecessary complexity.'
He adds: 'The MiniCAD package was straightforward, and used the Mac
interface very well. In addition, it was one-quarter the price of anything
else we looked at.
'Since we installed the system in 1986, the software has developed and we
have also developed with it. The primary aim is to get the lines on the
paper as cheaply and efficiently as possible - nothing else really matters.'
THE Yakeley users are all self-taught novices, more at home with the
Architects Journal than the computer trade press. However, Ian Kime has been
quick to spot ways in which the use of CAD software can further benefit the
practice.
'Compatibility is critical in relation to the construction industry today,'
he says. 'The one thing we have to do is to talk electronically with other
consultants, exchanging drawing files with structural engineers and
consultants.'
MiniCAD allows them to exchange data through a Data Exchange Facility, DXF,
so that details of drawings can be taken off disc, worked on, and returned
in their original for mat. This saves errors in copying, and time in
reproducing data.
Although MiniCAD has speeded up the production of drawings, especially when
dealing with features that are repeated many times in one building, its
benefits have been much more widespread. They include the ability to target
and present services better, for example in the customisation of brochures
produced for a particular market sector.
'We have expanded our range of services,' says Mr Kime. 'We don't wait for
people to knock on our door, we take a pro-active approach, developing the
client's needs, defining them, and developing the brief with the client.
Essentially, the computer allows us to prototype buildings.
His colleague Mr Yeates agrees that there have been benefits in focusing the
architects' talents on the client's specific needs. 'We can now model all
the important parameters, and suggest the best building for the particular
conditions, focusing on the particular needs of that site or contract.
'Also, the technology affects the discipline and working procedures, keeping
track of who is working on what.
'Productivity is greater - which is good for our clients - because we can
produce more drawings for the same price.'

sketching, designing and building a stage set for a musical event. But it's
all change at the last minute if the massive design doesn't have the right
'feel' for the megastar client once it is built, regardless of cost and
wasted effort.
At the office of Fisher Park in Kings Cross, London, the details stored on
its small network of CAD screens are essential to the fast turnaround of
their work. They enable the company to adapt existing designs, pull in the
details of various stadium venues, and test the designs for 'buildability'.
In Fisher Park's somewhat off-beat line of business, fantastic ideas have to
be translated into workable, often mobile, structures. These have to be
built with regard to public safety regulations - and, just as important,
they must be designed to be broken down, packed into a truck, transported,
and rebuilt within the strictures of the next venue, wherever that is,
without exhausting the production crew.
'Although we call ourselves 3D designers,' says Mr Park, director, 'We are
really architects working in rock and roll. We deal with the client, take
the brief, visualise it, supervise the construction and implementation. We
are very much leaders and drivers of the project, although we're invisible
on the night.'
Their CAD system, Autodesk's AutoCAD running on a small PC network, is used
as an 'electronic pen', speeding up some of the tedious but precise design
work needed to realise the sketches resulting from brainstorming sessions
with the rock star.
Further down the line, they have to fulfil the normal duties of an
architect, providing working details to the crew who have to build and break
down the set and lighting equipment.
Fisher Park is the stage-set design company for rock concerts and
world-touring megastars. A newly-published book charts the progress of their
work: Sutherland Lyall's Rock Sets is full of photographs and CAD drawings
of such rock spectacles as Roger Waters' The Wall in Berlin, all designed by
Fisher Park.
Things have changed since the early days in 1966 when the Beatles played at
the Shea stadium in New York, packed with screaming fans who could hardly
see them. The current vogue for son et lumiere extravaganzas calls for a
combination of inspirational and practical design skills, plus the ability
to get on with temperamental rock stars. Something has to happen on stage
all the time to entertain and dazzle the audience.
Fisher Park has practically defined the business of mounting spectacular
live events. They met at (and still lecture for) the Architectural
Association. As a partnership, the pair has brought the professionalism of
mechanical and structural engineering to an essentially ephemeral,
theatrical business.
Having stumbled into it by accident with the rock group Pink Floyd in 1977,
their credits now include Pavarotti in the Park, Tina Turner's Foreign
Affair European tour, U2's Zoo TV Outside Broadcast US Stadium tour, and the
Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels tour.
It was Mick Jagger, the Stones' lead singer, who wanted a last-minute change
in their Urban Jungle set: overnight it was transformed from a green jungle
into a backdrop for a ravening dog.
The problem for Fisher Park is that the process of designing the sets is
very labour-intensive, and calls for a peculiar combinations of talent.
The process starts with a brainstorming session, which produces pen-and-ink
sketches, illustrating styles, narratives and thematic ideas, sometimes
produces from little more than a vague 'feel' or suggested atmosphere.
'The skill at this stage is in the sketches and the visualisation,' says Mr
Park. 'Our job is the technical realisation of the artiste's ideas. He or
she is the only begetter and creator. It is true that we can lead our
clients up paths they might never have explored, because we have experience
of the possibilities. But we also know the technical requirements and
limitations of touring and performing.'
Stage two involves design drawings such as technical elevations, and the
third stage has to provide working details. These must be precise for such
contractors as Scena and Brilliant Stages, London-based companies who
provide the building, electrical, lighting, carpentry and painting skills to
realise the designs.
The sets may cost between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m but still represent only a
fraction of the production costs.
The team works closely with production experts on details of the tour
schedule and the needs of the crew in build and break-down phases. 'We all
work together as a team: we are the invisible member of it. If we don't
produce something workable, the stage crew will simply edit the set by
leaving parts of it behind as the tour proceeds.
'If they feel they own it - that they're part of the culture and the project
 -then they'll want to preserve the integrity of the idea.'
Using AutoCAD, the first two stages of design can take place more or less
simultaneously. As the sketches evolve from the ideas stage, they can be
drawn on screen and tested for practicality.
Another advantage is that the system can store a vast catalogue of re-usable
modular elements, such as Varilite searchlights which Fisher-Park first used
at the Seville Expo. The objects can be manipulated to fit new designs,
saving hours of detailed drawing time.
At one time, the company was tempted to try out Macintosh computers, but
decided to wait until AutoCAD, which they see as the standard architectural
computer tool, was available in 3D.
The company did not get computers until 1988 and now runs a three-seat
installation using Autocad release 11 - including desktop publishing
facilities - on Dell and Compaq work stations. They are planning to graduate
to release 12. Autodesk's 3D studio software allows them to animate the
designs.
Mr Park already had some experience of CAD software in his career at Ove
Arup. 'One issue was technical backup and reliability. It was reassuring
that AutoCAD had the biggest user base and a large user group. Many of the
drawbacks that had deterred us from computerising before were overcome in
later releases of the software.'
The main advantage has been in providing an extremely fast response to
ideas, but as Mr Fisher explains, the employment of technology has to be
appropriate.
'The drawings are only information. We have always produced more
comprehensive drawings because of our backgrounds. In fact, a hand sketch
can be more evocative because you're only limited by your talent and
imagination, it's not a matter of affording the technology. The computer is
only a tool to help you design: it's not a panacea, no substitute for a good
idea.'
Even as a workaday tool the software has its uses, for example imposing the
discipline of perspective. The company provides a professional engineering
approach, and the depth of detail. As with less transitory architecture,
each set is inspected and signed off at every stage. Its competitors -
largely from theatrical backgrounds - use computers, but not as a design
tool.
Fisher Park uses the 'struggle before you ask' principle, never having
attended an AutoCAD training course. They refer to the two-inch thick
manual, and rely on a friendly consultant firm Deus Ex Machina to provide
tailoring and comforting menus, the main complaint being that AutoCAD is so
complex that it is unfriendly, even for an habitual user.
The CAD images have been used with fully rendered computer animation to
produce a video based on the U2 rock spectacular. This acts as a showcase
for Fisher Park's skills: they would like to explore arenas beyond rock and
roll.
On a more mundane level, the software allows them to produce A4 images that
can be faxed to clients. As other organisations become CAD users, Fisher
Park finds further benefits. Now it can exchange AutoCAD details with the
lighting company Samuelsons, or pull in ready-made flatplan survey details
from another contractor, as they did for Seville Expo.
But the real pay-off is that the two directors are now able to manage the
workload without lots of staff producing technical drawings - 'in 1989 we
got rid of six drawing boards and put in three computers,' recalls Mark
Fisher. 'Now two of us do all the graft, and maintain a huge output. It's
easier to show people what we're talking about, and we can produce detailed
drawings very efficiently, but I couldn't say that's why they come to us.
They buy our ability to design, not to use computers.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (6): Rapid route to
creativity - Claire Gooding looks at the origins of computer aided design
and how the latest systems are cutting the cost of technical design for
industry / Computer aided design
</HEADLINE>

MOST computer users have PCs, workstations, or terminals: users of computer
aided design (CAD) systems have 'seats.' While the computer world has a
language all its own, the CAD world has a dialect more baffling than most
(see buzzwords, below).
Largely used by engineers, architects and designers, the measurement of CAD
systems in seats goes back to the time when they were extremely expensive
and demanded the purchase of dedicated hardware that would be unlikely to
perform any other task.
As the term implies, a 'seat' could be shared between several occupants,
highly-qualified people who would have to acquire another skill, that of
using a computer.
In the early 1980s, CAD was 'standalone.' The hardware and software were
'dedicated,' and their users were in a world of their own. Presenting a
picture on a screen was a heavy task for a computer: manipulating and
rotating it involved the constant high-speed re-calculation of co-ordinates.
In the past this was mainframe work, or at least involved a dedicated
minicomputer. Suppliers such as Prime, ICL, with Perq systems and Apollo,
with Domain systems dominated a small and specialist market.
Now there is a much wider marketplace, reflected by its own thriving trade
press (see references, page 10) and a trade show now in its ninth year -
CADCAM 93, at Birmingham NEC from March 9th-11th, 1993, has already
attracted more than 200 exhibitors. It includes software, hardware,
services, and peripherals - another specialised CAD area because plotters
for A1-size paper are unlikely to be used with any other application.
The dominant names are now Autodesk, which has its own 'expo' at the show,
and Sun Microsystems, the supplier of workstations, with its own 'village.'
Cambashi, a Cambridge consultancy which specialises in computer-aided
technologies and market research, identifies Autodesk, EDS, Hewlett Packard,
IBM and Intergraph among the leading vendors (see table, page 10). The
market is still concentrated in the hands of a handful of companies, in
terms of products purchased.
Cambashi also identifies a more complex marketplace, where middle-men and
value-added resellers (VARs) play a much larger part in sales. It estimates
that in 1991, end-users in the UK spent Pounds 445m on CAD systems; about
half on hardware, and the remainder split more or less equally between
software and services. This is some advance on the mid-eighties, when an
internal IBM report on CAD marked the UK behind Sweden in the number of CAD
installations.
With falling hardware prices, CAD has been able to reach a larger
marketplace. Large users such as Ove Arup, the engineering consultancy which
developed its own CAD software at one time, have seen the price plummet,
from around Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 6,000 per seat, in a few years.
Rising maintenance charges on old kit fuels the spend on new, more powerful
and essentially cheaper systems.
Jenny Jacobsberg, consultant at Cambashi, makes a distinction in her
measurements of CAD usage between penetration, (the number of companies
buying CAD units), and 'saturation', the number of skilled people within the
company using the system.
By the end of 1991, there were 67,000 installations, (compared to 35,500
four years ago), with a potential 300,000 end-users: a saturation of 22.3
per cent. Applications using only two dimensional (2D) representation are
stagnating, those using 3D are on the increase.
'The UK still has long way to go when it comes to spreading the usage inside
the company' she says. 'To get to the stage where every user has a
workstation dedicated to them alone, there will have to be a significant
change of culture.'
It is still rare to find large-scale projects like Ove Arup's Glaxo campus,
relying entirely on CAD, with one workstation per worker.
The advent of the PC changed people's expectations: they wanted faster,
smarter, easier-to-use systems. Many Macintosh and PC-based solutions have
enabled smaller companies to use CAD for the first time. The edges have even
become blurred about what is - and isn't - CAD.
If it's friendly and easy to use, it may not qualify as CAD, which tends to
be associated with professional mysteries - 'anything that smacks of CAD
frightens people,' says Mick Pitt, managing director of a company called
Scimus whose Doodle product has been used in everything from lace design to
fire reports and graphics of car crashes in insurance claims.
'The actual skills needed for technical design are quite high and
time-consuming. We're trying to get people to understand that they needn't
be frightened of making mistakes, they can change and reproduce things at
will on the screen. Some people dispute that Doodle is a CAD product at all,
but we see it as a link between CAD and desktop publishing, accessible to
everyone from seven years old upwards.'
Rather as the telephone, and more recently, the fax machine, gained in value
as more and more people adopted the technology, CAD systems start delivering
real value as more and more people use them. Users can swap dimensions,
drawings, and volumes of information whose accuracy is vital to the job, via
exchange of floppy discs, through the standard IGES (Initial Graphics
Exchange Specification) transfer mechanism, or through EDM (electronic data
management).
This facility is so important that it has spawned a centre of expertise in
Leeds: CADETSI (CADCAM Data Exchange Technical Centre). Standards, an issue
that flickers and burns constantly throughout the computer industry, is
already a concern among CAD users.
'It depends on the company' says Jenny Jacobsberg. ' The bigger the
organisation, and the more customers or suppliers they deal with, the more
important standards will be. Another factor in the exchange of information
within one company is a mixture of hardware platforms and software packages.
A smaller company which gone down the PC or IBM-specific route might find it
less of an issue.'
In specific industries, such as the automative industry, the move towards
EDM has forced most suppliers down a standard route. Which 'standard'
product they acquire, IBM's Catia or Computervision's CADDS product, will be
dictated by their customer. The whole industry has moved forward through
collaboration and agreement. The Husat Research Institute (Human Sciences
and Advanced Technology) is involved in two such projects: RACE (Research
and Development on Advanced Communications in Europe) and CAR, (CAD/CAM in
the Automative Industry in RACE).
In the architecture market, AutoCAD has achieved such penetration that it is
spawning any number of independently produced add-ons and extensions. Yet,
says Mrs Jacobsberg of Cambashi, 'there is no such thing as an industry
standard.'
There are however, favoured solutions in different vertical markets - 'there
is an increasing requirement for industry-specific solutions, so vendors
have identified the opportunities and are coming up with tailored packages.'
Not surprisingly, the computer industry itself has been among the first to
recognise and use the potential. Hewlett Packard, for instance, uses
Genrad's SYSHILO products in the development of its latest Integrated
Circuits, to model, simulate and verify these complex components before
actual implementation.
Users are beginning to realise that computer aided design is just the tip of
the iceberg. Connected with other technologies - including quality control,
robotics, and recently, with desktop publishing, (see case study on United
Glass, page 16) - CAD can remove many of the overheads (but not the skills)
of creativity.

EDM: Engineering Data Management, also known as Electronic Data Management,
or Engineering Document Management: a software tool to manage all product
definition data (specifications, engineering drawings, analysis results,
process plans, various image.)
EDM helps in the passing of information between customers, suppliers, and
vendors enabling various partners in the production chain to exchange any
relevant data in a speedy, error-free format.
CAD,CADD: Computer Aided Design, or Computer Aided Design and Drafting:
these are software tools used for design for mechanical, electrical,
architectural, mapping, and other such applications.
SEATS: CAD installations are usually referred to as 'seats,' (eg a 10-seat
system) because workstations are rarely used on a one-per-desk ratio: the
'seat' is generally a shared resource, being used by several different
people within a workplace.
CAM: Computer Aided Manufacturing software programs a wide range of shop
floor machinery and plant to do actual physical tasks such robotic welding.
This includes Numeric Control, which uses a tape of repetitive instructions
to drive the machine, Computer Numeric Control, which allows for the use of
variable data, and DNC, Direct Numeric Control, which is fully automated,
allowing for the use of different tools in one complex task.
CAPP: Computer Aided Process Planning, manufacturing methods operations
times and production costs for each step in a product's manufacture, and
forms the essential information links between design, capacity scheduling
and production control.
CAE: Computer Aided Engineering, is the process of applying software and
computer tools to solve engineering problems, essentially engineering
analysis, including optimisation, simulation, and other processes built on
numeric calculations.
CIM: Computer Integrated Manufacturing is the use of computers in every
stage of the manufacturing process, where information is passed
automatically from one function to another, for example, from a CAD design
of a chair to the tool used to bolt its parts together, thence in to billing
and financial systems, stock control, and even into user manuals.
DXF: Drawing Exchange Format, Data Exchange Format, refers to the de facto
standard among users of microcomputer based graphic systems, based on the
AutoCAD product.
IGES: Initial Graphic Exchange Specification was meant to be the standard
for free translation of drawing between systems, but become too
all-embracing to be easily implemented and used: many PC users find DXF more
convenient.
MRP: Materials Requirement Planning was one the earliest uses of production
management and control, MRP II, Manufacturing Resources Planning, plans the
complete logical sequence of production including the purchase of components
from suppliers.
PDGS: Prime Design Graphic System was developed by Ford and Computervision
for the surface modelling of car bodywork.

BRITANNIA Building Society has one of Europe's largest DIP installations
(pictured above) with more than 113 workstations, enabling 300 staff to
access the system at different levels.
Britannia uses an Olivetti Systems and Networks (OSN) FileNet DIP system to
automate what had been 'paper-intensive' mortgage-processing. WorkFlo
software systems are allowing Britannia to design and 're-engineer' business
processes and increase office productivity by 25 per cent. Britania's system
redevelopment programme involves 12 departments, starting with mortgage
insurance administration, earlier this year. The system will also cover
account changes, redemptions, deeds movement, mortgage administration and
arrears. Once information is scanned into the system, automated document
retrieval takes only a few seconds, allowing staff to take on more important
transactions, rather than time-consuming admin tasks.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (4): Document
storage systems compared - John Kavanagh looks at the options from optical
and magnetic disc systems to computer-output microfilm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICROFILM still has a place in business but the emergence of computer-based
document processing systems means its role will be confined to long-term
archiving.
This is the view of Kodak, which builds both types of document storage
system. Its view is backed by consultants and suppliers of systems based on
optical disc storage.
'The computer-output microfilm business is growing by five per cent a year,
but this is mainly from existing users expanding their systems rather than
from new users,' says Mr Colin Cooke, a manager in Kodak's UK Office Imaging
operation.
'Microfilm is best if the application is truly archival, with very low
retrieval demands. Here it is very cheap and lasts 100 years or more without
deteriorating. In addition, so far it is the only alternative to the
original document that has been accepted in a court.'
Mr Cooke says the insurance industry is a typical user of microfilm, because
it needs to keep documents such as those relating to life insurance for very
many years.
At the other end of the scale is magnetic storage associated with computers.
Magnetic tape has been used for archiving but the quality of the storage can
be at risk after seven or eight years. Access is far from instant: tapes
have to be retrieved from a store and run through from the start until the
required records are found.
Magnetic discs offer virtually instant access but at high cost and, as with
tape, the quality deteriorates. Colin Cooke says magnetic disc systems cost
seven times more than optical discs systems in terms of the storage
equipment alone.
Optical discs are a compromise between microfilm and magnetic discs.
Retrieval times are slow by computing standards, although documents are
nonetheless brought to the screen in five to 20 seconds, depending on
factors such as the number of documents on a disc and the number of discs
and drives in a juke box.
The life of optical discs is put at between 30 and 50 years, although they
have not been around long enough for this to be proved in live use. Their
long life, compared with that of magnetic discs, is not least due to the
fact that the unit which writes and reads data to and from the disc uses a
laser beam and therefore never touches the disc surface. The original
optical discs could only be recorded on once but recent years have seen the
emergence of discs on which data can be erased or overwritten.
There are mixed views on whether the benefits of this advance. If the data
can be erased these optical disc systems could be considered as rivals to
traditional magnetic discs, with massive capacity in a smaller box and at
far less cost. Their disadvantage here is their retrieval times, w hich are
far too slow for every-day data processing.
Colin Cooke at Kodak is among those who believe the very fact that the
original optical disc systems recorded data only once was one of their main
benefits. 'One of their attractions lies in their key feature of providing
permanent, stable storage,' he says.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (3): Office staff
move into high gear - Case study / New document image processing system
replaces paper files on 52,000 pension fund members at the Bass group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUNNING an office without paper is quite a target for an organisation which
by its very nature handles hundreds of documents every day. But, by early
1993, the pensions department at brewing and leisure group, Bass, will be
storing and handling all documents by computer.
The document image processing system, supplied by UK company Image Systems
Europe, is already in use. Meanwhile a team of five temporary staff is well
on the way to feeding in all remaining paper documents.
The pensions department in West Bromwich handles the files of 52,000 members
of the group pension scheme.
Previously all files were held as paper. Every event affecting an
individual's membership added more paper: joining the scheme, marriage,
retirement, death, all involve letters, forms and certificates.
Some of the older documents were recorded on microfilm, using an external
bureau, but even so staff desks were covered in mountains of files,
according to the secretary to the trustees, Mr Andrew Jolly.
'We were becoming inundated with paper files which were unmanageable,
insecure and too often hard to find,' he says. 'It could take days to find
something if it had been misfiled.'
Mr Jolly investigated document image processing with the group computing
department. Further ideas on how the system would work arose from talks with
potential suppliers.
The new system links 20 IBM personal computers, fitted with 19-inch,
high-resolution screens, over a Novell local network. There are two document
scanners, although one will probably be removed once all remaining documents
have been fed in.
Image Systems Europe was selected for its software for controlling the flow
of work. A document is scanned in and indexed, typically by name and
birthday or national insurance number. It then appears in the electronic
mailbox of the relevant staff member.
When a document has been worked on, it can be passed to another person for
further action, or a date can be entered on which the system will alert the
staff member that some action is expected.
Priorities can be set for each document, although staff can still choose
which jobs to deal with. The system provides an audit trail of file
movements, and managers can inspect individuals' electronic mailboxes to see
what they are doing at any time and question their priorities if necessary.
Mr Jolly will not reveal the costs of the system but points to considerable
tangible and intangible benefits. Storage space is being reduced: the 80
filing cabinets will all go by early 1993. Every letter, form and
certificate is now scanned into the system and then destroyed.
There is now total security: previously all information was on paper in one
place: a fire would have destroyed years of work. Today back-up copies of
the information are stored away from the office. In addition, access to
certain files can be restricted by system passwords.
Productivity is higher: the increasing workload can be handled by the same
number of staff. This productivity increase arises from several factors. Mr
Jolly points, in particular, to the better working conditions: there are no
more stacks of paper on people's desks. In addition, any document can be
retrieved from disc storage on to a screen in a few seconds - and any number
of staff at separate personal computers can look at a document at the same
time.
PRODUCTIVITY increases also come from the fact that the department used the
installation of the system to review the way the work was organised. Staff
now have access to word processing and spreadsheet software, to electronic
mail across the group and to the group mainframe computer in Chichester,
which holds the pension scheme members' database and calculates benefits.
This means, for example, that staff now write their own letters and do their
own calculations - 'staff have been given more responsibility and control
over their work,' Mr Jolly says. 'They have more variety and job
satisfaction.'
The link with the group mainframe means the system can extract benefits
information, names and addresses, and so on, and combine them with the
stored documents. This data can also be included in letters to pension
scheme members.
Electronic mail is used to send documents to operating companies for them to
act on.
As Mr Jolly says: 'Ultimately our administrators will be able to process
incoming documents, extract data from corporate files for benefit
calculations, notify an operating company, write to a scheme member or
pensioner and file the documents, all without touching any paper.'
Image Systems Europe, based in Sheffield and London, was formed in 1990 by a
management buy-out of British Steel's document image processing team. It has
grown to 30 staff and a projected turnover of Pounds 2m for 1992-93. The
30-plus customers include BP, Unilever, the Post Office, British Airways,
British Aerospace and several big local authorities. The company's software
for controlling work flow can run on personal computer and Unix networks.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (3): Goodbye to
paper shuffling? - Boost for office efficiency / John Kavanagh highlights
significant improvements in office productivity through the use of document
image processing, compared with traditional paper filing systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST five per cent of a company's information is held on computer and only
one per cent is available on-line. Much of the rest is stored in filing
cabinets, which are being poured into UK offices at a rate of 10,000 a day.
As a result, executives spend four weeks of their expensive time every year
simply looking for documents. It costs Pounds 75 on average to find a
document which has been misfiled.
These and other findings from the many studies of office productivity - or
the lack of it - are used by both suppliers and users to argue the case for
document image processing systems.
A document is defined in different ways here. In some cases, originals such
as application forms and letters are scanned in to the system and held as
true images, albeit as a collection of ones and zeros that a computer
understands.
In other cases a document is a collection of data from a company's own
computer: for example, statement data or text from a letter produced on a
word processor. Here, there is no need to hold a complete image of the
document, including the letterhead: if the document has to be sent out again
it can simply be printed on office stationery in the correct format.
Documents can also be annotated with short spoken messages, again stored in
digital form. Other additions can be typed in or handwritten and scanned.
All these original or computer documents, plus any additional notes, can be
grouped into an electronic file, just as documents, photocopies, memos and
so on might be stored together in a folder in a filing cabinet. However,
there are some big differences between a document image processing system
and a filing cabinet. These differences are bringing impressive increases in
office productivity and competitiveness.
Document systems use optical discs: the ones and zeros representing letters
and numbers are literally burnt into the surface by a laser. A single
12-inch disc can store 7m characters: this means around 50,000 A4 page
images or 300,000 or more pages of computer data.
A storage device - commonly referred to as a jukebox - can store over 200
discs: a jukebox with 100 discs and two drives can retrieve any document
from any disc and display it on a computer screen in around 20 seconds. In
addition, any number of people can look at and work on the same document on
t heir screens at the same time.
These differences in storage space and retrieval times alone have brought
big savings to organisations which are using document systems successfully.
A study by Nolan Norton, a computing consultancy subsidiary of KPMG
Management Consulting, shows floor space savings of 50-80 per cent,
transaction time cuts of 50-90 per cent and increases in transactions per
employee of 25-50 per cent, leading to staff cuts of 30-40 per cent.
Such savings make it surprising, perhaps, that even in the most advanced
markets, such as the UK, the number of systems can be counted in hundreds
rather than thousands. This is despite the fact that almost all leading
computer manufacturers are in the market.
Consultants and suppliers point to two reasons:
The pioneer suppliers of the early 1980s, notably Philips and then Filenet,
sold systems based on their own computers and other equipment. This was in
the days before so-called open systems emerged and users started questioning
the idea of tying themselves to a particular supplier and computer range.
The early systems were viewed largely as rather expensive straight
replacements for filing cabinets and microfilm, simply to be document
archives.
However, developments in 1990s have led to market growth forecasts of
anything from 26 to 60 per cent a year in Europe.
Software suppliers have emerged to build systems based on standard equipment
such as IBM-type personal computers and Novell networks, supplemented with
optical disc units, document scanners and larger, high-resolution screens.
These companies have put their emphasis on software to control the flow of
work between staff. Links are being provided into data held on the
traditional corporate central mainframe computer.
Suddenly document image processing systems are no longer peripheral filing
systems but at the centre of a company's business.
'Companies are literally cutting their customer-response times from days to
minutes through work-flow software,' says Mr Kamran Kheirolomoom, chairman
and chief executive of US supplier Viewstar, which recently launched its
product in the UK through computing services group EDS Scicon.
He points to Viewstar customer Texas Commerce Bancshares, which won an
innovation award in October for its loan application processing system.
Application forms and supporting documents are sent by fax to the head
office, where the transmissions are received directly by personal computers
and stored on optical discs.
The work-flow software then directs the forms to the relevant people for
checking credit status, other accounts and loans already held and so on. A
reply is sent back to the branch by fax, with the centre having stored and
handled all relevant documents without touching any paper.
'The time to process applications has been cut from two or three weeks to
three hours,' Mr Kheirolomoom says. 'The company is winning business on this
benefit.'
The Texas Commerce Bancshares experience is confirmed by the Nolan Norton
study, which shows that in manual filing systems 65 per cent of staff time
is spent on shuffling and filing pieces of paper and only 16 per cent on
dealing with the customer.
Kamran Kheirolomoom and many others see document image processing really
making its mark in so-called business re-engineering: the complete overhaul
of the way a company is organised and works. This applies especially to
organisations in which individuals or teams work on a document and then pass
it to another team for the next action.
A typical example is a company which deals with the public through
application forms and telephone or letter enquiries: certainly the banking
and insurance industries are currently the biggest users.
'In these cases, the work-flow and the work place are organised around the
physical movement of documents, such as an insurance claim form,' says Mr
Roger Sinden, an executive consultant specialising in document image
processing at KPMG Management Consulting. He adds: 'This organisation
structure, based on work flow, is outdated in an era of instant electronic
communication.'
The need for business re-engineering is underlined by Mr Chris Gill, a
European director of Japanese information technology company, Oki - 'studies
show that office workers' output has grown by only one per cent over the
last decade while the amount of time they spend in the office has risen by
20 per cent,' he says.
'Meanwhile spending on information processing systems has increased
five-fold in the last 20 years. Our research has highlighted work flow as a
major problem. Productivity is hit by delays in document movements and by
interruptions such as the arrival of a fax.'
Factors that hinder acceptance
There are still barriers to the acceptance of document image processing. One
is cost. Prolonged viewing of document images demands large screens with
high resolution. There is the cost of the scanner and of the optical disc
drives.
Work-flow software has to be added. EDS Scicon says a system with 10 to 15
users will start at around Pounds 50,000, including the special hardware and
software but excluding standard networked personal computers.
Another barrier is a lack of understanding of what the systems can do. Roger
Sinden at KPMG says that 'some people think they can throw all their books
in and the system will allow them to do full text searches on any keywords.'
Optical character reading is possible but expensive and, besides, the main
purpose of the systems is to store and control the flow of complete
documents for business.
Mr Sinden says optical character reading could be used in a small way to
read identification codes added to a document; other methods include barcode
reading or optical mark recognition.
At Texas Commerce Bancshares identification data is keyed in using the
telephone keypad attached to the fax machine.
The impact that the systems can have on a business is also a barrier, in
that it forces management to look at the whole way the company is run.
Certainly suppliers in Europe say they are having to do a lot of work to
sell their systems. Roger Sinden talks of sales efforts lasting up to two
years.
If the research is to be believed, during that two years the executives
considering the proposal will each have spent eight weeks looking for
documents.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (1): Importance of
software quality - Comment / Users have a right to some kind of independent
guarantee of quality and competence from software suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLIKE, say, a Faberge egg, software quality can be neither seen nor felt.
Where it is lacking, however, the consequences can range from simple
irritation to fatalities.
As an increasing proportion of the mechanisms which underpin our daily lives
 -from information systems to manufacturing robots - is passed over to the
computer, software quality issues are assuming a new and pressing
importance.
Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, made it clear the
government is taking the issue seriously when last month he helped launch a
new award scheme for quality software. He said: 'Software quality is crucial
for the success of business and public services. The consequences of lack of
quality are being reported almost daily.'
Software failures make news when they involve massive disruption; banks
which are prevented from settling their liabilities, for example, or control
systems which permit accidents in nuclear power plants. But the less obvious
effects of lack of software quality are making themselves felt every day.
Stratus, the US manufacturer of fault tolerant computer systems recently,
attempted to estimate the effect of unplanned system downtime in UK
industry.
It calculated that the largest 1,100 organisations are losing approximately
Pounds 700m a year in revenues and productivity through computer downtime.
While hardware problems were responsible for 51 per cent of downtime, faults
in applications software, operating software and networking software could
be held to account for almost as large a proportion.
The question of software liability and economic loss is a legal grey area,
but Mr John Hull, specialist in intellectual property with the law firm
Wilde Sapte, provides persuasive reasons to suppose that 'it would be
ill-advised to assume there can never be liability for economic loss arising
out of defective software.'
Is, for example, a software error equivalent to a negligent mis-statement,
for which there is legal precedent for the award of damages?
In engineering terms, certainly, software is very strange stuff indeed.
Beyond a certain level of complexity it becomes very difficult to prove not
only that it will do what it is intended to do but that it will not do
something unexpected and untoward.
There have been a number of powerful improvements in the way the software
industry develops its products. These include mathematically-based formal
methods, software test harnesses and and computer aided engineering systems.
But these are essentially tools to take some of the risk out of the
developers' efforts.
Users have a right to some kind of independent guarantee of quality and
competence from software suppliers. What kinds of stamp of approval exist
already?
The starting point is BS 5750, the British Standard for Quality Systems, a
generalised model for a quality system. It is also the basis for
international set of quality standards ISO 9000. BS 5750 is industry
independent; it has nothing specific to say about software development, but
it does indicate that a customer should be able to expect consistent
delivery of high quality products and services on time and within budget
from a holder of the standard.
Neither has it anything to say about commercial practice. It is no
substitute for a legally binding contract in cases where a software supplier
fails to fulfill business obligations.
MR HESELTINE'S comments on software quality were made at the introduction to
an extension to the existing TickIT certification scheme, which is jointly
sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry and the computer industry.
The scheme conforms to ISO 9001 and involves inspection by quality auditors
every three years. Introduced in 1991, it provides quality management
certification specifically tailored for the information technology industry.
The extension, the TickIT award for excellence, is sponsored by
International Business Machines. It is, however, a competitive scheme and
only four awards will be given each year - one each to small, medium and
large businesses and one to an in-house developer. The British Standards
organisation, however, is pressing beyond BS 5750 with a new scheme,
announced late last month, which will make possible 'kitemark' awards for
software packages - in the accounting area to begin with, but with the
intention of spreading the scheme to other sectors. Payroll is likely to be
next.
The British Standards Institute, which has itself no expertise in qualifying
software, is working with the consultancy KPMG which has been operating a
software quality centre in Boston, Massachusetts, for over a decade.
The test, which will cost company's between Pounds 15,000 for a pc product
and Pounds 50,000 for a mainframe system, will be in two parts. The BSI will
test for compliance with BS 5750, while KPMG will evalute the product to
ensure that it complies with a statrement of minimum functionality and that
it conforms to the description given by its suppliers.
'We are looking first to find software defects,' KPMG says. 'Then we seek to
determine the expected risk of software failure when tested is completed.
Finally, we categorise and summarise the defects uncovered during the
testing.'
KPMG points out it will be unable to guarantee there are no bugs in the
product, but once a package has been awarded the Kitemark, it will be
retested on an annual basis. One reason, according to KPMG, is that one in
three bug-fixes creates another bug. There are other, less formal,
indicators of quality. The Queen's Award for Technology or Export should
indicate a better than average product as should a Design Council Award.
There are a number of research studies, some of them funded by the European
Commission, into ways of ensuring that software is provably correct.
To date, there has been substantial progress although no real breakthroughs.
Perhaps there cannot be. But customers should demand that software products
meet at least a minimum level of functionality and should insist on an
authorised indication that that standard has been met.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (27): Topics in the
next issue - Software at work
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spring 1993 issue of Software At Work will look at:
Project management systems.
Electronic data interchange (EDI) in the retail business.
For both these topics, we are looking for users to interview about the
products they use.
The hot topic will be rapid application development systems.
Project management packages have been around for so long that some doughty
de facto 'standards' have emerged. The arrival of PC packages has made this
management and resourcing tool available to many more companies. Software At
Work's research will cover the entire range, from PC to mainframe offerings.
EDI, the paper slayer, has long promised to change the way people do
businesss. In retail businesses it offers not only increased efficiency but
improved market research. In manufacturing it makes Just In Time techniques
a reality. Linked into financial systems, it can cut the ordering and
payment cycle.
The hot topic: rapid applications development - software tools to write
other software - should have sent the programmer productivity rate soaring.
With demands for new applications increasing, these tools hold a promise of
meeting otherwise impossible deadlines.
The two 'user topics' follow the usual pattern of interviewing users of
various products: suppliers and users wishing to participate should contact
Software At Work (see address below) for the relevant forms, as soon as
possible, in writing please, and stating which section is of interest.
The Software at Work writing team would also like to invite companies to
tell us how they are using software in many other areas: see details on page
20 for topics covered in previous issues; plus a provisional schedule for
the coming year.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Drive to increase private cash in public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has invited businesses to suggest ways of increasing the use
of private finance in public services and to identify obstacles which stand
in the way of such co-operation.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday the
government was determined to remove unnecessary obstacles to private-sector
investment in Britain's infrastructure.
At the same time the Treasury published the guidance issued to departments
giving details of the private-finance initiative announced by the chancellor
in the Autumn Statement. This aims to involve the private sector in funding
infrastructure projects and in capital investment in public services.
The guidance covers four areas of greater co-operation:
Projects the private sector can finance wholly out of user charges, such as
toll roads or river crossings. These will no longer have to show that they
would be cheaper than publicly financed projects.
Joint ventures. The government might provide part of the funding for
projects the private sector cannot wholly finance by user charges - for
example toll roads which are profitable only with a government grant.
Leasing of assets. At present the capital value of most leased assets is
counted as public expenditure in the first year of the lease. In future the
costs can be spread over the period of the lease where the 'great majority
of the risk' lies with the private-sector lessor.
Buying in services which need large capital expenditure from the private
sector. Instead of buying costly equipment, such as body scanners, the
health service could pay for the use of such equipment owned by the private
sector.
The guidance says the crucial factor will be that 'the private sector must
genuinely accept the risk'. The Treasury says that once this criterion is
met it should be left to the private sector to make its own decisions.
Projects should be open to competition if the government needs to facilitate
them, though this will not be needed if the only action involves planning
permission. This might discourage promoters from putting forward proposals
which might then be taken up and won by competitors, so the government says
it will consider whether there should be payments for such preparatory work.
Sir David Hancock, a former top civil servant who is now a director of
Hambros Bank, said the guidance showed the government was now making real
efforts to involve private finance.

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKODA, the Czech motor group controlled by Volkswagen, and Dorries
Scharmann, the German engineering company, have set up a DM50m (Dollars
31.40m) joint venture to make heavy steel-cutting equipment at Skoda's base
in Pilzen, in the west of the Czech republic.
Skoda and Dorries Scharmann currently make similar equipment, and the
venture is effectively a takeover of Skoda's current production.
Under the agreement, which was signed yesterday, each company will initially
control 49 per cent, but, in return for providing the finance, Dorries
Scharmann will gain control of the remaining 2 per cent in 1997. That 2 per
cent is to be held in escrow.
Skoda said the joint venture would 'help stabilise its current position' in
the sector and give it access to world markets.
The company has been badly hit by falling demand for its products in
Czechoslovakia as the impact of economic reforms begins to bite.
Skoda is in stalemate with Siemens, the German industrial group on setting
up transport and energy joint ventures.

FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Software group steps up action against
theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 37 companies in 10 European countries face legal action as the
Business Software Alliance steps up its campaign against software theft.
The companies include AMS Industries, a subsidiary of Siemens of Germany
based in the UK, Renfe, the Spanish state-owned railroad group, Docks de
France, Maison de la Geographie and Dargaud Editeur in France, and the Falck
Steel Company in Italy.
The BSA is an organisation representing the world's leading personal
computer software companies, including Microsoft, Lotus and Aldus. It has
brought a total of 150 actions against companies in Europe suspected of
copying software illegally.
The BSA typically collects evidence of piracy before seeking court orders to
enter the premises of suspect companies to seize counterfeit software.
Mr Bradford Smith, the BSA's European counsel, said the latest action was an
indication of the pace of activity that could be expected after January 1,
when an EC directive outlawing software piracy comes into force.
Worldwide, piracy is reckoned to be costing software producers between
Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.1bn) in lost revenue, with EC and
Efta countries accounting for 46 per cent of the total.
The UK leads Europe in legal software with about 70 per cent of software
legally obtained, according to the BSA, while only about 20 per cent of the
software used in Italy and Spain is legal.
Mr Smith said BSA's concern over the wording of the UK's intended
legislation to implement the EC directive on piracy had largely been
resolved.
There had been fears that ambiguity in the wording might lead to confusion
when cases came to court. He said, however, there were still a few areas
where the Commission might take issue with the proposed UK law.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOMB exploded yesterday evening in a car parked near Woodside Park
Underground station in north London. Scotland Yard said that vehicles were
damaged but nobody had been hurt. The station is above ground near the end
of the Northern Line.
The bomb exploded less than an hour after a coded telephone warning had been
given to the AP news agency by a man who said he was from the IRA. The
agency said the caller named Woodside Park, saying that a large device was
in position. The caller said there were '15 minutes to clear the station'.
Police evacuated the station and a nearby school and the Tube line near
Woodside Park was closed through the night for searches.
The scene of the blast is about a mile from Inglis Barracks where one
soldier was killed and nine injured in a bombing in August 1988.
Yesterday's blast follows the introduction of random police road checks in
central London and in Manchester, where 64 people were hurt in two blasts
last week. The IRA has threatened a Christmas bombing campaign on the
mainland.

The Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which governs the bulk of the world's textiles

Frances Williams writes from Geneva. The extension, the fifth since 1974,
was made necessary by the delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of global
trade talks, which includes a draft accord to phase out the MFA over 10
years.
Deciding the extension yesterday the textiles committee of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said bilateral agreements negotiated next
year within the MFA framework should provide more access than their
predecessors to rich-country markets, with special consideration being given
to small suppliers and least developed countries.

<TEXT>
Japan is considering whether to provide a financial contribution to
UN-backed relief efforts in Somalia, Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet
secretary, said yesterday, Steven Butler reports from Tokyo.
Mr Kato's comments were the strongest indication yet that Japan would back
the international effort led by the US, although Japan may still be
vulnerable to criticism that its response was late and inadequate. In
particular, it is widely believed that Japan's slow reaction has damaged its
chances of becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Mr Kato said it was still too early to discuss the potential size of a
Japanese contribution. Mr Kato said, however, that Japan faced no
constitutional barriers to supporting the effort, since it was humanitarian
in nature.
He said Japan may provide medical assistance and refugee relief, and would
consider whether to support the effort with Japanese personnel. However,
there would be little public support for sending troops from its
Self-Defence Force to Somalia.
A unit of Japanese troops is now in Cambodia as part of the UN peace-keeping
effort. This is the first time since the second world war that Japanese
troops have been dispatched overseas, and there has been controversy both at
home and throughout Asia.
After a wrenching domestic debate, Japan eventually contributed Dollars 13bn
to supporting UN efforts in the Gulf War.

MR Manuel Bartlett, former Mexican interior minister, has vehemently denied
claims by US federal prosecutors that he was involved in drug-running and in
the 1985 murder of Mr Enrique Camarena, an official of the US Drug
Enforcement Agency, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The accusations were made during the trial of Mr Alvarez Humberto Machain, a
Mexican doctor kidnapped by DEA agents to face charges in the US of aiding
the torture and murder of Mr Camarena.
The fall-out from the allegations may hit relations between the countries at
a time when Mexico is keen to be on good terms with the incoming Clinton
administration.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Top Clinton officials face tough ethics code:
President-elect may pick woman as attorney-general
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR officials in the incoming Clinton administration will be obliged to
sign an ethical code preventing them from ever lobbying a future US
government on behalf of foreign governments.
Members of the Cabinet and top deputies will be barred from lobbying their
former departments on behalf of domestic or foreign private-sector clients
for five years after leaving office. Senior White House officials will also
be subject to a five-year proscription from approaching departments for
which they had substantial responsibility.
Mr Warren Christopher, director of President-elect Bill Clinton's transition
team, said yesterday these were 'the strongest standards any president has
asked of his employees'. Current practice places a one-year lobbying ban on
former government employees, regardless of whether it is for domestic or
overseas interests.
The new code will apply to about 1,100 of the approximately 3,000 political
appointments Mr Clinton will be making in the months ahead. The first of
these may come today, as the economic policy team, headed by Senator Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas as treasury secretary, is due to be unveiled.
The New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Clinton was likely to choose a
woman as his attorney-general. This may reflect criticism that the likely
economic line-up is comprised exclusively of white males.
The four short-listed candidates for the Justice Department are Ms Patricia
Wald, a federal appeals court judge in Washington, Ms Amalya Kearse, who
holds a similar position in New York and who is seen as a potential Supreme
Court Justice when the next vacancy occurs, Ms Judith Kaye, a New York state
appeals court judge, and Ms Brooksley Born, a partner in Arnold and Porter,
a prominent Washington law firm.
In the course of the presidential campaign Mr Clinton said he was disturbed
by 'the revolving door between public service and private enrichment'. Mr
Ross Perot, the independent candidate, was even more damning. He claimed
foreign lobbyists, often former government officials, controlled the
Washington agenda.
However, in drawing up a code for his transition team Mr Clinton was obliged
to exempt from it such senior advisers as Mr Warren Christopher and Mr
Vernon Jordan, lawyers with extensive foreign and domestic public and
private-sector clients. Both had to agree, however, to suspend such
activities during the transition.
The permanent standards, to be embodied in an executive order signed by Mr
Clinton soon after he assumes office next month, will not exclude current or
former lobbyists from receiving posts in the administration. Medical and
scientific appointees, many of whom rely on government grants in their
professions, will be exempt from it, as will be career civil servants and
other former government officials hired for a different agency.
These exemptions are necessary so as not to deter well-qualified personnel
from joining the important middle ranks of the new administration.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Bush nominee advises against Iraq prosecutor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE retired former New Jersey judge hand-picked by the Bush administration
to examine whether a special prosecutor should be named to investigate
possible criminal wrongdoing by administration officials in US dealings with
Iraq yesterday said there was no need for such an appointment.
Mr Frederick Lacey, a 72-year-old judge appointed to the bench under
President Nixon, concluded there had been no wrongdoing in officials'
handling of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans scandal.
The judge's conclusions ignited criticism by leading congressional
Democrats, who called on President-elect Bill Clinton to investigate the
'Iraqgate' affair once in office.
Judge Marvin Shoob, who presided over the BNL Atlanta case, yesterday said
he was surprised and disappointed by Mr Lacey's recommendation because there
was 'ample evidence not only of a cover-up, but of government participation
that was improper'.
In remarks that at times sounded like an apologia for the Bush
administration, Mr Lacey claimed that 'many decent people have had their
careers tarnished and their reputations stained by being charged with being
part of a cover-up. These are baseless charges.'
Mr Lacey, echoing the view of Mr William Barr, the US attorney-general who
must decide on a special prosecutor, termed congressional charges of a
cover-up 'arrant nonsense'.
Judge Lacey's defence of the administration was curious as he informed Mr
Barr on October 26 that there were 'sufficiently specific and credible
allegations' to extend his inquiry. Instead, Mr Lacey yesterday blamed
congressional Democrats and the media for being irresponsible.
Mr Lacey, derided by some congressional critics as a 'patsy' for the Bush
administration, also gave his verdict on admissions by Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) officials that they deliberately concealed from prosecutors in
Atlanta reports about the involvement of BNL's head office in Rome. He
claimed these were 'a series of mistakes by well-meaning and
well-intentioned persons'.
Mr Lacey served until 1985 as a member of the US Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court, a secretive body that makes decisions about authorising
wiretaps and other intelligence matters.
Mr Jack Brooks, the conservative Texas Democrat who chairs the House
Judiciary Committee which originally demanded a special prosecutor,
yesterday called upon the new Clinton Administration 'to see that justice is
done' in the investigation of US dealings with Iraq.
During the presidential campaign Mr Clinton supported calls for a special
prosecutor and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, said the Iraqgate affair
was 'bigger than Watergate' and required investigation.

Northern Engineering Industries, the Rolls-Royce sub-sidiary, is proposing
to cancel and repay its outstanding 3 per cent, 5.375 per cent and 11 per

For the 3 per cent it is offering 105p, against a mid-market price on
December 4 of 40p, giving a gross exit yield of 3.8 per cent. The 100p offer
for the 5.375 per cent, against a market price of 70p, gives a yield of 7.2
per cent.
Holders of the 11 per cent are being offered 125p, against a market price of
118p, for a yield of 11.6 per cent.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Costly newspaper bill for Murray Intl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A disastrous venture into newspaper publishing by Murray International
Holdings, the holding company controlled by Mr David Murray, a leading
Scottish businessman and chairman of Rangers football club, cost the company
Pounds 5.7m.
Murray International, whose main business is steel stockholding but which
also has interests in property, leisure and electronics, closed the Sunday
Scot tabloid in July 1991 after only five months.
The group, 88 per cent owned by Mr Murray, lost Pounds 1.54m in the year
ended January 31 1992 on sales of Pounds 165m (Pounds 135.5m). A loss of
Pounds 1.6m from the Sunday Scot as shown as an extraordinary item.
The results for 1991 showed a loss of Pounds 4.2m for the newspaper as an
exceptional item, although it occurred in the next financial year. In 1991
the group lost Pounds 5.4m.
Murray is transferring its property interests to Premier Property, a new
company with the same shareholders as Murray International.

GREECE angrily warned its EC partners yesterday that it would reject any
effort at the summit to recognise the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia,
Reuter reports from Athens.
'We will veto EC recognition,' said a government spokesman. 'Our position is
clear. The republic must drop the term Macedonia from its name. All our
partners accepted this stand at the June summit.'
The dispute between Athens and Skopje, the Macedonian capital, has raised
tensions along the Greek border. The spokesman said Greece warned that any
deviation from the EC declaration that the term Macedonia must be dropped
would mean a crippling split in EC policy on Yugoslavia.

US Marines search a Somali citizen yesterday as part of their operation to
gain control of Mogadishu, the devastated capital. More than 1,300 Marines,
wearing desert camouflage and black face paint, swept through the city,
securing the airport and port as well as regaining control of the abandoned
US embassy compound.
The operation was completed without any major confrontations, although one
UN aid worker was shot and wounded on the airport road by unidentified
gunmen. The US relief effort, the largest ever undertaken in Africa, aims to
restore order to starvation-struck Somalia, which has fallen into a state of
anarchy. Many Somalis were stunned by the size and intensity of the US

FT  10 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness under a cloud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of meetings with City analysts arranged by Guinness after the
market closed yesterday added to worries over the outlook for the
international drinks group. The meetings followed remarks reportedly by the
Guinness chief executive and chairman-elect that conditions in 1993 'will be
more difficult than 1992.' Guinness shares tumbled on the news, dragging
other international drinks stocks in their wake.
In the earlier interview, Mr Tony Greener was quoted as saying that because
of expected difficulties 'we are not waiting for recovery.' This was
interpreted by some analysts as suggesting that Guinness' earnings growth
next year, already forecast to be sluggish, would be flatter than predicted
and could be near or down to zero. This compares with forecasts for the
industry of around 11 per cent.
Guinness said last night that the meetings had been held at the request of
analysts to clarify Mr Greener's reported remarks and that others had been
arranged for today. Mr Graeme Eadie at County NatWest said: 'It looks likely
that the market will have to pull back some forecasts tomorrow, possibly by
around 6 per cent.' The shares fell 23 to 502p.
BP active
The fall-out from Monday afternoon's presentation to oil analysts continued
to influence the ebb and flow in BP shares which were the heaviest traded on
the London market yesterday. Turnover topped 22m shares, the heaviest daily
total since mid-September.
Turnover was said to have been triggered chiefly by one substantial buying
order, reportedly from the US. American funds have been aggressive buyers of
BP stock and now speak for over 21 per cent of the shares, partly because of
the steep devaluation of sterling against the dollar in recent months, but
also because of the strong recovery story put forward by BP and many of the
US broking houses.
BP is scheduled to make a progress report to US institutions and analysts
later today and many UK observers are waiting to see the response of the
Americans to what should be a similar presentation. London analysts,
however, are concerned that any further marked downside in oil prices -
Brent crude fell sharply yesterday and closed below the Dollars 18 a barrel
mark - may well provide the catalyst for an abrupt about-turn in sentiment
in the US.
Lonrho advance
Ahead of an expected announcement, shares in international conglomerate
Lonrho jumped 5 to 79p, in brisk trade of 4.4m. The announcement, made after
the market closed, confirmed speculation that chief executive Mr Tiny
Rowland would sell half his 15 per cent stake in Lonrho at 115p.
Standard Chartered celebrated their elevation to Footsie-100 status with a
rise of 12 to 535p and were additionally helped by the better tone of Hong
Kong markets. HSBC put on 7 to 486p.
The recent profits downgrades, related to worries about increasing property
losses, continued to depress Barclays Bank shares which slipped 7 more to
377p on heavy turnover of 6.6m.
SG Warburg, still on the reserve list for the Footsie-100, retreated 15 to
505p, despite news that the group has emerged successfully from the beauty
parade for lead brokership to BT III.
Royal Insurance, also moved back into the top-100 list, suffered a bout of
indigestion after their recent outstanding performance, closing a penny off
at 264p. The shares were also unsettled by a general downgrading of the
whole of the composite insurance sector by Warburg Securities. Commercial
Union was the worst of the bunch, closing 13 off at 583p.
A strong overnight Wall Street supported both Wellcome and Smithkline,
shares in the former adding 5 to 1038p and the latter up 9 at 462p.
Lasmo ran back sharply, dipping to 148p, before settling 3 off at 151p,
after Strauss Turnbull, the broker, told clients to sell the stock down to
125p.
In the smaller stock Clyde lost 2 to 32p after some determined selling
pressure, but Premier Consolidated held up well to close unaltered at 17 1/2
p with one of the leading London intergrated houses said to have been
mopping up any stock on offer.
Theme park operator Euro Disney's rebound gathered pace, the shares, which
have fallen 40 per cent in three weeks, gaining 30 to 720p. Stories in the
French press that new management contracts may mean more funds for
shareholders and less for the Disney group lifted sentiment.
The recent surge in Stakis continued with renewed talk that a buyer had been
found for the group's nursing homes and that the board would be strengthened
at next month's results meeting. The shares rose a penny to 40p.
Next was a bright spot in a weak retail sector, the shares adding a penny to
137p. Nomura upgraded the group, forecasting profits this year of Pounds
31m, a rise of Pounds 5m. Profit-takers sent shares in Great Universal
Stores down 35 to 1653p.
The property sector was hit by a few determined sellers and a lack of the
small private buying which has sustained some of the stocks in recent weeks.
Among the fallers yesterday, MEPC, hurt additionally by a sell note from UBS
Phillips and Drew, slipped 6 to 330p.
Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms manufacturer hit by revelations of
accounting problems in recent weeks, staged a strong recovery, the shares
bouncing 9 to 114p in heavy turnover of 3.3m shares, with BZW a heavy buyer.
Mr Howard Seymour, BZW's building analyst, said he had recommended the
shares to clients as a buy up to 125p following a presentation at the London
broker. 'There are no further irregularities and we feel the shares should
be on a market rating, rather than at a discount,' said Mr Seymour.
Building materials group Hepworth settled 4 higher at 263p after broker
James Capel placed 9.75m shares at 249p to fund Hepworth's acquisition of
two Dutch companies.
More aggressive buying by Kleinwort Benson Securities drove Volex Group
shares up 33 to a record 395p. The broker is said to have been very
impressed by the Volex management at a lunch held at Kleinwort last week.
Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 10m a substantial part of which was recorded
early in the day after a 'bed and breakfast' tax related deal. The shares
eased a penny to 100p, with sentiment weakened by the belief that the stock
would no longer be a constituent of the FT-SE 100 stocks.
Among transport stocks, NFC closed 18 down at 266p, having touched 261p,
after a cautious full year results statement which included a Pounds 10.5m
pension contribution that surprised the market.
Two exceptionally heavy trades in Taylor Woodrow, 9m at 52p and 3.4m at the
same price, were interpreted as bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deals. A
trade of 4.4m Tarmac at 89p was seen as a tax deal.
The FT-SE 100 Committee yesterday approved inclusion in the Index from
December 21 of Royal Insurance and Standard Chartered and exclusion of BET
and Rolls-Royce.
Newly-included in the FT-SE Mid 250 and FT-SE Actuaries 350 will be Taunton

FT  10 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers return to hurt equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER bout of fairly modest profit-taking in the UK stock market yesterday
cut into some of the share price gains achieved over the past month. Selling
pressure remained fairly light and the pattern was somewhat uneven, with the
big names in the FT-SE list hurt by weakness in stock index futures, where
the premium on the December contract was savaged. A sharp setback in
sterling discouraged dwindling hopes of a further cut in UK base rates this
year. London took its cue from doubts elsewhere in Europe of any interest
move from the Bundesbank today.
Equities opened firmer, with the stock market again responding to favourable
reports from US purchasing managers on the outlook for the US economy.
Attention was focused on the prospects for the meeting in Edinburgh tomorrow
of EC leaders. Maastricht tensions were soon reflected in uncertainty over
the implications surrounding the downward trend in sterling. However, some
strategists suggested that the pound might soon stabilise and that this
trend would encourage overseas investment in UK securities, especially UK
government bonds.
But once again, other considerations appeared to be sidelined when the stock
index futures market opened and with the December contract on the Footsie
under some pressure, share prices quickly turned off.
The Footsie slid by more than 20 points before steadying as it challenged
the 2,750 area. Trading volume was slow at first but picked up when share
prices staged a minor rally before the close. Wall Street, 8.75 up on the
Dow Average in London hours, provided little interest for the UK market.
At its final reading, the FT-SE Index was 19.1 off at 2,750.7. Strategists
continued to take the view that a pause for profit-taking down to these
Footsie levels is quite acceptable and does not change overall views of the
market outlook. While some of the more hopeful forecasts for the year-end
may now be in doubt, equity traders remain optimistic for the new year.
Seaq-reported volume of 660.5m shares compared with 605m on Tuesday, when
retail, or customer business, recovered to record worth of Pounds 1.16bn.
Profit-taking appeared to be fairly widespread across the range of the
market, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was down by 9.5 points yesterday.
For the near term, investment views on the outlook for interest rates
remained uncertain. 'We continue to have doubts about a base rate cut before
the end of January or early February,' commented Mr Trevor Laugharne at
Kleinwort Benson Securities, adding, however, that the prospect of another
cut helps maintain interest in UK equities.
The final picture was somewhat mixed, with most of the blue chip
internationals easier, while ICI, a dull feature in recent sessions, finding
some support. Retail and store issues, closely linked to day-to-day views on
base rate hopes, met some light selling. yesterday.
The market was also featured by sharp movements in a handful of stocks
driven by special situations. Guinness gave ground with UK investors
believed to be taking a fresh look at the shares, while Lonrho continued to
move higher ahead of a widely-expected statement from the boardroom.

FT  10 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES had a dull session in which the weakness in sterling led to a
sharp decline in stock index futures and turnover in traded options fell to
its lowest level in recent weeks, writes Joel kibazo.
After a steady opening at 2,784, the December contract on the FT-SE moved
ahead to 2,789, within the first few minutes of trading. However, this
turned out to be the day's high, the contract then going into decline,
pulling the underlying cash market lower, as dealers focused instead on the
weakness of sterling. The low of the day was recorded over lunch when
December fell to 2,756.
After a period of sideways trading, the contract staged a brief rally
brought about by a firm opening on Wall Street and speculation ahead of
today's Bundesbank meeting.
December finished at 2,763, down 12 on Tuesday's session and around 7 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 4. Turnover at 6,862
was substantially down on Tuesday's figure.
Rolling forward into the March contract continued and business in March
totalled 1,834 lots.
Total volume in traded options was a mere 16,641 contracts with the FT-SE
100 option recording only 2,615 lots against Tuesday's 9,394 contracts.
Glaxo was the busiest stock option and traded 1,864 lots, with the March 800
puts the busiest series, followed by British Steel at 1,806.

dividend fears

Wall Street
US share prices were flat-to-lower in heavy trading yesterday as the market
consolidated some of its recent gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.63 at 3,323.81 below
its peak for the day when the index had been 13 points higher. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended its record-breaking streak with a
decline of 1.33 to 435.66 while the Amex composite gave up 1.67 at 392.98
and the Nasdaq composite slipped 3.20 to 663.92, off its all-time high.
Turnover on the NYSE was 231m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 1102 to
728.
Blue chips opened higher amid optimism about the economy and corporate
earnings but were unable to hold on to their gains in active two-way
trading.
The release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book' report on nationwide
business conditions - had little impact on the market primarily because it
said little new about the economy, and was consistent with recent indicators
that have pointed to a moderate expansion in economic growth. The Fed's
surveys found a 'modest improvement' in economic activity, low inflation,
but continued weakness in manufacturing employment.
Equity investors were cheered by the reaction of the bond market, which
barely budged after the Fed's report was published. The bond market was
pleased that the Fed discovered no signs of resurgent inflationary pressures
in the economy. Investors will get a better indication of inflation today
and tomorrow when the November consumer and producer prices indices are due
to be released.
IBM fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 62 5/8 as the stock continued to suffer
from the predictions of two Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that the
computer giant will announce further restructuring moves that could hurt its
earnings. The warnings raised fears that the company's dividend might be
threatened.
Lockheed jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 55 3/4 in busy trading after the
company concluded an agreement to buy General Dynamics' tactical military
aircraft business for Dollars 1.5bn in cash. General Dynamics, which is
expected to reap a net gain of about Dollars 650m from the deal, rose
Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 103 7/8 .
Bradlees fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 17 3/8 , Kmart dropped Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 25 5/8 , May Department Stores eased Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 68 7/8
and JC Penney fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 76 1/2 after the retailers, plus
many others, were downgraded by Merrill Lynch, the broking house, in
anticipation of a broad-based correction in retail stocks early next year.
Times Mirror dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 30 after the securities house
First Boston cut its investment rating on the stock from 'hold' to 'sell'
because of concerns about soft advertising revenues at the group's
newspapers.
Dime Savings Bank rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 5 3/8 after the bank said the
Office of Thrift Supervision had lowered Dime's risk-based capital ratio
from 9 per cent to 8 per cent, which should free up some additional capital.
Canada
TORONTO stocks finished lower after a heavy trading session marked by the
strong performance of companies with properties near the Northwest
Territories diamond find.
Investors flocked to junior mining stocks which hold property in the
Northwest Territories after Dia Met Minerals and partner Broken Hill
Property Ltd announced promising drilling results yesterday .
The TSE 300 edged down 5.4 to 3,285.5 on volume of 45.9 million shares
valued at CDollars 337m.

FT  10 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of early rate cut
help to lift Nikkei
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of cut in the discount rate and buying by public funds and investment
trusts helped the Nikkei average to post a moderate gain, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed up 124.37 to 17,406.22. The index fell to the
day's low of 17,325.88 just after the opening, but rose to a high of
17,498.40 as a higher futures market prompted arbitrage-buying by dealers.
Some earlier gains were eroded by afternoon profit-taking.
Volume rose to 240m shares from 189m as public funds, investment trusts, and
corporations bought shares for their employee stock ownership schemes.
Advances led declines by 676 to 250 with 189 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks rose 8.06 to 1,312.92 and in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.26 to 1,062.42.
Some investors were encouraged by mounting expectations of a cut in the
official discount rate as Sakura Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and
Sumitomo Bank followed Sanwa by cutting their short-term prime rates, the
base lending rates to corporate clients.
Leading investment advisory firms and life assurers were seen buying blue
chip issues. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y2 to Y298
and Kobe Steel, the second active, advanced Y3 to Y303.
Reports that Fujitsu has developed the world's first 256 megabit dynamic
random access memory chip boosted the shares by Y23 to Y556. Other
high-technology issues were also higher on hopes of a US economic recovery.
Toshiba rose Y5 to Y623 and NEC gained Y11 to Y680.
Banks were higher on hopes of larger profit margins due to lower interest
rates. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y10 to Y2,470 and Sakura Bank gained
Y20 to Y1,140.
Housing and real estate companies were firm on reports of brisk condominium
sales. Daikyo gained Y52 to Y822 and Mitsui Fudosan rose Y31 to Y993.
Some speculative theme stocks fell on profit-taking by dealers. Mitsui
Mining and Smelting fell Y4 to Y485 and Meiji Milk Products lost Y1 to Y928.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 168.51 to 18,854.51 in volume of 33.7m
shares, as dealers supported issues with positive earnings prospects.
Roundup
HONG KONG advanced strongly for the second consecutive day while other
markets in the region were mixed. Bombay remained closed as violence
continued to spread through the country.
HONG KONG responded positively to news that Tuesday's Sino-British talks had
gone smoothly, while unsubstantiated rumours that Governor Chris Patten
might soften his democratic reform proposals gave an additional boost to the
market late in the day. The Hang Seng index closed up 136.98 or 2.6 per cent
at 5,339.25 n turnover of HKDollars 2.25bn. HSBC Holdings rose HKDollars 2
to HKDollars 56.
SINGAPORE rebounded with a 12.71 gain in the Straits Times industrial index
to 1,446.74. Cerebos Pacific which recently reported good 1992 results rose
6 cents to SDollars 3.88 but off the day's high of SDollars 3.98.
SEOUL fell back with the composite index closing down 4.87 at 620.47.
Medicine and construction companies went against the trend on forecasts of
higher earnings this year. Hyundai Pharmaceutical rose Won600 to Won14,000
and Chong Kun Dang gained Won500 to Won25,500.
MANILA fell back on fears that legislation limiting the payment of the
country's foreign debt might be approved by Congress. The composite index
slid 12.76 to 1,265.96 in combined turnover of 160m pesos. Among major
issues, Philippine National Bank lost 9 pesos to 211 pesos and Manila
Electric A shares eased 4 pesos to 157 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR declined on profit-taking with the composite index losing 2.41
to 633.52 in turnover of some MDollars 212m, while TAIWAN advanced on
institutional buying, the weighted index improving 15.54 to 3,776.55 in
turnover of TDollars 13.6bn. In the electronics sector Acer was 30 cents
stronger at TDollars 18.90.
AUSTRALIA continued to rally with strong gains in BHP helping to lift the
market. The All Ordinaries index gained 13.3 to 1,482.1 in turnover of
ADollars 315m. BHP rose 28 cents to ADollars 12.34. Among banks, ANZ was
steady at ADollars 2.77, Westpac was 1 cent higher at ADollars 3.05, and the
Commonwealth dropped 5 cents to ADollars 6.03.
NEW ZEALAND fell back on profit-taking as the NZSE-40 index lost 9.73 to
1,517.14 in turnover of NZDollars 25m. Fletcher Challenge eased 5 cents to
NZDollars 2.34, Telecom lost 1 cent to NZDollars 2.39, Carter Holt Harvey
eased 2 cents to NZDollars 2.82 and Lion Nathan was down 5 cents at
NZDollars 3.86.
BANGKOK lost early gains to close little changed on the day. The SET index
rose 0.64 to 848.54 in turnover of Bt1.69bn, the lowest level since July.
Among actives, Bangkok Bank gained Bt0.50 to Bt91, Siam Cement lost Bt4 to
Bt522 and Bangkok Land shed Bt0.50 to Bt92.

FT  10 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg nurtures new optimism -
The fall in the financial rand has burnt foreign investors in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is finishing the year as it started -
on an optimistic note. But the optimism is based on fragile fundamentals and
the market is still vulnerable to a downward correction.
The overall index closed yesterday at 3,303, 12.9 per cent up on the year's
low of 2,924 reached on October 16, 11.8 per cent below the high of 3,749
reached on June 5 and about 4 per cent below where the index closed last
year.
The recovery has been on the back of an 11 per cent rise in the industrial
index from the October low, and a 15 per cent rise in the mining-financial
index in the same period.
Analysts, while not discounting another fast start in January - the overall
index rose by 8 per cent in the first two weeks of 1992 - are cautious about
the outlook for 1993, with few predicting a real return from equities.
If 1992 has been a poor year for local investors, then it has been a
disaster for foreigners. According to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, South
Africa has been the worst performer this year in dollar terms, falling by
37.5 per cent.
This is wholly attributable to the financial rand, the currency used by
foreign investors. The currency ended 1991 at R3.17 to the dollar - a
discount of 13.5 per cent to the commercial rand. Concerns about the
political situation and a perceived flood of offshore investments by South
African companies saw the currency weaken dramatically during the third
quarter. Yesterday it closed at R4.76 to the dollar, a discount of 37 per
cent to the commercial rand.
The features of the JSE during 1992 were twofold: first, the very weak
performance of mining and commodity stocks. This trend, reflecting weak
growth in the main world economies, was most vividly exemplified, and
exaggerated, by the precipitous fall in the price of the market's bellwether
stock, De Beers, after the announcement in August of disappointing results
and a likely dividend cut. Secondly, the equity market was overshadowed by a
very strong bond market, driven by a build-up in liquidity on account of the
weak economy, increased cash flows from individuals and institutions, and
exchange control.
The performance of the market during 1992 can be broken into four phases: a
quick start in January, with the gains reversed by April; phase 2, until
early June, saw the market rise to its peak; phase 3, until mid-October, saw
the market lose 22 per cent from its highs; while phase 4 has been the
upturn since October.
The market's downward correction, which commenced in June, was an overdue
reaction to domestic and international economic gloom, weak international
equity markets and the political fragility in South Africa.
The puzzle has been its subsequent upturn. In mid-October, there was still a
broad consensus that the market was more likely to end the year lower rather
than higher. What has changed?
Mr Peter Trengove Jones, equity strategist at the stockbrokers Simpson
McKie, cites three factors: an improved political mood, with greater
evidence of pragmatism from the main players; better than expected economic
figures from the US, and Wall Street doing well; and the familiar hothouse
effect on the JSE which accentuates change in sentiment.
He argues that the market has still got a downside risk in the short term, a
view endorsed by Mr Tony Gibson of the Cape-based Syfrets group. He
anticipates a downward correction in the first quarter, the likely catalyst
being US stocks moving lower on perceptions of an impending interest rate
rise. Mr Gibson says he doubts whether equities will outperform the 2-4 per
cent real return which a medium-dated gilt will provide in 1993.
Mr Roy McAlpine of Liberty Asset Management says short-term movements of the
market have become totally unpredictable. He remains cautious in outlook on
account of the uncertain fundamentals. 'To make money out of equities in
1993 you're going to have to be extremely selective,' he says.
Foreign investors, after their recent experience, are likely to remain wary.
Mr Trengove Jones says investors are only willing to take a punt on the
market. He says the mood is very 'hands-off' as far as medium-long term
investment is concerned, since the volatility of the financial rand is a
'major turn-off'. Investors are taking the view that even if they read the
market correctly, they remain at the mercy of the currency.

FT  10 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris beg to
differ on Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANKFURT and Paris harboured conflicting views about the Bundesbank's
actions today, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was further buffeted by gloomy economic forecasts and a belief
that the Bundesbank will not ease interest rates at today's council meeting.
The DAX index fell to an intraday low of 1,492 but ended 7.65 lower at
1,500.59. Turnover was not available yesterday.
A report from the Ifo research institute forecasting little prospect for
economic recovery before 1994 came on top of a study by west German
retailers which saw a 1 per cent decline in sales in 1992, the first decline
in 10 years.
Deutsche Bank fell another DM5.10 to DM648 following Tuesday's disappointing
10-month results, while Daimler was DM5.30 easier at DM517.70 as selling
continued following Airbus's recent order loss.
Lufthansa went against the trend with a 50 pfg rise to DM96 after announcing
that it had taken a 13 per cent stake in Luxembourg's national airline.
Volkswagen improved DM2.50 to DM254 after its recent weakness.
PARIS had a quiet morning but was lifted in the afternoon by a strong Matif
which rose on hopes of a cut in German interest rates today, though equity
dealers were not so convinced. The CAC-40 index ended 25.28 or 1.4 per cent
higher at 1,791.16 in good turnover of FFr2.5bn.
The rise in the index was helped by a big rebound in Elf which bounced back
by FFr18 or 5.4 per cent to FFr350 after Tuesday's 4.1 per cent fall
following its chairman's profit warning.
The most active stock yesterday was Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez which fell
another FFr22 or 4.5 per cent to FFr460 on worries about the financial
outlook for its Dumez building subsidiary.
The drinks group Pernod Ricard dropped FFr11.70 or 3.2 per cent to FFr354.30
on news that a board meeting planned for yesterday had been postponed until
January, raising fears about the company's 1992 results.
MILAN had a mixed day after Tuesday's closure as Stet rose on privatisation
hopes and Fiat dived on worse-than-expected November car sales. The Comit
index rose 1.11 to 432.03 in turnover estimated at more than Monday's
L121bn.
Fiat was settled L25 higher at L4,125 but then fell as low as L3,950 in
afternoon trading in London on reports that its car sales had fallen 11.74
per cent in November from the same month a year earlier.
Stet was fixed L14 up at L1,578 but reached L1,655 in the afternoon on news
that the government was prepared to sell its controlling stake in the
telecommunications company.
ZURICH saw activity in chemicals and pharmaceuticals as the SMI index rose
18.2 to 1,980.7. Ciba-Geigy was one of the day's most active stocks as its
registered shares rose SFr5 to SFr601.
Georg Fischer bearers put on SFr5 to SFr685 in spite of the company's
forecast that 1992 group results would be below expectations.
AMSTERDAM was higher and ING featured among favoured stocks. The CBS
Tendency index was 0.4 higher at 106.2 as ING rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 52.30. The
insurer has been performing strongly since releasing good nine-month figures
last week. ABN Amro was 70 cents up at Fl 49.90.
STOCKHOLM extended its rally into a third day, thanks to heavy demand for
shares in Astra. Its B shares finished up SKr17 at SKr727 on speculation of
a share split and hopes of positive news at a forthcoming analysts meeting.
The Affarsvarlden general index advanced 12.0 to 898.4 as turnover rose to
SKr866m from SKr579m, of which Astra accounted for SKr140m.
ISTANBUL fell back 1 per cent on rumours that a withholding tax might be
introduced soon on earnings from stock trading and on dividend income. The
75-share index fell 40.25 to 3,816.09 in turnover of TL140bn.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Cash flows tighten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY flows were tight yesterday as the clearing banks resisted early
temptations to take up the Bank of England's offers of assistance and
preferred to take short-term money rates instead, writes Peter John.
Consequently, overnight money, which began the day at just below 7 per cent,
was bought up to around 8 1/4 per cent before moving lower at the close. At
the higher levels, the central bank offers became attractive again and 80
per cent of the forecast liquidity shortage was taken out. Three-month money
remained stable at 7 1/8 per cent.
Sterling futures returned to more credible levels after looking
extraordinarily cheap for the past few days. The contract for March
delivery, which tends to be the most sensitive indicator of the way interest
rates could be heading was sold off at the opening, reflecting the sharp
downturn in the pound.
It rallied later to end the day 9 basis points up on the day at 93.50 with
relatively thin turnover of 14,000 contracts by the official close. At that
level it reaffirmed the market's belief that a further half a percentage
point could be lopped off the base rate soon.
Bank of England operations were cold-shouldered during the early part of the
day with no help provided in the morning and only Pounds 30m of the final
forecast of Pounds 1bn liquidity shortage taken up at noon.
Among the main factors affecting the shortage were the take-up of treasury
bills and paper maturing in official hands, expected to drain Pounds 827m
from the system, bankers' balances below target and a rise in note
circulation. These were partly offset by exchequer transactions adding
Pounds 210m.
At midday, the Bank bought Pounds 5m of band one bank bills at the 6 7/8 per
cent rate and Pounds 25m of bills for resale on January 5 at 6 7/8 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 376m of band one and band two bank
bills, both at 6 7/8 per cent rate. It also bought Pounds 29m of bills for
resale on January 5 at 6 15/16 per cent. However, it was not until the
official close that the shortage was addressed and even then it was not
taken out. The Pounds 390m of late, unspecified assistance brought total
help to only Pounds 796m.
In Germany, call money was at 8.95 to 9 per cent in early trading. The
Bundesbank added DM6.5bn of liquidity to the banking system with its weekly
repo tender bringing the figure to DM77bn.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound records sharp correction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S recent gains were wiped out yesterday as investors decided that
the time was ripe to pocket their profits, writes Peter John.
The bizarre situation of the past few days in which the pound has
strengthened with no visible sign of fundamental economic support and the
dollar has fallen in spite of repeated nuggets of positive news was
reversed.
In a thin pre-Christmas market many currencies have been moved purely by
technical factors with multi-national companies in particular said to have
been keen to buy back sterling in order to balance their books.
However, comments by two of the senior economists picked by the government
to sit on a new economic advisory panel were seized on as a signal to sell
sterling. One of the advisers, Prof Wynne Godley, has argued that base rates
should come down to 5 per cent and sterling needed to be devalued by a
further 15 per cent. This prompted heavy selling in the Far East and
sterling fell sharply against the dollar and D-Mark at the start of dealing
in London.
By midday, it had tumbled four pfennigs to just above DM2.45 and had lost
three cents against the dollar to hit Dollars 1.5639. Then, the
blood-letting was staunched and sterling rallied to close at DM2.4650 and
Dollars 1.5665.
There is a divergence of views in the market with some analysts arguing that
the recent rise had nothing to back it up and others seeing 10 pfennigs of
upside over the next month or so.
Merrill Lynch says longer-term investors and asset managers were 'severely
underweight' in sterling until last week and have not yet had time to adjust
their positions.
The dollar, on the other hand recovered from a few days of pressure prompted
by speculators with long positions selling the US currency to square those
positions.
Dealers said the speculative presure faded yesterday and genuine buying was
seen. The dollar recovered to DM1.5705 from DM1.5570 but it was stable
against the Yen and Panmure Gordon's chief economist Mr Robin Aspinall said
laconically in his latest strategy review; 'The US economy is moving so
fast, it is almost trundling'.
The D-Mark also lifted, picking up against most of the exchange rate
mechanism currencies. There is a general feeling that the Bundesbank will
not cut interest rates when it meets today and the D-Mark gained against the
lira, the peseta and the franc.
The French currency continued weak in spite of some suggestions that the
Bank of France had intervened.
At least one dealer was adamant that the central bank had been buying francs
and another said it had been dipping in and out of the market all day. But,
others said that either they had not seen any intervention or that the Bank
was simply checking prices. The franc slipped to a low of FFr3.414 against
the D-Mark before closing virtually unchanged at FFr3.411.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: While Jordan's crops flourish
exports wither - Regional politics are badly depressing farm incomes in the
kingdom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN STARK contrast to other areas of the country's booming economy and
despite good weather and a high crop yield last season, Jordan's agriculture
sector has hit a slump.
Its exports are down by 70 per cent from the 1989 level, local market prices
have plummetted, and many crops are being dumped or destroyed. As the rot
sets in, the government's plan to diversify its agro-industries through
privatisation is failing to attract committed investors, while ministries
are bickering over the accuracy of official economic indicators.
Jordan's farmers, more than any other sector in the kingdom, continue to
suffer from political tension in the region as a result of the Gulf war.
Kuwait, which in 1989 bought 29 per cent of the country's agricultural
exports, maintains its embargo on all trade as a punishment for Jordan's
pro-Iraqi sympathies during the crisis. At the same time Saudi Arabia, which
received the lion's share of 41 per cent of Jordan's agricultural exports in
1989, has once again suspended trade amid claims that high levels of
contamination were found in a shipment of vegetables from last August.
Any hopes that shipments would soon be resumed were dashed last month when
King Hussein, in a speech to the nation, made a blistering attack on the two
Gulf countries.
The collapse in export sales has induced a dramatic fall in prices on the
local market. In some cases, fruit and vegetables can be obtained for half
as much as last year.
The Department of Statistics' projection for the sector's share of the gross
domestic product (GDP) for 1992 is 5.8 per cent at market prices, compared
to 7 per cent in 1990, but the effect of the trade hiatus with the Gulf
states, and how long it will last, is anyone's guess.
At least 7.3 per cent of the country's labour force will be directly
affected by the crisis. Although officials at the Ministry of Agriculture
dispute most of the figures from the Department of Statistics, they admit
that things could not be worse.
A frustrated Minister of Agriculture, Dr Fayes al Khasawneh, complains of an
over cautious private sector, lack of available credit, and sheer bad luck.
He fervently refutes that Jordanian produce contains high level of pollution
and pesticides.
'We tested samples of vegetables taken from trucks that returned from the
(Saudi) border and found that there were no traces of contamination
whatsoever.'
Yet despite his pleas on television, at business dinners and in public
meetings, the private sector refuses to offer any substantial investment in
what could be potentially lucrative agro-industries and supporting services.
Dr Khasawneh, whose PhD is in soils and fertilisers, enthuses about the need
to diversify Jordan's agricultural products by investing in processing
plants. 'My thesis is there should be industries built specifically to
process crops planted for that purpose,' he explains.
'Take, for instance, our tomato paste plants Why don't they produce juices,
sauces, tins, ketchup, the whole gamut?'
'Processing plants should be planned on a contractual basis and food
processing could include tinned beans, carrots, sliced grapefruit,
tangerines, fruit preserves, etc. If we had this then we could capture east
and west European markets,' he said. European markets presently account for
0.6 per cent of total exports.
Private investors complain firstly of regional instability. 'Give us peace
(with Israel) and we'll invest,' said one entrepreneur. They also fear that
the government will fix prices instead of allowing a free market
equilibrium. According to Dr Khasawneh, competition with the state is not an
option, although the government presently operates a minimum price floor
mechanism to support farm prices.
The lack of available credit from the state owned Agriculture Credit Company
(ACC), which offers nothing to exporters, and commercial banks, is the other
major disincentive for investors. 'For the last few years (credit) has not
exceeded 12m Jordanian dinars (Dollars 18.07m) from the ACC and a similar
amount from private banks,' complains the minister. 'This is
inconsequential. We require at least JD40m to JD50m (per annum) considering
our output is in excess of JD400m (per annum)'.
One positive outcome from the export crisis is that the country has achieved
self sufficiency in all home grown crops with the exception of apples,
according to the minister. However, with a food import bill of JD417.7m in
1991 in contrast to export sales of only JD86m, according to the Central
Bank of Jordan, this is little consolation to at least 20 per cent of the
population who receive their income from the agriculture sector.
While the deadlock remains the Ministry of Agriculture is calling for an
information revolution with accurate economic indicators and agricultural
data on which long-term strategy can be based.
The governmental Agricultural Marketing Organisation is frantically
searching for new markets to fill the void left by the Gulf states, the
farmers complain that they are victims of politics, and the private sector
continues to wait and see.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices down despite Saudi
reassurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES weakened further yesterday in spite of comments by Mr Hisham
Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, who the market should soon bounce back
from its current lows.
The price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery slipped by 30 cents
to Dollars 17.70 a barrel - its lowest point since March.
The price of crude oil is increasingly being dragged downwards by continued
weakness in the price of oil products such as gasoil and fuel oil.
The latest weekly report from the American Petroleum Institute on the level
of US stocks - released late on Tuesday - showed sizeable increases in
distillate and fuel oil stocks.
Stock levels of distillate, which is used to make heating oil, increased by
3.99m barrels last week and fuel oil stocks were up 2.28m barrels.
Demand for these products is usually high during the winter but this year,
mild weather and the economic recession has depressed usage.
Some refineries in the US are considering cutting production rates and
bringing forward maintenance programmes which in turn, will reduce demand
for crude oil.
Traders are looking to the weather to pull prices out of the doldrums, but
so far there has been little cold weather to push up consumption. The
reluctance of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut
output has also depressed prices.
'If it were an extremely cold winter and we were burning up a lot of
products, Opec might just be able to get away with this level of
production,' said Mr Paul Mlotok, oil economist at Morgan Stanley in New
York.
Opec agreed to cut production to 24.58m barrels a day (b/d) from 25m b/d at
its last meeting in November, but traders say they have yet to see evidence
of these cuts in the marketplace.
Under the agreement, Iran and Nigeria bore the burnt of production cuts. 'We
see no sign of either two countries cutting back,' said one trader with an
international oil company.
'On the contrary, they are still selling barrels from higher levels of
production in place before the latest agreement,' he added.
Mr Nazer yesterday was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: 'The oil
price will pass through a correction period towards a significant
improvement of oil prices.'
He went on to say that the price volatility was being caused by speculators
and that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting.

</HEADLINE>

After rising towards the end of November the Australian market started to
ease last week and the downturn became more definite in the past couple of
days. The market indicator there, which touched 541 cents ten days ago,
closed last week at 534 and sank in two days to 516 cents a kg by December
9. The November rise in the wool market brought out more interest in prices
within the trade, but only a limited amount of small scale business
resulted. Europe is still very far from convinced that the recession is
showing signs of coming to an end.

GOLD pared early losses and struggled to hold above Dollars 334 a troy ounce
in late trade, aided by a statement from Hungary's central bank that it had
sold gold in normal market operations and not from reserves. Gold hit a
one-month low fix of Dollars 333.40 on the London bullion market in the
morning on talk of central bank sales. Dealers said the market might now
benefit from a reduction in selling pressure from Australian and South
African producers as it slides below the key R1,000 level and tests the
ADollars 480 levels on dollar weakness. London robusta COFFEE finished at
fresh 12-month highs, with the market firmly back on an upward track after
recent consolidation. Dealers said the scope for further gains in the short
term would depend on the extent to which origins stepped up sales following
the price rise. COCOA closed just above the day's lows with the market still
on the defensive after Monday's weak performance. Chart sentiment has become
increasingly bearish in the last couple of days.

credence by joint survey

<TEXT>
A long-awaited report from the Dia Met/BHP joint venture has added
credibility to the diamond-staking rush in Canada's North West Territories.
BHP Minerals of Australia, which is managing and financing exploration for
the joint venture, says further drillcore testing indicates potential
diamond-bearing kimberlites beyond its original Point Lake find in the Lac
de Gras area, north of Yellowknife.
The Dia Met/BHP report was the first since Dia Met was listed on the Toronto
Stock Exchange on November 9.
The report covered results from restricted core and surface samples from
nine new kimberlite 'pipes' located last summer. It said 500 diamonds found
in the samples included 22.5 per cent over 0.5mm diameter and the rest micro
diamonds of smaller diameter. A bulk test of two more pipes is planned this
winter.
'This will give carats per 100 tonnes and an indication of gem quality,'
said David James, mining analyst with Richardson Greenshields Canada in
Winnipeg.
The Point Lake bulk tests returned 101 carats from 160 tonnes of kimberlite
sample material.
BHP warned again that there is a long way to go before the deposits could be
proved commercial.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (10): Brought up to date -
Alan Pike talks to the Charity Commission head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD FRIES, who took charge of the Charity Commission in June,
disputes the frequently-quoted remark that the organisation is 20 years out
of date.
'Whoever first said that had it wrong,' he says. 'Ten years ago it would
have been more accurate to say the commission was 50 years out of date. Now
it is up to date.'
Record-keeping was at the heart of the commission's old problems. These were
maintained manually and, with 170,000 registered charities in the country,
it sank beneath the impossible task of keeping a valid, accurate register.
Now the register has been computerised, and the commission is equipped to
maintain and update the information on which all its other activities
depend.
The big test in building up the commission's new electronic date base will
be to ensure that charities abide by the requirements of this year's
Charities Act to submit annual reports and accounts to the commission.
Traditionally only about 10 per cent did so, although this has built up to
about 30 per cent during recent publicity about the new requirements.
This year's new Charities Act extends the powers of the Charity
Commissioners to regulate charities, their staff, officers and trustees.
Some of these powers are substantial - the charity commissioners can in
appropriate cases suspend and remove trustees and employees; they can
appoint receivers and managers and apply for winding-up orders.
While the act has made the commission into a stronger regulatory body for
the sector, Fries is anxious that it should not only be seen as fulfilling a
legalistic role. This is, he says, the last resort.
The commission is also responsible for promoting the effective use of
charitable resources and encouraging good administration.
Richard Fries hopes that the greater opportunities for monitoring offered by
computerisation will enable the commission to detect early warnings of
problems and offer support and advice.
He took a knowledge of charities to his new post at the commission. He had
been the Home Office official responsible for the voluntary sector, equal
opportunities and race relations, and was appointed in competition with
candidates from outside the civil service. Contacts made during his previous
responsibilities for race relations will, he hopes, enable him to encourage
more people from Britain's ethnic minority communities, who are
under-represented among charity trustees, to seek office.
The preparation of trustees for their new responsibilities under the act is
another of the commission's immediate concerns.
Fries says he finds the results of a recent survey by the National Council
for Voluntary Organisations, showing that two-thirds of charity management
committee members did not know whether or not they were trustees,
'absolutely plausible.'
Two new publications - a trustees' guide to the new law and a booklet on the
responsibilities of trustees - have been issued by the commission. Some of
the commission's previous publications have certainly been criticised for
looking 20 years out of date and Fries, as part of his attempts to make the
commission into a supportive agency offering advice and assistance to the
voluntary sector, has ensured that the new ones are more attractive and
comprehensible.
'To be a charity trustee is not a position of honour without
responsibility,' warns the commission's trustees booklet. 'It requires time,
understanding and effort.'
The stronger legal controls, together with the loss of the Official
Custodian's services, are likely to prompt some smaller charities into
mergers. Fries says he would not be surprised if the eventual number of
charities on the register came down below the current 170,000, but would not
like to see excessive movement towards charity amalgamations.
'We need charities to be efficient, but they have to be efficient within the
context of the actual needs of the voluntary sector.
'Small local voluntary organisations make an essential contribution across a
wide range of activities. We need to maintain a balance between the small
specialist charities and the big service-delivery organisations. The variety
of the sector, including the variety of size of charities, is one of its
strengths.'
At present the charity commission does not charge for any of its services
except the provision of information from the registers and copies of
documents. Under the new Act, the Home Secretary could by regulation allow
the commission to charge charities for other services it provides.
Fries is determined to approach the subject of charging fees with caution.
It is eventually possible, he suggests, that the commission might offer some
consultancy-type services for which it would be reasonably to charge.
'But I feel that the basic services are likely to remain free. I think it
would cause some concern if the public were donating money to charities and
it was coming back to the government in fees to the charity commission.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (9): Don't just sit back -
Andrew Jack examines the role of trustees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Kingsley Napley, a firm of solicitors, issued a booklet recently on the
legal duties of charity trustees it had no idea of the level of response
this would provoke. The firm's London office has since been bombarded with
telephone calls and written requests for copies.
At a time when the need for charity trustees to take their responsibilities
seriously has never been greater, the incident is an illustration of the
extent of current ignorance of their role. A recent survey by the National
Council for Voluntary Organisations showed that few charity trustees had a
clear view of their responsibilities. Only one-third of the members of
charity management committees were even aware that they were trustees.
Under present law, Britain's estimated 1m charity trustees have wide-ranging
legal, financial and managerial responsibilities. Of them all, the most
worrying is that a trustee could face personal bankruptcy in order to meet
outstanding debts incurred by the charity. This is true in spite of the fact
that trustees usually give their time voluntarily, with no thought of
personal gain. (In fact the law itself prevents them from receiving payment
for their labours.)
The 1992 Charities Act has added to existing obligations by including
additional requirements on financial reporting and annual auditing,
fund-raising and administration.
Mr Tony Sacker, head of the charities group at Kingsley Napley, says that
for the first time he is now dealing with several cases of charity trustees
who face personal legal action to recover funds.
'People's first reaction, when I tell them their obligations, is that I must
have got it wrong,' he says. 'They can't believe it.'
It is not so much that the new legislation has brought aggressiveness;
rather that there is increasing willingness by creditors (such as landlords
and banks) to take action to recover outstanding debts. Moreover, in an era
of declining government grants, charity trustees might even find themselves
liable for staff redundancy payments if they have to close or reduce the
operations of a charity.
'Trustee' may be more widely defined than those persons who simply have the
name attached. Trustees normally also include executive committee members
and, more widely, the council members who delegate powers to this executive.
Guidance on who are the trustees of a charity's assets comes from the legal
trust deed or memorandum which formally governs the charity.
But what action can trustees take to protect themselves against legal action
and personal liability? Mr Sacker says: 'When you realise you've got a
problem it's usually too late.'
The greatest protection for trustees, he says, is to act only for charities
which are limited by guarantee and governed by the requirements of the
Companies Acts. This grants to trustees a protection similar to that of
directors of companies, exempting them from personal liability.
But Mr Sacker says the catch is that few charities want to incur the
administrative difficulties or the audit and other costs of incorporation
when they are first created. And once a charity is running successfully,
trustees are equally reluctant to incur the additional burdens of
re-establishing their organisation as a corporation.
Charities which have sufficient assets to cover their liabilities - even if
that means curtailing their operations - will generally be able to liquidate
these before the need for trustees to dip into their own pockets would
arise.
The main safeguard for a trustee is not to enter into any commitments which
might result in personal liability.
For example, if the charity takes out a loan or a lease on premises, Mr
Sacker suggests that trustees should agree the ground rules in advance,
explicitly stating, in writing, that they are not willing to be made
personally liable.
As a rule, trustees are only liable for any commitments made once they join
a charity. If they sign a bank loan or a new lease without special
protection, they may leave themselves vulnerable to action. Normally they
will not be liable for actions made by previous trustees before they joined,
according to Mr Sacker. But they run this risk if they have signed an
indemnity to take on liabilities from out-going trustees when they first
join.
Even with all these safegaurds, trustees may still be vulnerable. 'In every
case you have to get into the detail,' says Mr Sacker. 'You could find
yourself responsible. These things appear to happen almost by accident.'
That leaves preventative action to ensure that a charity does not run into
financial difficulties in the first place. Kingsley Napley's book highlights
a number of points worthy of note by prospective trustees:
Ask to see the governing document of the charity.
Check the status of the charity and what it is entitled to do.
Meet the co-trustees and ask if they are following its purposes.
Find out what the charity's liabilities are and ensure they are covered by
assets.
Examine and get help in understanding the latest set of accounts, ensuring
they are informative and up-to-date.
Ask about any investments, in order to understand how well they are managed.
Mr Sacker stresses the need to keep the threat to trustees in perspective.
'I can't say the bankruptcy courts are bursting with charity trustees,' he
says. 'It probably will never happen to you. But don't just sit back and
assume that everything going on is fine.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (6): The aim is to be a
household name - Competition between charities means that image is more
important than ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a growing fashion for charities to change their images and, in some
cases, their names.
Image is more important than ever in the climate facing the voluntary
sector. Charities are competing for donations, public-sector contracts,
top-quality managers and the services of voluntary workers.
In fund-raising terms, a household name is a precious advantage for a
charity. Changing it is one of the most risky decisions it is possible to
take, and is guaranteed to split active supporters. Some organisations are
nonetheless taking this ultimate step as part of re-launch programmes.
All charities have to be sensitive to the views of the groups they represent
and support. The acceptability of the language in which disability and
disadvantage are described changes over time, and some of the recent name
changes reflect this.
But another factor behind the spate of re-launches is the perceived need on
the part of charity managers to adopt sharp, modern images for their
organisations as the voluntary sector competes for contracts to deliver
public services.
Both these elements were illustrated in the re-launch of the Royal National
Institute for the Deaf earlier this year. The name change was a modest one -
it is now the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. This enabled the
institute to satisfy the growing concern of people with disabilities that
they should be represented as human beings rather than a detached, abstract
group while avoiding the problems of having to market an entirely new name.
The institute accompanied the change with a clear bid for contracts under
next year's community care reforms, saying that it intended to concentrate
in future on providing services as well as campaigning. A specialist
organisation like the institute, it said, was the 'best channel through
which local authorities and health authorities can meet demands for their
deaf and hard-of-hearing clients.'
In October the Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults -
better known as Mencap - became the next big charity to stage a re-launch.
The most striking visible evidence of this is the disappearance of Little
Tommy - the sketch of a sad-looking child that has been the society's logo
since the 1960s - and its replacement by a series of confident, successful
images of people with learning disabilities.
'One of the particular difficulties of re-launching a charity is that you
have to sell the new image inside the organisation as well as outside, and
it is not easy to please everybody,' says Steve Billington, Mencap's
director of marketing and appeals.
Some of the parents who founded Mencap in 1946 remain active in its ranks
today; a number are unhappy about the modern new image the charity is aiming
to project. An even bigger controversy than the removal of Little Tommy may
be yet to come - there is division within the ranks of Mencap over whether
its name should be changed. In today's climate some people feel that the
term mental handicap is inappropriate.
A similar argument last month led to another of Britain's best-known
charities - the Spastics Society - agreeing to change its name. The term
spastic is considered by many to be offensive to people with cerebral palsy,
and one that presents a negative image of their potential.
A decision to change the name and re-launch the society was agreed by a 4-1
majority at the society's annual meeting. The Spastics Society is one of
Britain's 30 biggest charities, and most of the opposition to the change
came from speakers who, while not regarding the name with any particular
affection, were worried about the possible fund-raising implications of
dropping its familiar title and image.
A short-list of possible new names will be voted on next year. Suggestions
so far have ranged from the straightforward Cerebral Palsy Association to
names like Scope and Capability which incorporate the initials CP.
Some name changes can be relatively gradual or subtle. The Church of England
Children's Society - originally the Waifs and Strays - now promotes itself
simply as the Children's Society. Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for the
Disabled, following the pattern of the RNID, has become Queen Elizabeth's
Foundation for Disabled People.
On other occasions, a more radical approach is adopted. Four years ago, the
National Marriage Guidance Council re-launched itself as Relate. The
decision did not win universal approval within the organisation, and the
internal debate over the new name has still not entirely died down.
Advocates of change were concerned that the former title gave the impression
that the council's services were available only to people who were legally
married - which was not the case - and that potential clients were being
discouraged from seeking counselling. Opponents argued that the name change
might suggest that the council no longer regarded marriage as a serious
institution - which it does - and that the organisation would lose its
national credibility and identify.
Four advertising agencies were invited to put forward proposals for a new
name. More conservative alternatives, like the Marriage and Family
Counselling Service, were considered before the final choice went to Relate.
Shortage of funds has prevented Relate commissioning market research into
the effects of the name change. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the
number of people seeking its services over the past five years, but no-one
knows to what extent this arises from Relate's new image and how much from
social factors.
Relate went into the name change with the advantages that much of its
funding comes from central and local government, and that it tends to
concentrate in its public fund-raising on one-off events such as charity
film premieres.
The financial risk of a name change is greater for charities that rely on
widespread general fund-raising. Many people can name only a handful of
charities; a lot of money collected in workplace raffles this Christmas will
be donated to chosen causes simply because they have names that everyone
knows. For this reason the Spastics Society has decided that, whatever new
name is chosen next year, it will initially be used in tandem with the
existing one.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (8): Alarms and diversions
 -The national lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S first national lottery, in 1569, raised money to repair the Cinque
Ports. For the following 250 years lotteries regularly financed public works
and the Exchequer.
The historical precedent is not lost on leaders of Britain's voluntary
sector, who are apprehensive about government proposals to revive the
national lottery in a bill about to go before parliament. They have two main
anxieties: that it will divert money from other charity fund-raising
activities, and that lottery receipts paid to charities might eventually
replace other forms of public sector finance.
Furthermore, some charities have moral objections to the national lottery,
seeing it as state encouragement of gambling or even as a tax on the poor.
Surveys show that poorer people are likely to spend a greater proportion of
their income on lottery tickets, while some of the causes benefiting from
the lottery (such as the arts) are disproportionately patronised by higher
income groups.
The government apparently believes that the lottery might eventually achieve
an annual turnover of Pounds 4bn - at the high end of a range of estimates.
Once prize money and administration costs are deducted, the remaining
proceeds - probably less than one-third of total lottery income - would be
available for distribution to good causes. Such causes would include the
arts, sport, heritage and a special Millennium Fund for big projects, as
well as charities.
Charity managers are concerned that the public might buy lottery tickets to
support good causes and, as a result, withdraw from alternative forms of
charitable donation, without appreciating that the lottery proceeds were
going to sports projects and other activities that some people would not
regard as charitable. To compensate for the feared loss of income, a number
of the big charities have argued that half the proceeds available for
distribution should go to the voluntary sector.
Since the lottery is likely to go ahead, in spite of the concerns of charity
managers, the voluntary sector is now devoting its efforts to trying to
secure the most advantageous arrangements.
Two working parties - one set up by the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations (NCVO), the other by the Association of Charitable Foundations
(ACF) - have come to similar conclusions about the appropriate
organisational structure to administer the lottery. Government observers sat
on both working parties, and their reports are likely to influence future
decisions on the lottery.
Both reports call for a national board and regional structure, with separate
committees for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, to take
responsibility for making grants to charities from lottery proceeds.
A central theme of the reports is that awarding grants must be free from
government interference. Otherwise, says the NCVO, there would be a danger
of 'direct political control of allocation decisions by government' and an
increased risk that the lottery would gradually replace other public sector
funding.
The ACF says the distribution board should adopt a general policy statement
that 'lottery money will not substitute for government grants, nor be
directed towards the main areas of public expenditure.'
It acknowledges that there is increasing difficulty in deciding what welfare
activities are normal and proper candidates for public expenditure, as the
government tries to develop a mixed economy of care; but, it says, public
bodies should be excluded from direct benefit.
'It should be made clear that state schools, National Health Service
institutions, local authority social services and other public bodies cannot
apply for lottery support.'
Another common theme in the reports is that lottery proceeds should be
available to the widest range of not-for-profit and voluntary organisations,
and not restricted to registered charities.
Both the 1988 Local Government Act and the new 1992 Charities Act contain
broad definitions of institutions which - although not necessarily
registered charities - are established for philanthropic purposes; the
voluntary sector wants these definitions applied.
Whatever distribution system the government sets up, the question of
deciding which charitable causes should benefit from lottery grants will be
a complex and potentially controversial one. The ACF report says that, while
dividing the available money thinly between all 170,000 registered charities
and a similar number of other voluntary groups might appear fair, it would
involve charities receiving support irrespective of the merit of their work.
'Exercising some discretion in allocating the proceeds is essential to make
a more effective contribution to social welfare. Rather than allocating
money indiscriminately, grants must be awarded on merit, with an application
process providing the basis for initial comparison.'
Both reports argue that a proportion of the lottery proceeds should be used
to benefit low income groups. And, says the ACF, the lottery should provide
an opportunity to redress existing imbalances in the distribution of
charitable money by concentrating some resources on programmes that are
unpopular in conventional fund-raising terms.
Experience gleaned from state lotteries abroad and from UK appeals like
Telethon, it says, suggests that this would be unlikely to arouse public
resistance so long as the lottery funded more 'appealing' and 'photogenic'
causes as well. Indeed, adds the report, 'in many cases it is remarkable how
little interest is shown in the distribution of publicly-raised funds.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (7): Accounting for change
is only the start - Andrew Jack notes that new regulations reflect more
rigorous attidudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS will be in the ascendancy over the next few months in many
British charities, as a result of tough new legislation and a more vigorous
attitude from regulators.
Detailed regulations in the wake of the 1992 Charities Act, new voluntary
accounting rules for charities on which they may in part be based, and the
sharpening claws of the Charity Commission, will all soon make their
presence felt.
The 1992 Charities Act is the most fundamental. It has brought about even
more sweeping change than the most significant previous Charities Act, in
1960.
By next summer, the Home Office is expected to release a series of detailed
regulations; these are expected to apply from September 1 next year. At
present there is still some uncertainty over their content. But the
principal ones, concerning financial reporting, accounting and auditing,
are:
Accounting records: Proper accounting records must be kept for up to six
years. These must show day-to-day entries of all money spent and received; a
record of assets and liabilities; and other information sufficient to
explain all the charity's transactions, to show its financial position
accurately and enable trustees to ensure that it complies with regulations.
Annual accounts: There will be detailed guidelines on the form and content,
methods and principles, supplementary information in notes to the accounts,
determination of accounting periods and income thresholds.
Annual audit and examination: Accounts of charities with gross income or
expenditure above Pounds 100,000 in the current or previous two years will
require an annual audit from a charity auditor; those below this threshold
but above Pounds 1,000 have the alternative option of an annual audit from
an independent person believed by the trustees to have suitable ability and
practical experience.
Annual report: Within 10 months of the financial year-end, charities will
have to file with the Charity Commissioners, giving a report on the year's
activities and information on the charity and its trustees and officers. The
file must include the audit report on the accounts.
Access to accounts: The charity trustees must provide anyone who asks with a
copy of the latest audited accounts within two months of the request, on
payment of a reasonable copying fee.
These requirements are in addition to existing obligations for charities
which are incorporated and already comply with the requirements of the
Companies Act.
They do not all apply to certain 'excepted' charities subject to other
supervisory requirements; neither do they apply to 'exempt' charities, (such
as those with income of up to Pounds 1,000, no permanent endowment and no
use or occupation of land).
There is general agreement that the quality of financial reporting among
charities has improved considerably. Many larger ones already comply with
the new requirements of the Act, including the employment of an external
auditor.
The quality of financial reporting in smaller charities is far more
variable.
The judges in last month's charity annual report and accounts award warned
that many submissions still made elementary mistakes, such as not including
the accounts with the annual report, or failing to sign and date the balance
sheet.
With the introduction of the new regulations, charities face a double
pincer. The government's willingness to tackle charities with important
legislation has been mirrored by its decision to grant more money to the
Charity Commission.
That has allowed the regulatory body to begin computerising charity
accounts, and may have helped it towards an active role in financial
reporting and enforcing greater accountability from charities.
For example, the commission has pledged that 80 per cent of its list of
principal charities will have lodged their accounts by 1994. In 1989, only
11 per cent of the principal charities registered with the commission lodged
accounts.
By last year it had risen considerably - but it was still only 46 per cent
of the registered 135,000.
The commission has also taken a more significant role in new guidelines on
financial reporting.
SORP 2, the statement of recommended practice first issued in 1988, is being
up-dated. But while the original was driven by the Accounting Standards
Committee, the commission is taking the lead with the new version.
SORP 2 remains voluntary. But it is important, because many larger charities
feel obliged to comply with its guidelines, and because it may form the
basis of the detailed Home Office regulations on the contents of annual
reports and accounts next year.
Pressure from outsiders has called for amendments which would provide
greater information on, say, charities' sources of income; expenditure by
areas of activity; details of costs; valuation of assets; and consolidation
of subsidiaries.
Many charities have traditionally shown reluctance to provide a good deal of
financial information which may easily be misinterpreted. But with wider
realisation of the privileges they receive and the significance of their
assets, they are now being called much more vigorously to account.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (4): Charitable belts
tighten - Voluntary groups face reductions in local authority support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL VOLUNTARY groups, many already badly hit by cuts in support from local
authorities in recent years, fear that 1993-94 will be even more difficult.
Local authority budgets are going to be under severe strain as a result of
government efforts to contain public expenditure; the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations expects this to lead to further reductions in the
support councils give to the voluntary sector. It believes there will be
particular problems for organisations providing personal social services,
those relying on inner city grants and voluntary sector training providers.
NCVO officials have protested to Mr Michael Howard, the UK environment
secretary, at proposed reductions in planned Urban Programme funding from
Pounds 231m to Pounds 176m in 1993-94. 'Voluntary organisations are major
recipients of Urban Programme funding,' says Mr Simon Hebditch, NCVO
assistant director. 'It is another cruel blow to voluntary organisations
working in areas of high unemployment and social deprivation.'
Job creation, training, welfare, housing, advice, recreation, environmental
and education projects are all likely to suffer, says Mr Hebditch.
Even before the autumn statement, many local authorities had begun imposing
cuts in voluntary sector funding, freezing budgets at last year's levels or
refusing to accept any new applications for finance.
The overwhelming extent to which local organisations depend on public sector
financial support is shown in the first-ever analysis of sources of
voluntary sector funding in the capital carried out for the London Boroughs
Grants Unit, which awards local authority grants.
Although many corporate donors could not specify what proportion of their
national programmes went to London, the research concluded that private
sector support amounted to only around Pounds 3m in 1991-92 - compared with
Pounds 264m from local and central government, health authorities and
grant-making trusts.
London has some 30,000 voluntary groups providing a striking array of
services. But just over half the total funding was devoted to health and
welfare services and a further 20 per cent to education and training. Almost
all the rest went to organisations involved in housing, the arts, recreation
and the environment.
A Pounds 5m office, conference and resource centre for voluntary groups in
London is planned in the former Jones Brothers department store in Holloway
Road, Islington.
The venture is a partnership between the London Voluntary Service Council
and the City Parochial Foundation, one of the largest grant-making trusts in
the capital.
It is intended that the centre, which could open next year, will provide a
library, information service, exhibition space, conference hall and catering
and creche facilities as well as more than 16,000 square feet of office
space. Some low cost accommodation will be reserved for new voluntary groups
seeking to establish themselves.
Workers in London's voluntary sector are enthusiastic about the scheme,
particularly as it comes at a time of repeated cuts in resources. Mr Tim
Cook, clerk to the City Parochial Foundation, says it would put 'something
in place that will help hundreds of groups for years to come.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (5): Enlightened self
interest - Alan Pike reviews corporate community help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURED in financial terms alone, corporate support for voluntary
organisations remains a small drop in a large, deep ocean.
The median cash donation from the corporate sector in 1991-1992 was Pounds
152,000. During the same year Oxfam raised Pounds 17m from its charity shops
alone.
The latest Charities Aid Foundation survey shows that in 1991-1992, 213 of
Britain's leading companies gave assistance worth Pounds 206m to charities
and voluntary organisations - 41 per cent of it cash, the remainder in the
form of sponsorship, secondment of staff, use of premises and other kinds of
help. Although the support was important and in some cases vital to the
recipients, it was modest in the context of the total income of all
registered charities - more than Pounds 16bn in 1990.
Corporate support for voluntary organisations is, however, one of the most
sought-after types of assistance because it cannot be measured in financial
terms alone.
It offers voluntary organisations business contacts, opportunities for
partnership, access to specialised skills and potential for the professional
promotion of activities. Sponsoring companies can benefit not only from
improving their image among customers, employees and the wider community,
but by building community activities into staff development programmes.
Last year 48 companies gave more than Pounds 1m in cash and other forms of
support to the voluntary sector. British Telecom headed the list: its total
support came to Pounds 14.49m.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, said in a lecture last month that the
company believed community activities should be undertaken for BT's benefit
as well as that of the community. In the company's view there were clear
advantages in corporate community activity, flowing from the fact that its
business depended very considerably on the health of the community. 'If that
health is adversely affected by deprivation, crime, vandalism, racial
tension, inner-city decay, homelessness or pollution, so too is our own
business health. Our opportunities are reduced, our problems increase, our
costs rise.'
The company wanted to be seen as one with a genuine concern for the health
of the community, but platitudes and donations were not enough to achieve
this. It required the involvement of staff. 'Community involvement provides
an opportunity for people in BT to widen their horizons, to see beyond their
jobs, and to recognise the importance of the community upon which we depend
as a company.'
It would once have seemed a trifle vulgar for companies to admit that
self-interest motivated their support for charity. Today, such attitudes are
positively encouraged by enthusiasts for corporate community involvement.
Companies are more likely to take community activities seriously -
increasing the benefit for the community - if they see them in business
rather than philanthropic terms.
Many companies are establishing professional community affairs departments
and turning their voluntary sector involvement into a mainstream business
function. One consequence of this is a growing tendency to support
activities which have a logical association with the company's own business
activities.
Fears are expressed in the voluntary sector that this approach to corporate
sponsorship leads to companies restricting support to popular causes with an
attractive public relations image. This need not be so, as the Sedgwick
Group, insurance and reinsurance brokers, is demonstrating with a policy of
deliberately including within its community programme unpopular causes that
often find it difficult to attract sponsors.
These include organisations working with Aids victims, ex-offenders and the
homeless. The company's staff run a job club in Norwich prison, helping
inmates with the difficult task of seeking employment when they are
released.
Victoria Secretan, Sedgwick's community programmes manager, says that
less-mainstream voluntary sector programmes can still be linked to corporate
objectives.
The insurance sector's approach to Aids raises controversial questions, and
she says that involvement with Aids care has given the company a more
sensitive understanding of the issues involved. As part of its work with
ex-offenders Sedgwick has, in conjunction with the Apex Trust, Business in
the Community and Lloyd's underwriters, developed the Apex Bond - a fidelity
bonding system to help overcome one of the barriers facing employers in the
recruitment of people released from prison.
A survey of business and voluntary sector leaders carried out by KPMG
Management Consulting as part of this year's tenth anniversary celebrations
of Business in the Community - which encourages corporate community activity
 -found that, while 90 per cent of respondents believed the idea of
community involvement made business sense, 56 per cent found it harder to
identify benefits in the case of particular projects.
Lack of clear knowledge of the business case among business leaders was the
most frequently cited obstacle to corporate community involvement, and there
were calls for efforts to measure the effectiveness of projects in, for
example, reducing unemployment and raising socio-economic standards.
A case study of corporate social responsibility, produced for the Chartered
Institute of Bankers by Professor Kevan Scholes and a team from Sheffield
University, says the argument in favour of an active community policy can be
summed up in terms of good business. 'There is no real alternative, and a
positive social responsibility policy may be seen as enlightened
self-interest.'
The case against, says the report, is that 'pursuing active social
responsibility policies puts burdens on both business and society without
producing the intended effect of social improvement.'
The study examines National Westminster Bank, Britain's biggest corporate
supporter of the voluntary sector until BT overtook it last year. Market
research, says the report, showed 'strong staff support' - up to 98 per cent
 -for the bank's approach to community-related projects, with employees
seeking further progress on local initiatives. NatWest has recently
re-focused its community programme to reflect its business priorities, and
the report provides some evidence to support this approach. NatWest
undertook a series of inner city projects after the riots of the early
1980s; the report says there were marked variations in the success of these.
'The projects which succeeded best were those which related to the bank's
own business interests, such as training and technology, whereas those which
were least successful were those which were furthest away from business
interests, such as a day centre for the unemployed in Leeds. The latter was
treated locally with suspicion and cynicism. There was also a belief that
this project addressed symptoms rather than causes.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (3): New eyes on the City
 -Fund management has the potential to be big business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGING funds for charities suddenly showed the potential to be a big
business this year.
City fund managers, anxious to find a new source of funds, are offering
radically improved packages for charities, while the charities themselves,
in some cases jolted into action by divestment from the Official Custodian
for Charities, are looking at the City with new eyes.
But fund managers are keeping a sense of proportion. Estimates of the total
charities market vary, but it is unquestionably tiny compared with the money
invested in segregated pension funds.
The annual survey of the top 400 grant-making trusts by the Charities Aid
Foundation shows that these bodies control assets of about Pounds 7bn. Total
investment in charity fund managers stands at about Pounds 12bn, and total
long-term investments controlled by the charity sector account, according to
Mr John Harrison, charities director of Lazard Investors, for about Pounds
15bn.
By contrast, pension fund money accounts for about Pounds 300bn. Hymans
Robertson, the consulting actuaries, calculates that Mercury Asset
Management, the biggest manager of segregated pension funds, has Pounds
39.617bn total funds under management. Of this, charities account for only
Pounds 978m.
Part of the problem in expanding the funds under management is that
charities' needs vary much more than those of pension funds. Some are
endowed foundations which make grants. These will normally try to make
grants out of investment income, leaving the capital to grow.
This presents a fund management task wholly different from a fund-raising
charity, which has an irregular stream of income, used to finance on-going
commitments.
Furthermore, certain charities will want their investments constrained by
ethical or political criteria, requiring careful monitoring.
The fund management needed also varies according to the size of a charity. A
large endowed fund, with Pounds 1m or more to invest, probably needs a
segregated fund of directly held securities. The small charities which will
soon divest from the official custodian typically have large holdings of war
loan, or other low-yielding investments, and might be best served by
choosing a pooled investment vehicle, or 'common investment fund.' These
work in the same way as unit trusts, but with the significant advantage that
dividends can be reinvested gross.
Divestment has opened up considerable opportunities for these products as
the official custodian currently arranges for charities to receive their
income gross, but in future charities will need to go through the expensive
administrative hassle of paying tax and then reclaiming it. Common
investment funds would solve this problem.
The market is dominated by the Charities Official Investment Fund, COIF,
which is managed by Church, Charity and Local Authority Fund Managers
(CCLA). Other players include the Charities Aid Foundation, whose funds are
managed by Cazenove, and M&amp;G, a dominant force in the unit trust market.
Recent entrants include large fund managers such as Mercury, Schroders and
Fleming.
The potential influx of money from smaller charities should help to expand
the sector. But at the other end, the Wellcome Trust this year made the
biggest single injection of charitable funds, following the flotation of
part of its holding in Wellcome plc.
Wellcome placed Pounds 2.75bn of new funds with eight City managers
following an extensive 'beauty parade' of 237 applicants. Companies which
did not win a slice of Wellcome's money included Mercury - and James Capel
and Morgan Grenfell, which were both existing managers for the charity. The
winners included Baillie Gifford and Newton, both relatively small fund
managers. Hambros Bank will manage Wellcome's gilt portfolio, while some of
the UK's biggest money managers made up the rest of the list: Fleming,
Gartmore, Henderson, Phillips &amp; Drew, and Schroder.
The sector has also had to adjust to a possible change in the rules
governing the assets in which charities can invest. The Charities Act gave
the home secretary the power to relax the constraints placed on managers by
the Trustee Investment Act 1961. At present this requires a large proportion
of investments to be held in gilts and other fixed-interest securities.
No changes have yet been announced, and it is ironic that this extra freedom
could be introduced just as bonds have come back into favour. For example,
Mr John Thornton, of Glasgow-based fund managers Murray Johnstone, believes
that few charities will take advantage of the extra opportunities, both
because the need for income is important, and because it would be imprudent
to have a fund skewed too far towards equities.
Mr Martyn Bensley, charity fund director at Robert Fleming, agrees that
charity portfolios will typically have a higher element in bonds than other
funds, and will also reduce overseas exposure because of exchange rate
risks.
But the business of charities management is subtle. While many fund managers
have set up specialist teams for charity management, some companies with
pension fund expertise ask their managers to work on both pensions and
charities. This has some attractions as both investments are essentially
long-term, risk-averse, and in a tax-free environment.
Schroders deliberately asks its charity managers also to work on segregated
pension funds, and retains a heavy emphasis on equities, which it says is
necessary to protect capital and increase revenue over the long term.
Others adopt a different approach. According to Kleinwort Benson, linking
pension fund and charity investment is a mistake because charity trustees
think in terms of total returns, while charities tend to have a much more
precise requirement for income.
Mr Mark Summers, senior consultant with James Capel, points out that
charitable trustees are usually in position because they have a specific
interest or skill in the area concerned; by and large they are financially
naive.
'They are very often of a crusading turn of mind, which drives the desire
for maximum distributable revenue. Charity trustees as a body are therefore
much more akin to private clients than they are to institutional clients.'
Also, charitable trustees now seem to have a much wider choice than the
average private client.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (2): Small charities may
have to pool their resources - The new Act will bring important changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHARITIES Act could be the cue for a radical shake-out of the industry.
Many of the charities covered by the Official Custodian are so small that
they may not find it worthwhile to manage their own investments. Rather than
fail in their duty to help their causes as much as possible, it seems likely
that many will opt to merge.
According to John Harrison, charities director of Lazards Investors, less
than one third of the 40,000 charities managed by the Official Custodian
have an income of more than Pounds 1,000 a year. Charities this size will
not welcome the extra administrative burden; some kind of pooling of
resources could be necessary. Several other City fund managers believe
mergers are likely.
However, charity mergers are traumatic for trustees, as they can seem to
involve dilution of the original aims of the charity. Sharing and
streamlining of administration seems more likely.
Mr Pesh Framjee, senior charity consultant with accountants BDO Binder
Hamlyn, says: 'There's a point where you have a critical mass and it doesn't
make sense to be on your own. You have got really small charities which are
handled by trustees. If they get a little larger it's better for them to
have a full-time administrator. But that administrator could administer five
or six charities. It's become easier, under the Act, to do that, and before
that it was a bureaucratic nightmare. But I still think there's going to be
a grass roots resistance to this merger trend.'
Mr Framjee points to the growth of umbrella organisations such as the
National Federation of Community Organisations, and the Charity Finance
Directors Group which has 400 members.
These directors will need to plan carefully in the face of the recession, as
charitable donations - particularly of the directly solicited 'flag day'
type - are vulnerable to a downturn. Falling house prices can also be
expected to dent bequests, which would hurt another vital source of charity
revenue.
Mr Framjee says legacy income for charities fell by 1 per cent last year,
and suggests that executors' delay in selling a house because of the
depressed market could also cause cash flow problems.
Mr Andrew Hind, chairman of the Charity Finance Directors Group and finance
director for Barnados, points out that privatisations and redundancies
seriously affect pay-roll giving through the tax-efficient
'give-as-you-earn' scheme. Charities have built close links with large
companies, and will not find it easy to adjust if these companies then split
up.
Significantly, the smaller charities seem more vulnerable than larger,
well-established charities which have become effective trading
organisations, such as Oxfam (which saw its income rise from Pounds 91.56m
to Pounds 99.92m last year) and Save the Children. If the smaller charities
want to survive, Mr Adrian Randall, finance director of the Cancer Research
Campaign, says: 'More and more of them will start to get more involved in
other activities than straightforward donations and gift-giving. They'll
just have to come up with more and more innovative schemes for raising
money.'
The new philosophy is to justify to donors that their money is being used as
efficiently and effectively as possible in helping the cause for which it
was given. That, says Mr Hind, means building long-term relationships with
donors, and keeping them informed. Regular, committed donors will regard
charitable giving as one of their most important items of expenditure, and
will therefore be less likely to surrender it in the teeth of the recession.
The new disclosure rules for charities in the Charities Act, which bring
charities closer to the kind of standards already expected of quoted
companies, should also encourage this philosophy. Mr Randall says the Act
will 'bring charity accounts into the 20th century, if not into the 1990s'.
However, he is not alone in expressing concern that the Act may not have
been well drafted. In particular, the exemption from many requirements for
charities which are also limited companies could be used as a loophole, as
many charities are companies limited by guarantee.
The danger, according to Mr Hind, is that unscrupulous charities could hide
behind the Companies Act, and avoid the rigorous disclosure requirements
intended for them.
Moreover, the Charities Act will also require a substantial shift in
attitudes by charitable trustees. Many of them should soon be uncomfortably
aware of their onerous responsibilities.
Mr John Thornton, of Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund managers,
points to a report on trustees by the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations, which suggests that many trustees do not understand the
massive responsibilities they have taken on.
For more than half of the organisations the NCVO contacted, it was necessary
to explain what a trustee was, showing the difficulties which will also be
experienced by businesses in trying to make contact. Only one in three of
the trustees contacted actually knew that they were a trustee. As few as one
in eight had received personal training for their position as a trustee.
As the position carries with it potentially unlimited liability, this
suggests that charities still have a way to go before they can command the
same respect as the corporate sector. As the charity sector badly needs to
expand into the trading arena, it is not surprising that accountants,
consultants and solicitors, as well as fund managers, now see opportunities
in helping the sector fulfil the role which the government has now allotted
to it in the provision of services for the UK.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (1): Welfare at a
watershed - Charities are being called upon to deliver more welfare services
 -at a time when central and local government support for charities is being
reduced. Alan Pike examines recent pressures, including a new Charities Act,
which are making the voluntary sector more businesslike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FIFTY YEARS ago this week saw the publication of the Beveridge Report on
Social Insurance and Allied Services, which led to the foundation of the
post-war welfare state.
The welfare state developed an institutional structure - the disappearance
of charitable hospitals, the growth of local authority social services
departments - that made it look as though the ancient British institution of
charity would be relegated to a marginal role in society.
Half a century later, the position is very different. Charities are being
invited to become partners in the delivery of mainstream welfare services
that in recent times have become regarded as the state's automatic
responsibility. Demand for services provided by charities is rising as a
result of financial pressures on the welfare state. And recent innovations
such as self-governing trust hospitals and opted-out schools are drawing
state institutions into more charitable fund-raising themselves.
This watershed for charity in Britain coincides with another. Charity law is
catching up with a sector that, in spite of its collecting-box image, has an
income of 3 1/2 -4 per cent of gdp. Accounting practices, invest ment
policies, the responsibilities of trustees and charity management are all
undergoing the biggest re-examination of recent times.
The long-awaited new Charities Act was one of the last items of legislation
to pass through parliament before the general election. Its provisions are
being brought into effect during this year and next.
One central purpose of the Act is to strengthen the Charity Commissioners'
powers to regulate charities and respond to abuses - for example by removing
trustees and appointing receivers and managers.
Charities will face legal penalties in future if they fail to submit reports
and accounts annually to the commissioners; something many smaller ones have
neglected to do in the past. Other provisions in the Act tighten up on
fund-raising activities.
In an economic climate which is hampering real growth in charities' donated
income, much attention is being given to securing maximum return on
investments. The Act will add to this focus on investments and - although
charity investments are tiny compared with pension fund investments - the
sector is therefore attracting the attentions of competing fund managers.
Under the Act the Official Custodian, a public office which holds an
estimated Pounds 1.25bn of charity property, will divest itself over the
next five years of assets held on trust for charities. Smaller charities
will now have to appoint asset managers or - in one of several potential
pressures for charity amalgamations - merge with bigger organisations or
establish federal arrangements with other small charities.
The Act gives the home secretary power to relax the 1961 Trustee Investments
Act which requires a division of charity investments between 'wider-range'
investments in shares and 'narrower-range' ones in gilts. This would add to
the professional investment advice needed by charity trustees and - along
with many provisions of the Act - the skills required to function as a
trustee. Research points to urgent training needs to equip trustees for
their responsibilities.
Investments account for about 15 per cent of total charitable income. The
biggest source of income - more than half the total - is in fees and grants
for services. Donations account for about 20 per cent. The Charities Aid
Foundation (CAF) reported last month that total income of all charities, on
an upward trend since the 1970s, had fallen in real terms between 1985 and
1990.
This overall downturn is not reflected in the performance of some of the
biggest charities; the income of the top 400 grew by 6 per cent in real
terms last year. The CAF suggests that big charities may be getting bigger
because of their greater professionalism in activities such as advertising
and direct mail, and because they are less reliant than the rest of the
sector on government grants.
The government wants charities to take a greater role in delivering welfare
services. Ministers hope that many voluntary organisations will take the
opportunities offered by next April's community care reforms, intended to
enable elderly and disabled people to be cared for at home rather than in
institutions.
In a bid to stimulate voluntary sector involvement in public services, the
government's ministerial group on the voluntary sector has decided to update
and reissue guidance to civil servants.
This follows a report published by the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations (NCVO) in September, expressing disappointment at the slow
progress since publication of a government report in 1990 on funding for the
voluntary sector and its partnership with the public sector.
Mr Michael Jack, the home office minister who chairs the ministerial group,
says the government wants the voluntary sector to grow; it is committed to
creating a climate in which a diverse range of voluntary groups can
flourish.
'It is therefore important that government policies do not overlook the
potential
contributions of the voluntary sector, or inadvertently place unreasonable
burdens on voluntary groups.'
However, at a time when there is little increase in individual or corporate
donations to charity, the sector's immediate concern is over the impact of
public spending constraints on financial support from central and local
government. This is likely to be a problem for local voluntary groups in
1993; many are totally dependent on local authority finance.
There is also continuing anxiety in the voluntary sector about the possible
impact of one of the government's showpiece policies, the National Lottery.
Charity managers worry that this will divert income from other fund-raising
activities; an NCVO survey shows that a substantial number of people would
give less to charity and buy lottery tickets instead; charity will be only
one of several causes to benefit from the lottery proceeds. British charity
managers look apprehensively at the Republic of Ireland, where a national
lottery was followed by a fall in charity fund-raising.
While the recession has had an impact on income, there is evidence that the
sector is further handicapped by attitudes towards the role of charity. The
latest British Social Attitudes survey, published last month, points to
problems which both the government and the voluntary sector must solve if
they are to expand the sector's influence.
Fifty years on from the Beveridge Report, the view that the state should be
the provider of basic welfare services is widely held in Britain. The survey
refers to the public's 'persistent attachment to the principles of
collective provision underwritten by taxation.' This so-far-unshakeable
attitude makes it difficult for the government to succeed in efforts to
persuade the public to become more generous in their support for charity.
The problem revealed in the attitudes survey is that more than a third of
the public apparently believe that 'most are wasteful in their use of
funds.'
The new Act, the economic climate, a competitive market for funds and
contracts and recruitment of managers with experience in other sectors are
all helping to make charities more businesslike and efficient. When demand
for its services is out-stripping resources, the voluntary sector urgently
needs to find ways of communicating that message.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip ahead of inflation figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MODEST profit-taking pushed US Treasury prices slightly lower across the
board yesterday as bond investors awaited today's inflation data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 102
3/16 , yielding 7.436 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down  3/32
at 100 1/32 , yielding 4.591 per cent.
Although the market isconfident inflationary pressures are not building up
in the economy, despite signs of growing business activity, prices edged
lower as some investors booked profits earned in the recent rally.
Apart from the profit-taking, trading was subdued. The day's only economic
report was the release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book' - its
end-of-year survey of business conditions across the US - which confirmed
economic activity is picking up pace. After the report came out prices
recouped some of their early losses. THE Bundesbank's repo allocation
yesterday provided the main focus for the German government bond market as
the central bank injected funds and raised the minimum rate at which they
were allocated.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 91.58, rose to a high of
91.74 before ending at around 91.67.
Volumes were low, with around 18,000 contracts traded, as dealers warned
some market participants had closed their books for the year or were waiting
for the Bundesbank's Council meeting today and the Edinburgh EC summit at
the weekend for any signs of an easing in the key German interest rates.
At yesterday's repo tender for 14-day funds, the Bundesbank allocated
DM77bn, adding a net DM6.5bn to the market. The lowest allocated rate
shifted up to 8.80 per cent from 8.78 per cent last week, which reflects the
recent rise in German money market rates. The injection of funds helped to
lift the short end of the bund market, dealers said.
The Bundesbank is expected to announce its M3 money supply growth target for
1993 today. The market expects the target to be raised from the current 3.5
to 5.5 per cent range to 4 to 6 per cent.
CALLS for a cut in the base rate helped to lift UK government bonds early in
the session and the gilt market closed higher on the day.
Two of the seven-strong panel of advisers recently appointed to help the
Treasury forecasting team were quoted yesterday urging a 2 percentage point
cut in the base rate to 5 per cent. The news buoyed short-dated gilts, but
the fall in sterling against the D-Mark later wiped out some of the early
gains, dealers said.
The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 99.20 at the opening to end at
around 99.31.
JAPANESE government bonds edged higher, helped by short-covering late in the
trading session.
But traders said the market was focusing on tomorrow's Bank of Japan Tankan
report, the quarterly economic survey. The survey is likely to show
worsening business sentiment and could revive hopes of a cut in the official
discount rate.
The March futures contract rose from 107.70 to end at 107.84, while the
yield on the benchmark No 145 traded in a narrow range of 4.585-4.61 per
cent, ending the day at 4.59 per cent.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Eurodollar market continues to attract
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurodollar bond market remained the focus of attention yesterday as
several new issues met strong demand from investors bullish on the currency.
The two tranches of Citicorp's Dollars 2bn global offering of credit
card-backed securities, launched on Tuesday, were priced in line with
expectations. The margin on the Dollars 1bn two-year portion, demand for
which was described by Citibank as overwhelming, was set at 15 basis points
over three-month Libor, and the notes were priced to give an effective yield
of 18.75 basis points. The Dollars 1bn of five-year notes, with a margin of
30 basis points, were priced to yield 32 basis points.
To meet rating agency requirements, the credit is further backed by issues
of junior notes and cash collateral amounting to Dollars 78.2m and Dollars
72.8m respectively for the two-year paper, and Dollars 102m and Dollars
77.14m for the five-year paper. This is Citicorp's second issue of floating
rate notes backed by credit card receivables this year, and completes its
Dollars 5bn securitisation programme for 1992.
Strong demand was reported for Ciba-Geigy's Dollars 200m, five-year Eurobond
issue through Credit Suisse First Boston. Dealers said there is European
demand for three to five-year paper and this, from a quality retail name,
fitted the bill perfectly. The 45 basis point spread tightened to 35 basis
points by the close.
Lehman Brothers International said Abbey National's Dollars 100m one-year
floating rate issue under its medium-term note programme was priced
generously compared with commercial paper, at  1/8 point below three-month
Libor, as it was important that the borrower's first appearance in the
international capital markets since Moody's Investors Service downgraded its
debt to Aa2 be seen as a success.
IKB Deutsche Industriebank reopened an existing Fl 200m 10-year issue to
meet existing demand, said lead manager Rabobank Nederland. The second
tranche of Fl 75m, which brings the total raised to Fl 275m, was priced at a
spread of 50 basis points over comparable Dutch government bonds. This
compares with 55 basis points on the original issue which, said Rabobank,
marked the issuer's first borrowing in the sector.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Asia-Pacific sees capital
shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL markets in the Asia-Pacific region are largely underdeveloped,
volatile and ill-suited to financing the likely demands for capital in the
region in the years ahead.
These are the findings of a survey of more than 500 capital markets experts
in the Far East, Europe and the US, undertaken by Arthur Andersen, the
accounting and consulting group.
Despite high domestic savings rates in most of the countries in the region,
nearly 70 per cent of those surveyed expect a capital shortage in the region
later in the decade. Extensive development of Asian capital markets will be
needed to avoid such a problem, the study concludes.
Respondents to the survey, who included capital markets practitioners,
government officials and academics, pointed to the volatile nature of
securities markets in the region as a cause of concern. The problems are
exacerbated by the partial withdrawal by Japanese banks, which in the 1980s
had provided large volumes of cheap capital to borrowers in some other Asian
countries.
The study found:
The equity markets are expected to remain the dominant capital markets in
the region, due to the high economic growth rates expected in the years
ahead. The 'boom-and-bust' cycle in Japan and, to a lesser extent, South
Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and Thailand, will change as investors look more at
fundamental value and as institutional investment develops, Andersen
concludes. The result is likely to be a big increase in the demand for asset
management.
UK fund managers, through their historical connections with Hong Kong, have
been the fastest to develop business in the region, but investors from
elsewhere in Europe, and eventually the US, will also become important
investors.
Corporate bond markets remain underdeveloped, with the exception of
Australia and the efforts being made to open up the market in Malaysia. The
demand for stable long-term funds is likely to lead to greater use of
fixed-income finance. Undeveloped government bond markets make the growth of
corporate bond markets more difficult. In some countries, such as Taiwan,
government borrowing plans are so great they are likely to squeeze private
sector borrowers out of the markets.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Finland to inject further
FM15bn into bank sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Finnish government plans to inject a further FM15bn (Dollars 3bn) of
capital into the ailing Finnish banking sector next year, on top of the
FM28bn rescue package already committed.
Mr Sixten Korkman, director general of the Finnish Ministry of Finance, said
the estimate was 'on the safe side', so that further injections would not be
needed in the future.
The support package, set up in March, consists of FM8bn in the form of
preferred stock and FM20bn in the form of a guarantee fund. The package is
designed to ward off the threat of a credit crunch and prevent any bank
collapses.
Finnish banks experienced losses of around FM20bn this year due to the high
level of corporate loan defaults.
But the Finnish prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, said the structural changes
required to strengthen the position of Finland's banks were underway, citing
Skopbank's 30 per cent reduction in staffing levels and the takeover of
STS-Bank by Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's largest bank.
'The ability of the Finnish banking sector to rebound from its current
difficulties is largely dependent on the country's economic recovery,' said
Mr John Gibling, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency.
Analysts warned the scope for further potential problems is hard to predict,
since it is not known how many small and medium-sized Finnish companies are
still on the brink of collapse.
However, after declines of 2 per cent this year and 6 per cent last year,
the government forecast of 2 per cent economic growth next year is described
as realistic.
'Such a bounce from a very low base is certainly possible,' said Mr David
Longmuir at James Capel. 'But it will be up to the export industry, because
with unemployment running at 16 per cent consumers are very cautious.'
The need to inject further capital into the banking system, coupled with the
financial strain of high unemployment, will hold the government's funding
requirement at a high level next year. The borrowing programme, split
between the international and domestic bond markets, will total close to
FM60bn, according to Mr Korkman. But bond traders are not convinced that the
government will be able to raise half the programme domestically, due to
foreign investors' aversion to the domestic market after suffering two
currency devaluations in little over a year.
The level of borrowing is expected to diminish in 1994, assuming next year's
growth target is met.
Mr Aho also reiterated his government's commitment to re-linking the Finnish
markka to other European currencies, following the currency's devaluation in
September.
Moody's, US rating agency, has lowered the ratings of Postipankki's FM1.7bn
of debt to A1 from Aa2. The downgrade applies only to debt issued after
1988, since earlier issues benefit from a guarantee from the Republic of
Finland. Debt issued after that date benefit from a government guarantee
fund but 'the amount of support available is limited,' according to Moody's.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Sony's lean new manufacturing
machine - Steven Butler on a second revolution wrought by the Japanese
electronics producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SONY, the trail-blazer of Japan's post-war consumer electronics industry, is
famous for rapid product innovation - churning out hundreds of new products
incorporating the latest technology and design.
Now it is revolutionising the electronics industry in another way - by
adopting lean manufacturing. This year, Sony has cut by about two-thirds the
time needed to assemble a video recorder.
The significance of Sony's new style of production management goes beyond
the obvious reduction in manufacturing costs achieved. The new focus is a
sign - and an admission by Sony - that the fast-growing consumer electronics
industry has reached maturity.
Technical change in basic products has slowed to a point where there is
little reason to launch new products every few months. As a result, product
cycles will be longer in future, making it possible to organise production
differently.
Mr Yoshitaka Kato, general manager of production engineering, says: 'In the
past, our eye was always focused on catching up on technology to make new
products. But now, with the pace of technical change slowing sharply, 'we
can concentrate less on technology and more on manufacturing the product.'
There has been talk in recent months about the need for Japanese companies
to cope with the current recession by lengthening product cycles to cut
costs. Sony's innovation, however, is all the more significant because it is
unrelated to the recession and, instead, reflects planning that stretches
back several years. Sony engineers began to realise then that the technology
for many products, such as video recorders, had stabilised.
In 1988, Mr Kato was told to double production of 8mm video equipment in
three years but without increasing production space. 'By the end of 1990 we
doubled production by means of automation, but the cost was too high.'
Sony spent about Y8bn (Dollars 64.5m) installing automated assembly
equipment but concluded that manufacturing had become too complex and
costly. Last year, Mr Kato set out to simplify the manufacturing process and
opted for the 'lean' production system.
Since adopting lean production at its VCR plants in Japan in January, Sony
has achieved the expected results. Instead of keeping a month's supply of
spare parts on hand, it now orders parts 48 hours before they are needed.
The company has reduced by some two-thirds the work time needed to assemble
a video recorder.
Sony is also able to root out product quality problems quickly, since it
takes less time to put together a finished product that can be tested. The
system is being adopted throughout Sony's video division. Other
manufacturing divisions of the company are now also starting to look at it.
Mr Kato says Sony has not calculated precisely the gains in production cost
or quality, but says they are significant. This raises the question,
however, of why it took Sony so long to modify production.
The answer is that lean production is suitable only when product cycles are
relatively long. Lean production requires a higher degree of integration in
the production process, and greater co-ordination among a large number of
parts suppliers.
It is, therefore, relatively inflexible as far as the basic production
process is concerned.
Mr Kato says that Sony has, in the past, had trouble meeting some needs of
the market quickly, for example, resupplying a certain colour of television
set that had sold out. Now, with production time shortened, and parts makers
sending supplies on only a few days' notice, Sony can more quickly adapt
production to meet changing demand.
It also can, within limits, change housing designs easily to reflect fashion
trends, without altering the basic product.
The move to lean production implies another important change in Sony's
strategy. In the past, Sony's products were technology driven, with product
designers hoping new ideas would catch on with customers. Market research
was often neglected on the grounds that consumers would not have a sensible
opinion about an entirely new product.
Yet, with Sony now having less new in the way of technology, Mr Kato says:
'We really need to study the needs of consumers more.' All these changes are
signs the consumer electronics industry, and Sony, are reaching middle age.
Sony will continue to offer new products incorporating new technology. But,
for the bulk of the basic audio and video business, it will be more
important to cut costs and meet consumer need precisely.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Royal Trustco senior debt rating
cut by Moody's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, has reduced its
rating on Royal Trustco senior debt from triple-B (medium) to double-B
(high), pointing to problem loans in the UK and North America.
Royal Trustco is the holding company for Canada's second-biggest trust
company and is part of the Bronfman-controlled Edper group. Ratings were
also reduced for the subordinated debt of Royal Trustco as well as on debt
issued by the subsidiary operating trust business in all parts of Canada
except Quebec.
Moody's said it was worried that Royal Trustco's capital 'could be reduced
further by the need for additional write-downs against UK and US assets'. It
added the domestic operation had been affected by non-performing loans and
tight profit margins.
Royal Trustco replied it had CDollars 1bn (USDollars 783m) in liquid assets
while the domestic trust company had CDollars 2.2bn, well above regulatory
requirements.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Losses of Y9bn linked to Tokai's
brokerage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKAI BANK, the Japanese commercial bank, has admitted to incurring losses
of about Y9bn (Dollars 72m) through arranging investment deals for its
clients with Kosei Securities, an Osaka-based brokerage with which it has a
close relationship.
The announcement from Tokai highlights the links between Japanese banks and
brokerage houses, and has raised doubts about the extent to which promises
of profits are routinely made to clients. Tokai insists that it made no such
guarantee, which would violate Japan's Securities and Exchange Law.
Tokai does admit that loans were made to clients for stock purchases through
Kosei and that losses have been incurred through their inability to repay
those loans, made over two years from 1988.
The bank said it was unable to provide further explanation of the
arrangement with Kosei as a legal action is pending against the brokerage
from a textile trading company demanding about Y8bn in compensation for
losses on securities deals.
Compensation of favoured clients for losses was at the centre of last year's
securities industry scandals, which damaged the confidence of individual
investors in Japanese brokers' integrity.
Brokerages denied allegations at the time that the compensation was
necessary after clients were guaranteed profits, which disappeared with the
collapse of the Tokyo stock market.
Kosei, in which Tokai has a 4.6 per cent stake, also admits that the clients
were introduced by Tokai and used loans from the bank to purchase stocks.
However, it said that no promises were made to clients that the stocks would
be resold later at a higher price to other clients.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Premier Group earnings up 23%

PREMIER GROUP, South Africa's second-largest foods group, has increased
six-month earnings and stepped up its dividend.
Net attributable earnings for the half-year rose 23 per cent to R89.5m
(Dollars 30m) compared to the first half of 1991, and the dividend is going
up by 13 per cent to 36 cents a share.
Turnover increased by 21 per cent to R5.4bn from the restated figure of
R4.5bn in 1991, but Mr Peter Wrighton, chairman, said the performances were
not strictly comparable as the results of the Metro Cash and Carry
acquisition in the previous period covered only four months'trading.
Mr Wrighton described the results as 'most pleasing'. This is shown by
tighter margins, with trading profit only 9 per cent higher at R213m,
against R195m.
The group benefited considerably, however, from lower debt and lower
interest rates - total borrowings fell to R280m from R650m - reflected in
net interest paid declining to R17.7m from R39.4m.
Mr Wrighton said that while most divisions had performed satisfactorily,
certain sectors had suffered from poor trading conditions and reduced
consumer spending. In terms of trading profit, roughly 45 per cent of
Premier's earnings come from food, 28 per cent from pharmaceutical
operations, 12 per cent from wholesaling and 15 per cent from retailing.
The market was anticipating good results, with the share having risen by
more than 20 per cent during the past month. Premier is regarded as a good
defensive stock, which benefits during a recession from its focus on basic
foods and pharmaceuticals.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: IBM shares fall sharply on
speculation over cost cuts

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' share price dropped sharply yesterday and
the company's debt rating came into question amid broad speculation that the
large computer group may announce a new round of consolidation and up to
30,000 job cuts as early as next week.
Wall Street analysts said that IBM was expected to hold an emergency meeting
of its board of directors next week to consider a range of cost-cutting
proposals.
Some analysts predicted that these might include IBM's first involuntary
redundancies and the closure of several facilities.
There was rising concern that charges resulting from such cuts could force
IBM to cut its dividend.
'We expect IBM to conclude a dismal 1992 with sizeable further charges,'
said Mr Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch.
'The charge is going to be substantial enough and involve enough people so
that they will not be able to fund the dividend out of cash flow next year,'
said Mr John Jones of Salomon Brothers.
Mr Mandresh also said that IBM may accelerate its plans to separate its
operations into autonomous business units. The strong performance of IBM's
mid-range computer, computer workstation, service and software businesses
were being masked by deteriorating sales of the company's mainframe
computers, Mr Mandresh said.
'It appears to us that IBM's board must find a way to accelerate the process
by which shareholders can focus in on crisply presented results of the
growth segments of the company. We expect sweeping changes at IBM to be
announced shortly and we believe that if possible IBM will introduce changes
in equity ownership,' Mr Mandresh said.
Standard and Poor's, the credit rating agency, said that it was considering
downgrading IBM's debt from its current triple-A rating. About Dollars 9.6bn
of debt is affected.
'The rating action reflects increased uncertainty about the company's
ability to restore performance to levels consistent with a Triple-A rating,'
S&amp;P said.
Previously, S&amp;P indicated that fourth-quarter results and prospects for 1993
would be critical to maintaining the triple-A rating.
'Reports of further write-offs represent an additional concern,' the rating
agency said.
IBM declined to make any comment.
On Wall Street, IBM's shares closed at Dollars 62 5/8 down Dollars 2 3/4 .

GILLETTE group has agreed to pay Dollars 1.5m for the Wizamet razor blade

The US group has also promised to invest Dollars 7.5m in the loss-making
plant which once monopolised the domestic market.
Half of Wizamet's output is exported.
Poland's privatisation revenues next year are set to reach 8,800bn zlotys
(Dollars 578m), of which half will come from sales of companies to foreign
investors and public share offers.

TIME WARNER, the large US media and entertainment group, yesterday forecast
an average annual rise in its operating profits of at least 13 per cent over
the next five years, writes Alan Friedman.
Mr Geoffrey Holmes, a Time Warner vice-president, also told a seminar in New
York that the debt-laden group plans to bolster its balance sheet by
'monitising' around Dollars 3bn of non-earning assets owned by the company.
Mr Holmes appeared to open the door to asset sales or the issue of
asset-backed notes, including a 21 per cent shareholding in Turner
Broadcasting System, the parent of Cable News Network (CNN) controlled by Mr
Ted Turner.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics shows nothing
in the portfolio is sacred - Martin Dickson analyses the Dollars 1.525bn
sale of the tactical military business that consolidates Lockheed in this
segment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the second-largest US defence contractor, should perhaps
be renamed the Incredible Shrinking Company.
For the announcement yesterday that it intends to sell its tactical military
aircraft business to Lockheed for Dollars 1.525bn in cash is the most
remarkable move yet in a 14-month-long contraction of the company through a
programme of asset sales.
Businesses already sold off include Cessna, the light aircraft manufacturer
(to Textron) and its missiles operations (to Hughes Aircraft) but
yesterday's deal is in an entirely different category, since the aircraft
operations are widely regarded as the company's crown jewel.
The Lockheed deal therefore suggests that nothing in the General Dynamics
portfolio of businesses is now sacred. It is conceivable that it could
shrink to a small rump, holding a lot of cash to be distributed to
shareholders.
This policy of controlled liquidation represents the most dramatic move by a
US defence contractor to cope with the end of the Cold War and the
consequent cuts in Pentagon spending, which is forcing the US military
business into a series of mergers.
Only last month General Electric said it planned to sell its aerospace
division to Martin Marietta for Dollars 3bn.
Mr Jerry Cantwell, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, thinks that these two
big deals are likely to 'break the jam of defence industry transactions
waiting in the wings'.
The deal also represents a significant consolidation of US military aircraft
capability in the hands of Lockheed, one of the financially and
technologically strongest businesses in the sector.
General Dynamics' tactical military aircraft business, based in Fort Worth
Texas, will have 1992 sales of about Dollars 3bn and employs some 20,000
people worldwide. Its main product is the F-16 fighter.
It is also a member of the three-company team, led by Lockheed and including
Boeing, which last year won a Dollars 9.5bn contract with the US Air Force
to develop the F-22, a new generation of radar-dodging fighters.
The F-22 is supposed to take the place of the F-15 Eagle, the air force's
primary, but ageing fighter, and could be worth tens of billions of dollars
in sales to the contractors over the next 20 years, though rising costs
could eventually pose a threat to the aircraft from Congress. Mr William
Anders, the chairman of General Dynamics, has noted the programme 'could
ultimately become unaffordable because of the growing overheads and
fixed-cost burden' carried by the contractors.
Lockheed, which will now account for two thirds of the F-22 programme,
should be able to reduce these cost overheads, though Mr Daniel Tellep, its
chairman, gave no indication yesterday of how this might be achieved.
Mr Tellep did, however, say that Lockheed hoped to use the F-16's
international sales network to lift its own limited foreign aircraft sales.
Production of the F-16 is well past its 1980s peak, with the Fort Worth
plant building some two dozen this year in a factory designed for annual
output of 256 aircraft.
As US demand has diminished, the Bush administration has gone out of its way
to bolster production at the plant by approving the sale of 150 of the
fighters to Taiwan and a Dollars 1.85bn upgrade of aircraft serving with
four European countries. Lockheed said yesterday that the Fort Worth
division would retain its management and workforce.
Lockheed's aircraft group - with products ranging from the C-130 transport
to the F-117 stealth fighter, provides about a quarter of the group's
revenues.
Analysts had argued that it would benefit from greater mass in this area and
the General Dynamics deal would provide that, creating a Dollars 6.5bn
military aircraft business ranking first in the industry.
The deal, will, however, make it harder for Lockheed to meet its long-term
goal of a 60-40 mix between its defence and non-defence businesses, compared
to the current 70-30 ratio.
Some strategists argue there is little point in defence contractors trying
to diversify their way into civilian business to overcome the shrinking
defence budget, since their record in other areas is so poor. Far better to
bunker down and concentrate on running their core military businesses more
efficiently.
This argument has been embraced strongly by Mr Anders, who this year
announced plans to sell off non-defence businesses and concentrate on four
areas, which might be built up by acquisitions - tactical military aircraft;
armoured vehicles; nuclear submarines and space launch systems.
What has surprised Wall Street is Mr Anders's willingness to sell off one of
these supposedly core operations.
However, Mr Anders has complained that his efforts to buy businesses have
been frustrated by the reluctance of other defence contractors to sell off
sub-critical businesses. He warned that he would be willing to dispose of an
operation if this was the best way of keeping its franchise viable.
The Lockheed deal reflects this, and may eventually lead to another share
buy-back.

<TEXT>
MR Richard Braddock, who resigned two months ago as president of Citicorp,
the biggest US bank, has accepted a job as chief executive of Medco
Containment Services, a New Jersey-based business that manages prescription
drug programmes.
The 51-year-old Mr Braddock will take over in mid-January. Medco is the
leading US manager of prescription drug delivery benefits to corporate
employers and insurance firms.
Unlike Citicorp, which has Dollars 219bn of assets, Medco is a small, but
fast-growing company that was founded in 1983 and reported Dollars 102m of
net profits on Dollars 1.8bn of revenues in its financial year to last June
30.
Medco, which employs 6,000 people, is quoted on the Nasdaq over-the-counter
market.
Mr Braddock's appointment took Wall Street by surprise because he is moving
from such a high-profile position as president of the largest US bank.
Although the bank has never commented on rumours, many banking analysts
believe Mr Braddock, who began his career in consumer goods marketing at
General Foods, was pushed out by Mr John Reed, the chairman of Citicorp.
There has been speculation that Mr Braddock might be a suitable candidate to
replace Mr James Robinson, who last weekend announced his plans to resign as
chief executive of American Express, the financial services and travel
group.
Medco said Mr Braddock's salary would be about Dollars 741,000 a year.
He would receive an attractive stock options package for 1.25m shares of
Medco.
The healthcare company's share price rose by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 37 3/4
in early trading yesterday.
Mr Braddock said he decided to accept the offer at Medco because 'I set out
to run a company that was consumer-oriented and with upside potential'.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: GM faces truck safety probe
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US federal government agency has launched an investigation into the safety
of pick-up trucks made by lossmaking General Motors which could lead to the
costly recall of nearly 5m of the vehicles.
The action by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration follows
complaints from consumer groups that the trucks, made by GM between 1973 and
1987, have unsafe petrol tanks.
The tanks are fitted outside the vehicle's heavy steel frame and are alleged
to be vulnerable to rupture and catch fire if the truck is hit from the
side.
Ms Marion Blakey, administrator of the NHTSA, said the investigation did not
mean the agency had decided there was a safety defect. However, further
analysis was required.
There are some 4.7m of the trucks on the road and a recall to correct any
safety problems would be extremely costly for GM when it is struggling to
regain profitability.
The company has defended the safety of the vehicles but it suffered a
setback last week when the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said the
trucks had 'an unnecessarily high risk of fire'.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pirelli warns of further loss
due to recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, warned that it faced a further
loss this year, before extraordinary items, owing to economic recession and
continuing difficulties in its two main activities.
The warning came after an agreement last Saturday with government ministers
and unions covering almost 1,000 job losses at two tyre plants.
The company had previously cited delays in pushing through the redundancies
as a major obstacle to restored profits. Substantial closures and job losses
have already taken place at some of its foreign operations.
Pirelli made a net profit of L77bn (Dollars 56.2bn) in the first half of
this year after losing L105bn in the same period in 1991. However, it
stressed the 1992 figures were not directly comparable owing to accounting
and consolidation changes.
The precise outcome for 1992 will depend on how much Pirelli realises from
the continuing disposals in its diversified products division, some of which
have already been sold. The company said extraordinary items would be
positive, but their size depended on the outcome of talks on further
disposals.

net profits next year
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELF AQUITAINE, the French oil group, expects net profits to recover next
year after falling by around 35 per cent in 1992, said Mr Loik Le
Floch-Prigent, chairman.
He attributed the likely fall, from a FFr9.8bn (Dollars 1.81bn) net profit
in 1991, to the decline in the dollar's value, the fall in oil prices and
factors linked to the economic slowdown. These included 'very bad' refining
margins, 'considerable' overcapacity in the petrochemical industry, a
collapse in French demand for diesel and petrol during last summer's truck
strike, and a delay in fertiliser orders caused by farmers' fears of the
impact of European Community agricultural policy reforms.
Margins for all of Elf's products had been hit in the UK, Italy and Spain
because of the decline in their currencies against the franc.
Mr Le Floch-Prigent pointed out, however, that Elf's profits fall would be
less serious than that likely from some competitors. Oil production had
increased and distribution of special oil products and speciality chemicals
had done well. Elf Sanofi, the group's pharmaceutical subsidiary, would also
have a strong year, helped by its alliance with Sterling Drug of the US.
Elf Aquitaine planned to trim investments during the downturn but would
stick to its basic strategy, which has been to keep a rough balance between
upstream and downstream operations, with a slight bias towards production,
the group's traditional domain. Mr Le Floch-Prigent expected oil prices to
recover to around Dollars 20 per barrel next year, from Dollars 18.84
currently.

for Dollars 135m

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AGIPPETROLI, the petroleum refining and distribution arm of Italy's
state-owned Eni energy and chemicals concern, yesterday took a significant
step in the country's fledgling privatisation programme with a L185bn
(Dollars 135m) sale of 15 motorway hotels.
AgipPetroli also signed a long-awaited agreement with the UK's Forte hotels
and catering group on a joint venture to rent and manage the 15 hotels,
along with three others.
This will make Forte the biggest foreign hotel operator in Italy.
The surprise buyer for the properties is National Westminster Bank, of the
UK.
The bank, which will today inaugurate its first Italian office, has hardly
been prominent on the Italian property scene, which has led to speculation
that the portfolio may have been parked pending an onward sale.
Separately, Forte is paying Agip-Petroli L17bn to set up the joint
management venture, to be called Agip Forte International. AFI will
subsequently spend more than L70bn to improve and market the 18 hotels being
operated.
The scope of the deal is substantially greater than expected. AgipPetroli,
which is one of the Eni subsidiaries on the government's privatisation list,
will receive a cash injection in order to boost investments in its core
refining and distribution business and lower debt.
Forte, which already owns four hotels in Italy, will gain a significant
foothold in the business travel market.
All but one of the 18 hotels will be modelled on the group's UK Posthouse
chain, while the other, on the outskirts of Milan, will be run under the
Crest brand.
AgipPetroli has 40 hotels, built up with the development of Italy's
motorways since the 1950s.
The Forte deal covers those hotels not already managed by third parties,
while the sale to NatWest of only 15 of the 18 to be run by AFI is explained
by the fact that the remainder are either not owned by AgipPetroli or are on
rented ground.
Mr Pasquale De Vita, AgipPetroli's chairman, said the group also wanted to
sell its Nuova Scaini car batteries subsidiary.
The company, which lost L4.8bn in 1991, is the third-biggest maker of car
batteries in Italy, with 1991 sales of L37bn.
He forecast AgipPetroli would report 'a good result' this year, which would
be higher than the L78bn that the company made in 1991.
AgipPetroli, which recently opened its first filling station in Prague,
plans ambitious growth in its established markets - such as Italy, Germany
and France - as well as in southern and eastern Europe.
The group's current four-year plan envisages investments of around L4,600bn,
just under half of which will go on the refining side.
Mr De Vita said that the money would come from the group's own resources,
without raising new debt.

FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank brushes off
disappointment - Chief executive remains confident despite a 5% decline in
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT LOOKS, at first sight, as though the mighty Deutsche Bank has run out of
steam.
On Tuesday, Germany's biggest bank reported operating profits down by 5 per
cent, worse than expected. Deutsche's share price fell DM13.9 to DM653.1,
and continued to fall yesterday, closing at DM648.00.
The drop in operating profits - to DM4.94bn (Dollars 3.1bn) from DM5.20bn -
was hardly dramatic compared with the recession-blighted results of
Germany's biggest industrial companies.
But the profits fall was in sharp contrast with the sparkling figures
produced by Deutsche's competitors in recent days.
For example, Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-biggest bank, reported total
profits up nearly 17 per cent to DM2.37bn, while Commerzbank, the
third-biggest, achieved a 13.3 per cent increase to DM1.67bn.
Smaller banks reported even higher increases, suggesting that the German
banking sector has remained a haven of prosperity amid Germany's deepening
economic gloom.
The reason for this is that loan demand has held up despite high interest
rates and the recession.
This partly explains money supply growth has this year far exceeded the 3.5
to 5.5 per cent target range, and is indirectly one of the reasons why
German interest rates are at such high levels.
Moroever, the economic slowdown has not yet led to a significant increase in
bad debts - although chief executives of all the big banks have warned of a
sharp increase in the risk environment.
As Mr Wolfgang Strutz, senior partner of BHF-Bank put it a fortnight ago as
his bank started the reporting season with a 17 per cent profits increase,
the mounting risks hang like a 'Damocles' sword' over the whole sector.
Nevertheless, the question remains - why is Deutsche Bank doing far worse
than its competitors? Some of the answers include: Deutsche's size: in terms
of retained profits, Deutsche Bank is bigger than its next three competitors
put together, as Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chief executive, pointed out
on Tuesday.
As the bank said when the slowdown first became apparent at the beginning of
August, when it reported a 3.2 per cent drop in half-year profits, its size
means that it feels the effects of the economic slowdown earlier than its
rivals.
The profits decline is from an extremely high base. Last year, total
operating profits climbed by 16.5 per cent to a record DM5.97bn.
Interest margins shrunk by 10 basis points at the ten-months stage but, at
2.31 per cent, they are still ahead of those of other banks.
A shift in the bank's credit mix towards lower risk, lower margin interbank
business. This reflects the bank's conservative approach to commercial
lending, a caution which is likely to put the bank ahead of its competitors
as the economic environment worsens.
Currency movements - particularly the depreciation of sterling against the
D-Mark - shaved interest income. This was up 4.2 per cent to DM9.1bn over
the 10 months, but would have been DM150m higher if exchange rates had
remained stable over the year.
Disappointing results from own-account trading. Deutsche Bank earned DM850m
from its own market activities - more than other German banks, but some
DM100m less than in the same period last year.
Other banks managed to increase their own account profits, and analysts were
disappointed that Deutsche failed to extract maximum profits from the bund
market - which performed vigorously in the third quarter of the year - and
from the currency market turbulence.
These factors, however, do not completely explain why Deutsche's net
interest income climbed much more slowly than that of other German banks:
Deutsche's increase in net interest was 4.2 per cent, while at Dresdner it
rose by 10.6 per cent; by 10.3 per cent at Commerzbank; and by 17.3 per cent
at Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel-Bank.
Analysts suggest that Deutsche Bank is suffering from a 'normalisation' of
business conditions in eastern Germany. Both individuals and businesses
there now know enough about capitalism not to leave their cash in current
accounts, where they receive no interest. Analysts suggest that deposits
have been moved to interest-bearing accounts at the same time that lending
risks have climbed, thereby squeezing the interest margins on business in
eastern Germany.
How true this is cannot be evaluated from the published figures, and Mr
Kopper went to great lengths on Tuesday to explain that the bank had not
profiteered from its DM3bn investment in the east. Credits in the new
federal states total DM18bn, where the risks are often at 'the limits of
what is justifiable,' Mr Kopper said.
The chief executive underscored his confidence in the future by saying that
the bank's dividend for the current year would be held at DM15 a share.
He brushed aside comparisons with other banks, saying that Deutsche would
show its true colours in its full-year results, which are struck after
provisions for bad debts, and predicted that post-tax profits would be at
least as high as they were last year.
Mr Kopper also boasted that Deutsche - unlike some other large German banks
 -easily met tough new capital adequacy requirements which take effect at
the beginning of next year.
For all its problems with profits growth, Deutsche remains Germany's biggest
and most powerful bank. This will prove invaluable as the economy

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Blick leaps by 36% to Pounds 8.58m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Blick, the communications systems and time products
company, advanced 36 per cent from Pounds 6.32m to Pounds 8.58m in the year
to September 30.
Turnover expanded 30 per cent, from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 30.9m.
Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director, said that although some of the
increase had been acquisition-led, there had also been strong organic growth
within the group.
Further, the group had generated some Pounds 12m of cash in the year,
ploughing about Pounds 7m back into the rental base and fixed assets of the
business.
At the year-end net cash balances stood at Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 2.4m).
Having raised more money - Pounds 3.7m - in the March placing than turned
out to be essential for the Pounds 3.8m acquisition of the rental contracts
portfolio of GPT, Mr Alan Elliot, chairman, said he envisaged no more
borrowing for the moment. Since the year-end, it has picked up Electrelay,
which markets car parking and time control products from Amano, already
Blick's main supplier of time control products.
In communications, Mr Scott-Gall said it was exciting that Blick was now
selling to the public rather than just other businesses.
It has been renegotiating new cable and satellite television contracts for
the expiring ones bought in the Telefusion acquisition in May 1991.
Over the year the contracted future rental income rose 25 per cent to Pounds
85.3m (Pounds 68.4m).
In the time division, equipment sales slipped to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 4.4m),
but the customer base grew to Pounds 8.9m (Pounds 8.6m). Pre-tax profits
slipped to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.4m).
On the communications side, sales were up at Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 6.3m) but
the customer base more than doubled to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 4.5m). Most of
this was organic, Mr Scott-Gall said. Profits jumped to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds
1.9m).
A final dividend of 6.2p is proposed for a total of 9.2p, up 15 per cent.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hepworth raises Pounds 24m to fund Dutch
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEPWORTH, the building materials and home products group, yesterday raised
Pounds 24m by a share placing and announced the acquisition of a Dutch
boiler business in a deal worth Fl 28.6m (Pounds 10.2m).
The placing of 9.75m shares at 249p was underwritten by Henry Schroder Wagg
and sold to institutions in conjunction with James Capel. Hepworth shares
closed 4p up at 263p. The rest of the proceeds will be used to strengthen
the group's European gas boiler operations.
Hepworth is paying cash for AWB, an Eindhoven-based subsidiary of Mignot de
Bloeck, which makes combination boilers and gas-fired radiators. AWB last
year incurred an operating loss of Pounds 500,000 on sales of Pounds 13.5m,
and had net assets of Pounds 4.8m.
Hepworth is also buying the technical expertise, customer stock and certain
other assets of Kiddy, a subsidiary of Meppeler Machinefabriek, which makes
high-efficiency condenser boilers.
The UK group said the acquisitions would provide it with significant market
share and strong brand position in the Netherlands, which it estimated as
the fourth largest market for combination boilers in Europe.
Hepworth is one of the largest gas boiler businesses in Europe through its
subsidiaries, Saunier Duval and Hepworth Heating. It said a manufacturing
plant in the Netherlands would enhance its ability to service the Dutch
market and give it access to new technology in condensing boilers and more
products.
When reporting a 7 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits in July,
Hepworth said the trading outlook for the remainder of the year was
extremely difficult. The group said yesterday that since then, trading
conditions had worsened in some UK markets, although Saunier Duval had
continued to perform well.
Last year Hepworth recorded earnings per share of 24.3p. Despite the fact
that earnings had been affected by difficult trading conditions and by
significant exceptional costs, the board said it expected earnings in the
current year to exceed the 14.85p level of last year's total dividend and
said the distribution would be maintained.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring benefits at Avon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVON RUBBER announced a 36 per cent jump in profits, before exceptionals, to
Pounds 9.15m as the components and tyre manufacturer reaped the benefits of
a year-long restructuring programme.
Sales rose less sharply, from Pounds 227.2m to Pounds 232.2m, for the 12
months to October 3.
At the pre-tax level profit came to Pounds 9.36m, compared with Pounds
965,000 after exceptionals of Pounds 5.76m.
Project Nova, code-name for the restructuring, yielded cost savings of
Pounds 3.5m in the year. Mr John Harper, finance director, said Avon
expected to benefit by a further Pounds 2.5m this year.
Total restructuring costs would not exceed last year's exceptional
provision. In the year just ended, Avon benefited from a small exceptional
gain of Pounds 208,000.
Strongest performance came from the tyre business, which manufactures high
performance products for the racing industry. Operating profits rose by
Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 4.8m, helped by higher exports.
Cadillac, the group's US car parts subsidiary, jumped Pounds 2.3m to Pounds
4.1m at the operating level. Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive, said he was
confident Cadillac had increased its share of the automotive market, with
sales 19 per cent higher compared with a sector rise of just 9 per cent.
Mr Mitchard said there was just one cloud over Cadillac's horizon. Avon was
'somewhat concerned about some aspects of its business with General Motors',
which accounts for 30 per cent of Cadillac sales.
It was likely, he said, that the vehicle manufacturer would try to put
pressure on suppliers for lower prices. The group was actively seeking to
expand Cadillac's non-automotive business, such as rubber grips for golf
clubs.
The inflatables business had been turned round from a Pounds 1.8m loss to a
minor profit.
Geographically, Mr Mitchard said the UK was Avon's most depressed market
with profits down by Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 4.9m. The previous year had
benefited from the Gulf war.
By contrast, continental Europe and the US had improved significantly. Mr
Mitchard warned, however, there were signs of worsening conditions in
Europe, particularly in Germany.
The final dividend is maintained at 11.5p for a total of 16.5p, the same as
last year. Earnings per share improved from 1p to 29.2p.
COMMENT
Avon has won at least half the battle, with a well-managed restructuring
completed on budget and on time. The good results helped to fuel the shares'
rise from 410p to 435p. However, there are still some hefty questions
hanging over the group, as evidenced by Avon's cautious approach to the
dividend. Any improvement in the US economy - which appears to be the only
real bright spot for 1993 - is likely to be depressed by price pressures
from manufacturers such as General Motors. The same scenario is almost
inevitable in Europe this year. On the other hand, Avon has spent good money
on growth projects such as the joint ventures in air conditioning and
anti-vibration. Forecasts are for about Pounds 11m with a prospective p/e of
some 12.5. The shares look fully valued for the moment.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Airsprung Furniture shows 37% advance to
Pounds 2.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRSPRUNG Furniture, the Wiltshire-based supplier of beds and upholstery,
reported a 37 per cent jump in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds
2.32m, in the half year to September 30.
The group, whose shares will become a constituent of the FT-A All-Share
Index in January just 18 months after joining the main market from the USM,
is paying an interim dividend of 3.15p (2.63p), payable from earnings per
share of 11.82p (9.82p).
Turnover expanded from Pounds 26.9m to Pounds 28.6m.
Mr Michael Coppel, chief executive, said solving production problems at the
pine furniture factory and a 69 per cent increase in sales from the
contracts division underpinned the performance.
A Pounds 440,000 swing from interest charges of Pounds 335,000 to receipts
of Pounds 105,000 reflected tight cash management and the Pounds 3.2m rights
issue in mid-1991.
Mr Coppel said 'good business sense' had pulled Airsprung through the
recession, and the prospect of improving exports would help maintain the
interim performance at the year-end.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Profits warning clips Bullough shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, yesterday warned that
pre-tax profits for the year to October 31 would be about Pounds 8.5m, after
carrying costs of Pounds 3.3m for redundancy payments.
The shares shed 6p to 83p.
The decline was attributed to the worse-than-expected results from Atal, the
French subsidiary, where new management had initiated a redundancy
programme.
The group said yesterday that it intended to recommend an unchanged final
dividend of 4.3p for a maintained total of 6.05p.
In July, when reporting a midway fall to Pounds 5.89m (Pounds 7.18m),
Bullough said that full-year profits would be below last time's Pounds
20.8m.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind rise at Protean
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Significant contributions' from two sizeable acquisitions made in the last
financial year helped Protean, the laboratory equipment supplier and water
purification specialist, to report a near threefold profits increase in the
six months to end-September.
From turnover up Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 15.3m, pre-tax profits of the
company, which until February this year was known as Elga Group, surged from
Pounds 462,000 to Pounds 1.38m.
Protean also announced it was to expand further with the acquisition for
Pounds 2.1m of Epsom Glass Industries, a principal supplier to Chromacol, a
Protean subsidiary.
The acquisition follows the Pounds 300,000 purchase last month of DA Baldwin
(Water Treatment). The two purchases will be funded by a Pounds 2.5m share
placing.
The interim dividend is increased to 0.9p (0.6p), payable from earnings per
share of 3.74p (1.94p).

Good results from the US enabled NMC Group, which serves the paper and
plastic packaging and the printing industry, to improve pre-tax profit by
24.5 per cent in the half year ended September 30.
Mr Norman Gordon, chief executive, said the strong performance of the core
business - Universal Packaging of the US, which provides folding cartons for
high volume branded food items - together with the favourable dollar enabled
the second half to be faced with confidence.
Sales increased 20 per cent to Pounds 52m, with the US accounting for almost
Pounds 43m (Pounds 30.8m); profit came to Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 2.29m) after
increased interest charges of Pounds 738,000 (Pounds 320,000).
The company returned to dividends with an interim of 0.5p; last year there
was no final after an interim of 1.25p. Earnings per share worked through at
2.01p (1.01p).

John Tams, the USM-quoted earthenware and bone china company, returned
profits of Pounds 379,000 pre-tax for the half year ended September 30, an
improvement of 4.7 per cent over last time's Pounds 362,000.
A rise in turnover to Pounds 9.93m (Pounds 8.5m) in part reflected the

Earnings edged ahead to 1.25p (1.05p) and the interim dividend is maintained

distribution, resulting in a saving to the company of Pounds 236,174.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRYSIDE Properties, the residential, commercial and property company,
unveiled losses before tax of Pounds 11.7m for the 12 months to September
30.
That compared with previous profits of Pounds 3.05m and was struck after
taking account of exceptional provisions of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 1.2m).
A provision of Pounds 10.1m was made against development sites and there was
also a deficit of Pounds 8.3m arising on a revaluation of the investment
properties.
The latter was partly offset against the revaluation reserve of Pounds 3.6m
with the remainder of the deficit amounting to Pounds 4.7m charged to the
profit and loss account.
Turnover for the year fell to Pounds 79.7m (Pounds 87.1m). The contribution
from the residential side rose to Pounds 70.4m (Pounds 63.6m) while that
from the commercial activity fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 21m). Property
investment income was Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 2.5m).
Pre-exceptional profits from residential fell to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 6.7m)
while the loss from commercial was cut to Pounds 775,000 (Pounds 2.4m).
Losses per share emerged at 17.3p (earnings 7.2p). A same-again final
dividend of 2.7p is paid from reserves and holds the total at 4.11p.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Supply side helps Manweb to Pounds 37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPROVED performance from its supply business helped Manweb, the
electricity company supplying Merseyside, west Cheshire and North Wales, to
raise first-half pre-tax profits by 35 per cent from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds
37.1m.
Sales rose 9 per cent to Pounds 409m (Pounds 375m) and the interim dividend
is lifted by 12 per cent to 6.1p (5.45p).
Separately, Mr John Roberts, chief executive, indicated support for the idea
that the liberalisation of the electricity supply market should be delayed
if companies were to be asked to buy more coal-fired electricity.
He also joined other regional electricity companies in expressing scepticism
about the possibility of agreeing to a contract, covering either one or five
years, with generators prior to the publication of the government's energy
white paper.
In the half-year to September 30 supply losses were reduced from Pounds
13.8m to Pounds 2.7m. The company cited management of purchase costs as the
main factor, helped by a 15 per cent unit volume improvement partly from
securing contracts in the competitive market.
Distribution volumes increased by about 1 per cent, with industrial and
commercial growth offsetting a 1 per cent reduction to the domestic sector.
However, profits from this source fell to Pounds 40.6m (Pounds 44.4m),
affected by a freeze in prices.
Improved margins on steady sales enabled retailing to turn in a Pounds
200,000 operating profit, against a Pounds 200,000 loss previously.
In contracting, however, losses increased from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds
600,000, resulting from a 5 per cent fall in sales, blamed on the recession,
and the non-recurring costs of establishing a contracting subsidiary from
August.
Mr Roberts said the subsidiary was now trading at breakeven and profits were
expected from next year.
Pre-tax profits were reduced by provisions of Pounds 4m (Pounds 2.5m) to
tackle staff reductions. Mr Roberts said he did not expect provisions to
increase at the year end.
COMMENT
One of the clouds hanging over other regional electricity companies will
almost certainly lift today when the regulator exonerates them of blame in
the 'dash for gas,' and that may affect some of the sentiment surrounding
Manweb. As the one rec which is not involved in a gas-fired power station
its shares have benefited in recent months. Nonetheless, Manweb's place as
one of the star shares of the sector is unlikely to be changed either by
today's announcement or yesterday's results. Distribution volumes are rising
during the recession, even if the higher margin domestic sales are down;
supply business lost last year is returning and retailing is back in profit
when most other suppliers are still suffering losses. Contracting is a blot,
but that is a familiar story and new staff terms are already in place for an
improvement. The shares at 471p, down 2p, have a prospective yield of 5.8
per cent, assuming a 20.5p dividend.

PROBLEMS AT its diesel power engineering business were behind the decline
into losses of Pounds 46,000, against Pounds 42,000 profit, at Associated
British Engineering in its first half to September 30.
The group said that the Dawson-Keith subsidiary had been undergoing a
reorganisation and in addition had suffered from the effects of exchange
rates and an adverse sales mix.
However, the order was now much improved and a good recovery was expected in
the second half.
Group sales in the first half were Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 16.2m) and operating
expenses Pounds 17m (Pounds 16m).
The directors forecast that, subject to unforeseen circumstances, the
full-year would achieve a substantial imp-rovement over last time's Pounds
35,000.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Stirling Group leaps to Pounds 1.37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STIRLING GROUP, which aims, according to Mr Peter Sheldon, chairman, to
become a 'broad-based textiles manufacturer and distributor', more than
doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.37m in the six months to September 30.
The rise from Pounds 581,000 was struck on turnover sharply up at Pounds
45.6m (Pounds 26.1m), largely as a result of the first-time contributions
from E Gifford and Ritz Design.
Mr Sheldon said acquisitions were a large part of Stirling's strategy for
growth. In the period under review, it bought Boftex for Pounds 440,000 and
the Rigby &amp; Peller lingerie brand for 'an insignificant amount'.
In the contract division turnover rose to Pounds 35.6m. The closure of four
Bentwood factories following the Ritz integration was the only sour note.
On the importing side, which supplies C&amp;A, BhS and Littlewoods, turnover
declined 15 per cent to Pounds 7.9m after problems with a supplier.
Interest payable grew to Pounds 357,000 (Pounds 3,000) on acquisition of
Ritz's Pounds 4.5m medium-term debt. Earnings were 1.07p (1.03p) and the
interim dividend is held at 0.5p.

<TEXT>
THE GREENALLS Group, continuing its transformation from regional brewer to
national retailer and hotelier with a Pounds 108m capital spending
programme, achieved a marginal increase in annual pre-tax profits from
Pounds 64.1m to Pounds 64.4m.
The result - in line with market expectations - showed 'resilience . . . in
response to the harsh economic climate,' said Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman and
chief executive.
He said the Pounds 86m raised from a rights issue in October would enable
further 'careful and cautious' expansion.
Basic earnings per share for the year to September 25, excluding property
profits, rose 7 per cent to 29.6p. A final dividend of 6.93p raises the
total by 7 per cent to 11.77p.
Group operating profit of Pounds 77.4m was 6 per cent higher on turnover 8.5
per cent ahead at Pounds 529.1m. But the surplus on property disposals
declined from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 7.21m. There was an extraordinary
charge of Pounds 14.9m relating to the write-down in value of the group's US
hotels.
Pub profits, helped by rigorous cost controls and the acquisition of 39
outlets, increased by 6.1 per cent to Pounds 47.51m. Turnover was 6 per cent
ahead at Pounds 185.9m.
Beer volumes were down 5.2 per cent but food sales increased from 5.8 per
cent to 7.1 per cent of turnover. Investment in upgrading and expanding the
estate, which now stretches from the group's north-west base into the
northern Home Counties, totalled Pounds 30m.
Premier House, the catering inns and restaurants division, achieved profits
growth of 31 per cent to Pounds 8.4m on turnover up from Pounds 39.5m to
Pounds 43m. Spending on development of the outlets for the family market
amounted to Pounds 16m.
Operating profits from UK hotels fell 9 per cent to Pounds 14.2m. Occupancy
rates were maintained at 60 per cent, helped by an improvement in the second
half, but room rates declined 7.6 per cent to Pounds 48. Losses of the US
hotels were reduced from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 400,000.
Off-licences, with an eight-month contribution from the Blayneys
acquisition, maintained margins at 18 per cent while improving profits from
Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 4.5m. Drinks and services' profits were marginally
lower at Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 6.4m) but rationalisation and an agreement with
Del Monte for the production and distribution of fruit-based soft drinks
should improve profitability this year.
COMMENT
Greenalls has so far shown a shrewd eye for a bargain, picking up some good
hotel and pub assets from the receiver as it expands its operations
nationally. That provides a measure of reassurance for the market as it
continues its heavy spending programme with a budgeted Pounds 88m this year.
The Pounds 86m rights issue has strengthened the balance sheet, reducing
gearing from 27 per cent to 15 per cent. Internal cash flow should cover the
maintenance of existing businesses, leaving the group with about Pounds 100m
to spend on further acquisitions over the next three years without exceeding
its self-imposed gearing ceiling of 30 per cent. Analysts expect pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 67m this year, putting it on a prospective p/e of
12.6. The stock could be under-valued.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Grainger loses Pounds 4m on provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAINGER TRUST, the property investor and trader, yesterday reported a swing
from profits of Pounds 1.37m to losses of Pounds 4.42m pre-tax for the year
to September 30.
The figure was struck after taking account of an exceptional write-down of
Pounds 5.57m on building land.
Tax credits of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 234,000) left the after-tax deficit at
Pounds 1.92m, compared with a profit of Pounds 1.61m last time.
Losses per share were 9.56p (earnings 8.03p) but a final dividend of 4.05p
makes a same-again 5.25p total.
Trading profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 8.68m (Pounds 13.2m) due to
difficult conditions in the housing market. Turnover was also down, at
Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 34.8m).
Gross rentals improved by 8 per cent to Pounds 9.87m thanks to favourable
rent reviews and re-registrations; net cash inflow from operating activities
rose to Pounds 18.4m (Pounds 15.6m).
Mr Stephen Dickinson, managing director, said the group was not
disappointed. 'We think we've done extremely well in a very difficult
period,' he said.
The group has renegotiated bank borrowings, repayable over 15 years to 2007,
of Pounds 92.6m out of a total as at September 30 of Pounds 107.8m. The
group plans a substantial reduction in net borrowings over the next five
years.
Net asset value, adjusted for market value of trading properties, was Pounds
2.93 (Pounds 3.29).

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Background to the mysterious Mr Fixit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DIETER BOCK has established a reputation in Germany as an effective, if
mysterious Mr Fixit, with close links to Mr Ignaz Walter, head of the Walter
Bau construction empire.
In his greatest coup to date he played a key role in helping Mr Walter to
promote his company to the second biggest construction group in the country.
He began his real estate investment career in 1974 in Munich. He attracted
considerable attention in 1989 when his Advanta Management, a modest
property-based concern, bought a 10 per cent stake in Philip Holzmann,
Germany's biggest builder. At the end of 1991, he announced Advanta's
takeover of Dywidag, another construction concern, even though it emerged
later that he held only about 25 per cent of the equity, bought from Philip
Holzmann, at the time.
This subsequently finished up in the hands of Walter Bau, which held a
similar stake, and which finally won control of Dywidag in May this year.
Although the deal has yet to receive final clearance from the cartel
authorities in Berlin, Mr Bock, a lawyer, has been offered an option on a 10
per cent stake in Mr Walter's next empire-building project: Walter Holding.
This will encompass all the construction interests of Mr Walter and his
family - Walter Bau, Ed. Zublin, Heilit &amp; Werner, and Dywidag - in a group
due to be floated sometime next year. Total turnover is expected to be about
DM10bn (Pounds 4.1bn) a year.
Another more high-profile adventure brought Advanta a 50 per cent stake in
the Kempinski Hotel chain after the failure of attempts to merge it with the
Meridien business owned by Air France.
The deal was worth an estimated DM300m and again raised questions, still
unanswered, about the source of Mr Bock's finances. According to Advanta's
company reports, it made pre-tax profits of DM63.5m in 1991 on its main
businesses: 'conception, planning and completion of property projects.' Its
net asset at December 31, 1991, were DM200m.
Mr Bock stressed yesterday he was making his investment in Lonrho as a
private shareholder and not through Advanta.
He has a direct 20 per cent personal stake in Advanta, and is reported to
'have influence' over a further 60 per cent held by Dutch-registered
property concerns. The balance is held by BHF bank.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lombard North swings back with Pounds 89.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOMBARD NORTH Central, the National Westminster Bank's credit finance
offshoot, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 89.8m for the year to
end-September, shrugging off three years of poor results.
Earnings per share improved sharply from 12.8p to 31.5p, confirming the
turnround in the group's interim performance when it turned a Pounds 1.4m
pre-tax loss into profits of Pounds 44.6m.
The banking group, whose profits were eroded from Pounds 120m in
pre-recession 1988 to Pounds 3.2m last year, improved income before
provisions for bad debts to Pounds 245m (Pounds 175m).
The directors said net interest income benefited from lower interest rates
and greater focus on Lombard's profitable businesses. However, the recession
was still taking its toll, and reduced new business volumes saw a Pounds
500m reduction in net assets.
Operating costs fell slightly, but 'the general fall in demand for capital
investment and for consumer credit had necessitated major reviews of
processes and costs'.
Provisions for bad debts fell from Pounds 171.8m to Pounds 155.2m, although
they remained 'a very substantial drain on profits', the group said. These
provisions were unlikely to fall lower until the UK moved out of recession.
Lombard would be able to maintain the interim performance until its new
year-end in December, in spite of the absence of significant recovery in
industrial activity, investment or consumer confidence.
This is Lombard's second interim report as it moves accounting dates in line
with NatWest's December year-end.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad shareholders set to plump for an
embattled future - Michiyo Nakamoto on prospects for the computer and
electronics concern's depressed share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS shareholders cast their votes today to determine whether Amstrad is to
remain in the public domain, they will probably be asking themselves what
improved prospects may be in store for them as part owners of an embattled
computer and electronics concern.
Events over the last few days have made it highly probably that Mr Alan
Sugar's bid to take Amstrad private will fail.
Institutional investors who vote against the buy-out may congratulate
themselves in having made a point of principal - that management buy-outs,
particularly of companies where there are no independent directors on the
board to advise outside shareholders, are not desireable.
Individual shareholders, who could not get over a suspicion that Mr Sugar,
who holds a 35 per cent stake, was buying them out on the cheap, may enjoy a
sense of victory that they did not let him get away with it.
By rejecting the offer, shareholders are leaving Amstrad to trade itself out
of its problems, says Mr Patrick Wellington at County NatWest.
But what are the chances of Amstrad's share price recovering from the 24p it
closed at yesterday on the basis of a recovery in its business? Can
shareholders realistically hope to obtain more than the 30p they are about
to turn down?
The pessimistic view is that the chances of a recovery above 30p are slim.
The need for the company to shrink substantially in size, as Mr Sugar has
repeatedly pointed out and others have agreed with, means there is more bad
news to come, which could depress the share price further. If that happens,
it could be a long climb up to 30p, as one institutional investor noted
yesterday.
There is a strong case for Amstrad exiting the personal computer market,
which would reduce the business to about half its present size.
If that happens, the company will be left with a presence in satellites,
where competition is increasing, in low-end audio, where returns are
mediocre and where Amstrad's re-entry has not yet made much of an impact,
and in fax machines and video cassette recorders, both crowded markets.
On the other hand, there is a high probability that once it has shrunk to a
more appropriate size, Amstrad will return to being a profitable company.
It is still the market leader in satellite dishes, a profitable sector that
is growing at a rate of 1m dishes each year. This market is expected to
provide Amstrad's best chance of making reasonable profits.
While Amstrad has been out of the audio market for three years, it still has
a recognised brand name and with its experience and knowhow could do well in
a market which has provided other small low-end suppliers with a handsome
income even in a recession.
'There is always going to be a market at the low end for cheaply sourced
audio products,' one analyst pointed out. 'It's bread and butter stuff. They
are always going to be able to make money there.'
Meanwhile, the personal computer market is beginning to show signs of
turning the corner. While an upturn may not come in time to save smaller
suppliers like Amstrad, it might help the company to exit the market without
further write-downs.
Nobody is saying that climbing the path to a firmer share price will be an
easy task for Amstrad. But while Mr Sugar's reputation may have been
tarnished by recent events, his reputation for being a fighter does not seem
to have suffered much.
Although many individual and institutional shareholders oppose Mr Sugar's
offer, they nevertheless do not generally want the man whose initials gave
the company its name to resign. Even his staunchest critics conceed that
Amstrad without Sugar would face an even more uncertain future.
The consensus among Amstrad watchers is that Alan Sugar is not going to walk
away and that he will make a return on capital, no matter what it takes.
If that reputation holds, Amstrad's share price could start to reflect its
asset value of 46p per share, as well as budding recovery hopes, which could
appear as early as next year.
Meanwhile, if the company decides to withdraw from the personal computer
business and to hand over its continental distribution to third parties,
this could help to cut costs substantially, which would throw up more cash.
Shrinking the company would also mean that Amstrad is substantially
overcapitalised and share capital could be released to shareholders either
in the form of a special dividend or a cash payment.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Deal gives VW control of all four marques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN'S move to take over the importer/distributor operations for VW
and Audi vehicles in Britain from Lonrho for about Pounds 124m finally gives
the German car maker control of all its four marques in the UK.
Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, took over its UK distributor Seat
Concessionaires (UK) from Lonrho in early 1990, while Skoda, the Czech car
maker in which VW acquired management control in early 1991, announced last
month that it would take over its UK importer, Skoda GB, with effect from
January 1.
Lonrho said that it would receive Pounds 88m in cash, Pounds 31m through the
repayment of inter-company loans, and about Pounds 5m in the form of a
dividend for the final quarter of 1992.
It said that VAG UK had made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25.6m in the year to
the end of September.
The takeover is due to take effect from January 1, but is subject to
approval by the European Community competition authorities and by the VW
supervisory board.
VW said last night that the acquisition of VAG United Kingdom, which was
first disclosed in the Financial Times in January this year, represented the
final step in its strategy to gain control of its distribution operations in
all the main vehicle producing markets in Europe, Germany, Italy, France,
the UK and Spain.
VW's franchise agreement with Lonrho was due to expire at the end of 1993.
The way was first cleared for the takeover of the Lonrho operation in late
1987, when VW changed the previous two-year rolling contract to a six-year
agreement expiring at the end of 1993.
The terms of the contract change were never disclosed to Lonrho
shareholders, despite the fact that the business represented more than a
fifth of Lonrho's worldwide turnover.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad shareholders reject Sugar's bid for
privatisation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Amstrad shareholders appear to have firmly rejected Mr Alan Sugar's bid to
take the company he founded private again with a 30p-a-share buy-back offer
for the stock he does not already own, writes Paul Taylor.
Although shareholders attending today's Amstrad meetings could still approve
the deal if proxy votes were withdrawn and reversed, Mr Sugar's advisers
conceded that it was now 'technically possible but practically impossible'
for the bid to succeed.
Based on the 13,086 proxy forms received by 2.15pm on Tuesday, 7,827
shareholders or almost 60 per cent were against Mr Sugar's proposed 'scheme
of arrangement'.
Amstrad has 31,000 shareholders and under one test of support Mr Sugar's
proposals needed the backing of at least half those shareholders voting in
person or by proxy to proceed.
Under a second test of support, Mr Sugar also had to win the support of
three quarters - or all but 93.9m - of the 375.6m Amstrad shares he does not
already own. His bid has also failed this test on the basis of the proxies
received.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho debt has risen to Pounds 947m -
Reduction in borrowings significant factor behind German deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO's determination to reduce borrowings was one of the main factors
behind yesterday's deal with Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier.
Shareholders in the international trading group may be perplexed to learn
that net debt has risen to Pounds 947m.
In March they were told at the annual meeting that net debt, which would be
significantly reduced, stood at about Pounds 850m.
Since then the acquisition of a majority stake in Gewog, a German company
which owns 4,300 flats, has inflated the overall debt figure by Pounds 135m.
Lonrho yesterday said debt also increased by Pounds 54m because of exchange
adjustments to foreign currency borrowings and a further Pounds 24m in
respect of UK motor trading operations.
So in spite of more than Pounds 500m of asset sales earlier this year, at
the half year to March 31 net debt had only fallen from Pounds 1.1bn to
Pounds 903m.
It has increased again in spite of two further disposals:
Firsteel Group, a narrow steel strip processor and distributor, was sold to
its management for a price close to its Pounds 21m net asset value.
George Outram, publisher of the Glasgow-based Herald and Evening Times, went
for Pounds 74m to the management, backed by institutions.
However, some analysts believe the net debt is higher than Pounds 947m,
because the Pounds 500m from asset disposals earlier in the year included
Pounds 178m from the sale of a one third stake in the Metropole Hotel chain
to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company.
The group said at the time of the deal in March that the proceeds would be
used to cut the Metropole's borrowings and 'to generate further profits
through developments.'
Earlier in the year Lonrho disposed of its 50 per cent interest in Kuhne and
Nagel, the German freight forwarder, for DM340m (Pounds 140m). It also sold
Scottish and Universal Newspapers for Pounds 45m to Trinity International
Holdings.
Mr Mike Smith, conglomerates analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, said
Lonrho needed a rights issue 'because it has already sold the best
businesses and was clearly not going to make significant inroads into net
debt by relying only on further disposals.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: NFC slips 3% to Pounds 91m as pension
credits hit shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the transport and logistics group, saw its pre-tax profits fall 3 per
cent to Pounds 91m in the year to October 3, in line with stock market
expectations.
However, the shares fell 18p to 266p after the company revealed higher than
expected pension credits and a sharp rise in gearing.
NFC said it benefited from a Pounds 14.5m pension fund credit. This compared
with Pounds 4m last year when the group's pension fund was last revalued and
found to be 42 per cent in surplus.
Mr Trevor Larman, finance director, said the credit reflected a full-year
benefit from the revaluation and the fact the scheme had fewer UK employees.
He said the credit was almost cancelled out by higher redundancy costs,
which increased Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 11.4m, and a Pounds 7.2m fall in
property development profits to Pounds 5.6m.
But analysts said they were surprised by the size of the credit. One analyst
said he was 'caught off guard' because the credit was not mentioned in NFC's
statement to the Stock Exchange, although the company later explained the
increase at an analysts' meeting.
Mr James Watson, chairman, said that the results showed 'considerable
achievement' in a difficult year. 'There is some indication the US (economy)
is being more helpful. But the UK remains uncertain,' he said.
Turnover increased 3.6 per cent to Pounds 1.72bn. The transport division,
which includes BRS and Lynx, was affected by margin pressure due to
recession. Operating profits for the division fell nearly Pounds 6m to
Pounds 26.8m.
But logistics, which operates under the Exel brand name, raised operating
profits 23 per cent to Pounds 46.8m, helped by new contracts and overseas
growth. Allied Pickfords, the removals division, lifted profits slightly to
Pounds 23.2m by continuing to switch from private to commercial removals.
Pickfords Travel was sold to Airtours, the tour operator, in September and
earned NFC an extraordinary gain of Pounds 6.1m.
NFC spent Pounds 75m on acquisitions to expand its US and European networks
during the year. This investment, which included Pounds 34m of debt,
increased the group's net borrowings to Pounds 181.3m and lifted gearing
from 29 per cent to 55 per cent.
Mr Watson said he was comfortable with this level of gearing but would not
like to see it 'a lot higher'.
The emphasis on overseas growth, and recession in the UK, helped lift the
proportion of foreign revenue 4 per cent to 37 per cent.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 102.7m (Pounds 102.1m). Higher
borrowings led to an increased interest charge of Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 5m)
while the profit share for employees was set at Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 3.4m).
Earnings fell from 13.6p to 13.1p. A final dividend of 2.3p is recommended
to raise the total 5 per cent to 6.55p.

HOARE GOVETT raised Pounds 28.5m for the launch of its index-tracking

The bulk of the money was raised via a placing; just 521,000 shares were
applied for in the public offer.
The broker had hoped to raise a maximum of Pounds 50m via the launch and had
got firm commitments for Pounds 19.7m in advance.
It pointed out that the offer had raised more than recent small company
trust launches.
The new trust will attempt to track the extended Hoare Govett Small
Companies Index (excluding investment trusts) which comprised 1,477
companies at the start of 1992.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Costain to pay Hanson Dollars 5m
compensation fee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the construction group, is required to pay a Dollars 5m (Pounds
3.2m) compensation fee to Hanson after it cancelled an agreement to sell its
Australian coal-mining business to Peabody, a Hanson subsidiary.
According to a circular to Costain shareholders, the payment is a
termination fee and liquidated damages agreed with Peabody in the event that
sale was not completed. Costain cancelled the agreement to sell the mining
business for Dollars 200m after it received a Dollars 245m offer from Altus
Finance.
The payment is not linked with the legal dispute between Costain and Peabody
concerning abandonment of the deal. Peabody, which began legal action in the
US on November 10 is alleging Costain sought the offer from Altus and
breached its agreement by negotiating with Altus.
On November 16, Costain started proceedings in London against Peabody,
seeking a declaration that it was entitled to negotiate with Altus.
The shareholders' circular also revealed that the company's net debt at
October 30 has increased from Pounds 172.4m to Pounds 340.4m since the end
of 1991.
A substantial part of this increase resulted from refinancing of the group's
share of borrowings of Spitalfields Holdings, the joint venture company
owned by Costain, BICC and London &amp; Edinburgh Trust. This resulted in Pounds
56.1m of borrowings coming onto the group's balance sheet.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Isosceles to review trading strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the heavily indebted parent of the Gateway food retail chain,
confirmed yesterday that it would review its financial structure and was
seeking a new chief executive.
After a board meeting yesterday it said that it was reviewing its trading
strategy with the help of management consultants, and would then consider
'the appropriateness of the present group financial structure'.
The statement was seen as an implicit admission that a further restructuring
of the group's finances was necessary, only weeks after the last refinancing
was approved by shareholders in October. The group, formed by the Pounds 2bn
leveraged buy-out of Gateway in 1989, now has debt of Pounds 1.2bn.
As well as completing two refinancings the group has lost two chief
executives since the original buy-out. Mr David Smith, who led the buy-out,
left in September 1991. In October this year Mr Bob Willett suddenly
resigned as chief executive of Gateway.
Isosceles also admitted that Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes had been only a
stop-gap chief executive of Gateway after Mr Willett's departure. It said
that when Mr Mitchell-Innes became Isosceles' chief executive in September
1991, after Mr Smith's departure, it was agreed he would leave in 1993 to
devote more time to other commitments. When Mr Willett left the two chief
executive roles were combined, and Mr Mitchell-Innes will stay until a new
person is appointed.
However, observers felt that Isosceles would find it hard to appoint a
credible chief executive before its financial problems had been addressed.
They noted that Asda, another food retailer, had taken months to appoint Mr
Archie Norman as chief executive and he had only come after a rights issue
had been arranged.

FT  10 DEC 92 / US defence groups consolidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE rapid consolidation of the US defence industry took a dramatic leap
forward yesterday when General Dynamics an-nounced that it was selling its
military aircraft business to rival Lockheed for Dollars 1.53bn (Pounds 1bn)
in cash.
The business, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and has revenues of
around Dollars 3bn, is prime contractor for the F-16 fighter aircraft. It is
also partnered with prime contractor Lockheed, and with Boeing, in the
development of the F-22, a new generation of fighter aircraft meant to be a
mainstay of the US Air Force in the next century.
The deal is the latest example of a merger wave in the defence sector, which
is reacting to the end of the Cold war and a Pentagon budget dropping at
around 5 per cent a year. The two companies said the deal would create a
Dollars 6.5bn military aircraft company which ranked first in the industry
and was the second largest US defence prime contractor.
The takeover, which had been rumoured for some weeks, represents a sharp
strategy shift by General Dynamics, which said earlier this year that it
would sell off non-core civilian and military businesses to concentrate on
four key defence areas, one of them aircraft, and it would build these up to
'critical mass' through acquisitions.
However, Mr William Anders, General Dynamics chairman, said yesterday that
'after unsuccessfully pursuing possible alternatives available for purchase
or merger to obtain critical mass, this transaction was clearly the best way
to meet the strategic needs of the tactical military aircraft franchise'.
Analysts said this left open the possibility that General Dynamics might be
willing to sell off its other core businesses - which include the
manufacture of tanks, submarines and space systems - return the cash
generated to shareholders, and shrink to little more than a shell.
General Dynamics said it expected to have a net gain of about Dollars 650m
on the deal, which should be completed in the first quarter of next year.
Lockheed, which plans to finance the acquisition through short and long-term
debt, said it expected the deal to add immediately to both earnings and cash
flow per share.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Eagle Star to receive Pounds 450m from BAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance group, is to invest Pounds 450m in
its Eagle Star insurance subsidiary, bolstering the company's solvency and
increasing its ability to take advantage of the recent upturn in insurance
rates.
BAT, which reported a 56 per cent increase in its pre-tax profits for the
first nine months of 1992, is capitalising a Pounds 260m loan extended to
Eagle Star in February this year, by converting it into redeemable
preference shares.
It is also injecting an additional Pounds 190m in the form of ordinary share
capital.
The injection follows a number of capital raising exercises by UK insurance
companies this year, which have been weakened by two years of heavy losses
related to stormy weather and the recession.
Commercial Union and General Accident have raised Pounds 200m and Pounds
140m respectively through issues of cumulative irredeemable preference
shares and Royal Insurance last week raised Pounds 76m with an issue of
convertible bonds.
Mr Michael Heath, executive director at Eagle Star, said the new money would
'greatly strengthen' the company's ability to expand its premium income at a
time when premium rates were increasing.
'The timing is right, since there is a turn around in the market,' said Mr
Heath.
Overall the new money nearly doubles Eagle Star's net assets to between
Pounds 900m and Pounds 1bn. By the end of 1992 the solvency ratio of the
company's general business (which measures net assets as a percentage of
non-life premium income) should rise to more than 50 per cent, compared with
its present level of less than 30 per cent.
Analysts suggest the capital injection was necessary if Eagle Star was to
win new business. Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance analyst with Morgan Stanley,
said Eagle Star's solvency 'seemed quite weak'.
'At that level there was no way brokers would give them new business,' he
said.
Mr Heath said that with security and financial strength of insurance
companies becoming increasingly important, the issue would be well received
by the building societies and national brokers which generate much of Eagle
Star's business.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Pilkington hopes to put a shine on its prospects: Maggie
Urry analyses reasons behind a difficult morning for Roger Leverton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Roger Leverton, the new chief executive of Pilkington, the UK-based
glass group, stands up before a roomful of stockbroking analysts this
morning he will have some convincing to do.
They have become angry, even bitter, about Pilkington. Investors too have
been exasperated by the falling share price.
Mr Leverton's task is unlikely to be helped by the interim results he will
be announcing. Forecasts for pre-tax profits for the half-year to September
range up to Pounds 25m.
But many analysts admit privately their estimates are likely to be too high
and a number near zero is possible.
In the comparable period last year the group, which makes glass mainly for
the construction and automotive industries, recorded a Pounds 50.6m profit,
but even that was less than half the previous year's figure.
Annual profits, shattered by recession and weighed down by rationalisation
costs, have fallen from Pounds 325.2m in 1989 to Pounds 77m in the year to
March 31 this year, when the dividend was finally cut. A reduction in the
interim dividend is expected today.
Mr Leverton's great advantage on this occasion will be that as he only
joined the group in July he cannot be blamed for the company's record after
it escaped a bid from BTR in January 1987, since when outsiders believe they
have witnessed a series of mistakes. One says: 'Pilkington's problems are
mostly its own fault.'
Apart from Mr Leverton's arrival on the retirement of Mr Derek Cook, the
former managing director, the top management is unchanged - notably with Sir
Antony Pilkington still very much an executive chairman. So Mr Leverton will
have to be a skilled diplomat as well as a good manager if he is to turn the
company around.
Mr Leverton is not well known to the UK investing community. Of his last
three jobs only one was running a UK public company, MK Electric, which he
joined in September 1984 from Black &amp; Decker, the electrical goods maker. He
had joined Black &amp; Decker in 1968 rising to head the southern Europe
operations.
MK was taken over at the end of 1987 by RTZ after a fight which forced RTZ
to pay up. Mr Leverton stayed with the mining group, moving to Canada to run
Indal, its diversified industrial products business. It was from there that
he was headhunted back to Pilkington.
Those who remember Mr Leverton at MK are generally positive about his
talents. They recall a fondness on his part for 'business school
terminology' or, less charitably, 'bullshit'. But, as one put it, he is 'a
marketing man to his finger tips' and he 'got a cracking price for MK'.
Observers who blame Pilkington for its problems, have to admit it is working
in a difficult market worldwide - with volumes and prices falling sharply
during the recession - and the nature of glass making, a highly capital
intensive, continuous process industry, makes it expensive to cut capacity.
But they accuse the group of having preoccupations. These include an
obsession with developing new technology, at great expense and without any
apparent concern about what the customer wants. 'The sales force is
arrogant', is a typical comment.
Another follower says: 'Sixty to 70 per cent of what they produce is
bog-standard flat and safety glass where they have no lead over their
competitors.' Much higher margins could be obtained from the new types of
glass which Pilkington has successfully developed, but 'the technology has
never led to profits for shareholders', he says.
Mr Leverton's marketing skills could give the group a new direction, helping
it to tailor its research towards products which its customers want and
adding value to products rather than letting distributors gain the benefit.
Another Pilkington obsession is putting down new capacity, which because of
the time it takes to build, almost inevitably comes on stream just at the
wrong moment in the cycle. Two years ago a new float line, called UK 6, came
into production. 'Pilkington should never have built UK 6,' says an analyst.
A line in Sweden may be closed, analysts believe, at further cost.
Pilkington is also criticised for diversifying into the US contact lens
market following the failed BTR bid. Although encouraged by the City of
London at the time to attempt to break out of its cyclicality, the purchase
of Visioncare, financed through a share issue, is now perceived as a
disaster.
Any effort to sell at present would mean a large write-off which would make
a big dent in the already strained balance sheet. But the first issue
analysts want Mr Leverton to tackle is the group's finances. High levels of
capital spending, research and development costs and redundancies mean 'the
company is bleeding cash', according to one follower.
Stockbrokers are forecasting that debt, including finance leases of about
Pounds 100m, will total about Pounds 800m by the financial year-end, up from
Pounds 659m excluding the finance leases in March. Although much of the debt
has been refinanced over the last few months, the group's interest charge
will still be poorly covered by operating profits.
Pilkington has already sold many of its peripheral assets and there are few
remaining saleable, non-core businesses to go. Analysts now feel that
Pilkington may have to start cutting into its core.
Thus Mr Leverton could face a hostile audience this morning. If he fails to
make a good first impression, his task could be all the harder.

FT  10 DEC 92 / French banks seek government help over bad property loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S leading banks have appealed to the government for help over bad
debts estimated at up to FFr80bn (Pounds 9.7bn) among their property loans
of around FFr250bn.
Mr Michel Freyche, president of the Association Francaise des Banques (AFB),
said proposals put to the finance ministry at the beginning of the week were
greeted with 'an attentive and understanding ear'.
He could not give details, although it is understood that one option tabled
by the AFB is for cheap refinancing of troubled loans through the Banque de
France. Another is the creation of a state-guaranteed property fund which
would provide cheap cash to refinance dud property loans.
The move comes after a series of heavy property provisions by French banks,
which lent generously to property developers and dealers to undertake
speculative commercial property deals in central Paris during the market
upturn which went into reverse after 1990. Last week, the UAP insurance
group had to provide FFr1.4bn of capital for Banque Worms, its banking unit,
to cover losses on its Parisian property portfolio.
The banking system needs to write down between FFr70bn and FFr80bn of their
FFr250bn of total property loans to reflect the decline in values, estimated
Mr Michel Rougier, president of the Paris commercial court, in a recent
paper.
Mr Philippe Bastien, property analyst at the Paris office of James Capel,
estimates that the banks have FFr200bn of loans outstanding to professional
developers alone. Of this, he estimates that 20 per cent - FFr40bn - are so
doubtful that the banks should make provisions for them. A provision of that
size would wipe out many banks' profits if taken in a single year, given
that the entire French banking system made a net profit of only FFr11.1bn
last year on its domestic business.
Insurance companies are understood to have been exchanging property
investments between each other recently at high prices to prop up values.
A spokeswoman for AGF, the state-owned insurance group which has a FFr7bn
property portfolio, denied this, but said that insurance companies did trade
properties with each other to register profits on properties held for long
periods.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Marines move into Mogadishu: UN aid worker wounded as US
troops take control of Somali capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US MARINES in desert camouflage and black face paint stormed inland and took
the war-ravaged Somali capital Mogadishu yesterday.
By nightfall more than 1,300 Marines had been set down in the ruined capital
by Hovercraft, amphibious and helicopter landings, and had secured the
airport, port and the looted former US embassy compound. The swift
operation, which marks the start of the biggest foreign military and
humanitarian action ever taken in Africa, went off smoothly with only a few
shots fired and no casualties.
At the airport, Marines in armoured vehicles secured the control tower,
establishing a 24-hour all-weather communications operation for the first
time since civil war erupted two years ago. US Galaxy, Starlifter and
Hercules military transport aircraft streamed in, closely followed by the
first big relief flight for weeks. Shootings and extortion at the airport
had led to the cancellation of flights.
The day was marred, however, when a United Nations aid worker was shot and
wounded on the airport road by gunmen. The UN immediately announced the
suspension of relief flights.
Mogadishu harbour, where aid workers had been beset by robbing and extorting
gunmen, was also secured. Somalis, were stunned by the size and intensity of
the US operation and the constant buzz of Cobra helicopter gunships above
the devastated capital well into the night.
Thousands of the city's residents spent all day perched on sand dunes and
rooftops overlooking the port and airport. In the streets, they sang and
clapped as they surrounded Marines out on patrol and tried to start
conversations in broken English. 'We were the biggest show the folks here
have ever seen,' said Col Fred Peck, the US Marine spokesman. 'We must have
looked like Barnum and Bailey to them.'
In a remarkably honest assessment of the damage inflicted on the country by
the rival ambitions of warlords, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the self-styled
interim president who controls the north of the city, apologised to his
ruined nation in a radio broadcast. 'Each day we should remind ourselves of
the destruction we have made to our country to serve as a moral and guilty
conscience and to warn ourselves to resolve our differences in negotiations
rather than in killing ourselves.'
A contingent of 180 French foreign legionnaires also landed in Mogadishu and
said they would spend the next 10 days in the capital preparing for the
arrival of a total of 2,100 French troops.
In Kismayo, the vital southern port which has witnessed some of the worst
violence, aid workers were forced to evacuate the city after a night of clan
violence and an attack by gunmen on the Red Cross compound.
In the next phase of the operation, the Marines will head for the town of
Baidoa and secure the 10,000ft runway there to start flying in food.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Congress rejects Gaidar as premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin suffered his most serious political setback
since coming to power 18 months ago with the rejection by the Congress of
People's Deputies of Mr Yegor Gaidar as his prime minister.
Mr Gaidar narrowly missed confirmation in his post by the Congress - 467
votes to 486 against - but he is likely to remain as acting prime minister
for the immediate future.
Mr Gaidar said after the vote that the government should 'carry on working
calmly'. He, and other senior colleagues, feel it is essential to continue
reforms, especially the privatisation programme, as long as possible.
If Mr Gaidar is reappointed, even in a temporary capacity, the reforms would
continue. They would be moderated, not so much by yesterday's vote as by the
concessions already given to the opposition Civic Union and pledges made on
extra spending.
The vote came on what is expected to be the penultimate day of a Congress
which has showed both its enmity to the consequences of economic reform and
its desire to claw back powers from the presidency to itself.
However, the closeness of the vote and the lack of an alternative prime
ministerial figure from the ranks of the opposition, make it likely that Mr
Yeltsin will today propose Mr Gaidar as acting prime minister once more,
pending the adoption of a law on government which would define the powers
enjoyed by the presidency and the parliament.
Mr Mikhail Mityukov, chairman of the parliament's legislation committee,
said last night that Mr Yeltsin could appoint Mr Gaidar for a period of
three months after a new law on government had come into force.
The president's alternatives are: to propose Mr Gaidar once again, possibly
offering further compromises to attract more votes; to propose another
figure; or to take the step of dissolving a parliament which has shown
itself willing to wound him.
Political opinion last night was firmly on the side of the three-month
appointment option.
Mr Gaidar's closest aide, Mr Vladimir Mau, said: 'The vote confirms Gaidar
as a major political figure. We didn't expect anything like half. No one
else could have got as much.'
Mr Yeltsin suffered some humiliation as a result of having put forward a
compromise deal which was accepted without recompense. The Congress voted to
accept his offer that it be allowed veto rights over four ministers other
than the prime minister (defence, foreign affairs, interior and security)
before it voted against Mr Gaidar - precisely the result the deal was
supposed to prevent.
He and Mr Gaidar have also offered changes in the cabinet and in economic
policy.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's plan to sell 6m shares in Rhone-Poulenc doubtless
looked clever when it was hatched. A profits warning from the company and a
looming recession in Europe now make the timing seem less than impeccable.
By sending the shares lower once the sale was announced, the market was
hoping to pick up new stock on the cheap. All credit to the government,
then, for refusing to be hurried. With the non-voting shares back above
FFr500 this week, though, it must be tempted to take what it can get.
September's surprise profits warning did nothing to inspire confidence in
Rhone-Poulenc's forecasting ability. Weakness in the chemicals side should
hardly have come as a surprise. More worrying, though, around one-third of
recent profits growth from US pharmaceuticals has come from price increases.
That leaves Rhone-Poulenc exposed to President-elect Clinton's tough stance
on healthcare. True, less than 25 per cent of pharmaceuticals profits come
from the US. But conditions in Europe are, if anything, tougher. Even
allowing for some residual benefit from restructuring, the outlook turns on
Rhone-Poulenc's untested pipeline of new drugs and agrochemicals.
Nor are looser ties with government likely to bring much benefit. The
chairman will be elected by the board of directors rather than appointed by
decree. But with the public sector still holding a comfortable majority of
the votes after the sale, the scope for public sector interference is barely
diminished.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: NFC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC is trading on the kind of dizzy rating that leaves no margin for error.
Yesterday's full year figures planted seeds of doubt about both quality of
earnings and the solidity of the balance sheet. That was enough to send the
shares 7 per cent lower. Even so, it is too early to call the turn. True, an
unexpected Pounds 10.5m contribution from the pension fund flattered
profits. But the contribution will be a recurring item, at least until the
next revaluation of the pension fund in 1994. The sharp rise in gearing is
more worrying.
In other circumstances, NFC might be tempted to take advantage of its high
rating to raise cheap equity. With almost half the shares in the hands of
employees or pensioners, though, that is hardly a realistic option. If the
shares continue to perform, the proceeds of last month's convertible bond
issue will eventually be transformed into equity. But that cannot be taken
for granted. NFC is confined to funding expansion out of cash flow and debt.
Yesterday's figures confirm that cash flow alone is not enough.
With its logistics business backed by long-term contracts, NFC might argue
that debt funding is appropriate. The rise in gearing is partly the result
of goodwill write-offs and interest cover remains strong. Judging by
yesterday's fall in the shares, the market remembers the days of 200 per
cent gearing in the mid-1980s. One can only trust the management is equally
alive to the dangers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After Eagle Star's performance in recent years, another Pounds 450m from its
parent could look like more money going up in smoke. But BAT Industries'
decision to prop up its insurance subsidiary has offensive as well as
defensive motivation.
From one viewpoint, the very need to provide such a sum reveals the stark
extent to which Eagle Star's financial strength has been eroded by lingering
recession and the continuing mortgage indemnity crisis. In this regard,
Eagle Star is not alone; capital-raising exercises in recent weeks by the
likes of General Accident and Royal Insurance have been applied to similar
ends. Yet, in boosting the solvency ratio of its general business to more
than 50 per cent, Eagle Star is also positioning itself to compete
aggressively for new business. The marked upswing in the property and motor
insurance sectors since the spring provides the opportunity.
Happily for Eagle Star, its parent company can afford the injection simply
by diverting some of its ample cash flow from tobacco. The operation will
add a mere 3 percentage points to BAT's gearing, taking it to around 58 per
cent. Eagle Star's rivals are less lucky. They can only resort to the equity
market for the scale of funds they may still need. Like the food retailers
last year, the stronger players must be tempted to get in first and
challenge their weaker competitors to follow if they dare.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Tiny's hand unfrozen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho's deal with Mr Dieter Bock may be a good one for Mr Tiny Rowland, its
largest shareholder. That can hardly be true for other shareholders,
especially the army of small investors left behind after UK institutions
largely withdrew. Mr Rowland is shedding nearly half his stake at an
outrageous 45 per cent premium to the market. Others, who might have liked
an equal opportunity, are left to sweat it out. Where are the non-executive
directors on Lonrho's board who might have looked after their interests as
the deal was hatched?
By underwriting the rights issue at a premium, Mr Bock could end up with as
much as 19 per cent of Lonrho. The decent thing would be to make an offer
for the rest at the 115p which Mr Rowland is receiving. More likely, his
arrival signals an accelerated breakup of the company, especially after last
night's disposal of VAG. Some of the remaining assets are attractive.
Doubtless Genting would like the hotels and Gencor the South African mining
interests.
With net assets per share of 157p, breakup ought to enhance shareholder
value. But that begs a lot of questions. Net asset value has fallen by
around a quarter over the past year. Some of the cash in the group balance
sheet is effectively locked up in Metropole hotels. Moreover, it is hard to
see how any surplus proceeds could be transferred to shareholders. Lonrho
already has an ACT problem: a higher dividend or even a share buy-back
programme would make that worse. To hold on requires an enormous act of
faith when Mr Bock's own origins are so obscure. More unnerving still, is
that Mr Rowland, who knows all Lonrho's secrets, seems finally to be
thinking of calling it a day.

Incoming Philips finance director Dudley Eustace told the Reuters newswire

After its clumsy handling of its profits-warning in June, Philips needs to
improve relations with the investment community. But Eustace did not exactly
prove a dab hand in that respect while at British Aerospace's financial
controls. The market was certainly ill-prepared for the appalling background
to BAe's rights issue flop last year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the best paid City slicker would not sniff at a Pounds 25,000 Christmas
bonus. But Jackie Haq, a 36-year-old mother of five living on income
support, is putting the better-heeled to shame.
On being handed the Pounds 25,000 Jameson Urban Poverty Award yesterday, she
announced she's giving the money away.
Her home is on Newcastle upon Tyne's grim Scotswood estate where only 18 per
cent of people are in work and over half the unemployed have been jobless
for at least two years. She was picked for 'courage combined with charisma
and vision' in combating problems of deprivation, despair and loan sharks.
Her prize will be used to set up a trust fund to help Scotswood become a
'nice friendly place again'. As it is, she says, her decision to give away
the cash is being treated with such incredulity that 'my fear is some people
will try to break in because they won't believe it'.
With all credit to her, however, it's a sobering thought that had she been
better off, the incentive to keep the money would have been greater. Since
she's on social security benefits, the winnings would cause problems.

So what duties will UK Customs &amp; Excise chairman Sir Brian Unwin be
collecting as the barriers come down with the single market?
The answer is apparently the plum job at the European Investment Bank, for
which Observer has long tipped
him. The puzzle is why the appointment has been so
long delayed.
Despite speculation that other EC community states were sceptical about his
credentials, the reason turns out to be nothing directly to do with Unwin.
The pussy-
footing was over who will succeed him at the end of his term six years
hence.
Certain smaller states, fed up with their sparse plum ration, wanted
assurance that his successor will be one of their citizens.

For a man who has just signed up Alan Sugar, the establishment's

Although St Johnston's Pro-Ned outfit despises the old boy network which

has helped troubled companies like Wace and Brent Walker find new non-execs,

The race is on among top US executives to beat the higher personal income
taxes promised by President-elect Bill Clinton. And who do you suppose
figures high among the Wall Street whizz-bangs who stand to benefit from
their employers' willingness to let them cash in early?
None other than Robert Rubin, the Goldman Sachs co-chairman who is a top
Clinton aide and expected to be named - possibly today - as the new White
House economic security adviser.
Goldman Sachs has joined others on the Street such as Morgan Stanley, JP
Morgan and Salomon Brothers, in swiftly confirming their response to the
prospect of tax hikes. They have given their executives the option of taking
1992 bonuses before year-end, instead of the normal payout early in the new
year.
The rush to forestall the Internal Revenue Service began a week ago with
Michael Eisner, chairman of The Walt Disney Company, deciding to exercise
stock options now that could yield nearly Dollars 200m.
As well as executives and bankers, though, the queue to cash in includes
lawyers, actors and even sports figures. An example is pitcher David Cone of
the Kansas City Royals baseball team who, as part of a new Dollars 15m
three-year deal, has been given Dollars 9m up-front.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Eastward, look, the land is bright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the fascination of the gloomy media and financial commentators with
the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the undoubted presence of many
warning signs, there is still no evidence to date that the industrial world
faces a slump on anything like that scale.
As the new London Business School Economic Outlook usefully reminds us,
combined output in the seven leading industrial economies rose by  1/2 per
cent in 1991 and a probable 1 per cent in 1992. This is certainly a slowdown
compared with an established trend growth rate of 2 or 3 per cent per annum
and creates obvious problems of rising joblessness.
But nothing that has so far happened is anything like the Great Depression,
when US output fell by a third and world trade diminished by more than
two-thirds in value terms. Despite all the new elements of financial unease,
the growth slowdown so far is of the same order as that of the early 1980s.
Even in the UK the estimated output drop of 3 to 4 per cent on both
occasions is less than half of what was seen in 1929-33.
The slowdown in the west, together with the genuinely depressed state of the
'former centrally planned economies' - a euphemism for the ex-Soviet Union
and its satellites - has been enough to put competitive markets under a
cloud, to provoke some sneaking sympathy in the west for Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's opponents in the military industrial complex, to bring back
into fashion itchy government interventionism, and to make the foreign
offices of the west afraid to say 'boo' to any unpleasant autocracy which
has done them the favour of placing arms orders.
Someone who is suspicious of this mood music and wants to cheer up in the
face of the Edinburgh summit should look, not backwards to the Great
Depression, but across to the other side of the world to the prospering
developing countries of eastern Asia, which have contracted out of the world
slowdown.
These do not, incidentally, now include Japan, which has acquired most of
the characteristics of the other Group of Seven industrial countries.
Japanese growth in 1992 is estimated to be around 1 1/2 to 2 per cent and
some leading Japanese economists expect a virtual standstill in 1993-94.
By contrast, the four Asian 'tigers' - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore - are all estimated to be growing by between 6 and 7 1/2 per cent
this year. Even the non-tiger countries are achieving a comparable
performance - China 5 1/2 per cent, Indonesia 6 1/2 per cent, Malaysia 7 1/2
per cent and Thailand 8 per cent. Only the Philippines has slowed to G7
growth rates.
The ability of Asian developing countries to contract out of the western
slowdown is not confined to the accidents of particular countries or years.
Nor does it just reflect the ability to make use of a rising population. GDP
per capita in all the Asian developing countries taken together has been
rising at least twice as rapidly as in the G7, both in the boom of the 1980s
and in the subsequent slowdown.
The mixed group of Middle Eastern and European (mostly southern European)
developing countries now also shows signs of outperforming the industrial
leaders. But, despite the improvement in some of the formerly heavily
indebted Latin American states, the region as a whole is still crawling;
southern Africa is, alas, still in absolute decline.
Asia's leading countries cover a great many different political and economic
systems. What they do seem to have in common is a willingness to use market
incentives (even in China), a well-established system of property rights
(unlike the former Soviet Union), a respect for technical training, a very
obvious work ethic and an increasing openness to trade.
The achievement of the Asian developing countries attracts public attention
when vulnerable American or European industries cry out for quotas or
anti-dumping duties. But they still do not figure sufficiently in the
general assessment of the world economy. This reflects the fact that the
countries labelled 'industrial' by the IMF still account for well over 70
per cent of world GDP. Asia's developing countries together account for only
just over 7 per cent.
But compound interest has its own logic. To make a stylised projection: let
us put together the Asian developing countries with those of the Middle East
and southern Europe. Let us say that they account for 10 per cent of world
GDP - a slight underestimate. Let us assume that all these countries
together can achieve a growth rate averaging 6 per cent per annum (in total,
not per capita). If the established industrial countries achieve only 2 per
cent, they will be overtaken by 'Asia' just after the year 2040, within the
lifetime of the majority of people now living. Even if western growth rates
buck up to 3 per cent or Asian growth rates are slightly lower, the catch-up
will come around 2060, still within within some people's lifetimes.
These divergences are discussed from an industrial point of view by Lord
Rees-Mogg in a thoughtful article in The Independent, published on Monday.
He presents the rise of the Asian economies as a threat to European
prosperity unless we all wake up and adopt more of the cultural
characteristics I listed in a previous paragraph. We should indeed accept
some of them selectively, but not out of fear. The growth of other areas of
prosperity is an opportunity more than a threat. It is extremely unlikely
that Asian citizens will forever want to pile up their export proceeds in
the form of yen, dollar or even Ecu notes on their walls - although if they
did it would be a pure gift to the G7.
Rees-Mogg talks of industrial costs 2 per cent of those in Europe. They can
only be low in some specific sectors because the general level of
productivity in their whole economies is still well beneath that of the
west. As general prosperity and productivity increase, so will real wages.
Lord Macaulay made a famous attack on those who advocated child labour to
counter the supposed competitive threats of that era. Other countries'
growth is beneficial, and trade should be and can be a form of rivalry
between companies rather than warfare between countries.
But my main point is that we need both to stop patting the Asian countries
on their heads as examples of successful development and to stop running
scared of their achievements, but instead to begin to take them into that
management, albeit minimal, of the world economy which even an international
market system requires.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Letter: Not a burdensome inclusion in All-Share Index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Martyn Arbib perhaps overstates his case (Letters, December 7) in
criticising the inclusion of specialist investment trusts in the expansion
of the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index from January 1 1993.
The investment trusts that he named, all specialists in overseas markets,
have a total market value of less than Pounds 250m - well below a tenth of 1
per cent of the value of the All-Share Index. If these shares doubled while
the remaining shares of the All-Share remained in aggregate unchanged, the
effect would be an outperformance of the same amount, that is, less than a
tenth of 1 per cent. Hardly burdensome]
Pursuing Mr Arbib's argument to its ultimate conclusion would, of course,
exclude huge swathes of constituents of the All-Share Index. Would he also
exclude BAT, Guinness, Reuters, BP - because of their heavy overseas
businesses - to name but a handful?
The All-Share Index has been expanded to meet a perceived need of a broad
cross-section of fund managers and investors. The addition of some 150
stocks will expand the market value of the index by some 1 per cent. Its
re-design can never satisfy all - but will, I trust, meet the needs of most.

Unfortunately, some people only read the headlines and may think I am

SEC that I have no intention of again being a chief executive officer of a
securities firm and undertook not to do so without applying.
After all these months under a cloud, I welcome the SEC's judgment that I
was not involved in any way in the misconduct. Because I was Salomon's CEO
at the time, I was willing to accept the consequences of any mistakes.
I am satisfied that the record now is clear that Salomon Brothers is and was

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was dismayed to read ('Burning the house Jacques built', December 8)
that the UK government proposes to sacrifice 21 EC consumer protection
measures, and various draft directives, on 'the altar of subsidiarity'.
Subsidiarity should mean that policy decisions are taken at the most
appropriate level - whether European, national, regional or local. Unfair
trading practices and dangerous goods do not stop at national borders.
Without Community legislation, unscrupulous traders may take advantage of
inconsistencies between national laws, and discredit the single market to
the detriment of consumers and reputable suppliers. We believe common EC
rules governing safety, consumer contracts, advertising, labelling and
consumer redress are essential if consumers are to take the opportunities
offered by a wider single market.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Letter: Wider relevance of coup defeat in Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr B S MCBETH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I could not agree more fully with your leader ('Perilous moment',
December 7) on Venezuela and Peru. The defeat last week of the second
attempted military coup in Venezuela in less than 12 months should be looked
at as a sign of strengthening the democratic basis of government in the
country, and the administration of President Carlos Andre Perez should be
congratulated on insisting that elections for state governorships and over
5,000 other posts at local level be held as scheduled on December 6. This is
of particular significance to the rest of Latin America where the spectre of
authoritarianism may be raising its ugly head once again.
The opposition party, Copei, as expected won the majority of the state
governorships, but the important point is that the country has probably
entered into a new level of political maturity under which change is
undertaken through the ballot box and not by the men in uniform. The current
government of Venezuela faces serious political and economic problems in the
coming months which will lead to further political uncertainty, as any other
government has to tackle during its period in office. However, it should be
obvious that a military solution is not one of the answers.
It is encouraging that in other parts of the region a similar type of
experience is happening with the impeachment process of President Collor
under way in Brazil and elections being forced on President Fujimori in Peru
to reinstate Congress. The region faces grave problems and difficult
political and economic decisions ahead, but it should be clear to the
military from recent events that the toppling of a democratically elected
government only serves to complicate matters and obstruct development.

Sir, Observer should take comfort ('Basket cases', December 8) that there

Present street kiosk prices for the Snicker chocolate bar are inflating by
20 per cent a week. Travellers to Russia might bear this in mind when

FT  10 DEC 92 / Return to sender, cost unknown: The fate of Britain's Post
Office represents a test of the government's commitment to privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Post Office is the quintessential old-style public service. The
village post office is a centre for news and gossip; the postman and pillar
box are a traditional part of the landscape; the stamps have the Queen's
head on them. This monolithic edifice is already under threat from the
government's plans to sell Parcelforce, the parcels delivery service. In the
next few weeks the government must decide whether to go a big step further:
to sell off the Royal Mail and the post offices as well.
Perhaps the surprising thing is that this did not happen long ago. The Post
Office has been in profit for each of the past 16 years. It has no debt,
needs no subsidy and has contributed Pounds 750m to the public coffers over
the past decade. At a time when a cash-strapped government is reduced to
seeking buyers for commercial no-hopers such as British Rail and British
Coal, why is the Post Office still in the public sector at all?
The answer is deeply political. The Post Office may rouse mixed feelings in
the average voter, but by general consent it does an essential job pretty
well. Tinkering with it might seem a useless application of ideology,
besides jeopardising the universal nature of its service. Even the
arch-privatiser Mrs Margaret Thatcher declared the Royal Mail sacrosanct
when last running for election. And as the Post Office's managing director,
Mr Bill Cockburn, pointedly remarks, in every marginal constituency there is
a marginal post office.
But as Mr Cockburn also makes clear, there are distinct problems with the
status quo. However old-fashioned the Post Office's image, it forms part of
the fast-moving and highly competitive communications industry. To hold its
own in a world of electronic data, it must invest, modernise and perhaps
even expand overseas. But as long as it remains in the public sector, any
money it borrows counts as part of the UK budget deficit, or public sector
borrowing requirement. At a time when the deficit is growing rapidly this is
hardly a recipe for expansion.
Not that Mr Cockburn is unaware of the political pressures. 'Of all the
things we do,' he says, 'the post office network is politically the most
sensitive. The key point is that we're the great cash dispensers. The Post
Office hands out Pounds 100bn a year in cash to 28m people, in pensions,
child benefit and so on. Most people leave the post office with more money
than they came in with. That makes it a magnet to draw people in, and the
spending power it generates is quite important.'
The snag is that of the UK's 20,000 post offices, half do not cover their
costs and have to be subsidised from the Post Office's other activities. 'If
they were subjected to pure market forces,' Mr Cockburn says, 'you could see
a substantial reduction in their number. That would be very, very
controversial politically.'
Privatising the network would also raise awkward commercial questions. It is
not quite clear, for instance, whether the crucial contracts which allow the
post offices to handle pensions, benefits and the like could be redrawn in
sufficiently waterproof fashion to satisfy a commercial buyer.
But there is an argument in favour of privatisation as well. The Post Office
is a formidable force in the high street, with more outlets than the banks
and the building societies put together. By law, it can only perform
transactions for the public sector and the utilities. If it were permitted
to undertake banking transactions, for example, it might be in a better
position to fulfil its obligation to maintain a national network.
But however tricky the post offices may be politically, they are small beer
in commercial terms. Last year, they accounted for only a fifth of the Post
Office's Pounds 5bn turnover and a 10th of its profit. From the government's
point of view, the real big fish is the Royal Mail itself, which handles the
delivery of mail excluding parcels. This accounts for three-quarters of the
Post Office's turnover and made a pre-tax profit last year of Pounds 266m.
On its own, Royal Mail might fetch about Pounds 1.5bn on flotation.
As to how desirable this would be, Mr Cockburn remains studiously neutral.
The main thing, he says, is that the organisation should be free to expand
and modernise, not whether it is in the private or the public sector. But
then, if the Treasury were capable of flexibility in funding public
enterprises, much of the privatisation programme need never have taken
place. And indeed, given that privatisation would doubtless mean a handsome
increase in Mr Cockburn's Pounds 140,000 salary, his detachment may be taken
with a pinch of salt.
The business argument, however, has a certain logic. 'The real competition
for the Royal Mail,' Mr Cockburn says, 'is faxes, press and TV advertising,
automatic banking transactions and so on. Ninety per cent of mail is
business mail, and clearly the business buyer has a range of choices. If you
take the communications market as a whole, we reckon the post has a 15 per
cent market share. So it's not by any means the dominant player. The real
competition is telecommunications and its related products, especially as
their real cost comes down over time.'
In the course of the 1980s, the volume of mail in the UK went up by 50 per
cent. But that represented merely a holding of market share, after a period
of decline in the 1970s. To maintain that position, Mr Cockburn argues, what
he needs above all is access to capital.
'We believe there's real potential to grow the business. But that involves
the ability to do acquisitions and joint ventures, and to steer our business
into other areas as the market develops. For example, we could add an
electronic component to traditional postal transactions. Instead of giving
us a lot of letters to deal with, a lot of people might prefer to give us
computer tapes. We could then take the information from the tapes and
deliver it to customers, either in hard copy or electronic format, or a
combination of the two.
'That's the way the communications market is going to develop, and what
we've got to avoid is getting locked into the old way of doing things and
progressively losing out to technology. If we become old-fashioned, large
companies will start to design us out of their process. We have to interface
with our customers in the way they want, which might mean us having direct
access to their computer systems or whatever.'
But it is at this point that the private individual starts to feel uneasy.
For the Royal Mail to transform itself in the service of big business is one
thing. But if the price is privatisation, the average voter might feel
threatened on two fronts. Not only would the traditional face of the Post
Office change. It would also drift away from public accountability into the
hands of a shadowy regulator, an Ofpost. Like the other privatised utility
regulators, Ofpost would doubtless concentrate on questions of competition
while denying responsibility for public policy.
As to the first point, says Mr Cockburn, the business and residential
community are in partnership. Individuals use the mail mostly to communicate
not with each other, but with business. 'Social mail - voter to voter, if
you like - only makes up 10 per cent of the total. A lot of the rest is
business transactions by the residential community, whether electricity
bills or phone bills. We're the pipeline in the middle, facilitating the
transactions between the two.'
The other benefit to the individual, he argues, is cost. Over the past
decade, as volume has risen, the real price of sending a letter has fallen
by 13 per cent. 'The Royal Mail is a business with very large fixed costs,
and it clearly benefits greatly from growth, as we've seen in the past. So
growth is an important business objective, and the benefits from it come
back to both the residential customer and the business customer in terms of
the real price we charge for the transaction.'
But what about issues of public policy? The recent furore over pit closures
and the lack of a national energy policy has reminded the British public
that privatisation has its drawbacks as well as its strengths. Where is the
guarantee that a privatised Post Office will continue to act in the public
interest?
The chief guarantee, says Mr Cockburn, comes in the promises made by Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, when announcing the
review now taking place. 'Mr Heseltine described certain things as
non-negotiable. There will be a universal delivery service for both parcels
and letters, from Monday to Saturday. There will be a universal tariff
structure, so that a letter costs the same wherever in the country it is
posted. And there will be a national network of post offices.
'These are the key political considerations - the hot buttons of
controversy. If you can provide rock-solid assurance that these obligations
will be protected and enforced, I think that would go a long way to
reassuring people. The important thing is that wherever you live in the
country you're not cut off from the network just because of economic
arguments. So long as that's protected, I think it's all upside.'
If the government were to decide to privatise the Royal Mail, it would have
to deal with some thorny technical questions. In particular, it would have
to decide whether to retain the Royal Mail's monopoly on mail below a
certain price - at present Pounds 1 - in return for the obligation to
deliver letters to every household in the country. It would also have to
decide what the new limit should be.
But for the student of privatisation, the really interesting question is
whether the government will bring itself to risk the step in the first
place. The commercial case for privatising the Post Office is at least as
persuasive as for some other utilities. But there remains a residual unease
in the British population about the idea of basic services being handed over
to big business. The government's decision will be as good a sign as any of
whether the UK's privatisation movement still has any life in it.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Personal View: To Russia with resolve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ODLING-SMEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has been actively involved in helping Russia
and other states of the former Soviet Union (FSU) find solutions to their
pressing economic and financial problems. This is one of the greatest
challenges in the IMF's 48-year history.
The transformation from a centrally planned to a market economy is a
profoundly difficult task for two reasons. First, restructuring or replacing
existing industry will take time and financial resources, which are
particularly scarce. Second, there is a need to build the institutions
necessary for a market economy to function efficiently. Basic institutions,
such as a modern financial sector and a functioning system of commercial
law, did not exist. Therefore, economic and institutional transformation has
to be comprehensive, rather than piecemeal.
Not surprisingly, the early results have been mixed. There are some
encouraging signs. Market behaviour by producers is becoming more
widespread. The government's privatisation programme is gaining momentum.
New private businesses are being created all the time.
However, serious strains have also emerged. With the collapse of the old
system of central planning and the disruption of trade flows within the FSU,
output has declined sharply. Considerable parts of the existing industrial
plant cannot survive without assistance, and domestic political pressures to
maintain output and employment are strong. The result has been excessive
budget subsidies and credit expansion to finance loss-making enterprises.
There is now a real danger that inflation will escalate into hyperinflation
unless the Russian authorities act vigorously to reimpose financial
discipline. And hyperinflation would threaten to wipe out all the gains made
so far, and jeopardise the reform process itself.
These developments point to the only practical way out of the present
economic crisis:
stabilise the macroeconomic situation;
press ahead with the whole array of structural reform measures, including
corporatisation and privatisation, enterprise restructuring and financial
sector reform, market-oriented legal, institutional and accounting reforms,
and improved enterprise management. At the same time, resist the temptation
to reintroduce non-market methods such as price controls and large
subsidies;
ensure that the social safety net is adequate so that the human cost of
higher unemployment, which will be inevitable, is tolerable, but not so
expensive as to undermine budgetary stability.
The IMF is actively working with the Russian authorities to make progress in
all these areas. First, it approved Dollars 1bn in credits in August. As a
second step, it is currently negotiating an economic reform and
macroeconomic stabilisation programme that may be supported by more
financial assistance. Unfortunately, this is taking longer than expected,
because of the authorities' inability so far to decide on firm monetary and
fiscal policies. The third phase, which may involve a Dollars 6bn fund to
stabilise the rouble, will begin when conditions are more favourable.
IMF technical experts are also active in advising on macroeconomic policies,
structural reforms and the social safety net. At present as much as a third
of the IMF's worldwide technical assistance effort is being devoted to
Russia and other FSU countries. The IMF is also making an extraordinary
commitment of human resources. The unprecedented concentration of effort is
clear evidence of the priority that the IMF is giving to these countries.
The IMF is not alone, by any means. The response of the community of nations
to Russia's appeal for help has been very positive. Last April, the US and
Germany announced a Dollars 24bn package of external financial assistance
for Russia for 1992. Excluding the Dollars 6bn for a stabilisation fund
(which will become available only in the third stage of IMF assistance), it
is now expected that the total amount of assistance, including grants,
export credits, humanitarian aid and debt relief, will approach Dollars
18bn.
In terms of technical assistance, many international institutions and
governments have been providing experts. In addition, many private
companies, consultancies and non-profit-making bodies have been making
available their skills and know-how.
It could be argued that donors and creditors should have been even more
generous. But it certainly cannot be claimed, as some observers have done,
that the response in 1992 has fallen short of promises.
At the IMF, we harbour no illusions about the scale of the problem, the
possible setbacks and the time needed to complete the task. We understand
the temptation to slow down the pace of reform. But we believe that this
would only create worse problems in the future. It is better to take the
difficult decisions at the beginning of the process, to set the economy on
the right path from the outset. The author is director of the IMF's European
II department

FT  10 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Russian reform under attack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YEGOR Gaidar, the 'courageous, determined and just plain clever' (as Mr
Boris Yeltsin, his president called him) acting prime minister of Russia,
yesterday failed to receive the necessary support of the Congress of
People's Deputies to be confirmed as prime minister. He may remain as acting
prime minister under presidential protection, but his equivocal status is
the last thing a man in his tight corner needs.
The Congress of People's Deputies has not materially affected the reality
which the majority of the deputies profess to hate. In part, the populist
rage expressed was proper, even healthy: as people's tribunes, they should
be reflecting the hardship being suffered by many of their constituents -
and there are clear signs that considerations of this kind, absent under the
old system, are now registering strongly. In part, however, it was damaging,
taking the form of grasping for a control it could never exercise and for
the right to decide issues it could never judge.
Mr Gaidar and his team come out of that forum with the world as it was when
they went in. Monthly inflation is still reckoned to be running at around 25
per cent; the fall in production over the year is around 20 per cent, as is
the fall in exports. The central bank answers to a populist parliament. Even
if it did not, it is not clear that any central bank would be able to deny
credit to enterprises which would otherwise lay off masses of workers.
If the world is no better, Mr Gaidar is in far worse shape. He has agreed,
or is party to Mr Yeltsin's agreement, to indexation of the value of
individual savings, to a very slow rise in the price of oil, to a rise in
real living standards, to an end to production falls and to support and
protection for industry. But he is also committed to bringing down
inflation.
Constitutional crisis
The circle cannot be squared. The Russian government cannot stop the halt in
production and increase employment, while lowering the rate of inflation,
reducing the budget deficit and stabilising the currency at the same time.
Two conclusions can be drawn from this Congress. First, Russia is in a
constitutional crisis. The current mess puts a high premium on political
manoeuvring, cripples effective government and could rapidly lead to a
polarisation of attitudes and even a declaration of presidential rule, after
which democratic institutions would be hard to reconstruct. Constitutional
change has become mandatory
Second, the Civic Union alliance, with which the government tried to make a
deal, is a loose coalition, at least part of which is interested in reform.
It seems to possess a reformist wing that is beginning to understand the
constraints under which the government works and is willing to offer
qualified aid. What this might amount to in practice is unclear.
Foreign support
In order to get the necessary political space for a constitutional
settlement, introduction of the market economy and macroeconomic
stabilisation, the government needs the support from abroad that has been
lacking so far. The targets set by the International Monetary Fund as a
condition for a standby agreement are meaningless in today's conditions.
Furthermore, any IMF-guided stabilisation programme has little chance of
working in the short term. The west must face up to the urgency and
proximity of the Russian collapse.
In the absence of other leadership, this will be an early dilemma for Mr
Bill Clinton. Mr Clinton was right to argue, as he did during the electoral
campaign, that the cold war was 'won' above all by the way people of eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union rejected the communist system. He needs
to build on that truth with a plan to organise assistance of a scale and
kind that is relevant to Russia's problems and recognises its importance.
The present Congress has refused to confirm Russia's bold reformer. In so
doing, it has aggravated the crisis without proposing any solution. Mr
Gaidar seemed, last night, likely to limp on until spring in a temporary
capacity. If the west is serious about the support it has always trumpeted
for him, it must come forward now with some determination and courage - and
plain cleverness - of its own.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Private lives, public heirs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S announcement that the Prince and Princess of Wales are to live
separately raises more questions about the future of the British monarchy
than it answers. In essence, it says that since nothing will change except
the living arrangements of the heir to the throne and his wife the couple
should now be left in peace. This is not convincing. Everything will change,
and the prince and princess will continue, however regrettably, to be the
focus of attention.
The statement, issued by Buckingham Palace and read in the House of Commons
by the prime minister, might prove conclusive in a country in which there
was no established church, no popular demand for a family to represent the
crown, no insatiable public thirst for information about all aspects of
royal life and no antiquated structure of law and tradition. Britain is not
such a country. The monarch is head of the Church of England, the Queen is
revered as head of a family, the media reflect public tastes and the essence
of royalty is tradition.
When the time comes for Prince Charles to ascend the throne his putative
subjects may find it difficult to understand how a man who lives separately
from his wife can become head of the church that bears his country's name.
The Archbishop of Canterbury was quoted in aid by the palace yesterday, but
that does not necessarily end the matter.
Like the monarchy, the established church depends for its existence upon the
support of its adherents. Because it is established, there is a sense in
which the two institutions sink or swim together. There is a balance to be
struck between maintaining strict rules of personal conduct and accepting
that social morality has changed. It is not clear that either palace - the
archbishop's or the Queen's - has yet got it right.
Family life
During most of the present century the British people have demanded of their
sovereigns that they symbolise traditional family life. It was because he
could not do so that the Queen's uncle was obliged to abdicate in 1937. The
Duke of Windsor's sin was that he proposed to marry a divorced woman. At
that time such a move was unacceptable to both church and state. It might
not be so today. Yet the highly publicised marital difficulties of the
present Queen's children have unfortunately damaged what Bagehot referred to
as the 'dignified' part of the constitution.
The proposition put forward yesterday that somehow this separated couple can
become King and Queen as if nothing untoward had happened does little to
repair that damage. It is difficult to imagine life under what would be two
thrones, sitting back to back, facing opposite directions.
Sensational stories
The strength of royalty is a matter of perception; if people do not believe
that what they think they see is worthy of respect the monarchy is devalued.
The increasingly intrusive tabloid press, followed closely by television and
some of the broadsheets, has not served the royal family well. An industry
has been created around a single product: sensational stories about royal
persons.
This is a sad comment on an unsavoury aspect of contemporary life. Yet no
industry can exist without customers. If people did not want to read such
stuff, and pay to do so, it would not be produced. The market for palace
scandals is a keen one. Against such harsh reality, the call in parliament
yesterday for a moratorium on stories about the prince and princess sounds
forlorn.
It is therefore possible that the British constitution, which exists in the
mind rather than on paper, will suffer from further destabilisation when the
Queen's reign comes to an end. She has conducted herself with great dignity
and composure over the past 40 years, and would serve her country well if
she could continue for many more decades.
But, in spite of Mr John Major's plea for silent acceptance of yesterday's
news, it cannot now be said that the succession is predictable. For a
constitutional monarchy, it is not a disaster that there should be debate
about the implications of the announcement and the changes in social context
and expectations which form its background. At all events, such a debate is
now inescapable.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Arts: London City Ballet's 'Romeo and Juliet' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London City Ballet has taken up residence at Sadler's Wells for what seems
by now a regular engagement at the year's end. The repertory comprises Romeo
and Juliet in Ben Stevenson's staging and a couple of attractive triple
bills, with an admixture of guest artists to tickle the box-office palate.
I have a great deal of time for LCB because of its dogged determination to
succeed, its no less dogged determination that audiences shall enjoy
themselves, and its resilience in the face of official indifference - this
somewhat improved since last year by an Arts Council grant for touring.
Private sector subvention is still essential to the company, and LCB has an
excellent record of
finding corporations who respond to the company's ideals - this year's
activities have benefited from Barclay's generosity.
If some of the troupe's large-scale stagings have been ill-advised - La
Traviata a few years ago was a brute - the present Romeo, like last season's
Swan Lake, is decent. Stevenson's version was
made for his Houston Ballet, and it is cleverly adapted to
LCB's more modest forces. It is a production able if not especially
imaginative, and its dance is bland, but
LCB's artists give of their
best and bring theatrical vitality to every moment. (There are a couple of
characters who look lightly stunned, but how good to see a Friar Laurence -
Michael Hogan - who cares deeply for the lovers).
David Walker's design is stylish, and gives an unaccustomed depth for the
Wells' stage. The reduction of the Prokofiev score to suit the numbers of
LCB's orchestra has been sensitively done by Chris Nicholls. It is, all in
all, a fine achievement for the company, and in Kim Miller, the Juliet of
Tuesday's opening, it has a clear, potent central interpretation.
Miss Miller dances, and speaks to us with feeling. Her natural style is
beautifully rounded and fluent - there are hints of Lynn Seymour (who will
appear as Lady Capulet in this season) in the way movement melts and flows
onward. She carries conviction in everything: in the way movement is stated,
with especially lovely arms; in the way the dramatic climate of a scene is
established.
I think she pushes a couple of moments rather hard - she might tone down the
choreography's girlish capers with the nurse - but she enhances Stevenson's
ideas by the distinction of her talent.
Her Romeo was Paul Thrussell, attentive, loving, responsive, his reading
touching in its innocence. And from Viktor Barykin a tremendous Tybalt.
Barykin, on whose admirable interpretations with the Bolshoy I have reported
in the past, gives a brave account of a saturnine, provocative bully.
He cuts through the action like his own sword and is fine indeed. This LCB
season is very welcome.

triple bills until January 2. Sponsorship by Barclays; Texaco

FT  10 DEC 92 / Arts: Thom Gunn wins the Forward Prize - Poetry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week the largest prize for poetry ever to be awarded in the UK - Pounds
10,000 - was given to Thom Gunn for his poem 'Lament', one of a sequence of
elegies to friends who died of AIDS that conclude his fine new book, The Man
with Night Sweats (Faber, Pounds 5.99 and Pounds 11.99). The Prize was
awarded for an individual poem, but the judges also decided to honour the
book as a whole, in the manner of the the Booker and the Whitbread awards
(in the past, poetry prizes have been awarded to single poems published
ephemerally in a newspaper or a magazine).
The Forward Prize is the idea of William Sieghart of Forward Publishing, and
it was directly modelled on the annual Guinness anthologies of poetry that
were published in the 1950s. At the prizegiving Sieghart said that his aim
was to 'bring poetry out of poetry corner'.
To give the prize to Thom Gunn was an excellent decision for two reasons.
In the first place, The Man with Night Sweats is the best collection of
poetry to have been published in the last 12 months. Second, Gunn is
acknowledged as a poet of unusual power in a career that has spanned almost
four decades - ever since those heady post-Cambridge days of the early
1950s, when he and EJ ('Ted') Hughes seemed to be the finest poets writing
in England - means that the award is likely to attract the maximum amount of
publicity.
Gunn's subject in The Man with Night Sweats, AIDS, is one of the great
tragic themes of our time. His control and precision are reminiscent of the
masters of the 18th century. The subject has profoundly shocked him, living
as he does at the heart of San Francisco's gay community.
The judges' selection of the best poems of the year have been collected in
the new Forward Book of Poetry (Pounds 5.95, Forward Publishing), copies of
which will be distributed free to every school in the UK thanks to the
sponsorship of the Midland Bank.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Arts: Looking back - 'A Penny for a Song'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main English notions about England is that it is brimful of
darling, impractical eccentrics; that the most shattering events of history
have occurred abroad; that England is a safe and charming refuge from the
real world; and that things have been so for centuries - and should continue
so.
So it is in John Whiting's 1951 comedy A Penny for a Song, set in 1804,
during the Napoleonic Wars, and currently revived (in its 1962 revised text)
at the Orange Tree, Richmond. Sir Timothy plans to repulse the invading
French army by impersonating Napoleon and - using French from a textbook -
ordering it to go back home. His sister-in-law Hester prepares to join the
East Anglian Amazon corps. Meanwhile their cricketing neighbour 'Stumper'
Selincourt trains a very amateur home guard. And so on. Everything is very,
very charming.
There are still those who love this kind of pretty treacle; but I am too
conscious of its deliberate unreality to relax to its comedy. A Penny for a
Song wants to evoke the Shallow and Silence scenes in Henry IV Part Two, and
the Dogberry episodes of Much Ado; and it reminds us now of the dafter
flights of Dad's Army. I love an English comic idyll too. Whiting's play,
however, more anodyne and escapist than all these, tries to hug England for
its sillier Englishnesses and to be wistful about it as well.
The giveaway comes in the quaintly stylised language. ('I'll not believe
that this day, this so-called Armageddon, can pass without our being
needed.') Nothing like 1804 parlance, nor much like 1951, this talk apes
Oscar Wilde. Especially the play's do-nothing spectator, Hallam Matthews: 'I
have published three polemical pamphlets on quite uncontroversial subjects.'
But Wilde's delicious sting is here replaced by mere charm. Whiting had not
the force to tease England. He merely wanted to love it, with a laugh and
also a little sigh.
And he came to sense his play's inclination to excessive idyllic escapism.
His 1962 re-write beefs up the role of Edward, the one character in the play
who talks of the value of revolution, the horrors of war and the importance
of social change. I am grateful for every window on the real world that this
character opens. But even Edward has buckets of charm. By the end of the
play, it matters more to us that he and Hester's daughter Dorcas may end up
in true love than that he may pursue his politics.
Every other character in the play is conceived not to be convincingly
lifelike but to be theatrically adorable. Sam Walters's direction emphasises
this. As Hallam Matthews, Michael Elwyn speaks in carefully fluted tones
that chiefly evoke Alan Bennett as a C. of E. vicar. Like David Timson's Sir
Timothy and Auriol Smith's Hester, he projects his own consciousness that he
is playing an English eccentric. And thereby underlines the unreality,
pointlessness and harmlessness of the whole play.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Arts: 'Weldon Rising' bares the breast - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Replete with bare-breasted lesbian sex, three versions of the same fatal
stabbing, a gay male couple, a transvestite male prostitute and a homocidal
homophobe, here is the best new play I have seen in many months. Its
excellence is not to do with its more sensational features, though they are
necessary to it. This play is exciting because it is well written, unusually
constructed, and (Leavis voice) morally serious. It is also (Macaulay voice)
frequently funny. What makes it serious is that it is all about fear and
responsibility.
Jimmy, who has lived with Natty Weldon for 15 years, is stabbed to death by
a nameless boy in the meat-packing district of New York during a heatwave.
(The temperature is 120 and rising.) Natty is so scared that he runs away
before Jimmy has even died. Three other people, however, observe the whole
murder. They are Marcel, the transvestite, and the two dikes Jaye and Tilly.
This draws them and Natty gradually into a web of quasi-complicity, because
life changes for them all after the murder.
They all have different accounts of the murder and drastically different
descriptions of the murderer. And their accounts change; and Natty, growing
feverish through grief, guilt (over cowardice) and heat, keeps re-telling,
and re-living, his past with Jimmy with different emphasis. The different
versions of the same facts give this play a Rashomon-like quality.
Ultimately, however, the play
The Royal Court, Theatre Upstairs, until December 19 aims to link its
characters in a kind of moral coherence. It ends - too suddenly - in several
kinds of apotheosis. The conclusion is the play's most peculiar and least
satisfying feature, but every bit of it is riveting.
The playwright, Phillis Nagy, is American and gay. I like the fact that she
treats gay sexuality and gay society simply as objective facts, without
preaching any pro- or anti-gay sermons. To say that one wants to see more
work by her is true, but also condescending. Weldon Rising is achievement
enough. (At 75 minutes - no interval - it is, if anything, too short.)
I would like to speak more of the play's moral acuity - but what makes the
Weldon Rising audience most grateful is its precise characterisation,
first-rate dialogue, superb construction and fine acting. The most
noteworthy character, the transvestite Marcel, always talks of himself in
the third person. (Jaye: 'Why do you refer to yourself in the third person?
Marcel: 'Marcel is the third person.') This is entertaining; it also works
ironically in a play about spectators. The play interleaves past and present
powerfully; and Natty, speaking now with hindsight, even interviews Jimmy,
speaking as he did 15 years back - like the wise-after-the-fact
conversations we all have in our heads.
Every praise to the director, Penny Ciniewicz, for this co-production with
the Liverpool Playhouse Studio. And to the cast of six: Simon Gregor
(Natty), Andrew Woodall (Marcel), Melee Hutton (Tilly), Rosie Rowell (Jaye),
Paul Viragh (Jimmy) and Matthew Wait (the killer) all catch perfectly the
mixture of naturalism and irony in the writing. The action is taut, with not
an ounce of waste flesh. Seats in the middle of the rows are recommended.
Make an effort to ensure you arrive early enough to claim them.

HOME ALONE 2 (PG) John Hughes
INTO THE WEST (PG)(15) Mike Newell
ELENYA Steve Gough
TRACES OF RED (15) Andy Wolk
Home Alone 2 is surely one of the most carefully calculated movies ever
made. After the great popular success of its predecessor, writer/producer
John Hughes and his production team seem to have decided that a mere sequel
was not a safe enough bet. Instead, they have made a 'requel', a film which
shamelessly recreates the original on a scene-by-scene, gag-by-gag basis.
The title is a bit of a misnomer. This time young Kevin (Macaulay Culkin)
finds himself alone away from home, having become separated from his family
in a pre-Christmas scrum at Chicago's O'Hare airport. He winds up flying on
his own to New York, armed only with his father's credit card and his native
wits. Undaunted, he rents a room at The Plaza and manages to live the good
life until he crosses paths with the two burglars from the original film
(Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), just out of prison. After learning that they
plan to steal money intended for orphans, Kevin lures them to his uncle's
abandoned brownstone, where he subjects them to more or less the same
thrashing he administered in Christmas past.
From its opening scenes of confusion at Kevin's home to the final teary
reunion with his mother, the film looks like a weak Xerox of the original.
Both the same jokes and plotare trotted out - like the routine where Kevin
uses the soundtrack from an old movie to scare off threatening adults.
Whereas Hughes's writing possessed a manic unpredictability the first time
around, here it is little more than an exercise in problem solving, as he
laboriously sets up gags which Chris Columbus's robotic direction delivers
with all the subtlety of a brick in the face.
Another area in which Home Alone 2 fails to come through is in the
supporting performances, which went a long way towards saving the first
film. Pesci and Stern lack the clowning inventiveness of their earlier work.
Here, they are simply punching bags. Brenda Fricker's embarrassing
performance as a street person with a heart of gold shows how little
currency an Oscar statue provides in Hollywood these days. As for Culkin,
his doughty charm seems to be solidifying into something hard and
indigestible. Only Tim Curry's turn as an unctuous concierge really stands
out.
Still, the film is poised to become the biggest earner ever. Hughes
understands the same simple truth as people who manufacture children's
cartoons and fast food - young minds have no problem with a pleasing formula
being repeated ad nauseum. Given this, my only advice to those who find
Culkin's face as seasonally compelling as an angel atop the Christmas tree
would be to rent the video of the original Home Alone. It is the same story,
only fresher, funnier - and cheaper.
With an opening image of a white stallion racing down a windswept Irish
beach, Into the West leaves little doubt that its makers intend to take
their audience on a one way journey to Fable Country. Unfortunately, they
never quite reach their destination, creating a film that lacks the magic
needed for us to forgive its excesses.
It tells the story of a down-and-out gypsy king (Gabriel Byrne), who has
abandoned the travelling life for the dubious security of a Dublin tenement
after the death of his wife in childbirth. He lives in boozy misery with his
two young sons, unable to return to the road that is his destiny. Enter the
above mentioned white stallion, who befriends the boys, only to be stolen by
a corrupt millionaire who sees the horse as a potential champion show
jumper. The kids promptly take back what is rightly theirs, leading to a
cross-Ireland chase in which Byrne regains his dignity and his sons come to
terms with the loss of their mother.
The first half hour of the film is full of promise, with plenty of gentle
sentiment and knockabout horseplay, including a nice scene in which the
stallion is spirited to a tenth floor flat via the lift. But screenwriter
Jim Sheridan, who directed My Left Foot and The Field, milks the boys'
motherless status and dewey-eyed love for the horse for more than they are
worth.
The usually assured Mike Newell's direction is also surprisingly ham-fisted,
resorting to conventions such as having the bad guys enter to the sound of
bass cellos, the good guys to pipes and penny whistles. What the film does
feature are performances by young Ciaran Fitzgerald and Ruaidhri Conroy that
put Macaulay Culkin to shame. And I bet they cost a bit less to employ, as
well.
A more restrained account of youth can be found in Elenya, the story of a
12-year old girl who befriends a wounded German soldier after he parachutes
into her Welsh valley in 1940. Before his arrival, Elenya (Pascale Delafouge
Jones) leads a life of quiet desperation, derided by the locals after being
abandoned by her Italian-born mother and then her father, who leaves her
with a hated aunt when he goes off to fight in France. Then the handsome,
battered German flier appears on the scene. Elenya falls in love with him,
tending his injuries and trying in vain to keep him from the mitts of the
vindictive locals.
Writer/director Steve Gough's film is a carefully wrought study of youthful
alienation, helped by a fine performance by Jones. But in the end his
restraint gets the better of him. Too many of the crises he so carefully
establishes are left unresolved, most notably Elenya's dawning sexual
attraction for the airman.
Traces of Red is a by-the-numbers thriller that does not really add up. It
features James Belushi as a womanising Florida detective whose carefree ways
are spoiled when three women close to him, including two lovers, are
murdered. He wisely begins to suspect everybody, including his partner and
his politician brother. The remainder of the film consists of enough red
herrings to fill the Everglades.
Andy Wolk's film moves along at a good pace but fails to generate much heat
in doing so. Jim Piddock's screenplay knows where the plot twists should be
placed but has a hard time on the straights, where characters should be
developed and humor injected. And the fine character actors Belushi and
Lorraine Bracco are woefully miscast as romantic leads.

FT  10 DEC 92 / People: Swinson re-emerges at Stoy Hayward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Swinson, erstwhile national managing partner of BDO Binder
Hamlyn, has emerged from a period of uncharacteristic quiet to announce that
he will be joining rival accountancy firm Stoy Hayward on January 1.
Swinson will help build the firm's litigation support department, where he
joins Robert Watson, an existing partner who specialises in personal
litigation.
Swinson says he will focus on professional negligence, libel, contract
disputes and regulation issues, and is confident that the work will continue
to grow. 'In a recession people resort to the law more frequently,' he says.
'I can't believe that trend will decline.'
Swinson left BDO last June after being deposed from his position following a
coup by other senior partners in the firm. 'I've thoroughly enjoyed being on
my own, but it is not credible in the long-run to be totally divorced from
the coal-face,' he says. 'You can end up seeming too academic.'
He has been maintaining his extensive professional commitments in the past
few months, including joining the board of the Financial Reporting Review
Panel, the policing arm of Britain's new accounting standards body.
He also continued his studies for a law degree in London part-time, but says
he has no current plans to switch profession having built up capital in
accountancy.
Meanwhile, Swinson has wasted no time in applying his legal skills. He
recently served a writ against BDO for compensation and recovery of his
interests in the partnership. BDO has called the writ unwarranted and says
it will be strongly contested.

Peter Herke, a former director of Digital Equipment Company in the UK, has
joined Elonex, the fast-growing privately-owned north London personal
computer manufacturer. As sales and marketing director, he will be
responsible for strengthening the group's customer base and guiding its
expansion into new markets. One target will be the corporate local area
network sector where Elonex has already begun to make inroads.
Educated in Canada, Herke studied electrical engineering at the University
of British Columbia before taking an MBA at the LSE in 1965. In that year he
joined DEC as a computer salesman - the US group's 13th UK-based employee.
With the exception of four years in the 1970s managing a computer graphics
company he worked continuously for DEC until September. During his last year
he was md of DEC's small and medium enterprises in Europe.
'What is happening now with Elonex reminds me very much of the exciting
times at DEC in the 1960s and 1970s,' he says.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hays has announced the latest in a series of board changes at the business
services group which came to the market in 1989. Derrick Frost, 58, and
Peter Roberts 58, will both retire on December 31, as they had previously
agreed.
They will be replaced by Dennis Matthewman, 53, who joined Hays in 1983 and
is currently a divisional managing director, and Michael Proffitt, 45.
Proffitt joins Hays from the Ocean Group, where he was chief executive of
McGregor Cory, its contract distribution and specialised warehouse servicing
business.
These moves follow the appointment of David Tibble as finance director in
June, when Graham Williams relinquished that post to concentrate on the
group's acquisition strategy and European operations. Hays recently made its
first overseas acquisition - a French distribution company - and intends to
buy more distribution and commercial services companies on the continent.
Ronnie Frost, Hays' executive chairman, says the board is being reshaped in
the light of the group's strategy of doubling its size within the next three
years.
Headhunters are looking for one more executive director and the number of
non-executives may be increased from two to three. At the operational level,
the group has been split into 11 divisions, each with its own managing
director below main board level.

FT  10 DEC 92 / People: Wace board pressed smaller
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wace, the pre-press and specialist printing group, has decided to reduce the
size of its main board following last month's appointment of Trevor Grice as
chief executive.
Grice replaced John Clegg, whose sudden departure rocked the group at the
beginning of the year. The DTI has not yet completed a report into
share-dealing in the names of some of Clegg's relatives, but Wace insists
the inquiry has nothing to do with the group.
Wace has decided that increased responsibility should be given to various
operating boards within the group, leaving financial control and policy as
main board areas. Consequently executive directors Proby Cautley and Ian
Hewson are moving from the main to operating boards, reducing it to five
executive and three non-executive directors.
Grice says: 'The organisation structure has been a reflection of Wace's
acquisitive growth during the 1980s; there was an imbalance on the board
between executive and non-executive directors. These changes will provide a
better balance.'
Ian Wilde, 45, (above) has been appointed managing director of Wace Europe.
He joined Wace in January from Orion Holdings, where he was chief executive.
Wilde will report directly to Grice, with whom he previously worked for
eight years at Frank Horsell Group, the printing supplies company.
Jerry Lee, 40, has joined as UK sales and marketing director. Lee was a
director of Wang (UK) and from 1990 was responsible for its general business
systems division. He will report to Brian Dudley, Wace's managing director.
Neither Wilde nor Lee will be on the main board.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Reopening the road
to Rio - Christina Lamb on Brazilian eco-tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samba dancers, voluptuous girls in dental floss bikinis and football are the
images most people have of Brazil, according to Embratur, the state tourist
authority.
A marketing campaign by the Brazilian government and private sector aims to
change this in a desperate attempt to resuscitate the country's ailing
tourist industry.
Aimed at the travel trade and individual tourists, the focus is to show
Brazil as a paradise for eco-tourists.
The 'Natureland Brazil' campaign involves an advertising blitz and the use
of Brazilian musicians as 'ambassadors'.
It aims to show that Brazil has far more to offer than the picture postcard
resort of Rio which despite its beauty has become a liability because of its
huge crime rate.
The campaign marks a belated realisation of the need to invest money in
marketing to attract tourists. Unlike Mexico and Venezuela, which have
slapped travel posters on London buses and the New York subway, Brazil has
spent nothing.
The result, according to Varig, Brazil's largest airline, is that tourism
has more than halved to 900,000 visitors since 1985.
The Dollars 550,000 (Pounds 360,000) campaign is financed by Embratur, Varig
and American Express Brazil, and aims to double income from tourism to
Dollars 3bn in the next five years.
The campaign began last month with a US tour by Milton Nascimento, one of
Brazil's leading musicians who frequently sings about Indians and the
environment. Each concert starts and ends with a three-minute video showing
the country's environmental highlights.
Amex Brazil and Varig are running a campaign in specialist magazines under
the McCann Erickson-developed slogan: 'Feel the Brazilliance.' In addition
the two companies are sponsoring seminars for travel agents in US gateway
cities.
American Express is also direct mailing to 150,000 of its US cardholders.
The campaign is aimed at US tourists whose numbers have fallen largely
because of crime in Rio.
Joao Luis de Souza, commercial director of Varig, adds: 'What Brazil hasn't
done is to think of tourism as a professional activity to be explored using
management strategies, technology and marketing. It's all been very ad hoc
and now we're paying the price.'
To back up the campaign and make ecotourism viable, Varig is building hotels
and has created direct links from Europe and the US to cities such as
Recife, convenient for the beaches of the north east, or Manaus and Belem
for exploring the Amazon.
Although de Souza estimates that Brazil currently receives only
20,000-30,000 ecotourists a year, he says: 'The world is growing
increasingly conscious of the importance of preserving the environment for
the survival of mankind. It is inevitable that this will increase curiosity
for seeing the environment in its natural form and where better than
Brazil?'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Advisers with a new
idea - Ian Fraser looks at marketing services firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Providing strategic marketing advice to the fast-moving consumer goods
sector has been a traditional role of the advertising agency. But changes in
corporate marketing budgets and the advent of specialised marketing services
companies are steadily undermining the agencies' position.
'More and more clients have perhaps only 10 per cent of their time to devote
to advertising and no longer automatically have it at the top of the
marketing mix, says Ian McComas, Asda's former marketing director who is now
managing director of CIA Communications Management.
'Advertising agencies are limited in their ability to think beyond the scope
of advertising,' says Stella Hartley, marketing director of Sears
womenswear. 'But with retail brands you have to look outside advertising for
a solution to your marketing problems.'
The increase in corporate demand for outside marketing advice has been
boosted by growing demands on marketing managers' time. 'When you're bogged
down in the details of a brand, you don't always have the time to sit down
and look at broader strategic issues,' says Craig Duncan, senior brands
manager at United Distillers, which has used a marketing services firm, the
Added Value Company. 'They have more time to think these things through,' he
says.
The Added Value Company was formed in 1988 by Peter Dart and Mark
Sherrington, both former marketing directors with Unilever, who believed
there was demand for a 'marketing agency' capable of offering advice that
was strategic, creative and practical, yet independent of any single
marketing services discipline.
Sherrington believes companies such as his increasingly undermine the role
of traditional advertising agencies.
'What they are studiously doing is avoiding understanding how clients are
changing,' he said. 'All the areas where they offer no competitive advantage
 -like brand development, new brand development, media buying, production -
all are gradually being stripped away. All they're going to be left with is
the one area where they have competitive advantage, the creative development
of advertising.'
Duncan, however, believes that marketing agencies will not become dominant.
'It will remain an important and growing but niche area, because it's not
always easy to sell senior management the idea that you need someone else to
do what is effectively your job.'
Sherrington is more bullish, believing that if only there were a few more
marketing agencies around, the notion of having a separate brand development
budget would gain in acceptability.
A recent brand stretching exercise for Wedgwood illustrates how the company
operates. The initiative culminated in the international launch of an a
range of teas under the Wedgwood name, specifically in Japan and duty free
shops. 'It is not a question of trying to do the client's job,' says
Sherrington. 'The name of the game is working with them bringing to bear
creativity as well as strategy, perspective, objectivity and the ability to
cross reference from other markets.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hard times for soft
sell - Gary Mead reports that there is little sign of a pick up in
promotional spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If 1993 proves to be the year in which the international recession recedes,
loud sighs of relief are likely to be heard around the advertising industry.
But unlike earlier upturns, the next one may not be entirely to the liking
of advertising agencies. For although there are signs that the nadir may
have been reached in 1992, the return to growth is likely to be shallow and
slow, according to research published this week by Zenith Media Worldwide,
the UK-based media buying and planning operation of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
Zenith's latest bi-annual review of trends in advertising expenditure*
suggests that while 1992 will show another real decline of 0.2 per cent in
global spending, nominal growth of 5.3 per cent - which Zenith hesitantly
suggests will be marginally ahead of inflation - is forecast for 1993.
The report counsels caution: 'This is possibly one of the hardest
environments in which to provide an accurate forecast of trends. There is
much sentiment that markets generally must turn up sooner or later. There is
precious little hard evidence to support this view.'
It points out that the 1990 review identified four factors adversely
affecting consumer and business confidence - paralysis in US economic
policy, a slowing Japanese economy, German reunification problems and the
spectre of failed Gatt talks - that have yet to be resolved. The sole region
where Zenith projects real, year-on-year increases above 2 per cent between
now and 1995 is Asia-Pacific. Europe and North America, it says, will
struggle to register any real increases at all.
Zenith is forecasting aggregate growth in real terms of 8.2 per cent between
1993-95 for Asia-Pacific, against 2.4 per cent for Europe and 0.3 per cent
for North America.
The study projects global advertising spending through all media forms to
rise from Dollars 284bn (Pounds 187bn) in 1991 to Dollars 351bn in 1995.
Zenith's report is sceptical of any medium-term resurgence in advertising
expenditure in Europe. 'In the 1980s, demand for advertising time and space
was consistently greater than the market's ability to supply it,' leading to
excess demand and price inflation. 'We believe this excess demand has, for
the time being, evaporated,' says the report.
'Media is now available (in Europe) in sufficient quantity to satisfy
advertiser demand, but at a time when advertiser demand has been severely
weakened by recession,' it says. Rather than being driven by competition for
media space, European advertising levels are more likely to be propelled by
consumer expenditure and corporate profitability.
The report detects in the UK a 'continuing malaise', with 1992 due to record
the third successive year of real decline in advertising revenue, down by 2
per cent. Zenith expects 1993 to be 'little better, with growth of 2.9 per
cent at current prices. The ignominy of another real decline is only averted
by the exceptionally low forecast inflation rate of 2.6 per cent.'
However, the UK's position is distorted by the imminent demise of some of
the Independent Television network's franchise holders, such as TVS and
Thames. According to one London agency chief: 'Some companies about to lose
their franchises are willing to negotiate discounts of up to 25 per cent on
their rate cards.'
Peter Travis, joint managing director of the London-based agency Travis Dale
&amp; Partners, says: 'It's a good time to advertise if you have the money and
you feel there's a market because some TV costs will probably never be as
cheap.'
Moreover there are exceptions to the mood of caution. One of Travis Dale's
clients, Swatch, the internationally-minded watch manufacturer, increased
its advertising expenditure by 50 per cent this year compared with 1991.
Jaguar cars has returned to television advertising in the UK after a break
of 12 years, spending Pounds 2m.
But Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group,
says: 'The mood of our clients is very cautious. Many are saying: 'Our
budget for next year is the same as this. Maybe in the second half of 1993,
if we see the recession ending, we will increase it. But don't count on
it'.'

Andrew Baxter reports on British Gas's latest inspection system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a classic episode in the James Bond film The Living Daylights where
a defecting Soviet general is bundled into a pointy-nosed little vehicle and
sent hurtling through a large-bore pipeline to the west.
Much the same sort of experience can be had in real life, but only by
'intelligent pigs'. These are the machines developed over the past decade by
British Gas for checking the integrity of gas transmission pipes.
Intelligent pigs combine sophisticated mechanical engineering and software
expertise with 'magnetic flux leakage' technology - distortions in lines of
magnetic force from a huge magnet are measured to indicate any metal loss
from the pipe.
The pigs have given British Gas a worldwide reputation as a leader in
pipeline inspection systems. Now, from the British Gas Engineering Research
Station near Newcastle, comes the intelligent piglet. The bigger pigs were
developed so that British Gas could inspect its 17,000km of high-pressure
transmission pipelines without shutting them down.
The gas pressure pushes the pig through the pipe for several hundred
kilometres while it collects the data on the state of the pipeline walls.
The pipeline diameter can be as large as 48 inches.
The piglets, meanwhile, are aimed at the 230,000km British Gas distribution
network. The machines can be used in six-inch, eight-inch and 12-inch mains
pipes made of cast iron or the newer, tougher ductile iron. Together, these
account for 62 per cent of the network.
Distribution mains give the piglet a bumpier ride, with more bends, valves,
joints and service connections, so the machine has to be extra tough, with
refinements in the joints to ease it round the bends.
Unlike its bigger forbears, the piglet has to be winched through up to 400
metres of pipework in one journey - there is not enough gas pressure to push
it through. The winch rope is made of Kevlar - steel rope would damage the
pipe as it pulls the pig round a bend. An umbilical cord at the rear end
provides power for the electromagnet and sends back data for computer
analysis.
The first piglet has been running with North West Gas for the past year, but
British Gas plans to use them more widely from next year. This will help the
company work out a replacement policy for its ductile iron pipes, first
introduced in the mid-1960s.
But the so-called Ductile Iron Magnetic Pig can be adapted for the less
uniform magnetic characteristics of cast iron. Gerald Clerehugh, group
director of research and technology, sees a wide market for the product
outside the gas industry, for example in welded steel pipes used in
refineries.
Scientists at Newcastle are continuing work on the piglet so that it can
work under 'live' conditions - with the gas still turned on. Rival US and
Japanese systems are being developed for distribution pipes but, according
to Clerehugh, 'nobody has yet matched the intelligent pig on quality'.

Disaster recovery is not a cheap option. CDRS's John Ratliff quotes rates of
between Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 15,000 a year to obtain access to a 'cold
site' - a computer room without computers - whenever disaster strikes, with
an additional amount payable depending on the time the site is occupied.
'Hot sites' - which are computer rooms with computers in place, tested and
ready to use - are more expensive, with costs ranging from Pounds 30,000 to
Pounds 200,000 a year. Again an additional amount is payable on occupancy.
CDRS quotes a maximum 'hot site' occupancy fee of Pounds 25,000 with an
additional Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000 for each day the site is occupied.
Occupancy of 'hot sites' is restricted by CDRS to an eight-week period,
although the company ensures clients can maintain the continuity of their
business through other services if a disaster victim is unable to return to
its own facilities.
Safetynet quotes average fees of Pounds 14,500 per year for access to its
hot sites, which are typically smaller.
From this relatively basic levels the industry is developing in two
inter-related directions.
Companies such as Failsafe Roc and Safetynet are also offering more
comprehensive contingency planning. Large corporations could pay up to
Pounds 150,000 for such a plan - with additional amounts payable for an
annual review.
In addition, disaster recovery services are offering more sophisticated
products designed to reduce the time taken in making back-up computer tapes.
Typically, a large bank or insurance company will make duplicate tapes at
least once a day which it will store in security archives.
A range of techniques such as 'electronic vaulting', 'remote journaling' and
'database shadowing' allows companies to minimise the recovery time caused
by periodic back-ups.
According to Ratliff, these methods allow companies to survive computer
disasters with minimal disruption. Ensuring 'business continuity' is likely
to dominate developments in the sector.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Technology: Picking up the pieces - Richard Lapper explores
the growing market for computer disaster recovery services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Ratliff, who heads European marketing for the world's biggest computer
disaster recovery company, Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services of the US,
says he is anxious not to sound 'like an ambulance chaser'.
But he accepts that the British mainland bombing campaign by the IRA has
given a new fillip to the business of computer disaster recovery, in which
CDRS's UK subsidiary, Failsafe Roc, is a market leader.
Last month's announcement by UK insurers that they will withdraw cover for
terrorism from conventional insurance policies beginning next year, has
spurred interest in a product which was already attracting growing interest.
'As people are forced to review their insurance arrangements, they are
becoming aware that the next best thing is contingency planning,' says
Charles Shaw, director of consultancy at Safetynet, another market leader.
Services offered by disaster recovery companies range from the provision of
alternative customised office space to parallel computer facilities, which
automatically duplicate every detail entered in a company's day-to-day
operations - producing an immediate up-to-date copy of all transactions and
comprehensive disaster recovery plans.
The UK market for such services is growing at between 25 to 30 per cent each
year, according to industry estimates.
Datanews, a public relations agency which specialises in the IT field, says
around a dozen companies, including Failsafe Roc, Safetynet, IBM, Datashield
and Computer Disaster Recovery, are now competing in a market worth up to
Pounds 150m a year in fee income.
Failsafe Roc specialises in providing services to users of IBM mainframe
computers, and has 700 clients in the UK. Safetynet has 350 clients,
including 120 financial institutions, and specialises in mid-range IBM
AS/400 computers.
Underpinning the growth is the increasing dependence by nearly all of the
financial services sector and increasing numbers of manufacturing companies
on computers and electronic flows of information.
Banks and insurance companies, for example, need to maintain electronic fund
transfer or claims payment systems, while many manufacturers and retailers
are reliant on techniques such as 'just-in-time' warehousing in order to
reduce the cost of holding stocks of raw materials or products.
Frequently, relatively small accidents - a labourer accidentally cutting
fibre optic cable, for example - can lead to big losses of information and
money and potentially the business itself.
'If you're in the finance industry, every minute down can mean several
millions of pounds lost. If denied use of computer systems, the clock starts
ticking and the bank loses three days' business it will never get back,'
says Ratliff.
'People have this wonderful misconception of what a disaster is; they think
it is a flood or a fire. Actually it is when you can't use a computer - and
the most common reason is hardware failure,' says Colin Appleby, industry
analyst with Datanews.
At the same time, demand for disaster recovery services is growing because
companies are taking a more sophisticated view of how to manage the
day-to-day risks of conducting their businesses.
Already, many bigger companies now invest in risk prevention - buying
fail-safe mechanisms for electronic equipment or installing sprinklers in
warehouses, for example - as well as buying conventional insurance.
In the same way, many risk managers now prepare contingency plans, which
spell out what senior managers must do when a disaster does occur.
'Awareness is so much higher than it has ever been before. Five years ago
people would say: 'I've got insurance'. Now they realise that insurance is
not going to look after everything,' says Shaw.
'If you are a bank and you take a hit that makes your facilities
inoperable,' says Ratliff, 'all the insurance payments in the world won't
necessarily save you money.'
Ironically, many of the companies affected by the IRA bomb in the City of
London last April successfully implemented disaster recovery plans, reducing
losses due to computer damage.
Even so, most of the estimated Pounds 750m in claims stems from loss of
income rather than from damage to property. So the explosions served to
demonstrate the potential scale of business interruption losses.
John Athawes, marketing development manager for Commercial Union Risk
Management, which offers disaster recovery services, says his company is
receiving 'serious' inquiries at the rate of 10 per week over the past few
months. 'Major organisations, particularly banks and building societies, are
taking this very seriously,' says Athawes.
A conference which focused on Commercial Union's own highly successful
disaster recovery, which was brought into play when its own offices were
destroyed by the April bomb, attracted 300 delegates.
Peter Sommer, of computer consultancy Virtual City Associates, says that
even if insurers are persuaded to offer cover for business interruption or
losses caused by terrorists, they are likely to insist that policyholders
have disaster recovery plans in place.
'You have to place these things together. No one will offer cover for
business interruption or consequential loss if they don't understand the
steps the policyholder will take to recover from a loss,' he says.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Accountancy Column: Recession hinders efforts to improve
racial mix - Few applicants and even fewer recruits mean only 1.6% of
trainees are black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUNJAY KAKAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE turning to the last report of the Commission for Racial Equality on
discrimination in the accountancy profession six years ago was in for some
unpleasant reading. Now the impact of the recession is threatening to stall
any further progress.
The CRE report, published in 1986, showed that the proportion of white
candidates hired by the larger firms was about four times higher than for
black applicants. The white success rate at interview was nearly twice as
high, with a slightly higher disparity at second compared with first
interview. Black applicants were disproportionately rejected at all stages.
It recommended that improved recruitment, assessment and selection
techniques would not only reduce these disparities, but also assist the
profession to solve its own graduate recruitment shortage.
The situation today remains hard to assess, because reliable statistics are
still not available. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales began ethnic monitoring of candidates in 1988 but a significant number
of trainees signing contracts are still reluctant to provide this
information. For 1991-92, the proportion of training contacts held by black
students was 1.6 per cent, and for Asians 8.4 per cent.
The impending shortage of young professionals in the early 1980s prompted
accountancy firms to adapt their recruitment practices. Mr Richard Parnell,
a director at Robert Walters Associates, says: 'Certain firms were making
little effort to give people from ethnic minorities any equal opportunity.
They then realised that they had to get all hands on board. They turned to
all sections of the community.'
Gradually the ethnic mix has been changing. Mr Stephen Boley, national
director of graduate recruitment at Coopers and Lybrand, says that of his
firm's junior grades, 8 per cent come from ethnic minorities. 'This reflects
the higher percentage now coming through the higher education system,' he
says. 'We expect this to work through to higher grades in the coming years.
Currently we have only one partner from an ethnic minority.'
Lack of representation at senior levels is also true in the professional
bodies. Mr Prem Sikka, a lecturer at the University of East London, points
out that there is not a single ethnic minority on an important committee in
the accountancy profession. 'The people running these committees will not
see it as a deliberate decision, but it has always been that way so they are
institutionalising unequal opportunities,' he says.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants points out that it does have a small
number of people from ethnic minorities on some of its committees.
One reason for continued under-representation is the concentration by firms
on recruiting from a small number of long-established universities. By
contrast, most ethnic minorities attend the modern universities and
polytechnics and those in London. In the capital each college draws more
than one quarter of its intake from ethnic minorities, though many of these
are foreign students who could not be employed.
Mr Nigel Llewellyn, national recruitment partner at Touche Ross, defends his
firm's strategy. 'Some campuses have more potential applicants of better
quality, so it makes sense that we direct a greater proportion of marketing
spend to those areas where it will yield the best results,' he says. 'This
does not mean that a candidate from a campus which has not been targeted in
this way stands less chance of receiving an offer.'
In the late 1980s, firms were keen to look beyond their traditional pool of
applicants. With the recession, much of that impetus has been lost. Mr
Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, says: 'Many accountancy firms
still only recruit actively from a limited number of universities because
that is where they have met their best graduates in the past. That is
rational economic behaviour on their part. Unfortunately the recession has
probably narrowed this recruitment base further.'
Firms are nevertheless adopting a number of tactics to counter potential
discrimination. Ms Faith Jenner, UK director of recruiting and personnel at
Arthur Andersen, says more than one person considers each candidate in order
to eliminate any chance of individual bias creeping in. 'We aim to recruit
the best so it is very much in our interest to help interviewees feel
comfortable,' she says. 'That way we see them at their best and can gauge
their potential better.'
Mr Llewellyn says that a big element of interviewer training at Touche Ross
is focused on the need to eliminate bias. 'These procedures have proved very
effective over the last ten years,' he says. 'Sadly, a deeper issue remains,
which is that the number of applicants from minority backgrounds with proven
academic strength is disappointingly low, particularly in the case of those
from the Afro-Caribbean Community. If more would apply the final position
would be much improved.'
Ms Jo Magne, national personnel manager at Moores Rowland, agrees. 'We
closely monitor graduate applications and have traditionally received very
few from African or Afro-Caribbean candidates,' she says. 'Asian candidates
apply in higher numbers.'
The firm's recruitment figures for the last four months of last year
highlight the problem. Two-thirds of applicants to the firm were European,
of which 47 per cent were invited to a first interview. Asians comprised 30
per cent of applicants, but 37 per cent of them were invited for interview.
But for Africans/Afro-Caribbeans, the figures were 4 per cent who applied
and 16 per cent invited for interview.
Ms Magne says that African and Afro-Caribbean applicants are generally not
invited to interview because of their lack of research into the profession
and their inability to provide a sensible answer to the question of why they
want to be a chartered accountant.
That is a view shared by Mr Errol Elliot, chairman of the recently-formed
Black Accountants Society. He argues that accountancy has a low profile in
the black community and many black applicants carry out insufficient
research into the profession. 'The bottom line is that the accountancy exams
are tough and time-consuming,' says Mr Elliot. 'We are there to provide
support so that black students realise that the exams are there to be
passed.'
Mr Deepak Haria, a manager in the financial markets division at Arthur
Andersen, who was seconded to the firm's recruitment department for seven
months in 1990, says that firms should not under-estimate the importance of
using role-models to attract high quality graduates from all backgrounds.
'It is the diversity of skills, knowledge and background of an accounting
firm's workforce which contributes to its present business success and
future growth.'
Mr Philip Nagenda, a black African chartered accountant and head of internal
audit for three NHS authorities, has observed that many clients have
difficulties coping with the idea of a black senior auditor. 'If there is a
black person in a team of two or more auditors, they automatically assume
that the black person is the junior auditor,' he says. 'This stereotyping
will not change until we have more black accountants.'
While the economy was growing, the increase in demand for recruits by the
leading accounting firms coincided with the emergence of a second generation
of highly educated ethnic minorities who were joining the job market. But
the present recession is so intense that the demand for young professionals
has been reduced and accountancy firms can afford to make less effort to
widen their ethnic base.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley urges move on Maxwell cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Lilley, social security secretary, yesterday increased pressure on
trustees and others to take urgent action to disentangle the amounts
available to the various Maxwell pension schemes. He also warned that he did
not intend to provide further government help for the pensioners.
He told MPs on the cross-party social security committee that he had made no
provision in his departmental budget next year for further assistance to the
pensioners, and spoke of a 'growing sense of impatience' that, more than a
year after the scandal had broken, the Pounds 100m-plus in the Common
Investment Fund had still not been allocated.
Latest estimates of the realised or realisable value of the fund are about
Pounds 140m, of which more than Pounds 97m is still under dispute. 'I hope
that trustees, liquidators and lawyers and others trying to reach agreement
will have a renewed sense of urgency,' Mr Lilley said.
'It would be wrong to assume that this can be allowed to linger and that the
taxpayer will foot the bill.'
Under pressure himself from Mr David Shaw, one of the Tory committee
members, he insisted that the focus of attention should be the fund.
Mr Patrick Harrex of Law Debenture Corporation, trustee of the Maxwell
Communication pension plan, said Mr Lilley's remarks were 'rather simplistic
although understandable'.
'All the trustees are certainly working very closely to do something,' he
said. 'We are as keen as anyone to draw the money out. But there are a small
number of very significant transactions which need to be disentangled.'
He said it was almost inevitable that there would need to be legal action
between the trustees of the different pensions funds to determine ownership.
He expected this to take up to one year to resolve, but discussions were
well advanced on a mechanism to use money from the fund in the meantime.
About Pounds 1m remained from the Pounds 2.5m set aside by the government to
provide a 'drip feed' for the pension funds until the money in the fund
could be allocated, Mr Lilley said.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Family's regal image tainted again
 -Malcolm Rutherford on the position of the House of Windsor in Major's
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME people are indifferent to the British monarchy; a minority is opposed
to it. What cannot be denied, however, is that it runs through the whole
fabric of British life.
Last year alone the royal family undertook 3,270 official engagements in the
UK - 10 per cent up on 1990. Some of those may be considered largely social,
but they extend across the whole range of charities, health and education.
They also include business. There can scarcely be a businessman in the land
who would not welcome a new plant being opened by a royal - and the more
senior the better. Equally, there are few people in British life who turn
down honours, or even invitations to garden parties.
The definition of the sovereign's role has long been accepted as 'to advise,
to encourage and to warn'. It is not indispensable. Yet if the monarchy were
under challenge, it is unlikely that other institutions would survive closer
scrutiny: the House of Lords, for example, and a whole edifice of patronage
and deference.
The monarchy has been unpopular or the subject of great controversy or both
before and survived. Queen Victoria in mid-reign seemed alienated from her
subjects, but she won back affection in her old age.
Nothing that has happened in the royal entourage in the past few years is
remotely on a scale of the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936. Mr John Major,
the prime minister, has been closely involved in the final stages of this
particular drama but, during the abdication crisis, whole prime ministerial
meetings were taken up with the matter for nearly a year. The difference
then was that the affair was not discussed in the British press.
Without the press, it is arguable that everything would be much smoother
today. Yet it is wishful thinking to believe that the press will draw back.
Moreover, royal watchers argue that they are merely reflecting a popular
mood. When the Prince of Wales married Lady Diana in July 1981, the nation
cheered. It was only 18 months later, however, that gossip columnists began
to report that not all was well.
Initial press comment tended to concentrate on the younger members of the
family, yet gradually the pack began to close in on anyone who could be
exposed. Public opinion began to change. A Mori poll in May 1984 suggested
that only 5 per cent of those polled thought the country would be better off
without a monarchy, while 16 per cent thought that abolition would make no
difference. In May 1992 the percentage of those believing that the country
would be better off had risen to 14. More significantly, as many as 32 per
cent thought that abolition would make no difference. Only 50 per cent
thought that the country would be worse off.
An NOP poll early this year found that 84 per cent of respondents believed
the Queen should pay income tax on her private income. A few months later
the Queen volunteered to do just that, and the formal decision was announced
by Mr Major last month.
The Queen herself can be confident about her future. In the late 1980s there
was much talk about a possible abdication to make way for Prince Charles.
The Queen firmly stamped on that in a Christmas broadcast and recent polls
show that the number who believe that she should stay as long as possible
has risen. The Mori poll in May this year found that 85 per cent think there
will still be a monarchy in 10 years' time, though only 46 per cent in 50
years' time.
Nevertheless, the Queen and Queen Mother, who is literally as old as this
century, have shielded the younger royals and the monarchy itself with their
huge popularity. Yesterday's announcement has dented that shield and will
expose Britain's most famous institution to more, not less, scrutiny.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mortgage lenders warn on further
base-rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHOEBE KING and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES are unlikely to be able to pass on the full amount of any
further cuts in base rates because they have to maintain their rates on
savings products, leaders of the mortgage lending industry said yesterday.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said that
because interest on long - term investments was now higher than on
short-term savings products, building societies could not lower mortgage
rates much further.
He told the Treasury and Civil Service committee: 'The extent to which we
will be able to reflect further reductions in base rates will be limited.' A
reduction of 1 percentage point was 'just not on'.
The statement came after a call by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, for
building societies to pass on the whole of recent base-rate cuts to lenders.
Societies say they have to widen margins in order to compensate for mortgage
losses.
Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Building Societies Association, said
lenders would be wrong to reduce rates and then put them up to restore
profitability.
The association said in written evidence to the committee that the industry
was suffering a net outflow of savings funds this year because of
competition from longer term investments.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, said the bank's overall
margin on domestic lending had fallen over the past 10 years. He said the
scope to raise margins was limited by the lack of demand, and market
competition.
He told MPs it was not bank policy to widen margins and the average
difference between the rate charged and the cost of funding loans had
narrowed about 0.5 per cent in the past year.
The average margin was 2.8 per cent in 1991 compared with about 2.3 per cent
around the middle of this year, he said.
Mr Pitman denied increasing margins on loans to small businesses to support
profits in the recession.
He strongly denied claims that bank charges were tipping companies into
bankruptcy.
'It's not in our interests to push a company into liquidation,' he said,
adding that Lloyds was 'sharing the pain' with its customers.
Mr Pitman also said the worst of the recession appeared to have passed and
signs of recovery were growing.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, is inquiring into
reports that insider rings of solicitors and estate agents are manipulating
the market in repossessed homes.
Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, told the Commons
yesterday that Sir Bryan would consider taking action against individuals
under the 1979 Estate Agents Act.
Under the act the director-general may, in certain circumstances, prohibit
individuals from engaging further in estate agency work.
