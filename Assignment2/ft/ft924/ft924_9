FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley outlines anti-fraud plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Lilley, social security secretary, yesterday outlined the extent of
his crackdown on benefit fraudsters, which is expected to save up to Pounds
1bn a year.
His department is conducting an anti-fraud operation to save about Pounds
500m this financial year and up to Pounds 1bn in future years.
Mr Lilley was amplifying the details disclosed in the Autumn Statement to
MPs on the Commons select committee on social security.
Extra investigators using better computer systems able to cross-check claims
and identify 'risk categories' will be deployed, he told the committee.
Local authorities will get incentives to join in the crackdown, possibly
saving Pounds 50m on housing and council tax benefits alone.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs seek facts on Lamont donation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WATCHDOGS on MPs' financial dealings have stopped short of launching an
inquiry into Mr Norman Lamont's alleged failure to report an Pounds 18,000
donation from Conservative party sources to help pay his legal bills for
evicting a tenant, Ivo Dawnay writes.
Instead, the Commons' committee on members' interests yesterday asked three
Labour backbench complainants to give more details of the alleged breach of
rules. It offered the chancellor an opportunity to tell his side of the
story.
The committee is scheduled to meet again next week to examine the question
further.
The complaint from Ms Alice Mahon, Mr Alan Milburn and Mr Geoffrey Hoon
argued that Mr Lamont should have registered the payment to comply with
strict rules governing MPs' financial dealings.
The committee must first decide whether the donation was a private gift or
whether it could be deemed to relate to the chancellor's performance of his
duties as a member of the House.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Plea to EC on fishing curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN last night called on the European Commission to withdraw fish
conservation proposals that would require some British trawlers to be
confined to port for at least 10 consecutive days each calendar month.
Sir Hector Monro, junior Scottish office minister, told the Commons that if
the Commission failed to respond British ministers would 'vigorously' oppose
the proposals when the EC fisheries council meets for talks in Brussels next
week.
While acknowledging that British fishermen felt they had had a 'very rough
ride this year' through enforcement of conservation quotas, he insisted that
some restrictions would continue to be necessary.
Sir Hector explained that the government was trying to find a 'halfway
house' which would avoid British trawlers being tied up in port on
consecutive days.
The government had agreed a programme for the next four years which would
reduce fishing right across the UK fleet through a combination of
decommissioning and licensing measures. 'In this context a 10-day tie-up
targeted at a particular group of boats is unnecessary and inappropriate,'
he said.
Sir Hector confirmed that provisions in the Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill
would enable the government to control the number of days which fishing
vessels spent at sea next year.
Mr Gavin Strang, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, said the government's
failure to introduce a properly managed and socially acceptable
de-commissioning scheme had made a substantial contribution to the 'crisis'
in the industry.
A scheme was needed that provided compensation for all engaged in the
industry and not just for the owners of fishing vessels.
Challenged by Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, about the cost of such a
scheme, Mr Strang retorted that Labour was not advocating that it should be
'on the cheap - far from it'.
Mr Curry said Pounds 25m spread over three years was 'on the table' for a
de-commissioning scheme, 75 per cent provided by the British taxpayer.
He emphasised that a de-commissioning scheme and a system to limit fishing
through 'effort control' would have to go together.
The government secured a majority of 81 (294-213) to defeat a Labour attack
on its conduct of fisheries policy.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MoD takes blame for misspent funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of public money to pay for extravagant parties, go-karts and theatre
tickets was an 'institutional failure', Sir Christopher France, permanent
under secretary to the Ministry of Defence, told MPs yesterday.
The Commons public accounts committee called Sir Christopher to explain why
Pounds 1.2m, intended to reward MoD personnel for the success of a
cost-cutting programme which saved Pounds 2.3bn over three years, was
misspent, causing the National Audit Office to qualify the MoD accounts for
1990-91. The Pounds 1.2m formed 13 per cent of the budget allocated to the
incentive and reward scheme.
Parties on the HMS Argus and HMS Galahad to celebrate the 25th anniversary
of the Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service accounted for Pounds
129,000. Other unauthorised expenditure included 56 coaches and minibuses in
Germany, golf club memberships, a caravan and fish tanks.
'I think the failure stretched from headquarters right through the system,'
Sir Christopher said.
He said the amount of money involved was not large, but said: 'It is not
small change - it is like the housemaid's baby, it should not be there at
all.'
He blamed ambiguities in the scheme's guidelines for some of the problems.
According to the guidelines, the fund was to reward 'the whole defence
community', meaning that civilians as well as service personnel should
benefit.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Time to tempt fate - Political
Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be too serious an affront to fate to state with confidence that the
government has turned the corner. Too many things could yet go wrong -
tomorrow's Edinburgh summit among them.
Hard experience has taught ministers that the green shoots now re-appearing
in parts of the economy are as likely to wither as flourish.
And yet there has been a palpable lightening in the mood at Westminster.
Conservative MPs are learning to smile again. Ministers are whispering that
perhaps, just perhaps, the worst is over.
A cabinet minister confessed this week that last Sunday was the first since
September that he managed to spend in his garden. Labour MPs have lost some
of the spring from their step. Some have taken to sniping at Mr John Smith
instead of harrying the government.
In part, the change is simply a reflection of the relative optimism in
London's financial markets. It has been some time since ministers have woken
up to headlines declaring that international investors are switching funds
into sterling. Their City contacts tell them that the stockmarket's recent
strength is well-founded.
Conservative MPs have noticed also a change in their constituencies.
Local party activists are still deeply gloomy about unemployment and house
prices. But they detect a sense that things are no longer getting worse:
there may be few visible signs of recovery but nor is their evidence that
the economy is still sliding further into slump.
The same sort of judgments are being made in the Treasury. For the first
time in recent memory an economic forecast has survived a month. The
prediction in the Autumn Statement of a slow and anaemic recovery next year
remains credible.
Ministers believe that the economic forecasters may have learnt their lesson
and have erred on the side of pessimism.
There are other straws in the wind.
In the wake of the crises over sterling, the coal industry and Maastricht,
the machinery of government froze. Political survival replaced governing the
country. With ministers looking no more than two or three days ahead, their
departments stopped producing the paperwork essential to decision-making.
Crisis management replaced forward planning.
That paralysis has lifted. Ministers have started to think ahead again.
Downing Street has begun to set again the performance targets essential to
kick-start the machine into life. Ministers have been told to come up with
medium-term strategies for their departments.
Mr Kenneth Clarke at the Home Office is promising the sort of radical reform
of the police and prison services which he delivered at the health
department.
At education Mr John Patten is turning his mind from reading lists for
14-year-olds to a dramatic extension of technical education for
16-to-19-year-olds at further education colleges.
More immediately, ministers have been asked to offer in the new year their
contributions to Mr Michael Heseltine's commitment to ease the regulatory
burden on business.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, a bright young Treasury minister who carries little
ideological baggage, has been charged with giving substance to the pledge of
greater private sector involvement in big infrastructure projects.
Behind the scenes there is evidence also that the government's
acknowledgement that manufacturing industry counts will be translated into
policy. Mr Heseltine is busy changing the institutional framework for the
government's relations with industry. Downing Street says he has the prime
minister's full backing.
The aid package for industry unveiled in the Autumn Statement has produced
the beginning of a cultural change in Whitehall. Business is no longer faced
with a reflex accusation of whingeing when it asks for help.
This does not add to a programme for government. Ministers are acutely
conscious that after the horrors of the past few months Mr Major's
administration lacks anything that could pass muster as a central ambition.
Nor do they have much idea of how economic policy will operate over the
medium term. The government can no longer promise even to cut taxes.
Even a successful summit will not banish the arguments over Britain's place
in Europe. Ratifying the Maastricht treaty will undoubtedly be a painful
process for Mr Major. Failure to ratify would end his premiership.
For now, Mr Major's colleagues believe it may be enough simply to have
survived. Success these days is measured in strictly relative terms.
A batch of bad economic indicators or a debacle in Edinburgh would shatter
the calm. But maybe, just maybe, it is time to tempt fate.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher backs Patten over China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS THATCHER, the former prime minister, last night used a Lords debate
on Hong Kong and China to make a spirited defence of Mr Chris Patten, the
colony's governor.
Other speakers - including two former governors - expressed regret and alarm
at the possible consequences of the row between Britain and China but Lady
Thatcher praised her former cabinet colleague for his 'great sensitivity and
skill'.
She described the controversial October speech in which Mr Patten outlined
proposals to extend the scope of democracy in Hong Kong as splendid and
magnificently constructed. The governor had not proposed anything that
conflicted with the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration.
In common with other speakers, Lady Thatcher emphasised that Mr Patten's
proposals were 'only a basis for discussion' and expressed 'great
disappointment' that China had so far declined to make its contribution to
the debate.
But while sincerely wishing it will prove possible to 'proceed along with'
China, 'this cannot be at the expense of what we believe to be right,' she
warned. 'In the last resort, it is Britain that has responsibility for
governing Hong Kong up to 1997.'
Lady Thatcher also used the occasion to broadcast a message to the incoming
Clinton administration in the United States that it would be 'profoundly
misguided' to put pressure on China over human rights by restricting trade.
President George Bush had been 'excellently right' to resist using that
blunt weapon, she said.
In his maiden speech in the Lords, Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, Mr Patten's
predecessor as governor, commended the way his successor had endeared
himself to the people of Hong Kong but expressed alarm at the intensity and
implications of the dispute.
He hoped other proposals would indeed be put forward 'so there may be a
chance to find a structure for the 1995 elections which will be satisfactory
to the people of Hong Kong'.
The continuity which had been one of the chief aims and achievements of the
joint declaration was a very important objective for Hong Kong.
Lord Maclehose of Beoch, another former governor, said the violence with
which the Chinese had responded to the proposals had produced what was
approaching a crisis with progress apparently blocked.
He said the Chinese appeared to have a point that the spirit if not the
letter of the 1990 agreement has been breached. If passed into law, Mr
Patten's proposals would operate only from 1995 until 1997. Mr Patten 'may
have been misdirected over these proposals, but I am sure he has the
political experience, flexibility and indeed charisma to lead Hong Kong back
into a working political relationship with China.'
Baroness Dunn, a senior member of Hong Kong's executive council, said
Britain bore a share of the blame for the current predicament. Was it really
surprising, after a history of deals 'cut behind closed doors' that the
Chinese government should find the new British openness of approach
difficult to comprehend, she asked.
Baroness Chalker, foreign office minister, accused China of 'increasingly
strident propaganda attacks.'

benefit, but this was interpreted as meaning that families of servicemen

Confusion over whether senior finance officers needed to be consulted on
spending added to the irregularities.
Sir Christopher defended the fact that only one senior finance officer and
one line manager had been rebuked, and no formal disciplinary proceedings
had been started. 'A judgement was made that at the time that in the
circumstances it would not stand up if we took it through to the
disciplinary tribunal,' he said.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prince praises World Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRINCE of Wales called last night for an expansion of the BBC World
Service in a speech to mark the 60th anniversary of the service.
Speaking hours after the announcement that he and Princess Diana were
separating, Prince Charles told a reception in London's Guildhall that
'whether we deserve it or not - and often whether we have funded it or not -
the World Service has come up with a broadcasting formula that is the envy
and admiration of the world.'
The World Service, which has an estimated 120m regular listeners, was
important to Britain's economic and political interests abroad.
'Wherever I have travelled, countless British businessmen have told me how
commercial opportunities only come about when an atmosphere of understanding
already exists,' the Prince said.
The government's green paper on the BBC had asked whether the corporation
should continue to expand its services for international audiences through
the World Service and World Service Television.
'The answer should surely be yes. The troubles of the world show no sign of
abating. Civil war, whether in eastern Europe or Africa, is rampant;
repressive systems deny human rights to their citizens; hunger and disease
and appalling corruption are rife,' Prince Charles argued.
It was essential for those who strive for solutions to be able to establish
the true facts and know that there is a point of reference to which everyone
can turn. 'The World Service is just such a credible source of information,'
he said.
The Prince also praised the view of Mr John Tusa, the retiring managing
director of the World Service, that a strong service could only exist within
a strong BBC.
'There is no doubt that all organisations may need restructuring from time
to time, as part of the process of renewal,' he said.
'We surely need to be absolutely certain in this case that the changes are
actually for the best.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Shephard says 26,000 jobs at risk near mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 26,000 jobs would be lost in addition to the 30,000 mining
redundancies if all 31 pits proposed by British Coal closed, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, the employment secretary, said yesterday.
Mrs Shephard was giving evidence to the Commons employment committee which
is investigating the proposed closure of pits.
The committee is also looking at the effect on employment and the
effectiveness of efforts to find new jobs. Organisations representing miners
claim as many as 70,000 jobs could be lost.
Mrs Shephard said estimates suggested 17,000 jobs would be lost among
contractors with a further 3,000 to 6,000 jobs at risk in the surrounding
areas. About 3,000 transport jobs would be lost, 2,800 of them in British
Rail.
Mrs Shephard said unemployment in pit areas was already higher than average.
Mrs Shephard said some areas affected by the closures were likely to receive
assisted area status designation and her department was contributing to a
new map for these which would include criteria to do with unemployment.
Mrs Shephard was questioned about how far in advance her department knew
about the closures. She said her department was 'aware' of the scale of the
closures in the summer. The number of closures was indicated to her
department the week before the announcement, but nothing had been put in
writing at that stage.
Meanwhile mining equipment industry representatives warned the Commons trade
and industry committee yesterday of big job losses if the government's pit
closure plan went ahead.
Ms Beverley Webster, vice-president of the Association of British Mining
Equipment Companies, said the industry's workforce would fall from 22,000 to
less than 7,000 if the number of UK mines was cut from 50 to 20 as proposed.
The trade and industry committee also heard that the nuclear fuel industry
believes it could handle the spent fuel from the UK's Magnox power stations
if they were closed to help the coal industry.
Mr John Guinness, chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, the state-owned
reprocessing company, told the committee early closure of the magnoxes would
be 'feasible' but 'most uneconomic'.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Threatened pits classed as efficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWELVE PITS on British Coal's original closure list of 31 are capable of
producing at internationally competitive rates within two years, a report
said yesterday.
Two of them, Trentham in Staffordshire and Betws in south Wales, are among
10 pits scheduled to shut at the end of January after a 90-day review.
The report says the 12 are among BC's best 27 pits. All 27 could produce
below the import price of Pounds 1.30 a gigajoule that the report considers
internationally competitive. The combined output would be 50m to 66m tonnes
a year.
The report was written by Alan Oakes and Associates, a consultancy that has
done work before for the government on British Coal's efficiency.
McCloskey Coal Information Services, publisher of the report, said that
suggested new technologies and working practices, if implemented, would
displace 15m tonnes of imported coal in two years' time. The additional
market for British coal would save up to 10 pits initially, it said.
The efficiency measures would lead to significant job losses in existing
pits and in those saved. Oakes estimated that the average number of miners
in each would fall by half to achieve efficiencies.
Oakes said productivity could triple if British Coal adopted the continuous
mining and roof bolting techniques used abroad, increased shift hours,
introduced team work and reduced supervisory staff.
Mr Alan Oakes of the consultancy said British Coal had set a modest target
for improving productivity, up from 1,500 tonnes of coal per worker per year
to 2,500 in five years' time.
The study says that recoverable deep mine reserves in all 50 pits would last
21 years.
The nine pits from the 21 earmarked for possible closure but identified by
Oakes as internationally competitive are Maltby, Hatfield, Prince of Wales,
Rossington, Bentley, Point of Ayr, Wearmouth, Clipstone and Silverdale
The report says British Coal's most modern pit, Asfordby in Leicestershire,
is a good candidate for mothballing because it is unlikely to have lower
operating costs than the corporation's best mines.

REPRESENTATIVES of English local authorities including London and the six
metropolitan areas have warned Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment
secretary, that they may stop participating in Youth Training.
Since 1988, local authorities have been among the main providers of places
on the scheme, the main training programme for 16 to 19-year-olds, often
heavily subsidising them. Now they say the recession and government curbs on
spending will force them to curtail the scheme.
They believe the recession has invalidated many of the assumptions behind
YT.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Taxpayers 'lost out' in sell-off
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXPAYERS and consumers lost out to investors in the privatisation of the
electricity industry in 1990, the all-party Commons public accounts
committee said yesterday.
Its report said the Pounds 16.7bn assets owned by the 12 regional
electricity companies were sold for proceeds of Pounds 7.7bn. That sum
consisted of Pounds 4.9bn paid by investors for shares with the remaining
Pounds 2.8bn in the form of debt repayable to the government.
The committee said the cost of servicing that debt was essentially borne by
the electricity consumer through higher electricity bills.
The committee attacked the sharp rise in profits reported by electricity
companies since privatisation, and the strong growth in dividends.
It commented that it would 'not have been unreasonable' for the taxpayer to
share in the growth in profits. Manweb results, Page 24

FT  10 DEC 92 / Recovery day fails to strike a blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY's National Day of Recovery, organised by the Trades Union Congress
to link the campaign against pit closures to job losses in general, will be
remembered for a long time at George Fischer Castings in Bedford.
On the day when union representatives around Britain were supposed to be
asking their employers to think of alternatives to redundancy, Fischer told
300 of its 350 workers that their jobs were being transferred to Germany and
Austria.
Mr Mike Pennington, managing director of the Swiss-owned malleable-fittings
maker, said he had not heard of the National Day of Recovery and admitted
that the job losses had 'come as a shock' to most of the workers and their
union.
Since the slump in industrial and commercial construction in the UK, Fischer
has been exporting most of its UK output. But as the German market weakens
as well, customers can be better served from Continental plants.
Overall, the Day of Recovery saw little union activity on jobs. Most big
employers, such as ICI and Unilever, said they had had no formal approach
from unions at national or plant level. There was a demonstration in
Manchester, and a service for recovery at Southwark Cathedral in London
attended by 350 people.
At the TUC's own day-long conference in London the limelight was stolen by
Mr Arthur Scargill, the National Union of Mineworkers president. He reverted
to the militant rhetoric that has been notably absent in recent weeks when
he called for 'a day of action with millions taking part' if the government
did not keep open all 31 pits under review.
His comments were immediately criticised by Mr Bill Jordan, president of the
AEEU craft union, who said they were a throwback to formulas that have never
worked.
The European dimension did at least come to the TUC's rescue. Mr Norman
Willis, TUC general secretary and president of the European Trade Union
Confederation, led a joint European union and employers' delegation to urge
a growth strategy on Mr John Major, the prime minister, for the Edinburgh
summit.
The European unions and employers claim some credit for putting the idea on
the agenda at Edinburgh, and Mr Major said a European Commission plan for
infrastructure investment would be married to UK ideas for improving labour
market flexibility.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Companies face tougher rules on defining shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES will be required to comply with much tougher definitions of
capital instruments in their accounts under a draft financial reporting
standard issued yesterday.
The third financial reporting exposure draft (Fred 3) issued by the
Accounting Standards Board demands more consistent treatment, adequate
disclosure and a true reflection of the costs of capital instruments such as
shares, debentures and loans.
The draft is likely to become a mandatory standard by late next year. Among
the most radical proposals is that convertible debt should be separately
disclosed and included in liabilities until it is actually converted into
equity.
Mr David Tweedie, board chairman, said: 'The main problem with capital
instruments was the diversity of treatment.
'Neither the profit-and-loss account nor balance sheet were comparable. This
will make them comparable.'
Capital instruments will be classified as liabilities if they contain an
obligation to transfer cash or other resources. Liabilities will be split
between convertible and non-convertible instruments.
Shareholders' funds will appear in accounts divided between equity and
non-equity interests. Non-equity will include any shares that have a
restricted right to dividends or are redeemable.
Minority interests will appear between equity interests in subsidiaries and
non-equity interests in subsidiaries. The finance costs of liabilities -
such as interest costs, dividends or premiums payable on redemption - should
be allocated to accounting periods to achieve a constant rate on the amount
outstanding.
The board said the discussion draft on capital instruments issued a year ago
was favourably received. Changes as a result of comments include a
redefinition of short and long-term debt. Short-term borrowings will be
permitted to be reported as long-term if they are under a long-term
financing facility. Short-term commercial paper cannot be reported as
long-term.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Richard Tompkins: founder of the Argos stores chain -
Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHARD TOMPKINS, the man behind the Green Shield stamps phenomenon of the
1960s and 1970s and founder of the Argos catalogue shops, has died aged 74.
Tompkins started his working life in a north London laundry, and then worked
as a petrol pump attendant and as a racing tipster. He spotted the appeal of
trading stamps on a visit to the US, brought the idea back to Britain and
set up in business in 1958.
Green Shield, a trade name bought for Pounds 50 from a luggage company, was
a big success and made Tompkins a multimillionaire.
In Green Shield's heyday from the late 1960s to the mid 1970s its annual
turnover was more than Pounds 50m and 36,000 stores and garages traded with
it. Stamp-licking became part of the shopping routine and queues formed at
redemption centres where books of stamps were traded for a range of goods.
The idea was dealt a blow in 1977 when the Tesco food chain, one of Green
Shield's main customers for 14 years, dropped the stamps in favour of price
cuts.
There was a battle to save the idea, with offers of treble and quadruple
stamps to attract customers, but inflation was rampant and shoppers prefered
lower prices. The exchange of Green Shield stamps for goods ended in 1980.
Tompkins had moved into catalogue sales and had launched the Argos chain in
1973. The chain was sold to the tobacco group BAT Industries in 1979 for
Pounds 32m, largely because of Tompkins' ill-health.
In 1986 he relaunched Green Shield with a lavish marketing campaign designed
to attract younger shoppers. More than 2,500 shops were signed up, but no
big supermarket chains joined the scheme and the venture was wound down in
August last year.
Tompkins, who died on Sunday, is survived by his second wife, Elizabeth, and
three daughters.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Renewed hope for coal pushes fears offshore: Neil Buckley
outlines the perils of reversing the 'dash for gas'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GAS-FIRED power stations have been widely blamed for the possible demise of
a large part of the UK coal industry. Now the government is being warned
that any attempt to reverse the 'dash for gas' could inflict serious damage
on a mainstay of the UK economy - the offshore oil and gas industry.
The economics of five significant North Sea gas developments depend largely
on contracts with gas-fired stations. Gas supplies from three more fields
have been bought by British Gas to meet higher demand caused by the 'dash
for gas'.
Oil industry experts warn that, if any of these projects ceases or is
damaged, producers may take future investment elsewhere.
Modern combined-cycle gas turbine stations are efficient and emit only half
the carbon dioxide of coal-fired plant, less than a quarter of the nitrogen
oxides and virtually no sulphur dioxide.
They are cheap and quick to build - which is why they were so attractive to
regional electricity companies in England and Wales seeking to diversify
their sources of power after the electricity industry was privatised in
1990. The power industry's enthusiasm for gas coincided with the emergence
of independent gas marketers competing with the privatised British Gas.
Criticism of the combined-cycle stations has centred on three allegations.
The first is that gas-fired power costs more than coal-fired, though this is
likely to be blunted by today's report from Professor Stephen Littlechild,
the electricity regulator, that gas supply contracts are not uneconomic.
Most comparisons suggest that gas-fired power, including capital costs, is
more expensive than existing coal-fired plant. But gas-fired power is
generally less expensive when the costs of fitting desulphurisation
equipment to coal-fired plants are taken into account. Such measures would
be unavoidable to meet European Community emissions standards if coal
maintained its share of generation.
There are two categories of combined-cycle station. Five of the 16 stations
given the green light will have to be economic to survive. They are owned by
the big two generators and will sell their electricity into the 'pool', the
competitive section of the market.
'If we have got it wrong it will be PowerGen and our shareholders who take
the hit,' PowerGen said. 'But we are pretty confident we have got it right.'
The other 11 gas-fired plants are independent projects that have signed
long-term contracts with regional electricity companies involving an agreed
price. If that is higher than the pool price, the companies are allowed to
pass on the cost to their customers, although Prof Littlechild has said he
may review this.
Suspicion centres on later projects that signed contracts after gas prices
began rising because of heavy demand - especially four receiving gas under
the costlier of British Gas's two price schedules.
A second criticism is that the new plants will lead to much over-capacity.
To avoid over-capacity, some plants will have to be retired - but this was
envisaged at the time of privatisation. The government's white paper
estimated that 13,000MW of new capacity would be required by the year 2000
to replace ageing plants - 70 per cent are more than 15 years old.
The total capacity of likely gas-fired projects is only 10,000MW, with a
further 4,000MW awaiting government consents that may not be granted - while
the Sizewell B nuclear station will provide 1,200MW from 1994.
Finally, critics say UK gas reserves are smaller than claimed, and prices
could rise. Estimates from British Gas and other sources say there are only
21 years of proven, probable and possible reserves at the higher levels of
demand caused by the rise in gas-fired generation. But experience in the
North Sea and elsewhere shows such estimates are constantly increasing.
Even if the criticisms are true, the government has four options:
To try to stop the combined-cycle stations. Oil companies and independent
consultants warn that this could jeopardise Pounds 6bn of investment in the
North Sea along with investor confidence and thousands of jobs. Allow the
stations to go ahead. Without compensatory action 31 pits would close, as
originally envisaged.
Allow the stations to go ahead, but limit their market. Mr John Baker, chief
executive of National Power, has suggested that the stations should be
forced to sell their electricity only into the non-franchise market that
supplies large customers and in which British Coal cannot compete.
That would leave more room for coal in the franchise market that supplies
households and smaller businesses. British Coal could increase sales to the
generators by up to 20m tonnes a year. Customers of regional companies would
bear the additional costs.
The problem is that many combined-cycle stations are being built
specifically to serve the franchise market on long-term contracts, and
secured financing only on that basis. One project involves 23 banks. The
legal difficulties of re-writing the contracts would be immense - one gas
marketer described the idea as 'crazy'.
Subsidise coal to enable it to compete with gas. That would hit some of the
gas-fired stations, with some of the knock-on effects detailed above.
Many gas and coal experts say the government should look not at gas plants,
but at the heavily subsidised nuclear industry, especially ageing Magnox
reactors.
They are also urging the government to keep closed pits under care and
maintenance, so they can be reopened.
Combined-cycle stations could yet provide a new lease of life for British
coal - they can burn a variety of fuels, including gas made from coal.
Coal gasification technology may not be economic now, but could be within a
decade.
'The choice for the government,' said one gas consultant, 'is do we accept
that we are here now, and we have to go on from here, causing the least
possible damage to the energy market as a whole, or do we try to turn back
the clock and make an even bigger mess than we already have?'

FT  10 DEC 92 / Goya bullfight reaches record Pounds 4.95m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCENE at a bullfight, painted by Goya when he was 78, sold for Pounds
4.95m at Sotheby's in London yesterday to the Getty Museum of Malibu,
California. The price, an auction record for Goya, was within the saleroom's
estimate.
Goya painted the scene from memory in 1824 while an exile in Paris for his
friend Joaquin Ferrer and it has remained in the Ferrer family. Important
paintings by Goya rarely appear on the market, and that accounts for the
price.
The auction of Old Master pictures totalled Pounds 9.4m and was 27.6 per
cent unsold by value. But bidding was selective and 39 of the 85 lots in the
morning session were bought in, including works by Murillo and Cranach the
Elder and a portrait attributed to Durer. The main casualty was a Venetian
scene by Canaletto for which bidding stopped at Pounds 650,000, well below
the high estimate of Pounds 1.5m.
A view of Amsterdam painted by Philips de Koninck in the 1640s went to a
German dealer for Pounds 990,000, a record for the artist but below its
forecast. It was sold by the trustees of the estate of the late Earl
Mountbatten. Another artist record was the Pounds 335,000 paid for a scene
at a Venetian masked ball painted by Giovanni Antonio Guardi, brother of the
more famous Francesco Guardi.
'A Hawking Party on a Hilly Landscape' by Philips Wouwermans, estimated at
up to Pounds 70,000, sold for Pounds 253,000, and 'Three Figures at a Table'
by a follower of Caravaggio made Pounds 115,500 against a Pounds 30,000 top
estimate.
One of the most important antiquities to appear at Christie's for many
years, a red painted limestone statue of per-Neb, a temple inspector of 5th
Dynasty Egypt (2360 BC), was unsold yesterday even though its estimate of
Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 800,000 was reduced substantially before the
auction.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Account standards extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES WILL be required to apply new accounting standards to all
significant transactions regardless of when they took place, the Accounting
Standards Board ruled yesterday.
In a wide-ranging statement with important implications for covenants and
other legal documents, the board stressed that any transactions that took
place before a standard was introduced must comply with the new standard.
Companies have claimed that adjustments to new standards could mean they
breach contracts and agreements that specify limits on items such as net
worth or gearing.
But the board - with support from the British Banking Association - said
this should be considered when contracts are drawn up, and renegotiated if
necessary after new standards are introduced.
Contracts will use the standards at the time of signing - so-called 'frozen
GAAP' or generally accepted accounting principles.
Mr David Tweedie, board chairman, said: 'This brings everyone on to a
comparable basis. You must make sure covenants deal with accounting
standards at the time of signing. We want to show it as it is.'
The board argued that the exemption of certain transactions meant they were
accounted for in different ways in the same set of accounts, and hindered
comparisons.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Targets set for Post Office 'unreasonable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is imposing 'unreasonable and uncommercial' financial targets
on the Post Office, the Post Office Users' National Council, the official
postal services watchdog, said yesterday.
Over the next two financial years the Post Office's contribution to the
government will rise by more than Pounds 200m.
The amount the Post Office has to generate from cashflow above its own
investment needs - negative external financing limits (EFLs) - will increase
from Pounds 68m in 1993-94 and Pounds 70m in 1994-95 to Pounds 180m in both
years.
In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Tom
Corrigan, chairman of the council, said he was 'appalled to find that
without prior mention or justification future Post Office negative external
financing limits have been increased by over 250 per cent'.
Given the recent Post Office pay settlement at twice the 1.5 per cent public
sector rate announced by the government, Mr Corrigan fears the Post Office
will have to find the extra cash by reducing services and investment and
increasing prices. Wages and salaries account for about four fifths of the
Post Office's costs.
The watchdog predicts that there will be 'little or no improvement in postal
quality', warning of significant increases in stamp prices in order to meet
the 'tax on the post'. Mr Corrigan said: 'The arbitrary nature of the
negative EFL target appears unreasonable and uncommercial'.
Earlier in the year the group issued a report on Post Office financial
targets. 'We hoped this would act as a catalyst for debate but regrettably
so far has elicited no response from the government,' Mr Corrigan said.
The Post Office described the targets as 'challenging', but said its record
showed it could meet government targets.
The Department of Trade and Industry said that since there was pressure on
the public sector borrowing requirement 'it is reasonable that the
government should look for a higher rate of return from the Post Office'.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Ford defends car price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, yesterday rounded on critics
of the company's latest increases in car prices and claimed that many of the
comments were 'ill-judged'.
Earlier this week Ford announced average price rises from January 4 for its
Fiesta and Escort/Orion cars of 4.5 per cent and for its Sierra and Granada
cars of 7.5 per cent.
Mr McAllister claimed that retail prices of the Fiesta small car range,
excluding car tax, would be only 1.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent higher in
January than at the beginning of this year. Ford had lowered list prices for
the Fiesta twice this year as part of 'aggressive action to stimulate
sales'.
The price of the 1.4 litre Escort CAT LX after the increase would be 7.6 per
cent higher than in January this year. During the year it had significantly
improved the Escort range with the addition of new engines, catalytic
converters as standard equipment and improved safety features.
Mr McAllister claimed that no manufacturer could ignore the impact of the
devaluation of the pound by around 16 per cent and inflation of 4 per cent,
but said that Ford had 'increased prices over the past year by far less'.
However, the Escort/Orion and Fiesta ranges are built in the UK and are
largely shielded from the impact of devaluation. The prices of the
German-built Granada and the Belgian-built Sierra will have risen by around
13 per cent in the 12 months to January.
Mr McAllister said that it was 'absurd' to claim that Britain was a 'high
price, high profit' market given the decline in the profitability of UK
manufacturers and the severity of the recession.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Government may curb spread of GPs' companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering action to halt the spread of private companies
being set up by GP fundholders under National Health Service reforms.
Fundholders are general practitioners who purchase hospital and other care
on behalf of their patients from government-allocated budgets.
The introduction of fundholding last year has led to some fundholders
providing extra services as well as purchasing them. Some bring specialists
to their surgeries to carry out consultations and treatment that would
normally involve patients going to hospital.
Some fundholders have set up private companies to handle the financial
arrangements for these activities, which fall outside the normal scope of
GPs' remuneration.
The government's concern about this activity emerged at yesterday's
conference of the National Association of Fundholding Practices in
Birmingham. Mr Bill McCarthy, a Department of Health official responsible
for fundholding issues, said there were 'real concerns about accountability'
involved in the use of private companies. He said ministers were looking for
alternative arrangements to make their use unnecessary.
The attempt to restrain the use of private companies by NHS doctors
coincides with government moves to persuade fundholders, who made windfall
surpluses on their budgets during the first year of the scheme, to repay
them.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, who addressed the conference
earlier yesterday, said there were 'quite a few cases where very high
savings were clearly due to the wrong budgets set in the first place'.
Fundholders must 'place long-term achievements above short-term gain'.
She said the responsible approach would be to agree to return any savings
that were due to incorrect budget settings rather than their own efficiency.
Some fundholders have returned money that arose from inaccurate
budget-settings when the scheme was launched.
But regional health authorities have no legal right to demand it back, and
some GPs say they intend to use surpluses for developments such as
improvements to surgery premises.
Mrs Bottomley described fundholding as an 'innovative and dynamic scheme'
that would remain a permanent cornerstone of the NHS.
She stressed that fundholders must demonstrate accountability and
responsibility.
In addition to financial concerns, ministers are grappling with the problem
of ensuring that fundholders spend their budgets in ways that accord with
the government's overall health priorities.
Mrs Bottomley said the challenge was to ensure that fundholders' plans were
consistent with national priorities 'without sacrificing innovation and
change'.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Family company mirrors plight of machine tool sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX MONTHS after the collapse of Beaver Engineering Group focused attention
on the plight of the machine tool industry, 10 designers are almost all that
remains of what was once the sector's largest family-owned company.
Beaver's service and design activities were bought in October by Mikron, the
leading Swiss milling machine producer, in a move that received little
attention beyond the industry and Beaver's home base of Norwich.
The sale was negotiated by Cork Gully, the administrative receivers, and the
terms have not been disclosed. A design team led by Mr Tony Jackson, former
Beaver technical director, will continue designing machining centres -
multi-functional machine tools - at Norwich.
Marketing, service and spare parts activities have been transferred to
Mikron's Birmingham subsidiary, and manufacturing of Beaver machining
centres is being switched to Mikron's plant at Biel in Switzerland, where
there is spare capacity.
When Mikron acquired Beaver the receivers had already cut the workforce by
80 to between 50 and 60. Mr Tony Balding, former managing director and son
of the company's founder, was made redundant in July and has mixed feelings
about the sale.
'If you look at what Beaver was - at one point we had 290 employees - it
does not seem that much has been saved,' he said. 'But Beaver's innovative
capability, or part of it at least, has been retained, and one must hope
that it will be nurtured.'
Beaver, founded in 1951, was one of the most technologically innovative UK
machine tool makers. After expanding in the boom conditions of the late
1980s, it struggled to survive in the recession and foundered when its bank
withdrew support. Mikron was immediately suggested as a possible buyer - the
two companies signed a marketing agreement in the late 1980s and earlier
this year unveiled their first jointly developed machining centre,
This is one of two Beaver machining centres which will be manufactured by
Mikron. The Beaver name will disappear, but Mr Ralph Schmitz-Drager, Mikron
finance director, indicated it might be revived if the Swiss company
developed some of Beaver's other machine tools, such as lathes.
Mr Schmitz-Drager said the prospects for the Beaver machining centres were
good.
The design team is looking for a new 5,000 sq ft office in Norwich - the
current factory is 100,000 sq ft. Mr Balding has set up his own consultancy,
APB Enterprises, and is looking for opportunities to 'keep the wolf from the
door'.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDS-SCICON, the computing services company, is planning to make more than
250 people, or 6 per cent of its workforce, redundant following a review of
staffing levels.
It will be one of the largest job-shedding exercises in the computing
services sector and reinforces the view in the information technology
industries that only a weak economic recovery can be expected next year.
Mr Tom Butler, the new managing director, said that on expected levels of
business there were 380 jobs too many in the organisation and only 100
vacancies to be filled.
The workforce was told yesterday that the redundancies would be announced
after a 30-day consultation period. Mr Butler said the redundancies would
involve managers and administrative staff as well as technicians and sales
personnel.
EDS-Scicon was formed by the merger last year between the UK operations of
EDS, a General Motors subsidiary and one of the world's largest computing
services companies, and SD-Scicon. Mr Butler said the redundancies would
involve staff from both sides of the merged company.
The company has substantial expertise in facilities management - running
other companies' computers on a contractual basis. It is expected to be a
prime contender to win contracts under the 'market testing' programme
announced last month by the government.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Charities given lottery pledge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFEGUARDS will be built into the national lottery to protect charities'
fundraising projects, the government said yesterday.
Mr Robert Key, national heritage minister, said the government had explored
ways of ensuring that charities did not suffer indirectly as a result of the
planned lottery.
These included relaxing laws on small charitable lotteries to make them more
attractive, and the sensitive marketing of the lottery - which would deliver
'tremendous benefits' to charities nationwide.
Charities have warned that their income may drop because of the lottery,
which will have a weekly jackpot of Pounds 1m.
At the same time they feared suffering if lottery adverts focused on other
individual charities as the latest 'good cause'.
Mr Key said the charities' concerns had been taken on board in drafting the
Lottery Bill, and he told the National Council for Voluntary Organisations
that there would be a separate mechanism for distributing lottery money to
charities.
He said: 'The onus will be on getting the product right - not on exploiting
this month's good cause.'
Art treasures could be loaned to regional museums if the government
allocated a Pounds 1m annual grant, Sir David Wilson, former director of the
British Museum, said.
He said requests for temporary collections were becoming more frequent, but
the costs of security, transport and care often made lending impossible.
In an open letter to Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, Sir David suggests
that if regional venues 'were allowed an annual sum of Pounds 1m, they would
be able to provide access to treasures housed in national museums on a scale
never previously realised'.

<TEXT>
SENATOR Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate trade subcommittee, called on the
Bush administration yesterday to halt the Uruguay Round of trade talks
'until the Clinton team is fully consulted and has input on the
negotiations'.
The senator, who has advised President-elect Bill Clinton on other trade
matters, said that, because the recently concluded US-EC oilseeds agreement
was 'almost meaningless', he had 'no faith in the ability and willingness'
of the Bush administration to conclude agreements in other areas.
Mr Clinton has indicated his support for continued negotiations by the Bush
administration.
But his supporters are divided on the issue of trade, between those who want
to see the Uruguay Round finished swiftly and those who want Mr Clinton to
take office and make significant changes in a compromise text introduced by
Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt, which is now the basis for
negotiation.
Senator Baucus said the text was not acceptable to Congress as it endangered
domestic trade laws, 'does little' on intellectual property rights, and
'potentially exposes US environmental laws to unwarranted challenge'.

FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Swiss No to closer ties leaves Efta
picking up the pieces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE resounding Swiss No to the European Economic Area, the free trade zone
linking the EC's 12 members with the seven countries of the European Free
Trade Association, has left Efta facing every which way. The association,
which holds its regular autumn meeting in Geneva today and tomorrow, has the
task of sorting out how the EEA can be realised without Switzerland, and
agreeing a common approach to the European Community.
In the longer term the Swiss decision has injected more uncertainty into the
debate over Efta's long-term future and its relationship with third
countries, especially in central and eastern Europe.
The EEA, which was due to come into force on January 1, is certain to be
delayed by a few months - or more, if Swiss withdrawal entails renegotiation
of the accord's terms.
Switzerland, as Efta's richest member, was due to pay the most - SFr350m
(Pounds 160.5m) over five years - into an Efta cohesion fund for the benefit
of poorer EC regions. Simply deducting the Swiss contribution could provoke
demands by Spain and other southern European states for a compensating
concession elsewhere in the EEA agreement.
To maintain the fund would mean higher contributions by Austria, Finland,
Iceland, Norway and Sweden, the remaining members, assuming Liechtenstein
follows Switzerland in voting No this weekend. Alternatively, Switzerland
could pay its contribution anyway, in the hope of persuading the EC to look
kindly on individual bilateral deals that will ease Swiss trade with the EEA
area.
Mr Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the Swiss trade and economy minister, will come
under pressure at the meeting to indicate Swiss intentions. Embarrassingly,
Switzerland is due to assume the rotating Efta presidency for the first half
of 1993.
There could also be problems in financing the new competition body and court
of justice Efta is setting up to administer its side of the EEA treaty,
which will double Efta's annual budget to about SFr100m.
The Swiss government has not yet made up its mind whether to press ahead
with its application to join the EC - alongside Austria, Finland, Norway and
Sweden. However, the most likely prospect two or three years from now is for
a shrunken Efta comprising Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, with only
Iceland in need of Efta's EEA superstructure.
That is unless they invite central and eastern European countries to join
them. These nations could see Efta as a convenient vehicle for EEA entry and
a means to accelerate eventual EC membership.
Efta has set up links of varying closeness with several states in the
region, largely paralleling accords these countries have with the EC.
Efta ministers will today sign agreements on free trade in industrial and
processed agricultural goods with Poland and Romania and a declaration of
co-operation with Albania. The association's free trade accord with the
Czech and Slovak Republics came into force in July.

FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: European chemicals have 'last chance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S petrochemical industry has one last chance to rationalise itself to
avoid a disorderly and disastrous restructuring during the next down-cycle,
Mr Michael Bennett, a director at the consultants Arthur D. Little, warned
yesterday.
He said at the FT's petrochemical conference in London that the European
industry had to rationalise to make itself globally competitive.
The main threat to European producers remains Asian output, which is set to
increase rapidly. Mr Mohammed Al-Kathiri, general manager of Sabic Marketing
in Europe, said that by the year 2000 34 per cent of petrochemical demand
would be in the Asia-Pacific region, 28 per cent in western Europe and 24
per cent in the US.
Mr Pramote Chaiyavech, technical director of Thailand's National
Petrochemical Corp, who called on European companies to invest in the
region, predicted annual south-east Asian ethylene production would increase
from 915,000 tonnes a year in 1992 to 2.4bn by the end of the decade. The
region has benefited from advantageous gas feed stocks.
North-east Asian capacity was expanding faster than regional demand, but
might be saved by rapid growth in China, the region's largest potential
market, Mr Al-Kathiri said. This could suck in capacity from Korea and the
Middle East.
New 'star' petrochemical products included methyl tertiary butyl ether
(MTBE) and PTA, said Mr Reynaldo Ortiz, petrochemical division manager at
International Finance Corp. He warned that markets for other overnight
wonders had quickly suffered from overcapacity.
Public trust in the industry had fallen steeply over the past decade, warned
Mr James Lindhelm, chairman of Burson-Marsteller Europe. The industry had to
improve its environmental performance.

FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japan waves anti-dumping stick at China
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has warned that anti-dumping duties may be imposed on Chinese
exporters of ferrosilicon manganese, used by the steel industry, unless they
increase prices alleged to be unfairly low.
Officials at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry denied
local newspaper reports that a decision had already been made to apply
duties of between 5 and 26 per cent, which would be the first anti-dumping
penalties imposed by Japan.
However, Japanese investigators have warned Chinese export corporations that
there is evidence of unfair pricing policies which have caused damage to
Japanese producers, and that further information will be sought before a
final decision. China's share of the Japanese market has risen from about 17
per cent in 1989 to 39 per cent.
Reports of the anti-dumping case are embarrassing for Japan, which has taken
a leading role in international negotiations on the anti-dumping issue. It
recently produced a discussion paper which concluded that a series of
European cases against Japanese producers were unfairly conducted.
The case highlights increasing trade tensions between Japan and China, whose
exporters are penetrating a range of markets, prompting complaints from
local producers. Japanese textile companies also complain that Chinese
factories are using predatory pricing policies to gain market share.
An investigation was made of ferrosilicon manganese producers in South
Africa and Norway, but it is believed that both countries will be cleared of
dumping. Japanese officials were required to prove unfair pricing and that
domestic producers suffered as a result of that pricing.
In the past, Japan had threatened to impose anti-dumping duties on South
Korean knitwear exporters, but these companies reluctantly agreed to
'voluntary restraints' before the duties were formally imposed, and Tokyo is
hoping that a similar agreement will be reached with the Chinese producers.
About seven Chinese state-run companies are alleged to price exports at far
below levels offered on the domestic market, but the companies insist they
are doing nothing wrong. Miti officials said they were gathering further
information from the companies, and negotiations would continue into the New
Year.

The Moscow office will be opened on Tuesday. The last of the four, in
Budapest, will be opened early next year.
Microsoft, which had worldwide revenues of Dollars 2.98bn (Pounds 1.96bn)
last year, including more than Dollars 1bn worth of sales in western Europe,
has been operating in eastern Europe for some years, chiefly through agents.
Mr Bernard Vergnes, president of Microsoft Europe, said sales in each of the

are opened, we expect to double or triple sales rapidly'.
The company is adopting a special pricing policy to deal with software
piracy. Prices in east Europe will be similar to those in the US; prices in
the rest of Europe are higher, reflecting costs of conducting business
across the continent.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Fuel for the fire in Moslem hearts: Stefan Wagstyl on
frustrations ignited by the assault on Ayodhya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYED Abdullah Bukhari, the imam of Delhi's largest mosque and the
white-bearded patriarch of India's Moslems, sympathises with those Moslems
who have taken to the streets in violent protest throughout India in
reaction to the assault on the mosque in Ayodhya.
'They have fire in their chests,' he said yesterday. 'The destruction of a
mosque is like killing a human being. They are right to be angry.'
The imam also approved of the actions of his 40-year-old son and potential
successor, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, who had just been arrested for the second
time in two days for trying to lead a protest march to the prime minister's
home in defiance of a police curfew.
Ayodhya has stirred the passions of Indian Moslems more than anything since
hundreds of thousands of people died in the riots which accompanied
partition in 1947. At least 700 people have died since the mosque was
destroyed on Sunday - most of them Moslems killed by police fire.
Moslems are angry not just with the Hindu militants who pulled down the 16th
century shrine but with the government for allowing the destruction to
happen. 'This is the greatest disaster India's Moslems have faced,' says Mr
Ebrahim Suleiman Sait, president of the India Union Moslem League, the
leading Moslem political organisation.
Anger is one thing. Action is another. Moslems have taken to the streets in
the past - as recently as two years ago a partial assault on the Ayodhya
mosque also prompted nationwide riots. But violence has rarely brought
India's Moslems any benefits because it has rarely been followed by any
concrete political action. For a community of 120m people, some 13 per cent
of the population, India's Moslems have been singularly unable to assert
themselves.
Mr M J Akbar, a leading Moslem journalist and a former MP, says he would
like to think that Ayodhya might be a big enough shock to provoke Moslems
into sustained political action. But he doubts it. 'India's Moslems have a
ghetto mentality.'
It is not hard to find the causes of Moslems' political failure or their
frustration. Hardly any large enterprises are in Moslem hands. Moslems
account for less than 2 per cent of those passing senior civil service exams
and only about 2 per cent of bank executives. Moslem literacy rates are
officially estimated to be around 42 per cent, against a national figure of
52 per cent, though some Moslem educationalists put the Moslem figure as low
as 25 per cent.
Moreover, burdened by poverty and ignorance, Moslems have been unable to
resolve their basic dilemma - how far they want to compete in mainstream
Indian life and how much they want to assert a separate identity.
Many Moslems believe the roots of their weaknesses go back to the partition
when the cream of India's Moslems fled to Pakistan, including most of the
political leadership. Those who stayed behind learnt through the bloody
partition riots to keep their heads down.
Moslems claim they suffer discrimination from the Hindu majority, in
particular in schools and at work. But they also acknowledge that they are
themselves partly to blame for what is probably their biggest weakness - the
lack of education. Moslem clerics have been slow to promote schooling,
except for Islamic studies, and especially for girls.
In the large cities, life is slowly changing for those Moslems who have been
able to secure middle-class jobs. Some have managed to get rich by working
in the Gulf states on contracts. They and their children are able to enter
mainstream Indian life - sometimes to the disgust of more traditional
Moslems.
But for the majority, poverty is the rule. As Mr Akbar says: 'The
fundamental problem is the lack a strong Moslem middle class.'
Without such a force, Moslems' role in politics will necessarily be limited.
Until the late 1970s, Moslems generally supported the ruling Congress (I)
party, mainly because it was in power. Moslems were guaranteed some
important privileges - such as the right to enforce Moslem family law.
However, in the 1980s, Moslems drifted in increasing disillusionment to
middle-of-the-road secularist parties, such as Janata Dal.
This helped to open the way for the militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party,
which spearheaded the movement against the Ayodhya mosque. The BJP won a
string of electoral successes in the late 1980s.
Until last weekend, Moslems were steadily drifting back to Congress (I).
Whether their anger at the government's failure to prevent the mosque's
destruction will overcome their fear of further BJP gains is hard to say.
Either way, Moslems will be unable to assert themselves at the ballot box.
So it is scarcely surprising that their young men riot in the streets. And
that even as moderate a man as Syed Abdullah Bukhari refuses to condemn
them.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian cabinet yesterday approved despatch of 2,500 servicemen to
Somalia at the request of the UN and US, with 1,200 troops to support UN
humanitarian operations in Mozambique, Robert Graham reports from Rome.
Most of the contingent will arrive in Somalia by boat and should be fully
operational by January 4. The US is said to have sought Italy's military
presence given its colonial links with Somalia and knowledge of the factions
in the civil war. Rome is keen to prove its international role and
leadership of Nato's southern flank rapid intervention force.
Steven Butler reports from Tokyo: Japan is considering whether to contribute
financially to UN-backed relief efforts in Somalia, Mr Koichi Kato, chief
cabinet secretary, said yesterday.
His comments were the strongest indication yet that Japan would back the
effort, although Tokyo may still be vulnerable to criticism that its
response was late and inadequate. Its slow reaction is thought to have
damaged its chances of becoming a permanent member of the UN Security
Council.
It was still too early to discuss the size of a Japanese contribution, Mr
Kato added, but Japan faced no constitutional barriers to supporting this
humanitarian effort. Tokyo might provide medical aid and refugee relief, and
would consider sending personnel. There would be little public support for
Japan's sending troops to Somalia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A convoy of 22 armoured personnel carriers and anti-tank vehicles, more
than 200 Marines weighted down with weaponry and dressed in desert fatigues
yesterday made a full-scale assault on the wreckage of the former US Embassy
compound.
Cobra helicopter gunships hovered overhead as the nervous Marines fanned out
across the vast Embassy grounds and advanced on the vandalised buildings.
US soldiers two years ago had to pluck US diplomats and foreigners from the
rooftop to safety as Somalia slipped into anarchy and the US turned its back
on its former cold war satellite.
On that occasion the Marines faced gunfire, tracer bullets and anti-aircraft
flak. Yesterday the only obstacles were cows and goats grazing on the
overgrown garden littered with the rusting innards of computers, fax
machines and filing cabinets - the debris of repeated looting.
At the airport yesterday Marines searched buildings, shouted orders in
English at sleeping workers in an airport hangar and forced them to lie face
down with their hands spread out on the tarmac. One worker had his left arm
in the air bent at right-angles. For several minutes US soldiers shouted at
him until a fellow worker explained in broken English that the man's arm was
broken.
At the port helicopters fired tracer bullets over reporters and port workers
as soaked Marines arrived. The US later claimed they had been fired at
first. 'They started firing at us on three different occasions. We returned
fire,' Captain David Clement, 33, whose Fox company from the Ninth Marines
Regiment landed in 18 Zodiac inflatable dinghies.
Somali drivers and guards were arrested and had their hands tied behind
their backs with plastic handcuffs. Their guns, used to protect their
vehicles from bandits, were temporarily confiscated.
The Marines were clearly confused and many said they were scared. They
dropped boxes of ammunition and other equipment in the first hour of the
operation to secure the port, a hub of the relief effort.
Later, bandits known as moriyan fired on a vehicle belonging to an aid
agency injuring two men. The men's colleagues later blamed the Americans,
who they said had confiscated 12 of their guns.
Col Fred Peck, the Marine spokesman, yesterday defended the strong-arm
tactics. 'We did it to make a point,' he said. 'We are here and we are here
for serious business.' Many of the senior Marine officers, like Col Peck,
are well acquainted with Somalia's problems but it was clear yesterday that
most Marines have a poor understanding of Somalia. 'We didn't know you have
to move around the city with gunmen,' one soldier said.
While yesterday's lightning operation passed off remarkably successfully,
and crowds welcomed the Americans they see as their deliverers, Somalis say
the US should proceed sensitively in the coming days. Negotiations with
local warlords, so far ignored, will have to proceed smoothly.
The experience of the Marines in Lebanon a decade ago ought to provide a
cautionary tale.
When they first landed in Beirut they were greeted with euphoria as saviours
from the warlords and rival militias. As soon as they got bogged in Lebanese
politics that euphoria quickly turned to hostility, and 241 Marines returned
home in body bags before they evacuated the city. Somalia is not Lebanon.
The rival clan-militias are not as heavily armed or motivated. But there are
parallels. Even the US flag raised over the embassy yesterday was the same
one that flew over the Marine barracks in Beirut.

connection with press reports earlier this year concerning the country's
economic performance, Kieran Cooke writes.
On June 29 Singapore's Business Times newspaper published preliminary
estimates of second quarter growth figures, saying it would be about 4.6-4.8
per cent. The government said the report was based on leaked information and
the internal security department launched an investigation.
Mr Patrick Daniel, the Busines Times editor, is among those charged under
the provisions of Singapore's official secrets act. Also charged are a
senior official at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and two economists
working for Crosby's Securities.
The four were released on bail of SDollars 5,000 (Pounds 1,900) each.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Act on racism, Rabin urges EC

<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday urged the European
Community to take more effective action against racist and anti-Semitic
attacks across Europe, Sheila Jones writes.
Mr Rabin raised the issue in talks with Mr John Major, the British premier,
yesterday, during a three-day visit to the UK. The Israeli premier asked Mr
Major, in his role as EC president, to press for an EC-wide policy to be
mapped out at the Edinburgh summit this weekend.
EC officials have also pressed for EC Community action on racial violence in
Europe, although the issue is not formally on the summit agenda. Mr Rabin
said in Italy on Sunday that the rise of racial violence and anti-Semitism
in Europe had rekindled memories of the Nazi holocaust.

FT  10 DEC 92 / 'Earth matters' taking a back seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENVIRONMENT is 'taking a back seat to the global recession,' Dr Mustapha
Tolba, executive directive of the UN environment programme, warned
yesterday, Bronwen Maddox, Environment Correspondent, reports.
'For ten years and more 'environment and development' has been on
everybody's lips but despite all the talk we find there is no hard
scientific evidence for any real improvement,' he declared.
Last night it emerged that Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell, assistant deputy
environment minister in Canada, will take over in January from Dr Tolba, who
is stepping down after 16 years.
Dr Tolba's speech, which fiercely attacked the ineffectiveness of the Rio
Earth Summit in June, accompanied Unep's report on the world environment
since 1972. Last night ministers from UN countries began flying to Nairobi
to mark Unep's 20th anniversary.
Despite Dr Tolba's pessimistic comments, Unep's 800-page report finds
encouragement in the measures industrialised countries have taken to curb
pollution.
In the US, Canada and western Germany, carbon monoxide emissions, mainly
from traffic, fell by more than 25 per cent between the mid-1970s and the
late 1980s.
The study identifies pollution in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
as one of Europe's greatest problems.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Japan's small manufacturers find themselves facing a
shake-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POINTING to a colourful 'bargain sale' catalogue for a local clothing store,
Mr Mitsunobu Nonaka recited a few of the heavily discounted prices and then
calmly concluded that 'we can't compete'.
Mr Nonaka runs a small sewing company, KM Clothing, in the southern island
of Kyushu, where he has four factories and 170 employees. KM will cut back
to 100 staff over the next year or so, and must undergo a character change
to support even that number.
The difficulties faced by KM Clothing and the bleak future confronting many
of its staff are signs of a shake-out of small manufacturers and the
changing nature of Japan's labour market. A Labour Ministry survey of larger
manufacturers released yesterday found 45 per cent carried out 'employment
adjustment' during the July to September quarter, through cuts in working
hours, job transfers or cuts in planned recruitment.
The situation is far more serious at small manufacturers such as KM,
particularly in the textile industry, which withstood the oil shocks of the
1970s and rapid yen appreciation in the 1980s, but cannot cope with a rush
of cheap imports from Chinese factories, many of them Japanese-funded
ventures. To illustrate this, Mr Nonaka returned to the clothing catalogue
and selected a men's zippered jacket, fully lined with a woollen collar and
a price tag of Y1,900, down from Y3,900: 'How can we compete with that kind
of price? It would cost us Y3,500 just to do the sewing work on that
jacket.'
Mr Nonaka has yet to come to terms with laying off his staff, most of them
women. He has just coached his workers to victory in a volleyball tournament
and the trophy stands just inside the largest of his factories, in Kumamoto
Prefecture. 'Until this year, we had struggled to find staff. That has all
changed this year. From September we started to get a lot of calls from
people who had lost jobs at other factories. We can't help them.'
Japan's ratio of jobs to applicants fell to 0.96:1 last month, meaning there
are more job seekers than vacancies for the first time since April 1988. The
unemployment rate remained unchanged at 2.2 per cent in November, but the
turnround in the labour market is likely to be reflected in coming months.
Mr Nonaka says only 30 per cent of the region's small textile producers will
survive in the longer term, as an increasing number of joint ventures come
on line in Shanghai, flooding the country with cheaper products. 'Three or
four years ago, there was no real threat from China, because their products
were cheap but of much lower quality. Now they are using Japanese
technology, their workers are more skilled and the quality is high, but the
labour cost is about an eighth of ours.'
Another problem for smaller manufacturers is that they must pay higher
interest on loans than larger companies. A car or electronics maker is able
to borrow from Japanese banks at about 4.5 per cent, but KM Clothing must
pay 6 per cent.
KM is trying to secure its future by taking a share in a Shanghai-based
venture. Most of these have been established through an industry association
in central Japan. The Seki Sewing China Friendship Association has organised
about 30 projects, all exporting clothes to Japan and most coming on line
over the past year. Two more overseas ventures were announced yesterday,
both reflecting a similar investment pattern. Mizuno, the sporting goods
company, is to import baseball gloves from a Vietnamese sewing venture
established by KSK, a Japanese maker based not far from KM Clothing. Itochu,
the trading house, will open a Shanghai ski-wear factory in partnership with
two Chinese and Japanese clothing makers.
Japanese manufacturing investment in China is expected to double this year.
Companies which delayed a cost-cutting move offshore during the heady days
of domestic growth in the late 1980s cannot afford to manufacture in Japan,
particularly in the face of intensifying competition from companies which
did make the move three years ago.
Mr Nonaka explained that his company can longer expect large orders from
Japanese designer labels, which are his main clients. In future, it will be
small-lot production at short notice, with some high-quality work for labels
insisting that their product be 'Made in Japan'.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Robust growth in Vietnam economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET

<DATELINE>
   HO CHI MINH CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Vietnamese economy performed robustly in 1992 despite the disappearance
of Soviet aid and the continuing economic boycott applied by the US since
the Vietnam war, Mr Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister, said yesterday.
In a confident assessment of Vietnam's economic prospects, he told the
National Assembly in Hanoi: '1992 is ending with a relative overall victory
in the economy, the first year we have fulfilled and even surpassed our main
targets.'
He unveiled a string of encouraging statistics: the economy as a whole will
grow an estimated 5.3 per cent this year, with industrial production up
about 15 per cent - a figure which includes growing oil output - and
agricultural production up 4.4 per cent.
Foreign investment will have increased 73 per cent and state revenues also
rose sharply because of more efficient tax collection; inflation has fallen
to about 15 per cent; and the local currency has stabilised following harsh
restrictions on the money supply.
Mr Vo Van Kiet attributed the strength of the economy to the policy of doi
moi or renovation, the Vietnamese version of perestroika since the late
1980s, although he acknowledged that much more needed to be done.
The current session of the National Assembly is not only revising foreign
investment regulations to attract further inflows of foreign capital but is
focusing on the problem of smuggling and official corruption. The government
would seek to stop bureaucrats wasting money.
The prime minister accepted the need for foreign borrowing to finance
badly-needed construction and repair of power stations, ports and roads.
But he said debt arrears had to be paid off and outlined a cautious approach
to future borrowing. 'We should not borrow to finance our day-to-day
spending,' he declared.
The Vietnamese government, with Vietnamese and American businesses, is
anxious for the US to lift or at least relax its economic embargo before
President George Bush leaves office in January.
Vietnam sees the US as a counterweight to the growing influence of Japan and
China, and is particularly keen to use loans - at present blocked by
Washington - from the World Bank, the International Money Fund and the Asian
Development Bank to pay for infrastructure projects and lay the foundations
for growth.

INDIA was gripped by a third day of violence yesterday, with the death toll
following the weekend destruction of the Ayodhya mosque rising above 700.
Police and troops were deployed in many cities in an attempt to suppress
continuing riots, arson attempts and stone-throwing attacks.
Worst-affected was Bombay, the commercial capital, where 150 have died. In
the city of Surat north of Bombay, 20 people were burned to death when a
building was set on fire.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, appealed for calm, saying Indians
had lived together for thousands of years. But he had no further measures to
announce on dealing with the violence or other consequences of Sunday's
assault on the Ayodhya mosque by Hindu militants during a rally organised by
the right-wing Bharatiya Janata party, the main opposition grouping.
The government has yet to disclose how it will fulfil two important pledges
made to Moslem leaders: a ban on militant activist groups and the rebuilding
of the Ayodhya mosque.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Takeshi Noda confirms slowdown of Japanese economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE likelihood of a prolonged slowdown of the Japanese economy was confirmed
yesterday by Mr Takeshi Noda, director-general of the Economic Planning
Agency, who said that Japan would have trouble reaching a 3.5 per cent
growth target in the next fiscal year, starting in April, Steven Butler
reports from Tokyo.
This is the first indication from a senior government minister that Japan's
economy, in the grip of the most severe downturn in nearly 20 years, would
not see strong recovery just around the corner. Mr Noda is the cabinet
minister responsible for monitoring performance of the economy and
co-ordinating economic policy.
Mr Noda said Japan needed to set its 1993 growth target at realistic levels
that would be achieved through policy efforts. Otherwise the government's
credibility would be undermined. Mr Noda's agency, in a monthly report,
yesterday confirmed that the economy remained in the doldrums due to a slump
in personal consumption and a decline in industrial outout.
The government's official growth forecast, which is drawn up for purposes of
fiscal planning, this year remains at 3.5 per cent, although this is
expected to be revised downward in the near future. Many private economists
expect growth to fall below 2 per cent.
The Japanese Diet is expected this week to pass a supplementary budget that
will provide legislative authority for the government's Y10,700bn emergency
economic plan announced in August. A further supplementary budget in the
spring is widely thought necessary in order to restore growth to the
economy.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Haiti puts itself high on the US agenda: Canute James on a
foreign policy headache for the new president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEAR of a huge influx of people from Haiti into the US is pushing the
country up President-elect Bill Clinton's foreign policy agenda, as pressure
grows to resolve Haiti's plight.
Mr Clinton's statements that he would allow Haitians to apply for asylum in
the US have been viewed in Haiti as a softening of the Bush administration's
approach, and the green light to a new wave of boat people.
This has raised the pressure for Mr Clinton to break the logjam over Haiti
prompted by the overthrow of former President Jean Bertrand Aristide by the
army 14 months ago. The Organisation of American States and the US have
railed against the Haitian military and imposed an economic blockade, but
have been embarrassed by their seeming impotence.
Meanwhile, Mr Aristide is becoming embittered and has not hidden his
frustration at the fact that he is not yet back in the presidential palace,
appearing to doubt the sincerity of the public commitments of several
governments.
Associates of Mr Aristide have expressed hope that Mr Clinton will make more
effort than Mr George Bush to resolve Haiti's constitutional, political and
economic crisis. They have already asked his advisers to try to involve the
European Community and the United Nations in efforts to force the military
leaders to accept Mr Aristide's return.
The OAS secretary general has asked Mr Michael Manley, a former Jamaican
prime minister, to jump-start negotiations for a return to constitutional
government in Haiti.
Mr Manley is seeking the support of several countries to get the UN
involved, and is reported to have already secured commitments from
Venezuela, Canada and France. One of the first aims is to get more
countries, especially EC members, to support the economic sanctions imposed
against Haiti by the OAS, but which have been, at best, sieve-like.
It is Mr Aristide's hope that the Clinton presidency will be more firm with
the military leaders, which explains his reluctance to participate in
discussions with Mr Manley and emissaries of Mr Marc Bazin, the figure-head
prime minister of the Haitian military. Contact with the Haitian authorities
would give the country's rulers some degree of respectability, say Mr
Aristide's aides, at a time when international pressure on Haiti will
increase.
The army's leaders also appear to have lost their patience with Mr Bazin,
whose mandate was to negotiate not the return of Mr Aristide, but the ending
of the embargo. Should he be sacked it would signal an end to military
efforts to find a diplomatic solution. Mr Aristide's supporters in Haiti
would not take this lightly.
The military is funding its oil and other necessary imports through a return
to the lucrative use of the country in the transshipment of narcotics.
Known supporters of Mr Aristide have been abused and some murdered, and
human rights agencies have concurred that dissenting voices are harshly
silenced. Amnesty International said civilian authorities were 'totally
unwilling or powerless' to stop torture, executions, arbitrary arrests and
other human rights abuses that had become part of daily life in Haiti.
Army leaders have said privately that Mr Aristide will not be allowed back
into the country under any circumstances. Their public position, articulated
by Mr Bazin, who came a distant second to Mr Aristide in the presidential
election just under two years ago, is that there is room for compromise.
Mr Aristide, maintains that senior army officers will be tried for treason
or sent into exile when he returns to office.
Any effort by Mr Clinton to bring the military into line, and undertakings
such as Mr Manley's, will have to overcome positions taken by people such as
Gen Raoul Cedras, the army leader, who said recently that Haiti's problems
should be resolved by Haitians, and not by 'meddling from overseas'.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Mexican interior minister, Mr Manuel Bartlett, has vehemently denied
claims by US federal prosecutors that he was involved in drug-running and in
the 1985 murder of Mr Enrique Camarena, an official of the US Drug
Enforcement Agency.
The accusations were made during the trial of Mr Alvarez Humberto Machain, a
Mexican doctor kidnapped by DEA agents to face charges in the US of aiding
the torture and murder of Mr Camarena.
The fall-out from the allegations may damage relations between the two
countries at a time when Mexico is keen to establish good terms with the
incoming Clinton administration.
US prosecutors accused Mr Bartlett, Mr Enrique Alvarez de Castillo, former
attorney-general, and Mr Juan Arevala, former defence minister, of accepting
money from the Guadalajara drugs cartel. They also claimed that some of them
were present at meetings in which Mr Camarena's murder was planned.
Mr Bartlett, governor-elect of the state of Pueblo, was education minister
until this year, and interior minister throughout former President Miguel de
la Madrid's administration. In the latter post he oversaw the controversial
1988 presidential elections that brought Mr Carlos Salinas to power. The
president may thus go to some lengths to protect him.
The US accusations drew a furious response from the Mexican government,
already incensed at the kidnapping of Mr Machain.
'The prosecution has acted irresponsibly and immorally to involve people who
have held important public offices based on the testimony of delinquents and
criminals who do not merit credibility in light of their personal history,'
the attorney-general's office said.
Mexico also condemned Mr Machain's kidnap as contrary to international law,
and an infringement of its national sovereignty. It thus argues that his
trial is itself illegal.

THE battle for the hearts and minds of insomniac American television viewers
yesterday escalated to unprecedented heights when CBS, the network
controlled by Mr Larry Tisch, tried to woo Mr David Letterman away from NBC
with a reputed annual salary offer of nearly Dollars 16m (Pounds 10.5m).
The 45-year-old Mr Letterman - an up-market comedian whose popular
late-night NBC chat show comes on one hour after NBC's legendary Tonight
Show - is known to have been unhappy at NBC ever since he lost the chance
last spring to take the Tonight Show over.
The brouhaha began when Mr Johnny Carson, who had been host of the Tonight
Show for decades, retired. NBC appointed Mr Jay Leno, a square-jawed
comedian who has been panned by many critics, in his place.
It appeared yesterday that CBS had offered Mr Letterman the chance to design
and own his late-night show at 11.30, placing him in direct competition with
Mr Leno.

FT  10 DEC 92 / West regrets Gaidar's rejection: Vote against acting PM seen
as blow to debt relief talks
</HEADLINE>

   BONN, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE rejection of Mr Yegor Gaidar as Russia's acting prime minister and
guardian of the economic reform process is seen as a serious setback to
western efforts to negotiate further debt relief and financial support for
President Boris Yeltsin's government.
Officials in European capitals made it clear that the upheaval in Moscow is
seen with grave concern. 'Nobody can be happy,' one said. 'Naturally it does
not help relationships to dismiss such a key man at such a sensitive moment.
What is needed now above all else is continuity, and a calm but decisive
hand.'
A Bonn Finance Ministry spokesman added: 'We also need continuity as a
signal to the west that Russia will meet its commitments, in exchange for
international co-operation.'
'We hope and assume that the discussion on the reform process in Russia will
continue, regardless of personnel decisions. We hope that happens, in the
interests of Russia and its population, and for the success of the
restructuring process.'
Senior German officials are seeking to finalise agreements before next week,
when Chancellor Helmut Kohl visits Moscow for his first top-level talks
since the departure of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and end of the Soviet Union.
In Washington, Senator Sam Nunn, the influential Georgia Democrat who chairs
the Senate armed services committee, said Mr Gaidar's rejection would be 'a
blow to Yeltsin and a blow to economic reform.' After a meeting with
President George Bush he said: 'There are other people who believe just as
fervently in the market economy as Gaidar, but he is now the symbol.'
Senator Richard Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate foreign relations
committee, said he believed President Yeltsin wanted to maintain both the
path of economic reform and Mr Gaidar, and might want to work out some way
in which the latter could 'continue to be effective.'
For his part, Mr Gaidar appeared sanguine. 'I think that the government
should carry on calmly,' he said. Others agreed with him. Mr Vladimir
Ispravnikov, chairman of the Supreme Economic Council of the Russian
parliament, said there 'was nothing terrible for Gaidar in this: he'll stay
as acting prime minister and the president will take responsibility for
him.'
Some even interpreted the vote to reject Mr Gaidar as a victory for him. His
political adviser, Mr Vladimir Mau, said: 'The vote confirms Gaidar as a
major political figure. We didn't expect anything like half. No other
candidate could have got as much.'
Although the votes were not recorded, it was clear that hardline groups of
nationalists and communists, such as Russian Unity, had voted against Mr
Gaidar coupled with so-called centrist factions such as the Industrial
Union, Smena and Agrarian Union.
However, the substantial vote for the prime minister means that the core
pro-government constituencies - the Parliamentary Reform Coalition - in the
Congress estimated yesterday to be between 300 and 350 deputies, has been
swollen by members from at least some of the centrist groups.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Panic allowed to challenge Milosevic

<TEXT>
THE Serbian Supreme Court ruled yesterday that Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan
Panic can challenge Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in elections on
December 20.
The court said its decision was final, meaning Mr Panic will be registered
as a candidate. It overturned a ruling by the Serbian electoral commission
disqualifying the prime minister on the grounds that he did not meet the
one-year residence requirement.
Mr Panic immediately challenged Mr Milosevic to a TV debate. In the grip of
Mr Milosevic, Serbian TV has been waging a campaign against the
Belgrade-born US millionaire.
Mr Panic has won popularity among Serbs for his pledge to end the war in
Bosnia and to persuade the United Nations to lift sanctions. He holds a
narrow lead over Mr Milosevic, according to opinion polls.
Mr Milosevic, widely seen as chief instigator of the war in Bosnia, said at
a campaign appearance: 'We will continue our policies. We cannot give up our
interests and rights and we'll protect them.'
In Sarajevo yesterday there was sporadic shelling but the strategic airport
road re-opened after intense fighting on Tuesday. Ten trucks carrying 150
tonnes of relief supplies for the 380,000 people trapped in the capital
arrived from Vitez.
In Geneva, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic accused Bosnian government
forces of provoking fighting to put pressure on the UN for military
intervention.
The UN Security Council declared yesterday it would consider stronger
measures against Bosnian Serbs 'as soon as possible' to ensure relief
supplies continued to reach Sarajevo.
Diplomats said no course of action had been determined, but measures could
include establishing safe havens for Bosnian Moslems or using air power to
protect relief convoys.
Nato allies today will discuss contingency plans for the former Yugoslavia,
ranging from more peacekeeping troops to using air strikes against Serb
targets.

A COURT yesterday sentenced a leading German neo-Nazi to two years and eight
months in jail as part of a crackdown on extreme-right violence against
foreigners and Jews, Reuter reports from Rudolstadt, Germany. Thomas Dienel,
the boss of the far-right DNP party, was found guilty by a court in the
eastern town of Rudolstadt of inciting racist violence by calling for the
mass murder of Jews and asylum seekers.
Separately, the German government announced that Dienel and another leading
neo-Nazi would be stripped of their constitutional rights.

THE German government yesterday approved a package of corporate tax reforms
designed to make the economy more attractive for investors, and stem a large
net outflow of investment capital.
The key elements in the draft law are a reduction in the peak rate of
corporation tax on retained profits from 53 to 44 per cent, and a cut in the
tax on distributed profits from 36 to 30 per cent.
There are also measures designed to help small and medium-sized companies,
including a new tax-free allowance of DM500,000 (Pounds 206,000) for death
duties.
The tax reform package was presented to the cabinet yesterday by Mr Theo
Waigel, the finance minister, who said it was intended to maintain Germany's
competitiveness as an investment location. Many countries had reduced their
top corporate tax rates to between 30 and 35 per cent, he said.
The package is intended to be self-financing, and the tax cuts have been
balanced by the reduction in a series of tax allowances. Thus the
depreciation allowance on movable assets is cut from 30 to 25 per cent.
The draft law, intended to pass through parliament next year and come into
effect on January 1, 1994, includes an extension of supplementary
depreciation allowances on investments in east Germany by two years, to the
end of 1996. The suspension of property tax and working capital tax in the
eastern Lander will also be extended to the end of 1995, Mr Waigel said.

The European Commission yesterday approved Ecu450m (Pounds 364m) of aid to
the former Soviet Union, including Ecu100m for programmes to improve nuclear
safety, writes Lionel Barber from Brussels.
Russia is the largest beneficiary, with one quarter of the aid focused in
the regions of St Petersburg, Moscow, Samara and Tyumen, mainly on helping
businesses in food production, distribution and energy.
Ukraine will receive Ecu48m. The Caucasian states - comprising Georgia,
Armenia and Azerbaijan - as well as the Central Asian states, including
Kazakhstan, will receive technical aid worth Ecu57.4m.
The EC money comes through the Tacis programme whose long-term goal is to
use technical aid to help the nascent private sector and build up a market
economy in the former Soviet republics.
Last year, the EC committed Ecu400m to the newly independent states.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Russian government prepares for walk-on role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government met last night fully expecting to be asked to
continue for three months in an acting capacity.
Its daily companion, the economic crisis, will also continue, though in a
more permanent capacity.
In that sense, the Seventh Congress of Peoples' Deputies, which yesterday
failed to confirm the appointment of Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister, has
changed nothing fundamental yet.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Gaidar, the acting prime
minister, offered important concessions to get support for Mr Gaidar's
appointment from the Congress centre - concessions of people and policies.
It was understood last night that those concessions will remain.
The personnel changes started in November, when in quick succession Mr
Yeltsin relieved Mr Yegor Yakovlev of his post as head of the Commonwealth
TV service, Mr Mikhail Poltoranin of his post as information minister and
moved Mr Gennady Burbulis from the post of state secretary to that of chief
adviser.
These were seen as bowing to the wishes of the centrist Civic Union bloc
with whom he wished to make an agreement: though in fact, Mr Yakovlev was an
appointee of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev with no secure base in the Yeltsin
nomenklatura, Mr Burbulis suffered no appreciable loss of power and Mr
Poltoranin is likely to get another high-level job soon.
As compromises they were fairly small beer.
The deal offered by Mr Yeltsin on Tuesday was a grander affair. To persuade
the deputies to vote for Mr Gaidar, he proposed that the Supreme Soviet, the
standing parliament, would have the right to confirm four ministers apart
from the premier - defence, foreign affairs, interior and security. This put
the unpopularly liberal Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, directly in
the firing line: he was to be a sacrifice for the preservation of Mr Gaidar.
Mr Gaidar said yesterday there would be further changes in the cabinet - but
stressed that this would be on the grounds of ability, not because others
wanted their jobs. 'The past year, he said, 'has shown that not everyone in
the cabinet can cope with their responsibilities.' The policy changes are
potentially more serious. In the last few days, Mr Gaidar or Mr Yeltsin have
promised a long delay in rises in the oil price to world levels, the
indexing of the billions of roubles in personal savings and an end to the
decline in production and living standards.
Underpinning their new policy is a document which has been agreed between
the government and the Civic Union. Called 'Urgent Measures to Take Russia
out of its Crisis', it is in effect an agreement for the government to
protect, promote and support Russian industry: in its key phrase, to conduct
a 'managed transition' to the market economy.
In part, this policy is already in place. Russian companies are protected by
fantastically cheap inputs, though their low quality of output means they
have not yet capitalised on this - and on the undervalued rouble - by
exporting much.
The policy also allows for the pumping of credits, more or less
indiscriminately, into enterprises, good and bad. As Mr Gaidar put it
yesterday, he wished to give the crisis 'a more structural character': that
is, he wants the credits to go to the winners, and the losers to go to the
wall.
It is a policy on which a compromise with the industrialists can be based.
But it is not, according to the foreign financial experts in Moscow, a
policy for financial stability. Nor, on the face of it, will it help to get
inflation down to 2 per cent a week (from 4 per cent) as Mr Gaidar promised
yesterday.
Mr Yeltsin, Mr Gaidar and his cabinet all stress that inflation, and the
fear of hyperinflation, is their main concern: but if it is, they have, as
yet, no explicit programme for combating it.
No government could survive, unpunished, with such a record as Mr Gaidar's
in a fully functioning democracy: the fact that the votes for and against
yesterday were so evenly balanced showed that he had won over part of the
centre. (There is even the prospect that his premiership might be proposed
over and over again until he wins.)
Meanwhile, the government is, as it well knows, saddled with the task of
allowing most things to get worse in order to clear the space for them to
get better. And the Congress has neither been able to affect the likelihood
of things getting worse, nor bring forward the time when they will get
better.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF PEOPLE'S DEPUTIES
1060 deputies; 4 main groups; 14 factions
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PARLIAMENTARY REFORM COALITION, the so-called radical democrats, has
251 deputies and firmly supports the Yeltsin-Gaidar government. The
coalition is the successor of the DemRossiya movement which brought
Yeltsin to power.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CENTRE is divided into two groups, both of which overlap with the
Civic Union, an unstable alliance of 'centrist' political figures who
have been negotiating with the government on conditions for supporting
it.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Democratic Centre grouping has 200 deputies who represent, among
others, the Unaffiliated Deputies, the Left Centre and the Popular Free
Russia Party (whose honourary chairman is Vice-President Alexander
Rutskoi). This grouping is divided over whether to support the
government and what policy changes to demand. It is closely identified
with the Civic Union.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Creative Forces grouping has 151 deputies and represents, among
others, the Industrial Union, a conservative industrialist faction which
is not part of the Civic Union, and Smena (Change of Guard), which is
officially part of the Civic Union but wants a change of government.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
RUSSIAN UNITY has 355 deputies and unites communist and militant
nationalists. It includes factions such as the Communists of Russia and
the Agrarian Union, which embraces the directors of state farms.
Russian Unity virulently opposes the government and its economic reform
programme.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Bundesbank is urged to relax inflation stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank was warned yesterday that it will damage both the German
economy and its own reputation and policies if it does not relax its
hardline campaign against inflation.
As the bank's central council met to fix its money supply targets for 1993 -
an important signpost for its future interest rates policy - the
authoritative DIW economics institute in Berlin claimed inflation was under
control.
'One can predict with great certainty that west German inflation will sink
in 1993 and in following years,' it said. The institute said central bank
policy-makers should focus on establishing a monetary policy based on the
economy's ability to expand rather than a policy based on its own inflation
ideals although prices are rising at almost twice the 2 per cent rate sought
by the bank.
Implying that interest rate cuts were needed, the institute said
'impatience' over achieving its inflation goal at a time when the economy
was losing momentum would be damaging. It argued that reluctance among
western companies to invest would endanger recovery in the east. This in
turn would make it more difficult for the federal government - at present
the main source of capital and income in the former East Germany - to rein
in spending.
In this case, if the Bundesbank interpreted its inflation aims too narrowly,
its appeals to government, employers and unions for action to ensure
stability would lose their credibility, the institute said.
DIW, which has close contacts with the Bundesbank, was one of the leading
institutes which recently advised the bank to increase its mid-range money
supply target for next year to 7 per cent. The current comparable figure is
4.5 per cent, while the October annual growth rate in the M3 measure was
over 10 per cent.
M3, which comprises sight deposits, deposits of less than four years'
maturity, most savings accounts and circulating cash, is usually viewed by
the bank as an indicator of inflation trends.
The results of yesterday's M3 meeting - due to be announced today - are
widely expected to involve a wider target range with the upper limit raised
significantly above the current 5.5 per cent. The lower limit, now 3.5 per
cent, is forecast to change less. This would send a signal that the bank
still has to be convinced that inflation is under control.
This year's 4.5 per cent M3 mid-range figure stems mainly from the bank's
estimate of 2.5 per cent growth potential in the economy and its ideal 2 per
cent inflation rate. Main elements in the economic institutes'
recommendation of 7 per cent are potential growth of 3 per cent (actual
growth is expected to be nil) and 3 per cent inflation (expected to be at
least 3.5 per cent).

FT  10 DEC 92 / Brussels approves state aid for Fiat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday approved up to L5,189bn (Pounds 2.5bn) of
state aid for Fiat, the Italian carmaker, one of the largest state subsidies
sanctioned by Brussels in recent years.
The aid is part of a wide-ranging L12,000bn programme of investment by the
Italian group in the depressed Mezzogiorno region of southern Italy,
including the construction of a car plant and an engine plant.
The Commission decided that L10,442bn of investment was eligible for
regional and research subsidies of which it has approved L4,884bn for
regional subsidies and a soft loan of L305bn for research.
Commission officials said yesterday that although Italy was adding capacity
of 450,000 small cars, most of that increase would be offset by capacity
cuts in northern Italy. 'Overall (the plan) adds only 0.2 to EC car
capacity,' said an official, and 3 per cent to Fiat group capacity.
The Commission also judged that the difficulty of opening plants in the
Mezzogiorno and the region's serious economic problems justified a high
level of government aid.
The Commission said that although the investment was being made immediately,
the subsidies would be paid at the end of the project in 1995. The impact
may be diluted to around 30.5 per cent of the eligible expenditure.
The Commission approved aid yesterday of DM260m for a new Opel car plant at
Eisenach in eastern Germany, part of a total investment of DM1.27bn.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Slovenia wears an air of prosperity on road to reform:
Elections are unlikely to mean a change of economic policy, although social
problems are pressing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELL-GROOMED gardens and tidy houses dot the picturesque countryside giving
the impression of prosperity in Slovenia, sandwiched between the Alps and
the Adriatic. Ljubljana, the capital, is gripped by the sense of moving
forward and has left the war-torn Yugoslavia behind.
While Slovene politicians vie to form a coalition after parliamentary
elections, economists are confident the new government will not stray from
reforms which have made the tiny republic the success story of former
Yugoslavia.
Mr Mitja Gaspari, the finance minister, says economic policy will not hinge
on the 'colours' of the new coalition. 'Any government will be faced with
the same problems and will implement the programme of economic reforms.'
In last Sunday's elections, ultra-nationalists captured 10 per cent of the
vote, accusing Bosnian and other 'foreigners' of taking Slovene jobs. As
enterprises are restructured, 30,000 workers are expected to be sacked next
year, prompting politicians to consider a social safety net, including
retraining programmes and cash grants to stimulate hiring.
The cost of independence has been high, but Slovenes agree it was worth it.
After a 10-day war in June, 1991, the republic won independence from
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.  Slovenia was spared the devastation of
neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Joze Mencinger, a noted Slovene economist, said: 'All the warnings were
ignored about the economic cost. Now, after a year-and-a-half in light of
all the developments in the rest of Yugoslavia it was worth it to become
independent.' He believes the situation is good given the external shocks.
After the collapse of the Yugoslav federation, Slovenia moved quickly to
bolster trade with other European countries. Germany, Italy France and
Austria account for 70 per cent of Slovene exports.
Slovenia has applied for, and shortly expects to be given, membership of the
International Monetary Fund. Programmes for the improvement of
telecommunications, rails and roads are under discussion with the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The upsurge in foreign trade helped Slovenia accumulate Dollars 1.2bn
(Pounds 780m) in foreign currency reserves. The Slovene tolar, introduced
last October, has remained stable. Despite the bright spots, Mr Mencinger
warns: 'We are in the middle of a depression . . . we lost more than 50 per
cent of the so-called foreign market.' But he believes that Slovenia may
have 'reached the bottom of the cycle'.
Hit by the loss of the exports to the Yugoslav republics, industrial output
dropped by 10 per cent in 1991. Unemployment is at 11.5 per cent. Strict
monetary and fiscal control reduced the rate of inflation to 2.5 per cent
last month from 18 per cent in the same period of 1991. Gross domestic
product declined by 9 per cent in 1991 to about Dollars 12bn.
Few businessmen or economists hold out hope of burgeoning trade with the
former Yugoslav republics. 'We are faced with completely destroyed economies
which I don't think can recover within the next decade. They may be in an
even worse position than after the Second World War,' says Mr Mencinger.
Some 1,216 enterprises were loss-makers accounting for 12 per cent of the
GDP. A restructuring programme for 16 of the biggest losers, in the steel,
power and railway industries, is expected to start in the spring.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Young and old take up 'Bolshevik' shares offer
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS the Congress of Peoples Deputies yesterday decided the fate of Mr Yegor
Gaidar, Russia's acting prime minister, ordinary Russians gave a cautious
show of support for his market reforms at the country's first share auction.
Displaying a mixture of curiosity, excitement and caution, young and old
queued to apply to swap their privatisation vouchers for shares in
Bolshevik, a state-owned enterprise which produces 250 tonnes a day of some
of the capital's sweetest cakes and biscuits.
'I don't agree with those who curse the government for distributing vouchers
free of charge to every Russian citizen. We have nothing to lose, we can
only hope that something positive will come out of them,' said Mr Viktor
Vogman, an engineer.
Founded by the French in 1856 before it was nationalised by the Bolsheviks,
the enterprise is returning to private hands as part of the government's
privatisation programme, which involves 6,000 enterprises going under the
hammer over the next year.
Mr Gleb Smirnov, a 79-year-old pensioner, said the country's leaders 'should
be ashamed of dragging the country into this mess' but said he would look
into the Bolshevik share offering because he lived next to the factory. 'We
see the queues there, they must be doing something right,' said his
companion, Ms Clavdia Sokolova. Handing in her form to buy as many shares as
she could, she said: 'I hope the enterprise makes money but I don't need
anything for myself. I just had to get rid of this voucher: it was my civic
duty.' Mr Igor Mitvol, one of Russia's new entrepreneurs, said he was
filling out a form to buy 150 vouchers' worth of shares 'just to see what
happens'.
To sweeten the deal for a suspicious workforce, the company has arranged to
buy 51 per cent of the shares for its employees: another five per cent is
being given to them free of charge by the state. The remaining 44 per cent,
or 19,000 shares, are being offered to the general public (including
Bolshevik workers with an appetite for more) in the auction which closes on
December 24.
The real fear of management, led by general director Oleg Shimanov, is that
they could lose control. For this reason, no more than five per cent of the
shares can go to a single bidder, even though there is nothing to stop
workers and other shareholders from reselling their shares in a secondary
market to start in January.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: The S word: teach yourself
summit-speak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is subsidiarity?
The principle - originally a part of Catholic doctrine - that decisions
should be taken at the lowest appropriate level. But this is only one
definition among many. Cynics say subsidiarity means anything and nothing.
Many believe EC leaders at Edinburgh should sort out what the word actually
means before they start deciding how it should be applied.
. . . . and transparency?
Euro-speak for openness. The Community would be more 'transparent' if
policy-makers consulted citizens more often, held more debates in public and
refused to use words like subsidiarity and transparency.
So why do we need these principles?
To bring EC decision-making 'closer to the citizen', according to the
conclusions of the October's Birmingham summit. Member governments and the
Commission believe greater openness will help a disgruntled populace
understand how and why the Community acts. The application of subsidiarity -
or 'nearness' as the leaders described it at Birmingham  - should ensure
that citizens are not vexed by unnecessary EC measures which could be better
handled at national level.
What might be decided at Edinburgh?
Rules for applying subsidiarity: for example, the circumstances in which
member states, rather than the Community, should take responsibility for
telling their citizens what to do. The big member states have also pressed
for the right to put legislation through a subsidiarity test at the draft
stage. These efforts have been resisted by their smaller EC partners who see
this as a way of overriding their ally, the Commission.
It all sounds a bit theoretical - what will this actually mean?
There could be substantive changes to legislation. Some measures may be
scrapped or amended. The Commission and member states have been compiling
hit-lists of existing and proposed EC laws which could be revised or
withdrawn in the interests of subsidiarity. The real argument will be about
the size of the legislative bonfire and what should be on it.
The UK, for example, has suggested that 71 directives should be scrapped,
including some controversial environmental and social affairs legislation.
The Commission has a more modest list of 24.
Will there be any real effort to increase transparency?
Certainly. John Major's idea of televising the opening of the Birmingham
summit was pooh-poohed by fellow leaders, but at Edinburgh they will
consider giving the public 'access' to important policy debates between
ministers - possibly by televising them to journalists.
What are the likely benefits of all this?
Well, if decision-making is made more open and guidelines on subsidiarity
are respected, policy-makers may at least think twice before drafting or
approving unnecessarily intrusive legislation.
. . . . and the risks?
The main risk is that member states will use the subsidiarity principle as a
weapon to fight for national interest, by resisting legislation they do not
like. That could undermine the single market, disarm EC environmental
legislation, much of which has to be centrally policed, or render Community
competition policy toothless.
But at least the process will be out in the open, won't it?
Not entirely. Much of the wheeling and dealing between member states will
still go on behind closed doors - in meetings between senior diplomats in
Brussels, for example, or at so-called 'informal' meetings between
ministers. Policy debates may prove entertaining - although speechifying in
nine languages seems unlikely to top the TV ratings - but the serious
horse-trading will still take place in camera rather than on camera.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Danish No voters start to wobble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMUNITY leaders struggling to find a solution to the Danish problem must
hope that not all Danes are as uncompromising as the middle-aged couple who
run a flower shop in the Copenhagen suburb of Frederiksberg.
'We voted No last time and we'll vote No again. We don't want them deciding
everything for us. We want to stay independent,' says Bodil, who runs the
shop with his wife, Mogens.
The flower shop hardliners underline the difficulties of trying to make
revised Maastricht proposals palatable both to other EC governments and to a
sceptical domestic electorate.
Assuming Denmark can agree at Edinburgh a deal on its Maastricht
reservations, the proposals will have to be passed by another referendum,
probably next May or June, to allow the treaty to take effect.
For the Danish sceptics, the priority is to prevent the bigger EC countries
and the bureaucrats of Brussels from interfering in Danish life.
Other Danes, however, are less trenchant. A sizeable number of people who
said No in the June 2 referendum, when the treaty was rejected by 46,000
votes, are clearly thinking of voting Yes next time. But former Yes voters
who plan to say No next time are very hard to find.
Forecasts of dire problems for the Danish economy if the country again
rejects Maastricht are undoubtedly helping to strengthen the tendency. The
government believes that 100,000 Danish jobs may have been lost as the
result of uncertainty since June.
The Frederiksberg florists' young assistant, ear-ringed and with his hair
knotted at the back, voices a typical waverer's view: 'I voted No in June,'
he says.
'But with all this currency trouble and the unemployment, I'm worried about
what happens to the economy if we vote No again.'
European defence co-operation - a key area where Denmark is seeking a
Maastricht exemption - is another topic of concern.
Ms Heidi Petersen, a 21-year-old office assistant from Roskilde, near
Copenhagen, voted No in June because she was afraid that when she has
children they might one day have to serve in a European defence force.
'If they make it so that we don't have to join a European army, I'll vote
Yes next time,' she says.
However, some currents of opinion are running in the opposite direction. A
pro-Maastricht Copenhagen doctor, who voted for the treaty in June, said he
worried that there would be a second No.
He cited signs of growing nationalism in Denmark, as well as the rest of
Europe, and feared that the upsurge of racialist violence in Germany would
cause many Danes to vote No.
In October, when Denmark's political parties agreed on the special
arrangements they several opinion polls pointed to a substantial majority in
a second referendum.
But a Yes vote would be in danger if this so-called 'national compromise'
breaks down - as it has threatened to do this week after the presentation of
Britain's Maastricht proposals. As the Danish government tries to balance
objections to a tortuous series of amendments to a somewhat ethereal treaty,
the plot at the palace of Holyrood House could easily start to look like a
scene from Hamlet's Elsinore.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Budget row dulls the jewel in UK crown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At five minutes to midnight on the last day of the Edinburgh summit, the
plan for the future financing of the European Community is settled, and the
British budget rebate, won by Margaret Thatcher in 1985, is secured for
another five years.
THIS WAS the unshakeable vision of a senior British official over six months
ago, on the eve of the UK presidency. That assurance has evaporated, as the
Community has sunk into perhaps its worst crisis of confidence, and
relations between Britain and its partners have reached a low ebb.
Getting a deal on the financing plan, known as the Delors II package, was to
have been the jewel in the UK presidency's crown. 'Delors I', the EC's first
five-year financing and budget control programme, was agreed in February
1988 under German chairmanship.
It was and is regarded by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission
president, and by German ministers and officials, as the decision which
relaunched the Community, making possible the Single Market and signposting
the road to political, economic and monetary union.
Yet when Delors I was conceived there was confident prosperity - not, as
now, a time of recession, intra-Community rancour, and political uncertainty
across Europe. Getting a Delors II deal in Edinburgh may be possible,
precisely because the EC badly needs to drag itself out of the mire. Few are
betting on it.
In 1988, Germany, the biggest net EC contributor, was willing to settle with
Spain, the leading supplicant among poorer member states, and double the
structural funds aimed at helping disadvantaged regions get ready for the
Single Market. But since reunification, Germany is an unhappy paymaster.
When Mr Delors unveiled his second five-year plan in February, only Spain,
Ireland, Portugal and Greece - intended beneficiaries of a further doubling
of fiscal transfers from the EC budget - were unalloyed enthusiasts. Germany
and the UK, the two main net contributors, objected, backed by the
Netherlands, and later by an Italy struggling to reduce its budget deficits
and public debt in line with Maastricht's tight membership criteria for
monetary union. The Germans and Dutch have also led demands that the UK's
rebate, worth a total of Pounds 12.5bn since 1985, be reduced, even though
Britain insists this is non-negotiable.
Edinburgh has shaped up as a battle between UK restrictiveness, and Spanish
unwillingness to settle for much less than the doubling in fiscal transfers
to which it insists the Twelve committed themselves at Maastricht.
The UK two weeks ago presented what it called a compromise. This would mean
an increase in the annual budget from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54bn) now to
Ecu79.4bn (in 1992 money) in 1999. The original Delors II plan wanted a rise
to Ecu87.5bn by 1997 - an increase of nearly a third in real terms. Last
month, however, Mr Delors revived a plan rejected at June's Lisbon summit,
to stretch a smaller increase over seven years, getting to Ecu80.2bn by
1997, and Ecu86.2bn by 1999. This would raise total fiscal transfers for
regional and cohesion spending from Ecu18.6bn now to Ecu27.3bn in 1997 and
Ecu30.2bn in 1999 - close to what Spain and its allies want, but at the
expense of planned increases in areas such as Research &amp; Development coveted
by France.
The British compromise would raise cohesion spending only to Ecu23bn in
1997, and Ecu23.8bn in 1999. The UK appears to believe that extending the
new Cohesion Fund - created at Maastricht - for a further two years will be
a sufficient sop to Spain. This fund, to help poorer members meet EC
environmental standards and complete missing EC transport links, is charged
with political symbolism. But it is worth less than a tenth of what these
countries receive in EC development aid, known as the Structural Funds.
Spanish ministers say the UK offer is not worth discussing. One senior
Commission official calls it 'unacceptable: it is not a compromise'. This
view is echoed among some French, Italian, Dutch and German officials
because they fear the EC could become little more than a clearing house for
fiscal transfers and farm spending. There would be little left over for
other Community policies, and the looser, inter-governmental co-operation
the UK favours would triumph over 40 years of integration.
Much more is at stake than money for the so-called 'Club Med' countries.
Nearly all 12 want more money for a beefed up common foreign policy, and
France is leading a drive for more spending directed at industry. As Mr
Delors said last week in a letter to EC leaders, 'let us remember that the
Community devotes Ecu274 per inhabitant to research, against Ecu528 in the
United States and Ecu619 in Japan'.
There are many who agree the EC should give itself the financial muscle to
compete internationally. This weekend should make clear if Community leaders
will put EC money where their EC mouth is.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Swallow hard: here's the menu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH QUESTION: The toughest issue on the Edinburgh agenda. Denmark's
rejection of the Maastricht treaty last June triggered the political crisis
in the Community. EC leaders must find a way to bring the mutineers back on
board, or face a messy divorce. But if they give up too much, they risk
creating a Community a la carte. The UK has put forward a solution based on
a summit declaration, but it remains unclear whether this will meet Danish
demands for a 'legally binding' agreement on a UK-style opt-out on a common
currency, defence force and EC citizenship.
ENLARGEMENT: Expect progress here. EC leaders at the summit in Lisbon last
June agreed to make enlargement talks conditional on a budget deal and
ratification of Maastricht by all member states. Under German pressure,
France has now softened its insistence on linkage, accepting that
negotiations can begin early next year with Austria, Finland, Sweden - and
possibly Norway - even though Britain and Denmark will not have ratified by
then. Spain's demand for a larger slice of the budget pie remains the main
obstacle.
BUDGET: Nothing moves in the Community without money. Recession has made
richer member states such as Germany much warier about supporting Jacques
Delors' original plan to raise EC spending by one-third over the next seven
years. Britain has led opposition to a fatter EC budget, but its own
proposals enraged less wealthy member states led by Spain. Along with
Ireland, Portugal and Greece, Spain is demanding the 'cohesion' fund
promised under the Maastricht treaty which is the 'bribe' for pressing their
economies into line with their northern partners in the drive to monetary
union.
SUBSIDIARITY, TRANSPARENCY: Once viewed as a silver bullet to deal with
fears about an overpowerful Brussels bureaucracy. But even Jacques Delors
now points out that subsidiarity can only be applied rigorously in a federal
system - which the EC is not. Look to EC leaders to use subsidiarity and
openness as a way to convince sceptical citizens that the Community is
mending its ways, with ritual scrapping of proposed and existing EC laws.
Political declaration at Edinburgh may also help sway votes in Denmark and
in the House of Commons on Maastricht ratification.
GATT: Time-bomb now defused. Two big risks were that the UK would lead a
free-trade bloc to isolate France, which opposes the EC-US agreement on farm
export subsidies, or that France would link a solution to the EC budget
wrangle to renegotiation of the EC-US deal. Most likely outcome is that
leaders will avoid polemics and 'contain' the Gatt question.
GROWTH PACKAGE: Lots of talk, but little prospect of immediate action. A
Commission paper suggests more spending on public works, particularly
linking eastern and western Europe in telecoms and roads, as well as closer
co-ordination of economic policies. The UK frets that Jacques Delors wants
to 'hijack' the summit with a superficially attractive growth package.
Brussels wants to talk about growth to show that the Community speaks for
ordinary people's needs, and to prod a sleepy European Investment Bank to
support more capital projects, probably through a new European Investment
Fund offering loan guarantees. Summit likely to agree guidelines for action
only, and to call for closer co-operation with US on economic policy.
SITES: Everything up for grabs, from the site for the European Central Bank,
to the Trademark Office, to the Medicines Agency. Britain blocked a deal at
Lisbon by pressing London's cause as a site for the operational arm of the
Central Bank. Now the case for Bonn seems irresistible, particularly given
growing fears about German attitudes to a monetary union which would mean
giving up the D-Mark. If EC leaders fail to agree on a site for the Central
Bank, it would send a negative signal to financial markets already sceptical
about the Emu timetable.
MIGRATION: EC ministers have agreed to toughen policy toward illegal
immigrants and bogus asylum-seekers in response to the refugee crisis in
Europe. Most attention is focused on economic refugees from eastern Europe,
particularly Yugoslavia, but Mediterranean countries are pressing for the EC
to prepare for the next migratory wave from the Maghreb. Watch Chancellor
Kohl make a diplomatically phrased pitch for other EC members to share some
of the burden of east European refugees, expected to reach more than 500,000
in 1992. Germany is likely to take 440,000 of these.
YUGOSLAVIA: Much hand-wringing expected, particularly from Germany, which is
bearing the brunt of the refugee exodus. EC leaders are unlikely to shift
toward a more aggressive policy toward Serbia, but they may press for a
stricter policing of the UN arms embargo along the Danube. They are likely,
too, to point to the planned international conference on Bosnia to take
place in Geneva on December 16. On Macedonia, EC leaders are being pressed
by Greece to stick to the Lisbon agreement to recognise the former Yugoslav
republic as an independent state provided it does not use the name
'Macedonia.' The best outcome may be a decision by most member states to
recognise it - while not forcing Greece to do likewise.
PARLIAMENT: Germany wants more MEPs - 18 more, to be exact - to reflect the
addition of the new Lander. A straight increase in German deputies is
resisted by France, which thinks it could herald a round of German
power-grabbing in other EC institutions. The most likely solution seems to
be extra MEPs all round, with the final numbers for each of the 12 decided
on the basis of population and political horse-trading.
OPENING OF THE SINGLE MARKET: The only issue which the UK has always
intended to proclaim as a triumphant success for its presidency. Main
interest will be generated by British attempts to finesse the question of
border controls on people: not only will such controls not be lifted on
January 1, they may still be in place a year hence. Other member states are
dragging their feet, but Britain is still the most stubborn opponent of
abolishing passport checks. Expect a diplomatic fudge: a declaration
welcoming the single market, but with caveats about frontier controls, and
emphasis on 'making the single market work' for business and the consumer.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Delors the Euro-militant praises the
British - This is a chance to end the smouldering crisis says EC president

<TEXT>
IT WAS supposed to be a tour d'horizon, but Mr Jacques Delors' pre-summit
press conference turned out to be a tour de force, writes Lionel Barber in
Brussels.
In vintage form, the European Commission President yesterday displayed the
combination of intellect and passion which still makes him a force to be
reckoned with when it comes to the future of the EC.
'I am a militant European,' he declared in response to a questioner who
dared ask whether the Danish rejection of Maastricht and the resulting
currency turmoil meant that the process of closer European integration had
reached its high water-mark.
'I hope the process of European construction will continue ..there is no
third way between survival and decline.'
Mr Delors set out the stakes for the leaders and citizens of the EC on the
eve of the Edinburgh summit. It was, he said, a chance to end the
smouldering crisis of recent months.
He urged member states to rally behind the so-called Delors II package which
calls for an increase in the Community budget by the end of the decade well
above a counter-proposal put forward by the UK presidency.
Without proper future funding, the EC would risk a retreat into an ivory
tower, he said. It would turn its back on 70m people in the EC's poorer
rural regions, emasculate the research budget needed to improve European
competitiveness, and kill off hopes of making the Community a serious player
on the global stage, particularly in efforts to help the former communist
countries in eastern Europe.
'At one extreme,' he warned, 'by the year 2000, you could just have a large
single market, anaemic common policies, and just a cheque-writing operation
for the poorer members. That is not acceptable.'
Mr Delors said it was wrong to accept 'mediocre commitments' from member
states with 'short-term budgetary problems' - a side-swipe at Germany, the
traditional paymaster in the EC which has taken a tougher line as a result
of the huge costs of unification.
But Mr Delors remained by and large a team player. He praised the UK draft
on the Danish question as 'extremely subtle', and he signalled support for
early talks on enlargement with Austria, Finland, Sweden, and possibly
Norway, next year - on condition that a budget deal was reached and Denmark
and the UK ratified the Maastricht treaty by summer 1993.
Reuter adds: EC officials yesterday urged Mr Delors to press EC leaders to
step up the fight against racism and neo-Nazi aggression in Europe.
EC inaction was helping to increase neo-Nazi violence against immigrant and
other minority groups and desecration of places of worship and cemeteries,
an open letter to Mr Delors signed by more than 2,500 civil servants said.
'The fight against these actions is not being led with the necessary
determination. This constitutes an indirect encouragement for these neo-Nazi
groups,' they said.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Kohl 'brainstorming by telephone'in
search for Community accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl may be determined to avoid transforming Europe into a
'glorified free trade area,' or 'Europe a la carte,' where every member
state can pick or choose the policies it follows, but he is also set on
getting an agreement in Edinburgh.
Behind the scenes, the chancellor's key EC advisers have been carrying on an
extraordinarily close liaison with their British and French counterparts, in
an effort to forge an acceptable deal on the range of issues on the agenda.
'It has been brainstorming by telephone,' according to one official
involved. Any suggestion of an Anglo-German chill is flatly rejected, with
both sides said to be in 'deep and excellent contact'. The heads of
government have talked on the telephone every week, as the British
presidency stepped up its effort to cobble together a series of compromises.
The decision to order such unusually close contacts was taken by Mr Kohl and
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, at their bilateral summit at
Ditchley Park in early November, when it looked as though time was running
out for reaching a deal at Edinburgh.
It also reflects the deep personal commitment of the German chancellor to
the ratification of the Maastricht treaty by all 12 EC member states.
Mr Kohl has made European union his overriding political ambition. He has
disregarded opinion polls suggesting that his electors are profoundly
suspicious of economic and monetary union, if it means giving up their
strong and precious D-Mark. Instead, he has made it clear that the
unification of Europe is his second great political goal, following the
unification of Germany.
Behind that commitment, he has confided to his close aides, is a fear that
if European integration is not achieved while he is chancellor, his
successors may not have the same determination to follow it through.
When some German officials and commentators floated ideas about pressing
ahead with a two-speed or variable-speed Europe - leaving behind doubters
like Britain and Denmark, and weaker currency countries such as Italy,
Spain, Portugal and Greece - the Chancellor has instantly condemned them. He
wants a Europe of 12 member states, and rapid enlargement negotiations to
bring in Austria and the Scandinavians.
Yet it is a fine line he is treading. He is equally determined that the
doubters in Britain and Denmark shall not continue to dictate the slow pace
of integration, nor begin to unravel what has been achieved to date. And
with his own economy slipping into recession, and facing huge bills for the
revival of eastern Germany, he is desperate to keep his EC budget
contributions under control.
On Denmark, the strategy is clearly to push the Danes to the limit of what
they can accept, to refuse flatly any renegotiation of the treaty, but still
to get a deal in the end.
On the budget, the aim is to find enough money to satisfy the weaker
economies, while keeping a strict ceiling on the overall finances.
What Mr Kohl has clearly realised is that his best bet to achieve all of
that is not to do so by sniping at the British presidency, but by giving all
the help and support he can.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Wily Mitterrand finds way out of
summit clash over farm subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOLATION at an EC summit is not a position to which President Francois
Mitterrand, longest serving of Community leaders, is accustomed.
At one stage, it looked as though France might be placed in the dock at
Edinburgh for its rooted opposition to the EC-US agreement on farm trade in
the Gatt negotia tions.
So, it is with considerable relief that Mr Mitterrand now feels that he has
the active connivance of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the passive
acquiescence of Prime Minister John Major, to ensure that the issue will not
figure too high on the Edinburgh agenda.
The odds are that Mr Mitterrand will be satisfied if his fellow leaders
follow their foreign and farm ministers earlier this week in insisting that
the agreement be balanced by progress in areas like services and tariffs.
As the president made clear in an interview with the FT this week, his
bottom line is that no amount of progress in the non-farm aspects of the
Gatt negotiations can compensate for what France feels is an unfair
agricultural bargain with Washington.
But he will not feel forced to make a stand unless Mr Major insists on
hailing the farm agreement in the Edinburgh communique.
Paris is fairly confident that Bonn, in its intensive pre-summit contacts
with London, will have persuaded Mr Major not to push the matter.
But Mr Mitterrand cannot be totally certain of that until this evening, when
he dines with Mr Major in the Scottish capital.
Partly in its bid to win southern European support for its Gatt position,
France is now readier to agree demands by Spain and other poorer EC states
for extra structural economic aid from an enlarged EC budget.
France is the third largest net contributor to the budget, after Germany and
Britain. 'We cannot agree to all that is demanded of us,' said Mr
Mitterrand, 'but we are ready to accept a lot.'
However, there is one French position of principle that could prove awkward
for the UK presidency.
Mr Mitterrand will stress that the richer countries promised more money for
the poorer ones at the Maastricht summit a year ago, and that all the
Maastricht commitments, including, of course, ratification of the treaty,
must be respected.
On this, Mr Mitterrand says he is quite inflexible. He will take a hard line
both against giving any general opt-out from the treaty for Denmark, and
against any appearance by the UK government that it is trying to hide behind
Denmark by delaying the final House of Commons ratification decision until
after a second Danish referendum.
With barely disguised contempt, he said this week: 'I don't see how Great
Britain can submit its decision to another country.'
He added: 'Europe is not stalled. Ten countries out of 12 have ratified. One
country said no. . . Britain is lagging behind and the delay should not be
too lengthy but I have not given up hope of seeing Britain adhere to the
treaty.'

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Tide of malaise that threatens to
engulf Major - Ian Davidson strips away the political drama and finds the EC
facing profound historical choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government lives in fear that the European summit it is hosting
in Edinburgh tomorrow and Saturday will turn out to be a total disaster. If
the omens of failure prove true, the Community will be precipitated into a
deep political crisis; and there will be a chorus of denunciation from the
other member states, blaming it all on Britain.
Strictly speaking, such denunciations will be unjustified; they will also be
beside the point. The immediate symptom of the crisis is the rejection of
the Maastricht treaty by the Danish electorate in their referendum last
June. The British government may have made that crisis much worse, by its
prevarication in the House of Commons, and its undisguised dissent from the
underlying objectives of the treaty in Brussels. But in a broader
perspective, it is clear that the looming drama of Edinburgh is really the
symptom of a profound malaise which reaches far deeper, and goes far wider,
than anything which Mr John Major could be expected to devise for good or
ill.
For what is germinating in the European Community is a three-dimensional
crisis in the true meaning of the term; a moment of truth, a decisive choice
point, and possibly a parting of the ways.
The first of these is a crisis about the relationship between the founding
member states and some of the later arrivals; the second is about the
objectives of the Community and how far the integration process can or
should go; the third is about the size of the Community, and whether it can
take in a large number of new members without a profound change in its
character and/or its constitution.
The first is really short-hand for Britain's ambivalence over the purposes
of the European Community as laid down by the original Six. Mr Major says
repeatedly that he wants Britain to be 'at the heart of Europe'; perhaps he
thinks he means it; surely he must see that it is vital for Britain's
future; but it is his misfortune that British ambivalence towards the
Community model of Europe appears to be as visceral and as uncomprehending
today as it was 35 years ago when the then British government declined to
take part in the drafting of the Treaty of Rome.
Some of the newest of today's Twelve, like Spain and Portugal, have become
almost as unconditional in their commitment to Community integration as the
Six founding members. The British, by contrast, have never liked the
integrationist Community devised by the others, and despite 20 years of
membership, they are still trying to turn it into a loose free-trade area.
This unresolved British quarrel with the European Community is now reaching
its climax in the second layer of the three-dimensional crisis, over the
Maastricht treaty. British ministers do not care to be told that their
government does not like this treaty and never has. But there is no getting
away from the fact that the British opt-out from monetary union, described
by Mr Major as a triumphant victory, is not merely a signal diminution of
the British commitment to the objectives of the treaty, but is all of a
piece with those Danish reservations which may yet bring the treaty to
grief.
British ministers consistently minimise the significance of Maastricht, in
some cases going so far as to claim that the treaty will make the Community
less federalist than it would otherwise be. And yet it is hard to reconcile
such minimalism with a treaty whose most conspicuous objectives are monetary
union and a common foreign policy.
The fate of the Maastricht treaty now depends solely on the Danes. For if
they were to get another No, in a second referendum, the British government
would abandon the attempt to ratify it in the House of Commons.
In this uncertainty, British officials talk the double language of
ambivalence. Maastricht is deeply flawed, they say, because it is
intellectually messy, because it is too ambitious in political terms, and
above all because recent events have proved that monetary union is
unworkable. And yet it is essential to ratify the treaty, because that will
avert a crisis, and we shall then be able to reach pragmatic compromises in
the real world.
But the fundamental British interest in ratifying the treaty is that it
would stave off a split in the Community, in which an inner core would move
ahead towards closer economic, monetary and political integration. British
officials are too blase about this. While France and Germany and the Benelux
would undoubtedly prefer the Community to stay together, British officials
translate such a preference into an absolute priority, claiming that France
in particular could not really tolerate a mini-Europe, which would lead to
progressive French subordination to Germany.
This analysis may prove correct; the problem is its British perspective; for
it may underestimate once again the force of the integrationist urge on the
continent, especially between France and Germany. There are obvious
drawbacks in a mini-Europe; but in the past the British have too often paid
the price for assuming that others think the same way as they do.
Finally there is the crisis of Community enlargement, which will move to the
top of the agenda if the Maastricht treaty is ratified. The conventional
wisdom is that the Community can admit new members from Efta without
changing the rules, because they are rich, developed and western European.
Only later, with a subsequent wave of new members, would it be necessary to
rewrite the treaty.
Everyone knows this is Panglossian nonsense. With 16 or 17 members,
decision-making under current arrangements would become virtually
impossible; with 25 it would cease altogether. This issue cannot be
postponed until Poland and Hungary are at the gates, because the admission
of the Finns and the Swedes will determine the institutional terms of the
next enlargement. Yet the Germans insist that enlargement is necessary, and
even the French have now started talking the same way.
The advantage of ratifying Maastricht, from a British perspective, is that
it is one way of shelving the long-standing ideological argument between the
inter-governmentalists and the federalists. The problem is that it opens the
door to what will become a very much larger Community. Such a Community
would certainly need a new constitution, and probably an explicitly federal
constitution at that.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: How ceiling fell in on UK presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST countries occupying the rotating presidency of the EC suffer abuse from
their partners; but this year the British have been in a league of their
own.
Over the past five months, UK ministers have been accused of arrogance,
ignorance and sabotage by their European colleagues; the Foreign Office  -
often viewed in Brussels as the most gifted in Europe - finds itself accused
of unprecedented partisanship. The presidency, says one EC observer, is like
a 'Rolls-Royce without a steering wheel'.
Final judgment must await the outcome of the summit. Yet even a success at
Edinburgh will not dispel the question: why has a presidency which was
launched with such high hopes on July 1 attracted such widespread abuse?
There is a respectable argument that Britain has been turned into a
'whipping boy' for all the Community's problems. One anglophile ambassador
in Brussels sums up: 'Number one, Britain did not reject the Maastricht
treaty like Denmark; number two, it did not call an unnecessary referendum
in France, like President Mitterrand; number three, it did not cause the
September crisis in the exchange rate mechanism; and number four it did not
cause the recession.' Others agree that the slowdown in growth has punctured
the EC's self-confidence and weakened political leaders across the
continent.
However tempting it is to paint Britain as a victim of events, other factors
have damaged its cause in Europe. By far the most serious is Britain's delay
in ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
After the razor-thin French approval on September 20, EC leaders thought
they had won a solid commitment from Mr John Major at the Birmingham summit
the following month to press ahead with ratification. His subsequent
concession to a handful of Tory Euro-sceptics to link final ratification of
the treaty to a second Danish referendum was greeted, in the words of an EC
ambassador, 'with total disbelief'.
Mr Major's decision - which was not discussed beforehand with his foreign
secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd - left the British delegation to the EC in
Brussels 'shell-shocked', a UK official recalls. Only days before, British
diplomats had been spreading the word that Mr Major had full cabinet support
for early ratification. 'Major's U-turn destroyed his credibility,' says an
EC diplomat. 'We asked ourselves: how can we believe what he says?'
Some, like Chancellor Helmut Kohl, were more charitable. They accepted the
prime minister's argument that the three-vote margin in the House of Commons
showed how perilously close the government had come to defeat. Others such
as Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's premier, refused to accept the argument that
it was better to make the concession than lose the treaty.
The ratification delay rekindled mistrust in EC capitals about Britain's
attitude to Maastricht, and the Community. Minor instances of ministerial
friction have suddenly become legendary examples of British perfidy.
Last month, Mr Edward Leigh, UK industry minister, unwisely refused to
support calls for further discussion of plans to spend EC money on
high-definition television. He was immediately accused of sabotage by the
Dutch, traditionally Britain's closest ally. Mr Leigh, it appears, forgot
about The Hague's eagerness to help Dutch companies such as Philips profit
from EC funding.
Sir John Cope, UK Paymaster General, is the latest bete noire. His brusque
rejection of the European parliament's additions to EC spending drew howls
of outrage; so did his peevish refusal to countenance any serious discussion
on the British budget rebate.
Similarly, EC finance ministers and central bank governors have yet to
forgive Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the Exchequer, for using the
presidency for his own ends to press Germany to cut interest rates. He
encouraged colleagues to 'gang up' on the Germans at a finance ministers'
meeting in early September.
Lastly, both diplomats and officials at the European Commission have been
infuriated by the blizzard of paper emanating from Whitehall which has tried
systematically to downgrade the Commission's role.
One EC diplomat describes British resolutions (statements of policy) on
matters such as state aid and subsidiarity (devolving decision-making) as
betraying the old habit of running everything from London.
In the past three weeks, the presidency appears to have learnt some lessons.
The UK paper on Denmark's requests for exemptions on the Maastricht treaty
drew heavily on Mr Jean-Claude Piris, the European Council's chief legal
adviser. Suspicion that the British would produce a 'soft' paper encouraging
the Danes gave way to mild surprise.
If Mr Major can secure deals on the Danish question and the EC budget, he
would confound his critics. But hopes that 1992 would see a shift in
Britain's ambivalence toward the Community have proved unrealistic. Things
might have been easier for Mr Major and the Foreign Office if they had
avoided such suggestions in the first place.

FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Paradoxes along the Maastricht road to
Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC and monetary union was the most important goal of the treaty of
European Union agreed by leaders of the European Community a year ago at
Maastricht. It is now among the least plausible.
Emu was envisaged as the last of three stages, the first of which was a
'hard' ERM, with universal coverage and few, if any, exchange rate
realignments. The ERM's current disarray may not preclude a move to some
kind of Emu by the end of the century. But it does render almost impossible
the earlier belief in the staged transition to Emu by all, or even most EC
members.
In view of its significance, it is perhaps surprising that strengthening of
the ERM will not be found on the agenda of the Edinburgh summit. This is
supposedly for fear of reviving anxiety in already fragile markets, but
probably because agreement on reform is inconceivable.
The planned path to Emu has become less credible, for three reasons.
First, the treaty has not been ratified and, following the Danish referendum
last June, may never be.
Second, even citizens of the two pivotal countries of the European Community
give far from whole-hearted support to Emu. The French voted in favour of
the Maastricht treaty by the narrowest of margins. A majority of Germans
display marked hostility to the notion of surrendering the D-Mark. The
Bundestag has insisted that it will examine whether the pre-conditions have
been met before Germany moves into any Emu.
Third and most important, after almost six years with only one technical
realignment, two major currencies - the Italian lira and the pound sterling
 -have been forced out of the ERM. The Spanish peseta has been realigned
twice and the Portuguese escudo once. Considerable pressure has also been
imposed upon the Irish punt, the Danish krone and even the French franc. The
ERM is, to the Bundesbank's delight, an adjustable peg exchange rate system
once more. Its most stable element is a D-Mark zone covering Germany, the
Benelux and Austria, which is not even a member of the Community.
Formally, this alteration in the operation of the ERM does not rule out the
Maastricht path to Emu. The treaty demands only that, prior to a decision on
whether it can be included in Emu, each currency should observe 'the normal
fluctuation margins provided for by the ERM for at least two years, without
devaluing against the currency of any other member state'. There is still
time for this requirement to be satisfied.
Nevertheless, the presumption that a hardened ERM would lead smoothly to an
EC-wide Emu has been exploded.
The ERM has gone awry because the European economy has done so. After seven
years of growth in the EC economy at 2.5 per cent a year or more, EC-wide
gross domestic product grew by only 1.3 per cent between 1990 and 1991, is
likely to grow by much the same amount between 1991 and 1992 and again
between 1992 and 1993. Community-wide unemployment has also risen, from 8.4
per cent of the labour force in 1990 to 9.8 per cent in October 1992.
There are three main reasons for the slowdown in the European economy. The
first and least important is what has happened over the past several years
to the global economy, principally to the US. The second reason is 'local
difficulties' in major EC countries, other than Germany, principally too
much private debt in the UK and too much public debt in Italy.
The third and most important reason has been German unification. A real
appreciation of the D-Mark was required, to facilitate absorption of
resources within the German economy. The mistake of the rest of the EC was
to fail to realise the implications of the Bundesbank's refusal to tolerate
higher inflation. A D-Mark realignment or, better still, temporary flotation
of the D-Mark would have been a superior method of bringing about the needed
adjustment than deflation elsewhere in Europe.
The aim of the past three years has been to harden the ERM as a step towards
an Emu that would bind Germany, both politically and economically, into a
European union. The paradoxical outcome has been to weaken the ERM and make
more probable either no Emu at all or a narrow one, totally dominated by
Germany.

FT  10 DEC 92 / UK drive to resolve Maastricht deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, LIONEL BARBER and DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN led a diplomatic drive yesterday to narrow differences on the Danish
question and the European Community budget in an effort to break the
threatened deadlock at the Edinburgh summit.
The British presidency tabled a new draft plan to meet Danish demands for
opt-outs on the Maastricht treaty and promised a revised budget package
which would channel more resources to the EC's poorer states.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, praised the draft
as 'extremely subtle' which encouraged him to believe that a solution could
be found this week, allowing a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty
next May.
In Bonn, an official said the latest British proposals amounted to 'a very
good basis for a possible solution of the problem', although there were
still 'one or two points to be watched'.
In a pre-summit letter to fellow heads of government, Mr John Major, the
prime minister, voiced optimism that governments 'share a determination to
reach agreement at Edinburgh'.
He said an agreement with Denmark would allow the Community to go ahead
together, adding that the suggested presidency declarations 'do not require
any reopening of the Maastricht treaty, nor, we believe, reratification by
member states'.
A senior EC official cautioned, however, that several member states, notably
Spain, had warned that to enshrine Danish demands in quasi-treaty form would
present constitutional problems which might require reratification of
Maastricht.
Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, said the amended British text
'goes a long way to meeting Denmark's wishes'.
'It is a much better paper than the first. The task in Edinburgh is to
achieve a solution. It will be difficult, but I think we shall succeed,' he
said.
But two of the main opposition parties behind Denmark's seven-party national
compromise continued to voice opposition.
Mr Major also offered his opposite numbers revised budget proposals. British
officials said that the plan would retain the UK presidency's suggestion
that the overall increase in Community spending be held to the limits it
outlined earlier this month.
To the fury of Spain in particular, Britain - backed by Germany - has
suggested that the maximum size of the EC budget, the so-called own
resources ceiling, should be raised to 1.25 per cent of EC gross national
product by the end of 1999. That compares with 1.2 per cent at present and
the 1.32 per cent ceiling suggested by the EC Commission.
But the officials said new adjustments to the formula - based on VAT
receipts as well as GDP - under which national governments contribute to the
EC budget, would channel more cash to Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland.
So would the allocation to poorer states of uncommitted contingency funds.
It was unclear, however, whether the poorer countries would back the UK
plan. Mr Delors seems certain to oppose it. He appealed for support for his
own financing plan, saying that a restrictive UK compromise on the budget
would emasculate the Community.
In spite of the new proposals, British ministers were last night still
voicing caution on the outcome of the summit.
The prime minister yesterday discussed how the European exchange rate
mechanism could be reformed at a private meeting with trade unionists and
European employers. Downing Street said the government was 'continuing to
look' at possible improvements to the ERM before Britain rejoined.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Regulator poised to approve power industry's dash for gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, will today give
the all-clear to the power generation industry's 'dash for gas' which is
blamed for reducing demand for coal.
After a two-month investigation, Prof Littlechild has concluded that power
from gas-fired stations is not uneconomic, and that it conforms to present
price controls.
'My review does not so far suggest that regional electricity companies have
breached their economic purchasing licence conditions,' he says in a report
to be published today.
His findings, which are still preliminary, will have a powerful influence on
the review of energy policy being conducted by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, in the wake of the crisis over pit closures.
His overall conclusion will make it hard for Mr Heseltine to blame gas for
the coal industry's problems. It also weakens the case for calling a halt to
the construction of further gas-fired power stations, many of which he has
already approved.
But Prof Littlechild's report will also provoke a strong challenge from the
coal lobby which claims to have evidence that gas is costlier than coal.
Prof Littlechild's main findings are:
The contracts which the regional electricity companies have signed with gas
stations 'appear to compare well with other contracts available'.
The contracts have added diversity to the regional electricity companies'
sources of supply.
They are also less vulnerable to environmental regulation because of the low
emissions from gas stations.
Regional companies 'looked to the future, actively seeking the most economic
and competitive sources of supply from new generators as well as existing
licensees'.
Prof Littlechild also casts doubt on claims by the coal lobby that
coal-fired plant can produce electricity for as little as 2p per unit,
compared with more than 3p for gas-fired power.
'I do not think it is realistic to expect such prices,' he says. He stresses
that his report is incomplete. He will announce further conclusions on
January 31.
The dash for gas resulted from the lifting of an EC ban on the use of gas
for power generation. Over the past two years, more than two dozen gas
projects have been announced, the first of which are now starting up. If
they are all completed, they could displace as much as 30m tons of coal a
year.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Prince Charles and Diana to separate but not divorce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRINCE and Princess of Wales are to separate, Buckingham Palace
announced yesterday, but the government said the princess could still become
Queen.
Mr John Major told MPs the decision had no constitutional implications and
there were 'no plans' for the couple to divorce. Prince Charles's succession
as head of the Church of England, which frowns on divorce, was also
unaffected.
The prime minister said: 'There is no reason why the Princess of Wales
should not be crowned Queen in due course.'
The couple's 11-year marriage had been subject to intense speculation by
newspapers, fuelled by the publication in June of a biography of the
princess by Mr Andrew Morton. Buckingham Palace said the Queen was
'saddened' by the announcement and wanted an end to the press intrusions
into the couple's lives.
The Queen believes 'a degree of privacy and understanding is essential if
their Royal Highnesses are to provide a happy and secure upbringing for
their children, while continuing to give a wholehearted commitment to their
public duties'. The prince and princess will continue to carry out public
engagements - sometimes together, as at tomorrow night's state banquet in
Edinburgh for European Community leaders.
The princess will live in Kensington Palace. The prince will stay in
Highgrove House, Gloucestershire, and, when in London, with his grandmother,
the Queen Mother, at Clarence House.
The announcement follows, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis for the
royal family - dominated by newspaper reports of marital rifts and the
behaviour of its junior members - that has stimulated debate about the
future of the House of Windsor.
After a political row over the cost of the Windsor Castle fire, the Queen
said she would pay income tax and reduce the number of publicly funded
royals.
The separation of Charles and Diana could have wider implications. If either
wanted to divorce, the question of the succession would trigger
constitutional uncertainty not seen since the abdication of King Edward VIII
in 1936.
Downing Street last night refused to comment on 'hypothetical' scenarios. Mr
Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, believes that
the prince will renounce the throne in favour of his eldest son, William.
The idea of a single-parent Queen separated from her husband was greeted
with gasps by MPs. 'There is no possibility of this working,' said Mr
Brooks-Baker.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Rowland to sell half his Lonrho stake at premium: German
financier buys 7 1/2 % holding and underwrites share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TINY ROWLAND yesterday signalled his intention to retire in three years
from Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate he has effectively run -
sometimes amid great controversy - for the past 31 years.
The 75-year-old chief executive said he would sell half his 15 per cent
stake in Lonrho to Mr Dieter Bock, a German financier, at 115p a share for a
total of Pounds 50m. The company will also be issuing shares to Mr Bock at
85p.
The price of 115p is a substantial premium to Lonrho's closing price last
night of 79p and is likely to raise the concern of the other shareholders
who are not offered such terms. Mr Bock has the option to buy the other half
after three years when Mr Rowland is expected to have retired from the
Lonrho board.
Ms Anne Simpson, joint managing director of Pension Investment Research
Consultants, which provides a corporate governance service to fund managers
handling more than Pounds 40bn of pension funds, criticised the deal.
'If Mr Rowland's shares are worth 115p then so are the shares held by all
the other shareholders,' she said. 'It is a flagrant disregard of the
understanding that all shareholders are treated equally.'
In a wide-ranging series of deals to bolster Lonrho's heavily debt laden
balance sheet, Mr Bock will partially underwrite a Lonrho rights issue and
buy further shares from the company at 85p a share.
These two actions will raise about Pounds 180m. Lonrho will also sell to
Volkswagen for Pounds 124m VAG, the UK importer of Volkswagen and Audi cars.
Mr Bock will end up owning between 9 per cent and 25 per cent of the
enlarged group, depending on the rights issue take-up of other shareholders.
Mr Bock will underwrite half the 200m shares in the 3 for 10 rights issue at
85p a share, take up Mr Rowland's rights and buy his existing shares.
Mr Rowland, in a letter to shareholders, acknowledges that there is 'bound
to be comment on the premium paid for the shares' which he is selling.
He said: 'I do not believe that there is any unfair advantage since neither
my company nor I has ever dealt in Lonrho shares, other than to buy them.'
Mr Rowland went on to tell shareholders that Lonrho had discussions with
Gencor, South Africa's second biggest mining house, but decided it was not
in Lonrho's interests to be South African controlled.
Lonrho's need to raise cash from its first rights issue in 12 years is
underlined by the fall in profit which it forecasts for the year ending
September 30.
Pre-tax profits have dropped from Pounds 205m to Pounds 79m and profits
attributable to shareholders before extraordinary items were Pounds 6m
compared with Pounds 90m.
The final dividend is to be cut to 2p, making a total of 4p compared with
13p. Net debt has risen to Pounds 947m.
Mr Bock is investing as a private shareholder although his main vehicle is
Advanta, a Dutch-based company with extensive property and construction
interests in Germany.
Speaking after signing the deal in London yesterday, Mr Bock indicated he
would take an active role at Lonrho to push through changes. It is
understood he might accept Lonrho's invitation to join the board if he was
to become joint chief executive with Mr Rowland.
To raise the money to buy his Lonrho stake, Mr Bock said he had recently
made a number of property disposals and he would sell 10 per cent to 20 per
cent of his shareholding in Advanta group to German institutions. He is
underwriting the deal through his privately owned company, Laerstate,
registered in the Netherlands.
He said that he had approached Lonrho about taking a stake because he
believed the shares were undervalued.
Lonrho's trading performance has been hurt in recent years by a number of
factors including weak prices for the output of its southern African mines
and farms. Shareholders have also been deeply concerned about the group's
rising debts and the unresolved question of who would succeed Mr Rowland.
Mr Rene Leclezio, Lonrho's chairman, said: 'The combination of all these
proposals represents an important milestone in the history of Lonrho. The
group has experienced two difficult years and there is need for decisive
action to be taken.'

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Two non-executive directors to
be appointed to Amstrad board
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the UK consumer electronics group whose shareholders meet tomorrow
to decide the fate of Mr Alan Sugar's 30p-a-share buy-out bid, has bowed to
pressure from investors and is to appoint two non-executive directors to its
board.
Yesterday, as the deadline for receipt of proxies for the group's
extraordinary meeting passed, Amstrad acknowledged that Mr Sugar's Pounds
113m (Dollars 180m) bid to take the company private again looks
'increasingly likely' to be defeated.
In a tacit admission Mr Sugar's proposals have met strong opposition, the
company said it has asked Pro Ned, the independent organisation which
promotes the role of non-executives, to draw up a shortlist of potential
candidates for the Amstrad board.
An advertisement in the Financial Times tomorrow will invite applications.
The advertisement says the first applicant 'should have sufficiently senior
experience to be able to appraise all financial aspects of the company'.
The advertisement says the second applicant, 'should be an industrialist
with a consumer product manufacturing background, or be highly experienced
in the distribution of consumer products to trade customers'.
An unusual accompanying statement says that although the advertisement has
been placed by Amstrad, 'the board wish to demonstrate their independence in
the appointment of two non-executive directors,' and have therefore
entrusted the selection of a short list to Pro Ned.
Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman and founder who has a personal 35 per cent
stake in the group, promised at the group's annual meeting last month that
if his bid failed he would appoint new non-executive directors to the board.
Since Mr Sugar made his buy-back offer, institutional investors in
particular have been extremely critical that there was no 'independent
voice' on the Amstrad board looking after minority shareholders' interests.
Mr Tim Holland-Bosworth, a director at Kleinwort Benson, Amstrad's financial
adviser, acknowledged yesterday that 'a number of institutional shareholders
had made the point' that they wanted to see non-executive directors back on
the six-member Amstrad board. Amstrad had two non-executive directors after
it became a public company in 1980, but both have since left.
Institutional investors, led by Prudential and Postel, have cited the lack
of non-executive directors and the absence of financial forecasts and other
information on Amstrad's prospects, as reasons for opposing the deal.
Amstrad's share price, which dropped 4p to 24p on Monday after it became
clear that the buy-back plan faced increasingly strong opposition, gained 1p
to close at 25p yester-day.

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN attempt to crack down on a new wave of kidnappings in Rio de Janeiro,
the Brazilian Congress is to vote this week on a project to freeze the
assets of captives' families.
An Interpol conference last week said Rio was becoming the world centre of
kidnapping. The city has a record number of 10 people in captivity, two of
whom have been held for two months, while 146 cases have been registered
this year.
Mr Mauricio Correa, the law minister, admits: 'It's like a raging epidemic.'
Multinationals, such as Land Rover, planning to invest in Brazil are
bypassing Rio as unsafe. The head of one foreign bank in Sao Paulo said:
'Five years ago we couldn't get people to move from Rio. Now, no one wants
to stay.'
Victims are usually leading businessmen or socialites, or their relations,
with the real number of kidnappings believed to be far higher than the 360
registered in the last three years. Many are not reported for fear of a
repeat.
The kidnappers are well armed, with imported weapons and cellular
telephones, and are controlled by the Red Command, the city's main organised
crime gang. Evidence is also emerging of police involvement.
Mr Sergio Quintella, a local businessman whose son was released last week on
a Dollars 330,000 ransom after 49 days in captivity, has made a public
appeal for people to come forward with information.
Some victims are starting legal action against the Rio state government for
'omission', but Mr Nilo Batista, the state security secretary, said:
'Kidnapping is one of the hardest crimes to prevent. In Italy it took 10
years to bring under control.'
It is increasingly common to see local business people accompanied by
security guards and driving battered vehicles, leaving smart cars in the
garage.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Takeshita confident he can avoid resignation
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE opposition parties yesterday went through the ritual of formally
demanding the resignation from parliament of Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former
prime minister, who has already defied two months of public demands that he
take his final political bow.
Mr Takeshita's determination to remain the elder statesman of the ruling
Liberal Democratic party reflects the ability of tainted Japanese
politicians either to ignore demands for their departure or to feign a
resignation, only to return a few months later, apparently 'purified' by the
experience.
In presenting the resignation demand to parliament, the three largest
opposition parties claimed that Mr Takeshita had brought shame to the
Japanese political system and 'damaged its international reputation' through
alleged gangster links.
It is claimed that Mr Takeshita used the good offices of a gang boss to
silence an extreme right-wing group which had mounted a 'praise to death'
campaign against him in 1987, before his selection as party president and
elevation to the prime ministership.
Having survived two sessions of testimony before parliament and secure in
the knowledge that the opposition does not have the numbers to make its
resolution stick, Mr Takeshita has told his aides that the worst of the
crisis is over, and that they should concentrate on a cabinet reshuffle
likely later this week.
He has justified his stand by arguing that 'if I resign, people will think I
am guilty', though the conflicting evidence given by himself and other LDP
officials has prompted about 70 per cent of Japanese, as measured by opinion
polls, to demand Mr Takeshita's resignation.
In private, Mr Takeshita insists he has done more for Japan than any other
MP and, regardless of the gang allegations, is entitled to a dignified exit
from politics. He also says the party owes him a large favour for his
resignation as prime minister in 1989 during the Recruit stocks-for-favours
scandal.
Mr Takeshita argues that he deserves credit for having negotiated the
introduction of a controversial consumption tax, and that his skills
contributed to the resolution of various complex bilateral disputes,
including a decade-old debate with the UK government over exports of whisky
to Japan.
While Mr Takeshita is confident he has survived, he recognises that another
term as prime minister is out of reach. Conscious of his place in political
history, he had hoped to clear his name with a scandal-free second term and
had presumed that a lack of obvious successors to Mr Miyazawa would provide
an opening.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Torture rife in Chinese jails, claims Amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRUTAL and sometimes fatal torture has become endemic in Chinese jails in
the past 10 years, although the country's law forbids it and China has
ratified the UN convention against it, Amnesty International reports today.
Amnesty says continued campaigns to crush crime and political opposition
have fuelled human rights violations, including arbitrary detention,
executions and torture. Its report details dozens of cases, some involving
women and children, beaten, shackled for months on end, given electric
shocks, and kept in dark cells too small to stand up or lie down in.
Amnesty says: 'We believe the law enforcement and justice system in China
actually foster torture'. Prisoners have few rights. Many are abused into
confessions. Amnesty accuses China of failing to provide basic safeguards to
protect prisoners. Many are held with no right of access to lawyers, and at
the mercy of police and guards.
China says it follows up cases of torture. A British human rights delegation
was told last week that 400 cases of torture were investigated in 1991,
leading to penalties against the torturers. Amnesty cites the same figure,
which it believes represents only a fraction of the real number of cases. It
urges China to protect prisoners and end the impunity many prison guards
enjoy.

</HEADLINE>

   HONG KONG, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China yesterday began three days of talks on the future of Hong
Kong and devoted the first session to a recitation of known positions about
proposals made by Governor Chris Patten for more democracy in the colony.
China urged Britain to withdraw the governor's proposals and abide by the
1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law - the
mini-constitution drafted by Beijing for Hong Kong when it reverts to
Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Mr Tony Galsworthy, Britain's representative, again offered China talks on
the proposals which envisage a broadening of the franchise in elections due
in 1995.
The latest round of talks is the 25th to be held by the Joint Liaison Group
which was set up, in accordance with the Joint Declaration, to oversee
orderly transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China. British officials do
not expect much progress to be made this week.
Mr Patten's proposals initially won widespread support in Hong Kong. That
support, however, has weakened in the face of a concerted campaign by China
to discredit the governor, and local concerns about Mr Patten's style of
leadership.
Yesterday's Economic Journal, Hong Kong's leading financial daily, carried
an editorial that was very critical of the governor's style.
George Graham adds from Washington: US President-elect Bill Clinton said
yesterday he was 'very concerned' about the mounting tension between China
and the UK over the future of Hong Kong, and hoped the US could play a 'very
constructive role in relieving those tensions.'
'I think it is clear from the activities in China in the last few years that
the Chinese desperately want to maintain the economic engine of Hong Kong. I
hope they understand they really can't maintain it unless they also maintain
a large range of personal freedom, liberty and human rights,' he told a
meeting of media executives in Washington yesterday.
Mr Clinton, who during his election campaign criticised President George
Bush for taking too gentle an attitude to Chinese human rights abuses, said
he might want to say more on the subject after he enters the White House.

   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROMANIAN nationalist mayor has banned Hungarian language posters in the
ethnically mixed Transylvanian town of Cluj.
Mr Gheorghe Funar said he had outlawed the posters which advertised a
Hungarian language theatre festival because they refer to 'Kolozsvari', the
Hungarian name for the town.
'I am the mayor of Cluj. There is no such place as Kolozsvari in Romania,'
he said.
A spokesman for the ethnic Hungarian party said the mayor's move was the
latest in a 'deliberately provocative hate campaign' against local ethnic
Hungarians who form nearly a quarter of the 330 inhabitants of the town
which was once capital of Hungarian-ruled Transylvania.
Mr Funar, who ran unsuccessfully against President Ion Iliescu in
presidential elections this year, has imposed several curbs on minority
rights.
This recently prompted Hungarians to demand limited self-rule for their
communities in Transylvania.
Romania has 1.6m ethnic Hungarians, 7 per cent of the country's population,
according to a census this year.
Transylvania, where most of the Hungarian minority live, was ruled by
neighbouring Hungary before 1918.

<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment in Czechoslovakia has more than doubled from 1991, the
central State Bank said yesterday, agencies report.
'By the year's end, we count on direct foreign investments reaching some
Dollars 1.2bn,' Czechoslovak State Bank's spokesman Mr Martin Svehla said.
Direct investments during the first three quarters of this year amounted to
Dollars 975.6m, a 61 per cent rise over 1991. 'Some 53 per cent of that sum
came in only between July and September,' Mr Svehla said. But he explained
this was the result of contracts concluded earlier in the year.
Since 1991, when a reform designed by Premier Vaclav Klaus to achieve a
speedy transition to a market economy came into effect, foreign investment
in Czechoslovakia has totalled Dollars 1.725bn.
This year, most investments were made in construction, food processing and
banking.
Leading investor countries included the US and France with last year's
biggest investor, Germany, ranking third.
Among the companies waiting to move in next year were Renault, Bosch,
Porsche and Westinghouse.
Government experts calculate next year's direct investments in the Czech
republic could amount to Dollars 1.3bn.
This year, Czechoslovakia also received some Dollars 759m in loans from the
world's leading financial institutions - the largest part, Dollars 284m from
the IMF.

<TEXT>
EMESS, the lighting and electrical accessories company, is to sell Tenby,
the electrical manufacturer and distributor, to Legrand, the French
electrical group, for Pounds 22m.
The divestment, which has to be ratified by shareholders at an extraordinary
meeting on December 23, will reduce borrowings from Pounds 38m to Pounds
16m, giving gearing of 23 per cent.
Mr Michael Meyer, chairman, said the sale would allow the company to focus
on its core businesses of consumer and commercial lighting.
The disposal has enabled Emess to introduce an employee share ownership plan
that will be used to buy back preference shares.
When an employee option is due, instead of issuing new shares, the company's
Esop will buy preference shares and convert them into ordinary shares. Emess
is intending to lend up to Pounds 3m to the Esop.
Profits before tax and extraordinary items at Tenby for the 1991 year
amounted to Pounds 2.1m. The consideration is based on 1992 trading profits
which are expected to be about Pounds 2.7m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 11th December 1992) appended to this article.
THE Customs and Excise Department has reported a big increase in inquiries
and questions from businesses trading with other EC states before the
abolition of customs frontiers at the beginning of next year.
The tariff and statistical office, which will process a new statistical form
called Intrastat, received more than 3,700 letters and telephone calls
during October and November according to internal estimates.
Nearly three quarters of the responses - about 2 per cent of all EC traders
 -appear not to have been correctly categorised according to the level of
trade that they conduct with other EC states. All those with EC imports or
exports which are valued above Pounds 135,000 a year must complete two new
forms.
The contacts have been prompted by letters sent in October to all 160,000
companies that trade with other EC member states. The letters explained the
procedures for completing the Intrastat form and the EC sales list, a second
form being introduced from the start of the year.
Officials remain confident that they can cope with the administrative
systems required to accompany the creation of the single European market on
January 1.
But the responses suggest widespread ignorance among companies of the
administrative procedures that they must comply with, and a number of
technical hitches in the classification of some of them.
Twelve per cent of respondents were not aware of what Intrastat or the sales
list were, and 43 per cent objected in principle to the idea behind them.
CORRECTION
THE FT of December 9 stated that 43 per cent of a sample of 3,700 traders
contacting the tariff and statistical office of HM Customs &amp; Excise had
objected to Intrastat, the new trade statistics system. This should have
said 43 businesses.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Asylum appeals plan to be diluted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night bowed to pressure from Tory backbenchers by
agreeing to water down proposals which would remove the current right of
appeal for relatives of British residents refused entry into Britain for
short visits, David Owen writes.
Under the revised plan - to be set out in the Asylum and Immigration Appeals
Bill in standing committee - those refused a visa to visit Britain for up to
six months are to receive a detailed notice explaining why entry papers have
been refused.
Applicants would then have the option of submitting a fresh application
containing new information designed to address the initial problems. A
refusal would not prejudice any subsequent application which would be
considered 'whenever possible' by a different entry clearance official.
Reasserting the government's commitment to the removal of appeal rights for
short-term visitors and students, Mr Charles Wardle, Home Office minister,
said he recognised that measures were needed to 'ensure that the small
proportion of would be visitors who at present succeed in their appeals are
not disadvantaged.'
Mr Graham Allen, a Labour frontbench spokesman, dismissed the change as
'totally bogus' and 'a cosmetic exercise'.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton yesterday expressed doubts about the strength
of the US recovery and said he would press ahead with the economic programme
he outlined during the presidential campaign.
'There is no evidence that we are really coming out of this in a traditional
sense,' he said, holding up a chart showing that jobs and output had grown
more slowly in this recovery than in previous economic upturns.
Speaking on Capitol Hill, he indicated he had not yet decided whether a
fiscal stimulus would be needed next year. He said he intended to focus on
measures to strengthen the economy's long-term performance.
'I based my whole campaign on my absolute conviction that the fundamental
economic problems of this country are long-term problems that have been 20
years in the making.'
The issue of whether to provide a short-term stimulus was of minor
importance compared with long-run challenges, which included controlling
health care costs, reducing budget deficits and improving education and
training.
Mr Clinton was responding to speculation in financial markets and in
Washington that signs of faster growth had made campaign promises to
revitalise the economy redundant. He said everything he had advocated as a
short-term stimulus for the economy was consistent with what was needed in
the longer run.
He hinted there would be little, if any, net stimulus in terms of a larger
deficit. 'If you go back to my plan, I paid for everything in the first
year. I believe there's a difference between consumption and investment. So
I always thought I was stimulating the economy by changing the nature of
spending from consumption to investment, because I think that creates a lot
more jobs.'

<TEXT>
FACES blackened, automatic weapons stowed in waterproof kit bags, crack US
commandos stormed into Somalia early today and quickly overcame their first
major hurdle - reporters and cameramen.
Scores of newsmen, tipped off by the US Defence Department where to be and
when, lay in waiting when the first Navy special forces or Seals came ashore
in motorised kayaks.
Since the operation had first been disclosed, there had been fears Somalia's
rag-tag militias might attack the troops as they came ashore.
It didn't happen. The Seals waded ashore in full view of the American
television networks, several of whom screened the event live during prime
ratings time.
At times, the landing bordered on the farcical.
'Excuse me, you've dropped your watch,' a reporter called after a burly
commando as he headed off down the darkened beach to dig a foxhole and lie
in wait.
The commando did not have to wait very long for something to happen. Soon,
about 50 reporters gathered around him with portable television arc lights
laying bare his supposedly concealed position.
He said nothing. He didn't answer questions. He just squatted in his foxhole
and tried not to look embarrassed.
Similar scenes were repeated up and down Mogadishu beach as reporters and
cameramen sought out others in a vanguard force of 1,800 US marines landing
before dawn.
It was one of the worst-kept secrets in military history. The US defence
department tipped off reporters in Washington that it would take place at
the port and airport early today.
Shortly before midnight, hordes of journalists converged on the two
installations, some stiffened with a little liquor against the possibility
of a suicide attack by gunmen.
They didn't have to wait very long at Mogadishu's so-called international
airport, which is adjacent to the beach.
In a sign of the military's concern that the media attention could be
disrupting operations, the Pentagon rushed out an advisory after the initial
landing, appealing for journalists and cameramen to stay off Mogadishu's
beaches.
A CBS television spokesman said they also had got a request from the
Pentagon not to use camera lights because it was interfering with the
troops' night vision equipment.

SOUTH AFRICA'S two mining giants - Anglo American and Gencor - have
confirmed that they will be proceeding with their R3.5bn (Dollars 1.1bn)
joint venture stainless steel project.
Construction of the plant, about 120km east of Johannesburg, will start in
January.
The project is a joint venture between Anglo and Gencor and the Industrial
Development Corporation who will be equal equity partners.
The expansion will quadruple South Africa's stainless steel capacity to
500,000 tonnes a year.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Investigation could lead to
recall of 5m GM trucks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A US federal government agency yesterday launched an investigation into the
safety of pick-up trucks made by General Motors which could eventually lead
to the costly recall of nearly 5m of the vehicles.
The action by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration follows
complaints from consumer groups that the trucks, made by GM between 1973 and
1987, have unsafe petrol tanks. The tanks are fitted outside the vehicle's
heavy steel frame and are alleged to be vulnerable to rupture if the truck
is hit from the side.
Ms Marion Blakey, administrator of the NHTSA, said the investigation did not
mean the agency had decided there was a safety defect, but further analysis
was required.
There are some 4.7m of the trucks on the road and a recall to correct any
safety problems would be extremely costly for GM when it is struggling to
regain profitability.
The company has defended the safety of the vehicles but it suffered a
setback last week when the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said the
trucks had 'an unnecessarily high risk of fire'.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Whitecroft Pounds 0.73m loss better than
expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITECROFT, the Cheshire mini-conglomerate which has slimmed down to three
core businesses, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 727,000 for the half year
to September 30, compared with profits of Pounds 2.23m.
That was better than expected, but the company is sticking to its decision
to pass its interim dividend, announced a few days before the end of the
period, when it forecast losses of about Pounds 1m. A decision on the final
dividend will be taken in June.
The improvement over forecast was the result of revaluation of Whitecroft's
pension fund, which actuaries said would be adequately funded at company
contributions of Pounds 600,000 a year, compared with Pounds 1.3m
previously.
The figure was struck after interest charges of Pounds 1.63m (Pounds
164,000). In previous years these were largely charged against property
development and did not appear in the profit and loss account.
Turnover fell 4.6 per cent to Pounds 60.19m (Pounds 63.1m) for trading
profits down 62 per cent to Pounds 904,000 (Pounds 2.39m).
Mr Peter Goold, chairman, said the group's two years of restructuring were
now largely complete, with Pounds 3.6m of capital spending in the last six
months, substantial cutting of the cost base and a reduction in numbers of
operating units from 30 to 15. Losses per share were 2.89p, compared with
earnings of 3.25p.
The payroll was 1,900, compared with 2,500 a year ago and more than 3,000
when Mr Goold became chairman late in 1990. He said marked improvements in
cash flow and profitability were expected from January.
Gearing is 102 per cent and shareholders' funds declined Pounds 6.5m to
Pounds 38.6m because of the loss and disposal of the group's double-glazing
businesses.
Whitecroft now has lighting, doors and medical cotton fibres divisions, all
of which are trading profitably.

Tangible capital ratio was 7.18 per cent, more than double the federal 3 per

FT  09 DEC 92 / Rowland set to dilute Lonrho stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, is close to signing a deal which
will result in a significant dilution of the 15 per cent stake held by Mr
Tiny Rowland, its 75-year-old chief executive.
The deal, which may be announced today, is understood to involve a rights
issue to raise cash for the group, which has net debt of around Pounds 850m.
Mr Mike Smith, conglomerate analyst at Fleming Securities, said: 'There is a
strong indication in the market that suggests that Mr Tiny Rowland is about
to dilute his stake and may eventually sell it to a German financier.
'However, whoever gets hold of Mr Rowland's stake may not necessarily end up
in control of Lonrho. There are a number of other companies which are very
interested in the group.'
The shares yesterday closed 1p higher at 74p, with 1.3m shares traded during
the day on market rumours of the impending deal.
Genting, the Far Eastern group, has built up a 7.3 per cent stake in Lonrho,
and analysts believe it may be interested in the group's hotels and casinos.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman of Gencor, South Africa's second-largest
mining group, recently told analysts that he was interested in Lonrho's
platinum and coalmining interests in South Africa, and its 45 per cent stake
in the Ashanti gold mine in Ghana.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ailing petrochemical industry may be offered fiscal incentives to
encourage rationalisation, writes Paul Abrahams.
A strong possibility exists that tax exemptions, interest-free loans and
other incentives could be offered to the industry in an effort to help
restructuring, said Mr Hajime Furuta, director of the basic chemicals
division of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Restructuring was needed because the Japanese petrochemicals industry was
weak and uncompetitive, added Mr Furuta, in London for the Financial Times
conference on petrochemicals. The plight of the Japanese industry, the
world's second largest after that of the US, with an annual turnover of
nearly Dollars 65bn was worse than in the last recession 10 years ago.
Consumer demand seemed saturated and the inventory adjustment would last
longer than during the last recession. Raw material prices were lower this
time.
The industry had severe structural problems because of excessive
competition. The sector was highly fragmented, with 12 ethylene
manufacturers. The largest had 12 per cent of the market and the smallest 6
per cent. Alliances and other forms of co-operation were needed with both
domestic and foreign partners.
In the scramble for market share, excess capacity had been built up. Annual
Japanese production next year would be 7.3m tonnes, while demand would be 6m
tonnes.
The industry's profits last year had already fallen 45 per cent to under
Dollars 80m.

FT  09 DEC 92 / US troops land in Somalia at start of aid effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US NAVY commandos came ashore on Somali beaches before dawn today to begin
the biggest foreign military and humanitarian operation ever undertaken in
Africa.
The landings, televised live worldwide, pave the way for a US-led
multinational intervention force of at least 35,000 troops, including 28,000
Americans. There was no shooting and the biggest obstacles troops faced were
hordes of reporters and cameramen.
In Washington, president-elect Bill Clinton indicated that the troops might
stay in Somalia after his inauguration on January 20, the target date set by
President George Bush for the operation to end. He said there was 'merit' in
the UN-authorised intervention - to disarm local warlords and ensure food
aid reaches the starving - and added: 'An artificial timetable cannot be
imposed.'
The first Americans to come ashore on a Mogadishu beach were frogmen,
closely followed by marine reconnaissance forces in rubber boats.
The commandos walked up the beach and shook hands with a contingent of
Pakistani UN troops who have camped nearby for the past few months. Advance
units of Marines also landed at Mogadishu airport.
US Marines in armoured amphibious tractors from the USS Juneau then set
about establishing beachheads for further landings by some 1,800 troops,
backed by attack helicopters.
The troops planned to move quickly to disarm local gunmen who have been
thwarting the international operation to get humanitarian aid to starving
Somalis.
Scores of reporters and photographers were at the port and airport as the
troops moved in, and the first landings were televised live at prime viewing
time in the US via satellite dishes.
Reporters even tried to interview troops as they headed up the beach and
cameramen with portable arc lights televised commandos as they squatted
self-consciously in hastily found foxholes.
Mogadishu's residents were tense and anxious last night ahead of the
landings. There was a slight upsurge of wild firing of guns as heavily armed
vehicles continued moving out of the city.
Somalia's two top warlords broadcast appeals urging their fighters to
co-operate with US forces and withdraw their 'Mad Max' vehicles - converted
armoured desert jeeps - from the rubble-strewn streets of the capital.
Mr Robert Oakley, US ambassador at large, met the two warlords controlling
the capital and said he recognised that neither man had full control over
the bands of marauding gunmen who speed around the city and could still
create problems for US troops.
Aid agencies ordered their staff to stay at home in case they got caught in
crossfire or became targets of kidnappings by gunmen who face the loss of
their racketeering way of life.
An advance party of French troops was also expected to arrive early today in
Mogadishu.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT year Dino Abbrescia will celebrate 10 years at Monte Titoli, Italy's
centralised securities custody organisation. He joined soon after operations
began, and has enjoyed a busy decade, helping Monte Titoli settle down into
a smooth routine.
Mr Abbrescia, a 57 year-old Milanese, had filled a knapsack full of
experience in securities trading and treasury operations at Monte dei Paschi
di Siena and the Istituto Centrale Banche e Banchieri before taking up the
challenge at Monte Titoli, where he is general manager.
'There were real headaches at the beginning. Serious giuridical (legal)
issues had to be resolved and enormous user resistance overcome,' says Mr
Abbrescia. 'Eventually, legislation enacted in 1986 settled interpretive
differences about Monte Titoli's corporate nature. It is a service operation
not a fiduciary company.'
While unpicking the knots of Monte Titoli's legal status, Mr Abbrescia was
also trying to encourage participation by securities issuers and dealers.
'It needed an exhaustive and exhausting propaganda campaign of seminars,
conferences, debates and meetings to convince potential users to switch to
this unknown service.'
Mr Abbrescia notes that when he started at Monte Titoli only 40 securities
issuers used the service. Now there are nearly 300. 'A lot of credit should
be given to Fiat and Pirelli who were early, strong supporters,' he says.
Equally important in the struggle to win acceptance for Monte Titoli was the
Bank of Italy, an institution well-known for its powers of moral persuasion.
It firmly encouraged Italy's banks to transfer their securities custody
activities to Monte Titoli.
'Fewer than 50 banks were users of Monte Titoli 10 years ago; today there
are nearly 200. Their reluctance was understandable. Not only were our
services unknown, but banks also faced the need to review their internal
procedures and modify their data processing in order to switch to us,'
explains Mr Abbrescia.
Concern about costs also played a part in deterring brokers and banks from
using Monte Titoli. 'Small brokerage firms particularly were worried that
the costs would weigh excessively on their operations, and affect relations
with clients. But the charges made by Monte Titoli have been much lower than
the costs that users would otherwise have incurred,' claims Mr Abbrescia.
Monte Titoli's general manager says that, while all the principal problems
of centralised securities custody in Italy have been resolved, new factors
will always appear and changes in markets will call for modifications to the
service. For some changes, Monte Titoli is already prepared. 'If cash
settlement were to be introduced today we could handle it tomorrow.'
This raises memories of the mid-1980s, when settlement of Italian securities
transactions seemed an unreachable goal for many foreign investors. 'Such
complaints are not made today,' says Mr Abbrescia, noting that cross-border
transactions are an issue under study. Maintaining regular contact with
counterparts abroad, he would quickly be aware if matters were going wrong.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (14): User satisfaction - David
Lane on Monte Titoli's successful formula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Monte Titoli ranks high among the world's most efficient custodians.
'We are very happy with Monte Titoli's service. No problems, and no real
complaints,' says Paolo Azzoni, of Milan securities intermediation company,
Gamba Azzoni Sim.
A similar view comes from Renzo Noris, who heads the securities service at
Banca Commerciale Italiano (BCI). 'Monte Titoli has proved a great benefit
to banks. BCI used to have securities custody at 150 branches. But the cost
was very high, in terms of space, staff and physical security. We have
obtained significant savings.'
Paolo Basilico, of Milan's Giubergia Warburg Sim, says: 'Monte Titoli works
smoothly and efficiently.' He adds that centralised securities custody
greatly assists his company's work, and also keeps costs down. 'Though Monte
Titoli could be less expensive, we incurred even greater costs before,
particularly with items like insurance premiums and delivery.'
This seeming paragon was established in February 1978, and became
operational four years later. Monte Titoli encountered difficulties at the
beginning, however, and growth was held back in early years. It was only
after enactment of Law 289 in June 1986, which clarified the giuridical
(legal) position of securities custody, that the organisation was able to
start developing its full potential.
The 1986 law defines Monte Titoli, a joint stock corporation, as an
institution for the centralised custody and administration of securities.
Its sole objective is the provision of services aimed at rationalising
securities custody and negotiation.
Shareholdings in Monte Titoli are limited to a small number of permitted
categories; banks, active stockbrokers, securities intermediary companies
and similar organisations abroad, on the basis of reciprocity. New articles
of association, approved in July, restrict the total stake held by
stockbrokers to 12.5 per cent of share capital, while the limit for foreign
organisations and securities intermediation companies is a total of 10 per
cent for each category.
No single shareholding must exceed 7 per cent, with one exception: the Bank
of Italy, on which no limits are placed. Indeed, the central bank has a 42.3
per cent stake in Monte Titoli's L16bn (Dollars 11.77m) share capital, and
the company's results are shown in the Bank of Italy's own financial
statements.
Should shares or options in new issues not be taken up, shareholders may
offer them only to the Bank of Italy. That it has a central role in Monte
Titoli is further underlined by its statutory right to appoint a member of
the board of directors.
Clearly, Italy's centralised securities custody organisation is more than an
ordinary joint stock corporation. 'Recognition by specific legislation as a
service of public utility gives Monte Titoli a special standing,' says
general manager Dino Abbrescia.
'Theoretically, there could be competition, but not in practice,' notes Mr
Abbrescia. Monte Titoli's official status has brought strong support from
state bodies such as its main shareholder and the companies and stock market
commission Consob, and has resulted in an impregnable market position. 'No
newcomer could compete on cost, and it would not be able to find business.'
Mr Abbrescia says that, given the practice of majority shareholders and
members of control syndicates to hold their shares, the quantity of
registered shares and similar securities that are deposited with the
organisation is about 92 per cent of those that could be realistically
centralised. Statistics show that, based on nominal value, 38 per cent of
registered shares and similar instruments were held by Monte Titoli at the
end of last year.
In the case of bearer shares and similar securities, 68 per cent of the
total nominal value was deposited with Monte Titoli, while the figure for
bonds was 83 per cent. Significant progress has been made for both; figures
at the end of 1990 were 58 per cent and 74 per cent respectively.
Monte Titoli's service is voluntary, in that owners of securities are not
obliged to deposit them. Italy's system permits those who want to hold their
securities to do so. Indeed, last year the number of operations of
certificate withdrawal from Monte Titoli rose, from 9,500 to 13,000 in the
case of shares and from 1,600 to 3,800 in the case of bonds.
However, in favour of paperless work, there was a significant increase from
260 to 286 in the number of securities issuing bodies and companies that
registered with Monte Titoli last year. At the same time the number of
securities admitted to custody rose from 947 to 945. Mr Abbrescia notes that
this was due principally to a ruling by Consob which compelled the reticent
to come into line.
Statistics for the face value of securities held by Monte Titoli at year-end
show rapid growth. Ten years ago, Italy's centralised custody organisation
held securities with a face value of L706bn. By 1987 the figure had risen to
L46,516bn, and at the end of last year it was L97,668bn. It now totals more
than L100,000bn.
The increase in the number of Monte Titoli's users has been such that often
there are no physical exchanges in the daily settlement of transactions in
the Bank of Italy's settlement rooms. From 460 at the end of 1990, the
number of users (banks, stockbrokers, securities intermediation companies,
commission houses and issuers) increased to 460 at the end of last year and
passed the 500 mark early this year.
However, Monte Titoli is more than a custody service. It administers the
securities it holds, dealing with rights issues and dividend payments.
'Rights issues highlight the benefits that Monte Titoli offers the system,'
says Mr Basilico. 'In the past these operations created considerable
difficulties for the banks. Monte Titoli manages easily, as the recent RAS
issue showed.'
Payment of dividends is another service handled. Last year this concerned
15.1bn registered and bearer securities for a total net dividend value of
L1,731bn. The figures in 1990 were 14.1bn securities and L2,177bn.
The addition of securities quoted on Italy's USM will provide new volumes,
and so also will Italy's privatisation process which will bring some new
names to the main board.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (16): Tailor-made systems - Alan
Cane discusses information technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFORMATION technology makes modern global custody services possible at an
economic price. Without efficient data transmission, processing and
electronic document interchange to keep track of share certificates and
dividend payments and to ensure that currencies are translated accurately,
global custodians would be forced to rely on telex and manual processing;
time-consuming, costly and prone to errors.
Against this must be set the substantial investment in computers and
computer software which serious players have to make; software packages
running on personal computers may cost tens of thousands of dollars but for
a large system running on a mainframe computer, the base price is several
million dollars. Banks writing their own bespoke software will be able to
create systems tailored to their exact needs and such developments are never
cheap.
Lloyds Bank in the UK, for example, is one of those developing its own
system; it is using ACT's Quasar investment management package as the basis
for its development. It will say little about the functions its system will
support or about its progress, arguing that other custodians could gain
useful insights from such information. Its reluctance to give anything away
speaks volumes for the level of competition in the market today.
The development of computer systems for global custody is following the
pattern established for most financial software over the past three decades.
In the beginning, banks developed their own systems either on their own or
with the assistance of a software house. Some of these developments proved
robust and flexible enough to be packaged and sold to other institutions.
Now a new generation of products is emerging based on 'open systems'
principles. Open software obeys industry standards, enabling it to run on a
wide range of standard hardware; a typical advantage in open systems
software is the graphical user interface (gui); computer operations are
indicated on the screen by small pictures rather than by text.
There are also developments in ways of connecting customers to their
custodians which are reminiscent of the vogue for treasurer's workstations a
decade ago. There are three basic approaches. The simplest is a dumb
terminal which can be connected through a dial-up link to the custodian's
computer. This allows portfolio inspection, but not much more.
The next stage is to download data from the custodian's system to the
customer's personal computer; this makes possible more elaborate reports and
instructions to be transmitted. The final sophistication is a direct
computer to computer connection which essentially gives the customer
privileged access direct to the custodian's computer system. Typically, the
customer will use a personal computer or workstation; guis make the process
of interaction that much easier.
The trend among global custodians is towards packaged software rather than
systems written in-house, reflecting both costs and the flexibility which
can be built into packages through modular and parameter-driven
construction.
There are now some 40 packages which run on specific manufacturers' hardware
and almost as many open systems offerings.
The leading proprietary packages include VSPS, developed by Vista Concepts
of the US, Omni GS from Dyatron, Fundmaster from BIS and Paladign, written
by Clarke and Tilley in the UK.
Leading open systems packages include GSM also from the Dyatron stable,
Synopsis from RIMS and Belvedere GPS, developed by Belvedere Europe.
VSPS from Vista Concepts is the market leader in top-of-the-line systems. It
costs typically from Dollars 1m to Dollars 10m. It is an on-line system
offering multicurrency, multilingual real-time processing. Data need only be
entered once. It deals with clearing, settlement and customer reporting.
Newer features include provisions for handling a variety of new financial
instruments together with advanced portfolio reports and money management.
But a principal advantage, according to Vista Concepts' founder Bill Potter
is its flexibility. It can be modified to suit individual customers's needs.
For this reason, it has been chosen as the basis of Taurus, the London Stock
Exchange's much delayed settlement system. According to Mr Potter, The Vista
Concept's team is on time with its share of the development work.
VSPS grew out of a project commissioned by the Banque National de Paris; now
it is used by Citibank and Chase Manhattan in the US and Midland Bank in the
UK.

<TEXT>
CUSTODIANS do not enjoy talking about how they generate revenues and are
circumspect when asked to give details of fees charged. But it is clear that
to survive, global custodians must find ways of earning fees in addition to
those paid directly by clients.
Indeed, a recent study of the global custody business by management
consultants Booz Allen, concluded that 50 to 60 per cent of custodians'
revenues come from the fees they charge clients. An additional 20 to 30 per
cent come from net interest income on client balances and 10 to 20 per cent
from foreign exchange trading and other transactions.
How custodial banks are able to do this is worth examining, particularly by
UK and European clients who tend to rely on relationship banking and do not
shop around for the best deal like their US counterparts.
First, foreign exchange transactions offer many excellent opportunities for
banks to earn extra revenue. For example, a US pension fund as a customer
wishing to purchase securities on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange has to
transmit cash through its global custodian to a sub-custodian who then
purchases D-Marks. Some custodians, such as Barclays, execute all foreign
exchange orders through their own dealing systems, although Barclays says it
always seeks the best dealing rate. Still, the bank will earn a turn on the
dealing spread between the bid and the offered rate, helping to cut its
overall costs.
In minor currencies, particularly those in emerging markets, obtaining
interest on foreign currency accounts can cause problems and only the most
insistent clients are likely to get the best rates. Mr Jeremy Paulson-Ellis,
chairman of Genesis Fund Management which specialises in emerging markets,
says his agreements with custodians allow him to deal away from them when
the rates are not the best on offer.
While awaiting settlement, the cash will sit in an account. If the client is
not careful, interest may not accrue or it may not accrue at a commercial
rate. The custodian bank, however, may earn a turn by putting that cash into
the money markets unless the client agreement specifically offers cash on
all balances.
Finally, there is what is known as 'fail float'. This occurs when bargains
are struck but for one reason or another, the stock is not delivered and the
cash is not paid. According to an executive at one leading US global
custodian, most clients pay funds from the official settlement date, not the
actual. In particularly inefficient markets, banks may have free use of
client funds for days, even weeks, and the client earns no return.
Indeed, says Mr Richard Foster, a partner in Booz Allen, a smoothly running
clearing, settlement and payments system is not necessarily profitable for
banks. 'Thirty per cent of revenues of commercial banks come from interest
income. They do not have an interest in seeking more efficient cash
management.'
For some custodians, particularly the investment banks which have a large
stockbroking and market-making operation, the driving force for entering the
global custody business is stock lending, said Mr Foster. Having the
securities in-house in their custody department guarantees them ready access
to securities needed for delivery to their own clients on the stockbroking
side. And, while clients receive typically a fee equal to half a per cent of
the value of the transaction, returns to the custodian can be far greater.
'For the investment banks, it is securities lending that is driving them
into the custody business,' Mr Foster said.
Some custodians admit that stock lending is a significant source of revenue.
One US bank described an agreement with a public pension fund client with
more than Dollars 9bn under management. As long as the bank is allowed to
lend the client's stock, the custodial service is free. When stock lending
dries up, the fees rise to Dollars 400,000 to Dollars 500,000 a year.
Mr John Morris, head of European investor services at Citibank, said his
organisation favours the use of a simple tariff with two elements: one is a
per-transaction charge and the other is one based on the value of the
portfolio and covers all transactions in a given period. However, Mr Morris
concedes that some customer anxieties about the lack of fee transparency do
have some basis. 'Sometimes fees are difficult to track and charges from
sub-custodians are passed on to the customer,' he said. It may not be clear
to clients exactly how much they are being charged for each transaction or
whether the fee they are charged bears any relation to the sub-custodians'
cost.
Mr Michael Robarts, managing director at Fleming Investment Management, said
he prefers an arrangement known as 'contractual settlement' in which the
client pays for securities bought and receives cash for securities sold on
the day of contract. If the counterparty fails to hold up the other end of
the bargain, the custodian either must lend the cash to the client or is
allowed to receive the benefit of unused cash.
ALTHOUGH global custodians have diversified, it is still the ability to
settle trades in a timely fashion which clients rate as the most significant
aspect of the business. More than 90 per cent of all types of fund managers
rank the provision of basic settlement services as crucial to their choice
of custodian. Also, the quality of information systems and responsiveness to
clients rank high.
Significantly, securities lending, perhaps the most attractive aspect of the
global custody business for some of the new entrants, is still a relatively
insignificant service. Fewer than 30 per cent of all clients find it of any
importance at all.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (11): Jigsaw of different systems -
Richard Waters explores the dream of a global electronic link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DREAM: global electronic links between institutional investors, brokers
and custodians which will reduce the costs of securities dealing and shorten
settlement times.
The reality: a complicated jigsaw of different systems in which not all of
the pieces fit together, contributing to higher costs and risks for the
securities industry.
That, at least, is the present position. But to judge by two initiatives
launched in the past year, the dream may be getting much nearer.
The ETC (Electronic Trade Confirmation) project in Europe and ISITC
(Industry Standardisation for Institutional Trade Communications) in the US
are both co-operative ventures to promote common standards in the way trades
are confirmed and settled. Finding a way for these two separate ventures to
co-operate will be the next challenge in developing a single international
network.
'A lot of banks and institutions have spent a lot of money on systems - and
good systems at that,' says Mr Alistair Reid of Morgan Grenfell. 'The weak
point is when they try to transfer information outside their own
organisations. The next level of efficiency is to get systems that speak to
each other.'
ISITC was formed by a group of investors and custodian banks in the US to
promote common standards for communications between the two groups. For the
custodians, this marks a considerable shift in strategy.
Most have invested heavily in proprietary systems in recent years, enabling
investors to communicate with them directly. These links have helped to tie
investors to particular custodians, protecting the custodians' income.
Common standards could undermine these proprietary systems, forcing banks to
write off their investments while at the same time making it easier for
investors to shop around to reduce the fees they are paying.
Custodians admit that there has been a lot of soul-searching over this
development. However, they seem to have decided to make the best of it -
perhaps out of a desire not to repeat the rearguard action fought to keep
fund managers out of Swift, the international financial messaging sytem,
until recently.
Also, the development of common standards may have only a limited impact on
custodians' business, at least in its early years.
Investors with links to a small number of custodians are likely to maintain
those connections, since there is no advantage to them changing, says Mr
Sean Quinn, client technical services manager of Chase Manhattan in London.
He adds that investors which use a larger number of custodians are generally
communicating by facsimile or telex, so common standards for electronic
systems could help both sides by making communication more efficient.
Also, existing bank systems can be adapted to fit the new standards being
developed by the ISITC working group and will not have to be scrapped.
Europe's own industry-wide electronic trade confirmation project has also
raised questions about the future relationship between different groups of
intermediaries in the securities markets. ETC is designed to link investors
and brokers, making it possible for them to confirm trades automatically.
Potentially, though, it could provide the basis for an order-matching system
on which institutions could trade directly with each other.
While the ISITC project is aimed only at developing common standards, ETC
has led to the selection of three commercial vendors to provide systems
which meet standards selected by a representative group of users: the London
Stock Exchange, the International Securities Market Association and Thomson
Financial Networks. The intention: for links to be built between the three,
making it possible for an institution which uses one of the systems to
confirm a trade with a broker who uses another.
For now, the backers of ETC say they have more important things on their
plate than extending their project to take in trade confirmation.
'Order-matching is not a current intention,' says Mr Reid of Morgan
Grenfell. 'It's still a back office project.'
The development of this common infrastructure to support back office
operations has not always run smoothly. The Stock Exchange, for instance,
has recently appeared to cool to the idea of linking its Sequal trade
confirmation system to Isma's Trax and Thomson's Oasys. Pressure from users
appears now to have changed its mind.
There is also the danger that the ETC and ISITC developments will tread on
each others' toes. Backers of the US project have begun talks for a similar
venture in Europe. The supporters of ETC are not enamoured: Mr Chris Smith
of Fidelity, one of the instigators of ETC, believes the two projects should
be developed by the same group of users.
'I really am concerned it (the separate ISITC development) will get in the
way,' he says. He would rather it was developed by the same industry user
group which has promoted ETC.
Supporters of ISITC agree there is a danger of duplication. 'Too many people
are setting up to be standards bodies,' says Mr Quinn of Chase. He adds,
though, that the ETC group already has its hands full at the moment.
The initial rivalry is likely to give way to closer co-operation in future.
Formal talks between institutions involved on each project are already
planned, with a view to promoting electronic links between investors and
their custodians in Europe.
Unscrambling the jumble of systems in this way should help to bring
settlement times down towards the three days envisaged by the G30. As yet,
though, it is still more of a dream than a reality.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (12): Move to join Swift is slow -
Barry Riley examines the electronic bank payments system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE THE leading investment management houses reluctant, like Groucho Marx,
to join the type of club that would be willing to have them as members?
Technology, in a tantalising way, is beckoning the investment management
industry. A few high-powered personal computers or work stations with the
right software and the right interfaces may be all that is needed to wrest
control of important aspects of the trading and settlement process from the
exchanges, the brokers and the custodian banks. The jurisdictional
boundaries may need to be redrawn, but exactly where should they be
inserted?
Such battles are being fought in various centres, but in the UK a key area
of dispute has been over access by fund managers to the banks' international
communications network Swift, which stands for Society for Worldwide
Interbank Financial Telecommunications.
For several years fund managers fought to gain access to Swift but were
rebuffed. In June 1991 just 68 per cent of the system's members voted to
allow non-bank investment institutions into the system, a small margin short
of the 75 per cent majority required for this constitutional change.
Some institutions had hoped to use the Swift messaging network to confirm
international securities transactions. 'Frustration was felt by many fund
managers.
The Swift system already existed and it would have been much easier to use
that system,' says Mr Jonathan Rashleigh, finance director of Legal &amp;
General Investment Management.
The rejection triggered proposals by fund managers to find alternatives. An
industry user group of institutions and brokers was set up late in 1991 to
specify electronic trade confirmation (ETC) products which are now almost
ready for the market place. The participants were mostly British but the
bigDutch investment group Robeco was involved, and a number of Continental
brokers and banks are likely to install the new systems.
In the meantime, however, Swift has changed its mind. In June this year the
banks voted 95 per cent in favour of letting the outsiders in, arguing that
the upgrading of systems had made expansion more practical. Privately,
however, some of the banks admit that their earlier opposition may have been
rather short-sighted. Perhaps some of the fears that big fund managers might
side-step the custodian banks have faded, or perhaps the debate has anyway
moved on.
This has been a complicated area because some of the big investment
management operations have in any case been part of large bank-owned groups,
and through in-house custodians have had indirect access to Swift. But no
more than about 3 per cent of Swift transactions are thought to have been
related to securities deals, and new formats might have had to be developed
to suit the requirements of investment institutions.
The position now is that some of the big non-bank investment institutions
are considering Swift and are likely to join, but there is no lengthy queue
at the admissions office.
'We will evaluate Swift fully,' says Mr Chris Smith, who is in charge of the
middle office at Fidelity in London. 'You need to go into it with your eyes
open. It's not a panacea.'
Mr Jonathan Rashleigh at L &amp; G is also considering Swift. 'We are certainly
quite attracted to the prospect,' he says. 'My bet is that a number of the
larger players will join, but it is not going to be a landslide.'
The question is whether many institutions will think it is worth stumping up
the substantial cost of joining Swift when cheaper trade confirmation
alternatives are becoming available. They will need to see a substantial
scope for using Swift to communicate with their custodian banks rather than
with their brokers.
Meanwhile the ETC systems are all but ready, and will be good enough for the
requirements of many of the smaller and medium-sized investment managers.
Some argue that if fund management houses had been given access to Swift
earlier and could have used it for confirming international securities
transactions other systems might not have been required.
Essentially the problem has been in coping with inefficiencies in overseas
securities transactions. These are more difficult to handle than domestic
trades, information on which is sent out by the London Stock Exchange by
computer every night, so that any mismatches can be spotted next morning.
However, when it comes to cross-border transactions a significant percentage
go wrong, and up to 10 per cent may not settle on the normal day. This can
in itself be expensive. In addition the whole process is being given
momentum by the pressure from the Group of 30 which is trying to push stock
exchanges around the world to adopt a three-day settlement standard.
In the case of trade confirmation fund managers still have to cope with
archaic methods such as telexes, faxes or letters, which introduce delays of
24 hours or more. Along with delays go increased risks of losses from failed
transactions because misunderstandings and errors are not picked up quickly.
Therefore strong pressures have developed for the introduction of compatible
systems which can achieve instant electronic information transfer using
standard formats. In practice the new ETC networks should be capable of
providing trade confirmation within minutes of the order being placed.
Mr Sean Quinn of Chase in London argues that the new electronic
communications will substantially improve efficiency. 'At present there can
be quite a lot of toing and froing before we get our instructions,' he says.
'We have to wait until investors and banks have agreed their transactions.'
At SG Warburg Mr Gordon Lindsay, managing director of custody, takes a
similar view. 'These developments will help to automate the process and
eventually allow us to reduce staff levels slightly,' he says.
As for Swift, meanwhile, the bankers in their club may be able to relax in
the knowledge that many of the fund managers will not be filling in their
membership forms after all.
THE complex flow of information that has to take place before a securities
trade can be completed is becoming increasingly automated. Many of the
messages, such as those to local custodians or to representatives in local
markets, are carried on Swift, the interbank messaging system.
However, telex and fax machines continue to play a part in communications
between investors on the one hand and their brokers and custodians on the
other - though messages between investors and custodians are sometimes
carried on the custodians' own proprietary systems.
ETC (Electronic Trade Confirmation) and ISITC (Industry Standardisation for
Institutional Communications) are intended to fill these gaps. ETC will
automate trade confirmation between investors and their brokers. ISITC will
perform the same function between investors and custodians. Once completed,
the process will be handled electronically.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (9): Eyes on foreign customers -
Swiss banks believe the industry is over-competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS bankers have still not quite got over the audacity of the big US banks
in making a business out of the provision of custodian services.
From the Swiss point of view, custodian service has always been one of many
functions carried out by bankers in looking after their customers'
portfolios.
And they, as bankers to the world's rich, had been doing it for decades
before the Americans put a name on it and in the 1970s turned it into a
profit centre.
In fact, Swiss bankers acknowledge US banks were also responding to a new
trend in investment - the desire of large investment institutions to hedge
their risks by investing a portion of their assets in foreign securities.
Perhaps their pique is related to the fact that they did not see the
opportunity first. 'We were awakened only after the US banks did it,' Mr
Ernst Balsiger, executive vice-president of Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC),
admits.
Now their view is that the business, which for a while was highly profitable
for a few banks, has become over-competitive. 'It is simply ridiculous,'
says Mr Burkhard Gutzeit, head of securities operations and global custody
at Credit Suisse in Zurich. 'This business is not profitable unless you are
dealing in the billions of dollars, and the institutions are pressuring us
to cut prices further.'
The Swiss say that margins are becoming too thin to justify the investment
required in the necessary electronic control and information systems. 'You
have to invest Dollars 100m plus if you start from scratch,' Mr Gutzeit
says. 'Then you can enhance the system up to a point, but it is like with
cars, there comes a point when you have to buy a new one.'
He and other Swiss bankers predict that these pressures will lead to the big
European clearing organisations, Euroclear and Cedel, gradually taking over
the global custody business from individual banks, as only these
organisations will have the volume needed to support the immense cost of
electronic system development.
Moreover, he predicts, the European banking community will lose its legal
struggle to prevent the big investing institutions from having direct access
to the clearing organisations. That means many institutions will gradually
abandon their banker custodians and deal directly with the clearing
organisations for settlement and custody services.
The response of the Swiss banks to this outlook has been typically thorough
and cautious, with a view to providing service where it makes sense to do so
and keeping all options open. Fortunately for them, they all have very large
private banking businesses in which custody services remain part of the
total package of fund management offered to high net worth individuals.
Thus, they have to build up their custody capability anyway, and this
capability can then be turned into a commercial product offered to
institutions and to foreign custodians seeking sub-custodians in
Switzerland.
All the big three banks say they are committed to the local institutional
market, and, to differing degrees, are going after institutions in other
countries as well.
In part, their interest in seeking foreign customers appears to be a
response to the competitive threat from the big US custody specialists in
the Swiss market. By all accounts, these incursions are modest so far, and
the Swiss are confident that they can hold their own.
But UBS, among others, wants to retaliate. 'US custodians are actively
penetrating the Swiss market, so we have to use the same weapons. Our
marketing plan is to penetrate interesting markets in the US. Their pension
funds are investing more and more overseas,' says Mr Josef Landolt, senior
vice-president for securities administration.
But with the exception of SBC's large operation in London, the big three
have tended to scale down their custodial operations outside Switzerland in
recent years, preferring to contract out to sub-custodians and clearing
houses in important foreign dealing centres.
Mr Landolt makes clear that UBS's priority is to serve domestic
institutions, including smaller banks.
The big three are also members of the European clearing systems, Credit
Suisse and SBC in Euroclear and UBS in Cedel. They are also the dominant
shareholders in Intersettle, a system intended to serve all Swiss banks,
taking over the settlement of their international securities transactions.
The Intersettle system, developed at a cost of more than SFr60m, is now
being tested, and is due to go into full operation in the first quarter of
1994.
Mr Gutzeit believes Intersettle will gradually take away much of the banks'
Swiss-based global custodial business, but, since it is at least owned by
the Swiss banks, that is better than losing custom to the European clearing
systems, in his view.
Mr Landolt agrees that Intersettle could take away custody business, not
only from banks, but also from Euroclear and Cedel, provided it offers a
competitive service. 'Personally, I feel we will not channel our total
business through Intersettle. I have the strong feeling that we can continue
to attract business from the institutions.'
Mr Gutzeit agrees. 'It is difficult to draw the line between institutions
that need back office support and those that do not. We are strategically
well placed because private clients demand a system that is close to what
small institutions want.'
Mr Landolt suspects that the trend among large investment institutions to
split their asset management related contracts among many banks may soon
fade. 'We think costs are higher if these services are unbundled,' he says.
For example, if one bank is only a fund manager and another handles
settlement and custody, both have to keep accounts and the fund manager has
to check that the custodian has done what he was told to do.
Mr Landolt accepts, however, that institutional customers will continue to
demand to know the cost of each element of the service they are buying.
However the business evolves, the Swiss are expecting it to be difficult for
the next few years.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (10): Stronger commitment - Profile
of Swiss Bank Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO years ago, the FT published a debate between two senior executives of
Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) on whether the bank was wise to continue to
develop its global custody business.
Today, the argument rages on, both within SBC and throughout the banking
community, but SBC's commitment to global custody seems, if anything,
stronger than it was two years ago.
'We are fully committed,' says Mr Ernst Balsiger, executive vice-president
of SBC in Zurich, but he also predicts a big shake-out in the sector in the
next few years as excessive competition leads to a margin squeeze.
SBC's involvement in global custody is interesting in at least two respects.
In the first place, the bank is still trying to carve out a strong
independent role for itself in this increasingly competitive business, while
the two other big Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse,
appear to be more cautious. Second, it is running the business in London,
not in Switzerland.
But, first, some qualifications and clarifications. All the Swiss banks have
been carrying out global custody, in the strict sense of the term, for
decades. Indeed, it would probably be fair to say they were pioneers in
global custody, for it was their wealthy private clients from around the
world who were among the first to accept the idea of a mix of securities
from various countries in their portfolios.
Similarly, the big Swiss banks all carry out global custody for their Swiss
and, to varying degrees, foreign institutional customers in Switzerland, and
they act as sub-custodians in Switzerland for global custodians based in
other countries.
Where SBC differs is in aggressively marketing a global custody service
based in London to investment institutions and banks around the world. 'All
our institutional clients, even Swiss ones, are directed there,' Mr Balsiger
says.
The strategic decision to proceed this way was taken three years ago, with
the idea being to build on the unusually strong sub-custodian business SBC
had built in London over several years. According to Mr Alan Taylor,
director of global custody in London, the bank provides this service for
nearly 150 non-British banks.
The bank is typically discreet about the size of its London business - 'not
quite as substantial as that of the UK clearing banks,' says Mr Taylor. 'We
rank as one of the best, but it is not our goal to be the biggest,' adds Mr
Balsiger. And the business has 'broken even', he adds.
The group has developed an electronic system to support its custody
operation so that clients can request information at SBC offices throughout
the world.
Mr Taylor dismisses the widespread view that global custody will become a
commodity business, thus squeezing out all but the largest players. 'When we
are asked to compete for an account these days, we often get a 20-page
questionnaire to fill out. That is not a characteristic of commodity
businesses.'
He says there remain many differences in the service features provided by
global custodians. SBC, with a staff of 50 in its London operation,
emphasises staff training so that client requests can be dealt with
intelligently.
The bank assigns a single officer to each client, who visits the client
regularly, talks his language and tries to respond to his needs.
Meanwhile, in Switzerland, SBC is pursuing a dual strategy on custodial
services. It is a member of Intersettle, the organisation being set up by
many Swiss banks to provide settlement and custody services on foreign
transactions. Intersettle is expected to take over much, if not all, of
their Swiss-based global custody business for institutions.
But it is also maintaining a strong custodial capability as part of its
total service package for private clients. 'There we have an advantage
because our private clients will never try to become members of
international clearing organisations,' says Mr Balsiger.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (8): National powerhouse - Profile
of State Street Boston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 200-year-old State Street Boston, has undergone one of the biggest
changes since the 1980s, with a new chief executive, Marshall Carter,
replacing William Edgerly, State Street's long-standing leader.
Mr Edgerly is credited with transforming the institution from a struggling
New England bank into a national powerhouse. Mr Edgerly was quick to realise
the importance of new technology to State Street's future growth. Shortly
after he took over in 1975, he implemented a programme to modernise State
Street's data services and turned the bank's focus towards global custody
and securitisation, through mutual funds and money market funds.
Today, it is something of a misnomer to call State Street a bank. Strictly
speaking, State Street is a bank holding company and does handle some
lending and a small number of traditional bank accounts, but the bulk of its
business comes from servicing financial assets. State Street now has Dollars
1,247bn in assets under custody, with cross-border assets under custody
standing at around Dollars 123bn, up 25 per cent from a year ago.
Mr Carter's appointment came as a surprise and followed the unexpected
resignation of Mr Edgerly's heir apparent, Mr Peter Madden, last year.
Although most observers had expected Mr Edgerly to choose another successor
from within the ranks of State Street, the choice of Mr Carter met with
widespread approval. Mr Carter, who was at Chase Manhattan for 15 years
before joining State Street, is credited with building Chase into one of the
biggest global custody businesses in the US.
Investors in State Street Boston have little to complain about. Net income
for the third quarter has risen more than 50 per cent to Dollars 41.9m, and
the institution's stock is trading at the top of its 52-week range. Most
analysts expect State Street to continue to generate significant new account
volume. Earlier this year it won the important Dollars 65bn California
Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) account.
It won the Calpers business by offering to charge about half as much as its
closest competitor in fees. The sharp undercutting has led to accusations
that State Street bought the business to get market share, and some critics
charge that State Street has started a price war which will hurt the bank as
well as its competitors.
State Street maintains that it attracts its big customers because of its
state-of-the-art technology and its full service capabilities, while its
economies of scale allow it to offer reduced fees in a maturing market and
still make a profit.
While some see the aggressive bid for Calpers as a sign of a change in the
industry, others see the hand of Mr Carter at work, and suggest it as an
indication that State Street will become even tougher.
The global custody industry is becoming fiercely competitive after a decade
of extremely rapid growth.
The industry's staggering growth in the 1980s was fuelled by public and
corporate pension funds moving into foreign investments. But as the industry
has matured, the pace of growth has started to slow. In addition, several
newcomers have entered the arena, including Morgan Stanley, while the merger
of Chemical Bank with Manufacturer's Hanover will create competitive global
custody operations.
One way that State Street is responding to the heightened competition is by
turning its attention to emerging markets. 'Emerging markets have always
been part of our global custody business,' says Mr Gundy, 'but the range and
pace has grown dramatically. We now have a presence in about 46 countries,
compared with about 34 countries a few years ago.'
Although the rate of growth in emerging markets will probably slow in coming
years, Mr Gundy expects absolute growth to continue. 'Institutional
investors are looking for exciting opportunities for getting into markets at
the earliest possible points so they have a shot at the biggest possible
gains.'
Mr Gundy believes State Street will also benefit from the Robert Maxwell
affair, which has led to a heightened sensitivity to the issue of separating
fiduciary responsibility from money management. 'It has changed the
inclination of institutional investors, who now want a clear definition of
responsibility, separating holding assets from managing assets. I think this
will translate into more business for us.'
Investing in new technology remains imperative in the global custody
industry. In 1991, State Street installed an accounting system to track
global securities portfolios in multiple currencies.
But State Street's rivals are also spending heavily on new hardware and
software. Citicorp, for example, is pumping Dollars 80m into its securities
processing systems for a complete overhaul by 1994.
Mr Gundy expects to see further fine-tuning of State Street's systems to
present more information more clearly and more quickly.
So far, the changes within State Street since Mr Carter took charge have
been subtle, according to Mr Gundy. 'There has been a re-affirmation of our
strategy and an increased focus on the business of servicing financial
assets. One piece of tangible evidence is the addition of an executive
vice-president responsible for all securities operations. That position
didn't exist before Mr Carter came.'

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (6): Foreign opportunities beckon -
Emerging markets are attracting more attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS said that in Turkey, the secondary market for stocks and shares
consists of men outside the exchange building selling suitcases full of
certificates for cash.
While that may be an exaggeration for Turkey - or indeed for many of what
are now known as emerging markets - it offers a glimpse into one of the most
problematical, but potentially most interesting and lucrative, aspects of
the global custody business.
Deciding on exactly which markets are still emerging is a subject of some
debate, but broadly speaking, most Latin American markets, many Pacific
Basin markets and almost anything in Africa, eastern Europe or the Middle
East fall into that category. And, because of the handsome returns investors
have earned from those markets, global custodians have been forced to sit up
and take notice.
Dr Mark Mobius, chief investment director at Templeton Emerging Markets, one
of the world's largest investors in that sector, has long complained that
the reluctance of custodians to service these markets has been the greatest
barrier to investment. 'If we have to wait around for the banks to be more
aggressive, it's a great disadvantage,' he said. 'But custodians are
changing their attitudes.'
Over the past year or so, he said, custodians have been more willing to
invest capital in nascent markets from Pakistan to the Philippines, although
not nearly enough to suit the needs of professional investors. In part, this
willingness to take on greater risk has been prompted by the intense
competition for new business.
'One area which has caused fund managers a great deal of difficulty was the
reluctance of custodian banks to offer their services until long after the
market was open to foreign investors,' said Mr Jeremy Paulson-Ellis,
chairman of Genesis Investment Management, a company which invests
exclusively in emerging markets. 'With banks losing large amounts of money
elsewhere, the custodians are not willing to put in the necessary
development capital to emerging markets,' he said.
Entry to an emerging market requires not only investment in technology, but
also expert knowledge of securities and banking regulation, market practice
and tax law.
Mr Ranjit Chatterji, head of Latin American securities at Citibank's global
custody operations, said that part of the complaints from fund managers
stems from the inability of banks to overcome the very real operational
difficulties of trading in these markets. Deregulation in emerging markets
has raised investors' expectations beyond the capacity of markets to receive
their cash.
'Regulation isn't always well designed in attracting investment flows
because there is too little investment in settlement and post-settlement
systems,' he said. 'This leads to a mismatch between investors' expectations
and what can be done.' Also, many of the countries deregulating their
securities markets have also been simultaneously deregulating their foreign
exchange markets, although not necessarily in tandem. The inability to
obtain local currency for investment or to earn a return on it while it lies
idle, has frustrated institutional investors.
Emerging markets fund managers note that just as the quality of service from
custodians varies, so, too, there is a wide range of fees. In a recent
analysis of fees, one fund manager said he found a 42 per cent variation
between the highest and lowest fees charged by any of his custodians on an
average Dollars 100m portfolio and a 26 per cent variation in fees on a
Dollars 50m portfolio. 'There was no correlation between fees and service,'
the fund manager said.
It is not that fund managers do not appreciate the risks of being a
custodian in some of these global markets. 'There are markets where you
shouldn't invest at all,' said Mr Richard Watts, head of Latin American
investments at Gartmore Fund Management. 'The custodial operations are poor,
the stock market practices are poor, the market isn't transparent and the
locals don't play by the rules.'
Mr Watts said that in Venezuela, for instance, where settlement is
officially three to five days after trade date, he has found settlement may
not actually take place for 125 days after trade date.
Citicorp has found that while failed trades occur in roughly 10 per cent of
all bargains in Latin America as a whole, in Venezuela the figure for failed
trades is 70 to 80 per cent of all bargains.
In India, there are 19 separate exchanges, the largest of which is in
Bombay. In Indian market practice, there is no delivery against payment.
Also, due to settlement delays brokers can find themselves holding cash and
securities for considerable periods. Buyers and sellers are exposed to the
broker for the entire settlement period. Such inefficiencies leave
custodians open to risks which they are unwilling or unable to accept.
Also, the information base on which custodians must act is poor in many
emerging markets. For instance, in some countries, there is no up-to-date
central register of stock ownership. As a result, clients may be unaware of
corporate actions such as stock splits or dividend increases.
Local regulations also hamper development of efficient custodial systems.
For instance, in Pakistan a rule requiring foreign investors to re-register
every time stock changes hands means a foreigner buying a share is
effectively forced to hold it for up to 75 days until registration is
completed.
Institutional investors say the best custodians are those who learn the nuts
and bolts of markets and work with local authorities without considering the
operational difficulties.
Meanwhile, Templeton's Dr Mobius said one means of dealing with troublesome
local markets may be Citicorp's idea of designating a single local
sub-custodian in each market. The single sub-custodian might then be
encouraged to make a substantial capital investment in improving the service
it offers in that market because it would have a captive clientele. Citicorp
says that in markets where it is a sub-custodian, it would designate itself.
But other fund managers are sceptical. 'I would never leave myself in a
monopoly supplier situation,' said Mr Paulson-Ellis.
Placing too great a reliance on a single sub-custodian, could hinder the
ability to negotiate the best price for the service or to select a
competitor if the service deteriorates.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (7): New challenge looms - Tracy
Corrigan discusses derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE increasing use of derivative products by investment managers has created
new competitive challenges for global custodians. The complexity of the
instruments involved, and their relationship with the rest of an investment
portfolio, requires more sophisticated reporting than straightforward equity
or bond trades, as well as strong operational support.
Although futures markets have existed for several decades, it is only
recently that derivatives have started to be viewed as investment as well as
trading instruments.
But, while the development of structuring and trading of derivatives has
been at the top of banks' agendas for a couple of years, banks have been
slower to react by gearing up their global custody business to meet these
new demands.
'Typically , old custodial systems were designed to track the positions of
physical securities,' said Mr Aidan Dennis, product development manager,
global securities services, at Chase Manhattan. 'Now we're heading into a
paperless environment and there are new techniques such as short-selling.
Derivatives are just one part of an enhanced investment strategy.'
Systems now have to be able to perform an increasingly wide range of
functions. Fund managers require a system which can record any open
positions, consolidate positions across accounts, value positions, calculate
full economic exposure, measure performance and track collateral.
With constraints on capital, some banks have been slow to make the necessary
investments in terms of systems and personnel needed to offer a full service
for derivatives.
'I think one-stop shopping for derivatives will happen, but it requires
substantial investment in much more dynamic systems,' said one custody
specialist at a large bank. 'It will take a few years before it is widely
available.'
The reporting of positions forms a crucial part of the global custodian's
function in the area of potentially risky derivatives. For institutions to
gain the maximum benefit from reporting, it is not enough for custodians to
detail every individual position. For example, if an investor has a long
position in Company A equity warrants, and is short Company A shares, the
overall neutral position should be shown, rather than two separate
positions. 'There is a need to account for the use of derivatives in a
manner which most accurately reflects the investors' use of strategy,' said
Mr Alex Ehrlich, executive director at Goldman Sachs.
Investors who have studied the issue agree. '(The reporting of derivatives)
will have to become part of the standard service,' said Mr Glyn Peat of
Lazard Investors, who chaired the Pensions Research Accountants Group's
futures and options working party.
Different types of derivative products demand different approaches. For
example, for institutions which are active in exchange-traded futures, one
function of the global custodian is to handle the payment of margin
requirements. Because of their size, custodians can take advantage of
economies of scale, as well as swapping an investor's assets for comparable
assets which can be used as collateral for margin calls.
However, they are effectively competing against brokers, who perform
functions such as margining and exposure management. To win business away,
they will have to offer a more comprehensive service, which many custodians
have not yet developed.
The issues surrounding over-the-counter options are more complex. First,
valuation of such options is difficult, since there may be no active market
and options values shift constantly. Further, price movements are not in
proportion to cash market movements.
The issue of reporting and performance measurement has come under focus this
year, as more fund managers start using derivatives, and trustees struggle
to get to grips with the concepts involved. Early this year, the London
International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) and Mercer Fraser published
recommendations for the reporting of financial futures and options in
investment portfolios, designed to provide UK pension fund managers with
professionally-agreed standards of performance measurement of derivatives
for the first time.
The new guidelines allow trustees to assess more easily whether fund
managers are using futures and options for investment or hedging purposes,
or whether they are taking more speculative positions.
Building on the Liffe recommendations, the Pensions Research Accountants
Group (Prag), an association of 200 UK pension fund practitioners, last
month published a document on the use of futures and options by pension
funds which provides broader guidance for trustees, investment and pension
fund managers on how best to meet reporting, control and performance
measurement demands.
The report focuses on strategies and risks to be considered by trustees and
ways of constraining investment managers. Prag supports Liffe's view on
reporting futures on an 'associated economic exposure' basis - looking at
the total exposure of a particular position, rather than just taking account
of the initial margin payment. In the more complex area of options, the
compromise solution is to account for premiums paid and received, and mark
option prices to market. In fact, this does not fully reflect exposure,
since accurate reporting requires technical calculations of the relationship
between cash prices and option prices.
As the participation of investment managers in derivatives business grows,
the attention given to back-office problems will also be encouraged. At
present, unfamiliarity with the complex products involved has made
derivatives something of a bugbear with the back-office staff.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (4): Code of practice demanded -
Andrew Jack focuses on the practice of stock lending in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK LENDING has risen from the depths of obscurity to new heights of
public awareness in the past few months - but for all the wrong reasons.
The legacy of the late Mr Robert Maxwell has done more to publicise and in
some ways more to damage the reputation of the activity than millions spent
on advertising could ever have achieved.
Poor controls on stock lending at Bishopsgate Investment Management, the
trustee and manager of Maxwell pension funds, with widely-known
consequences, have helped further stoke existing fears from lenders that
stock lending is a high-risk business.
Yet Mr Simon Thomas of Davis International Banking Consultants believes the
practice has suffered unfairly as a result. 'Maxwell has dented people's
confidence,' he says. 'But it has been totally misunderstood by
commentators. The market has been rather weak at defending itself.'
He argues that the episode highlights the lack of supervisory control over
pension fund management, and the value of dealing with well-regulated
counter-parties. 'What is quite clear is that there are no standard legal
agreements for stock lending,' he adds. 'It has to be improved.'
Nevertheless, the role and growth of international stock lending is widely
endorsed by market professionals. As Mr Ian Plenderleith, an associate
director of the Bank of England and chairman of its stock borrowing and
lending committee, said at a conference this summer, it has helped provide
both timely settlement and liquidity.
Timely settlement, he said, resulted in improved market safety, cost savings
and ultimately enhanced investor protection. Liquidity could only be assured
in bear markets if securities could be borrowed.
Stock lending also helped channel savings into investment, he added, by
bringing together lenders with borrowers where they can raise funds on finer
terms.
He called on the industry to boost its public information efforts and to
develop a code of good practice to help counter what he called public
'misunderstanding'.
In spite of the reservations expressed in some quarters, there has certainly
been a significant growth in demand for international stock lending over the
past few years, driven directly by the expansion of cross-border investment
and international securities trading.
There have been considerable technological advances, product innovation, and
progress towards more efficient clearing and settlement on most of the
world's stock exchanges, driven by the pressure since 1989 from the G30, the
Group of 30 financial and economic experts.
There has also been a growth in competition, with an expansion in the range
of lenders such as UK unit trusts, and of specialist intermediaries.
Future growth, according to Mr Plenderleith, will in part be constrained by
tax reform. He highlights the achievement early last year for UK lenders of
new accounting arrangements for pools of participants with the Inland
Revenue.
Now efforts are being directed towards overseas lenders. He says that
agreement on a relaxation of restrictions on the range of international
securities borrowers and on the number of parties involved in lending
transactions depends on arrangements on the tax treatment of manufactured
dividends.
In many other countries, stock lending has been hindered by demanding tax
requirements. For instance, the practice only began to develop in France in
1987, and in Switzerland in 1990 with the introduction of a more favourable
regime.
Mr Thomas questions how far lending will continue to grow in the UK. 'There
is so much resistance,' he says. 'People have been nervous about stock
lending. There are stories of it taking 20 years for a mandate to be
signed.' He argues that while UK major funds are over-funded and their
performance is so good, companies do not see the need. 'The pressure just
hasn't been there.'
Elsewhere, he points to developments in Italy and Germany. Now attention is
beginning to focus on Spain. Growing competition puts pressure on margins,
which he says can be 100-250 basis points for some international lending
arrangements, compared with 30-50 points in the UK.
He sees substantial changes taking place in the future, fuelled in part by
Taurus, the Stock Exchange's electronic settlement system, the relaxation of
restrictions on international lending, and changing market structures.
In the US, Ms Cindy Gall of Citibank points to the growing role of
international stock lending, particularly with European markets such as the
UK and Germany. 'With a 24-hour book, European centres are becoming very
important,' she says.
Mr Thomas says it is both a good time and a bad time to review developments
in the sector. A series of regulatory changes are underway, many of which
still wait to come to fruition.
Mr Plenderleith highlighted three types of safeguards which he said ensured
that the inherent risks of stock lending were 'identified, controlled and
covered':
Bilateral legal agreements signed by the counterparties to ensure adequate
collateral, proper authorisation by agents and clear understanding
responsibilities.
Industry-wide rules, agreed practices and tax regulations which govern
activity, conduct and appropriate treatment.
Supervision from different national regulatory authorities to maintain
standards and require adequate capital to cover the risks undertaken.
Maxwell has had some positive effects. It is widely credited with pushing
forward legislative change, moving the UK more towards the degree of
regulation found in the US. Mr Thomas says it is increasingly focusing on
the need for separate professional trustees, and the separation of asset
management from custody.
At the moment, he says there is already considerable discretionary power in
the UK, but it is not exercised. But he adds: 'Some people say it may need
another Maxwell scandal to force the whole thing through.'

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (5): How to set about choosing the
right partner - Andrew Jack finds out what fund managers look for in
custodians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARKUS RUETIMANN does not suffer sloppy work gladly. Last year he
dismissed two of his firm's 25 local custodians after reservations over the
quality of the work they provided.
Mr Ruetimann is director of client and market services at UBS Asset
Management in London, and a strong defender of the importance of a series of
local or regional custodians rather than a single global agent.
The firm uses its own nominees for UK equities, with agents in the UK for
gilts and commercial paper. Overseas custody is delegated to some 25 active
custodians and 29 inactive custodians.
'We are quite happy to pay a little more to be close to the right partner,'
he says. 'But if the price or service ratio rises, they have to go.'
His attitude appears to reflect part of a wider trend shared by other fund
managers moving away from global custodians to a more localised and flexible
network of regional and local providers.
Yet it stands in stark contrast to much of the perceived market movements in
the past few months, substantially as the result of what the industry widely
calls 'the Max factor'.
Global custodians are hard-selling their services partly linked to the fears
arising from the stock lending abuses associated with the pension funds in
the business empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
That has stoked considerable interest, while boosting the role of
value-added services and a shift away from price towards security.
A survey by Phillips and Drew Fund Management of 800 of the largest UK
pension funds earlier this year showed a sharp increase in the proportion
using or considering using a global custodian.
Its survey one year ago showed that 15.4 per cent were using a global
custodian, and 4.6 per cent were actively considering their use. This year,
16.1 per cent said they used a global custodian, and 10.6 per cent were
considering employing a global custodian.
But Mr Ruetimann says that few are ultimately persuaded by the arguments.
'The firm has not lost a single client.' He considers Maxwell to be a red
herring for clients. 'If there is anything positive about the Maxwell
affair, it was to increase the understanding of pension fund management,' he
says.
It has also had the unintended consequence of vastly increasing the number
of meetings with company executives, auditors and others to discuss the
issues. 'Clients do understand the issues much more than before,' he says.
'Maxwell had nothing to do with fund management. It was a question of
management control procedures.'
What he does stress is the importance of using the same system for
reconciliation, even though his firm has different managements for
investment and asset administration. 'The more people involved in
reconciliation, the more possibility of fraud and mistakes,' he says.
Mr Ruetimann says the benefits of using regional custodians include
flexibility, less dependency and greater cost-effectiveness. It allows local
negotiations in line with local practice over fees, rather than negotiating
a single fee for all markets with a single global custodian.
The result, he believes, with increased competition and reducing margins,
will be a reduction in the number of global custodians over the next decade.
He argues that the true liabilities are not always put on their balance
sheets, so their position may be weaker than it appears.
There have also been considerable other changes affecting the relationship
between fund managers and custodians in the last few months, which have made
the services more commoditised.
Since June this year, fund managers have gained access to Swift, the
electronic funds settlement system, which allows them to use the
standardised messages facility. Electronic trade confirmation has also been
introduced.
Phillips and Drew prefers to use banks rather than brokers as custodians
overseas, because Mr Ruetimann says their creditworthiness tends to be
greater, they have more capital, the technology is better and they are much
more accommodating at accepting liability.
More generally, he cites 'the 7 Cs' of how the firm chooses the right
partner:
Cash management: with stocks invested in interest-bearing accounts with the
interest passed on to the client.
Curtailment of risks: ensuring that potential custodians have appropriate
systems, controls and insurance.
Competitiveness of fees: to be offset against quality of service provide.
Credit-rating: examining the net assets and ensuring the balance sheet of
the agent is healthy.
Communication and technology: how easy it is to communicate with agents and
maintain links with them.
Customisation capabilities: now that custody is becoming more commoditised.
Commitment and comfort: with regular checking of compliance backed up by
personal visits.
The jury may still be out on the future balance between global and regional
custodians, but the next few years will certainly see plenty of dynamism
from more aggressive fund managers to respond to changing demands.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (3): Timetable proved too tight -
The G30 settlement targets were unrealistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE years ago the Group of 30, a Washington-based think tank, laid down a
blueprint for national settlement systems in securities markets around the
world. Its nine proposals were intended to galvanise thinking in financial
centres across the globe, providing an international standard, and a
timetable, against which local developments could be measured. And most of
it had to be completed by the end of 1992.
Three years on, the G30's targets look to have been hopelessly unrealistic.
'It was always too optimistic,' says Mr Dick Feehan, senior vice-president
in London of Bankers Trust, one of the biggest global custodians. 'They
expected things to happen too fast. I just think it's lost momentum.'
The G30 is due in the coming weeks to produce its latest review of how far
settlement arrangements in the main financial centres have come to meeting
its targets. It is expected to show further significant advances from last
year. However, as Mr Feehan suggests, there is still a long way to go.
One of the biggest hurdles to be overcome is the move to settlement within
three days of a trade taking place. In the US, there are profound doubts in
many quarters about such a short settlement cycle, which is suited more to
institutional than retail investors. And the UK does not even have a system
of rolling settlement, let alone one that works on a three-day cycle.
Despite the amount of work that still needs to be done, the G30 has few
doubts that it was right to set the tight timetable it did. 'We recognised
that the targets were ambitious,' says Mr Julian Gibbs of Barclays, a member
of the working party that drew up the recommendations. 'But we realised that
if we didn't put tight deadlines into our report, people would just delay
their decision-making.'
The soundness of the G30's proposals has not been dented by the fact its
timetable has proved too ambitious, he adds. A recent endorsement by Iosco
(the International Organisation of Securities Commissions) suggests the G30
was working along the right lines. Earlier this autumn, an Iosco report on
settlement arrangements in emerging markets endorsed the G30
recommendations.
Good intentions do not necessarily mean the ideas will ever see the light of
day, of course. The appalling state of settlement arrangements in some
developing markets has been exemplified this year by the securities scandal
that has shaken India: ancient and decrepit settlement arrangements provided
the opportunity for abuse when soaring activity in financial markets
outstripped the capacity of the systems to cope with it.
Scandals like that in India, and the need for emerging markets to compete
for investment funds, are likely to prompt modernisation. But as
international fund managers are only too well aware, good settlement is
usually an afterthought in the opening up of domestic stockmarkets to
international capital.
The UK, meanwhile, remains one of the developed countries which is most
behind in meeting the G30 recommendations. Clearing and settlement remains
largely a manual process, making it prone to errors, and settlement still
only takes place up to four weeks after a trade has happened.
Despite this, there is a strong belief throughout the securities industry
that London's settlement problems are about to be laid to rest. The Taurus
project, which will see settlement first of all automated and then put on to
a rolling basis, has entered its testing stages this autumn. A nagging fear
that the whole project would eventually be shelved, after more than a decade
of debate and planning, seems largely to have been laid to rest in recent
weeks.
For Mr John Watson, the project manager who has led the London Stock
Exchange's Taurus development, it is a vindication of several years of
effort. He denies that the project is running years late and over budget.
'We're now very much at the stage where I said we would be,' he says. And he
adds that it took four years and around Pounds 80m to build Relit, the
French system - roughly the same time and budget that Taurus's construction
will have taken, if it is completed next autumn.
Whether the UK is then ready to move quickly to three-day rolling settlement
will depend on what happens in the next few months. Few big UK companies
have yet asked their shareholders' permission to amend their articles of
association, something that is necessary before they can move to a paperless
system for recognising and transferring the ownership of shares. Most are
due to hold their annual general meetings in the first part of next year,
giving them the chance to make the switch. But if too few make the
transition, it will be impossible for the Stock Exchange to move quickly to
a shorter settlement period.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (2): Call for stricter rules -
After Maxwell, UK controls are under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CUSTODY business is the one area of the financial services industry that
is still unregulated. However, it is not likely to remain so.
The death at sea on November 5, 1991, of Robert Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell
Communications Corporation, sparked an investigation which revealed more
than Pounds 400m was missing from pension schemes he controlled. The way in
which assets disappeared has called into question the role of custodians and
the rules under which they operate.
Using a series of transactions nominally labelled stock lending - although,
in fact, it bore little resemblance to such practice - ownership of shares
passed from the pension fund managers and custodians to other Maxwell-owned
companies. The ease with which this was achieved has dismayed MPs, who are
demanding new rules to regulate pension schemes, fund managers and
custodians.
The government has appointed an independent committee, headed by Professor
Roy Goode, to study pensions law, especially as it applies to custodians,
and to make recommendations. And in March, the cross-party Parliamentary
select committee on social security, which has held extensive hearings into
the Maxwell affair, also suggested fund managers be required to use a
separate custodian for assets under their control.
The idea has alarmed the UK's largest fund managers, almost all of whom
operate custodial companies and derive significant fees from them. The
National Association of Pension Funds, which has also called for the
regulation of custodians, has suggested a more modest measure. It believes
that custodians should only be separate from the fund manager for those
pension funds which are managed in-house. That suggestion, however, has
upset the UK's largest banks which are both fund manager and custodian for
their own pension schemes.
The sums are not inconsiderable. More than two-thirds of the assets of
Lloyds Asset Management belong to its own pension scheme and Barclays de
Zoete Wedd manages more than Pounds 6bn of Barclays Bank pension scheme
assets.
Perhaps the most contentious issue for custodians has been the suggestion
that securities be registered in designated names. Mr Robin Ellison, partner
at pensions solicitors Ellison Westhorp, says the idea is unsound. 'If you
put Pounds 5 in the bank one week and then go back the following week to
withdraw it, you simply ask for Pounds 5. You dont say 'I want my five
pounds'.'
Mr Michael Robarts of Fleming Investment Management, argues that designation
not only offers little protection to clients, but will also slow down the
settlement process, raising costs for everyone and increasing risks. 'Chaos
will ensue,' he predicts.
Some firms, such as NM Rothschild and Mercury Asset Management, maintained
securities in the names of individual clients in the days before London's
Big Bang and the explosion in trading volume. However, this required
constant reconciliation of files, a cumbersome manual process that
frequently led to errors in valuing client accounts when securities were
filed incorrectly. When trading volumes rose sharply in 1987, the practice
was abandoned. A return to it, would create more problems than it would
solve.
In the aftermath of the Maxwell affair Mr John Quarrell, a partner at
solicitors Nabarro Nathanson and a leading pensions lawyer, advocated
requiring securities to be held in designated names, on the grounds that
such a move would have alerted securities firms to the true owners of shares
received as collateral for personal loans to Mr Maxwell. 'Since then, I've
moved my position. I've been persuaded by the well-run houses that it is the
auditing and the financial controls internally which matter most.'
The argument in favour of designation is best summed up, however, by one
example. Robson Rhodes, administrators to the Maxwell fund management
company Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), were able to recover Pounds
27m of shares in Teva Pharmaceutical, an Israeli company, from National
Westminster Bank because of designation. Although the shares were pledged as
collateral to Robert Maxwell's private interests, they were held in the name
of BIM, a firm whose sole purpose was to manage pension fund assets. Thus,
the liquidators were able to argue, NatWest should have been suspicious
about the ownership of securities it was accepting as collateral. Not only
were the shares returned but NatWest reimbursed the administrators Pounds
90,000 in costs.
But, says Mr Robarts, designation will do little to protect pension fund
assets because designation is under the control of the custodian. Had BIM
changed the designation to that of one of the Maxwell companies, the matter
could have been easily covered up.
The answer, he claims, is to improve financial controls on custodians. For
instance, audits of a fund manager do not include any review of the assets
under custody. His own company has, for the first time, asked its auditors
to include a statement about the custody business in the larger annual
report.
Also, there should be tighter controls on which pension fund trustees have
the authority to order custodians to move assets. While most custodians keep
sample signatures on file, they may not necessarily know the powers of
signatories.
Mr Robarts says custodians should be required to seek the permission of all
trustees of pension funds before an individual is given the authority to
move assets.
Meanwhile, some members of the pensions industry have suggested the UK
should adopt US-style Erisa legislation which requires custodians to refuse
to carry out orders which they believe or suspect to be improper. That view
has been discussed with the Securities and Investments Board, the City's
chief watchdog, which is said to favour it. But Mr Robarts argues unless the
largely clerical staff employed by custodians receive much better training,
the rule will offer little protection.
Moreover, the rule will allow the US banks, which already dominate the
global custody business, to claim a further edge on their UK competitors by
advertising to potential clients that they have long been following the
rule.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (1): Competition livens up - Once a

custody has become the focus of international rivalry. The effect has forced
banks to think of new products to lure clients
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A CROSS-BORDER securities settlement and administration product, global
custody has for years been little more than a back office operation, far
from the glamour of banking.
In recent years, however, the business, once a dreary backwater of telex
machines, clerks and computer tape, has been the beneficiary of large
amounts of capital investment, as new bank competitors have entered the
market.
The US-based commercial banks which have dominated this business are
increasingly being challenged by the rise of strong international
competitors, particularly in Japan and Continental Europe, and by investment
banks which have only recently fully understood how to capitalise on their
traditional role as master custodian for clients.
The effect has been a scaling-down of fees to levels previously undreamt of,
forcing banks to think of new products which will make their service stand
out from that of their competitors.
Earlier this year, the industry drew a collective gasp that State Street
Boston, one of the top 10 custodians, planned to charge the US's largest
institutional investor, the California Public Employees Retirement System,
less than one basis point for global custody services.
A typical portfolio for a global custody client might carry fees around six
basis points - down sharply from the 20 basis point fee which would have
prevailed just five years earlier, according to Mr Michael Borkan, head of
client relations at Bank of New York.
Fee pressures on European managers - who do not make custody charges public
 -are more modest than in the US, but custodians say that European clients
will seek lower fees eventually as well.
In addition, the admission of fund managers - the clients of global
custodians - to the international bank payments system known as Swift,
raises some ominous questions for the future of some custodians. Clients
will now be able to transmit instructions directly to, say, a sub-custodian
bank in Thailand, bypassing the global custodian entirely.
'Fund managers may well communicate directly with each other and with
subcustodians directly,' says Mr Robert Meyrick, head of Barclays Global
Securities Services. 'Fund managers may eventually grow out of their need
for global custodians,' he says. Only by providing services such as cash
management to an increasingly sophisticated clientele can custodians
continue to retain their customers.
There are two main reasons why banks are eager to be in a business where
fees are falling and competitors rising.
First, custodians have learned how to exploit certain ancillary aspects of
transactions banking so efficiently that only a relatively small proportion
of global custody revenues need come from client fees.
According to Mr Richard Foster, partner at the financial services practice
of management consultants, Booz Allen, a study of the business has shown
that no more than 50 to 60 per cent of custodians' revenues come from client
fees. An additional 20 to 30 per cent of revenues comes from the ability to
earn interest on clients' cash balances, and the rest from foreign exchange
transactions on behalf of customers.
Most clients are too sophisticated to allow their banker to exploit these
inefficiencies at their expense, but they can still be sold bolt-on services
such as cash management and foreign exchange dealing.
Moreover, with falling loan margins and rising write-offs from bad debts,
banks are anxious to seek out fee-based services which are more likely to
withstand the pressures of the present recession.
Ms Diane Glossman, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, notes in a recent
study of transactions banking in the US, that over the past decade,
non-interest income at large US banks rose to 40.6 per cent of total
revenues in 1991, from 26.0 per cent in 1981.
And while the largest portion of that has been from fees on client accounts,
for some banks transactions fees have been quite significant.
'Given that we expect loan demand to remain lacklustre in the face of an
unusually slow economic recovery in the US, we believe that banks will
continue to seek fee income as a replacement for volume,' Ms Glossman said.
Banks are willing to continue to invest large capital sums in their global
custody businesses, Ms Glossman notes, because large economies of scale are
available to the biggest participants, enabling them to charge competitive
fees to clients.
Indeed, Booz Allen estimates that the doubling of assets under a custodian's
control translates into a 35 per cent reduction in costs.
There appears also to be a return to more broadly-based banking
relationships as the largest companies reduce the number of banks with which
they conduct business. 'Clients and banks are looking for linkage between
products and relationship pricing,' Ms Glossman says. Thus banks with a wide
product range can capture clients more fully.
Some bankers acknowledge privately, too, that greater credit provision can
be extended to a custody client because the investment portfolio offers the
lender a greater comfort about liquidity and solvency.
Too many firms have, nevertheless, entered the global custody business, for
it to be profitable for all. 'We are looking for more consolidation,' said
Antonio Wever of Booz Allen. Already, Mellon Bank's recent acquisition of
blue-chip Boston Safe Company is regarded as a signpost to the future.
The successful businesses which remain will be those which have most closely
integrated global custody functions with other banking services. This means
not only the ability to integrate the traditional master custody business
with other services, such as cash or foreign exchange management, but also
to present information to clients in an integrated fashion. Bank of New
York, for instance, says it is developing a product which will allow clients
to see not only their securities positions on a daily basis but all the
supporting positions in derivatives or short sales elsewhere.
Such a product is of great interest to clients with investment portfolios
which commonly include all sorts of exchange traded and bespoke futures and
options, as well as complex hedging strategies.
Some of the US commercial banks who were the traditional industry leaders
might find themselves somewhat disadvantaged, Booz Allen has concluded,
because their global custody business was developed as a service distinct
from that of domestic custody. 'The merchant banks - such as Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley - may be the next industry leaders,' says Mr Foster.
Investment banks have been best able to exploit the opportunities for
international securities lending which are offered to global custodians.
This business alone can provide profits to justify entry to the business,
Booz Allen has concluded.
Furthermore, many of these traditional operators have been saddled with
enormous duplication of services within their business which drives costs up
considerably.
It will be the ability to slim services down and eliminate many of the
manual operations now required of custodians which will determine who will
be profitable and who will fall by the wayside.

FT  09 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Firm close after early loss reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUDDEN revival of confidence in the UK stock market yesterday afternoon
reversed early falls in share prices and put the market back on the bull
tack. A recovery in stock index futures provided the trigger for the upturn
in equities but sentiment was also encouraged by favourable reports from US
Purchasing Managers.
In early trading, a dull trend in the US dollar restrained the international
blue chips and the FT-SE Index sagged by 8.8 points. But trading volume was
very slow in the first couple of hours of the trading session.
The turn came when the December contract on the FT-SE Index found support
again and re-established a premium after the weakness of the past two
sessions. Share prices quickly moved higher, and trading volume increased as
ground was recaptured.
The market closed virtually at the day's best, with a gain of 15.3 taking
the FT-SE Index to 2,769.8. Seaq volume finally totalled 605m shares
compared with 426.7m on Monday when retail or customer business fell away to
only Pounds 879.6m; this retail figure represents a fall below the daily
averages of around Pounds 1bn recorded steadily since Britain quit the ERM
in mid-September.
Traders commented that the market's volatility reflected its underlying
confidence for the near term. While few strategists wanted to be drawn on
prospects for favourable news from this morning's meeting at the Bundesbank
 -news that a press conference has been arranged failed to stir excitement -
but there are still some hopes that domestic interest rates could be trimmed
by at least half a point before the end of the year.
The best news of the day came from across the Atlantic, when the US National
Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM), in its semi-annual economic
report, said that the outlook for US retail sales was the brightest for
three years. The past fortnight has seen the London market responding
readily to indications of economic improvement in the US.
By the close, the internationals were mostly firmer on the day, although,
with the Dow Average down 1.90 in London hours, support from New York was
very selective. One Far Eastern house active in London has urged clients to
'Buy the Footsie, sell the Dow', adding that the UK is a likely switch for
US equity investors now that the near term currency depreciation of the
dollar seems to be over. However. a poor exception among blue chips
yesterday was ICI, still out of favour with the UK investment community.
A sharp cut in UK petrol prices by BP caused some surprise but strategists
were unwilling to read too much into the move, in terms of benefit either
for the consumer or industry in general.
Retail and store issues, regarded as the sector likely to show the first
signs of benefit from economic recovery, continued to move ahead in modest
trading. Brewery stocks were in better form.
But the best gains came in sectors which are deemed to have suffered
over-severely as the stock market has slowed down over the past few
sessions. Water stocks came in for renewed buying.
A steadier trend in the Hong Kong market helped those UK stocks which have
been vulnerable to shocks from this direction.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in stock index futures moved sharply ahead in a volatile session
which saw increased rolling of positions forward into the March contract,
writes Joel Kibazo.
The December contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,764. However,
attempts by independent traders to send it higher proved fruitless and
December went into decline as some leading institutions turned sellers,
sending December to the day's low of 2,753 at around 11 pm. A sizeable share
of the selling was initiated by a desire to roll out of December and into
the March contract, which helped add to the day's overall volume.
Dealers said a reasonable amount of arbitrage was carried out at the lower
levels. The drying up of such activity, coupled with dealers covering short
positions, led to a turnaround in the fortunes of the December contract and
it advanced throughout the afternoon.
It finished at 2,775, up 18 on the previous session and around 3 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 4. Turnover reached
10,911 contracts.
In traded options, the FT-SE 100 option was again particularly busy
accounting for around half of the day's total volume of 24,209 contracts,
just ahead of Monday's figure.
HSBC was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 2,590 contracts.
Abbey National was next trading a total 737 contracts.

FT  09 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Legals helped by US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POSITIVE meeting on Monday evening between Legal &amp; General (Legals), the
insurance group, and Morgan Stanley, one of the most influential of the US
investment banks, was the trigger for an outstanding performance by L &amp; G
shares.
The shares ended a busy session 14 higher at 423p, a rise of 3.4 per cent
against a 0.6 per cent gain in the Footsie and a generally lack-lustre
showing by the rest of the insurance sectors.
Morgan Stanley's insurance specialist, Mr Youssef Ziai, said L &amp; G had
indicated that the domestic mortgage indemnity problems that have dogged L &amp;
G as well as other UK insurance groups had been addressed and that there was
now some light at the end of the tunnel.
Mr Ziai also said it was encouraging that L &amp; G's market share in life and
pensions had continued to pick up, rising from around 3 1/2 per cent in the
first quarter of the year to 3.9 per cent by the third quarter, with a
figure of 4.5 per cent now in prospect.
The US investment bank did not alter its profits expectations for L &amp; G but
emphasised the 12 per cent discount to net asset value and the possibility
that the group may nudge up the final dividend.
Forte doubts
Reversing its initially guarded support for Monday's disposal of Gardner
Merchant by Forte, the stock market began to show misgivings yesterday when
several brokers hinted that they were considering downgrading profit
forecasts in the hotel group. Criticisms expressed were that the deal could
ultimately prove dilutive and that Forte should have taken the extra cash
rather than retain a stake in the new venture.
With hotel trading expected to make only a slow recovery, earnings growth
may be restricted and some believe the hotel group's dividend to still be at
risk. The shares slipped a penny to 166 1/2 p. County NatWest was
recommending a switch out of Forte and into Ladbroke, the shares jumping 8
to 196p. UBS Phillips and Drew is also forecasting the stock to be one of
its 10 star performers in 1993.
TI hurt
Engineering company TI Group registered one of the largest falls in the
aerospace-related sector after the news that North West Airlines of the US
had cancelled orders for 74 aircraft manufactured by the European Airbus
consortium.
Analysts said the news would hit TI through its Dowty Group subsidiary,
which was acquired after a hostile bid earlier this year. It makes the
landing gear on the aircraft.
The shares responded by bucking the strong market trend and closed 7 lower
at 296p, after trade of 3.7m. Mr Chris Avery at Smith New Court said: 'This
further deterioration in Dowty's prospects will make it harder for TI to
avoid a material earnings dilution in 1993.'
Oil shares delivered another dismal showing, affected mostly by the decline
in the dollar against sterling. BP retreated 4 to 224p on turnover of 8.6m
with the market acutely disappointed by the outcome of BP's presentation to
UK and US oil specialists on Monday.
At the meeting Mr David Simon, BP's chief executive appeared to rule out an
increase in BP's dividend before 1985. 'The bulls are in disarray and the
bears in the ascendancy,' said one analyst. Some of the market's more
bullish analysts had expected a return to dividend growth by 1993/4 while
the bears had not expected such a move until 1994.
The US specialists, who have promoted much of the buying interest in BP
shares in recent months and increased US interest in the stock to around the
21 per cent level, were said to have been especially dismayed by the
dividend news.
Switching from BP to Shell saw the latter edge up 3 to 545p on 3m.
Enterprise retreated 9 to 447p and Lasmo 8 to 154p, the latter on heavy
turnover of 3.6m.
With the market beginning to adopt a more positive outlook for domestic
mortgage indemnity composites with big exposure in this area performed
relatively well. Sun Alliance, acknowledged as having the biggest indemnity
exposure, managed a minor improvement at 330p. Royal Insurance, however,
moved up strongly, boosted by the better outlook for DMI and the prospect
that the shares are one of the favourites for inclusion in the prestigious
Footsie-100 list when the FTSE steering committee meets today. At the close
Royal shares were 5 better at 265p with a hefty 6.4m traded. A block of 1.5m
Royals was easily absorbed the market early in the session
HSBC and Standard Chartered were outstanding performers in an otherwise
subdued banks area of the market with dealers taking the view that both
stocks had been oversold.
HSBC raced up 15 to 479p on good turnover of 8.8m shares, while Standard
Chartered, along with Royal Insurance, one of the front-runners for
inclusion in the Footsie-100, advanced 13 to 523p.
Abbey National slipped 4 to 354p after reports that Smith New Court had
reduced their profits estimates for the bank.
Results in line with expectations from Vaux were given the added boost of a
maintained dividend.
Investors were attracted by the fact that the stock goes ex on Monday.
Although the brewery and hotel group said trading conditions had been tough,
business had improved since the year end in September. Brokers downgraded by
around 5 per cent to a range Pounds 24-Pounds 28m.
Dividend attractions brought other investors into the drinks sector
yesterday. Bass, which also goes ex-dividend on Monday, gained 9 to 611p,
Greenalls 7 to 354p and Scottish and Newcastle 12 to 425p. Dollar earners
were also strong: Allied Lyons rose 4 to 643p and Grand Metropolitan 11 to
435p.
Vague hints that trading was under pressure at Burton were heard, with
suggestions from some corners that business at both Debenhams and Burtons
outlets was suffering. However, one leading analyst was largely dismissive
arguing that the recovery in the retail sector was still very patchy and
that any short-term downturn was not surprising. The shares slipped a
half-penny to 62 1/2 p. James Capel was said to have returned positive on
margins from a visit to Boots, the shares lifting 6 to 534p.
The food retail sector reached a 5-year high against the FT-All Share index,
although turnover was thin and analysts wary that it may have overrun.
Argyll and Sainsbury led the way, rising 6 to 405p and 5 to 542p
respectively. The volatile Kwik Save jumped 13 to 788p.
Rumours of further downgrades in ICI undermined the stock, although no firm
evidence was forthcoming. The company's joint broker, Hoare Govett, had
slashed its profits forecasts for 1993 and 1994 on Monday, blaming weak
trading conditions in October. The shares declined a further 9 yesterday to
1016p.
Tadpole Technology, the computer software group, followed up Monday's highly
successful market debut with another strong run, the shares surging a
further 28 to 113p; they were originally placed with investors at 65p a
share by Henry Cooke Lumsden, the stockbroker.
Shares in British Aerospace had a volatile session. They fell 7 to 134p,
early in the day on the cancellation by North West Airlines of its Airbus
aircraft order. BAe not only builds the wings on the aircraft but is also a
20 per cent partner in the Airbus consortium.
However the belief that the collapse of the European Fighter Aircraft
(EFA)project may be averted helped sentiment and the shares rallied to close
a penny lighter at 140p.
Shares in international conglomerate Lonrho continued to attract attention
and they closed a penny firmer at 74p, on vague talk in the market late in
the day, that chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland would soon announce the sale
of part of his holding in the company, a rights issue and a sizeable
disposal. Turnover which had languished for most of the day had jumped to
1.3m by the close.

FT  09 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Late buying takes prices to
new highs

Wall Street
After trading in a narrow range for most of the day, a burst of late buying
took US share prices to new highs yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.85 at 3,322.18,
having spent the best part of the day no more than a few points either side
of Monday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's rose 1.66 to
436.97, a new record, while the Amex composite added 0.29 to 394.65 and the
Nasdaq composite rose 0.59 to 667.12, another new all-time high. Turnover on
the NYSE was heavy at 235m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 994 to
821.
Enthusiasm was dampened in early trading by rumours that Germany might raise
interest rates. Although economists do not believe the Bundesbank would
raise rates, the rumours supported the view that German interest rates are
not likely to fall in the near future.
Otherwise, trading was dominated by technical considerations in the absence
of any domestic economic data. Following recent gains the market looked
slightly overbought, but underlying sentiment remained positive throughout
the day, and aided by a late surge in demand which some traders said was
linked to activity in the futures pits, shares put in another solid
performance. Boeing eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 5/8 in turnover of
almost 1m shares amid growing concern that the aircraft manufacturer would
be hit by industrial action following Monday night's vote by the Seattle
Professional Engineering Employees Association to reject a three-year
contract from Boeing. Talks were scheduled yesterday between management and
unions.
IBM fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 65 3/8 in busy trading after Merrill Lynch,
the broking house, warned that the computer maker might have to take
additional charges in the fourth quarter.
Various big stocks reacted to some late earnings reports. HJ Heinz firmed
Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 1/8 after announcing fiscal second quarter profits
of Dollars 154.2m, up from Dollars 122.8m at the same stage a year ago.
Deere&amp;Co jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 5/8 on news that the
agricultural equipment manufacturer earned Dollars 37.4m in the fourth
quarter ended October 31, a substantial turnround from the Dollars 20.2m
loss incurred at the same stage of 1991 (although that was affected by big
restructuring charges).
Times Mirror fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 30 3/4 on news that it expected to
take special charges against its fourth quarter earnings to cover costs
related to a restructuring at its Matthew Bender unit, a voluntary
separation programme at the Los Angeles Times, and changes in accounting
procedures.
General Motors climbed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 34 3/4 in turnover of 2.4m
shares after Kidder, Peabody, the broker, reiterated its 'buy'
recommendation and said the stock was due for a significant upward move over
the next few months.
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended mixed in continued heavy trading.
Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300-stock composite index lost 2.23
points, or 0.07 per cent, to 3,290.86, with declining issues ahead of
advances 340 to 277. Volume surged to 49,237,000 shares worth CDollars
456.1m.

FT  09 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains on late
institutional support

DEALERS and investment trusts supported share prices late in the day and the
Nikkei average gained marginally at the end of a quiet and cautious trading
session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 74.73 to 17,281.85 after a low of 17,135.81 and a
high of 17,332.70. The index fell during the first hour on small-lot
profit-taking, but later reversed its course on buying by public funds and
foreign investors.
Volume remained subdued at 180m shares against 140m. Advances led declines
by 549 to 373 with 163 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks gained 4.45 to 1,304.86 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
rose 1.85 to 1,055.42.
Companies bought shares for employee stock ownership plans, while public
funds gave support by placing buy orders just below market levels.
Most investors remained on the sidelines ahead of Friday's Bank of Japan's
tankan, or quarterly survey of business sentiment. They were also waiting
for a cabinet reshuffle, expected this weekend.
Meanwhile, Friday's settlement for futures and options December contracts is
generally expected to have little impact on share prices. Mr Masa Sato at SG
Warburg said that most of the large-lot futures players have already
adjusted positions and there has been little trading in December options
contract.
Large-capital, interest rate-sensitive stocks were sought on lower money
market rates. Kawasaki Steel was the most active issue of the day, rising Y3
to Y292, and Mitsubishi Heavy gained Y3 to Y548.
Housing issues rose on reports that the government was considering
implementing tax breaks for individuals who renovate houses. Daikyo gained
Y35 to Y770 and Misawa Homes rose Y30 to Y1,070.
Konami, the video game maker, advanced Y370 to Y3,280. High-tech toy makers
have recently been popular due to high earnings growth prospects.
Dealers targeted companies which expect a rise in profits in the current
year. Citizen Watch gained Y16 to Y931 and Suzuki Motor rose Y18 to Y833.
Sankyo, the pharmaceutical company, rose Y30 to Y2,430 on reports of plans
to market its diabetic drug next year. The company also expects a 25 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits for the current year to March.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 53.84 to 18,686.00 in volume of 21.7m
shares.

as institutional investors remained nervous about the longer-term prospects
for the colony. Indian stock markets remained closed because the unrest.

FT  09 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bad company reports hit senior
bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGATIVE announcements from the corporate sector upset German and French
equities yesterday. Milan, Vienna, Madrid and Lisbon were closed for a
religious holiday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT closed at its lowest level for nearly a month on the publication
of disappointing 10-month results from Deutsche Bank. The DAX index fell
17.08 to 1,508.24 as turnover rose to DM4.1bn from DM3bn.
News late on Monday night that Northwest Airlines had cancelled a Dollars
3.5bn order with the Airbus consortium, which includes Daimler, down DM8.60
at DM523, also depressed sentiment. However, Mr Michael Geiger at County
NatWest comments that the cancellation of the 74 aircraft represents only
4.5 per cent of the total order book and is therefore unlikely to have
serious long-term consequences for the consortium.
Deutsche, the last of the big banks to release its figures, had been
expected to turn in disappointing earnings but the 5 per cent decline was
below many forecasts and the shares dipped DM13.90 or 2 per cent to
DM653.10. Commerzbank eased DM2.20 to DM241.80 and Dresdner was DM2.70 lower
at DM350.80.
Dr Reinhard Fischer, head of German equities at Paribas in London, believes
that that overall the banking sector still offers growth potential in 1993.
He forecasts earnings growth of some 7 per cent for the banking sector next
year, against a rise of 5 per cent for other constituent companies of the
DAX index.
The engineering group Deutsche Babcock added DM2.30 to DM145.30 on news that
earnings would rise in the 1991/92 year and that it hoped to resume dividend
payments next year.
PARIS was dragged down by Elf which dropped 4.1 per cent following its
chairman's profit warning, published after the close on Monday. Elf, one of
the most heavily weighted stocks in the CAC-40 index, closed FFr14 lower at
FFr332 and the index fell 22.73 or 1.3 per cent to 1,765.88. Turnover was
steady at FFr1.9bn.
Other losers included Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, down FFr17 or 3.4 per cent
at FFr482 on news that it would inject FFr460m into its building subsidiary,
Dumez. Havas lost another FFr20 or 4.8 per cent to FFr401 in the wake of its
chairman's cautious trading statement on Monday.
Euro Disney jumped FFr1.7 or 3 per cent to FFr58.65. The stock has fallen to
a record low recently and there were reports that the US broker had bought
the shares aggressively yesterday morning as it closed out a bear position.
ZURICH closed firmer but below the day's highs as buying in the second round
of trading was not sufficient to offset earlier profit-taking on a weaker
dollar. The SMI added 7.7 to 1,962.2 after the day's high of 1,967.4.
Buying interest centred almost exclusively on blue chips, while second-tier
shares were under selling pressure. Ciba registered shares, SFr8 higher at
SFr596, topped the active list, followed by Roche PCs, SFr20 firmer at
SFr3,950. Schindler bearers fell SFr150 to SFr2,950.
AMSTERDAM saw further weakness in cyclicals as the CBS Tendency index closed
unchanged at 105.8. Among chemicals, DSM was Fl 1.40 down at Fl 80.50 and
Akzo Fl 2.00 lower at Fl 134.70.
Rodamco, the country's largest property investment group, shed Fl 1.20 to Fl
46.00 on news that its investment losses had widened in the first nine
months.
STOCKHOLM rose further as the bourse took its cue from advances on Wall
Street. The Affarsvarlden General index added 15.0 or 1.7 per cent to 886.4
in turnover of SKr579m after SKr451m.
The industrial group Incentive AB rose another SKr5 to SKr163 on the back of
a positive nine-month earnings report and the forecast of improved profits
in 1992, Volvo jumped SKr14 to SKr332.
The banking sector finished as the day's winner, up 5.8 per cent. S-E Banken
rose SKr0.50 to SKr16 while Handelsbanken added SKr1 to SKr33.
OSLO fell 1.8 per cent in reaction to recent strong gains fuelled by
speculation about a currency devaluation. The all-share index fell 6.68 to
369.53 in thin turnover of NKr183m.
Norsk Hydro closed NKr3.5 lower at NKr146.5 while Saga was down NKr1 at
NKr66.
HELSINKI closed higher for a third consecutive day and the HEX index rose
11.7 to 881.7.

FT  09 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: European shipbuilders face a brighter
future - But recovery is still some way off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European shipbuilders have been hit hard this year by a combination of
negative factors: a weak dollar, falling tanker rates and volatility in
European financial markets over economic convergence.
However, some analysts believe that the sector may be reaching the bottom of
the present cycle and forecast an upturn as the scrapping of older vessels
accelerates over the next few years, thereby reducing the present surplus
capacity.
Mr Ole Slorer, a transport analyst at County NatWest, says that the world's
VLCC tanker fleet (Very Large Crude Carriers ranging from 200,000 to 300,000
dead weight tonnes) has 'a heavily skewed age profile with some 50 per cent
of the fleet built in the 1972-1976 period'.
With a tanker having an average life of 20 years, Mr Slorer notes that 'once
scrapping commences the concentrated age profile will lead to a very rapid
contraction of tonnage'.
Kvaerner, Europe's largest shipbuilder and the fifth-largest in the world,
has seen its free shares slip from a year's high of NKr229 (Dollars 38) in
January to a low of NKr117 in early September. The price has come back
recently on the dollar's strength, closing at NKr135 yesterday.
However, some analysts believe that the group is in a good position to
benefit from a turnround in the sector. Its eight-month results were upset
by heavy losses in its mechanical engineering unit, while the shipbuilding
division, accounting for some 30 per cent of group sales, showed a healthy
46 per cent rise in profits to NKr494m.
The group's recent acquisition of the Warnow shipyard in east Germany has
strengthened its European network of yards and, says County NatWest, a
shipbuilding order book of NKr14bn 'puts Kvaerner in a position to achieve
substantial profits growth'.
Merrill Lynch notes that both Kvaerner's Finnish and Norwegian yards are now
operating profitably while the Govan shipyard in Scotland, bought from the
UK government in 1989, although still lossmaking, is showing signs of
improvement.
The broker concludes by arguing that the current p/e ratio of around 7 times
appears low and suggests that a multiple of 8 to 9 times 'would be more
appropriate for the group at this stage of the business cycle, implying a
price of around NKr180'.
Bremer Vulkan, Germany's largest marine technology and shipbuilder, is
forecast by some analysts to have the potential for a rapid growth in
earnings following a strategy of reorganisation and cost-cutting. Its recent
acquisition of the east German shipbuilder MTW is likely to increase its
shipbuilding capacity by some 50 per cent.
The group has also been diversifying further into marine electronics and
away from shipbuilding: the latter, which had accounted for 66 per cent of
sales in 1982, had fallen to 43 per cent by the end of 1991, and this trend
is set to continue.
The group has been helped, as with most European shipbuilders, by government
subsidies which are currently running at some DM30m-35m (Dollars 19m-22m)
year. It will also benefit from last month's announcement that subsidies to
the German industry are to virtually double next year.
Mr Alex Magona, German analyst at Map Securities in London, forecasts that
the group will resume dividend payments in 1993, coinciding with the the
company's centenary year, after a 16-year suspension.
However, the transport team at County NatWest is more cautious: while
acknowledging that the shipbuilding order book is healthy, 'high
profitability is unlikely until the second half of the decade,' it says,
rating the stock as neutral over the long term.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Short sterling rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT sterling recovered slightly from its oversold position but activity in
the money markets was dominated by technical trading yesterday, writes Peter
John.
The short sterling futures contract for March delivery opened marginally
weaker and was sold down to 93.25. Nevertheless, it had already begun to
look cheap on Monday night and it picked up 11 basis points from the open to
end at 93.39 by the official close with more than 14,500 contracts dealt. In
after hours trading it was sold back down to 93.30.
Meanwhile, French cash futures continued to drift down. On the Matif,
three-month Pibor for March delivery opened 5 lower at 91.25 and fell a
further 14 to 91.11 on heavy turnover of 18,000 contracts.
Bank of England operations were highlighted by a large forecast liquidity
shortage which failed to be completely taken out. Dealers said many banks
were unwilling to take up the latest repo offer which matures on January 5
because it carried over the year end and would upset balance sheets.
There were some concerns that, if the trend continues, a cumulative shortage
might develop in the very tight pre-Christmas market.
The Bank of England offered the money market an early round of assistance
after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.2bn.
Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of treasury
bills and paper maturing in official hands, expected to drain Pounds 302m,
bills for repurchase by the market, set to remove Pounds 691m, and bankers'
balances below target set to take up Pounds 425m. Partly offsetting these
were exchequer transactions which would add Pounds 140m to the market and a
fall in note circulation which would provide another Pounds 75m.
The Bank provided the money market with Pounds 108m of early assistance,
buying Pounds 33m of band one bank bills at the established 6 7/8 per cent
rate and Pounds 75m of bills for resale to the market on January 5 at an
interest rate of 6 15/16 per cent.
It provided a further Pounds 140m of assistance in the morning, buying
outright Pounds 50m of band two bank bills at 6 7/8 per cent and Pounds 90m
of bills for resale to the market on January 5 at an interest rate of 6
15/16 per cent. Finally, it provided about Pounds 305m of late, unspecified
assistance, bringing total help to Pounds 938m.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Thin trading distorts market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERY thin trading lent an air of unreality to foreign exchange markets
yesterday. The dollar was weak for much of the day in spite of more positive
economic data and sterling was strong with little to sustain it, writes
Peter John.
Dollar enthusiasts must be wondering what the US has to do to inject life
into the currency. Almost every day has seen a new release of encouraging US
data and yet the dollar has failed to respond.
Yesterday, the National Association of Purchasing Managers said the outlook
for US Christmas retail sales was brighter than at any time since 1989.
In the NAPM's semi-annual economic outlook, 36 per cent of the 300 firms
surveyed said they expected sales to be good, compared to 10 per cent who
expected them to be poor, an exact reverse of last year.
Nevertheless, the dollar extended Monday's three-pfennig slide opening
mildly softer against most significant currencies. Dealers who had been long
for some time liquidated their positions in order to balance the books for
the year end.
The moves were exacerbated because some smaller houses have already stopped
trading for the year and the market is exceptionally tight.
There was also a belief that some central banks were selling dollars to buy
D-Marks, which they will need to repay the short-term refinancing provided
by the Bundesbank around Black Wednesday.
The dollar eased to DM1.5570 against DM1.5685 previously and fell against
the pound to Dollars 1.5970 against Dollars 1.5875 and against the Yen to
Y123.95 from Y124.40.
Sterling was the subject of opposite pressures. Many dealers who had left
themselves short following the financial swings in mid-September have been
buying back the pound. One economist said there was no fundamental incentive
as the UK economy was still in recession, the deficit was about to reach
'horrible proportions' and the current account was deteriorating. He
predicted that when the end of year distortions were removed the pound would
fall back.
The pound was a further half pfennig stronger around midday but it flinched
at the DM2.50 barrier and closed only marginally stronger against the German
currency at DM2.4900.
Pressures on the franc returned but, once again, technical position-taking
was seen as the motor. The slide to FFr3.410 against the D-Mark from
FFr3.408 was not backed by any significant volume and not seen as a cause
for concern.
The Guilder was very firm against the D-Mark and many dealers were looking
for a rate cut. However, the Dutch central bank said in the afternoon that
it was maintaining its advances rate at 8.7 per cent.
The Swiss franc closed stronger against the German currency returning to
trade within the ERM range following several days of nervousness because of
Switzerland's rejection of the European Economic Area.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (12): Protectionism rules in the provinces
 -Theresa Byrne on doing business in Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THERESA BYRNE

<TEXT>
CANADIANS still talk about the incident in Aylmer, Quebec, in the mid-1980s.
A long muddy trench lay beside a road where workers had installed and then
demolished a new brick pavement. There was nothing wrong with the sidewalk.
But in Quebec, pavement materials must be made in Quebec - and the bricks
for this pavement had come from Ontario.
The contractor was forced to rip up and replace the offending stones.
The Aylmer story is still cited to illustrate the absurdities of doing
business in Canada. At a time when barriers to international trade are being
dismantled, Canadian industry continues to struggle with a plethora of
inter-provincial trade barriers. Even the federal government fought
unsuccessfully earlier this year to include a ban on provincial trade
barriers in the constitutional reform package.
'What you're really talking about is how governments use their power,' said
Mr Robert Knox, director general of policy services in the department of
industry, science and technology.
The provinces are barred from imposing customs tariffs under Section 121 of
the Constitution Act 1867, which says: 'All articles of the Growth, Produce,
or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall . . . be admitted free into
each of the other Provinces.'
But non-tariff barriers have proliferated over the years. In a 1991 study,
the Canadian Manufacturers' Association (CMA) lists a succession of barriers
which hamper the free movement of goods, services and people. For example, a
manufacturer of diesel buses was awarded a contract to supply vehicles to a
Quebec municipality, but only on condition that the Ontario production
facilities be moved to Quebec. This duly happened, displacing several
hundred Ontario workers.
Other obstacles to trade among the 10 provinces and two territories include
provincial marketing boards, different licensing requirements for lawyers
and doctors, and subsidies to attract investment.
The CMA estimated the provinces have erected about 500 such barriers at a
cost to the economy of more than CDollars 6bn a year. The CMA called for a
progressive elimination of the barriers by 1993, but now accepts that the
process will take much longer.
'Lack of political will, based on people maintaining a very parochial and
short-sighted attitude,' has hindered progress, says Mr Stephen Van Houten,
the association's president. Business leaders acknowledge that liberalising
trade would result in plant closures and lost jobs in the short term. But
they are confident that it would have substantial long-term benefits.
The issue of inter-provincial barriers has been tackled on and off since a
Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations noted in 1940 that 'it is
probable that there is no single province so situated as to gain on balance
by the existence of local protectionism in Canada'.
A more recent thrust began in 1987, with the formation of a committee of
federal and provincial ministers on internal trade. It was charged with
identifying barriers, and working with industry to reduce and remove them
through negotiation and mediation.
Initially, it set out to tackle three areas: government procurement, liquor
marketing and transport regulation. A little progress has been made. In
November 1991, all governments approved an agreement on government
procurement which will eliminate preferential treatment on most purchases of
more than CDollars 25,000.
The new system, which is to be phased in by 1996, does not cover services or
construction, nor does it include purchases for crown corporations,
municipalities, schools and hospitals.
An agreement on beer was implemented earlier this year. Under the old rules,
brewers could normally sell their beer only in provinces where it was
brewed. In November 1992, agriculture ministers agreed to eliminate
technical rules, such as different meat and vegetable grading standards. So
many regulations are involved that eliminating them could take up to five
years.
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have
agreed among themselves to allow companies from all four provinces to bid on
most government contracts in the region. On a national level, the current
priority is to bring down procurement barriers in services and construction.
But the provinces are now taking a different approach. Instead of trying to
eliminate one barrier at a time, they are now devising a common set of
standards and principles to which all provinces would adhere. In the
meantime, Mr Van Houten plans to continue lobbying against the patchwork of
barriers that remain. 'Hope springs eternal,' he says.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (10): US joint venture - Profile of Maple
Leaf Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEAR pattern runs through the shake-up which Hillsdown Holdings has given
Maple Leaf Foods in the two and a half years since the British conglomerate
bought control of Canada's biggest food processor.
'From day one in restructuring this business, we looked at it to be
cost-competitive on a North American basis and not on a Canadian basis,'
says Mr Art Devlin, a senior vice-president who is the only senior manager
to have survived Hillsdown's medicine.
Known as a lumbering corporate dinosaur in its former incarnation as Canada
Packers, Maple Leaf is now blazing the trail which many other Canadian
companies will have to follow if they are to survive and prosper in a more
competitive environment.
In a strategy typical of many other industries, Maple Leaf's US competitors
no longer treat Canada as part of their foreign operations but as an
extension of their domestic market. The US food companies are stepping up
their drive into Canada.
Imports of prepared meats and other products have risen markedly as tariff
barriers are lowered under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement. As Mr
Devlin puts it, 'the economic borders are disappearing. We tend to think of
our businesses now as geographic regions running north-south, rather than
east-west.'
Maple Leaf sold its dairy and edible oils businesses after realising that
they were too small to go head-to-head against the giants of the North
American industry. Beef-slaughtering became less attractive when Cargill put
up a huge new facility in Alberta, and the provincial government started
propping up smaller, inefficient producers.
A large broom has been swept through Maple Leaf's remaining businesses -
such as poultry, prepared meats, groceries, milling and baking. It has
closed some plants, combined production at others and, in a few cases, made
acquisitions to achieve economies of scale.
Stiffer competition and the recession have not left the company unscathed,
however. Earnings per share from continuing operations edged up by a modest
5 per cent in the first six months of 1992. But the Canadian company is at
least lean enough now to start holding its own against the US giants, not
just in Canada, but also on their own turf.
Significantly, when Hillsdown picked a new chief executive officer for Maple
Leaf last April, its choice was Mr Charles Bowen, who has spent much of his
career with General Foods of the US. Mr Bowen's priorities include expansion
south of the 49th Parallel.
A milestone in the cross-border strategy was a 50-50 joint venture set up
earlier this year with ConAgra, the US food processor. Maple Leaf has
contributed its entire milling and baking mix business, while ConAgra has
chipped in a large mill in Buffalo, New York.
ConAgra manages the venture, enabling the Canadian businesses to benefit
from the economies of scale of ConAgra's payroll, data processing and
purchasing departments. For its part, ConAgra has stepped up its purchases
from the Canadian flour mills. Maple Leaf is now examining the feasibility
of expanding the partnership to other products, and perhaps forming similar
ventures with other US companies.
It already exports about a third of its fresh pork output to the US. Bread,
pasta, frozen dough, prepared meats and animal feeds are among other
products which are finding a market south of the border. Rather than take on
heavyweight US brands, however, Maple Leaf is putting the emphasis on
private-label business where it can compete on price and quality without a
hefty marketing budget.
With no debt on its books, Maple Leaf can afford a substantial acquisition
in the US. But here, too, the Canadian company is aware of its limitations.
Rather than trying to be a national brand-name player, it is looking for
regional, perhaps family-owned, companies.
What Maple Leaf would most like to find is a little-noticed company with a
franchise as strong and a management as weak as Canada Packers had when its
new British shareholders came on the scene two years ago.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (11): Quebec seeks to restore its vitality
 -Robert Gibbens on prospects for the country's only French-speaking
province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the constitutional referendum behind it, Quebec is marshalling all its
energies in the hope of restoring the economic vitality of the 1980s.
Most voters in Canada's only French-speaking province are well satisfied
that Quebec was among six provinces which voted No in the October
referendum. But now they want the constitutional issue shelved, pending next
year's federal election.
'I was very disappointed Canada did not grasp the opportunity to accept the
Charlottetown package,' says Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier. 'But
Quebec's 56 per cent No clearly was not a vote for independence - that's
crucial. Everybody now agrees we must move on to other urgent matters and
try to spur our lagging economy.'
Quebec and Ontario, with two-thirds of Canada's 26.5m population and most of
its manufacturing base, have been most severely affected by the recession.
Sagging primary product prices, especially for forest products and metals,
declining construction and lower protective tariffs have sharpened the pain
for Quebec. Only recently have lower interest rates and a lower Canadian
dollar brought relief.
Quebec's unemployment persists at an average 12.5 per cent, with pockets of
20 per cent in some areas. The property crisis rivals Ontario's and
retailing has been decimated. Provincial and municipal deficits have swollen
in the past two years, taxes are up and services are down.
Signs of US recovery are encouraging, says Mr Bourassa, but he feels that
any stimulus from the Clinton administration's economic policies will not be
felt in Quebec before 1994. The pace of recovery may be slow.
Quebec urgently needs a stable dollar and lower interest rates to revive
profits, encourage investment and create jobs, he says. It remains fully
open to North America and the world for trade and investment.
The government is trying to forge a new partnership with business to meet
the challenge of market globalisation, mobility of production and growing
competition.
'Restructuring of Quebec's economy is in full swing and we must create the
new jobs in the high value-added sectors,' says Mr Pierre Pettigrew, a
management consultant helping companies to cope with the challenges of the
1990s.
'Government must become more competitive and entrepreneurial and help to
find partners for Quebec's growth sectors in other provinces and abroad.
Montreal must become a great North American city again. We have a chance to
break with the past.'
The government wants to use the Dollars 42bn Caisse de Depot, the investment
arm for the Quebec Pension Plan, to speed the transition and foster growth.
Other business groups, from the Desjardins financial services giant, the
commercial banks and industry associations to Reseau du Capital de Risque, a
group formed to expand channels for venture capital, are joining in.
The private sector is confident that many companies can compete globally,
especially in the US. More than 70 per cent of Quebec's exports go to the
US. Quebec's comparative advantage in some sectors can be used to foster
foreign investment and exports, says Mr Charles Perrault, president of
Schroder Investments Canada and a director of Northern Telecom.
A German-led consortium brought the US Dollars 1bn Alouette aluminium
smelter on stream at Sept Iles this summer on time and on budget. According
to Mr Perrault, 'the economics may rest on power and a year-round port, but
it was the young and well-educated workforce that made the smooth start-up
possible. Quebec has come a long way in 30 years and education has
dramatically changed the outlying regions.'
The government plans improvements to industrial training, with the help of a
new agreement with Ottawa. In the longer term, secondary education is to be
revamped to adapt the workforce to the 1990s.
Mr Bourassa has promised a more competitive corporate tax burden, but
business wants heavy cutbacks in the civil service to lower the high cost of
government. Public sector pay, long a strong inflationary factor, has been
capped, but business complains that the government has lost control of costs
in the industrial health and safety system. These are borne mainly by
employers.
Quebec has five or six competitive sectors with good growth prospects:
aerospace and transport equipment, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications and
information technology, power generation equipment, metals and food
processing. The province is promoting these with research and development
programmes, tax credits, loans and infrastructure projects. All draw heavily
on greater Montreal's skilled manpower - the region contains half of
Quebec's total population of 6.5m and has a full range of financial and
legal services in French, English and several other languages.
The leaders include Bombardier, BCE, Merck Frosst Canada, CAE Industries,
Alsthom, Alcan Aluminium and Noranda, all international companies. Mr Gerard
Tremblay, the industry minister, is also focusing on petrochemicals,
textiles and clothing, pulp and paper, environmental products and some
cultural industries, encouraging initiative from the regions.
Mr Jacques Parizeau, leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois, has attacked
the government's ability to shape effective policies for recovery. Mr
Parizeau, whose party is trying to capitalise on the No vote in the
referendum, argues that the federal government retains too many levers.
He has promised a referendum on sovereignty if he can win the next
provincial election, which is likely to be held in 1994. On the other hand,
even the PQ knows that Quebec cannot isolate itself.
The language issue is confined to Montreal because of its pluralistic
make-up. The government would like to ease a contentious ban on
English-language exterior commercial signs late in 1993. But this will be
done only if francophones, accounting for 75 per cent of the city's 3m
population, feel secure that they will be able to continue to live and work
in a French environment.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (8): Free trade is no longer such a hot
potato - Commercial ties with the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA), now nearing its fourth
anniversary, has already had a profound impact on commercial ties between
the world's two largest trading partners.
Measuring that impact with any degree of precision is impossible. The first
three years of the FTA have coincided with a recession, volatile exchange
rates and low commodity prices, all of which have also helped alter trade
flows and investment strategies.
But a recent study by Toronto's CD Howe Institute concluded that 'the facts
so far are more consistent with the optimistic scenario of free trade
supporters than with the views of detractors.'
The supporters have taken heart from rising two-way trade, especially in
products liberalised by the agreement, as well as many examples of new US
investment in Canada.
Evidence of the FTA's popularity in the business community is the mountain
of applications which have poured into Ottawa and Washington for two rounds
of accelerated tariff cuts which have been negotiated since 1989 on two-way
trade of some CDollars 8bn a year. A third - and final - round will come
into force early in 1993.
Critics of the FTA, chiefly the labour movement, point to hard-pressed
Canadian industries, such as furniture, carpets, textiles and processed
foods, which are struggling to compete against rising US imports.
The FTA has been blamed for a rash of plant closures in Canada. Some US
companies have discovered that, without customs tariffs to consider, they
can service the Canadian market more efficiently from plants south of the
border. Some Canadian manufacturers, especially in the automotive parts
industry, have also moved to the US.
One undisputed benefit of the 1989 pact, however, is its innovative dispute
settlement mechanism. The new system of referring disagreements to
binational review panels has taken much of the political heat out of
anti-dumping and countervailing duty issues.
Canadian trade officials are also convinced that the binding arbitration
system has made the US Department of Commerce and International Trade
Commission more careful in applying trade-remedy laws.
A total of 33 panels has been set up over the past three years, the bulk of
them to review anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases involving products
as diverse as softwood lumber, magnesium, pigs and paving machinery.
Five of the panels, set up under Chapter 18 of the FTA, have dealt with
intractable government-to-government disputes. They have included a Canadian
challenge on the US interpretation of rules of origin for cars assembled in
Canada, and a US complaint against Canadian landing rules for west coast
salmon and herring. Two Chapter 18 cases, involving farm subsidies and UHT
milk standards, are pending.
The next big step in US-Canada trade relations will be the expansion of free
trade to Mexico under the North American free trade agreement (Nafta), which
is due to come into force on January 1 1994. The Mulroney government expects
to present enabling legislation to parliament in early 1993.
While public opinion in Canada remains lukewarm on free trade, the Nafta
agreement is not as hot a political potato as the FTA was four years ago.
The opposition Liberal party, which strongly opposed the FTA, has come
around to much the same view as US President-elect Bill Clinton - that Nafta
has flaws, but they are not so serious that the whole agreement should be
ditched.
Canada's goals in the Nafta negotiations were largely defensive. Only a
relatively small number of Canadian exporters and investors will benefit
from improved access to Mexico. Ottawa was more anxious to preserve (and if
possible, improve on) gains made in the FTA, and to ensure that Canada would
remain attractive as a springboard for investors into the North American
market.
Canadian officials identify five key areas where Nafta differs from the FTA:
clearer rules of origin, which the Canadians expect will avoid a repetition
of the dispute earlier this year over the North American content of Honda
Civic cars made in Canada.
the extension for two years, to 1996, of duty drawbacks on inputs for motor
vehicles made in Canada and then shipped to the US. Permanent duty drawback
concessions will apply to products which are shipped from one Nafta country
to another but do not meet North American rules of origin. Under Nafta,
companies will be entitled to a refund of the customs duty on either the
input or the finished product, whichever is lower.
liberalisation of cross-border transport. Under Nafta, trucks will be
allowed to pick up loads in all three countries.
looser government procurement rules. Among the US business which will be
opened to Canadian companies are services, construction and para-statals
such as the US Army Corps of Engineers. Canadian officials estimate that
Nafta opens as much as CDollars 50bn of new US government business to
Canadian bidders.
Expanded intellectual property rights, notably protection of patents and
copyright in Mexico.
Despite the improvements, Nafta still leaves numerous gaps in commercial
ties between the three countries. Subsidies and anti-dumping rules, which
the FTA negotiators hoped would be resolved in the multilateral Uruguay
Round, will remain contentious issues.
The Canadians are also nervous that many Mexican officials will find it
difficult to adjust to the disciplines required by a detailed international
trade agreement, especially one which overrides domestic laws.
Within Canada, pressure is likely to grow on Ottawa to provide more generous
assistance to industries and workers hit by intensifying competition from US
and now Mexican suppliers. The CD Howe Institute concluded that 'the painful
restructuring that has occurred in certain sectors under the FTA suggests
that the issue of adjustment programmes should be revisited'.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (7): There are some flies in the Nafta
ointment - Will new foreign investors be wooed if old ones move away?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the drive towards an integrated North American market gathers pace,
Canada's toughest challenge is to hang on to foreign investors with a
presence north of the 49th Parallel, and at the same time attract new ones.
The elimination of customs duties under the 1989 US-Canada free trade
agreement has led many US companies to look on Canada not as a foreign
market with its own branch plants but as a part of their domestic
operations. All too often, this has meant closing factories in Canada and
serving Canadian customers from giant, low-cost plants south of the border.
The trilateral North American free trade agreement (Nafta), which is due to
take effect in January 1994, will also pit Canada against Mexico in wooing
new investment, especially from the US.
Professor Alan Rugman, of the University of Toronto's faculty of management,
concluded in a recent paper that the terms of the Nafta bring only 'modest
actual gains in terms of a liberalisation of the North American investment
regime'. But as Prof Rugman put it, 'American investors considering
investments outside the US now have two countries to choose from which both
ensure easy trade access to the US market.'
Of the three countries, Canada has most to lose. It has a small, widely
dispersed market, most of it within easy reach of US factories. High wages
make it likely that labour-intensive industries would choose Mexico or the
southern US.
Canadian business is also burdened by high taxes. According to a recent OECD
report, tax revenues have soared from 31.6 per cent of gross domestic
product in 1980 to 39.4 per cent in 1991, higher than either Britain or
Germany, and well above the US.
The Canadians are confident, however, that they have much to offer. Mrs Jean
McCloskey, president of Investment Canada, the federal investment promotion
and review agency, observes that the relatively high wages, taxes and other
costs of operating in Canada do not necessarily mean low profits.
Canada's advantages include a skilled workforce, first-rate infrastructure
and a sophisticated market, not to mention the public health-care system for
which a sizeable chunk of taxes is earmarked.
The country's abundant natural resources continue to attract many companies.
Several international mining groups, for instance, have recently joined a
stampede for diamonds in the Northwest Territories. Foreign investors have
also been active buyers of oil and gas properties in western Canada.
But Canada's best hope for the future may lie in more sophisticated
businesses. Investment Canada has targeted a handful of sectors, including
computer software, hazardous waste, marine technology and optics. It is
about to add medical devices, telecommunications and water treatment to the
list.
The agency has identified about 700 Canadian companies in these fields which
are interested in joining forces with a foreign partner. Recent successes
include a decision by Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, to
locate its cellular software development centre in Montreal, in the face of
competition from the company's US and Mexican subsidiaries. Plant Genetic
Systems of Belgium plans to invest a total of CDollars 10m in Saskatchewan
to develop a strain 87.
With Canada's unemployment rate at over 11 per cent foreign investors can
expect a warm welcome from federal and provincial governments. Interest-free
loans smoothed the way for both Ericsson and the UK's Rolls-Royce, which
recently decided to produce an industrial version of one of its turbofan
aero engines near Montreal.
Screening by Investment Canada is now limited to direct purchases of
businesses with assets of more than CDollars 5m, or indirect acquisitions
(those where ownership of a Canadian business changes as a result of the
acquisition of its foreign parent) involving assets of more than CDollars
50m.
Under the US-Canada free trade pact, however, the threshold for direct US
investors has been raised to CDollars 150m. Indirect acquisitions by US
buyers are now usually exempt from review. Indeed, since its formation in
1985, Investment Canada has never turned down a proposal.
Nonetheless, foreign investors in some high-profile, politically sensitive
sectors need a good deal of agility and patience if their plans are to come
to fruition.
Foreign control in the 'cultural' sector, which includes publishing, films,
broadcasting and music, is especially frowned on. Public opinion  - and thus
political decision-making - is also sensitive to foreign involvement in
financial services and airlines.
The recent experience of Dallas-based American Airlines shows, however, that
hard times have softened Canadian attitudes. American ran into stiff
opposition from trade unions and politicians when it proposed earlier this
year to buy 25 per cent (the maximum allowed by law) in Canadian Airlines
International of Calgary. The opposition evaporated, however, when it became
clear that the alternatives were either a costly merger for Canadian with
Air Canada or bankruptcy.
In spite of the improved climate for foreign investment, there are some
clouds on the horizon. One is a possible change of government after the
federal election to be held next year.
The opposition Liberal party has yet to spell out a clear investment policy.
Under Mr Pierre Trudeau, the former prime minister, the Liberals spearheaded
a plethora of new curbs on foreigners in the 1970s and early 1980s.
A group of pragmatists within the party is pushing hard for a less
nationalistic platform. Significant new restrictions are unlikely, at least
in the early years of a Liberal government. But with Ottawa and the
provinces facing growing budget deficits, higher taxes may be on the way, no
matter which government is in office.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (9): Hundreds of barriers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE roughly 500 trade barriers which impede the movement of goods and
services between Canada's 10 provinces range from the familiar to the
obscure. They include:

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (6): Mercury link may be only a start -
Profile of BCE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIMITED growth opportunities and stiffening competition at home are driving
many Canadian companies to broaden their horizons. Among the most prominent
is BCE, the Montreal-based telecommunications and financial services group.
BCE's latest foray abroad was its purchase in mid-November of a 20 per cent
stake in Mercury Communications, Britain's second-biggest telephone company.
As part of the deal, Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent, is to become a
partner in BCE's cable TV business in the UK.
'We were interested in getting closer to a company which had geographical
reach,' says Mr Red Wilson, BCE's president. 'I see it as the beginning of
an alliance where, we hope, C&amp;W and ourselves are going to have a lot to do
in common in the future.'
BCE already has a sizeable international presence through its 53 per cent
stake in Northern Telecom, the telecommunications equipment maker. Thanks
largely to its acquisition last year of Britain's STC, Northern now makes
more than a fifth of its sales outside North America.
BCE itself is part of a consortium which set up Clear Communications, New
Zealand's second phone company; one of its executives is Clear's general
manager. The Canadian company owns 49 per cent of a fledgling digital
telephone network in Moscow, and a subsidiary has cellular franchises in
Mexico City and New Delhi.
BCE's international thrust is driven by the limited opportunities on its
home turf. It is already Canada's biggest public company, with annual
revenues of about CDollars 20bn, and the only one to have posted net
earnings of more than a billion dollars a year. Its cash cow, wholly-owned
Bell Canada, has a virtual monopoly on phone services to the 15m residents
of Ontario and Quebec, and has stakes in several other provincial telephone
companies.
Bell's dominance of the domestic market makes further expansion difficult
within Canada. At the same time, regulatory barriers which have protected
provincial phone utilities from competition are gradually being lowered.
A rival long-distance service is currently being set up and cut-price
resellers are gaining an ever bigger share of corporate telephone business.
Mr Wilson says that Bell is earmarking a growing slice of its resources to
marketing.
Getting a toehold in the international telephone business has not been easy.
BCE's US partner pulled out at the last minute of a bid for a stake in
Telefonos de Mexico; a bid with Bell Atlantic (no relation to Bell Canada)
in the privatisation of Venezuela's phone company was also unsuccessful.
BCE hopes the alliance with Cable &amp; Wireless will give it the long-sought
springboard into the international telephone business. The chairmen and
chief executives of the two companies plan to get together twice a year to
explore opportunities.
They have yet to discuss specific joint ventures. But Mr Wilson says that
both companies recognise that south-east Asia 'is one part of the world
where we can work together'.
A senior Bell Canada man is to take over the reins of one of Mercury's
divisions and Mr Wilson expects that half-a-dozen operating people will be
seconded to Mercury at any one time. 'We wanted to be sure we would be an
active player in Mercury and not just an investor,' he says.
BCE has laid the groundwork for its international telecoms thrust by
retreating from other businesses. It expects to raise about CDollars 650m
before the end of the year as warrants on its remaining shares in
TransCanada PipeLines are exercised. Another CDollars 142m came recently
from the sale of two US telephone directory advertising firms.
A wholly-owned trust company, Montreal Trust, will probably end up as part
of a larger financial institution.
BCE's problem child remains an ill-advised investment which it made in a
large property developer in the mid-1980s. It wrote off its 67 per cent
equity stake in BF Realty (previously known as BCE Development) three years
ago, but continues to have a debt exposure of over CDollars 400m to the
near-bankrupt company's principal subsidiary.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (5): Handicaps that are hard to overcome -
Bernard Simon looks at the competitive weaknesses of the country's companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE slump in consumer demand and the longer jobless queues which have marked
the present recession are arguably the least worrying part of Canada's
economic problems.
While the business cycle is expected to turn gradually upward during 1993,
Canadian companies will still be hobbled by more fundamental handi- caps
which, without corrective action, could keep living standards on the skids
for years to come.
These structural weaknesses - which include inadequate research and
development, poor worker training, advers- arial industrial relations, high
taxes and inter-provincial trade barriers - have come to be lumped under the
heading of 'competitiveness'.
Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School concluded in a
report commissioned by the federal government last year that evidence,
ranging from a weak base in machinery exports to high foreign ownership of
Canadian industry, points to 'an economy that shows lim- ited signs of
upgrading, and suggests that productivity growth - the critical driver of
prosperity - may be increas- ingly difficult to achieve.'
Views along the same lines have been aired ad nauseam in recent years. But
concerted action to correct Canada's competitive handicaps has so far proved
elusive.
Dr Sylvia Ostry, chairman of the Centre for International Studies at the
University of Toronto, noted in a recent speech that 'there seems to be in
this country virtually no recognition in the general public and among many
polit- icians of the need for a furnace to generate the 'warmth' for this
kinder, gentler country to survive the wintry blasts of global competition.'
Mr Michael Bloom, a researcher at the Conference Board of Canada in Ottawa,
puts some of the blame on a difference in attitude between Canadians and
Americans. While Americans aggressively strive for excellence, their
northern neighbours put greater emphasis on equity and equality.
As Mr Bloom notes, Canada has no Harvard or Sorbonne among its universities.
Instead, Ottawa and the prov- inces spend a large chunk of their budgets to
ensure that uniform services, which meet 'national standards', are
accessible throughout the world's second biggest country.
Concern about Canada's eroding competitiveness is increasingly homing in on
the country's schools and univers- ities. At first glance, Canada should
have one of the world's finest education systems. No government in the
industrial world spends more on a pupil's pre-matriculation educ- ation.
Teachers' salaries are 40 per cent higher on average in Canada than the US.
But Statistics Canada has estimated that some 28 per cent of Canada-born
people, aged 16-24, are functionally illiterate and over 40 per cent are
innumerate. Canadian students come near the bottom of the list among OECD
coun- tries in science and mathem- atics skills. Enrolment in post-
secondary engineering and applied science courses has tumbled since the
mid-1980s.
The list of possible explan- ations for this poor record is a long one.
Canadian univers- ities have an ultra-short academic year, with students
normally starting classes in mid-September and writing their exams by the
end of April.
School teachers enjoy the protection of a strong union movement, while many
university lecturers are coddled by a system of permanent tenure.
In any case, Mr Bloom notes that many teachers are forced to spend more of
their time in the classroom these days on social issues - such as Aids and
drugs counselling, and violence in schools - at the expense of the academic
syllabus.
Concern for equity and equality can conflict with pursuit of excellence. For
instance, the municipality of Ottawa-Carleton has six different school
boards, catering for French-speaking and English-speaking children from
Protestant and Catholic backgrounds. No fewer than four departments in the
Ontario provincial government have responsibility for some aspect of
education.
Among the top priorities of the education reform movement is a drive towards
national testing. The hope is that a comparison of the achievements of
pupils from schools across the country will be a powerful spur to improving
academic standards.
The provinces conducted a limited trial test of literacy and numeracy skills
last June. The plan is to broaden the test to cover about 20,000 pupils at
the end of the 1992/93 school year.
Sceptics question however, whether such products of negotiation and
compromise are radical enough to give government, business and workers the
jolt they need.
Canada's best hope of improving its competitiveness, they contend, is more
likely to come from sharp external shocks, such as North American free
trade, or another crunch in the natural resource markets on which the
country has always depended for growth in the past.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (3): Bank governor is hero after fall in
inflation - The upturn is expected to be slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN CROW, the Bank of Canada's forthright governor, has been transformed
over the past two years from national villain to national hero. The villains
these days are spendthrift politicians whose inability to contain budget
deficits has cast a cloud over Canada's economic prospects.
In 1990-91, Mr Crow bore the brunt of complaints from business, trade unions
and politicians that high interest rates and a soaring currency were
ravaging the Canadian economy.
More recently however, the UK-raised, former IMF economist has been showered
with compliments for squeezing Canada's inflation rate down to the lowest
among G7 countries, forcing business to pay more attention to its
productivity, and adroitly steering Canada through the turbulence on world
currency markets.
Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, has slowed to an annual
rate of little more than 1 per cent, down from 5.6 per cent in 1991 and 4.8
per cent the previous year. This easily beats inflation targets set by the
government in early 1991.
Local economists have nicknamed the central bank the 'Bundesbank of the
North.' Mr Crow insisted in a recent speech that his highest priority
remains monetary stability. 'This goal is good for expectations, good for
markets, good for savers and investors, and therefore good for sustained
recovery in the Canadian economy,' he said.
But guiding the economy towards a smooth, non-inflationary recovery will not
be easy. The success of monetary policy in recent years masks a disturbing
deterioration in the state of Canada's public finances.
'The Bank of Canada has no antidote for fiscal problems in this country,'
says Mr Warren Jestin, Bank of Nova Scotia's chief economist.
Profligacy during the last boom, especially in Ontario, has been compounded
during the recession by a slump in tax revenues and heavier demands for
government services, especially social welfare and unemployment insurance.
Bank of Nova Scotia estimates that public sector deficits now amount to
about 8 per cent of national income, among the highest in the G7.
The federal government has missed one deficit reduction target after another
and will almost certainly fail to achieve this year's goal of a CDollars
27.5bn shortfall. The final outcome is now expected to be closer to CDollars
33-34bn.
Provincial governments have held their fiscal reins even more loosely.
According to Burns Fry, the Toronto securities firm, borrowing by the 10
provinces has surged from CDollars 17bn in the fiscal year to March 31 1988
to an estimated CDollars 33bn in 1992-93.
The provinces' combined borrowings overtook the federal government's for the
first time last year. The public sector deficits have become a painful
political headache. Canadians are already heavily taxed.
The uproar over the introduction of a 7 per cent Goods and Services Tax two
years ago and subsequent revolts against higher municipal rates are signs
that taxpayers' tolerance is wearing thin. On the other hand, the scope for
paring government spending in the depths of a recession is limited.
If anything, pressure is now building on Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime
minister, to loosen the purse-strings, especially with the general election
drawing near in 1993. Although interest rates have come down a long way from
their mid-1990 peaks, they remain unusually h i g h a f t e r f a c t o r i
n g in the slide in inflation.
The yield on long-term government bonds stood at 8.6 per cent in
mid-November, giving a 'real' interest rate of over 7 per cent.
The Bank of Canada has indicated in recent months that it is willing to
allow the Canadian dollar to slide a little faster to accommodate a further
drop in interest rates. The currency fell below 79 US cents in mid-November
for the first time in five years, down from almost 84 cents in early
September. Burns Fry predicts that the dollar could slide as low as 75 US
cents by the end of 1993.
With policymakers having so little room for manoeuvre, economists are
virtually unanimous that the upturn will be slow. Real growth in gross
domestic product is expected to be around 1.5 per cent this year, compared
to the 2.7 per cent forecast by Mr Donald Mazankowski, the finance minister,
in his budget last February.
Next year's growth rate is unlikely to exceed about 3.5 per cent. The
chances are slim that unemployment, currently at over 11 per cent, will
return to single digits before late 1993.
The main engines for growth are expected to include exports, which will be
spurred by the more favourable exchange rate and a recovery in the US; and
housing, which will benefit from lower interest rates. Canada Mortgage and
Housing Corp predicts that housing starts will rise to 179,000 units in
1993, from 166,000 this year.
The outlook varies widely from province to province. British Columbia, whose
growth is compared by the business community to California in the 1950s and
1960s, is enjoying robust expansion as immigrants and investment stream in,
and the forestry industry shows signs of revival.
Prospects in neighbouring Alberta depend largely on oil and gas prices, and
the international grain market.
At the other extreme of the country (and the growth spectrum), Newfoundland
is struggling to cope with a moratorium on cod fishing. About one in five
Newfoundlanders is out of work, and the province's economy has shrunk by
about 2 per cent this year.
Ontario and Quebec, the two most industrialised provinces and among those
hardest hit by the recession, are expected to mirror the national picture,
emerging only slowly and fitfully from the slump of the past three years.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (1): Adjusting to realities - Hopes that
the past few years' political and economic turbulence is over have been
buoyed by early signs of business recovery and the conclusion of a North
American free trade deal. But the future is not yet assured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE are two ways of sizing up Canada as one of the more eventful years in
its recent history draws to a close.
One view is that this is a country whose best years have passed; a society
which has grown fat and lazy, and become so preoccupied with parochial
squabbling that it has lost sight of the cut-throat world beyond its
borders.
The other view is that Canadians have begun to sit up and take notice of the
challenges facing them. They are anxious to put aside the constitutional
wrangle of the past few years, and to get to grips with the economic
problems which threaten their enviable standard of living. If this is true,
Canada's best years could yet lie ahead.
Evidence abounds to support both scenarios. On the one hand, Quebec
separatists, regional forces in western Canada and other special interest
groups have been emboldened by the voters' decisive rejection in a
referendum last October of a constitutional deal which was supported by
almost all the country's mainstream politicians.
This political fragmentation could be reinforced in the next general
election, which is likely to be called for the late summer or early autumn
of 1993.
A strong showing by the separatist Bloc Quebecois and by the western-based
Reform Party would deprive either of the two main parties, the Progressive
Conservatives (who have been in office for the past eight years) or the
Liberals, of a clear mandate. A minority government would probably be
distracted from urgent economic and social issues by the political juggling
needed to stay in office.
On the economic front, the world is no longer beating a path to Canada's
door for raw materials. British Columbia's spruce and cedar forests may
still be among the finest in the world, but buyers can find trees which grow
much faster elsewhere these days, and are cut and processed by cheap,
non-union labour.
Tough environmental laws and other forms of bureaucratic red tape have made
Canada less attractive to mining companies than it used to be. The rich cod
stocks on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland have all but disappeared.
The productivity of Canadian workers has grown more slowly than in any other
OECD country over the past decade. One in three pupils drops out of school,
and there is widespread dissatisfaction with the quality of education and
worker training.
To make matters worse, a decade of free-spending federal and provincial
governments has left the public sector burdened by towering budget deficits
and debilitating debt-service payments. The federal government, which keeps
promising fiscal restraint, ended up with its second-biggest deficit ever in
the year to March 1992.
But any effort to restore fiscal discipline must contend with growing public
resistance to an already-heavy tax burden. At the same time, Canadians show
little inclination to sacrifice the social security net and the panoply of
services which make Canadians' lives so comfortable.
Despite this long list of problems, the picture of Canada at the end of 1992
is not entirely gloomy. The very fact that six out of 10 provinces voted No
to the Charlottetown constitutional deal (and a seventh, Ontario, which is
the most powerful province, was almost evenly split), has raised hopes that
the country may not be about to fall apart.
The bruising referendum campaign has left remarkably few scars. Most
Canadians seem simply relieved that the divisive and arcane debate about the
constitution has disappeared for the time being from the evening news.
Most crucially, the No side's victory may not have given the Quebec
separatists as much of a boost as most political commentators predicted.
Recent opinion polls show that support for independence is flagging in the
francophone province. There is no question of Quebeckers feeling betrayed by
English-speaking Canada's rejection of the constitutional deal, as was the
case when Manitoba and Newfoundland scuttled the Meech Lake accord in 1990.
While Quebeckers made the Meech Lake agreement a litmus test of their
acceptance by English Canada, some 56 per cent of them voted against the
latest set of reforms.
The referendum result also does not appear to have done lasting political
damage to Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's crafty premier. Mr Bourassa, often
accused in the past of taking an ambivalent stand on sovereignty, came out
unequivocally during the referendum campaign as a champion of a united
Canada.
Meanwhile, two recent economic developments are forcing Canadian managers
and workers to adjust to the realities of global competition. The first is
the ultra-tight monetary policy followed by the Bank of Canada between 1988
and 1991.
Soaring interest rates and a climbing Canadian dollar pushed the economy
into an unexpectedly severe recession. That has brought inflation down to an
annual rate of slightly over 1 per cent, the lowest among the G7 nations. It
has also squeezed the pips of Canadian business, especially manufacturing.
One example: Dofasco and Stelco, the two biggest steelmakers, have piled up
combined losses of CDollars 1.3bn since 1990.
The second jolt has come from the US-Canada free trade agreement, now
nearing its fourth anniversary. The provisions of the FTA are relatively
modest in terms of lowering trade barriers. They centre on eliminating
customs duties between the two countries by 1998 (most of which were already
low) and guaranteeing US access to Canadian energy resources.
But coinciding with the unexpectedly severe recession, the FTA has given
Canadian industry a shrill wake-up call. One company after another is
freezing or rolling back wages, combining two or more small high-cost plants
into a single efficient one, and searching for ways to reverse the long
slide in worker productivity.
Mr John Crow, governor of the Bank of Canada, summed up the pluses and
minuses of the economic shocks in a recent speech: 'While in the short run,
restructuring can act as a drag on demand, the future benefits of doing
things smarter are enormous.'
With the divisive referendum over and early signs of a business recovery now
starting to appear, the big question is which of the above, radically
different views of Canada's future will turn out to be closer to the mark.
Judging by their recent performance, financial markets lean towards
pessimism. Pressure on the Canadian dollar has been intense since early
September. Despite constant intervention by the Bank of Canada and a steep
rise in short-term interest rates, the currency tumbled from almost 83 US
cents to less than 78 cents in less than three months.
Standard and Poor's recently lowered its Triple-A credit rating on federal
government agencies. Moreover, Ontario's bond rating has been cut twice in
the past two years.
Canadian pension funds and other institutions are putting a growing
proportion of their funds either into foreign markets or into Canadian
companies, such as Seagram and Northern Telecom, with large foreign
operations.
Next year's federal election could prove pivotal in assessing Canada's
long-term prospects. The outcome at this stage is wide open.
The popularity of the Conservative government remains at rock-bottom. It is
paying the price for presiding over the difficult times of the past few
years and for Canadians' intense dislike of Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime
minister.
Mr Mulroney remains confident however, that he can bounce back during 1993
as the economy starts to pick up, and Canadians appreciate the long-term
wisdom of his party's policies.
The Tories have already indicated that, if re-elected, they plan to tackle
some thorny issues, including the generous but costly unemployment insurance
and social security systems. The opposition Liberals are at this stage an
unknown quantity. The party is still in the throes of putting together an
election platform, pitting a group of business-oriented young Turks against
a more interventionist old guard.
In the two years since he was elected Liberal leader, Mr Jean Chretien has
failed to galvanise the party. But a drive to put up some high-powered
candidates for the next election and a flurry of organising at the
grassroots are signs that the Liberals are desperately hungry to return to
office after eight fractious years in the political wilderness.
The Liberals stand to gain more than the Conservatives from the emergence of
the Alberta-based Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois. Both regional groups
have drawn the bulk of their support from former Tory voters.
Mr Preston Manning, the Reform Party's folksy leader, and the more fiery Mr
Lucien Bouchard, who heads the BQ, have both succeeded in attracting strong
support on their home turf.
As opinion polls now stand, these two parties plus the social-democratic New
Democrats could garner enough seats between them to deprive either the
Conservatives or Liberals of a majority government. Political observers talk
darkly of the next election producing an unstable 'Italian-style'
parliament.
It would be a mistake, however, to cast this prediction in stone. As the
referendum result showed, Canadian politics is in a fluid and unpredictable
state. The one certainty is that the picture of Canada's future will be much
clearer by this time next year.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (2): Federalist fights on - Profile of
Robert Bourassa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A BATTLE is over but the war continues', declared Mr Robert Bourassa, 59,
as the Quebec premier conceded defeat in the October 26 referendum.
For Mr Bourassa, the war is the 30-year struggle to define an acceptable
place for French-speaking Quebec within Canada and his own campaign to
contain the forces of separatism.
Mr Bourassa, only 36 when he first became premier in April 1970, has been
publicly derided by Mr Pierre Trudeau, the former federal prime minister,
called a closet separatist by Anglophones, and accused of capitulation by Mr
Jacques Parizeau, the Parti Quebecois opposition leader .
Mr Robert Rae, the Ontario premier, called him a 'master of ambiguity' as
the Quebec leader played for time last July after the other nine provinces
tabled their initial constitutional offer.
Mr Bourassa has at times dithered, bowed to federal pressure, mistaken
timing and strategy, and violated his economic instincts in manoeuvring to
hold the centre ground. But he is an extraordinary survivor and has won the
grudging respect of his political enemies.
Mr Trudeau's use of the War Measures Act to quell the October crisis of 1970
fuelled separatist passions for a generation and led to Mr Bourassa's
humiliation in 1976 by Mr Rene Levesque and the Parti Quebecois.
But Mr Bourassa engineered a remarkable comeback in 1985. He was re-elected
in 1989, confident that he could lead Quebec into signing Canada's 1982
constitution. Those hopes died with the failure of the Meech Lake Accord in
1990.
If anything, Mr Bourassa's defence of federalism has become more passionate
over the past year. He told voters squarely just before l a s t October's
referendum that Quebec could still achieve its economic and cultural aims
best by remaining a part of Canada. There was nothing ambiguous in his
words.
After studying at a Jesuit college in Montreal, Mr Bourassa took a law
degree in 1956 and postgraduate degrees in political economy and
international tax at Oxford and Harvard.
He married into the wealthy Simard family. He worked as a tax specialist in
Ottawa and Quebec City, and then was elected to the national assembly in
1966.
He spurned offers from the surging separatist movement and won the Quebec
Liberal leadership early in 1970. Two months later, he defeated the old
Union Nationale coalition on a platform for economic growth, and won again
in 1973.
After his defeat three years later at the hands of the PQ, Mr Bourassa,
frustrated and bitter, went to study the European Community and later taught
in Europe and the US. But he kept in close touch with Quebec, and by 1983
was back as Quebec Liberal leader. He took his revenge on the PQ in 1985 and
was re-elected with a two-thirds majority in 1989.
Mr Bourassa's passion is the craft of politics. His tenacity is legendary,
but his consensus-type leadership is often bewildering. He dislikes broad
visions and goals, preferring to explain the virtues of investment and
stability.
He freely used the promise of the huge James Bay hydro-electric project to
win at the polls in the 1970s. His 1985 tome 'Power from the North' extolled
the CDollars 15-bn James Bay Phase II as a great export project ensuring
Quebec's prosperity into the next century.
James Bay II has been delayed by New England's long recession and opposition
from the Cree Indians. But Mr Bourassa says he will have the last word,
'because hydro power is most economic and environmentally acceptable'.
Slight in build and tutorial in manner, Mr Bourassa inspires respect but
lacks charisma. He is uneasy on TV, yet friendly and relaxed in
person-to-person meetings. Many Quebecers vote with their wallets and
approve of his cautious approach.
Rumination rather than rhetoric is his style. But Mr Bourassa springs to
life in the national assembly, where he is known as a master of repartee,
able to put down his critics with a contemptuous flip of the hand. He
usually gets the better of Mr Jacques Parizeau, the PQ leader, who was PQ
finance minister from 1976 to 1984 before becoming a popular University of
Montreal economics professor.
For Mr Bourassa, the failure of Meech Lake in 1990 took a heavy toll. The
accord would not only have recognised Quebec as a distinct society but, in
his words, 'would have given us more powers than I'd expected'.
The No vote in this year's referendum has been far less of a setback. Senior
ministers say Mr Bourassa will lead his troops again in the next election,
which is expected to be called in 1994. The one question mark is his health
following a brush with skin cancer two years ago.
He will try to show how Quebec can win more administrative and cultural
'space' from Ottawa, picking his ground for the next constitutional battle
with customary caution.

   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN sugar production is expected to fall to 11.5m tonnes in the 1992-93
season, compared to last year's record 13.4m tonnes, following a 20 per cent
shortfall in the cane crop, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association
(ISMA).
Delayed monsoons in all cane-growing states and the failure of sugar
factories to clear cane bills of nearly Rs5bn (Dollars 176m) forced growers
to cut the area under the crop from last year's 3.85m hectares.
Since the current season has opened with stocks of 4.9m tonnes, total
supplies will remain comfortable. The federal government has already
sanctioned export of 375,000 tonnes of sugar, but has not yet agreed to
create a buffer stock of up to 1m tonnes.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greenland refinery proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 300m zinc refinery might be built in Greenland to process some of
the raw material which at present is shipped from the Canadian Arctic to
Europe for refining.
Substantial quantities of zinc concentrate are produced in the Canadian
Arctic and the supply is expected to increase in 1997 with the start-up of
Metall Mining's Isok Lake project in the Northwest Territories.
Greenland's refinery, which would employ about 350 people and be built near
the capital, Nuuk, would use cheap electricity from a hydroelectric facility
which is nearing completion and will be in full production next year.
Mr Robert Gannicott, president of Platinova A/S, the company behind the
scheme, pointed out that Greenland was only half the distance from the
Canadian Arctic compared to Europe - an important consideration when the
Canadian mines had such short shipping seasons.
Nuuk is on Greenland's south-west coast which is kept ice-free all year by
the Gulf Stream. It offers regular, scheduled shipping services to Europe
and North America and considerable excess capacity in ships leaving
Greenland which could accommodate refined metal, Mr Gannicott said.
Platinova - a junior exploration company, quoted in Toronto with mainly
Canadian and European shareholders - has ordered a pre-feasiblity study of
the refinery project from both Sherritt Gordon and Hatch and Associates.
Mr Gannicott was speaking in London during presentations by the Greenland
government designed to encourage mining and oil companies to do more
exploration.
Mr Lars Emil Johansen, premier of Greenland, a country nearly the size of
the US but with a population of only 55,000, was particularly enthusiastic
about a high-grade gold deposit at Nalunaq in the Kirkespir Valley. This was
discovered recently by Nunaoil A/S, a company jointly owned by Greenland and
Denmark, and Mr Johansen said he hoped the find would support a gold mine
which could be producing from 1996-97.
Microdiamonds have also been discovered in west Greenland and RTZ, the
world's biggest mining company, is at present concentrating its exploration
efforts in the country on diamonds.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM cuts zinc output at
Queensland mine
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Australian miner, has responded to sick world metals
markets with cuts to zinc and lead production at its Mount Isa-Hilton
complex in Queensland.
The managing director of MIM, Mr Norman Fussell, said the company would
reduce output of zinc-lead ore by 15 per cent and the concentrator at the
Hilton mine would switch to processing stockpiled copper converter slag.
'The decision to curtail zinc-lead mining acknowledges the developing
weakness in world markets for those metals, aggravated by exports from
former Soviet bloc countries,' Mr Fussell said.
MIM is the second big Australian mining company to announce production cuts
this month. Earlier, Western Mining Corporation said it planned changes at
both its Kambalda and Leinster nickel operations, but did not spell out the
exact effect on output. Mr Fussell said despite the cuts, zinc and lead
would remain core businesses for MIM. 'Market studies indicate that the
long-term trend of growing demand for zinc and lead will resume after the
recession and a window of opportunity in the market will arise about
1995-96,' he said.
'Hence, the decision of MIM and its joint venturers to develop the McArthur
River mine. We are confident that the use of zinc will increase as an
effective and economical anti-corrosion protector of steel and in other
applications, while the future of lead will be linked to batteries,
including the development of electric vehicles.'
Hamersley Iron, the Australian iron ore miner, will reduce its workforce by
400 at its Pilbara operations in Western Australia because sales have been
lower than expected since June.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINERA Mantos Blancos, the Chilean copper mine controlled by Anglo American
of South Africa, plans to invest Dollars 290m over the next five years to
maintain production at its existing mine and develop a new deposit.
Mantos Blancos needs to double the girth of its open-pit mine near
Antofagasta in the Atacama desert to reach the ore body's remaining
reserves. The expansion, which is expected to cost Dollars 85m, will extend
the life of the mine beyond the year 2010. Output is expected to remain
steady at about 75,000 tonnes a year.
The company will also invest Dollars 56m to switch production from copper
oxides to copper cathodes, which are more environment-friendly.
In addition, Mantos Blancos is developing a second ore body called
Mantoverde, which is expected to enter production in 1994 with an annual
output of nearly 40,000 tonnes. Mr Ricardo Martinez, Mantos Blancos'
spokesman, says the company is still studying its funding options.
Mantos Blancos will have to find Dollars 92m to pay for its share of the
Collahuasi copper project should Royal Dutch/Shell and Falconbridge accept
Minorco and Mantos Blancos as their new partners. Minorco, the
Luxembourg-based associate of Anglo American, has made a Dollars 185m bid
for Chevron's 33 per cent stake.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Government rejects Scottish
milk merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has rejected a proposed takeover by the Scottish Milk
Marketing Board of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's milk business in
Scotland, following a recommendation by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission yesterday.
The MMC ruled that the combined entity would be more efficient but might
abuse its large share of the Scottish market by giving preferential
treatment to its own commercial operations and raising prices for both raw
and processed milk. These dangers would arise after 1994, when the Scottish
MMB is likely to become a voluntary producers' co-operative.
The Scottish MMB, one of three milk marketing boards in Scotland, purchases
milk from farmers and sells it for processing. It produces its own milk for
retail sale under the Scottish Pride and Scottish Farm labels.
The MMC's decision could have a bearing on the future of the Milk Marketing
Board in England and Wales, which the government also wants to see becoming
a voluntary co-operative. The scheme, for which legislation is before
parliament, is opposed by private dairy companies.
The MMC's decision will be seen as a victory for independent Scottish
processors, who felt that the Scottish MMB was increasing its vertical
integration in the Scottish market in advance of the shake-up in 1994, and
expanding its liquid milk processing.
Yesterday the CWS said the decision had very little to do with the sale of
its milk operation in Scotland and 'much to do with the deregulation of the
milk marketing scheme'. It said it was absurd that it had taken the Scottish
Office and the regulatory authorities 18 months to come to this conclusion.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean gives Gummer mixed
reaction to banana proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Gummer, Britain's farm minister, made a hurried trip through the
Caribbean at the weekend to try to mollify growing regional concern over new
UK proposals for the marketing of bananas when the single European market is
created next month.
In his wake, the reaction in the region was mixed, with expressions of hope
that the new proposals would guarantee the market access which the Caribbean
producers want, following indications that Britain will suggest the EC use
tariffs instead of quotas for banana imports.
Mr Gummer's whirlwind visit, in which he met representatives of the Belize,
Jamaica and Windward Islands banana industries in separate meetings over two
days, was intended to explain the proposals which Britain, as the EC
president, hopes to present to next week's meeting of the community's farm
ministers.
A statement issued by the St Lucian government said the Windward islands
were 'satisfied' with the new British proposals which 'addressed the concern
of the Windward islands and other Caribbean producers and meet Europe's
obligations enshrined in the Lome Convention, while not offending the terms
of the GATT negotiations now approaching completion'.
The meeting in St Lucia was attended by Mr John Compton, the prime minister
of that island, and Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica, and
ministers from Grenada and St Vincent. The statement said the Windward
islands were 'satisfied that the Gummer proposals represent a serious
attempt to break the deadlock and provide a satisfactory solution to the
banana problem.'
Mr Marshall Hall, chairman of the Banana Export Company of Jamaica, said he
would be surprised 'if there is a change of direction on the banana policy
at this late stage'. He said that if this were so, Caribbean producers would
insist that the provisions of the Lome Convention be respected.
The convention is a trade treaty between the EC and members of the African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group. The banana protocol of the convention
says the EC will undertake to ensure that ACP banana exporters are left in
no worse a position by changes in the market for the fruit.
'We have said to the British that it is clear nothing can be agreed by
January 1, and that we therefore need a marketing regime which must be
similar to the one in place now,' said Mr Hall.
However, some industry representatives in the region say the 'tariffication'
of the market being proposed by Britain goes against earlier commitments
that markets will be protected, and that this latest change will satisfy
only the Latin American producers who have been arguing against the use of
EC import quotas.
The minister told the House of Commons last week that the UK and France had
planned 'intermediate measures' to protect the exports of traditional
suppliers; and that the UK was not tied to any one method but was instead
'tied to an end'.
The European Commission had earlier suggested the use of quotas to guarantee
the market of the traditional suppliers of the ACP group. But Mr Gummer is
reported to have told the Caribbean political leaders and banana industry
officials in the meetings over the weekend that no agreement on the
Commission's proposal was possible because quotas were not acceptable to
several EC members, including Germany, Belgium and Denmark.
Mr Gummer also told the Caribbean producers that in light of an expected
agreement between the US and the EC on trade in farm products, a GATT waiver
to allow banana quotas would be difficult, and that a 'GATT-compatible'
agreement on bananas was needed.
There will be no solution to the problem by the January 1 deadline, the
minister said, but the UK had devised a plan which would allow Caribbean and
other ACP banana producers some protection after the Europe single market
was effected.
There is reluctance in the region to give details of what Mr Gummer proposed
in the meetings. The British minister is reported to have explained to the
Caribbean leaders and the banana industry representatives that the new
proposals which would see tariffs on ACP fruit, with country-specific
tonnages being allocated for fruit from ACP producers and with agreed
quantities to be imported from other sources, mainly from Latin American
countries.
Caribbean representatives in the several meetings told Mr Gummer that they
preferred the original European Commission proposals for the application of
quotas, but that if this were not possible, then they would be comfortable
only if the tonnages for Latin American fruit were low, and the tariffs to
be applied were high.

London COCOA took a sudden dive on what traders said was fund liquidation.
After ending the morning with moderate losses, the market plunged after the
New York March contract breached first Dollars 1,000 and then Dollars 980 in
early trading. 'A significant trend line was broken in London, precipitating
the sell off here,' said a commission house trader. 'The fall was
exaggerated by sell stops because there is no fundamental news out today.' A
London trader said that people had got 'rather complacent really. We're
going to need something quite new to shake up some buying.' New York arabica
COFFEE prices were lower at midsession, but holding support after a rise in
warehouse stocks. London's March robusta contract fell back below Dollars
1,000 a tonne. 'Both London and New York are looking to consolidate but
London is running into more origin selling,' one dealer said. Three-month
NICKEL advanced further on the LME, but profit taking and chart selling were
evident above Dollars 6,000.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries strengthen on unexpected fall
in store sales
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER an initial period of consolidation, US Treasury prices firmed slightly
across the board yesterday in the wake of an unexpected decline in store
sales.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 102
9/32 , to yield 7.428 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was  1/8 firmer at 100 1/8 , to carry a yield of 4.541 per cent.
Trading was subdued during the morning, although there was some sporadic
profit-taking. Prices have risen substantially in the last few days amid
hopes that economic growth would be sufficient to dissuade president-elect
Bill Clinton from over-stimulating the economy with an aggressive package of
fiscal stimuli.
By yesterday, analysts felt that these hopes had been properly priced into
the market, which has also already discounted this week's most important
economic figures - the data on November producer and consumer prices, and
retail sales.
Prices picked up in the afternoon, however, following the release of the
Johnson Redbook report, which showed a 2.2 per cent decline in US department
and chain store sales during the first week of December.
UK government bonds closed higher, with long-dated issues benefiting from
the current interest in lengthening trades.
In the cash market, the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 108 21/32 to
108 15/16 to yield 8.38 per cent as dealers noted some interest in switching
into longer-dated issues. At the short end of the market, the 10 per cent
gilt due 1994 gained  1/16 of a point to end at 104 13/32 , yielding 6.87
per cent.
The recent spate of more optimistic economic data has dashed hopes of a cut
in the base rate, encouraging interest in lengthening trades, dealers said.
However, volume remained thin, with only about 16,000 futures contracts
traded.
MEDIUM and long-dated German government bonds closed higher yesterday,
although dealers said that the short end of the market remained nervous
about a possible rise in interest rates at the Bundesbank's repo operations.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 91.44 and traded up to a high of
91.67 before closing at 91.58.
However, volume in the market was relatively low at around 28,500 contracts.
The market will be watching today's allocation of 14-day securities
repurchase agreements to see whether there is an increase in the minimum
rate at which funds are allocated.
Dealers said there was some nervousness that the minimum rate may rise,
especially as overnight money has edged up to 8.95-9.05 per cent, from
8.85-8.95 per cent on Monday.
The main focus for the market this week is tomorrow's meeting of the
Bundesbank council, at which the central bank is expected to announce its
money supply growth target for 1993. Some economists predict that the
Bundesbank will set a slightly higher money supply growth target for 1993 at
the meeting, raising it from its present target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent to
4.0-6.0 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds ended slightly weaker as money market interest
rates edged up.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.585 per cent, moving to a high
of 4.575 per cent before ending at 4.595 per cent. The March bond future
contract fell from 107.90 to close at 107.76. The overnight call rate traded
at 3 29/32 per cent, compared with 3 27/32 per cent on Monday.
Dealers said that the bond market was waiting for Friday's tankan report,
the Bank of Japan's quarterly economic review, in the hope that the central
bank would cut the official discount rate.
However, the announcement yesterday by several of the city banks that they
will cut their short-term prime rates by a quarter of a point to 4.5 per
cent, may reduce the chance of such a discount rate cut, dealers said.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: European alliance of four
banks disbanded

<TEXT>
EUROPARTNERS, the alliance formed more than 20 years ago between four
leading European banks, has agreed to disband, marking a further erosion of
the once-popular banking partnerships of the 1970s.
At a meeting in Rome this week, the heads of Banca di Roma, Commerzbank,
Credit Lyonnais and Banco Central Hispano-Americano decided their loose
union - whose ambitions once included operating joint branches in third
countries - no longer fitted in with the liberalised European market.
Almost the only remaining tangible sign of the alliance, one of a number of
loose partnerships between European banks, is the cross-equity stakes
between Commerzbank and Banco Hispano-Americano.
Attempts between the partners, notably Commerzbank, to develop closer ties
foundered on a mixture of growing competition between the members and
confused national banking policies.
Matters were not helped by the fact that two of the Europartners were from
the private sector and the other pair state-owned.
However, it was the steady integration of European finance which hammered
the final nail into Europartners' coffin. Though originally formed on the
understanding that no member would do business independently on another's
territory, that principle was eventually watered down to cover only retail
banking.
In the end, even that proved too much in an increasingly competitive
European banking market as national borders crumbled and Credit Lyonnais, in
particular, pursued an aggressive policy to build up an acquisition-based
retail banking presence in Italy and now Germany.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's downgrades not a
major obstacle, say UK insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE downgrading of financial strength and debt ratings of Sun Alliance and
Eagle Star by Moody's Investors Service, the US agency, is being seen as
something of an irritation by the UK insurance industry.
The reaction from the companies and some of their competitors was that the
move, which largely reflects concern about exposure to UK domestic mortgage
indemnity risk, is not a major obstacle to tapping capital markets.
'The economic environment seems to be improving,' said Mr Peter Fiddimore,
responsible for corporate treasury at Sun Alliance. Being put on review in
the first place pushed up commercial paper borrowing costs by up to 25 basis
points, he said.
Moody's acknowledges that if there are no further adverse developments in
the UK housing sector or large claims caused by terrorism or storms, the
fortunes of UK composite insurers could be at a turning point as premium
rates harden and interest rates fall.
Moody's downgraded to A2 from A1 the senior debt ratings of the Sun Alliance
group holding company and the financial strength rating of the main
operating company to Aa3 from Aa2, while Eagle Star Insurance's financial
strength rating was lowed to A2 from A1. Royal Insurance's financial
strength rating was confirmed at A3. Between them, the three groups have an
estimated 60 to 65 per cent of the domestic mortgage indemnity market.
'The fact that the downward ratings changes are so small compared with the
mortgage indemnity crisis indicates there are compensating comforts from
other factors,' said Mr David Anthony, a senior analyst at Moody's.
'Everybody is at least guardedly optimistic that 1993 could be a good year
for the UK composite sector,' he added.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Firm demand for Dollars 2bn Citicorp
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP'S Dollars 2bn global offering of credit card backed securities,
launched yesterday for pricing today, met firm demand from investors in both
the US and Europe.
The offering, consisting of Dollars 1bn of two-year notes and Dollars 1bn of
five-year notes, is backed by Citicorp credit card receivables.
The indicated pricing is 17 to 20 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate for the two-year notes, arranged by Citibank, and 30 to 32
basis points over Libor for the five-year notes, arranged by Salomon
Brothers.
The notes will be priced tomorrow at par or slightly below.
Both two-year and five-year notes were issued in conjunction with junior
tranches of notes arranged by JP Morgan.
Dealers said that demand for the two-year notes had been particularly strong
in the US, where the large money funds provide a ready investor base.
'Most of the US funds are able to go out as far as two years, and are
prepared to do so when the yield is high enough,' said one trader, who added
that the same sort of investor base did not exist in Europe.
Citicorp has already launched an issue of floating-rate notes backed by
credit card receivables, earlier this year.
The deal completes Citicorp's Dollars 5bn securitisation programme this
year. The company expects to have a Dollars 5-6bn borrowing programme again
next year, an official said.
Exportfinans, the Norwegian export lending agency, plans to use a novel
structure which will allow it to add to its Tier 1 capital.
The agency has filed a proposed public offering with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the US for a Dollars 100m issue of preferred capital
securities.
The structure, which has not been used before, was developed by Goldman
Sachs.
The concept is similar to preferred stock, expect that legally the
securities are not shares. Nevertheless, the Norwegian regulatory
authorities have approved the securities as Tier 1 capital.
The securities will be denominated in dollars and will entitle holders to
receive fixed-rate quarterly interest payments, subject to certain
conditions.
The subordinated debt will be undated, but Exportfinans will have the right
to redeem the securities at par after 10 years, subject to regulatory
approval.
Other Norwegian borrowers might be able to use the same type of instrument,
but borrowers from other countries would need to convince their regulators
to approve the structure as Tier 1 capital.

<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state bank that controls MGM, the Hollywood
studio, has filed a lawsuit seeking Dollars 500m from Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the
former MGM owner, and several of his business associates.
MGM has filed a separate suit against Mr Kerkorian and his colleagues,
seeking Dollars 750m of damages.
The legal actions, filed in Los Angeles, allege that Mr Kerkorian engaged in
a scheme to deceive Credit Lyonnais in order to facilitate his November 1990
sale of MGM to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier
who in turn was forced out of the studio last year by Credit Lyonnais.
Mr Kerkorian is accused in the Credit Lyonnais lawsuit of having conspired
with Mr Parretti to conceal the fact that MGM had insufficient cash flow to
finance its opera-tions following the acquisi-tion.
He and his colleagues are accused in the separate MGM action of having
breached their fiduciary duties in relation to the cash flow analyses
presented in 1990.
Lawyers for Mr Kerkorian termed the accusations 'completely unfounded'.
Capital Cities/ABC, the US broadcasting and publishing group, was
financially capable of and interested in making a significant acquisition
costing as much as Dollars 8bn, Reuter reports from New York.
Mr Daniel Burke, chief executive officer, told an investors conference that
the company was constantly looking for such a deal, but gave no indication
whether a move was imminent.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Deere returns to black but
forecasts loss in next quarter

<TEXT>
DEERE, the US farm equipment group, yesterday returned to profit in the
fourth quarter and the year to end-October 1992, but forecast a loss for the
first quarter of the coming financial year. The company cited weakness in
the worldwide sales.
Fourth-quarter earnings were Dollars 4.2m, or 5 cents per share, compared
with last year's loss of Dollars 81.5m, or Dollars 1.07 per share. Worldwide
sales were virtually static at Dollars 1.9bn.
For the year, Deere reported a profit of Dollars 37.4m, or 49 cents per
share, on sales of Dollars 6.96bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 20.2m, or
27 cents, on sales of Dollars 7.05bn in 1991.
Fourth-quarter results were boosted by a Dollars 20.7m reduction in
inventories. In the same 1991 quarter, the inventory benefit to results was
Dollars 65.0m.
Deere's credit, insurance, and health care subsidiaries posted strong sales
and profit gains in the quarter. However, its core business of agricultural,
industrial and lawn and grounds care equipment suffered.
The company's worldwide equipment operations posted a net loss of Dollars
33.7m in the quarter, compared with a deficit of Dollars 103.2m a year ago,
which included a Dollars 120m restructuring charge.
With North American grain production expected to level off in 1993, and farm
income projected to be flat, Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said he expected
North American retail sales of farm equip-ment to remain flat.
European agricultural equipment was expected to continue to decline, he
said, because revisions to government agricultural policies would probably
lead to reduced farm incomes and crop production in 1993.
'First-quarter 1993 production tonnage is expected to be approximately the
same as in last year's depressed initial quarter,' Mr Becherer said.
He added that several factories would be closed for one or two week periods,
in addition to normal holiday shutdowns.
As a result, he said, Deere expected to incur a loss in the usually weak
first quarter. Last year the company recorded a first-quarter loss of
Dollars 19.9m.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Fatigued carrier files details
of its new flight plan - After months of negotiations TWA hopes to be taken
off the critical list shortly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARL ICAHN, one-time corporate raider and owner of Trans World Airlines, has
said he does not want to be remembered as the man who killed the carrier
which Howard Hughes built up.
On Monday, as he negotiated the final elements of a restructuring deal with
TWA's unions, creditors, and the US federal pensions agency, the New
York-born financier went some way to avoiding that epitaph.
The proposed reorganisation, which includes a short-term loan to the
airline, should take TWA off the critical list this winter.
Whether it moves the carrier - in bankruptcy since January and loss-making -
out of the casualty ward in the longer term, is more debatable.
TWA's problems pre-date Mr Icahn's involvement and throughout the early
1980s losses from its troubled domestic routes outweighed profitable
international operations.
Indeed, by 1986, when Mr Icahn entered upon the scene in share-punting style
and acquired a 47 per cent block of shares, TWA was already under takeover
threat.
At this point, however, the unions decided Mr Icahn was the best alternative
on offer, and offered him large wage concessions.
This encouraged the financier to negotiate his way to management control.
Mr Icahn's ownership was then cemented in 1988, when TWA was taken private
via a leveraged buy-out financed by Drexel Burnham Lambert, the now-defunct
investment bank.
From Mr Icahn's perspective, it was a masterly deal, giving him 90 per cent
of the airline's shares and Dollars 469m in cash - more than he paid for his
original equity stake. Unfortunately, the transaction also added hundreds of
millions of dollars of debt to TWA's balance sheet.
These heavy borrowings then compounded the difficult operating conditions in
the airline industry during the 1990s. TWA suffered an operating loss of
Dollars 162.3m in 1990 and another Dollars 353.5m deficit in 1991. Interest
charges consumed another Dollars 302.8m and Dollars 287m in the same years.
For a while, the carrier struggled on, thanks to asset sales. Most notably,
it sold off its London Heathrow routes to American Airlines in 1991. Asset
sale proceeds of Dollars 681.7m that year allowed it to post a small net
profit of Dollars 48.3m. But in early 1992, TWA finally filed for protection
from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code.
Since the bankruptcy filing, pragmatism has been the order of the day, with
all parties realising that the carrier could not survive with its existing
balance sheet.
Given TWA's ageing fleet and the current glut of aircraft internationally,
there was a strong incentive to restructure the carrier and hope the airline
industry revives, rather than simply liquidate remaining assets. Creditors,
unions and management have spent the past year negotiating with this aim in
mind.
The complicating factor has been TWA's pension plans. In the US, unlike the
UK, there is a federal agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
which guarantees payment of basic pension benefits.
The PBGC claims the TWA pension plans are underfunded by more than Dollars
1bn and it is not anxious to pick up the bill. Its bargaining counter has
been the notion of 'joint and several liability' - that is, that Mr Icahn's
level of ownership in TWA renders his other (more prosperous) private
business interests responsible for minimum funding contributions to the
plans.
This extremely important legal nuance seems to have surprised even the wily
Mr Icahn.
So who gets and who gives what in the reorganisation deal?
TWA's unions, thoroughly disenchanted with the Icahn management, have
offered a 15 per cent wage benefit concession package, estimated to be worth
Dollars 660m in savings over a three-year period. In return, they get a 45
per cent equity stake in the reorganised airline when it comes out of
bankruptcy.
Unsecured creditors abandon around Dollars 1bn of claims against the
carrier, but get the remaining 55 per cent of the shares. They also receive
no cash payments on any reorganisation securities for a three-year period.
Mr Icahn loses his equity interest in TWA, any management role, and abandons
all claims against the airline, thus cancelling another Dollars 175m of
unsecured claims. He, or one of the companies under his control, provides a
Dollars 185.3m, two-year loan to the airline, earning 1 per cent over prime
rate. This gives the airline the necessary funds to get through the dull
winter travel period. Mr Icahn also guarantees a minimum sales price of
Dollars 14.7m for Midcoast Aviation, a TWA subsidiary.
On the pension front, Mr Icahn will act as 'sponsor' to the frozen plans and
make annual payments - around Dollars 20m annually for four years - which
allow the plans to meet minimum ongoing funding requirements. Mr Icahn can
either find these sums from personal contributions or through better than
anticipated returns on the pension investments.
Finally, the PBGC gets some funding of the plans made up via a Dollars 300m
note issued by TWA, to be secured on its international routes/Kansas City
maintainence base.
This note bears interest at 11 per cent over a 15-year period. Mr Icahn then
chips in on top.
Does this mean that a viable airline has been created?
It is at least preferable to the carrier that went into bankruptcy.
First, the operational results should benefit from the labour concessions
and, perhaps, the change in top-level management. The former took effect in
October and were accompanied by a general downsizing at the airline.
TWA, for example, streamlined its domestic route structure, cutting out
services to about eight cities; it eliminated a handful of international
destinations; it reduced the number of operational aircraft; it pruned
several thousand jobs and so on.
Second, with lenders set to forgive about two-thirds of the Dollars 1.5bn
debt burden, the reorganised airline will carry a much-reduced financial
burden.
TWA will also retain a fair number of international routes, notably to
continental European destinations, plus its terminal and hub operation at
New York's JFK airport. Some analysts still see the international routes as
the more attractive side of the business, despite TWA's lack of domestic
feed.
On the minus side, the fleet is old, the airline's reputation with the
flying public sullied and the viability of the domestic operation has yet to
be proved.
'There's a big challenge out there,' says Avmark, the aviation consultancy -
a fair summary of the general ambivalence towards the carrier's long-term
prospects.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Increase in sales helps Heinz
advance to Dollars 154m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
H. J. HEINZ, the food group based in Pittsburgh, yesterday reported
after-tax profits of Dollars 154.2m in the three months to October 28 - the
second quarter of its financial year.
The result compares with a Dollars 122.8m in the same period of 1991, and
was scored on sales which rose from Dollars 1.59bn to Dollars 1.74bn.
Operating profits improved by 15 per cent, year-on-year, to Dollars 261.6m.
At the earnings per share level, the result translates into 60 cents,
compared with 46 cents a year ago.
Heinz said that the gains in sales and operating profits were due largely to
an overall volume improvement of 7 per cent and to favourable exchange rate
movements.
It added that the volume advance had come in all US affiliates and in
certain overseas markets, including the UK. 'Volume gains were noted in
Weight Watchers brand food products, pet food, tuna, baby food, beans and
ketchup,' it said.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, claimed that some of the moves taken by the
company in 1991, which included restructuring action designed to cut costs,
lay behind the improvement.
'A record number of new products will be introduced this fiscal year with
full marketing support,' he added.
The company has been the target of criticism recently, with commentators
questioning whether it can match its impressive performance during the
1980s, particularly since it is operating in some of the most competitive
areas of the food industry.
Yesterday, however, the second-quarter figures helped the shares up Dollars
 3/4 to Dollars 43 7/8 .
After-tax profits for the first six months now stand at Dollars 298m,
against Dollars 377.2m a year ago - although the 1991 figure included
Dollars 221.4m from the sale of a subsidiary.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Outcry over exchange expansion -
CBOT plans to build a Dollars 150m trading facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER trading may be where the future lies for financial markets in
general, but North America's largest futures exchanges are all planning to
expand their trading floors in 1993, sticking loyally to the open outcry
system.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, jumped on
the expansion bandwagon this month with a proposal to build a Dollars 150m
trading facility immediately south of the exchange on LaSalle Street. The
membership will vote on the plan on December 17.
The proposal comes as US financial futures products are under increasingly
competitive assault by over-the-counter traders and overseas exchanges.
Smaller CBOT member firms which are struggling financially have not received
the proposal happily. The plan, to be financed in part by a four-year
increase in trading fees, coincides with a controversial exchange-sponsored
study that suggests declining profitability among brokers.
While exchange officials refuse to comment on the study, a Chicago newspaper
last week reported that the analysis found that average annual income for
the CBOT's soya bean futures traders dropped an inflation-adjusted 40 per
cent between 1988 and 1991, and that even traders in the exchange's frenzied
Treasury bond pit have seen income decline in recent years.
In a letter to members Mr Thomas Donovan, CBOT president, said the data in
the newspaper report was preliminary and misleading. However, he failed to
quell complaints by independent traders and small brokerage houses that they
are losing money as business concentrates in fewer pits and the large
investment houses.
The CBOT building project is aimed at relieving overcrowding on the
exchange's financial futures trading floor. Despite the complaints, exchange
volume has risen every year, thanks to the US Treasury bond and note pits,
where trading space has long been inadequate. Bond and note brokers work in
a stuffy, poorly-lit 19,000 sq ft space first designed for cash grain
trading.
A proposal to move the financial futures trade across the hall and into the
exchange's 35,000 sq ft state-of-the art trading floor was blocked by grain
and soyabean futures traders, who have used the facility since it opened in
1984. In practice, agricultural members control the CBOT's politics,
although they generate little more than 20 per cent of exchange volume.
Those same interests may veto the new building plan, although officials say
it is essential to the CBOT's growth. While the CBOT and the rival Chicago
Mercantile Exchange have invested heavily in Globex, the electronic
after-hours trading system, Globex is not expected to replace immediately
the trading floor. Launched in the summer, Globex has been troubled by
software bugs and rarely records daily volumes above 3,000 contracts.
'All three exchanges (the CBOT, the CME and the New York Mercantile
Exchange) have capacity problems, and one has to be prepared to expand the
factory,' says Mr Richard Sandor, one of the architects of the first CBOT
financial futures contract, and now an executive managing director at Kidder
Peabody in New York.
While electronic trading has become popular, particularly in Europe, Mr
Sandor says: 'These are long-tailed cycles . . . these things can co-exist
side-by-side.'
In the first 11 months of 1992, the CBOT traded 140.5m contracts, up 8.5 per
cent over the same period in 1991. Of that total, 105.5m were financial
futures and options, mostly Treasury bonds and notes.
The CME increased volume by 25.3 per cent over the same period with more
than 68m contracts traded in the overcrowded Eurodollar futures and options
pits. The Eurodollar derivatives are growing in excess of 64 per cent per
year, thanks mostly to interest rate swap business.
The CME plans to move its Eurodollar and foreign currency futures and
options pits to a new trading floor directly above its current floor next
summer. It is engaged in a Dollars 26.6m outfitting which will equal the
size of the CME's existing 35,000 sq ft floor.
The CME has out-grown its trading space four times in the past 20 years. Mr
Jack Sander, CME chairman, said space on the existing floor freed by the
move will be devoted to foreign and domestic stock index futures.
The CME expansion is being financed from existing resources and will not
require increased clearing fees.
New York's Nymex has also taken a conservative approach to overcrowding,
opting to lease, rather than build. Last month the exchange, which has a
growing complex of energy futures products, announced it would move from its
shared floor in the World Trade Center to a building in lower Manhattan.
Plans for the space, which the Nymex will lease for 15 years, include a
25,000sq ft trading floor.
Nymex received a variety of tax breaks and incentives to take the site and
does not expect to have to raise clearing fees to finance the move.
New York's three smaller commodity exchanges, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange and the Commodity Exchange, hope to
start on a new building in lower Manhattan in mid-1993.
The exchanges are still negotiating financing on the Dollars 150m project,
and expect to remain in the World Trade Center location they share with
Nymex throughout next year.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Saudi royal steps in on Circle K
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SAUDI prince yesterday emerged as the potential backer of one of three
reorganisation schemes being put forward for Circle K, the bankrupt US
convenience store chain.
Commonwealth Oil Refining Company, an oil company based in Arlington, Texas,
said that it had received a 'firm written commitment' from Prince Turki bi
Fahd bin Jalawi Al Saud to provide Dollars 360m of equity capital towards
the financing of a Commonwealth Oil-sponsored plan of reorganisation for
Circle K.
Commonwealth, which materialised as a potential investor in Circle K in
October, added that it would now file with the bankruptcy court an amended
proposed plan of reorganisation for the company.
It claims that this will offer Circle K's senior creditors around Dollars
350m in cash - slightly more than the company's own reorganisation proposal.
Under the amended plan, unsecured creditors would also receive cash, while
Commonwealth would emerge as the biggest single shareholder in the
reorganised company.
The situation at the bankrupt retailer - which is based in Phoenix, Arizona,
and continues to operate over 3,000 stores - has been mired in controversy
for some months.
The company has put forward its own reorganisation plan, which essentially
involves selling Circle K for Dollars 399.5m to CK Acquisitions Corp, an
international investor group lead by Bahrain-based Investcorp.
Investcorp already holds various retail-related interests in the US,
including Saks Fifth Avenue, the department store chain.
Circle K bondholders oppose the deal, however, and have put forward their
own reorganisation scheme.
Yesterday, Mr Duncan Darrow, a lawyer with Anderson Kill Olick &amp; Oshinsky,
which is acting for the bondholders committee, claimed the bondholders were
trying to find a way to join in a fully agreed deal and obtain 'a reasonable
recovery'.
He suggested that the Commonwealth plan provided bondholders with a
'meaningful recovery', although a spokesman for the law firm added that the
bondholders were still pushing their own reorganisation scheme.
There was no immediate response from Circle K to the apparent changes in the
Commonwealth plan.

project

<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's two mining giants - Anglo American and Gencor - have
confirmed that they will be proceeding with their R3.5bn (Dollars 1.1bn)
joint venture stainless steel project.
It is the fourth large capital development to be announced by the two groups
in the past two months. Construction of the plant, about 120km east of
Johannesburg, will start in January.
The project - an expansion of the existing Columbus plant - is a joint
venture between Anglo and Gencor and the Industrial Development Corporation
(IDC) who will be equal one-third equity partners. It exemplifies the trend
underway in South Africa to add value to mineral resources rather than
export them in raw form.
Columbus has ready access to ferrochrome and nickel, the main ingredients of
stainless steel. Not only does South Africa have most of the world's chrome
ore reserves, but Columbus will also be able to source all its nickel
requirements locally.
The expansion will quadruple South Africa's stainless steel capacity to
500,000 tonnes a year from the existing 125,000 tonnes.
It will turn South Africa into the world's sixth-largest stainless steel
producing country.
Two factors made the project viable: the acquisition, in September 1991, by
an Anglo-Gencor consortium of Middelburg Steel and Alloys (MS&amp;A) plus tax
allowances.
Mr Gilbertson declined to elaborate on the returns the project was expected
to make.
The project should increase value-added to raw materials by 40 to 50 per
cent.
It is expected to earn R16bn in foreign exchange in 1993 terms in the first
25 years of its life.
Present world demand for stainless steel is about 11m tonnes a year, with
demand presently increasing at about 3.5 to 5 per cent a year.

TIMES Mirror, the US publishing group, expects 1993 to be a difficult year.
The group also expects to take special charges against fourth-quarter 1992
earnings, although it declined to detail them, Reuter reports from New York.
The company said it expected 1993 first-quarter earnings to be affected by
several 'serious impediments'. Times Mirror earned 26 cents per share in the
1991 first quarter, before a non-recurring gain.
The fourth-quarter charges will include those for restructuring publisher
Matthew Bender and adoption of an accounting change on post-retirement
benefits.

collapses

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARIS'S first experiment with privately-run public transport flopped
yesterday when the backers of Orlyval, a driverless automatic train,
admitted they would have to write off FFr1bn (Dollars 187m) of debts and
hand control of the lossmaking line to the state.
The line, built for FFr1.75bn by Matra, the transport-to-defence electronics
group, is to go into voluntary liquidation and be taken over and run by
RATP, the state-owned Parisian public transport board, because it has
attracted far fewer passengers than budgeted.
Orlyval, opened in October 1991, links Orly airport with the nearest
suburban rail line and is an important showcase for Matra's vehicule
automatique leger. It is Matra's second Val in France, after the
publicly-run automatic metro in the northern city of Lille.
The private group which owns Orlyval is 34.7 per cent held by a consortium
of banks, headed by Banque Indosuez, with 26.7 per cent held by Air Inter,
the domestic airline, 18 per cent by Lyonnais des Eaux-Dumez, the
construction and water distribution group, 17.3 per cent by Matra and 3.3
per cent by the RATP.
An Indosuez spokesman said yesterday that the group owed FFr1.58bn to its
backers, of which the banks and the other shareholders had agreed to abandon
two-thirds. Orlyval will be able to pay back FFr250m before liquidation,
while the RATP is prepared to pay back another FFr330m from future operating
profits, said the Indosuez official.
Orlyval carries 5,000 passengers per day, or 1.5m annually, well under half
the 4m passengers per year its backers were expecting. As a result, it made
a FF58.1m loss in its first year. It cut fares and launched a promotional
campaign last summer to try to attract more passengers.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Rodamco loss widens to Fl 405m

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RODAMCO, the largest property investment company in the Netherlands,
yesterday blamed the decline of sterling and a fall in property valuations
for a widening of its net total investment losses to Fl 405m (Dollars 230m)
in the first nine months of 1992-93. This compared with a loss of Fl 66m
over the same period of 1991-92.
The company, which is part of the Robeco investment group, said that direct
investment results - which comprise rental, interest and dividend income and
which help determine the dividend to shareholders - rose to Fl 319m in
March-November 1992 from Fl 300m a year earlier.
However, indirect results - which include currency movements and property
valuations - fell into a loss of Fl 737m from a loss of Fl 386m a year ago.
In local currencies, property values were written down by Fl 433m, slightly
less than the Fl 441m write-down seen in the same period of 1991-92. At the
beginning of the current fiscal year, Rodamco had property assets of Fl
7.7bn.
In Britain, which accounts for roughly one-fifth of Rodamco's property
portfolio, the value of properties was lowered by 16.6 per cent, nearly
double the 8.6 per cent rate for continental Europe and well ahead of the
3.5 per cent for North America.
Sterling's depreciation was the main reason why currency movements made a
negative Fl 300m contribution to indirect investment results. A year
earlier, currency movements had added Fl 49m.
The company said that the 1992-93 dividend was likely to be unchanged.

FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Alitalia poised to acquire stake
in Hungarian airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARIAN government officials yesterday indicated that Alitalia, the
Italian state airline, was poised to acquire a minority stake in Malev, the
Hungarian carrier, against stiff competition from Lufthansa of Germany.
A formal announcement of the sale is expected next week, although some
observers have not excluded the possibility of a last-minute push by
Lufthansa, which has been keen to extend its growing east European coverage
by forging a partnership with Hungary's flag-carrier.
Officials in Budapest said the winning bidder would take a shareholding of
about 35 per cent in Malev, at a cost of over Dollars 60m.
An Air France-led consortium earlier this year paid Dollars 60m for 40 per
cent in CSA, the Czechoslovak carrier.
Negotiations on the Malev deal have been taking place for some time.
However, the airline indicated a solution was imminent by announcing last
week that it would hold a shareholders' meeting on January 8 to approve a
capital increase linked to its privatisation.
If Alitalia emerges as the successful bidder it will have overcome
opposition from influential officials within the Budapest government, who
felt that a link-up with Lufthansa would have provided a more secure future
for the Hungarian carrier.
Malev, which is seen as one of the better-managed and more efficient of the
former Communist-dominated east European airlines, has been seeking a
European partner to help it compete on new international services using
western aircraft.
In May, British Airways, Lufthansa and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines were
identified by executives closely following the Malev privatisation as the
leading contenders.
British Airways subsequently said it was not seriously interested; and KLM
later announced it was dropping out of the bidding.
The success of Alitalia's bid appears to have been based on superior
financial terms to Lufthansa's proposal. Alitalia, although appreciably
smaller than the German airline, has been striving to improve quality and
profitability standards in recent years.
The Malev deal would mark its first equity stake in a foreign airline and
would represent a departure from the cautious approach of Italian business
towards buying into foreign companies.
Malev's pre-tax profits rose 57 per cent in 1991 to Ft2.09bn (Dollars 25m),
in spite of the worldwide recession in the airline business and the fall in
passengers as a consequence of the Gulf war.
However, the company needs an infusion of capital to finance the replacement
of more of its largely Soviet-made fleet of aircraft with more modern and
fuel-efficient western substitutes.

Spanish property company

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BIDDING war for El Encinar de los Reyes, a medium-sized Spanish property
group, ended yesterday when two rival bidders, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the
large commercial bank, and the Olazabal family which controls El Encinar,
agreed to join forces to take over the company.
The groups said they planned to make a bid, worth Pta170bn (Dollars 1.5bn),
offering Pta2,900 a share, for the whole of El Encinar. Mr Jaime Olazabal
would become president and Mr Santiago Bergareche, president of Metrovacesa,
BBV's property arm, would become deputy president.
The fight for control of El Encinar, which owns a former US Air Force
housing base outside Madrid, had split Madrid's investment community since
October, when the Olazabals, who control 35 per cent of the target company,
launched a formal takeover offer, at Pta2,500 a share, for a further 14 per
cent. That would have given them control as El Encinar owns 3 per cent of
its own equity as treasury stock.
The BBV, which had built up a stake of 24.9 per cent of El Encinar earlier
this year, countered with an unusual promise that it would improve on the
Olazabal offer - if shareholders ignored it - after it had expired. It did
not say how much it would pay, nor how much it would offer.
The Olazabals increased their offer to Pta2,750 and complained to the courts
that the BBV was flouting takeover rules by not bidding directly against it.
Challenged to pronounce on the affair, the stock market commission said the
BBV had acted correctly.
That ruling has probably established a precedent for other takeover battles
in Spain, but the affair has made the authorities uncomfortable and the
commission will have been relieved at yesterday's decision to make a joint
bid.
El Encinar reported profits last year of Pta198m on assets worth Pta13.3bn.
The buyers want to refurbish the former US base housing near Madrid, which
has been paying low, controlled rents since the American forces first
arrived in Spain in the late 1950s.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurance group, has emerged as a potential
bidder for the core life and non-life operations of Hafnia, the troubled
Danish insurer which suspended payments to creditors in August.
The move would be a significant step towards the group's ambition of
achieving a 20 to 25 per cent market share in Scandinavia. It has a
comparatively weak presence in Denmark compared with its operations in
Sweden and Norway. It also renews the group's interest in Hafnia after its
bid to take over the entire group was rebuffed in April.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, the Skandia president, said prices had not been discussed
as the group was not yet involved in active negotiations. Analysts value
Hafnia's domestic non-life and life businesses at a minimum of DKr2bn
(Dollars 328m).
The sale of Hafnia's operations is being handled by the US securities house
Morgan Stanley. It is understood that two other groups are also interested
in Hafnia's Danish operations, including Codan, the Danish insurer which is
majority-owned by Sun Alliance of the UK.
Acquiring Hafnia's non-life business would make Skandia the biggest non-life
insurer in Denmark, with a 20 per cent market share.
Its life share would increase from 1 per cent to about 10 per cent.
At the same time, the group might acquire Hafnia's 14 per cent Skandia
stake, assisting it in its wider ambition of clearing up the uncertainty
surrounding its shareholder base. Some 50 per cent of the group's shares are
in the hands of willing sellers, including a 28 per cent stake held by Uni
Storebrand group, the Norwegian insurer.
Skandia also said it was discussing the sale of Panfinancial, its UK
political risk and credit insurance business, with three continental
European insurance groups.
The group is re-shaping its strategy by sharply limiting its exposure to
reinsurance and concentrating more heavily on direct non-life and life
insurance on the Nordic home market as well as in the UK, US and continental
Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE downturn in the French construction industry has forced Dumez, the
building division of the Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez industrial group, to seek
FFr460m (Dollars 86m) in refinancing.
Dumez confirmed that it had been forced to ask Lyonnaise, its parent
company, for FFr460m in new capital. It also announced plans to streamline
its activities by withdrawing from peripheral businesses and concentrating
on its core construction interests.
This rationalisation plan will be accompanied by more than 500 job losses
among its 30,000 employees, the first at Dumez for over a century. These
cuts are likely to be implemented next March, but a preliminary plan is
expected to be presented to the workforce next week.
Dumez has performed poorly since its merger two years ago with Lyonnaise des
Eaux, one of France's largest industrial concerns.
The Lyonnaise group's construction interests produced a loss of FFr38m in
the first half of this year, thereby depressing the overall increase in
group net profits to just 2 per cent to FFr711m.
Earlier this year, Mr Jean-Paul Parayre, who headed Dumez before the merger,
was ousted as deputy chairman of Lyonnaise.
He has been replaced by Mr Jean-Louis Brault, a Lyonnaise director who
previously worked for Bouygues, France's biggest building group.
BTP, a French bank specialising in building and property, has disclosed
losses of FFr220m for the first half of the year.
The bank has recently been forced to refinance in a FFr1.5bn package. Mr
Jacques Bayle, chairman, said it had called a halt to all new property
development projects and would be shedding 145 of its 668 employees in an
attempt to return to profit.

LONDON &amp; Provincial Shop, a subsidiary of Randsworth Acquisition, said it
could go into receivership within a fortnight, unless a dispute over an
alleged breach of covenant is resolved.
The dispute concerns a Pounds 1.4m sale in 1990 of a property that was
subject to a first charge as security for debenture stock.
The failure to execute a formal release from this charge was seen as a
breach of covenant by the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, the trustee of
the debenture stock.
Late on Friday, Law Debenture served a formal notice on the company
requiring it to make good the alleged breach of covenant.
If their claim is substantiated, they are entitled to appoint a receiver.
London &amp; Provincial Shop said it did not believe there had been a breach of
covenant.
'The directors remain satisfied that at all times the company has acted,
both in relation to this matter and generally, in accordance with the terms
of the Debenture Trust Deed,' it said.

profits amounted to Pounds 16,000, against losses of Pounds 268,000 last
time, restated to allow for new accounting standards.
Mr David Haggett, the retiring non-executive chairman, said the improved
performance should continue in the second half.
The interim dividend is maintained at 3.6p, again uncovered by earnings of
0.33p (losses of 4.23p) per share.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Manders sells arm to Croda for Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manders (Holdings), the paints, inks and property group, has severed its
ties with the industrial paints business with the sale of Mander-Domolac to
Croda International for about Pounds 2.5m.
Mr Roy Fenney, managing director industrial chemicals at Croda, said that
the acquisition would help fill its factory capacity, which is running at
between 50 and 60 per cent.
Mander-Domolac paints are high performance coatings, specific to particular
applications and customers. The business will be transferred to Croda
factories in Hull, Birmingham and Sheffield.

<TEXT>
CAMPBELL &amp; Armstrong, the shop and office fitting group, swung from losses
of Pounds 849,000 to profits of Pounds 30,000 pre-tax for the six months
ended September 30.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 31.3m) reflecting a 'more prudent
approach to tendering' as overall margins remained under pressure.
In view of the difficult prevailing trading environment the interim dividend
is omitted - 1p was paid last time. Declaration of a final will depend on
second half trading.
Earnings of 0.4p compared with previous losses of 4.5p. The shares closed 3p
higher at 17p.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Clarke director rejects allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DIRECTOR of Clarke Foods, the ice-cream manufacturer which went into
receivership in October, yesterday rejected suggestions that he sold shares
illegally in the months preceding the group's collapse.
Mr Martin Riley, a non-executive director, was responding to the call for an
inquiry into Clarke from Mr George Howarth, Labour MP for Knowsely North. Mr
Howarth also urged an inquiry into share sales by Mr Riley and Mr Henry
Clarke, chairman, in May, at 160p, three weeks before they began a decline
to the suspension price of 8p.
Clarke shares had enjoyed a sharp rise in the spring, jumping by 35 per cent
between the general election and the end of May, in spite of difficulties
with the installation of equipment. The market rose only 16 per cent in the
same period.
Mr Riley said last night that there was 'absolutely no question of insider
dealing'. He said the stock market had 'shot up in the post-election
euphoria' and he felt the market had been overvalued.
Mr Riley sold 100,000 shares from his pension fund leaving him with 185,000
shares in a personal holding.
Mr Clarke was not contactable last night. However, the same day as Mr Riley,
he sold 210,000 shares from his pension fund, leaving him with 7.1m shares.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Capital spending cuts Vaux to Pounds 31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUX GROUP, Sunderland-based regional brewer and hotels and nursing homes
operator, held its final dividend at 6.1p in spite of a 10 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 34.3m to Pounds 30.9m.
Results for the 53 weeks to October 3 were depressed by a Pounds 4.65m
increase in interest charges after heavy capital spending on hotels and
pubs.
Spending amounted to Pounds 75m - Pounds 35m on the acquisition of 270 pubs,
Pounds 15m on the completion of new hotels at Bristol and Bexley, Pounds 17m
on refurbishment and Pounds 8m on the breweries.
During the year the group raised Pounds 20m from the sale of the Blayneys
off-licence chain, Pounds 20m from the issue of debenture stock and Pounds
10m from a hotel sale and leaseback.
Trading profits rose 10.9 per cent to Pounds 39.5m (Pounds 35.6m) on
turnover 7.5 per cent lower at Pounds 247m (Pounds 267m).
Earnings per share declined 6.3 per cent from 20.31p to 19.04p.
The total distribution of 9.35p compares with 9.2p last year.
Acquisitions contributed to a 27 per cent increase in profits from Vaux and
Wards breweries and the tenanted pub estate to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 15.3m).
Turnover improved by Pounds 10m to Pounds 98.3m.
The group has bought 448 pubs since 1989 and has 'substantially
strengthened' its regional position in the north of England, said Mr Paul
Nicholson, chairman.
Vaux Inns, taking in the group's 127 managed houses, achieved a 2 per cent
growth in profits, from Pounds 4.65m to Pounds 4.74m, on turnover ahead 10.6
per cent at Pounds 36.6m.
Volume sales through the group's own pubs rose 10.5 per cent - but would
have declined 5 per cent if thenew pubs were excluded. Free trade volumes
were slightly higher.
Profits from St Andrews nursing homes rose 26 per cent from Pounds 3.24m to
Pounds 4.09m and five new homes are planned during the next 18 months.
The recession remained a drag on hotel profits which increased less than 1
per cent to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 12.4m) on turnover up 10.7 per cent to
Pounds 77.9m.
Borrowings increased from Pounds 101m to Pounds 122m and gearing increased
from 20.8 per cent to 32.4 per cent.
COMMENT
Vaux was a bit unlucky to choose 1987 to launch a five-year plan for its
hotels development. It has spent Pounds 178m - and ended in a recession with
its properties devalued by a third and half the profits it forecast. The
last two hotels to be completed, at Bristol and Bexley, cost Pounds 58m and
contributed Pounds 600,000 in operating profits last year. Having taken
another Pounds 1m costs out of the operations, there is not much else to be
done except pray for a speedy end to the recession. A deal of consolation,
in the meantime, is provided by the rapid payback from strengthening the pub
estate with acquisitions in northern England and by the improving prospects
for the group's nursing homes. Analysts forecast profits of between Pounds
26m and Pounds 27m clean of property next year, and on a prospective p/e of
13.5 times rate the stock undervalued on the group's recovery potential.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Avesco, the radio and electronic goods and television and film services
company, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 23,000 for the half year to
September 30.
This compares with a profit of Pounds 147,000 last time but marked a
turnround from losses of Pounds 2.26m for the 1992 year.
Mr Richard Murray, chairman, said that profits for the first six months
would have been substantially higher but for the increase in research and
development expenditure at VideoLogic.
Turnover expanded by Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 11.2m. Finance costs rose to
Pounds 308,000 (Pounds 269,000) and after tax of Pounds 8,000 (Pounds
49,000) earnings came out at 0.025p (0.164p).

<TEXT>
BUTTE MINING, which is claiming damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 214m) in the
US against more than 70 former advisers, directors and investors, has told
shareholders its accounts for the year to end-June will not be ready until
next month but the Companies Act requires it to hold an annual meeting in
1992.
Consequently, the company has arranged its meeting for December 29, to be
followed by an extraordinary meeting early next year to receive and adopt
the accounts.
Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, said that Ernst &amp; Young, formerly Butte's
auditors, resigned after being named as defendants in the US law suit and
have been replaced by Arthur Andersen.
Substantial new work on the accounts was being carried out and it had not
proved possible to prepare them in time for this year's annual meeting.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sage maintains growth record with 33%
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAGE GROUP, a Newcastle-based supplier of accounting software and
stationery, finished the year slightly ahead of analysts' expectations,
recording profits before tax of Pounds 8.85m, up 33 per cent on last year's
Pounds 6.64m.
Sage has now shown significant growth in revenues and pre-tax profits each
year since 1988.
The share price yesterday improved 21p to 455p.
The company also announced the acquisition of Yorkshire Business Forms for
an initial Pounds 1.05m, made up of Pounds 525,000 cash and a similar sum in
new ordinary shares.
Additional payments to a maximum of Pounds 2.95m will be paid over two years
dependant on net profits in the period. Up to half the deferred payment may
be made in shares.
Turnover rose 36 per cent to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 20m) in the year ended
September 30, of which Pounds 11.1m came from US operations.
Earnings per share rose 21 per cent to 30.9p (25.5p) and the total dividend
is raised 12 per cent to 9.02p (8.05p) via a final of 6p.
Cash balances rose sharply to close at Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 1.2m) but have
now been reduced by the purchase of Remote Control International in
California, Ciel in France and Yorkshire Business Forms. The company remains
strongly cash-generative.
During the year Sage decided to discontinue MainLan, its US operation which
specialises in networking software - losses amounted to Pounds 400,000 of
which Pounds 250,000 were closure costs. Sage will continue to market
MainLan in the UK where it has proved successful.
DacEasy, a US accounting software company acquired two years ago, seems to
be proving its worth with operating profits of Pounds 2.2m on sales of
Pounds 10.2m.
COMMENT
Sage's strength and the secret of its ability to generate cash is its
extensive customer list in the US and UK, It makes what it terms 'annuity'
sales to these customers - upgrades and new versions of software packages
and stationery. Abandoning the MainLan disaster in the US has removed one of
the few downsides to Sage's progress. Others are a risk of a decline in UK
packaged software prices to US levels and an over-ambitious acquisition
strategy. Sage's management, however, has to date proved level headed -
DacEasy, for example, is beginning to deliver its full potential. A rash of
new products suggests that analysts' expectations of Pounds 10.9m pre-tax
for 1993, giving an undemanding prospective p/e of about 12, will not be
disappointed.

SOME Pounds 20m in government finance for the Laganbank property development
project in Belfast was approved yesterday, giving the go-ahead to Ewart, the
project's lead developer, to begin contracting for an estimated Pounds 110m
in construction work.
Mr Barry Gilligan, managing director of the Belfast-based company said:
'This is excellent news for Ewart . . . the government has quite rightly
recognised the importance of this huge capital investment to the long term
future of the Northern Ireland economy.'
The development is the centrepiece of the government's Laganside development
plan and will include a new concert hall to be financed by the Belfast City
Council, a 200-bedroom hotel, 400,000 sq ft of office space as well as
retail space and car parking. The complex will be located near the Belfast
City Hall.
Last month, Monarch Properties, the private property developer based in
Dublin, sold its 29.2 per stake in Ewart for 80p per share, having failed in
its attempt to take control of the board.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: East Midlands advances 23% - Electricity
group opposes one-year, coal-fired power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAST MIDLANDS Electricity yesterday reported a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 30.3m for the six months ended September 30.
At the same time East Midlands voiced opposition to a one-year, coal-fired
power deal between electricity generators and the regional companies.
Mr John Harris, chairman of the company, which is leading heads of agreement
talks with PowerGen and National Power, said he preferred five-year
contracts because they would provide more stability for the coal and
electricity industries.
A one-year deal would not provide assurances of falling prices in later
years as would a five-year agreement.
Mr Harris's comments follow suggestions by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
president of the Board of Trade, that a one-year deal could be concluded,
although he also said any review should not prejudice the outcome of the
white paper.
Mr Harris also said he was opposed to postponing the liberalisation of the
electricity market from 1994 if that led to higher prices for customers.
Turnover for the opening half year rose to Pounds 681.5m (Pounds 658.1m).
The interim dividend is stepped up to 5.72p, a 12 per cent increase on last
time's 5.1p. Earnings per share emerged at 10.1p (8.2p).
Losses in the supply business were reduced from Pounds 35m to Pounds 20m, in
part because of the recovery of uplift charges from last year but also as a
result of customers taking contracts with a smaller price difference between
winter and summer.
Distribution profits, made on steady volumes, were down Pounds 4m to Pounds
60m and retail, which is being restructured as a result of the joint venture
with Yorkshire Electricity, lost Pounds 600,000, against a Pounds 600,000
profit in the comparable period a year earlier.
Mr Harris said retailing was profitable in the second quarter, however, and
that there would be a small operating profit in the full year.
Six small shops are to be closed by next March leaving 65.
Contracting would incur a loss this year although in line with other recs
East Midlands would soon feel the benefit of changed terms and conditions of
contracting employees, the numbers of which have been reduced from 800 to
600.
COMMENT
The beauty of electricity for investors is that it combines safety with a
strong dividend flow. The market's perception of East Midlands is that it is
less safe than other recs and as a result the dividend yield is among
highest in the sector. The company concerns critics through its
individualistic stance. Mr Harris's propensity to stand up and be counted,
as demonstrated by his comments on the one-year deal yesterday, matter less
than the declared aim of seeking 30 per cent of profits outside of the
regulated business by the year 2000 and the possibility that it will
participate, albeit in a small way, with the Union of Democratic Workers in
a bid for a part of British Coal. There appears little wrong with the
non-core business but until it performs outstandingly East Midlands' shares,
on a prospective yield of 6.3 per cent assuming a full year dividend of
19.15p, will struggle to catch up with other recs.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Charter slips to Pounds 37.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTER Consolidated, the industrial holding company in which Minorco, the
investment vehicle of Anglo-American, holds 36 per cent, announced a slight
fall in profits due to lower interest earnings.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 37.1m in the six months to
September 30. A seasonal cash outflow, and lower interest rates, cut
Charter's net interest receivable by Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5.8m as net cash
fell Pounds 20m to Pounds 122m.
Turnover increased 4.3 per cent to Pounds 605.7m, helped by growth in the
rail track equipment and building services divisions. Operating profits
increased from Pounds 30.2m to Pounds 31.3m.
Pandrol International, which makes rail fasteners and track maintenance
equipment, recorded operating profits of Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 6.6m).
Cape, the building products and services division, increased turnover 31 per
cent to Pounds 127.9m but operating profits were unchanged at Pounds 6.4m.
Mining equipment reported unchanged profits of Pounds 2m while quarrying and
mining increased profits slightly to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.6m).
Johnson Matthey, the metals company in which Charter owns 38.4 per cent,
increased its contribution to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 12.5m).
Mr Nigel Robson, finance director, said capital expenditure increased from
Pounds 9m to Pounds 11.9m. High average exchange rates, especially for the
dollar, cost the company Pounds 175,000. There was an extraordinary profit
of Pounds 1.4m on the write-back of prior-year provisions against an
overseas investment, Mr Robson said.
Earnings fell to 21.8p (22.4p). The interim dividend is maintained at 7p.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BTP hits Pounds 10m with help from
purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTP, the speciality chemicals company, increased pre-tax profits by 15 per
cent to Pounds 10.1m in the six months to September 30 with the help of
contributions from two French acquisitions.
Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, said continental Europe accounted for 33 per
cent of group sales compared with 24 per cent in the same period of last
year. First-half turnover rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 99m.
The new adhesives companies joined the chemical division, adding about
Pounds 700,000 to operating profit of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.23m). The
division had sales of Pounds 55m (Pounds 41.5m).
Most of the Pounds 6.3m capital spending went to the biocides division,
which saw profits slip to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 2.04m). Sales rose to Pounds
17.7m (Pounds 15.6m).
Mr Buckley said the most important growth trend lay in the switch from
solvent-based to water-based materials, such as adhesives and paints. A new
factory near Blackburn would next year start producing a bug-killing
ingredient for the water-based products.
On the industrial side, the mainly UK profit declined to Pounds 1.83m
(Pounds 2.15m) on sales of Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 25.3m). About 70 per cent of
the sales were accounted for by the fall-arrest, safety equipment business,
which was still growing. Another part of the division was being sold.
A small amount of interest was received compared with Pounds 602,000 charges
in the first half of last year. The Pounds 6.5m cash held in March turned
into Pounds 767,000 net debt after a bulge in capital spending to build the
new factory.
Earnings slipped to 6.96p (7.1p) but the interim dividend goes up to 3.25p
(3.1p).
COMMENT
Nervousness about BTP's resilience caused the shares to underperform the
market by more than 20 per cent since June. These results breathed relief
into sentiment and the price gained 11p to close at 218p. The two thirds of
sales outside the UK have limited recessionary damage so far, although the
continental businesses are expected to face tougher conditions. Once again
the group has integrated acquisitions well and next year the biocides
factory promises to inject more organic growth. Annual pre-tax profit is
forecast to rise from Pounds 18.2m to about Pounds 21m, although earnings
would do well to top last year's 14.81p - leaving this line a bit droopy
since 1990-91. While a prospective multiple of 15 looks fair, there may be a
bit more post-results applause. On a longer time scale, the company has a
neat trick of converting froth into paper for acquisitions. With a smooth
hand-over under way between Mr Buckley and his heir apparent, there seems
little to unsettle the BTP fan club.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Berisford losses at Pounds 22.3m as
acquisitions are sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD International, the commodities and property group that nearly went
into receivership in 1990, is looking to expand once more through
acquisitions.
The group announced annual results yesterday, showing a loss of Pounds 22.3m
before tax, against a Pounds 20.5m deficit in the preceding year to
September 30.
The company has tax losses of Pounds 365m in the US, Pounds 40m in the UK
and Pounds 19m of advance corporation tax which can be recouped. The US
losses can be used for up to 15 years but would vanish if Berisford were
taken over.
Mr Alan Bowkett, who joined as chief executive at the start of the year,
said he was now spending 75 per cent of his time looking to the future.
Acquisitions would be funded by equity and borrowings.
Mr Bowkett said he was 'working very hard' on a deal, and was 'not afraid of
debt'. He was looking to buy in areas of industrial manufacturing and
distribution, building products or food, and planned initially to buy in the
UK. He wanted a company with 'a sound product' and hoped for a friendly deal
with the target's shareholders, if not its management.
Mr Roy Hammond is to join Berisford as operations director in January. Mr
Bowkett and Mr Hammond have worked together in two other companies. Mr Peter
Butler, the finance director who has overseen repayment of Pounds 1.5bn of
debt, is leaving in the new year.
Mr Bowkett said that all the group's problems had now been addressed and
there were no more 'black holes'. All the off-balance sheet debt had been
brought on balance sheet and he anticipated an unqualified auditors' report
on the accounts.
At year-end net debt was Pounds 15m (Pounds 18.6m cash), but asset sales
since then should give the company net cash by the new year. Early repayment
of remaining term debt is planned which will leave the group with four
banks, compared with 68 banks when it entered refinancing talks.
Shareholders' funds at the year end were Pounds 84.6m and have stabilised at
that level since then, Mr Bowkett said.
Turnover fell to Pounds 130.5m from Pounds 694.2m, reflecting disposals. Mr
Bowkett said the ongoing business had sales of about Pounds 50m a year but
central overheads, at about Pounds 5m a year, were high for the size of
business.
Pre-interest losses were Pounds 2.7m (profit Pounds 21.2m) and interest cost
Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 19.6m). Exceptional items of Pounds 18.7m (Pounds
22.1m) included property write-downs of Pounds 16.3m. Extraordinary debits
totalled Pounds 42.7m (credit Pounds 76.1m). There was a transfer from
reserves of Pounds 67.1m (retained profit of Pounds 62.1m).
Losses per share were 4.9p (2.9p). The group is planning to consolidate its
10p shares into 50p shares to reduce the bid-offer spread and cut dealing
costs.
COMMENT
Berisford's survival in any form is a remarkable achievement. But assessing
its future as an investment is another matter. The share price of 18 1/2 p,
down  1/2 p yesterday, is close to net asset value of 17p a share which, in
the absence of profits and dividends, is probably about right. From here on
the shares are highly speculative, depending on Mr Bowkett and his team
picking a suitable first target and being able to attract investors to
finance a large enough deal. If they succeed, and build on that achievement,
the eventual prize will be the unlocking of the US tax losses. Not one for
the faint hearted.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is today expected to make a bid for a 25 per cent stake in
Qantas, the Australian national carrier due to be privatised next year.
The BA board met yesterday and is understood to have agreed the bid. A
formal notification will be made today, the Australian government's deadline
for bids from foreign airlines for a stake in Qantas.
BA is expected to face stiff competition from Singapore Airlines and Air New
Zealand.
Under the Australian government's rules, the maximum stake a foreign carrier
can acquire is 25 per cent, thought to be worth between ADollars 600m and
ADollars 750m (Pounds 340m) depending on the Australian government's
decision on how much it is prepared to recapitalise the airline before
privatisation.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, said yesterday
that a partnership between the UK carrier and Qantas would make 'a very good
fit'.
Qantas would give BA a much stronger presence in the Asia-Pacific market
which continues to show the fastest growth of any aviation market.
Sir Colin sought to dampen Australian fears that BA was seeking to take
control of Qantas.
'There seems to be a misconception in Australia that our only interest is in
taking over Qantas. It isn't. Qantas will remain an Australian airline under
Australian control.'
The US government is expected to make a decision by Christmas on BA's
proposed acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars 750m
(Pounds 493m). Sir Colin said USAir had called an extraordinary meeting on
December 18 to approve the partnership.
The deal continues to face fierce opposition from the big three US airlines,
American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Tomkins likely to have no net debt after
RHM buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, the conglomerate, is likely to end up with no net debt after its
Pounds 935m acquisition of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and
grocery products company, according to the company's advisers.
Costs relating to the likely closure of a number of bakeries will, however,
leave the group with some net gearing. Before its move on RHM, Tomkins had
net cash of about Pounds 150m.
Tomkins said yesterday that as of Monday it had received valid acceptances
representing about 61.97 per cent of the RHM ordinary shares. The company
had also bought 22 per cent of the shares for cash during the offer period.
RHM shareholders representing some 44 per cent of acceptances opted for
Tomkins cash alternative to the ordinary offer. Some 37 per cent elected for
the all share offer while 18 per cent accepted the ordinary offer which
involved a split of cash and shares.
The advisers said the pattern of acceptances had left Tomkins 'broadly
neutral' with no cash or net debt and in line with what it was hoping for at
the outset of the bid.
Yesterday's announcement suggested shareholders have cast aside their
immediate worries about the bid. Early in the bid, concern that Tomkins had
bitten off more than it could chew had helped push the shares close to the
200p price of the rights issue that is partly financing the deal.
Yesterday, however, Tomkins shares responded to the level of acceptances by
jumping 7 1/2 p to 238 1/2 p. This was some 10p above the price at which
Tomkins' share offers was worth more than the cash alternative.
BZW, the company's advisers, said it had sent notice of the second
instalment of the rights issue to Tomkins shareholders.
Tomkins is unlikely to make any early statement on the number of RHM's
bakeries it is likely to close or the level of related acquisition
provisions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANSFIELD Brewery, the Yorkshire and east Midlands brewer, lifted pre-tax
profits from Pounds Pounds 6.36m to Pounds 6.67m in the 26 weeks to
September 26.
Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 60.8m (Pounds 59m). Mr Joss Nangle,
acting chairman since the death of Mr Geoffrey Kent in September, said that
sales volumes of draught beers advanced by 4.3 per cent against an estimated
regional decline of 3.5 per cent.
The success with draught sales, along with 'continued strong control over
costs' resulted in trading profits up 13 per cent at Pounds 6.65m. This was
struck after a Pounds 900,000 provision for bad and doubtful debts in the
free trade.
Earnings per share inched up to 28.8p (28.4p) and the interim dividend is
lifted 10 per cent to 4.4p (4p).

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Ossory Pounds 41.6m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OSSORY Estates, the property group, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of
Pounds 41.6m for the year ended June 30 after heavy write-downs of its
property portfolio.
The company's accounts have been qualified because it is in talks with its
banks following the breach of its banking covenants. 'Whilst the accounts
have been prepared on a going concern basis, such a basis will be valid only
if agreement with the group's banks is forthcoming and if sufficient working
capital is raised from property disposals,' the company said.
Ossory said it was hopeful that an agreement would be reached with the banks
and it anticipated writing to shareholders shortly.
The company described its results as 'a very serious setback'. It blamed its
difficulties on excessive borrowing, speculative development, cost overruns
and a level of overheads that was inconsistent with the size of the company.
'The board takes no consolation from the general problems in the property
sector and it is not content to await an economic recovery for a revival of
the group's fortunes,' it said.
The company said it intended to maintain stringent controls over overheads
and to address the anomalies of yield, location and quality in the property
portfolio. It made sales of Pounds 41.1m during the last financial year.
The board underwent substantial changes during the year including the
resignation of Mr Brett Allen and Mr Joseph Shaoul, joint managing
directors. The company said it intended to strengthen the board of directors
and the company's management within the agreed overhead targets, as soon as
practicable.
The provisions stemmed from a Pounds 11.1m write-down against investment
properties, a Pounds 15.4m write-down against development properties and
Pounds 16.1m write-down against interests in associated undertakings,
investments and debtors. There was also a Pounds 4.6m write-down against the
revaluation reserve.
Net assets per share fell from 79.41p to 19.32p. There were losses per share
of 53.15p, compared with earnings per share of 5.15p. No final dividend is
proposed.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Eurocopy falls 76% to Pounds 1.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Eurocopy fell 76 per cent to Pounds 1.7m in the year to
end-September, as the office equipment distributor struggled to repair the
damage resulting from adverse publicity over sales practices at a Scottish
subsidiary.
For the first four months Eurocopy had been under investigation by the
Office of Fair Trading - it was eventually cleared - and the remaining eight
months were 'perhaps the worst in living memory,' Mr Michael Armitage,
finance director, said.
Efforts to rebuild sales, which melted largely due to the inquiry, had been
thwarted by recession. Turnover for the 12 months to September 30 declined
by 22 per cent to Pounds 34.2m.
Hardest hit had been the machine sales division, which accounted for some
Pounds 5m of the decline in group turnover. This business incurred a loss of
Pounds 4.5m.
The group's struggling furniture business suffered a loss of Pounds 1m
during the year. Eurocopy is reviewing several options for this operation
and a decision is expected soon.
Eurocopy's servicing operations suffered from a decline in copy volumes.
The company had taken action to cut costs, including a 19 per cent reduction
in employee numbers. It was estimated that annual savings would be about
Pounds 1m.
The dividend was cut by 2.4p to 0.5p for a total of 1.6p (4p). Earnings per
share tumbled from 9.49p to 2.32p.
COMMENT
Eurocopy has truly had an 'annus horribilis'. Yet with this set of results,
one might hope that things can only get better. Still, it will be a long,
hard slog to rebuild business, particularly in Scotland where the losses ran
to Pounds 1m. This is a group which truly needs economic recovery. Short of
that, Eurocopy should benefit from cost cutting. Analysts are forecasting
about Pounds 2.5m for this year, based on flat servicing profits and reduced
losses in machine sales. If the company does something about the furniture
division, then profits could be as much as Pounds 500,000 better. The
prospective p/e of 11 leaves the shares fairly valued in the short-term.
However, economic recovery could change the whole ballgame on a longer-term
basis.

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Cuts help raise Siebe by 6.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COST-CUTTING helped Siebe, the UK-based international engineering systems
and controls group, increase interim pre-tax profits in spite of lower
sales.
Turnover fell by 6.8 per cent to Pounds 757.3m in the six months to
September 30, but the pre-tax profits were 6.8 per cent higher at Pounds
80.3m (Pounds 75.2m).
Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman, said there were glimmers of recovery in the US
 -particularly in consumer-related goods - but this would be partly offset
by signs of a slowdown in Germany and Japan.
The group had achieved higher margins by better cash management, tight
control of working capital and staff reductions, mainly in the US.
A total of 1,200 jobs were shed during the six months, bringing the group's
total workforce down to 31,000, compared with 38,000 three years ago.
More than 90 per cent of Siebe's sales go outside the UK, with the US
accounting for about 45 per cent. Had these results been translated at last
year's exchange rates, the sales figure would have been Pounds 30.9m higher
and the pre-tax profits figure up Pounds 2.7m.
Siebe welcomed the recent devaluation of sterling and said it was likely to
reverse the first half's adverse translation effect, assuming that the pound
stayed at its present level.
Mr Stephens said the group had completed the integration of Foxboro, the US
industrial controls group which it bought for Dollars 650m in 1990, and was
now on the look-out for further acquisition opportunities.
Net cash flow was Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 36.3m) and net indebtedness was
Pounds 490m, giving gearing of 68.7 per cent, compared with 88.4 per cent
last year. The group said it was on target to reduce the gearing figure to
the mid-50s by next year.
Mr Stephens said the group spent the equivalent of 4.1 per cent of sales on
research and development, of which it capitalised Pounds 14m during the
half-year.
Siebe's tax rate was 41.9 per cent (41.4 per cent). It included a write-off
of Pounds 700,000 on unrelieved advance corporation tax, down from Pounds 2m
thanks to increased repatriation of royalties.
Earnings per share rose by 5.4 per cent to 11.7p (11.1p) and the dividend is
increased by 10 per cent to 3.3275p (3.025p).

Profits of Bogod Group, a seller of sewing machines and parts, were little
changed at Pounds 105,000 pre-tax for the six months ended September 30.
The figure, which compared with Pounds 102,000 previously, was scored from a
turnover marginally lower at Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 2.66m). The interim
dividend on the A shares is held at 0.2p from earnings of 1.22p (1.19p).

FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: OIS returning to market with Pounds 15m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIS International Inspection, the technical inspection services group, is
seeking a Pounds 15m listing on the Stock Exchange because its owner, Adia -
the troubled Swiss employment group - is continuing to dispose of non-core
interests.
The listing, scheduled for December 22 with the placing of 30m shares of 50p
each, effectively marks the return of OIS to the Stock Exchange after a
five-year absence.
In 1988, the group was taken over by a consortium led by Mr Paul Bristol,
who changed its name to Brompton Holdings, then listed it on the USM.
Brompton had a chequered career and was bought by Adia for Pounds 11.7m in
June 1989.
Mr Malcolm Russell, managing director of OIS, said yesterday the listing was
prompted by the changing focus at Adia, but the group was in a good position
to go public.
OIS had a wide operational base, selling its services to the construction,
oil, transport and power generation industries, with customers such as Shell
and British Gas. The business was driven by regulatory requirements for
non-destructive testing - using ultrasonics and radiography - of
installations for safety, quality and environmental purposes.
Turnover improved from Pounds 27m in 1989 to more than Pounds 40m, of which
40 per cent came from the Middle East, the Far East and Africa.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Tending to Airbus's clipped wings: Paul Betts on the likely
damage caused by Northwest's cancelled order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Airbus consortium has just suffered its worst setback in its
20-year history with the largest cancellation of new aircraft orders from
its single biggest customer.
The decision of Northwest Airlines of the US to cancel orders for 74 Airbus
aircraft worth Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn) was said yesterday to have come
as a 'bombshell' to one City aerospace analyst.
Northwest, with 140 Airbus aircraft orders, of which 34 have already been
delivered, was the largest customer of Airbus. GPA, the Irish leasing
company, has 123 orders, Lufthansa of Germany has 111 orders, and Air France
67 orders.
The blow for Airbus is more painful because it involves the European
consortium's latest jet, the A340 long-range widebody aircraft due to enter
service next year. Northwest, one of the A340 launch customers, cancelled
all its 24 orders for the new Airbus as well as cancelling orders for 50
A320 twin-engine aircraft.
The full scale of recession in the airline industry has been brought home to
Airbus. A month ago, Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chief executive, reached an
agreement with GPA over the rescheduling of the deliveries of 82 Airbus
aircraft between now and 2003.
The consortium has also faced cancellations and order delays from other
troubled airlines this year and there are likely to be more in coming
months, although none on the scale of Northwest.
During a recent record-breaking 15 hour and 21 minute non-stop A340 test
flight between Frankfurt and Honolulu, Mr Pierson admitted that 'nobody
knows when the industry pick-up will happen'. He said the civil aerospace
industry would remain under intense pressure well into next year and
probably into 1994.
The industry is still suffering from overcapacity. During the past two
years, the three main manufacturers - Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in the US
and Airbus in Europe - have added about 10 per cent in new passenger seat
capacity at a time when airline traffic was slowing. In 1991 airline traffic
fell 3 per cent, the first fall since the second world war.
The rate of new aircraft production will have to be cut by 25 per cent to 30
per cent during the next three to four years to bring capacity in line with
demand. This will involve a cut in deliveries by the big three manufacturers
from more than 800 new aircraft deliveries both in 1991 and 1992 to around
550 annual deliveries during the next four years.
For Airbus, the immediate implication of the Northwest cancellations will be
a further scaling back of its production plans.
Airbus has already announced a cut in the rate of future production. It had
originally expected to see production rise from 160 aircraft this year to
220 aircraft in 1995 as new aircraft, including the A340, the A330 and the
A321, started rolling off the assembly line. Last month, it said it did not
expect to produce more than 180 aircraft in 1995. It will now have to trim
production targets even further.
This is bound to have a big impact on all four Airbus industrial partners -
British Aerospace (20 per cent), Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent),
Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent).
BAe, which makes all wings for Airbus aircraft, has already scaled back wing
production at its Chester facility to reflect the retrenchment in Airbus
output. The Northwest cancellation alone, according to Mr Hodgkinson, could
cost BAe around Pounds 100m in lost turnover as each A320 wing set accounts
for about Pounds 5m of turnover and each larger A340 wing set for around
Pounds 10m.
The cuts in future production are expected to put additional pressure on
jobs in the European aerospace industry. In the UK alone, Airbus supports
about 30,000 jobs at some 300 companies, as well as about 7,000 jobs at BAe
itself.
The continuing recession in the airline industry is also likely to delay
Airbus plans to develop new products. Airbus had hoped to launch at the end
of this year a programme to build a smaller 125-seat derivative of the
150-seat A320 twin-engine aircraft.
Mr Pierson recently said he did not expect the programme to be launched
before next March. Now airlines in the depressed market are unlikely to
commit themselves to buy the new aircraft.
The Northwest cancellation, as well as other order deferrals and
cancellations, is likely to force Airbus to make hefty provisions against
future aircraft delivery risks when it closes its 1992 accounts in February.
Mr Pierson expects Airbus to show an operating surplus in 1992 for the
second year running of around Pounds 220m. But he has also warned that the
consortium's net profits would depend on the amount of provisions Airbus
will have to make to cover financial risks.
Mr Pierson is convinced the market will eventually rebound, and Airbus will
be in a strong position to take advantage of the recovery with its broad
family of technologically advanced airliners. But he recently remarked: 'As
I surveyed the battered and beaten state of the airline business, I could
not help but recall one of Murphy's Laws of Life: 'You can't win . . . you
can't break even . . . and you can't quit.''

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's largest bank, yesterday reported group operating
profits down by 5 per cent in the first 10 months of the year. The fall was
worse than analysts' expectations and contrasted sharply with the robust
figures of Deutsche's competitors.
It prompted Deutsche's share price to fall by DM13.9 to DM653.1, helping to
drag the DAX index of 30 leading German shares down by 17.08 to 1,508.24.
Total operating profits fell from DM5.20bn to DM4.94bn (Pounds 1.9bn) while
partial operating profit, which excludes the bank's own account trading,
dropped 3.8 per cent to DM3.96bn.
The fall contrasts with reported growth of 16.6 per cent in total operating
profits at Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, of 13.3 per cent at
Commerzbank, the third largest bank, 13.2 per cent at the Bayerische
Hypotheken und Wechsel-Bank and more than 20 per cent at Bayerische
Vereinsbank.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive, said net profits for the full year would
be at least as good as they were last year.
He said Deutsche Bank's profits were bigger than those of the next three
competitors put together and insisted the relative strength of the bank
would become clear at the full-year stage after provisioning for bad debts.
Last year net profits rose from DM1.07bn to DM1.41bn while operating profits
rose 16 per cent to a record DM5.97bn.
A fall in profits was expected after Deutsche's interim profits fell 3.2 per
cent after six months.
Mr Kopper said staff numbers would probably drop by 1,000 over the course of
the year.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Video sales help Carlton rise 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON Communications, the television and film services company, yesterday
announced a 15 per cent profits increase helped by strong sales of video
cassettes, especially in the US.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 88.3m to Pounds 102.3m in the year to
September 30. Mr Michael Green, chairman, described the performance as 'good
progress in a tough year'.
The results were in line with stock market expectations, although the shares
slipped 2p to 717p on light profit-taking. Analysts expect Carlton, which
takes over the London weekday TV franchise from Thames on January 1, to make
profits of about Pounds 128m this year.
Video and audio production and distribution lifted profits 49.8 per cent to
Pounds 46.6m. Video cassette production for customers such as Walt Disney
and Warner grew strongly in line with the US 'sell through' market.
Pickwick, the European video and budget music distributor acquired in
February, contributed Pounds 1m of operating profit on Pounds 42m of sales,
although this did not include the busy Christmas season.
The television and film services division was affected by high average US
dollar exchange rates at its Technicolor film processing subsidiary. Profits
fell from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 25.1m.
Video and sound products, which includes specialist production equipment
sales to the TV industry, continued to recover and increased profits 39 per
cent to Pounds 19.4m.
Carlton's net cash balance declined from Pounds 162.6m to Pounds 108.5m due
to increased working capital needs and investments. Net interest earnings
fell from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 10.5m. Profits from associates, mainly a 20
per cent stake in Central independent TV, increased from Pounds 2.8m to
Pounds 6.69m.
Operating costs of Pounds 12.7m incurred by Carlton TV were deferred until
the station begins broadcasting.
Group turnover excluding associates increased 18 per cent to Pounds 635.2m.
At the interim stage, turnover was 13 per cent higher at Pounds 324.7m while
pre-tax profits grew 7 per cent to Pounds 49.4m.
Earnings per share increased 15.5 per cent to 34.2p. A final dividend of
10.3p is proposed to raise the total for the year by 10 per cent to 17p.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Warburg to lead third BT share offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
S. G. WARBURG was yesterday appointed to act as global co-ordinator,
financial adviser and lead broker in the UK government's third sale of
shares in British Telecommunications.
The government is expected to sell most, if not all, of its 22 per cent BT
shareholding, which is worth Pounds 5.4bn at last night's closing price of
401p. However, ministers are expected to make their final decision on the
size of the sale as late as possible to ensure that demand exceeds supply.
The BT share sale is part of the government's plans to raise Pounds 5.5bn
from privatisation over the coming year and a similar sum in 1994-95. The
structure of the last BT sale will be used as a springboard for the next
sale, involving offers to both retail and institutional investors.
Retail investors will be offered some inducement to buy shares. Last time,
they received a 45p discount on the 350p price paid by institutions.
The Treasury plans to develop last year's use of 'share shops' to promote
its goal of wider share ownership. Cheap dealing rates were available to
investors registering with a share shop in the last sale.
It may increase the number of preferred retailers to issue the third tranche
of BT shares. Last year's BT sale involved just eight share shops, which
excluded smaller share service companies which specialise in selling shares
to the public.
The role of regional lead managers in Europe may also change. While no
decision has yet been taken, the government may feel it unnecessary to
appoint formal lead managers throughout continental Europe.
S. G. Warburg may decide it has sufficient access to the main investors and
therefore take a more direct role in selling the shares to big institutions.
Ministers expect it will be easier to market the shares this time because
the regulatory and political environment is more stable. The last sale was
dogged by uncertainty before a general election and a price review by Oftel,
the regulatory body.
The government has already sold two tranches of shares in BT. The first was
in 1984 and the second was last December. Investors who took part in the
last sale still have to pay their third instalment on March 2.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Sturge Holdings considers Lloyd's plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STURGE HOLDINGS is planning an new insurance venture to take advantage of
the possible move towards corporate capital at the Lloyd's of London
insurance market.
News of the development emerged yesterday when Sturge, the biggest group of
agencies at Lloyd's, reported a 12.5 per cent cut in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 7.75m for the year to September 30. The dividend was reduced by 50
per cent to 8.25p.
The venture, which would initially have between Pounds 25m and Pounds 50m in
capital, could either be a fully-fledged insurance company regulated by the
Department of Trade and Industry or a new form of insurance organisation
operating under the Lloyd's umbrella.
In either case the venture, backed by outside capital, could reinsure the 24
Lloyd's syndicates managed by Sturge.
Mr Peter Davis, deputy chairman and finance director, said that Sturge had
discussed the idea with the DTI and Lloyd's although no final decision had
been taken. 'It is still some way off,' he added.
Sturge was particularly interested in persuading pension fund and other
institutional investors to back its venture, said Mr Davis.
Lloyd's is still investigating the practicality of attracting corporate
capital to the market in the wake of the recommendations of the Rowland task
force earlier this year.
The group's fall in profits was largely due to a cut in profit commission
(paid by syndicates to the agency), reflecting a poor performance in the
1989 underwriting year at Lloyd's, where results are reported three years in
arrears. Profit commissions fell from Pounds 14.08m to Pounds 5.91m and
agency fees fell to Pounds 14.58m from Pounds 16.31m.
The decline in income was only partially offset by a rise in fees and
commissions from other sources to Pounds 3.03m, from Pounds 242,000, and
increased turnover at the group's Wise Speke stockbroking subsidiary to
Pounds 9.64m from Pounds 8.49m.
Overall turnover of Pounds 33.16m (against Pounds 39.12m) exceeded expenses
of Pounds 29.02m (down from Pounds 35.23m) by Pounds 4.14m. Net interest and
other income receivable fell to Pounds 3.61m from Pounds 4.99m.
Mr David Coleridge, the outgoing chairman of Lloyd's who is also chairman of
Sturge, said reduced profit commission from the 1990 and 1991 underwriting
years, which are also likely to produce losses, would affect future
profitability.
New charges at Lloyd's, including contributions to the market's hardship
fund, would mean that shareholders and Names - the individuals whose assets
support the market - must wait until 1992 underwriting account 'before a
significant profit recovery can be expected', added Mr Coleridge.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Deutsche Bank bucks trend with 5% fall in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's largest bank, yesterday reported group operating
profits down by 5 per cent in the first 10 months of the year. The fall was
worse than analysts' expectations and contrasted sharply with the robust
figures of Deutsche's competitors.
It prompted Deutsche's share price to fall by DM13.9 to DM653.1, helping to
drag the DAX index of 30 leading German shares down by 17.08 to 1,508.24.
Total operating profits fell from DM5.20bn to DM4.94bn (Pounds 1.9bn) while
partial operating profit, which excludes the bank's own account trading,
dropped 3.8 per cent to DM3.96bn.
The fall contrasts with reported growth of 16.6 per cent in total operating
profits at Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, of 13.3 per cent at
Commerzbank, the third largest bank, 13.2 per cent at the Bayerische
Hypotheken und Wechsel-Bank and more than 20 per cent at Bayerische
Vereinsbank.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive, said net profits for the full year would
be at least as good as they were last year.
He said Deutsche Bank's profits were bigger than those of the next three
competitors put together and insisted the relative strength of the bank
would become clear at the full-year stage after provisioning for bad debts.
Last year net profits rose from DM1.07bn to DM1.41bn while operating profits
rose 16 per cent to a record DM5.97bn.
A fall in profits was expected after Deutsche's interim profits fell 3.2 per
cent after six months. The bank said then that its size meant that it felt
the slowdown of the German economy earlier than its competitors.
Mr Kopper blamed a shift in revenue mix toward lower margin interbank
business for the profits fall. Other factors were lower trading profits
together with the effect of the appreciation of the D-Mark against other
currencies. Analysts also blamed a lower return on bank lending to eastern
Germany.
Total credit grew 5.7 per cent to DM316.7bn, while net interest income rose
4.2 per cent to DM9.10bn; net interest margins dropped 10 basis points to
2.31 per cent. Commission income rose 7.2 per cent to DM3.39bn.
Mr Kopper said staff numbers would probably drop by 1,000 over the course of
the year.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Hindu leaders arrested after wave of riots: Death toll
following destruction of Ayodhya mosque climbs to more than 450
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI, ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERSHIP of India's rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party was
arrested yesterday for allegedly instigating riots, the death toll from
which rose by 180 to more than 450 since Monday night.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, made some headway in his efforts
to calm the crisis, caused by the destruction by Hindu militants of a mosque
in the northern town of Ayodhya.
Government officials took comfort from the bloodless recapture of the
disputed site by paramilitary police at dawn and from a lessening of
violence in several states. However, communal frenzy continued unabated in
six states.
Police firing and street clashes between Hindus and Moslems brought Bombay
and many parts of Maharashtra state to a halt, with 65 more deaths
yesterday, taking the toll there to 125. In nearby Gujarat, 11 more people
died yesterday, raising the death count in the state to 72.
The army, which was called out in some Indian states on Monday, continued to
be deployed in Uttar Pradesh, where Ayodhya is located, and in parts of
Madhya Pradesh.
Five leaders of the Hindu BJP, including Mr LK Advani, opposition leader,
and Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, the party president, were arrested.
This move, together with the government's restored control of the disputed
site, and an assurance by Mr Rao that a mosque would be rebuilt alongside a
temple in Ayodhya, provided temporary respite to the government, which has
been criticised for its inability to avert Sunday's events.
Political tensions remained high as the BJP, which had organised the rally
that led to the mosque's destruction, warned of a Hindu backlash if a mosque
was reconstructed on the site they believe is the birthplace of the god Ram.
The BJP and its allies, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayam
Sevak Sangh, pledged to fight the plan. The Hindu parties also promised to
campaign for mosques on other disputed sites to be returned to Hindus.
Defiant BJP MPs called a nationwide strike today to protest against the
arrest of their leaders, claiming no responsibility for the communal carnage
their actions had precipitated.
Ayodhya itself remained calm, with thousands of devotees leaving the town
before noon.
Indian Moslem leaders appealed to Moslems around the world to avoid
violence, including attacks on Hindu temples. They welcomed the arrest of
the BJP leaders.
Farhan Bokhari adds from Islamabad: At least 20 people were killed as
protests against the demolition of the mosque took place across Pakistan
yesterday and the country observed a day of mourning.
In the capital, Islamabad, police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd trying
to break through a security cordon around the Indian high commission.
In Bangladesh, at least six were killed and more than 500 injured as groups
clashed during a general strike.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Generators may be forced to buy coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LAW requiring electricity generators to use more coal is among the options
being considered by the government in its effort to keep open some of the 31
pits earmarked for closure.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, also said yesterday that
his department was studying cutting the price of British coal through
subsidies or further levies on consumers.
He told MPs that it was a 'genuinely open review' and that the government
had not reached views on any of the 15 areas for action which had been
identified by the review team. Many of the options, however, were subject to
European Community and international constraints.
Those constraints were highlighted yesterday when Mr Antonio Cardoso e
Cunha, the energy commissioner for the EC , told a parliamentary select
committee that the UK would have to reduce the nuclear levy, raised from
electricity consumers, if it wanted to subsidise coal.
Commission policy is that only 20 per cent of energy used to produce
electricity can be subsidised. In the UK all of this is taken up by the
nuclear industry. Although the levy on electricity bills is falling - the
surcharge on bills will be reduced from 11 per cent this year to 10 per cent
in 1993 - further action may be required if coal is subsidised.
Mr Heseltine's announcement suggests that none of the proposals made in
public to the trade and industry select committee has been ruled out
completely.
Mr Martin O'Neil, Labour's energy spokesman, said Mr Heseltine's 'dramatic
widening of the coal review' would make it 'even more difficult for him to
face down public opposition to his pit closure programme'.
Mr Heseltine's list included an investigation of the 'dash for gas',
suggesting that the government may scale back future generation plans and
review the operation of pricing formulae which critics say obscure judgment
of the real cost of gas.
He also referred to criticism of the electricity market after its
privatisation two years ago, saying there would be consultation with the
regulator about whether any company is abusing its market position. National
Power and PowerGen, the two generators in England and Wales, have been
accused of operating a duopoly to force up prices.
Other areas for investigation are:
Reducing the cost of coal production through changing working practices and
privatising pits;
Trade in coal, through increased exports of UK coal and import substitution,
and in electricity, through interconnectors with Scotland and France;
The impact of environmental commitments, including those relating to carbon
emissions and desulphurisation, and the development of opencast mining.

FT  09 DEC 92 / House scheme fails to benefit lenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSES REPOSSESSED by mortgage lenders accounted for only a tenth of the
properties bought by housing associations in the first week of the
government's Pounds 750m scheme to revive the housing market, it was
disclosed yesterday.
The poor initial result for building societies came in spite of their having
lobbied the government to encourage housing associations to buy repossessed
homes rather than unsold ones built by construction and property companies.
When the scheme was ann-ounced in the Autumn Statement by Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, he said it would reduce the overhang of empty properties by
more than 20,000 over the next few months, and provide 'a helpful stimulus
to activity'.
The first week's figures cover only 194 of the 16,000 homes to be bought in
England by next March. But societies said sales would continue to be
restricted by their statutory obligation to seek the highest price and by
the poor condition of many repossessed properties.
In the first week, the 27 associations selected by the Housing Corporation
to make bids applied for approval to buy 19 repossessions, 99 homes
completed by builders and developers, and 76 houses owned by individuals.
Mr Gregory Lomax, deputy chief executive of the corporation, the
government-funded agency which oversees housing associations in England,
said it was trying to encourage them to buy repossessed properties and homes
owned by individuals rather than relying on builders.
He said the corporation had retained 25 per cent of the Pounds 577m
provision for England to reward associations buying from sources other than
builders.
'We are trying to revive the housing market, not to revive the lenders. They
are important, but subsidiary,' he said. Mr Lomax said he expected lenders
to sell more houses through the scheme as they responded to associations'
requirements.
Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association, the association which has spent
its allocation in England the fastest, said it found societies 'slow on the
uptake' in providing lists of repossessions and responding to offers. The
association said it had already allocated all of its initial funding of
Pounds 3.7m in principle. About a quarter of the purchases were from
builders, a quarter from mortgage lenders and the remaining half from
private individuals.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
said many repossessed properties were not suitable for associations because
they were in bad condition.

FT  09 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Politicians never like to rock the boat. Because the government felt well
served by SG Warburg in the last BT sale, it is natural for it to pick the
same house to co-ordinate the next one. One wonders, though, how far the
Treasury has thought through the consequences. Intentionally or not, it is
building up Warburg at the expense of other UK houses which need a track
record in order to bid for the large equity issues that are becoming a
common feature of overseas privatisations. Ironically, foreign houses that
help with the international sales can put UK privatisation experience on
their CVs. As long as they are not part of the team, domestic houses cannot.

FT  09 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank may still be ahead of the game in spite of its 5 per cent fall
in operating profits at the 10-month stage. True, this stands in sharp
contrast to profits growth elsewhere in the sector and was sufficient to
send shares lower yesterday. But the impact of Deutsche's aggressive
expansion into east Germany is starting to fall away. Interest margins are
being squeezed as savers in the east switch into higher-yielding accounts.
Costs are also coming back under control now the task of building a branch
network is drawing to a close. Next year's figures should be less clouded.
Given the slide of west German industry into recession since the summer, the
market may by then be more concerned with asset quality than operating
profits.
By lending more in the interbank market rather than to its industrial and
commercial customers, Deutsche is already sacrificing lending margins in
favour of asset quality. By UK standards, the 1,000 job cuts next year
promised by Deutsche's Mr Hilmar Kopper hardly amount to digging in for the
long haul. Judged against the rosy optimism on the economy expressed by
Commerzbank last week, though, Deutsche is more alive to the risks of
recession.

FT  09 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Siebe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Siebe may have got to the point where it is difficult to squeeze much extra
margin from cost cutting. But since it has 45 per cent of its sales in the
US, this may not matter too much. A stronger dollar and the high operational
gearing at Foxboro should compound the impact of US economic recovery on its
earnings. On that basis, the upward trend which has seen the shares
outperform the market by nearly 40 per cent over the past year may have
further to run.
The higher Siebe's rating, though, the greater must be the temptation to
launch a rights issue and maybe another large acquisition. Siebe made it
clear yesterday that this was not part of its short-term plan. Indeed there
is no real urgency while debt is falling and interest is nearly four times
covered. But the first inklings of an ACT problem have appeared and gearing
would still be about 150 per cent were it not for Siebe's practice of
capitalising research and development expenditure.
A rights issue to finance a UK acquisition could solve both problems. This
need be not be negative for the shares as long as any acquisition is chosen
for real strategic value rather than mere financial convenience. Foxboro has
served the company well. Just the same, the uncertainty may at some point
damp the market's ardour.

FT  09 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Carlton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rehabilitation of Carlton Communications continues apace. Yesterday's 15
per cent annual profits improvement underpins the share price recovery that
has occurred over the past two years.
Carlton's troubles were never as dire as first depicted. In retrospect, its
problems stemmed more from a clumsy shift from first to second gear rather
than a slamming into reverse. Appropriately, for a company specialising in
visual entertainment, Carlton now offers highly visible earnings growth. The
video cassette division continues to grow strongly after a near-50 per cent
rise last year, while Carlton promises that a raft of new video equipment
will jolly profits along too. Carlton Television will start broadcasting
next month. Although it will hardly contribute in the current year, it may
add Pounds 20m to profits by 1994. Carlton should also benefit from a
currency kick this year which may enable it to surpass its historic profits
peak of Pounds 127m - even though earnings may not do the same until 1994.
That said, one wonders how deep the market's renewed love affair with
Carlton can be. Carlton's historic rating is now sandwiched between the
likes of Wellcome and Glaxo. Should the quality of earnings from Hollywood
be rated as highly as those derived from the frailties of human health?

FT  09 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: High stakes down under
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few doubt the wisdom of British Airways' expansion strategy, but some
shareholders may be feeling a touch nervous at the financial implications of
its aggression. As if TAT, Dan-Air and the mooted Dollars 750m (Pounds 490m)
stake in USAir were not enough, British Airways is also bidding to take a 25
per cent stake in Qantas, the Australian national carrier which is being
privatised next year.
The deal is far from done and BA will face strong competition from Singapore
Airlines and Air New Zealand. In order to secure the stake, BA may have to
put Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m on the table - although how quickly it would
have to pay it out is unclear. Any such outlay would take gearing close to
70 per cent, which surely begins to test the limits of financial tolerance.
BA would doubtless argue that opportunities to secure a foothold in the
lucrative Asia-Pacific market seldom arise. And the stock market's apparent
equanimity suggests shareholders may be ready to accept the argument.
Whether they would be willing to back it eventually with cash is an
altogether different matter. BA may be inclined to tough it out on the basis
that there is only likely to be one more poor quarter to come and that any
gearing up should only heighten its rebound. Alternatively, some form of
capital markets issue may provide a neat way of sidestepping the issue. Yet
perhaps BA would be privately relieved if one of its deals fell through.
Being the world's favourite airline can create its own dilemmas.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Letter: Clear need for institutional source of equity
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DONALD CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on the prospective demise of the unlisted securities market
('Going to market', December 1) makes the remarkably perceptive point that
an external source of equity capital is more important for British companies
than for their German counterparts.
Remarkable because this basic fact of British economic life seems to be so
little understood.
The difficulties faced by companies needing the oxygen of base capital at a
time when they are stifled by excessively large and expensive amounts of
debt point to the need for a permanently available institutional source of
equity capital. It is inevitable that such capital will become more scarce
and expensive as the liquidity of the secondary market declines, however
easy it may be in times of booming corporate profits and investor demand.
There is thus a clear need for an institution capable of providing equity
capital to private companies in all economic weathers. It must be able to
acquire inexpensively, and hold indefinitely, equity stakes which provide
its own shareholders with little short-term income, but with the
compensation of long-term capital growth.
I could, if you like, suggest a name for the proposed institution,

If public relations is all about winning friends and influencing people,
then the small London PR outfit Rostron Parry may well be approaching its
profession the wrong way.
Its invitation certainly stands out from the general run as the Christmas
party announcements roll in. Rostron Parry takes 'great pleasure' in
inviting Observer to lunch . . . then asks for a cheque for Pounds 14 to
cover food and 'a reasonable amount of drink'.
Can times be so hard that even journalists are expected to pay their own
way?

When is a professor not a professor?
The question has been posed by some churlish individuals who have noted that
members of the Treasury's new private-sector forecasting panel who are
listed as professors include Tim Congdon.
While Wynne Godley, David Currie and Patrick Minford are full-time
university types, consultancy-owner Congdon is a mere honorary professor of
economics at Cardiff Business School. Usually, honorary profs tend to call
themselves plain mister when outside the university that so honoured them.
Perhaps the reason is that, for career academics, a professorship generally
takes much time and achievement to acquire. Moreover, even when they've won
it, most earn a relative pittance compared with some of their honorary
colleagues.
Whatever the latters' rights to the title, their use of it in public smacks
of gilding the lily.

<TEXT>
A black day for Transport Minister Steven Norris and his official re-opening
of London's Victoria coach station, restyled and fitted with all kinds of
high-tech gadgetry at a cost of Pounds 4m.
For one thing, his mother - a regular coach-traveller - had bowled down from
Nottingham to see him perform. But he, coming only a mile or so from the
Transport Department's headquarters, got held up by heavy traffic and was 20
minutes late.
What's more, even when he arrived, there was no lighting, no heating,
nothing on the new passenger-information screens, and no computer
ticket-dispensers at work. Thanks to a local power failure, Britain's
busiest coach station - with 160,000 comings and goings a year - was blacked
out.
So he took his mother on a tour of the gloomy complex, sporadically
enthusing about how excellent the improvements would be when they worked.
And at least there were some real-life passengers to see, awaiting their
departures in the dark.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While parliament quibbles over who should pay for restoring the burnt-out
ruins of Windsor Castle, MPs might give a little thought to their own fire
precautions.
According to today's report on same from the National Audit Office, the
Palace of Westminster has been without a fire certificate since 1979 when an
inspection declared the provisions inadequate. It could be as long as three
years before the Home Office Fire Service Inspectorate is able to issue new
documentary approval.
As if that were not bad enough, the Treasury also lacks a fire certificate.
Several departments share the Great George Street building, and there was
apparently confusion over which of them was responsible for making the
application.
Officials say they're looking forward to receiving the necessary paper any
day. But given the record of Treasury forecasters, it would probably be wise
to pack a wet blanket in your briefcase when going to 1 Great George Street
. . . especially if visiting permanent secretary Sir Terry Burns.

<TEXT>
Fancy a flutter? If so, you might try one of the Russian commemorative coins
just unveiled in the former Soviet embassy in what was East Berlin, with a
view to netting D-Marks by the million for Moscow's hard-up treasury.
Although introduced by a Russian mint official called Vladlen Antipov, whose
first name is shorthand for Vladimir Lenin, the coins bear the old Tsarist
insignia of the double-headed eagle. 'It is our new national emblem,' he
said.
True, he went on, there was the little local difficulty of the latest
Peoples' Congress failing to approve the new national arms. But it had not
definitively rejected them either. 'We give no guarantees, but I think more
deputies are for the eagle than against.'
Whereupon up popped Russian diplomat Vladimir Polenov with an
entrepreneurial twist. If the Peoples' Congress did give the bird to the
eagle, the value of the coins could soar by a hundredfold, he thought.
Beaming, Antipov followed up by naming a likely best buy for German
collectors, who for 'historical reasons' tend to take up three-fifths of the
commemorative coins issued by the Moscow mint.
On the obverse side from the eagle, he said, the Rbs25 specimen in palladium
bore a smiling Catherine the Great, German-born and an enlightened despot to
boot. Just the thing for a Christmas present at DM650 a throw.

<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Mark Hull (Letters, December 4) suggests that 30 years ago building
societies borrowed money at 4 per cent and lent it at 5 per cent, whereas
now there is a 3 percentage point spread.
In 1962, the average rate of interest paid on building society shares was
3.7 per cent which, after payment of tax by the building society, equated to
a gross cost of 4.46 per cent. The average rate of interest charged on
mortgages was 6.61 per cent, a margin of 2.15 per cent.
In the first half of 1992, the average cost of shares was 9.04 per cent and
the average rate charged on mortgages was 10.9 per cent, a smaller margin at
1.86 per cent.
Mr Hull would like a 1 percentage point spread and his manager on the golf
course at 3 o'clock. Sadly, neither is attainable at present.
A 1 percentage point spread might just be sufficient to cover the management
adequacy of a society. However, it would be insufficient to meet rigorous
capital adequacy requirements, especially bearing in mind the effect of the
recession on bad debts provisions.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Letter: Mistrust and angst behind Swiss rejection of EEA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BIJAN-DANIEL KHEZRI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial on Switzerland's rejection of the European Economic Area
('A shot across the EC's bows,' December 7) rightly states that the larger
question at stake is the very future of the Swiss political system.
Close analysis of the Swiss discussion on the EEA, particularly in
German-speaking Switzerland, further suggests the following:
Communication between the political and business elite on the one side and
the public on the other broke down completely. As you stated: 'The people
trusted their instincts more than their leaders.' Misinformation, largely
circulated through privately sponsored advertisements in the local press,
dominated the scene. Europe's political class and business leaders have
failed to make the (so far diffuse) notion of subsidiarity and
supranationality accessible to the public in a time of changing values and
ever increasing political and economic transnational interdependence.
Swiss rejection of the EEA is principally a rejection of the majority
Germany-speaking Switzerland, where discussion had little to do with Europe
itself, but was a reflection of a deeply rooted angst of losing one's very
specific cultural identity. Swiss rejection of the EEA runs smack into
constitutional realities. It raises the question whether Swiss direct
democracy is practical at a time when long-term structural decisions have to
be taken which simply surpass the comprehensive capabilities of the average
masses.

Sir, The wanton act of destruction at Ayodhya on Sunday will remain as a
dark moment in India's history. All right thinking Indians must feel a great
sense of loss.
Our independence was won through non-violence. As the world's largest
democracy India has built an international reputation as being a secular
nation where all religions have co-existed peacefully. It is therefore
unforgivable that political parties can consciously fan religious fanaticism
and hatred to serve their own selfish political ends.
The time has come for the people of India to stand up against these divisive
forces by fighting communalism and hatred. We should instead all work
together to strengthen our common bond of units - we are all Indians. Let us
not destroy our heritage.

on asylum may force refugees to countries least able to support them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
At European Community summits many statements are issued. Only a few are
seriously discussed. One statement which this week's Edinburgh summit can be
relied on to nod through is a 'declaration on principles governing external
aspects of migration policy', proposed by the British presidency.
While welcoming the 'greater ease of travel and contacts throughout Europe'
allowed by the collapse of communism, the summiteers will express their
concern that 'uncontrolled immigration could be destabilising and could
undermine the situation of third country nationals who have legally taken up
residence in the member states'. And they will go on to list the factors
they think could help reduce migration: 'the preservation of peace and the
termination of armed conflicts; full respect for human rights, including
respect for minority rights; the creation of democratic societies and
adequate social conditions; a liberal trade policy, which should improve
economic conditions in the countries of migration; and co-ordination of
action in the fields of foreign policy, economic co-operation and
immigration and asylum policy'.
If that is to be taken as a list of devout Christmas wishes, it borders on
the platitudinous. If it is a list of New Year resolutions on which the EC's
member states intend to act it is laudable, but strains credulity. They
hardly have the power to create democracy, let alone adequate social
conditions, beyond their own borders. They apparently lack the power, or
anyway the will-power, to preserve peace and terminate armed conflicts. They
have done a bit, but hardly enough, to encourage respect for human and
minority rights. They presumably do have the power to adopt a liberal trade
policy, but seem disinclined to exercise that power when dealing with goods
that 'countries of migration' can actually produce at competitive prices
such as steel.
That leaves 'co-ordination of action', notably in the field of immigration
and asylum policy. Here the member states have indeed been busy, although
they remain strangely coy about the details of what they have been up to.
Last week the ministers with responsibility for immigration matters met in
London under the chairmanship of the British home secretary, Mr Kenneth
Clarke. They did issue a press release listing the recommendations they had
approved and the resolutions they adopted, but the texts of these documents
were not made public.
If it were up to the British government the texts would no doubt still be
shrouded in that cloak of secrecy with which it instinctively surrounds all
its activities when not positively obliged to disclose them. Mr Clarke, for
instance, had nothing to say about his deliberations with his European
colleagues when he appeared the next day before the House of Commons
committee considering Britain's own national Asylum Bill.
One might think - indeed some MPs did think - that the former would have
some bearing on the latter. But apparently it is none of their business.
Luckily the Dutch government is rather less secretive. And so the texts of
last week's resolutions soon became available to British non-governmental
organisations and journalists.
One of those resolutions, calling for an 'accelerated procedure' to deal
with 'manifestly unfounded applications for asylum', was referred to in this
column on October 28. I am happy to report that some of the more offensive
language I quoted then from the original British draft, advising refugees to
stay in their own countries or continents, has disappeared. And the overall
objective, to speed up the processing of applications in the interest of
genuine refugees as well as that of host country, is reasonable enough.
But the resolution does not suggest that other EC countries should follow
the Dutch example of speeding up the process by offering applicants free
legal aid. Instead it introduces the notion of the 'host third country',
defined at some length in an accompanying resolution, but meaning in essence
a country outside the Community - other than the refugee's own - from which
he (or she) has come and to which he (or she) can be sent back.
Did I say 'can'? It is actually more like 'must'. Although there is a
let-out clause under which 'any member state retains the right, for
humanitarian reasons, not to remove the asylum applicant to a host third
country', any state which exercises that right in more than a handful of
cases will clearly be letting the side down, since 'the principle of the
host third country is to be applied to all applicants for asylum,
irrespective of whether they may be regarded as refugees', and 'thus, if
there is a host third country, the application for refugee status may not be
examined and the asylum applicant may be sent to that country.'
In short, the object of the resolution is to make sure that refugees are
sent back to the first 'safe' country they were able to reach. It
complements the Dublin Convention, signed in 1990, under which member states
agreed that asylum applications should be dealt with by the first EC country
in which the applicant had arrived.
Although, as of last week, only four states had got round to ratifying this
convention, Britain has been making vigorous use of it. A verb 'to Dublin'
has even been coined to describe the action of sending someone back to, say,
Belgium on the grounds that he spent a night in Brussels airport before
reaching Britain.
Britain is the main beneficiary of these arrangements. Few people will be
'Dublined' to Britain, since few refugees will pass through Britain on their
way to other EC states. The UK has placed itself at the hub of two
concentric circles of selfishness. It can send people back to other EC
countries, and now all EC countries will be expected to send them back to
'host third countries'.
Which will those host third countries be? All too often the central European
ones closest to the horrors that people are fleeing from, and most in danger
of being sucked into those horrors themselves: Macedonia, Croatia, Slovenia,
Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics, Poland. All those countries, in the
midst of their own desperately difficult transition to democracy and the
market, are struggling to cope with great flows of refugees and migrants,
and have neither the institutions nor the resources to cope with them.
To qualify as a host third country, you must not threaten the life or
freedom of the applicant, or subject him to torture or inhuman or degrading
treatment, or send him back to the country whose persecution he originally
sought to escape. As soon as you pass this test, your reward is to be
expected to keep all the refugees that arrive on your own territory, and to
accept back all those that have tried to move on to more prosperous and
stable countries, which one might think better equipped to look after them.
Is it by this obscene game of pass-the-human-parcel that west European
leaders believe they will encourage 'full respect for human rights' and 'the
creation of democratic societies and adequate social conditions'?

FT  09 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Air waves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE IS flying through fog in its search for a system of airline
regulation which yields greater competitive pressures and a better deal for
consumers.
The latest leg of this troubled journey ended in the small hours of
yesterday morning, when EC transport ministers agreed a new regulation
governing the allocation of airport take-off and landing slots. It says that
in future airlines which do not use their slots will lose them and that when
slots do become available, preference will be given to airlines which lack a
significant presence at the airport system in question. It also gives
governments the power to take the task of co-ordinating slot allocation away
from the big airlines, although it may be doubted whether many of them will
use it.
This is presented by Mr John MacGregor, the UK Transport Secretary, as a
breakthrough: 'a regulation which protects the legitimate rights of
established carriers, while allowing new carriers onto routes and
stimulating competition.'
Some newer carriers do not agree. They think that once again EC transport
ministers have done what their big flag carriers want, namely to keep the
competition at bay. According to these smaller airlines, 'use it or lose it'
is a rule the big carriers will be happy to live by. It is, after all, not
difficult for a big airline to maintain an adequate presence even on a
loss-making route if it knows that the alternative is withdrawal leading to
a price war and the emergence of serious competition.
The smaller carriers also ask: does the regulation mean that airlines which
do use their slots thereby in effect acquire the right to go on using them
in perpetuity, which would amount to a property right? And they wonder to
what extent national regulatory bodies, such as Britain's Civil Aviation
Authority, will be further hindered in their ability to coerce bigger
carriers into releasing slots to smaller carriers by the appearance of an
apparently more liberal new regime. These are good questions, to which
ministers should provide answers before formally approving the regulation
agreed in outline yesterday.
All of this is perplexing for European air passengers, who are confronted
daily with overpriced services. Those who think that even under the new
rules, the airport slot allocation system will still be dominated by the big
airlines for their own benefit will continue the quest for a more liberal
alternative based upon some kind of rolling franchise system.
Probably the best that can be said for yesterday's agreement is that it
gives the European Commission power to intervene in the airlines' slot
allocation committees, if the policy of easing the way for smaller airlines
appears not to be working. The regulation also contains a clear review
clause. These are powers the commission will need to use with skill and
determination.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Gambler eyes his crowning glory: Francois Mitterrand is
determined that Maastricht will be ratified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the ornate objects lining the presidential chamber in the Elysee, a
sculpture of Time's Winged Chariot would not now be completely out of place.
For at 76, and not in the best of health, Francois Mitterrand knows he does
not have much time if he is to save what he regards as his final and
crowning European achievement - the Maastricht treaty on European union.
The next few days will be crucial. When he takes his place as the senior
statesman at the Edinburgh summit on Friday, the French president will be
fighting for Maastricht's survival in the face of monetary disorder,
political disarray and doubts as to whether two countries - Denmark and
Britain - will ever ratify the European pact.
If there are any doubts that salvaging the treaty is at the heart of this
weekend's deliberations, Mr Mitterrand is determined to lay them to rest.
Looking pale but resolute, he says Maastricht remains the only route-map to
European integration, and he will brook no alternative. It can be neither
renegotiated for the 12 nor watered down for individual members, he insists.
By the end of this year, 10 EC states will have ratified it, and if Denmark
and/or Britain fail to do so, the others will proceed regardless.
'We cannot make an agreement minus a single currency, minus the central
bank, minus a common foreign policy. . . . Rejection (of Maastricht) by the
countries in question (Denmark and Britain) would not stop the construction
of Europe,' he insists. Maastricht, he claims, could be legally adapted to a
smaller number of countries.
Mr Mitterrand's summit partners will find him at Edinburgh returning to the
tough line he took in the immediate after-shock of the Danish referendum
which rejected the treaty last June. In effect, he is staking all on
European union - looking to the European stage for success that, with his
Socialist party almost certain to be defeated in next March's parliamentary
elections, he can no longer hope for at home.
A passion for European integration is the one consistent theme in the
president's long and tortuous political career, stretching back to his
experience as a German prisoner in the second world war. The likely advent
of a centre-right government in France next spring will mean he will be less
involved in domestic affairs. But he will still be able to determine the
overall thrust of policy by helping lock France, and others, into
Maastricht. He has recently proposed a series of constitutional reforms; but
they are mainly designed to strengthen the parliament at the expense of the
government, and nothing in them would diminish his presidential prerogative
in foreign policy.
Is Mr Mitterrand bluffing in warning that the rest of Europe could leave
Britain and Denmark? Certainly, he is a gambler who has shown himself to
play for high political stakes against uncertain odds. He refuses to admit
any tactical error in putting Maastricht to a referendum in his own country.
He brushes aside observations that the very strong showing of Maastricht's
opponents in the French referendum campaign helped destabilise the European
Monetary System. It was, he says, 'a very fine campaign' because Maastricht
jolted Frenchmen and women out of their indifference to referenda of recent
years, providing a turnout of more than 70 per cent.
Just how much of a chance he consciously took, he is only now prepared to
spell out. 'Ask my staff and they will tell you that I never expected more
than 52 per cent (approval).' His EC counterparts would have trembled had
they known how fine his calculation was.
In the end, it was a 51.4 per cent approval for Maastricht. And the margin
of victory was bigger than that by which John Kennedy beat Richard Nixon,
says the president, as though 1960 was yesterday. More to the immediate
point, he notes that it was a bigger margin than that by which Maastricht
failed in the Danish referendum. Yet, Mr Mitterrand, whose own rating has
touched all-time lows for Fifth Republic presidents, knows better than
anyone the fickleness of public opinion. That seems to be why he appears so
anxious to avoid the impact on a still-undecided Britain of a second, and
possibly again negative, referendum in Denmark.
There is a clear distinction in the way the president talks about Denmark
and Britain. He is readier to discuss a European Union without Denmark.
'There would be no reason to displace it (Denmark), though once Maastricht
enters into force, there will be a disparate situation which will require
some changes.' But, beyond general warnings that laggards get left behind in
European integration, he is deeply reluctant to enter into the specifics of
Maastricht-without-Britain. 'I do not despair at all that Britain will
adhere to the treaty which the head of its government has signed.'
He refuses to join in the widespread criticism of the UK presidency. Indeed,
he says Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, his trade minister, 'went too far' in
describing Britain's handling of EC business as calamitous. But the
president is implacable on one point: John Major would be making a serious
mistake if he delayed completing UK ratification until after a second Danish
referendum. This is precisely what Mr Major promised potential backbench
rebels in order to win his Maastricht vote in the House of Commons last
month. 'British policy should not be put in tow to Danish policy,' Mr
Mitterrand says, adding with ill-concealed disdain: 'I don't see how Great
Britain can allow its decision to be made in another country.'
There are many who now argue that the Community's present disarray stems not
from bad faith of individual governments, but from inherent flaws in the
Maastricht treaty. Mr Mitterrand will have none of this. 'Europe has not
broken down,' he flatly asserts. The treaty flowed logically, he argues,
from the Single European Act, negotiated in 1985, which set in place the
single market. 'Maastricht is designed precisely to ensure that this free
market is not simply anarchy.' For example, he sees Maastricht as an overdue
treaty of protection in that it provides for police co-operation in a
frontier-free Europe. Without such provisions, he said, you would have a
Europe 'open to all winds'.
But surely the treaty's core provisions on economic and monetary union (Emu)
now seem too ambitious and too rushed? Nonsense, the French president says.
'We needed a fairly rigorous convention (on Emu), and I repeat that 10 out
of 12 countries have imposed this discipline on themselves. . . . The more
it would have been delayed, the less it would have worked.'
Mr Mitterrand has had sharp reminders in recent weeks of how true this is,
as market doubts about the feasibility of Emu have even shaken, though not
broken, the parity link between the franc and the D-Mark within the exchange
rate mechanism of the EMS. But the president grandly dismisses the views of
the money-changers. 'Speculation (against the franc) does not exploit
doubts, it creates doubts.'
The president affirms, with some justice, that 'the French economy is the
best in Europe at the moment', and says that 'devaluation is never
considered a good policy'. He is open to, though not yet convinced of, the
idea of narrowing further the limits within which the franc can fluctuate
against the D-Mark. It is 'for discussion', he says.
In this area, too, all other considerations are subordinate to Maastricht's
economic disciplines. France's persistently high unemployment rate - itself
partly a side-effect of the franc fort policy - is 'quite dramatic', the
president concedes. But it is a 'social problem', he says, and, by
implication, a problem of second order. He points out that joblessness has
risen faster in Germany and Britain over the past year than in France.
If there are particular doubts about France's strong exchange rate policy
and commitment to continuing disinflation, it is because its Socialist
government faces the voters in March. But Mr Mitterrand insists that this
fact, too, will not stampede it into changing course. 'This government will
maintain exactly the same economic attitude which it has had since the
start.' No one is better placed than the French president to persuade Bonn
of Europe's need for lower German interests.
Mr Mitterrand says he raises the issue constantly in his talks with
Chancellor Kohl. 'But I respect their policy because I know they have
pressing (budgetary) obligations which are very heavy.'
Mr Mitterrand's sense of urgency concerning the need for Europe to progress
is nowhere more evident than in his new-found openness to new EC members.
France used to be very insistent on the Community getting its house in order
before admitting new members. Earlier this year, it was still demanding that
formal enlargement negotiations with the countries of the European Free
Trade Association (Efta) could not begin until Maastricht was universally
ratified and future EC financing decided. Mr Mitterrand now blurs these
pre-conditions, and has no difficulty in joining Germany and Britain in
calling for accelerated talks with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway - but
not now Switzerland - to be wrapped up by the end of 1993.
The desire of the first three of these countries to marry EC membership with
their long-standing neutrality will be the main negotiating issue. 'That
(neutrality) is a problem for them, not for us,' says Mr Mitterrand. Neutral
countries should not be allowed to thwart the Community's efforts to project
a more forceful role in the world, though the president concedes that
existing EC states have done just that in the case of the former Yugoslavia.
As with Efta, so with the lengthening queue of would-be EC members in
eastern Europe. Once a proponent of deepening - as opposed to widening  -
the Community, Mr Mitterrand has now come around to a very broad view of
Europe potentially encompassing any democratic state on the continent with a
sufficiently strong economy. The Balkans and the Baltic states? Russia and
the Ukraine? 'Why not?,' he asks. Here, his vision of a future Europe
stretches even further than that of Mr Kohl.
How could such a diverse membership be accommodated in a Community based on
the Maastricht treaty? That is a long term question that Mr Mitterrand is
happy to leave to his successors. For the moment, the job in hand is
ratifying Maastricht, and Mr Mitterrand insists he is fit for the task.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Ukraine's chance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE politics appears to be halting Russia's move toward a market economy,
in Ukraine the transition has finally begun. If the words of Mr Leonid
Kuchma, Ukraine's new and reform-minded prime minister, can be translated
into actions then even cynical western observers have reason for modest
optimism.
The economic challenge facing the former Soviet Union's second largest
republic is immense. Mr Kuchma's task is first to repair the damage of years
of stagnation and mismanagement which, until recently, President Leonid
Kravchuk has appeared willing to tolerate. Increasingly irresponsible
government has left Ukraine with a budget deficit greater than a third of
the economy, an inflation rate of more than 30 per cent a month and a
quasi-currency, the coupon, which commands little respect from those forced
to use it.
Yet a market-oriented Ukrainian government could find an escape from looming
hyperinflation. Mr Kuchma, a reform-minded former rocket factory director,
is potentially able to command support from a wide coalition of interests.
He has been granted wide-ranging executive powers by parliament. He also has
much greater control over local officials than do his counterparts in
Moscow.
Moreover the past year's inaction allows Ukraine, and its western advisers,
to learn from Russia's mistakes. Whether Mr Kuchma can succeed where Mr
Gaidar has so far failed depends on whether they draw the correct
conclusions. Ukraine must move faster not slower - those siren voices
calling for a gradualist approach must be ignored. But it must move across a
wider reform agenda than the Russian government has tackled so far.
Ukraine's first priority is to curb inflation. It must stop net credit
creation by the central bank and cut deep into the government subsidies
which are responsible for the huge budget deficit. But an IMF-style
stabilisation programme has no chance of success unless accompanied by
measures to encourage private economic activity.
The government should end monopolistic state orders; auction state owned
trucks to permit goods to be brought to cities; announce a tax holiday and
automatic registration for new small businesses; and organise small-scale
privatisation auctions. Only then might stabilisation be sustainable.
Ukraine cannot succeed without western aid to finance imports and help fund
the budget deficit, preferably in return for decommissioning its nuclear
weapons and dangerous nuclear power plants. The aid needs to be conditional
on structural reform as well as macroeconomic targets; and should follow
tangible steps towards stabilisation and liberalisation.
At least the talk in Kiev is now encouraging. But only action can prove the
sincerity of the government's words.

<TEXT>
The UK's decision to postpone the parliamentary vote on the Maastricht
treaty makes this week's Edinburgh summit an important occasion for
examining how other EC members interpret the proposed agreement.
A good starting point would be the EC reaction to Denmark's decision not to
ratify the Maastricht plan. Although the Treaty of Rome - which created the
European Community - explicitly provides that all treaty revisions must be
unanimous, some continental politicians now assert that Denmark does not
have the right to block the treaty revision proposed at Maastricht. Denmark
should therefore be forced to leave the EC if it does not accept Maastricht,
they say.
If Britain decides not to ratify the treaty, or rejects some future proposed
treaty revisions, would it be forced to leave the Community?
Edinburgh provides the opportunity to reconfirm that, even if Britain does
ratify the treaty, it not only has the legal right to maintain its own
currency, but could expect to do so without penalties or recriminations.
That is important because the benefits of participating in monetary union
would be outweighed by the adverse effects on UK unemployment and inflation.
A single currency would simplify UK business dealings within the EC. But
such gains are small in comparison with the higher average cyclical
unemployment in Britain that would result from the loss of a national
monetary policy and of a currency that responds to market forces to maintain
competitiveness. And contrary to the claim of the European Commission, there
is neither evidence nor logic to suggest that a single currency is needed to
benefit from the trade gains of a single European market.
Despite talk of an independent European central bank committed to price
stability, Maastricht gives the Council of Ministers the power to tell the
proposed central bank how to manage the external value of the common
European currency and thus the power to set a more-or-less inflationary
monetary policy for Europe as a whole. Is that what President Mitterrand
meant when he told the French public that European monetary policy would be
determined by politicians and not by central bankers?
The political consequences of the Maastricht treaty would be even more
important than its economic effects. Maastricht anticipates that all
decisions about foreign policy and military actions would eventually be made
at the Community level. The Edinburgh summit might clarify what would happen
if Britain did not want to participate in some future military action. Could
Brussels nevertheless conscript British subjects to fight in a war?
Brussels has come under strong criticism for excessive involvement in the
domestic matters of member states. Subsequent assertions by the Commission
that Brussels would in the future be more accountable to the elected members
of the European Parliament did little to reassure those people who were
concerned about losing national self-determination.
The principle of subsidiarity - assigning decisions to the lowest
appropriate level of government - has therefore been emphasised in an
attempt to reassure people that they and their national governments will not
lose control over important issues. There is, however, so little practical
content to the idea of subsidiarity that it cannot provide comfort to anyone
who worries about a European federal government's assumption of authority
for rules affecting local lifestyles and national fiscal policies.
As an American, I am accustomed to the drift of authority from state
governments to Washington. Despite the US Constitution's unambiguous 10th
Amendment (which reserves to the individual states all powers not
specifically vested by the Constitution itself in the central government),
Washington now determines things such as the maximum speed limit on state
roads and the minimum age at which people can purchase beer.
The issue of subsidiarity involves domestic fiscal policy as well as
personal lifestyle issues. The original Delors plan for the Maastricht
treaty would have constrained national budget deficits. National tax
authorities are already restructuring value added taxes to conform to
European guidelines. Although the EC has little revenue of its own, is there
anything in the treaty to stop a flow of fiscal power and resources to the
centre if a European majority wants to do so?
The ultimate protection of national sovereignty is the right to withdraw
from the EC. It is significant therefore that the Community treaties contain
no provision for unilateral withdrawal. What would happen if a country felt
that its national interest and way of life were so threatened by the rules
of a centralised European government that it wanted to leave? Could it be
compelled by force to remain?
These questions are as difficult as they are important. The success of the
Edinburgh meeting will be measured by the extent to which it provides clear
answers.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Leading Article: The threat to India
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA HAS experienced a nasty shock, but it can recover. The destruction of
the mosque at Ayodhya by Hindu militants on Sunday night has outraged
Moslems everywhere. The erection of a makeshift Hindu temple in its place
has compounded the damage. The fierce religious passions that have been
unleashed by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) threaten the
stability of the sub-continent. The focus has naturally been on the past two
days of rioting; by last night the death toll had reached 400.
Yet India has survived events of similar dramatic impact, including the
assassinations of Mahatma Gandhi by Hindu activists, Nehru's daughter Mrs
Indira Gandhi by Sikhs, and her son Rajiv by Tamils. Moslems have long been
in conflict with the Indian state in Kashmir, as have Sikh terrorists in
Punjab. The republic has been subjected to religious and sectarian disputes
since the great partition of 1947. The birth of modern India and Pakistan
was marked by bloody internal conflicts; there have since been two wars
between them. A state that can survive all that during its first
half-century of independent existence will not easily be driven to
self-destruction.
The urgent task for the Indian government now is to re-establish order. This
would best be achieved by the continuance in office of the prime minister,
Mr PV Narasimha Rao. Mr Rao's policy of appeasing the BJP, particularly
during the early months of his initially shaky government, was one of the
errors that led to the disaster at Ayodhya. But a change of government would
not necessarily lead to greater stability. In July Mr Rao tried to deflect
the BJP's campaign against the mosque by referring it to the Supreme Court.
Now he has the chance to act with greater force.
He has begun to do so. The site around the Ayodhya mosque/temple has been
cleared of 50,000 militants, with no casualties. There is a delicate
tactical problem to settle here. Delhi is pledged to restore the mosque, but
if it dismantles the makeshift temple, now widely regarded as a holy place,
it may alienate moderate Hindus. The ideal solution, the building of a
shrine to each religion, side by side, and the dedication of the site to
national reconciliation, may be unreachable.
Leaders of the BJP and allied organisations have been arrested and charged
with inciting violence. This is a calculated risk by Mr Rao's
administration. It might further inflame militant Hindus, but, against that,
virtually the entire Indian press has come out against the destruction of
the Ayodhya mosque. Moderate Hindus are appalled; the flirtation of some of
them with the BJP, an upper-caste led party, may be over. Thus strengthened,
Mr Rao stands a chance of reasserting the government's authority and
concentrating on his programme for economic liberalisation. Success in that
endeavour is a prerequisite if modern India is to survive. Mr Rao has shown
courage on the economic front; he must now act to restore India's tradition
of religious tolerance.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Arts: Catering for closing time on the commercial channels -
Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most extraordinary hour in the week's television now occurs on the
commercial channels at pub closing time on Fridays, especially in London and
the remote Scottish islands. Channel 4 provides The Word, which can be seen
anywhere in Britain, and London Weekend offers Dial Midnight which is shown
in the metropolis and in the Grampian region of northern Scotland. The Word
is a yoof show, its title presumably ironic since its young cockney male
presenters have remarkably limited vocabularies. The young female presenters
tend, like Madonna, to make underwear the focal point of their outfits:
black lace bra under transparent blouse, stockings which end below the hem
of the miniskirt, and so on. It is like a meeting between The Bash Street
Kids and the girls of St Trinian's. Rap, pop and fame are the subjects.
The presenters on Dial Midnight, two anorexic looking girls and the
ebullient James Whale (who converted his Midlands radio show into a late
night Midlands television show before making this move to London) sit on
what appears to be a red rubber hedgehog and discuss the sort of subjects
which you find at the extreme edge of the tabloid market: penis enhancement
operations, faith healing, and so on. Last Friday they boasted television's
first drag-queen tele-dating session. Danny, dressed in black lingerie and
high heeled black patent boots, took phone calls from viewers, asking 'How
big is your dick?' and so on, and made a date with one of them. It all looks
astoundingly cheap and the sensationalism may pull in a hefty post-pub,
post-club audience. But is this really the way that British commercial
television intends to make the bigger profits which the new government rules
apparently intend?
Last month this column characterised much of television's drama output as
Marks and Spencer material (middle of the market, good value for money, but
desperately safe and derivitive), so it should now be acknowledged that we
have recently been treated to two superior and original drama productions,
both on BBC1. The 13-part series about a police investigation unit, Between
The Lines, fulfilled its early promise, developed three unusually
interesting characters at its centre, and vividly illustrated the
difficulties of fighting the unprincipled with principles. It fully merits
another series and is getting one. Look At It This Way, a three-part
adaptation by Justin Cartwright from his own novel, was a nicely
idiosyncratic mix of crime, romance, and satire, using cities in general and
London in particular as a sub text, and a visually powerful one.
On the other hand ITV's new Sunday evening series A Touch Of Frost, with
David Jason playing yet another police detective, looks like a classic Marks
and Sparks production. It is well made - though the opening story was not
too clever - and will doubtless please many and offend few. But do we really
need yet another one?
On Monday Panorama finally presented an honest programme about 'Satanic
abuse', showing that, whatever those ludicrous ooky-spooky documentaries on
Channel 4 may have pretended, there is no evidence whatsoever to prove the
existence of this phenomenon which stems from an obsession among American
Christian fundamentalists. Producer Nawinder Minhas and reporter Martin
Bashir deserve the thanks of everyone, especially those whose children have
been taken away by social services departments and put through the
astonishing sort of third degree demonstrated on this programme.
Which current affairs series will have the courage to make a similarly
honest programme about AIDS to be shown in Britain in peak time on a major
network? It will, of course, cause the most almighty row. In the ten years
since the first public acknowledgement of the disease, enormous efforts have
been made to frighten ordinary heterosexuals into altering their habits,
rather than focussing on promiscuous male homosexuals, bisexuals, drug
abusers or those from parts of Africa as 'high risk' groups. In the age of
political correctness it seems that television journalists would rather risk
misleading the public than being called homophobes or racists.
Last week being AIDS Awareness Week, this serious lack of balance was much
in evidence. We were repeatedly told that in Britain the fastest increase in
AIDS cases in the past year was among women, but none of the speakers
mentioned the fact that for women the numbers are counted in tens but for
men in thousands. In all the years of AIDS programmes, I know of only three
which were completely honest and open. The first, made by Fisher Dilke for
Horizon in 1986, tried to establish exactly what it was about homosexual
behaviour which produced a high incidence of the disease. The BBC suppressed
it. The other two, made by Joan Shenton, were bravely non-conformist and
questioned some of the widespread assumptions about AIDS and HIV. But having
been shown on Channel 4, they will not have reached a big audience.
Last week's programmes were typified by the sight of comedienne Ruby Wax
wagging her finger at us and telling us that heterosexuals must wear
condoms. You might think that the duty of a self respecting current affairs
department was to try to explain to us the difference between AIDS in
Britain and in sub-Saharan Africa. Does the high rate of heterosexual AIDS
in Africa result from needle-sharing in under-funded clinics? From
transmission linked to other venereal infections? From the widespread use of
anal intercourse as a contraceptive measure? Medical journals discuss these
factors, but television programmes prefer to suggest uncritically that since
AIDS is a heterosexual disease in Africa, the same must be true in Britain,
despite the differences. This is another example of a subject on which the
public has been better served by the press. If television continues to
suppress facts and to follow its own tunnel vision down the politically
correct line while newspapers continue to report a broader spectrum of fact
and opinion, television's credibility in current affairs will suffer.
The increasing specialisation in the television awards business is getting
out of hand. On Monday of last week Sky One brought us two and a half hours
of the BAFTA Advertising Awards, compered by David Frost, then on Saturday
ITV gave us two hours of The British Comedy Awards compered by Jonathan
Ross. These are both new occasions to be added to the Emmys, Oscars and
BAFTA Awards, the BFI Awards (with their leaning towards film), and the RTS
Awards (journalism), not to mention the craft awards, awards for rock
videos, and so on. Soon there will be enough to make it a regular monthly
occasion, and at that point the logical step will surely be an Award of
Awards, offering a single prize for the year's best actor, actress, comedy,
documentary . . . and of course best awards evening.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Arts: Purcell's 'Dido and Aeneas' - Concert and semi-staged
opera performances at the Barbican and Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An instrumental prelude led into the Prologue. This turned out to be a
pageant of the sea, an allegory in the French style, featuring Phoebus
attired in gold with a richly plumed headdress, Venus, nymphs and shepherds,
the men in this stylishly costumed production all looking the spitting image
of Charles II.
For those who had not read the small print, the identity of the opera would
be a mystery. Surviving copies of the text for Purcell's Dido and Aeneas
show that at some point it acquired a prologue, but the music is lost and
the opera has become known without it. In this staged performance at the
Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday the English Bach Festival tried a
re-construction: other short pieces by Purcell were interspersed throughout
the verses, which were spoken.
As a one-off exercise, it had its value. Assuming Purcell ever did write the
music to go with this opening, the drama would have taken on a wider
significance in the person of the goddess of love, representing all the
Didos of the human race. No doubt the score would also have brought a deeper
resonance to her utterances - but without the music, we just do not know.
It was telling how the performance jolted into life, as soon as we moved
into the opera proper. An important feature of Dido and Aeneas is that
Purcell wrote it to be sung all the way through, but that effect is lost if
the Prologue can only be performed like a masque, as spoken drama with
music. The inherent power of the opera itself was in any case marvellously
shown by this EBF production, a noble realisation for all its evident need
to watch the pennies.
No Restoration extravagances here. Tom Hawkes provided just simple stage
effects and a producer's acumen in how to bring out the devastating
emotional force in Purcell's drama. In this hall an orchestra of seven
(strings, lute and harpsichord) proved sufficient; but a chorus of four was
more of a sacrifice, as they could hardly be expected to echo themselves
from afar. Kathleen Tynan was an excellent Belinda and Nigel Leeson-Williams
sang a burly warrior of an Aeneas.
Still all this might not have succeeded, if the performance had not found so
striking a focal point in its central performer. A specious argument was
proffered in the programme as to why Della Jones had been asked to take on
the roles both of Dido and the Sorceress, but her magnificent accomplishment
of the task was reason enough. As the Sorceress, she pushed her voice; but
as Dido, she triumphed in regal style.
In an uncanny way her performance spanned the centuries: sometimes the clean
singing of intricately decorated vocal lines suggested period practice, at
others she left all that behind and let fly with the full-range of
modern-day expression. More important, the whole tragic spirit of Purcell's
Dido seemed to be alive in her hands. It was there that this Dido and Aeneas
found its true raison d'etre.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Arts: An epic evening with Nielsen's 'Saul and David' -
Concert and semi-staged opera performances at the Barbican and Queen
Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nielsen's first opera Saul og David has stayed outside the repertory in
Britain. It has been staged here just once - in a semi-professional
production in 1977 - though a new Danish recording was released last year.
As part of 'Tender is the North' at the Barbican on Monday the BBC Symphony
Orchestra and Chorus undertook a concert performance: a vivid, impassioned
account conducted by Andrew Davis, sung in Danish with a mix of British and
Danish soloists.
The dramatic tenacity of the score in the concert hall squashed all
suspicions that this Biblical epic is really oratorio passed off as opera.
The choruses may be striking inspirations and integral to the dramatic
structure, but the work hinges genuinely upon its juxtaposition of the
central characters - Saul and David, Saul's children Jonathan and Mikal and
the prophet Samuel - and the ways in which their psychologies are probed and
analysed. That Nielsen works much of this out in terms of inherited operatic
stereotypes rather than through freshly minted invention never threatens the
work's integrity, just fails to clinch its originality; what is memorable is
the sustained effect of Saul and David, rather than any of its specific
details.
By the time he came to write the opera at the turn of the century Nielsen
had learnt his craft well. Musorgsky's Boris Godunov is commonly cited as
Saul and David's precursor; that source is especially evident in Saul's
monologues and the set-piece choruses, and Nielsen was after all a
nationalist composer of his own devising, one derived at several removes
from Musorgsky's example. But there is a good deal of Wagner in the writing
too (hints of Gotterdammerung in Samuel's grave pronouncements) and even of
the 19th-century Italian tradition in the lyric duet for David and Mikal
that ends the first act. If the opera never quite takes off or becomes more
than the sum of these identifiable parts it is plotted with great economy
and directness, carved out in massive tonal arches. As Andrew Davis
recognised, the music always knows where it wants to go and generates the
momentum it needs to get there.
Ideally the vocal writing requires more weight than mustered in the Barbican
cast, singers with Wagnerian powers of declamation - one of the early
interpreters of the role of Mikal was Kirsten Flagstad, while the recent
recording cast Aage Haugland as Saul. But here with Ulrik Cold as a flexible
Saul, Kurt Westi a persuasive David and Christian Christiansen a sepulchral
Samuel the performances were consistently involved; Eva Johansson joined
well with Westi in Mikal's duets, and John Mark Ainsley added a finely drawn
Jonathan to his own increasing operatic gallery.
On Sunday Colin Davis and the London Symphony Orchestra had added a further
instalment to their cycle of the Sibelius symphonies, which is proving to be
the glorious centrepiece of this Scandinavian celebration. Davis's powers as
a Sibelius interpreter have grown steadily over two decades; but until this
concert he had never tackled Kullervo, the symphony for voices and orchestra
based upon an episode from the Finnish Kalevala which preceded the numbered
symphonies and furnished so much of Sibelius's later music.
In Finland Kullervo has tremendous nationalist significance and in Britain
performances have been increasingly frequent over recent years. Davis's
account though surpassed any I had heard in its purposeful power and its
refusal to be ambushed by any of the work's longueurs. Even the long central
movement 'Kullervo and his Sister' remained on course and culminated in
wonderful declamatory solos from the baritone Jorma Hynninen and the soprano
Soile Isokoski. The choir was the Helsinki University Chorus, which has made
Kullervo its own speciality; the LSO, enjoying a vintage period at the
moment, never failed in its attention to detail.

The growing use of guns in British crime is widely acknowledged, but were
you aware of 'an alarming increase in drugs-related gun violence among
Britain's African-Caribbean community' ? It is the sort of matter which is
nervously skirted by politically correct current affairs people for fear of
being seen as racist. Good old Open Space, however, BBC2's access slot, has
an account by Sheldon 'Curfew' Thomas, member of a group of rap and reggae
artists, who calls for action to curb this black-on-black violence (7.40).
Today's Bookmark sounds like a collector's item. Poets read their work on
the subject of love and reflect upon the phenomenon. It seems that Hugo
Williams' wife finds his poems 'ludicrous ..but she's French', and Wendy
Cope does not think she will ever stop falling in love, often with other
poets (8.10 BBC2). Dispatches is very excited about the degree of access it
achieved in making today's programme about Britain's presidency of the EC,
seen partly from the inside of the Foreign Office and even from within a
cabinet committee. It promises to be a timely report given that it is now
only two days before the Edinburgh summit (9.00 C4).

FT  09 DEC 92 / Arts: Trelawny of the Wells - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a mass of theatrical history behind Trelawny of the Wells. Over the
years it has been Arthur Wing Pinero's most popular work, far ahead of what
Hilaire Belloc called 'that interesting play, The Second Mrs Tanqueray'. But
not even Pinero (1855-1934) could have expected to see two major productions
of Trelawny in London in 1992-93. The first opened at the Comedy on Monday;
the second will be at the Royal National Theatre in the new year.
A word of warning may be in order. The first half of the Comedy production
is leaden to an unexpected degree. Do not form a judgment at the interval,
for the second half takes off. This may be because of the veteran Sir
Michael Hordern, rumoured to be making perhaps his last West End stage
appearance.
Hordern plays the part of Sir William Gower who, in the first half, is a
very dour fellow indeed. Vice-Chancellor of the legal profession, he lives
with his even more repressed sister in Cavendish Square, sleeps briefly
after dinner before devoting his intellectual energies to playing whist (not
even bridge). Almost none of the first half jokes and situations succeed,
including the introduction of the team of troupers at the Wells.
Then comes the transformation. The Vice-Chancellor turns out to have been a
more lively man in his youth: having seen Edmund Kean act, he had an eye for
what he calls the 'gypsy profession' himself. Toby Robertson's direction is
worth seeing for Hordern's second half showing alone. Even when he just
grunts, and he does a lot of that, Sir Michael remains a formidable stage
presence. He exudes old-fashioned authority; everyone defers to it.
For the rest, some background may help. Pinero was an actor before turning
to writing. He switched when realism in the theatre was just coming in and
was not immediately popular. One of the characters in Trelawny is called Tom
Wrench. He is drawn from the real-life playwright, now largely forgotten, T.
W. Robertson (1829-71). Robertson came from a huge theatrical family. It was
Robertson who - before Chekhov, Ibsen, Shaw and Granville-Barker - tried to
introduce realism to the stage. He was known for his 'cup-and-saucer drama'.
While much of Trelawny is farce, the background is the struggle for what the
theatre should be about. The Wells is Sadler's Wells where some of the
innovations, and some of the resistance, took place. The Trelawny of the
title is not a squire, but Rose, the juvenile lead who started in musical
comedies until she became more serious and was temporarily sacked. You can
see the influence on Shaw: there is a touch of Eliza Doolittle in Rose.
Some of Trelawny comes close to Victorian melodrama, though perhaps this is
satirical. The Vice-Chancellor, for instance, could very well turn out to be
a villain and his grandson come to a sticky end. Yet what you get, above
all, is the fascination with theatre which, around the end of the 19th
century, went into one of its most productive periods. Pinero was steeped in
it.
There are some wonderful ironies. The Vice-Chancellor recalls his
theatre-going youth, does a little walk like a hunchback, then reflects on
the decadence of the new realism: 'When I saw Kean as Richard, he reminded
me of no member of my family. Shakespeare knew better than that.'
Rose is played by Sarah Brightman. She is far too professional ever to put a
leg wrong, but is a surprisingly mature actress to be cast as a 19-year-old
juvenile lead. A touch of the ingenue might liven things up in the style of
Sara Crowe. Some of the smaller parts are excellent, especially Kelly Hunter
as the splendidly named Avonia Bunn. It cannot be beyond Toby Robertson to
quicken the pace of the first hour or so.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Plastic in the park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chicago's Park District did not intend to enter the recycling business three
years ago when it untook to refurbish 360 of its neighbourhood playgrounds.
Some 3.5m pounds of plastic later, the city has become a model for other
communities seeking to convert household waste into indestructible timber
substitutes, park benches and play equipment.
The city stumbled into its Plastic On Parks programme after one manufacturer
suggested that plastic would survive the hazards of Chicago's winters and
gang graffiti better than wood. At first the idea did not seem attractive -
plastic was nearly twice as expensive as wood. However, the gap would be
halved if the City provided the raw plastic for the programme.
Gathering piles of used milk and soft drink bottles, cleaning-fluid
containers and plastic shopping bags seemed daunting at first. Chicago had
no city-wide recycling programme, but bins were set out at 263 park sports
facilities. Residents were encouraged to drop off their empties.
'The first week we collected 400 pounds and thought we had a good
programme,' recalls Fred White, director of Chicago's parks recycling
programme. 'Now we're collecting 30,000 to 45,000 pounds per week, and
people refuse to let us stop.' Parks staff empty the bins and the discards
are delivered to a recycler for processing. Private donations provided two
new trucks for the programme.
White believes one of the reasons for the programme's success is that people
can see the results of their efforts in their neighbourhoods. A unique
feature of POP is the city's requirement that plastic given to the processor
must return to Chicago.
Hammers Plastic Recycling, the Iowa-based processor for the programme,
recently opened a Chicago manufacturing facility where it has hired 12
people to help fulfil the city's Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) contract.
Ken Iles, marketing director of the company, says the POP plastic is now
being converted into basketball backstops, picnic tables and special plastic
wheelchair ramps for Chicago's beaches, as well as timber substitutes and
park benches.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Japan hedges on carbon tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Japan hosted an international gathering this year on the environment,
there was concern among industry that the country would be committed to a
tax against carbon dioxide emissions.
Instead, the resulting Tokyo Declaration carefully suggested that
governments 'may wish to consider' a carbon tax and other environmental
taxes, but must 'keep in mind the impact on international competitiveness'.
This left the door open for Japan to slap on a tax if it wished.
That door has been shut firmly for the indefinite future by a report from
three energy advisory panels to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, which wants to be seen as green but must also perform its
sometimes conflicting role as defender of industrial interests.
The panels' final report suggests that Japan may do more harm than good by
introducing a carbon tax. 'In the event that such an initiative lacks
international conformity, it would invite the international migration of
industry,' the report says. It also reflects concern that the tax would make
Japan less competitive, dragging down economic growth.
Maintaining growth has become a priority for Japanese companies, which have
falling profits and are thus trimming staff, salaries and product ranges.
On delivery of the three panels' combined report, Miti said the
recommendations would be the foundation for future policy. Rather than
highlighting industry opposition to the carbon tax, it preferred that
attention be paid to the report's 14 general proposals for a cleaner
environment.
These include more use of non-fossil fuels, encouraging environment-friendly
business behaviour, promoting recycling and accelerating the development of
technology to protect the environment.
In a 'to be considered' category are recommendations that manufacturers
refrain from excessive product changes and streamline components. The
economic downturn has ensured that this is happening, with companies also
using less packaging.
Another consequence of the downturn is a slowing of tax revenue, which
prompted the Ministry of Finance to enter the environment debate, having
reckoned that a CO-related tax would help balance the books. It has
considered doubling the petroleum tax. But it has chosen not to hurry the
carbon tax debate, leaving Miti to exercise its influence. The Environment
Agency, which tends to represent the government at international meetings,
favours a tax based on a scale reflecting the amount of CO emitted, but is
not pressing for immediate deployment.
Yet an EC proposal to introduce carbon taxes is conditional on the US and
Japan adopting similar measures, prompting Tokyo to wonder whether
President-elect Clinton will reverse the US stance against the tax.
Yoshitake Masuhara, planning director at the EA, says Japan's efforts over
the past two decades to reduce emissions must be considered by foreign
governments.
'Japan accounts for about 15 per cent of global GNP, but only for 4.8 per
cent of emissions. The US accounts for about a quarter of GNP and a quarter
of the emissions,' Masuhara said. 'We are disappointed that the Japanese
government has not clearly supported a carbon tax, but we think the tax
alone is not enough.'

FT  09 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Too much of a good thing - As
recycling laws take hold in the US, manufacturers have the most to lose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bitter battle over recycling in the US is pitting environmentalists
against many manufacturers, especially in the plastics and food processing
industries.
The new tension comes from the growing public demand for efficient
recycling. While rising public enthusiasm and more curbside collection has
boosted the supply of recycled materials, demand for recycled goods is still
weak. Many communities pay heavily for recycling programmes only to watch
the materials languish unused.
What worries many US industries is that more and more cities and states are
adopting complex legislation which calls for industry, rather than local
governments, to carry much of the recycling burden.
The state of Oregon, for instance, has adopted a law forcing companies to
adopt one of a series of environmentally friendly options:
Use packaging which contains a certain percentage of recycled materials  -
25 per cent by 1995, 50 per cent by 2000.
Guarantee a similar rate of recycling for the materials in question - by
reprocessing the materials themselves if need be.
Severely reduce the total amount of packaging used.
The twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul in the state of Minnesota adopted
similar, though less restrictive, measures. And a bill even more ambitious
than the Oregon legislation was laid aside in Massachusetts only after
industry spent Dollars 5.5m (Pounds 3.6m) to defeat a plebiscite vote. Other
recycling controls are becoming widespread. Eleven states now require
newspaper print to contain a minimum of up to 40 per cent recycled content,
and another 25 have voluntary programmes.
Nine states enforce 'bottle bills', which require beverage companies to ask
for a deposit and re-use collected bottles. And 30 have legislation
requiring local and state governments to purchase a certain amount of
recycled office materials. Perhaps most frightening to opponents of
recycling laws, legislation is before Congress which would institute
repackaging requirements on a nationwide basis.
'Public pressure is mounting to boost recycling,' said Roger Bernstein,
director of government affairs for the American Plastics Council. Of all
manufacturing segments, perhaps none is more concerned than the plastics
industry. Plastic is extremely difficult to recycle, since so many types are
used. A mere 2 per cent of the plastic discarded in the US is currently
reprocessed.
Moreover, plastic is criticised by many environmentalists for its
indestructibility. The rising tide against the plastics industry has it so
worried that it has just launched a national public relations campaign to
promote the environmental soundness of the product.
Despite industry concerns, repackaging laws seem to be the wave of the
future, and defenders of the measures say they are extremely effective in
cutting down on waste. 'Several new paper recycling plants have opened up in
Oregon over the last few years, and we've seen some real progress on glass,'
said Joel Ario, director of the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group
which sponsored the repackaging legislation.
James River Company, for instance, has just opened its first office supply
paper recycling plant in Oregon. Nationally, increased demand for recycled
materials has led to a big increase in recovered paper used in newsprint.
At a time when total newsprint production is declining, the amount of
recycled newsprint produced in the US rose from 1.9bn tonnes in 1990 to an
estimated 2.5bn tonnes this year, according to the American Paper Institute.
That figure is set to surge to 3.2bn in 1994. Still, many observers say
progress on the recycling front has been driven more by improved technology
than by any increase in demand through environmental legislation.
'We put in a magnetic screening system 12 years ago and just added a
non-ferrous metal detector,' said Ronald Sprague, plant manager for glass
recycling with Owens Brockway in Oregon. 'I don't think the new laws make
any difference. It's the technology that counts. If someone can figure out
how to re-use something cheaply, they will. Our recycling rates are between
60 and 80 per cent for glass in this state, well above those required by law
up to the year 2000.'
Not all segments have such an easy time meeting targets. Critics say that
the new repackaging bills can be too expensive, or simply unworkable. 'These
sorts of laws can cause chaos,' said Carol Rawlston, vice president in
charge of government affairs for the American Paper Institute. 'For
instance, some sorts of food packaging - such as for milk - can't use
recycled material. There are too many contaminants involved, and it would go
against packaging standards set by the federal government to guard people's
health.'
Similar problems are cited for bottle collection. 'Some of the chemicals
people used to use to clean the bottles are now considered toxic,' said
Sprague. 'And a lot of small grocery stores have found that they don't have
the space to collect used bottles.'
Even if more states adopt repackaging laws, environmentalists may face
obstacles in getting companies to comply. 'Boxes for Wheaties cereal have
been made of recycled paper since 1950, just because that was the cheapest
material available,' said Lawrence Sawyer, director of government relations
for General Mills.
'But the actual bag that the cereal is packed in within that box is 100 per
cent virgin. It has to be for health reasons. You can pass all the
legislation you want, but no one can make us comply if the consumers' safety
is at risk.'
With both sides arming themselves to the hilt, the battle between
environmentalists and industry on the recycling question will probably
continue for some time. But with the concept of recycling enjoying high
rates of public approval, industries like plastics, bottlers and food
processors are concerned that, in the long run, they will be the losers.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Jobs: Wanted, way to escape the grinder - Professionals
stumped by problem of how to break out of self-sustaining downward spiral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF there's any other group of people anywhere with a better stock of work
experience than Jobs-column readers, I've yet to hear of it. So you are
probably Anna Greenwood's best hope of finding a solution to a problem
which, although all too common in working life even at pretty senior levels,
is an extremely knotty one.
Brought to her by someone met via her job as a clinical psychologist in
Yorkshire, it concerns a seemingly guaranteed way in which a new boss can
grind down and drive out a disliked but previously proficient subordinate.
The process has four stages, the first of which is enigmatic because it
might simply amount to unwittingly bad management. But if it's allowed to go
on long, the results - being foreseeable - might just as well be intended.
It begins when the boss takes to keeping detailed watch on the
staff-member's work, obviously looking for errors. Accompanying ploys are
nagging on about the need to do routine tasks hitherto done without
supervision, questioning any action whose purpose isn't instantly
self-evident, and showing suspicion that the subordinate is either flouting
or has misunderstood the proper procedure.
Typically, the immediate result is that the target staff-member checks
everything twice and starts to hesitate before making even the clearest-cut
decisions. That in turn results in a slower work-rate, which supplies a real
cause of complaint to the superior.
Moreover, it ushers in stage two because with the boss now justified in
adding criticism of the slowness to the earlier torments, the target is
likely to rush the job, so making mistakes. Hard evidence of unreliability
is thus added to the charge-sheet.
Under the redoubled pressure, the subordinate is apt to move the process
into stage three by losing confidence in his or her own ability. The
consequent worrying about what's the right thing to do, let alone how to do
it, typically leads to markedly reduced performance all-round and so to . .
. .
Stage four: the target either resigns, is demoted, gets sacked, or ends up
being treated by the likes of Anna Greenwood as a case of mental breakdown.
Hence her search for a means by which the subordinate can break out of the
self-sustaining downward spiral - a quest which she began by appealing to
her professional colleagues through the British Psychological Society's
journal.
Although it brought in a good many recommendations, she says, none of them
looks likely to be fully effective. Even where there are formal complaints
procedures, for example, they tend to be counter-productive unless the
target belongs to a union strongly ensconced in the company or, if not, when
the boss concerned is only low in the executive hierarchy. In the case of
complaints against more senior managers, research suggests it is odds-on
that the higher level will be upheld over the lower.
Another cure mooted by the replies is to tackle the boss directly as soon as
the stage-one pattern is discernible. Unfortunately, Anna Greenwood says,
people need a lot of working experience to twig what's happening so early,
and still more to know that allowing it to continue can be at least as
damaging as a confrontation with authority.
Even the canniest of the proposals, she adds, is prone to the same snags. It
is to respond willingly to whatever demands are made at the workplace, and
during breaks to be overheard by gossipy colleagues expressing genuine
concern about the pressures making such an able boss behave so stressfully.
Accordingly - recalling that two years ago readers decoded the medieval
spelling of the name of a port which had defeated the French historian,
Professor Bartolome Bennassar - I'm hoping that you can once again do better
than the professional experts.
N
OW to the table below which gives indicators of going-rates of pay for upper
ranks of managers in Britain, as shown by the latest survey made for the
Institute of Directors by the Reward consultancy. The full report,
containing detailed data drawn from a sample of thousands, costs Pounds 350
and is obtainable from Steve Flather at Reward House, Diamond Way, Stone,
Staffs ST15 0SD; tel 0785 813566, fax 0785 817007.
My extracts are limited to six broad ranks - from fully executive chairmen
to middle managers three perches below board-level - employed by companies
in three turnover brackets, which overlap.
In each case, the table gives both salary and total cash rewards including
bonuses. The lower quartile refers to the executive a quarter way up from
the foot of a ranking of all in the same rank and turnover range, the median
to the person mid-way, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down.
The figures are for the UK as a whole, taking no account of regional
variances which can be considerable. To allow for rises since the
information was collected, all the salaries should be increased by 0.7 per
cent and by a further 0.35 per cent for each month from January onwards.
One clear message from the table is that whatever advantages success as a
manager may bring in small outfits, they are not of the material sort. In
the up-to-Pounds 25m bracket the median chairman's total pay is just over 2
1/2 times that of the rank-three manager. In the Pounds 20m-Pounds 250m band
the difference is 5 1/4 times, and at Pounds 200m-plus it is nearly eight
times.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Greener, chief executive of Guinness, who also takes over as chairman
from Sir Anthony Tennant in January, yesterday announced a series of senior
appointments designed to smooth the management transition at the
international drinks group.
Philip Yea (right), 37, finance director of Guinness Brewing Worldwide
(GBW), becomes group finance director (designate) and will progressively
take over the responsibilities of Ian Duncan, managing director, finance and
administration, who retires in the second half of next year.
Yea joined Guinness in 1984 and held a number of financial posts before
leaving in 1988 to become finance director of Cope Allman. He returned to
Guinness as director of financial control last year. Michael Kayser, GBW's
business development director, will replace Yea as GBW's finance director.
Brendan O'Neill (far right), 44, managing director for the past two years of
the international region of United Distil-lers (UD), the group's spirits
company, will switch to the brewing division in February as managing
director of GBW. O'Neill joined Guinness from Midland Bank in 1987 as
director of financial control. He was UD's finance director from 1988-1991.
Walter Caldwell, UD's regional director, northern Europe, will succeed him
as md of the international region.
Brian Baldock, 58, will remain chairman of GBW, but in his role as Guinness
deputy chairman is taking on additional responsibilities for the group's
public and strategic affairs, Gleneagles hotel, and Guinness Publishing.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Management: Finance chiefs called to account - Why women
accountants leave hospital jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WENDY MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The secret of attaining a top financial job within the NHS is the ability to
drink, Marilyn Palmer was advised early in her career. 'If you can't hold
your liquor you will never be a director of finance,' counselled one senior
manager.
Despite eschewing what she calls the 'boys' club' culture represented by
such attitudes, Palmer has successfully scaled the health service ladder
from her first job 12 years ago as a clerk to her appointment last year as
director of finance for the Anglian Harbours NHS trust, responsible for the
Pounds 25m budget of seven hospitals in Great Yarmouth.
But it is a lonely position. Figures from the Department of Health show that
although 61 per cent of NHS finance staff are women, they hold just 9 per
cent of the top grade finance director posts in health authorities and NHS
trusts. The findings of a study commissioned by the health department's
women's unit go some way towards explaining why.
The study, carried out by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy, shows that of 208 women who qualified as chartered accountants
in the NHS between 1980 and 1990, 31 per cent have left. Of those, the
biggest group - 30 per cent - went to local government, 24 per cent left to
start families and 2l per cent joined the private sector.
Asked why they left, 'personal reasons' were given by 20 per cent but salary
came second at 17 per cent. One in five cited lack of career development or
job satisfaction.
But most alarming is a general perception that women's careers are
systematically blocked. More than 70 per cent of those who leave believe
they faced barriers to progression within the NHS and 83 per cent of those
who stay agree. Among the obstacles given are direct discrimination,
outmoded attitudes, absence of childcare and a culture where long,
inflexible hours - 50 to 70 a week - are the norm.
'It is generally thought that if you have a family you are no longer career
minded, especially among male senior managers,' says one woman. 'It is
difficult to get taken seriously by male managers,' says another.
Caroline Langridge, head of the women's unit, is promoting a more
woman-friendly culture in finance departments. She is also trying to change
working patterns that discriminate against female accountants.
There is some evidence of success. All posts are open to job-sharing while
flexible conditions, like working from home, are encouraged. A register has
been set up of women in senior positions who want to be put forward for more
senior posts. And it is now NHS policy that every job shortlist contains at
least one woman candidate.
All this is meant to help boost the number of qualified women accountants
and women managers. The latest figures show women slightly outnumber men in
studying for accountancy qualifications in the NHS. Women make up 32 per
cent of the service's qualified accountants, compared with an estimated 22
per cent a year ago.
Pat Macaulay, head of financial development at the NHS management executive,
believes cultural change is the key. But it should come 'naturally' as women
in senior finance positions become 'role models' and she rejects positive
discrimination or quotas.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Buckley, who has been the catalyst for change at BTP - once British
Tar Products and now a leading maker of lipstick preservatives, beer
clarifiers and flame retardants - will, from January 1, drop the chief
executive's role. Now 64, he will remain chairman. Steve Hannam, who has
headed the chemicals division for 5 1/2 years, will become managing
director.
Buckley, a smoker of enormous cigars, says he used to be simply 'a good
chemist'; working in the US for Allied Chemical Corp, he was in at the birth
of chlorofluorocarbons. CFCs are now on the eco-hitlist, but he recalls how
their use in the Dollars 99.99 air-conditioning system and refrigerators for
the masses in the 1960s was a blessing to the world.
He moved to BTP about 25 years ago as a 'consultant local director'. As the
tar business dried up, the old tanks were used to store all sorts of other
things, churning out the cash that was invested in chemicals.
When 'Pen' Lloyd, the sort of man who hunted with his bones in plaster, died
suddenly in 1979, Buckley became chairman and chief executive. But the group
has maintained some of the traditions of the Lloyd era; it still holds its
annual meeting in early August at the Cafe Royal - in time for the glorious
dash to Scotland.

FT  09 DEC 92 / People: Thoms speaks quietly on his move to Verity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Thoms, newly appointed finance director at Verity Group, is suddenly
much in demand. Ostensibly people want to talk to him about his new job;
really they want the inside story on his old one - finance director of
Amstrad, the troubled UK electronics company which founder Alan Sugar is
trying to take private in one of the most controversial buy-backs the City
has seen for years.
Thoms left Amstrad suddenly in July giving neither reason nor explanation.
He felt hamstrung, he complained at the time, but had been asked to say
nothing. Yesterday he was only a little more expansive, saying it had been
an 'interesting period' but refusing to comment on either his departure or
the present situation at the former high-flying computers-to-video group.
A chartered accountant by training, Thomas, 47, spent 15 years with Gillette
both in Canada and the UK before joining Amstrad in 1989, tempted by its
entrepreneurial image.
Verity, formerly Wharfedale Loudspeakers, is noted for high quality and high
prices. It is also losing money - Pounds 2.9m last year. It has just
acquired Centralforce Holdings which has the Mission and Cyrus loudspeaker
brand names. It is, Thoms believes, a classic turnround situation; the
company now has critical mass to return to profitability, based on the
acknowledged quality of British audio equipment.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Management: NHS reform is a tricky operation - The radical
restructuring of Britain's health service has forced managers to balance
free market principles with public service ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Future management histories of Britain's National Health Service will devote
chapters mulling over whether the use of the term 'market' helped or
hindered last year's reforms.
Conservative politicians certainly took fright at it - even in its tamer,
modified variants such as 'internal market' and 'managed market'  - as
opponents drove home claims that the government was commercialising the
service.
The term had the benefit of signalling to the managers of Europe's largest
employer, with around 1m staff, that last year's restructuring went beyond
previous administrative reorganisations and involved a completely new way of
running the NHS.
But there remains confusion among many managers about precisely what sort of
market they are in and what the norms and limits of market behaviour ought
to be when managing a public welfare service. The answers to these questions
will determine how the reformed NHS develops.
Duncan Nichol, the NHS chief executive, addresses the issue by introducing
another variation to the lexicon of market themes.
'We are operating a social market,' he says, 'and while there is plenty of
information about how free markets operate, we know much less about social
markets. People from other public sector systems are already coming to us
and trying to learn from our experience.'
The NHS reforms have separated the functions of purchasing and providing
healthcare and, through the establishment of self-governing trusts, given
more decision-making power to local managers.
Many of the questions about the nature of Nichol's social market turn on the
extent to which these managers should be allowed to behave in a
free-spirited, competitive way.
'Regulating the market, developing purchasers and monitoring providers -
these are the issues and it is important to achieve the right balance
between them,' he says.
Nichol says he 'does not want to be crawling all over the thing', stifling
development and vitality. 'We don't want to over-regulate and lose all sense
of competition.' But the NHS social market exists to deliver a public
service, he adds, and his central management executive must retain enough
control to enable it to intervene if any local developments appeared to be
against the public interest.
The balance is not an easy one to achieve but the government will try to
provide a structural solution soon when Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, makes decisions about the future powers of regional health
authorities and how they will fit into arrangements for keeping an eye on
trusts. Some of the more pioneering trust managers expect the government to
retain more involvement in the market than they would wish.
A survey published last month by Arthur Andersen, management consultants,
asked senior NHS managers what they saw as their most fundamental future
challenges.
While some of the responses - including handling next year's community care
reforms successfully and meeting the requirements of the government's
Patient's Charter - accord with Nichol's priorities for the coming year, the
managers also raised 'making the market function without undue influence
from the centre in the face of questionable political will' as a problem.
The market mentality may have already contributed to at least one
undesirable side-effect in NHS management. Last summer, Nichol had to warn
his management team away from adopting a 'You have an hour to clear your
desk' syndrome in their handling of staff changes arising from the reforms.
'It is an attitude that some people might think they are borrowing from the
private sector,' he told the Institute of Health Services Management
conference disapprovingly.
Since then, several other local difficulties in the NHS management have
received widespread publicity. John Wilby, chief executive of the London
Ambulance Service, resigned following the failure of its new computerised
control system.
A National Audit Office report has criticised serious shortcomings in
financial controls in West Midlands and Wessex regional health authorities -
in the former case over a consultancy exercise and in the latter an abortive
Pounds 43m information technology programme.
The NAO report added that the transfer of part of Wessex's IT function to
private companies, staffed largely by former employees, had not been in the
interests of the region.
Does Nichol feel the perceived pressure of the market is again encouraging
managers to believe they have to borrow values from the private sector,
taking risks and gambles and adopting management styles that are
inappropriate in a public service?
'I don't think it is a question of managers feeling they need to imitate the
private sector. But we have been working to a very crowded agenda during the
introduction of the reforms and NHS managers have to realise they must get
the basics right in order to earn the legitimacy to explore the bigger
agenda, he says.
'Sound management of public money and attention to administrative detail are
important components of getting the basics right. The normal ethics of
public sector management remain the entirely appropriate standards for
managers in the NHS.'
The team of front-line decision-makers in the NHS management is increasing
annually. A further 128 hospitals and other services will become third wave
trusts next April, taking the total to 284. Still more trusts will be formed
in a fourth wave a year later.
Many of the most competent exponents of the managerial freedoms offered by
trust status were among the first and second wave applicants and the sheer
size of the NHS makes patchy management quality an inevitable problem.
Nichol says the criteria for deciding whether a hospital's managers were
capable of taking on self-government were not lowered for the third wave. If
problems arose over the 1994 fourth wave, he would prefer to take an extra
year developing management skills rather than launching units into trust
status before they were ready.
Next year, the unwelcome terrain of a tight financial regime will be added
to the obstacle course in which Nichol's managers are trying to reach the
goal of a more efficient service.
For the past three years, health has benefited from more generous annual
funding settlements than most other Whitehall departments to help smooth the
introduction of the reforms. Next year will be different. The best prospect
 -if the government's inflation expectations hold good - is for a 1 per cent
real terms increase in funding.
This message has been communicated by Nichol to NHS managers, not as a
policy for containment but as one for growth. He expects his management team
in hospitals and health authorities to deliver a 2.5 per cent increase in
treating patients.
This will be possible only if they hit what he describes as the 'challenging
but achievable' target of augmenting the extra government cash with another
2 per cent in efficiency savings from achievements like treating more
patients with the same resources.
For seasoned managers, it will be just like old times. Although the
structure is different, the real test of an NHS manager has always been his
or her success at keeping the system running when the money is tight.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Plea bargaining 'favoured by most judges'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 90 per cent of bar-risters and two thirds of judges favour a formal
system of plea bargaining, a survey of Crown Court trials by the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice has indicated.
The study, based on questionnaires sent to participants in every Crown Court
trial in England and Wales during the last two weeks of February, found
almost universal approval for the jury system. Little evidence was found of
jurors being unable to understand evidence, although judges, barristers and
defence solicitors said they had been surprised by the jury's verdict in
about 15 per cent of cases.
The police and the Crown Prosecution Service said they were surprised by the
verdict in about 25 per cent of cases. The police found half of all
acquittals surprising but thought that only 8 per cent of jury decisions
were inexplicable in the light of the evidence.
In 53 cases heard during the two weeks the defence barrister voiced concern
that an innocent defendant had pleaded guilty either in the hope of getting
a discount on sentence or a reduction in the indictment. Grossed up, this
would mean that there were more than 1,000 such inconsistent pleaders in
Crown Courts each year.
Seventy per cent of defendants who pleaded guilty said they had committed
the offence charged and a further 17 per cent said they had committed a
similar offence.
But 13 per cent claimed not to have committed the offence for which they had
pleaded guilty.
Prosecution barristers thought in 67 guilty-plea cases that the defendant
would have stood a fair chance of being acquitted if he or she had pleaded
not guilty. Grossed up, that would mean 1,700 such cases a year.
In 89 cases, equivalent to well over 2,000 cases a year, the prosecution
barrister thought the case was too weak and should not have been brought.
Judges felt there were 116 (more than 3,000 a year) cases which were too
weak.
The survey results were presented in London last night by Professor Michael
Zander, a member of the Royal Commission.
Prof Zander said he was unable to comment on the findings until the
Commission reported next summer. Howeverm, he offered the tentative view
that the results might mean that the system was working better than had been
first thought.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Scots accountants urge audit move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL COMPANIES should be free from the requirement to have a statutory
audit and should be allowed to disincorporate more easily, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland has recommended.
An institute working party says the audit required by successive Companies
Acts should be replaced by an annual accountants' report.
That reflects the feeling that time spent by auditors could be put to better
use, allowing accountants to advise managers on how to run their businesses
more effectively.
The institute says the audit is 'inappropriate' because it places too great
an administrative burden on smaller companies. It adds that the commercial
and fiscal environment has changed considerably since the 1960s, when many
small businesses were advised to incorporate. Now many are locked into an
unsuitable legal and tax structure.
The Department of Trade and Industry announced earlier this year that it was
considering lifting the requirement for a compulsory audit for companies
below the value added tax threshold of Pounds 36,600 annual turnover. It is
expected to produce a consultation paper on the subject early next year.
Some other professional bodies including the Chartered Institute of
Management Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales have given support to the idea of abolishing the audit of small
companies.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants has traditionally opposed
abolition, arguing that the audit is the price of limited liability. It is
also reconsidering its position.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Male nurse wins sex prejudice case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 50-year-old man who applied for a job in a children's nursery has won a
sex discrimination case over being turned down for the post of nursery
nurse.
Mr Charles Shiells, from Liverpool, applied through a Jobcentre for a
vacancy at the city's Tuebrook Tots Nursery but was told it had no toilet
facilities for men.
Mr Shiells, a qualified nursery nurse, took the nursery to an industrial
tribunal claiming sex discrimination and was awarded Pounds 600
compensation. He was backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
The nursery's management claimed that Mr Shiells was too old for the job and
that his sex was not relevant.
The last round in the legal battle over the level of compensation for people
who suffer sex discrimination at work finished yesterday in the European
Court of Justice with judgment expected in the new year.
The court will decide whether the Pounds 10,000 limit on compensation
awarded by industrial tribunals in sex discrimination cases is valid under
EC law and whether tribunals can order interest payments.
The test case was brought by Ms Helen Marshall who in 1986 won a landmark
sex discrimination case in the court after being forced to retire at 62.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Half of workers 'fear job losses'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST HALF the population believes there will be job losses at their
workplace in the new year and one in seven fear their own jobs are at risk
if the recession continues, Emma Tucker and Daniel Green write.
These results of a survey published yesterday by the British Market Research
Bureau underline fears that people's anxiety about unemployment will hold
back economic recovery.
The survey, in which BMRB polled 1,028 people between last Friday and
Sunday, was carried out on behalf of the Trades Union Congress and published
to run ahead of today's TUC National Recovery Day.
Two out of three people polled believed prospects for economic recovery had
worsened over the past year and 77 per cent lacked confidence in the
government to lead the country out of recession.
The findings come when there are some indications that the economy could be
showing signs of a slow recovery.
Yesterday Infolink, the UK's biggest credit information organisation, said
consumer credit inquiries rose 5 per cent in the first week of December
compared with the same period a year ago.
Mr Brian Bailey, Infolink's chairman, said the figures represented 'a very
significant rise', although he emphasised that they reflected enquiries
rather than sales.

FT  09 DEC 92 / TSB to shed 400 more junior managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB yesterday disclosed that it expects nearly to double the number of staff
redundancies caused by the merger of its banking and insurance operations by
making 400 junior branch managers redundant in the new year.
The bank, which announced last month that it was making 440 staff redundant,
said the merger of operations into TSB Retail Banking and Insurance with the
downgrading of 200 branches had left it with surplus junior managers.
The disclosure is the latest in a series of job cuts in banks, many
resulting from the restructuring of branch networks. Barclays expects to
have reduced its staff by 18,000 between 1991 and 1995.
TSB yesterday briefed the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union on the job
cuts. Bifu is already balloting its members at the bank on a series of
one-day strikes in protest at the job cuts that were announced earlier.
The bank said the managers affected were staff who worked as assistants to
branch managers. Some would be affected by the downgrading of branches
because such branches would be left with only a single manager. It said it
would try to avoid compulsory redundancies among junior managers but could
not guarantee that all would be voluntary. It expected that most of the
redundancies would be agreed by early next year.
The earlier tranche of redundancies included 80 senior managers and 150
managers from the branch network. A further 120 computer staff and 90
clerical staff from within the retail and insurance operations are to lose
their jobs.
Bifu said yesterday before meeting TSB that it was worried that there could
be further redundancies in the branch network. The union criticised the
first job cuts as 'totally indefensible' and damaging to customer service.
TSB employs a total of 25,000 staff. It is implementing a series of changes
in the structure of branches intended to make its sales operation through
the network more effective. In the past, insurance sales operated
separately.
The union has also come into conflict with the bank over its plans for an
experimental 24-hour telephone service supporting its branch network.
The service is being tested in Tyneside as part of a branch restructuring
pilot scheme.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Depressed economy needs shock therapy: Psychology and the
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK is behaving like a depressed person immersed in the gloom of
recession. The incentives offered by the government in the Autumn Statement
are not enough to chivvy the nation out of its economic sluggishness.
That, at least, is the diagnosis of a number of social psychologists.
Collectively we are perpetuating the gloom of the recession, they say, with
the media reinforcing harsh messages about the economy so that even people
with safe jobs and financially secure homes have become nervous.
This does not mean that cheerier news bulletins would jolt us out of our
economic torpor.
After all, the current lack of confidence reflects some brutal economic
facts. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has already learnt that attempting
to talk the economy out of recession does not work.
His promise in the autumn last year of 'green shoots' of recovery probably
made things worse by increasing the cynicism among already wary consumers
and businesses.
Psychologists addressing the issue of consumer confidence believe it will be
a while before the country can break out of its recessionary frame of mind.
Dr James Thompson, senior lecturer in psychology at London University,
believes we are heading for the decade of 'making do'. He says: 'At the
moment people are frightened, confused and suspicious.' The classic 'freeze'
response to fear has enveloped us as a nation.
'People have decided to cut their losses, pay back their debts and avoid
frivolous purchases. In fact the cheapest thing to do is stay at home and
watch programmes about the recession.'
This retrenching behaviour makes sense to the individual because it
maximises the feeling of personal security, but collectively it perpetuates
the sluggishness of the economy.
The insecurity, says Dr Thompson, is compounded by feelings people have that
they have been conned by various statements about the economy. The
government needs to address people's deepest fears. 'The message that it is
all going to be all right is no longer believed,' he says.
Caution among consumers is matched by extensive prudence in the financial
and business world.
Mr Nigel Nicholson, director of the Centre for Organisational Research at
the London Business School, points out that risk-takers tend to retreat into
the woodwork during a recession, leaving only the boldest of entrepreneurs
to take risks.
Here another vicious circle develops. 'Entrepreneurs go to banks which are
peopled by non-risk takers,' Mr Nicholson explains.
'They become even more cautious during a recession, so it is very difficult
to raise finance.'
The problem of finding a way of pulling the UK out of its recessionary
mind-set taxes psychologists.
Mr Nicholson argues that emerging from the recession requires boldness on
the part of people who are institutionally cautious, in other words bankers
and other lenders.
'We can rely on entrepreneurs to get us out of recession, but only if they
are supported by the people with the funds,' he says. 'Risk takers will
still look for risks to take even in a situation where there are not many.'
The success of the risk takers will gradually spread as more cautious
members of society follow. He is confident the process will take its natural
course. 'This will happen,' Mr Nicholson says. 'Indeed, we will probably
look back and find it has already started. There are already people doing
exciting and productive things in the economy.'
Dr David Good, a social psychologist at King's College, Cambridge, is less
certain. The situation has become too confused this time round for
confidence to take its usual recovery course, he says. 'People's worlds have
become muddied so that they no longer know the rules. They find they can be
model employees but still lose their jobs.'
Dr Good favours shock treatment as a remedy for the recession. 'If you want
to change people's mentality, you have to do something big,' he says. 'It is
no good cutting rates by a couple of points and buying up a few houses. But
it is hard to see what would jolt us now.'
One solution, suggests Mr Good, would be the classic Keynesian approach of
spending on public works.
'If money is spent publicly it gets a wider appreciation and people's
experience of public life - travelling, walking in the park, going to
hospital - becomes less tawdry,' he says. 'They get a very real sense of
life being nicer.'
Dr Thompson is another exponent of radical change. 'One has to make quite a
substantial change to make people confident again,' he says.
'I argue, as a psychologist, that the best way of getting confidence back is
to show people there is a functional relationship between what they are
doing and what the country needs.'
In a fragmented economy this would not be an easy task, but Dr Thompson
believes a switch away from service industries towards exportable
manufactured goods would improve sentiment.
In addition, national objectives would give people a greater sense of
purpose - as it did during the second world war. But, fuel, food, housing
and transport targets, are unlikely to become part of this government's
policy.
Meanwhile the authorities, with their three-point cut in base rates,
devaluation and small fiscal tinkering, have administered roughly the
equivalent of a couple of aspirin where electric shock treatment would be
more appropriate.
Many retailers have concluded there are no short-term solutions to the
problems of the nation's damaged psyche and that we are in for a sober
decade. Kingfisher, the stores group, has produced a report entitled Retail
2000, which examines the 1980s and considers the 'older, wiser and more
cynical' consumer of the 1990s.
'No one has been immune from it, but the key 35-60 age group has been hit
harder than most because they are the people suffering from the lingering
effects of high mortgage rates and falling property values,' the report
says.
Kingfisher says the result will mean an ever more cautious approach to
spending and a long period in which people live within their means and save
more, and buy less on credit - and less on impulse.

that is to promise not to put interest rates back up again now. No one

FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour worries on Smith emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUMBLINGS of impatience with Mr John Smith's softly-softly leadership style
were emerging openly yesterday with some backbench and extra-parliamentary
critics urging a higher profile for the Labour leader.
While loyalists remain insistent that Mr Smith has plenty of time before the
next election to put his stamp on the party, there has been criticism behind
the scenes for some time that Labour has not yet seized the agenda from a
widely discredited government.
Mr Bryan Gould, the MP for Dagenham who was defeated in July's leadership
election, yesterday openly addressed the question in a BBC radio interview.
While praising Mr Smith's abilities as a debater and a 'reassuring figure',
he added: 'It is pointless to pretend that there is not some degree of
unease in the party about what is seen as a lack of direction, perhaps even
a lack of vision.'
His remarks were echoed by Mr Peter Hain, the Tribunite MP for Neath, who
appeared to single out Mr Gordon Brown for criticism without directly
mentioning the shadow chancellor by name.
'We are fine in attacking the shortcomings and shambles of Norman Lamont's
policies and the prime minister's economic programme, but we are not
offering a clear and distinct alternative,' he said.
Both the Labour Co-ordinating Committee - the constituency activists'
grouping - and the Fabian Society are preparing strategy papers intended to
fill what they see as a policy vacuum.
Supporters of the leadership say Mr Smith has had little inclination or
opportunity to grab the headlines because of the stream of damaging
newspaper articles about the government. They say policy documents on
Labour's union links and electoral reform are due in January. The promised
independent Commission on Social Justice, covering tax and benefits, will be
announced shortly. Mr Smith is expected to make an important speech soon on
constitutional reform.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: AEEU to raise party payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHY MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEEU electrical and engineering union yesterday announced a 14 per cent
increase in its contribution to the Labour party, Cathy Milton writes.
The increase of more than Pounds 100,000 is matched by a corresponding
increase in the notional number of members the union plans to affiliate to
Labour to 510,000 at Pounds 1.70 each. It will only partly offset the
decision last week by the TGWU general union to cut its contribution by
Pounds 500,000 and reduce affiliated members by more than 250,000 by 1994.
The move was agreed by the executive of the AEEU, formed by the recent
merger of the AEU engineering union and the EETPU electricians' union.
A review group is wrangling over the extent unions should influence party
elections and the annual conference.
The AEEU supports a move to one-member-one-vote for the party leadership and
selection elections while the TGWU would like to see the present electoral
college system survive broadly intact.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Extra help promised for jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL OF 60,000 career development loans are to be made available over the
next three years, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, announced
yesterday.
This is part of the government's strategy of focusing resources on practical
help for job-seekers, she told MPs.
During a Labour-originated debate on unemployment, Mrs Shephard also said an
extra 180,000 new places were to be provided next year in Jobclubs and on
the Job Interview Guarantee Scheme. Job Review Workshops will get an
additional 10,000 places.
The figures confirm, as indicated last month at the time of the Autumn
Statement, that the government intends to target a greater proportion of
funds on non-training initiatives. Expenditure on training programmes is to
suffer a 3 per cent cut in real terms.
Mrs Shephard said the career development loans - which are provided by the
clearing banks with the government paying interest until training has been
completed - would be available for people in and out of work.
The government's focus in drawing up its plans was on individuals in
greatest need and measures that had proved themselves successful, she said.
Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, placed his emphasis on
training, claiming that the government's training budget per unemployed
person was less than half of what it had been only 'three short years ago'.
Statistics showed the unemployed stood less of a chance of getting a job if
they had been on employment training than if they had not, Mr Dobson argued.
The Autumn Statement had been 'so feeble' that Ms Shephard and her
colleagues had refused to estimate how many jobs it might create.
Labour's motion attacking the government's 'total failure' to tackle rising
unemployment was defeated by 309 votes to 276, a government majority of 33.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on Finance Bill debate time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR has warned the government not to use the move to a unified Budget
next year as an excuse for curtailing the Commons' ability to discuss the
Finance Bill.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, is to announce within the next
week the government's plans for the December Budget in a year's time.
The announcement will come in a letter to Mr Nick Brown, an opposition
Treasury spokesman, who last week raised with Mr Dorrell Labour's concerns
that the government would seek to cut the period in which the Finance Bill
was before parliament, and would deal with technical matters in secondary
legislation rather than in the bill itself.
That warning has been underlined by opposition MPs organising extended
debate on a number of technical financial measures - which would normally
get little or no discussion - as a sign of what might happen if ministers
ignored their concerns.
The opposition argued that if the gaps between the different stages of
parliamentary debate on the Finance Bill were shortened, then other
organisations would be less able to offer advice on whether the drafting
accurately reflected government intentions.
At present, the Treasury publishes economic forecasts both at the time of
the Budget in spring and in the Autumn Statement.
Once the two events are combined in a unified Budget, Labour will seek a
set-piece economic debate at Westminster in July to provide a second
forecasting occasion.
The government intends the second Budget next year to take place some three
months earlier than the traditional March Budget arrangements, with the
Finance Bill completing its passage through parliament perhaps by late May.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM attacked over EC role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION leaders rounded on Mr John Major's presidency of the European
Community yesterday with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, claiming he had
'incompetently and humiliatingly bungled' an opportunity to shape the EC's
future.
The attack was joined by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who
charged the prime minister with reducing British influence in the EC by
lacking authority and by failing to give a clear lead.
With Whitehall officials apparently systematically trying to lower hopes of
substantial breakthroughs at the Edinburgh summit at the weekend, both
opposition party leaders were yesterday preparing to pin all the blame on Mr
Major.
At Commons' questions, the prime minister seemed to be taking the same
approach as officials, leading to speculation that his strategy is to lower
hopes deliberately in order to make any agreements eventually reached appear
important victories.
Questioned from his own benches, Mr Major warned that 'a large number of
very complex' issues remained outstanding, ranging from the EC budget,
enlargement of the Community and the so-called Danish problem.
The prime minister said Britain had the lowest corporation tax among the G7
countries and the lowest interest rates in the EC.
He also insisted, to cheers from Conservatives, that there was no question
of Britain allowing its budget rebate to be cut if the question was raised
by other member states at the summit.
Mrs Jacqui Lait (C Hastings and Rye) offered Mr Major the 'total support' of
Tory backbenchers in resisting pressure to give ground on the rebate.
Pressed by Mr Smith to explain why jobs were not at the top of the agenda,
Mr Major said Treasury officials had been touring the Continent to seek
agreement on a Community-wide growth strategy.
'I very much hope that co-ordinated measures will emerge from those
discussion, but we will have to wait and see what our European partners also
feel at Edinburgh,' he said.
In reply, Mr Smith underlined that proposals to stimulate the EC economy
with research and development funding through infrastructure programmes and
job-creation measures had all come from other member states.
Downing Street officials made clear later, however, that the shape of the
package set to be tabled at the summit centres squarely on proposals made
public some time ago.
These comprise policies endorsed in the Autumn Statement on public spending,
stressing capital spending programmes and restraints on public sector wage
costs.
A Tory Euro MP said yesterday that Britain was proposing a deal at the
summit to waste more than Pounds 500m of taxpayers' money over the next five
years by perpetuating the EC government's 'travelling circus'.
Mr Peter Price, MEP for London South East, said the heads of government
would be invited by the British presidency to endorse a plan to retain the
existing arrangement - a debating chamber in Strasbourg, staff offices for
3,000 in Luxembourg and committee rooms and offices for MEPs in Brussels.

THE prime minister refused to be drawn yesterday on claims by Mr Ken
Livingstone, the leftwing Labour MP, that Mr Jonathan Moyle, a British
journalist, was murdered while investigating alleged links between Mr Mark
Thatcher, son of the former prime minister, and the arms-to-Iraq affair.
Asked during question time for a response to charges that the Chilean judge
investigating the 'murder' was 'obstructed by the unwillingness of British
officials to co-operate,' Mr Major said such allegations should be referred
to 'the proper authorities'.
Mr Livingstone asked: 'Do you think there is any link with the fact that
Jonathan Moyle was investigating the arms trade of Carlos Cardoen, who was
the main arms procurer for Iraq, was responsible for the transmission of
Matrix Churchill equipment to Iraq and was also the business associate of
Mark Thatcher?'

Labour is now broadly satisfied with the private assurances from Mr Dorrell

plans to raise a further point about arrangements for MPs to consider
economic forecasts outside the budget process.

overall funds on such non-training initiatives. Expenditure on training
programmes is to suffer a cut in real terms of 3 per cent.
Running the gauntlet of a string of Labour MPs making interventions on
specific plant closures, Mrs Shephard said the career development loans  -
which are provided by the clearing banks with the government paying interest
until training has been completed - would be available for people in and out
of work.
The government's focus in drawing up its plans was on individuals in
greatest need and measures that had proved themselves successful, she said.
'We will give priority to those measures which help people the most.'
Opening the debate, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, placed his

The Autumn Statement had been 'so feeble' that Ms Shephard and her

Mr Dobson strengthened his plea for a long-term and Europe-wide commitment
to 'aim for full employment', arguing that mass unemployment was a threat
not only to the cohesion of the European Community but to 'democracy
itself'.
'Getting Europe back to work should have been top of the agenda for the
summit in Edinburgh' rather than 'theological' arguments about abstract
concepts like subsidiarity, he said.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Funds pledged for London health services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL funds have been set aside next year to improve health services
in London, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday while
announcing financial allocations to regional health authorities.
The extra money will help introduce the proposals of Sir Bernard Tomlinson's
report into the capital's healthcare. This recommended reducing hospital
beds and developing family doctor and community services.
However, the amount the government intends to commit in 1993-94 will not be
known until the new year, when Mrs Bottomley decides on the Tomlinson
report's recommendations.
Under the overall financial allocations for 1993-94 announced yesterday, the
four Thames regions covering London and the south-east will receive
increases of 0.4 per cent over forecast inflation.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'I understand the
government intend to fund their programme of hospital closures in London by
means of loans from the other regions. This is a cruel trick that Mrs
Bottomley has yet to formally announce.' He added that the government's
figures failed to take into account numerous factors including the rapidly
ageing population.
The government is moving towards allocating health funds based on the size
and demographic characteristics of regional populations. If this formula
applied fully next year, three of the four Thames regions - south-west,
north-east and north-west - would suffer budget cuts of between Pounds 13m
and Pounds 26m.
This reflects the declining population of inner London, a long-term trend
significant in this year's allocation because 1991 census data was used for
the first time.
The biggest funding increases next year will go to the population-growth
regions of Wessex, East Anglia, South-West and Trent. Mrs Bottomley has
allocated a total Pounds 17.5bn to the regions, retaining Pounds 2.66bn for
purposes such as the London restructuring and Aids services.
She also announced that a further 121 hospitals and other services had
expressed interest in becoming self-governing trusts from April 1994. If
most are approved, the drive to local self-management that started with last
year's health reforms will be almost complete.

A fireman surveys the aftermath of a blaze that swept through the West
Bromwich Shree Krishna Hindu Temple in the early hours of yesterday morning
during a spate of attacks on Hindu centres in Birmingham, Bolton, Bradford,
Coventry and Derby, Paul Cheeseright writes.
An emergency meeting of Moslem leaders is being held in London today by the
International Moslems Organisation. It is expected to appeal for calm after
the attacks, which follow the destruction in India of an ancient Moslem
mosque at Ayodhya. The organisation said: 'We don't want the violence to
spread.' Yesterday in the areas where the attacks took place meetings were
held by police and community groups that led to statements of inter-communal
support.
Police appeals for information about men seen close to the temples in West
Bromwich and Coventry before and after the attacks indicated that little is
known about the identity of the culprits. Police said two white men were
seen near the Hindu temple in Harnell Lane, Coventry, around the time it was
attacked, making premature any judgment that this incident was the result of
tension between ethnic minorities.
In the borough of Sandwell, of which West Bromwich is a part, the Indian,
Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities make up more than 10 per cent of the
population of 290,100. There are more than 9,600 Hindus and more than 7,700
Moslems. Damage to the Shree Krishna temple, which was attacked at about
3am, is estimated at millions of pounds. The fire was brought under control
by 70 firemen before the interior of the temple was completely destroyed.
A Hindu temple in Derby was severely damaged but attacks at the Vishwa
temple in Bolton, the Hindu Cultural Centre in Bradford and temples in
Sparkbrook, Birmingham, and in Coventry caused minimal damage.

FT  09 DEC 92 / BR freight customers unite to protest at price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOBBY GROUP representing British Rail's freight customers yesterday warned
that price increases imposed by BR were in danger of driving 2m tonnes of
freight a year - equivalent to 80,000 truckloads - on to the roads.
The newly formed Freight on Rail group said BR's price rises conflicted with
environmental goals and the government's policy of encouraging road freight
to switch to rail.
Freight on Rail, claiming the support of more than 150 companies including
BR freight customers, rail wagon manufacturers and other railway equipment
suppliers, said BR was seeking to increase freight rates by 80 per cent to
120 per cent.
Customers had decided to switch 700,000 tonnes of bulk freight such as
cement and oil to road, the group said, adding that a total of 2m tonnes of
freight a year was in jeopardy. About 90 per cent of conventional container
traffic could also switch to road, it claimed.
Mr Mike Harvey, general manager of CAIB UK, a wagon-leasing group, said the
price rises appeared aimed at reducing BR's freight operations to a
profitable core in readiness for privatisation.
He and other Freight on Rail members feared that lower freight flows would
mean higher costs because overheads would have to be shared.
'We are getting to the stage where you no longer have a critical mass, and
when that critical mass is not there you no longer have a railfreight
industry,' Mr Harvey said.
BR's Trainload Freight subsidiary said it had increased prices only for
traffic which otherwise had no viable future on the railway. 'We are under a
government remit which requires us to operate commercially,' it said. 'We
cannot keep traffic which does not make a positive financial return.'
Continental train operators using Britain's railway tracks after January 1
will pay the same rates as those already agreed for Channel tunnel traffic,
the Department of Transport announced yesterday.
However, the deal will be short-lived because it will be superseded by a
radically different track charging regime due to take effect with rail
privatisation in April 1994.
It will affect little traffic before then because the Channel tunnel is not
due to open until December next year. The only access to Britain for
Continental trains will be by the daily SNCF (French railways) train ferry
from Dover to Dunkirk.
The charges were published yesterday in response to an EC directive
requiring member nations to open their tracks to international passenger and
freight trains from January 1.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Industry gas costs rise by 4.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUEL costs for large industrial gas users have risen 4.2 per cent in the
past year, in spite of British Gas cutting prices to domestic customers.
The increase was the second highest recorded in a survey of international
gas prices by National Utility Services (NUS), the consultancy.
British Gas has raised the price for companies receiving an interruptible
service, meaning they can be cut off at short notice - a service for which
they have traditionally paid very low prices.
Mr Andrew Johns, director of NUS, said: 'Any UK manufacturing company on an
interruptible contract would not be at a competitive advantage compared with
its competitors in the countries we surveyed. In fact it would be at a major
disadvantage.'
The UK ranks sixth out of nine countries when comparing the price charged to
business users. But NUS stressed it is inthe bulk-volume, low-pricesector of
the industrial market - which has not been penetrated by rivals to British
Gas - that prices are rising most rapidly.
By comparison German industrial users have seen their gas costs fall by 22
per cent over the past year. The UK was beaten by Belgium, which raised gas
prices by 5 per cent last year.
Sweden is the most expensive country in gas costs to big users.
Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers Council, who warned on Monday
that big users would face substantial price rises, said the survey 'tends to
confirm the view that some sectors of the industrial market are seeing no
benefit from competition'.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, yesterday said in a speech
marking the sixth anniversary of the company's privatisation that domestic
prices for gas had fallen by more than 20 per cent in real terms since 1986.
At the same time, contract prices (to non-interruptible industrial users)
dropped 25 per cent in real terms.
Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Council, said there was
increasing concern among his members that interruptible gas will become less
available and rise in price.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is to underwrite any extra costs the Northern Ireland Office
faces this year in compensating for terrorist damage in the province. But it
is still resisting any help for insurers on the UK mainland.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, announced yesterday that
he had agreed an 'insurance policy excess'. The Treasury will provide a
back-up if the sums paid out in compensation in Northern Ireland exceed the
amount allocated in his department's budget.
The deal follows the unprecedented freezing of Northern Ireland spending
programmes in the last financial year because of unexpected extra costs of
the compensation scheme.
However, the Treasury said no parallels should be made with the situation on
the mainland where no similar scheme operates - in spite of threats by
insurance companies to withdraw cover for terrorist attacks on commercial
property from next year.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is talking with
insurance companies about possible solutions.
The Treasury said the Northern Ireland agreement was to make clear where the
burden of any extra payout would fall. It added: 'It is not a matter of
generosity. It is a matter of good control of public expenditure.'
In 1991-92, the Northern Ireland Office paid out Pounds 33m in compensation
but the amounts vary considerably from year to year according to the extent
of terrorist attacks. With the IRA now apparently targeting commercial
property, this year's total could be substantially higher. The NIO does not
reveal how much is set aside each year for the scheme.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Cut expected in electricity bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY bills in England and Wales should be reduced slightly from April
as a result of a cut in the Fossil Fuel Levy.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, announced
yesterday that the levy on bills would be cut from 11 per cent to 10 per
cent.
Offer, the office of electricity regulation, estimates that the cut should
reduce the typical household electricity bill by Pounds 2.42 a year.
The levy, introduced in 1990, compensates electricity companies for having
to buy a portion of their power from more expensive sources such as nuclear
and renewables. In 1992-93 the levy will raise about Pounds 1.3bn, virtually
all of which goes to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear power
generator. The levy is due to be phased out by 1998.
Prof Littlechild said the cut represented a downward trend in support for
the nuclear power industry. He also said that in future a larger proportion
of the levy would be paid to renewables such as wind power. A new public
inquiry into British Nuclear Fuels' reprocessing plant at Sellafield could
cost BNF Pounds 100m, Mr John Guinness, BNF chairman, said yesterday,
Bronwen Maddox writes. He said the extra cost would be borne by the taxpayer
because BNF was government-owned. He added that each week's delay in
starting BNF's Thorp reprocessing plant was costing Pounds 2m in related
costs and lost profit.
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental groups, said that
part of Thorp's funding was illegal because the government had broken EC
rules by failing to notify the European Commission of Pounds 2.5bn given to
BNF.

A TOTAL of 120 jobs are to be shed at the Longannet coal-fired power station

The job losses are expected to be on a voluntary basis and will reduce the

secure a long-term future for the power station and for coal-burning power
generation in Scotland.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Scots blockade French trawlers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN yesterday continued their blockade of Lochinver, Sutherland,
against French trawlers.
Fifteen boats were lashed together across the entrance to the harbour. A
large French vessel with engine trouble lay inside the blockade and eight
60-metre French boats were outside the harbour. None tried to beat the
blockade.
The Scottish fishermen are angry about EC rules which allow foreign boats to
land haddock and cod at Lochinver when local vessels cannot because they
have filled their EC fishery quotas.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Delay on issuing fire certificates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of businesses may have to wait years for their applications for
fire certificates to be processed, the National Audit Office, the public
spending watchdog, says in a report published today.
Its study of the effectiveness of Home Office fire prevention activities
says fire brigades had a backlog of 21,000 applications for certificates in
1990, a rise of 30 per cent since 1987. Nearly two thirds of outstanding
applications were in large cities, with the biggest numbers in London, Tyne
and Wear and the West Midlands.
The audit office also says that arrangements for re-inspection are
'unsatisfactory', with a lack of firm guidance from the government. It wants
the Home Office to encourage fire brigades to exempt low-risk premises from
certification and to explore the scope for greater self-regulation by
businesses.
Fire brigades were called to more than 400,000 fires in 1990 compared with
120,000 in 1960. Deaths from fire rose from 430 to 700 a year over the same
period, and insured losses exceeded Pounds 1bn in 1990.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Petrol prices to fall 12p a gallon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum is to cut wholesale petrol prices by up to 13.6p a gallon
 -3p a litre - from midnight tonight, Deborah Hargreaves writes. Jet is to
cut retail prices by 12p to take the price of its unleaded fuel to 199.6p a
gallon.
BP's reduction is believed to be the biggest ever and reflects falling oil
prices and the strengthening of sterling against the dollar. World oil
prices have fallen by almost Dollars 3 a barrel since October.
The price cuts are also a sign of the intense competition in petrol
retailing. Shell, Esso and Texaco say they are monitoring the situation but
have not yet reduced prices.
BP said that some of its stations in highly competitive areas were already
charging prices that reflected the wholesale reduction and would cut prices
even further.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Fimbra row over new watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL ADVISERS yest-erday expressed disquiet about the proposed
formation of the Personal Investment Authority, which would take over the
role of Fimbra, their self-regulatory body.
Many members dissented from the governing council's support for the new
body, intended to merge Fimbra with Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the
life insurance and unit trust industries along with some members of Imro,
the fund managers' body.
The PIA has been proposed because of Fimbra's inability to raise enough
money from members to regulate its area effectively and to make its full
share of contributions to the Investors' Compensation Scheme. Life companies
have capped Fimbra's compensation scheme liabilities in the past two years.
Mr Paul Beard of the Cheshire-based Alexander Beard Group said the
independent status of advisers should be clearly disclosed, adding that the
levy to meet advisers' obligations under the investors' compensation scheme
would put many Fimbra members out of business if the PIA was not accepted.
Mr David Kauders, a Taunton-based fee-charging financial adviser, called on
the council to relate compensation-scheme contributions to capacity to pay
instead of establishing the PIA.
Mr Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, referred to the
'implicit blackmail threat' of the life companies not to cap Fimbra
liabilities for this year unless Fimbra votes for the PIA.
Mr Bryant questioned what he said was a change in Fimbra's accounting policy
last year to treat deferred subscriptions and registration fees in its
balance sheet as capital and reserves rather than creditors.
Sir Gordon Downey, chairman of Fimbra, said this was the most accurate place
for them as they were monies already received and not returnable.
Sir Gordon said the PIA would bring together all those concerned with the
personal investor under one umbrella, enabling 'a level playing field to be
established'.
It provided the opportunity for consistent standards of regulation, which
would help eliminate the confusion caused by a multiplicity of regulators,
said Sir Gordon, who is also chairman of the PIA shadow board.
Banks and building societies have refused to join the PIA, arguing they are
regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, while many say
they do not wish to stand behind the potential liabilities of all financial
advisers.

FT  09 DEC 92 / CBI acts to keep down pay deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry will circulate to members up-to-date
information on recent pay deals and pay freezes in an attempt to strengthen
employers in pay negotiations.
The employers' organisation will write to more than 400 members that have
pay settlements due in January - one of the busiest months for pay deals -
pointing out that the latest three months' rolling average of settlements to
the end of November shows manufacturing pay increases falling below 4 per
cent.
The CBI normally publishes quarterly figures from its databank, but for the
first time this month will start publishing monthly rolling averages.
The organisation, representing companies that employ half the UK's
workforce, said: 'We are anxious that members are aware of how rapidly the
pay situation has changed since the last three quarterly figure when
settlements averaged 4.2 per cent.'
White-collar health service workers yesterday rejected the government's curb
on public-sector pay rises and threatened to ballot on industrial action
next spring when their wage increase is due.
Delegates from the Nalgo union, representing 65,000 administrative and
clerical workers, agreed to submit a claim for a 'substantial rise',
including a 'significant' flat rate increase for the lowest paid. Its claim
will be submitted in the new year with a settlement date of April 1.
The meeting of delegates was the first large public-sector group to gather
since the government announced it wanted to keep public-sector pay increases
within a 1.5 per cent ceiling. Mr Paul Marks, Nalgo's national officer, said
his members had shown that they would not accept being made to pay for the
government's mishandling of the economy.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Fears on jobless training scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN that recently unemployed people who want training in skill shortage
areas are to be denied access to the government's new training and work
experience scheme has been expressed in a report by Full Employment UK, the
consultancy and training company.
The Training for Work scheme, announced last month by Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, will combine Employment Training and Employment
Action, the work experience scheme.
The report, drawn up after consultation with Training and Enterprise
Councils, which administer government-funded training programmes in England
and Wales, broadly welcomed the new scheme. It said the eligibility rules
were relatively wide, but it criticised the exclusion of people who had been
unemployed for less than six months - currently 18 per cent of entrants to
ET.
The report also said that the new Jobplan workshops, which will be run by
the department's Employment Service and which people unemployed for 12
months will have to attend, could be used to dump people on the new scheme.
The level of awareness in the leisure industry of the new national
vocational qualifications is generally poor, a survey of over 70 companies
employing 260,000 people says.
In the survey, conducted by consultant Mrs Janet Salmon between July and
November, 35 per cent of respondents were implementing pilot NVQ programmes
and 24 per cent had plans to introduce them.
But 41 per cent said they did not intend to implement them. Reasons included
the 'prohibitive costs' of certification and claims that existing training
was at a higher, more comprehensive standard.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Analysts warn about council tax levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE council tax bills are likely to be much higher than the government
hopes in spite of more stringent controls on local authority spending,
according to analysts at Robert Fleming Securities, the stockbrokers.
Figures published by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, suggested
that the average council tax bill on a Band D house in England - one valued
at between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000 - would be Pounds 494. Robert
Fleming says it could be as high as Pounds 540 as councils boost spending
above targets set by the government.
The government's suggested local authority spending total for 1993-94 is
less than 1 per cent above what councils expect to spend in 1992-93.
Robert Fleming says that if spending next year is 3 per cent more than the
government's standard spending assessments then the average Band D tax bill
in England would be Pounds 540. While many councils will not be able to
increase spending by as much as 3 per cent, others will be able to increase
it by more than this because their current spending is well below the
standard assessments.
The government is sceptical about the suggestion that overspending will
average 3 per cent more than its assessments. While accepting that there
will be some overspend, it says that the current overspend is less than 3
per cent and the limits on capping budgets for the next financial year are
tighter than for this year.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Recovery is in place, but taking its time: Productivity-led
growth likely for US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWICE in the past two years US economic recoveries have lost momentum in
spite of promising signs of faster growth. It is hardly surprising,
therefore, that president-elect Bill Clinton is treating the latest evidence
of an upturn with caution.
Few forecasters doubt that the US has emerged from recession: gross domestic
product has grown every quarter since the spring of last year. The debate
centres on whether the economy is at last emerging from a prolonged bout of
stagnation that encompassed almost the entire Bush presidency.
Real GDP growth has averaged less than 1 per cent a year since 1989. Even if
the faltering upturn that began in May 1991 is taken as the starting point,
growth has averaged less than 2 per cent, or about a third the pace normal
in the early stages of US recoveries.
Revised figures indicating growth at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the
third quarter and a flurry of encouraging short-term indicators - such as
recent jumps in consumer confidence, factory orders, and the Purchasing
Managers' Index - have prompted speculation that the economy is now moving
up a gear.
Some of the structural drags on growth do seem to be easing. Lower interest
rates and repayment of old debts have reduced the fraction of personal and
corporate income absorbed by debt service, allowing both sectors to spend a
little more freely. Real corporate profits were up by nearly a quarter in
the third quarter relative to the same period last year, reflecting, in
part, faster growth of productivity than wages.
Mr David Hale, chief economist at the Kemper group in Chicago, points out
that bank profitability and capital ratios have also strengthened sharply,
allowing an easing of the 'credit crunch'. There is anecdotal evidence, he
claims, of an upturn in bank loans to small and medium-sized companies - the
sector responsible for the bulk of job creation in the 1980s.
But the improvement is recent and modest; and growth is likely to be
restrained by other structural weaknesses. 'There are too many drags on the
economy for a normal recovery to occur,' say Roger Brinner and David Wyss,
economists at DRI/McGraw Hill, the forecasting group. They fear that defence
cuts will hold back recovery in many regions: defence spending as a share of
federal expenditure is projected to fall from 27 per cent last year to 17
per cent in 1995.
They predict continuing softness of commercial real estate owing to chronic
overbuilding in the 1980s. And, like most other forecasters, they are
pessimistic about US exports, one of the main engines of recent growth.
Demand is slowing in many important markets, including Europe, the Far East
and Mexico.
But with domestic consumption accounting for two-thirds of economic
activity, the spending proclivities of the US consumer will dominate the
economic outlook. In the third quarter, consumer spending grew at an annual
rate of 3.7 per cent, and retailers are predicting a merrier Christmas than
in 1990 or 1991. Yet doubts persist about the sustainability of personal
spending.
The savings rate fell sharply in the third quarter to 4.5 per cent, against
5.3 per cent in the second quarter. A further decline seems improbable.
Consumption will thus be determined by growth of incomes. And the perceived
stumbling here is the continued sluggish pace of job creation.
Last Friday the Labour Department reported the fifth consecutive monthly
decline in the unemployment rate, to 7.2 per cent. Weekly figures for state
unemployment insurance claims have also moved down in recent months.
But most of the fall in unemployment since the summer reflects a contraction
of the labour force rather than new job creation. Private-sector employment
has been roughly flat since the spring of last year, in stark contrast to
previous recoveries.
'The economy is probably still tracking the 1.5-2.5 per cent growth pace of
the past year,' concludes Mr Paul Mastroddi, a senior economist at JP
Morgan, the New York bank.
In keeping with most forecasters, however, he predicts a gradual
acceleration of growth to 3 per cent or more in the second half of next
year.
The possibility of a faster recovery should not be ruled out: once consumer
and business confidence returns, the US economy has a habit of snapping back
faster than expected. But the likeliest prospect is the kind of steady,
productivity-driven recovery experienced by European economies in the 1980s.
In such recoveries, unemployment tends to stay relatively high.
Such a recovery would suit Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, who hopes to make further progress towards stable prices in his
second term. With inflation only just beginning to dip below 3 per cent, the
Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates again and could raise them in the
second half of next year.
For Mr Clinton's economic team, however, the figures pose a dilemma. The
recovery is strong enough to make anything more than a token fiscal stimulus
next year look risky. Yet it may be too sluggish to convince most Americans
that he has turned the economy around. How Mr Clinton resolves this dilemma
will be the first big economic test of his presidency.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Hungary buys US military hardware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST, ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has agreed to supply military hardware to bolster Hungary's air
defences following repeated breaches by jets from neighbouring Yugoslavia.
The arms sale, the first by the US to a former Warsaw Pact nation, involves
'identification-friend-or-foe' (IFF) equipment and is worth Dollars 12.9m
(Pounds 8.4m). Under the deal US suppliers will deliver four ground-based
radar stations and electronics for 118 military aircraft.
The equipment will allow the Hungarian air force to leave the IFF system
inherited from the communist Warsaw Pact and to distinguish the country's
own planes from those of former allies.
Hungary's need for firmer air defences became apparent a year ago when war
in Yugoslavia spilled over the border and a series of territorial violations
culminated in Yugoslav aircraft bombing the southern Hungarian town of
Barcs.
The agreement also demonstrates Hungary's success in establishing close
security ties with Washington in advance of eventual membership of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Budapest's goal.
The purchase from the US comes within a month of deals for military spare
parts from Germany and Russia.
Hungary maintains its military acquisitions are defensive and do not change
the regional balance of power, which remains strongly in favour of the
country's neighbours.
Sikorsky, the US-based helicopter manufacturer, yesterday signed a Dollars
1.1bn deal with Turkey for the sale and co-production of Black Hawk
helicopters, AP reports from Ankara.
Sikorsky will deliver 45 helicopters to Turkey in nine months, and a further
50 helicopters will be co-produced in Turkey over four years.
Turkey, which has been stepping up efforts to modernise its military, will
also receive 50 A-10 fighter aircraft and 100 Cobra helicopters from the US
over the next five years.

FT  09 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japanese investors forced to watch bottom
line - Yield is guiding funds abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European and US companies still agonising over that first, tentative
investment in Thailand or Malaysia have been left far behind by Mr Toshihiko
Sekimoto, Asian general manager at Itochu, the Japanese trading house.
'We may be reducing our projects in Thailand. We have found it difficult to
transfer technology and know-how to our Thai factories. We are very
interested in Vietnam. India could be interesting,' Mr Sekimoto says.
His comments reflect the changing emphasis of Japanese foreign direct
investment, often motivated by a ill-defined desire for expansion or in the
hope of reducing trade friction and elevating the corporate profile. Now,
earnings are falling at home, capital costs are rising, and the stress is on
profitability.
These changed circumstances are behind a 27 per cent fall in investment last
fiscal year and a further 12 per cent in the first half this year. Companies
are reviewing locations and project types - the US and continental Europe
are out of favour, developers are selling not buying property, and
manufacturers' priority is cheaper production of or assembly of components.
Figures compiled by the ministry of international trade and industry show
that the average return on sales for Japanese investment projects in Asia
has been 3 per cent and in Europe 1 per cent, while investments in the US
are showing a return of -0.1 per cent.
For manufacturing projects, Asia is showing a 5 per cent return, Europe 3.2
per cent and the US -0.9 per cent.
Poor yields on foreign investment could be easily tolerated in the late
1980s, when sales were surging at home, and the gravity-defying Tokyo stock
market provided funds at close to zero cost and allowed companies to
supplement core earnings with quick profits on stock sales.
However, Nikko Research estimates that manufacturers' operating profit
margin this year will average 3.1 per cent, down from the previous lows of
3.2 per cent in 1986, post-Plaza Accord (which caused a sharp rise in the
value of the yen), and the oil shock-affected 4.5 per cent in 1975.
One side-effect of the 'bubble era' was an expansion of investment within
Japan by the electronics, machine tool, and car industries, which have
suffered some of the largest falls in profit over the past year and are
under extreme pressure to relocate facilities in lower-cost countries.
Mr Yuji Hosoya, deputy director of international business at Miti's
industrial policy bureau, says the erosion of core profits has forced
manufacturers into 'survival' investment elsewhere in Asia. That trend can
be seen in the jump in Chinese projects from 165 in 1990 to 246 last fiscal
year. Over the same period, Asian countries' share of new Japanese direct
investment rose from 12.4 per cent to 14.3 per cent, the US share declined
from 45.9 per cent to 43.3 per cent, and Europe from 25.1 per cent to 22.5
per cent - the UK share fell from 12 per cent to 8.6 per cent.
The pace of change has quickened markedly this year. Investment in China is
likely to double from the Dollars 579m of 1991, while investment in
continental Europe is expected to be about 30 per cent lower, with a smaller
decline in the UK. Asia is generally an increasingly popular site for new
projects, but companies are more strategic in choosing a site for
investment, and no longer motivated by the desire for a factory in every
country.
In emphasising the need for better returns, Mr Sekimoto explains that Itochu
has a textile spinning mill in Thailand and another in Vietnam. The Thai
plant has about 2,000 local employees and requires 22 Japanese specialists,
while the Vietnamese plant has 1,700 staff and no permanent Japanese
managers, but is 2.5 times larger than the Thai factory.
He says lower salaries in Vietnam add to the attraction of that country as
an investment site: 'A monthly salary in Thailand is between Dollars 70 and
Dollars 80, but in Vietnam it is Dollars 20. The Vietnamese are twice as
productive, which makes them eight times cheaper than Thai workers.'
Japanese companies are keen on China because of increasing access to the
flourishing domestic market and because it is suitable low-cost centre for
assembly or components production for the international market. They are not
rushing to sign contracts in Hanoi, as concerns remain about infrastructure
and legal protection, but Vietnam will experience a long-term increase in
investment while the flow of money slows to other countries.
The resumption of Japan's official development assistance to Vietnam last
month provided extra encouragement to investors.
Mr Sekimoto provided another clue to the future flow of Japanese funds in
Asia. He has devised a rough scale of worker productivity, based on his
experience with projects in the region - Indonesia and Malaysia are at the
bottom, rating a 1, India and Sri Lanka 1.5, Thailand 2, Japan and China 3,
Korea 3.5, and Vietnam 4.
'One thing I found in Bangkok is that some workers would leave us after only
a year and boast that they had been trained by a genuine Japanese company.
It is important that workers want to go on learning,' he said. 'If you go to
Vietnam, there are a lot of book shops. They are always wanting to learn.'

FT  09 DEC 92 / Democrats to grant president long honeymoon on the Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC congressmen yesterday predicted a 'long honeymoon' for Governor
Bill Clinton after a morning meeting with the president-elect on Capitol
Hill.
'Democrats on the Hill are starved for someone to get along with at the
White House. Bill Clinton's going to find no stubbornness up here,' said
Congressman Pat Williams of Montana.
But Republicans promised confrontation with the incoming president,
signalling their intentions by ousting the moderate Congressman Jerry Lewis
of California from chairmanship of the House of Representatives Republican
Conference, the party's third-ranking leadership position, in favour of
Congressman Richard Armey of Texas, a more pugnacious right winger.
Mr Clinton has already held a series of meetings with leaders of both
parties in Congress as well as with the 110 first-time members, who some
have likened to the independent and reform-minded group of congressmen
elected in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal.
The 'freshmen' have made their presence felt by interviewing committee
chairmen seeking re-election, a tactic last adopted by the Watergate class.
But early results from party caucus elections suggest that only minor cracks
are likely to emerge in the traditional congressional power structure, where
seniority counts for almost everything.
True, 82-year-old Congressman Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, who can trump
anyone on seniority by virtue of 51 years' continuous service, was ousted
from the chairmanship of the highly influential appropriations committee.
But Mr Whitten will be replaced by Congressman Bill Natcher of Kentucky, who
at 83 is even older, but healthier.
Most other committee chairs appear safe, although a battle is brewing for
chairmanship of the budget committee, which would fall open if, as many
expect, Congressman Leon Panetta is named director of the Office of
Management and Budget.
The race is expected to pit Mr Charles Stenholm, a fiscal conservative from
Texas, against the more left wing Mr Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, with Mr
John Spratt of South Carolina somewhere in the middle.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Brazil to act over surge in kidnaps

IN AN attempt to crack down on a new wave of kidnappings in Rio de Janeiro,
the Brazilian Congress is to vote this week on a project to freeze the
assets of captives' families.
An Interpol conference last week said Rio was becoming the world centre of
kidnapping. The city has a record number of 10 people in captivity, two of
whom have been held for two months, while 146 cases have been registered
this year.
Mr Mauricio Correa, the law minister, admits: 'It's like a raging epidemic.'
Multinationals, such as Land Rover, planning to invest in Brazil are
bypassing Rio as unsafe. The head of one foreign bank in Sao Paulo said:
'Five years ago we couldn't get people to move from Rio. Now, no one wants
to stay.'
Victims are usually leading businessmen or socialites, or their relations,
with the real number of kidnappings believed to be far higher than the 360
registered in the last three years. Many are not reported for fear of a
repeat.
The kidnappers are well armed, with imported weapons and cellular
telephones, and are controlled by the Red Command, the city's main organised
crime gang. Evidence is also emerging of police involvement.
Mr Sergio Quintella, a local businessman whose son was released last week on
a Dollars 330,000 ransom after 49 days in captivity, has made a public
appeal for people to come forward with information.
Some victims are starting legal action against the Rio state government for
'omission', but Mr Nilo Batista, the state security secretary, said:
'Kidnapping is one of the hardest crimes to prevent. In Italy it took 10
years to bring under control.'
It is increasingly common to see local business people accompanied by
security guards and driving battered vehicles, leaving smart cars in the
garage.

FT  09 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japanese tips for chip makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first Japanese trade mission to Europe of semiconductor users has
arrived in Paris to teach European microchip manufacturers a few tricks on
how to sell their goods in the fiercely competitive Japanese market.
'I believe the Japanese semiconductor market is open and freely accessible,'
said Mr Nobuo Kanoi, executive deputy president of Sony, the Japanese
consumer electronics and entertainment group, who is heading the mission.
Poor communication has meant Europeans are not well enough informed of
Japanese market needs while the Japanese often do not know what Europe has
to offer.
Europe's share of the Japanese chip market is estimated at between 1-3 per
cent. This compares with about 16 per cent of the European market held by
Japanese companies, according to Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy.
As well as insufficient information about what Japanese users require,
European suppliers are hampered by a lack of recognition in Japan. They also
need to meet Japanese standards in terms of delivery and after-sales
service.
For example, Sony has difficulty obtaining European components for
miniaturised consumer electronics products, such as the Walkman, which are
key Sony products, said Mr Klaus Wangerin, general manager of European
procurement at Sony Europe.
Mr Ernie Pusey, sales and marketing director of GEC Plessey Semiconductors,
the UK company, believes the secret of success in Japan 'is having Japanese
people on the ground employed by your company'. Engineers who speak Japanese
are crucial.
Having unique products also helps. GEC, which manufactures specialised
rather than commodity products, has seen sales in Japan double to about 4
per cent of total turnover and expects the same in the current year.
So far there is no official target for European market share in Japan,
although an unofficial figure of 5 per cent is talked about.

<TEXT>
FRANCE is planning to increase its development aid budget to help stimulate
third world markets, Mr Michel Sapin, its finance minister, said yesterday.
By the end of the decade annual aid spending would be raised from last
year's 0.56 per cent of gross domestic product, or FFr30bn (Pounds 3.64bn),
to 0.7 per cent, he told a meeting of advisers from the Direction des
Relations Economiques Exterieures, the state foreign trade board.
Its current aid budget, which has risen by 6 per cent a year over the past
decade, is already well above the 0.31 per cent average for the Group of
Seven richest industrialised nations. 'We are aiming to ensure durable
development in these countries,' he said.
At the same time Mr Sapin recognised that budget constraints would oblige
France to be more selective in channelling aid. Concessional finance would
be limited to the poorest countries. Sales to other markets would be offered
export credit insurance through the Coface state organisation according to
those countries' risk premiums.
Mr Sapin was speaking on the second of a five-day gathering of the trade
board's 172 foreign-based economic councillors, called as part of a campaign
to improve its sensitivity to the needs of French exporters and companies
planning foreign investments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE announcing the restart of the Multilateral Steel Agreement talks - in
Geneva today - US trade officials have steadfastly denied any connection
with the 84 dumping and subsidy cases filed by the nation's steel industry.
They say they want to break the cycle of trade cases and restraint
agreements, but to do so they must provide effective disciplines on trade
distortions. The MSA talks are to deal with future dumping and subsidies,
while the steel cases are considered protection against uncompetitive
practices.
When the talks broke down on March 31, the negotiators had generally agreed
on phasing out tariffs over a 10-year period, prohibiting non-tariff
barriers and setting up a mechanism for settling disputes.
However, the talks foundered on the EC's wish that subsidies be allowed to
continue for research and possibly for development, plant closure, workers'
assistance and environmental compliance. The US also refused to give advance
notification before unfair trade cases were filed.
Breakdown coincided with the end of seven and a half years of quota
protection for the US industry, leaving it free to pursue unfair trade
complaints. Many analysts expect demands from foreign governments for
further political 'suspension agreements' - resulting in market-sharing of
sorts in exchange for the dropping of the unfair trade cases - after the
Commerce Department announces steep dumping margins next month.
Steel producers insist they will follow the cases to their conclusion and
will not be pushed into accepting a deal.
The International Trade Commission, which must find evidence of injury
before anti-dumping and countervailing duties are made permanent, cannot be
relied on for support.
US steel prices are very depressed, but the cause could be attributed to the
recession and over-supply rather than foreign steel. It is not impossible
that, under pressure from a new administration, the industry will agree to
quotas, providing price floors are built in.

INDIAN businessmen fear that the crisis sparked by the destruction of a
mosque at Ayodhya by Hindu militants could harm the economy if the
government does not rapidly move to restore stability.
They fear that the riots, curfews and strikes which have followed Sunday's
assault on the mosque will damage business confidence and jeopardise the
reform programme of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister.
They said much would depend on how quickly order was restored. 'The next two
days are vital,' said Mr V. Raghuraman, secretary general of the
Assoc-iation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
Finance Ministry officials also acknowledged the crisis could affect
sentiment if it were allowed to drag on. The mood was particularly bleak in
Bombay, which has borne the brunt of the riots. Many offices in the city
were closed yesterday after disturbances in which at least 50 people were
killed.
The incident was already having an effect on business life: Hindustan
Aluminium, an aluminium producer, postponed the pricing of a planned Dollars
100m Euro-equity issue because the Bombay stock market was closed so no
price quotations were available.
Stockbrokers prepared for a sharp drop in share prices today, the first day
the market is due to open since the mosque's destruction. Hotels reported
many cancellations. Mr Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata group, India's
largest company, said from his Bombay office: 'The world is going to look at
India as an unstable country. Political stability is one of the main
considerations governing foreign investment.'
Mr Nimesh Kampani, head of J M Financial and Investment Services, an
investment broking company, said the incident would probably affect India's
international credit rating - and make it more difficult for Indian
companies to raise funds overseas.
In Calcutta, Mr Mumtaz Ahmed, a spokesman for the Bengal Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, said: 'Foreign investors don't just look for favourable
government policies. They watch the situation on the ground. Foreigners will
be in no hurry to invest after the Ayodhya incident. We tend to forget that
India is just one of many investment options available to foreign
investors.'
Mr Jahar Sengupta, chairman of ICI India, an affiliate of the UK chemicals
combine, was less glum. He forecast that there would be a serious setback in
foreign investment in India only if Mr Rao's government falls - an event
which yesterday seemed unlikely.
Mr Ashok Desai, the the Finance Ministry's chief economic adviser, said the
main impact of the crisis on foreign investment would be on portfolio
investment. Businessmen who knew India well and were considering specific
direct investments would not be so easily put off. Mr Manmohan Singh, the
finance minister, who is in Washington, said yesterday that now that the
liberalisation measures 'are seen to work, the reforms can only go forward'.
The mosque's destruction has held up government business, including economic
policymaking, with ministerial timetables cleared of routine work to make
room for considering the crisis. The parliamentary committee probing the
Bombay securities market scandal has postponed its meetings. If they are not
resumed soon, that will delay MPs' final report which is expected to contain
firm recommendations about financial reform.
Without those recommendations, the finance ministry may have to delay its
financial deregulation programme, including measures essential to further
economic liberalisation.

<TEXT>
COLONEL Omar Jess, the Somali warlord who controls the wild southern city of
Kismayo, turned to face the Indian ocean yesterday at the deserted port and
gazed towards the horizon - perhaps looking for a first sighting of the
French and US ships which started disembarking troops before dawn today.
Col Jess, leader of the battle-hardened Ogadeni clan-faction, is the only
man who can offer safe passage into Somalia's second largest port, a key
objective of the US-led military intervention. 'We want the US soldiers to
come because there is anarchy and chaos in the country, there is looting and
gangs and warmongers,' said the colonel, leaning against a Land Rover armed
with a mounted multiple grenade launcher adapted from a MiG-23 fighter jet.
The port and airport at Kismayo are vital to transport food up the Jubba
Valley where the people are suffering the worst starvation.
If foreign troops encounter violence it is most likely to be in Kismayo
where at least four clans are battling for control of the town's scant
resources.
Mr Sean Devereux, a Unicef official in Kismayo, says: 'Somalis in Kismayo
have been used to localised power and they have seen what the gun can do and
what power it can bring.'
The United Nations had to evacuate Kismayo in October because of looting,
hijacking of aid planes, intimidation and death threats against UN aid
workers. Several ships have been looted while docked. In the last food
shipment, only 20 per cent reached the most severely affected starving
people. The rest of the trucks controlled by the local 'authorities' were
'diverted'.
'Jess cannot control the men with guns who do what they want and take every
opportunity to grab and take,' says Mr Devereux.
Col Jess said he had done as much as possible to get food to his people. He
did not get a cut from the looting, only a 'few taxes' collected by local
authorities under his control.
'The UN have destabilised Somalia, refused to help us and committed crimes
which must be investigated and punished,' he said. He also warned he would
fiercely resist efforts to turn Somalia into a UN trusteeship. 'We will
fight anybody who wants to colonise us again. We want to be independent and
free.'
Like other warlords Col Jess says he will welcome troops but expects them to
entrench the position he has established by force. He expects US troops to
disarm the bandits, feed the starving, develop the country and then get out
and give him his slice of power back.
As soon as this illusion fades he, like the others, will become less
welcoming.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Pretoria cancels talks with PAC after murders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SOUTH African government said yesterday it was cancelling planned talks
with the ultra-radical Pan Africanist Congress and would hold no further
negotiations with the group until it distanced itself from attacks carried
out by its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla).
Yesterday the PAC further enraged the government, which is under pressure
from its white supporters to take a tough line on racial violence, by
defending Apla, which has claimed two attacks on white civilians over the
past 10 days. Five people have died.
Orde Boerevolk (Order of the Afrikaans People), a white splinter group, said
it would bomb black taxi ranks in retaliation. Other white right-wing
groups, most small but with former and serving security force officers among
their members, also threatened vengeance.
The Conservative party, the largest white opposition group, asked its
supporters to report to their nearest CP office to help counter the Apla
threat.
Tour operators said publicity over the attacks, notably in the UK, had
prompted some to cancel Christmas holidays.
White South Africans have been shocked by Apla statements declaring war on
whites - despite the fact that, in a country with one of the highest murder
rates in the world, the risk of falling victim to racist terrorism is small.
In the past, political commentators have tended to dismiss the PAC, which
waged a guerrilla war from exile for more than 30 years until it was
unbanned in 1990, but can claim few previous attacks on military or civilian
targets.
But they point out that the African National Congress's decision to enter
negotiations with the government has alienated some radical black youths,
and has probably boosted PAC membership. Although a recent opinion poll put
this at only 3 per cent nationwide, the organisation has recently struck a
chord with radical township youths by condemning the white reaction to
Apla's attacks: the PAC argues, not without foundation, that whites ignore
thousands of black deaths and react only when whites also die.
The PAC army has established bases in the Transkei black 'homeland', where
three out of five members of the ruling Military Council are understood to
be PAC sympathisers.
Ironically, one effect has been to cement the improving relationship between
the ANC and the government, which are negotiating to rule South Africa by
coalition in the transition to full democracy. In the face of PAC leaders
defending their slogan 'one settler one bullet', the ANC, which has
condemned the attacks, appears more moderate.
The Apla campaign - even if it claims no further victims - is likely to
undermine progress in constitutional negotiations. The government had
succeeded in recent months in persuading the PAC to join talks on a new
constitution, but PAC officials have now said they will no longer
participate in talks, or in an interim government.

FT  09 DEC 92 / The activist and the tycoon in tussle for South Korea
presidency: Two very different sons of the nation want to be the first
opposition candidate to win office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By JOHN BURTON and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Mr Kim Dae-jung was being imprisoned by South Korea's former military
dictatorship, Mr Chung Ju-yung was building the country's largest corporate
empire with the help of subsidised government loans.
Now both want to become the first opposition candidate to win the
presidency. In spite of their contrasting backgrounds, their platforms for
the December 18 elections are strikingly similar, especially on opening up
the flagging economy.
Mr Kim, the 67-year-old democracy campaigner, has his best chance of gaining
the prize he sought in 1971 and 1987. He was repeatedly jailed and exiled
during three decades of struggle against the military regime.
He survived assassination attempts, was kidnapped from Japan by the Korean
Central Intelligence Agency in 1973 and had a death sentence commuted at the
last minute in 1981.
His fate in the elections depends largely on the number of votes captured
from the government by the populist, Ross Perot-style campaign of Mr Chung,
founder of the Hyundai industrial group.
The gruff 77-year-old, who rises at 3am each day and walks to work
surrounded by a gaggle of his sons, is a former construction worker and
truck driver who built Hyundai over some 45 years into Korea's biggest
chaebol, or family-owned conglomerate. He entered politics last year in
frustration at attempts by the government to restrict the activities of
groups such as his.
Mr Chung's gain in popularity has raised the possibility that he could win
enough votes from Mr Kim Young-sam, the ruling party candidate, to give
victory to Mr Kim Dae-jung. There is even speculation that Mr Chung could
win.
Mr Kim Dae-jung is taking two views of the official investigation launched
this week of alleged secret funding by Hyundai of the United People's Party
 -charges which Hyundai and the UPP deny.
On the one hand, he is dismissive of Mr Chung's candidacy. In an interview
on his campaign bus, he said Mr Chung's career had not contributed to the
development of democracy and that his candidacy had corrupted politics. Mr
Chung, he said, 'has not been able to distinguish between the corporation
and politics'.
'He is using all his employees and even his subcontractors as party members
. . . . He is promoting money politics in the election.'
But Mr Kim is also calling for fairness in the supervision of the elections.
He says the ruling Democratic Liberal party is also guilty of violations and
that the government probe is a biased attempt to prevent him from winning.
The government insists it is neutral.
Though there are similarities between the platforms of the three main
candidates - they all promise deregulation of the economy to boost flagging
growth - Mr Kim Dae-jung is emphasising improvements in social welfare and a
reduction of regional divisions within South Korea, as well as improving the
popular image of bickering, ineffective politicians. He says he would offer
10 out of 26 ministerial positions to the other main parties.
He wants a phased, peaceful re-unification with North Korea and sees foreign
policy continuing to be based on a close relationship with the US, with
Washington remaining as the stabilising influence in east Asia.
Mr Kim suffers from a perception among voters that he is too old a face and,
because of his struggles with the military, that he has radical
anti-establishment views. This is despite attempts to re-model his image and
his clear espousal of free-market economic policies. He argues that his
close association with the trade union movement would help him reduce the
industrial strife which has convulsed Korean industry since democratic
reforms five years ago.
By contrast, Mr Chung's non-political career and his success in business
appear to be winning him votes. To many Koreans, he personifies the
country's rags-to-riches story. Because of his huge fortune - he says it is
Dollars 4bn - they feel that he is unlikely to become enmeshed in the
corruption which pervades Korea's political system.
Calling himself the 'economic president', Mr Chung strikes a chord with his
promises of very rapid economic growth, low inflation, projects to improve
infrastructure, low housing rents and rapid deregulation.
'I would like to reduce government control and leave everything in the hands
of the marketplace,' he said in an interview.
Perhaps what is most surprising, he plans to eliminate the economic system
on the back of which he and Hyundai prospered. He would stop cheap loans to
the chaebol and break them into more autonomous units to achieve greater
efficiency.
'When the country was small, we needed to combine together to compete
against larger companies. Now we need to break them up in order to achieve
international competitiveness.'
Mr Kim Dae-jung, like many politicians, dismisses Mr Chung's rough-and-ready
prescriptions and bold promises as 'baseless'. But there is no doubt that
they are exciting voters who profess disillusionment with the political
process and yearn for strong leadership. If one of the opposition candidates
wins, his challenge will be not only to spearhead economic development, but
also to build greater faith in democracy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China yesterday began three days of talks on the future of Hong
Kong and devoted the first session to a recitation of known positions about
proposals made by Governor Chris Patten for more democracy in the colony.
China urged Britain to withdraw the governor's proposals and abide by the
1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law - the
mini-constitution drafted by Beijing for Hong Kong when it reverts to
Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Mr Tony Galsworthy, Britain's representative, again offered China talks on
the proposals which envisage a broadening of the franchise in elections due
in 1995.
The latest round of talks is the 25th to be held by the Joint Liaison Group
which was set up, in accordance with the Joint Declaration, to oversee
orderly transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China. British officials do
not expect much progress to be made this week.
Mr Patten's proposals initially won widespread support in Hong Kong. That
support, however, has weakened in the face of a concerted campaign by China
to discredit the governor, and local concerns about Mr Patten's style of
leadership.
Yesterday's Economic Journal, Hong Kong's leading financial daily, carried
an editorial that was very critical of the governor's style.
George Graham adds from Washington: US President-elect Bill Clinton said
yesterday he was 'very concerned' about the mounting tension between China
and the UK over the future of Hong Kong, and hoped the US could play a 'very
constructive role in relieving those tensions.'
'I think it is clear from the activities in China in the last few years that
the Chinese desperately want to maintain the economic engine of Hong Kong. I
hope they understand they really can't maintain it unless they also maintain
a large range of personal freedom, liberty and human rights,' he told a
meeting of media executives in Washington yesterday.
Mr Clinton, who during his election campaign criticised President George
Bush for taking too gentle an attitude to Chinese human rights abuses, said
he might want to say more on the subject after he enters the White House.

<TEXT>
ZAMBIA has liberalised its foreign exchange regime by merging the official
and free market rates, before a meeting with donors in Paris on Friday.
As a result, the official rate has been devalued 29 per cent from 248 kwacha
to the dollar to K320. Before the move, announced on Monday night by the
Bank of Zambia, the stronger official rate had applied to copper exports,
accounting for 90 per cent of total foreign earnings, as well as to official
payments abroad for debt service, fuel imports and other key imports such as
fertiliser.
Since the Movement for Multi Party Democracy (MMD) government was elected 13
months ago, the foreign exchange market has been substantially deregulated.
Zambians can buy up to Dollars 6,000 per transaction at bureaux de change to
pay for imports, service payments and foreign travel, with no limit on the
number of transactions and no documentation required.
The effective devaluation of the official rate will boost the domestic
currency earnings of the government-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
and will also have a favourable impact on government revenue. But costs and
prices will be adversely affected, temporarily exacerbating inflation
currently running at more than 100 per cent.
Officials are confident, however, that the worst of the inflationary spiral
is over and that inflation will slow to 20 per cent by the final quarter of
1993.

BRUTAL and sometimes fatal torture has become endemic in Chinese jails in
the past 10 years, although the country's law forbids it and China has
ratified the UN convention against it, Amnesty International reports today.
Amnesty says continued campaigns to crush crime and political opposition
have fuelled human rights violations, including arbitrary detention,
executions and torture. Its report details dozens of cases, some involving
women and children, beaten, shackled for months on end, given electric
shocks, and kept in dark cells too small to stand up or lie down in.
Amnesty says: 'We believe the law enforcement and justice system in China
actually foster torture'. Prisoners have few rights. Many are abused into
confessions. Amnesty accuses China of failing to provide basic safeguards to
protect prisoners. Many are held with no right of access to lawyers, and at
the mercy of police and guards.
China says it follows up cases of torture. A British human rights delegation
was told last week that 400 cases of torture were investigated in 1991,
leading to penalties against the torturers. Amnesty cites the same figure,
which it believes represents only a fraction of the real number of cases. It
urges China to protect prisoners and end the impunity many prison guards
enjoy.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Yeltsin twists again in effort to save Gaidar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday offered a power-sharing
deal and a further ministerial sacrifice in an effort to persuade the
Russian Congress of People's Deputies to approve the reappointment of Mr
Yegor Gaidar as prime minister.
A vote on Mr Gaidar, at present the acting prime minister and sole candidate
for the post, is expected today.
Mr Yeltsin's latest concessions to the middle ground in Congress mean the
outcome of the vote is likely to be very close.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, a deputy prime minister, said last night that Mr
Yeltsin would nominate Mr Gaidar a second time if turned down by the
Congress today - and that he could legally sustain him in office for a
further three months without the deputies' agreement.
His comments reflected what has become a widespread belief that the
government will, one way or another, survive until April next year - after
which, he said, 'a new government' could find the economic situation easier.
Mr Yeltsin yesterday recommended Mr Gaidar to the deputies as a man of
courage, of devotion to the cause of reform and - to cynical laughter -
'just smart'.
The president also proposed that the Supreme Soviet, or smaller permanent
parliament, be given the right of veto over the appointment of four
ministers - defence, security, interior affairs and foreign affairs, the
so-called 'power block'.
Such an arrangement would probably seal the fate of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the
liberal foreign minister, whose pro-western sentiments and perceived
indifference to the fate of Russians in other former Soviet republics have
angered conservative and centrist deputies. However, as a constitutional
change this move would need a two-thirds majority. The signs were yesterday
that it would be unlikely to obtain such a vote.
Several faction leaders, who met Mr Yeltsin before the session, said that
they would not vote for the deal because it did not include the key economic
ministries. They also said they were unlikely to vote for Mr Gaidar.
Mr Vassily Lipitsky, a leader of the Civic Union bloc which has been
negotiating with the president over economic reform and the government, said
yesterday he 'could not see a majority' - a minimum of 521 - for Mr Gaidar.
Mr Oleg Plotnikov, the co-ordinator of the 'Smena' centrist faction in
Congress said that 'whatever I think about Gaidar, I know that the people
who elected me in Kostorma would hate it if I voted for him. He is very
unpopular in the countryside, especially where they haven't seen anything
good from the economic reforms'.
If not confirmed today, Mr Gaidar may still live on as acting prime minister
until the next Congress is convened in April - under a clause in the
constitution which allows the president to appoint his choice as premier for
three months before submitting a new candidate.
Mr Yeltsin's offer, and the apparent willingness to sacrifice a foreign
minister, marks the intensity of the struggle between the president and the
parliament on the government's policies and personnel.
However, his concessions to the middle ground means that the vote to confirm
Mr Gaidar today is likely to be a cliffhanger.

INTERNATIONAL mediators yesterday failed to get Bosnia's Moslem-led
government to talk to Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, agencies
report from Geneva.
Diplomats said Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the Geneva
conference on the former Yugoslavia, had asked Mr Haris Silajdzic, the
Bosnian foreign minister, to meet the rebel Serb chief, but Mr Silajdzic,
and Croat leader Mate Boban, both refused to hold direct negotiations with
Mr Karadzic to discuss maps showing their visions for the future shape of
Bosnia.
Renewed fighting on the ground yesterday, especially around the Bosnian
capital of Sarajevo, made real progress virtually impossible in Geneva.
Fierce fighting broke out in Sarajevo yesterday, effectively cutting it off
from the outside world after clashes closed the main road to the airport and
the only other route into the capital from Serb-held Ilidza.
Serbs besieging Sarajevo yesterday offered free passage out to anyone
wishing to leave the city to avoid famine and cold.

GREEK companies are systematically breaking the United Nations trade embargo
against Serbia, sending thousands of tonnes of oil to the former Yugoslavia,
EC officials said yesterday.
Operators based in Greece are sending oil by road and rail via Romania and
Bulgaria, undermining UN efforts to curb Serbian aggression through a tight
trade ban, the official said.
Mr Abel Matutes, the Spanish European Commissioner responsible for
Mediterranean affairs, laid out the sanctions-busting dossier during a
meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.
Mr Matutes said up to two trains a day were leaving Greece for Romania
carrying an estimated 1,000 tonnes a day. Several thousand tonnes more a
week were being ferried by lorry from Greece to Bulgaria.
Mr Matutes said he was not accusing the Greek government of sanctions
busting, since private operators were involved. However EC diplomats said
the Greek foreign minister was embarrassed by the presentation.
The Greek representative told the meeting his country could not control the
operations of private companies with genuine documents showing oil being
shipped to another destination.
Greece has denied systematic violation of the sanctions and said it was
investigating specific cases when Greek-operated vessels delivering oil were
observed by western naval patrols.
The details of sanctions busting come amid continuing Greek efforts to halt
petrol supplies to the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Greece refuses
to recognise the republic because of a dispute over the use of the name
Macedonia. There is a Greek province named Macedonia.
Greece however recently agreed to release 21,000 tonnes of oil being held at
Salonika to go to Macedonia. But it is still holding around 60,000 tonnes
ordered by Macedonia last summer.
The UK presidency of the EC is trying to overcome Greek opposition to
recognition of Macedonia and wants to avoid a row with the fragile Athens
government before the Edinburgh summit.
EC officials said yesterday that said there had been a serious breakdown of
discipline among UN peacekeeping forces involving Russian, Ukrainian and
Kenyan troops fraternising with Serbs.
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary intends to raise the matter
with senior UN officials.
An EC official said the incident could encourage Croatia's President Franjo
Tudjman to carry out his longstanding threat to oppose an extension of the
United Nations peacekeeping mandate in Croatia beyond March 1.

FT  09 DEC 92 / WEU urged to intervene in Bosnia conflict
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN European countries should take more effective military measures to
deal with the Bosnian crisis, Mr Wim Van Eekelen, secretary-general of the
Western European Union, said yesterday.
The measures should include establishment of 'safe havens' for the Moslem
population of Bosnia, as western allies had done for Kurds in northern Iraq,
and the provision of military air cover for aid convoys.
At a final press conference in London before the 10-nation defence
organisation moves its headquarters to Brussels next month, Mr Van Eekelen
said the UN operation in Bosnia had probably reached its limits, as far as
peace-keeping was concerned.
He did not think either China or Russia would agree to UN military
involvement in Bosnia beyond its present task of providing protection for
humanitarian aid convoys. That was why he believed the European countries
should take a lead, if necessary outside the UN context.
Mr van Eekelen recognised the reluctance of all countries to become heavily
engaged with ground forces in the former Yugoslavia. But the European
countries should set themselves more limited objectives and then make sure
that they were attained, which was not the case at present. 'Military
measures are sometimes necessary to achieve political objectives,' he said.
'Our credibility is zero politically because we are just not doing
anything.'
Mr van Eekelen said that while the joint Nato-WEU naval blockade in the
Adriatic had been successful in preventing supplies reaching Serbia and
Montenegro by sea, much tighter controls had to be imposed to prevent
sanctions-busting on the Danube.
Aircraft should be provided to protect aid convoys and should be authorised
to fire back if a convoy was attacked or remove obstacles in its way.
Mr van Eekelen said a more dynamic and independent European defence posture
was necessary with the withdrawal of US troops from Europe.
Though he hoped some American forces would stay, the only chance of
preserving Nato as a viable organisation was to transform it into a genuine
two-pillar alliance. It was no longer just a question of burden-sharing, but
of a more equal partnership.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community central bank governors yesterday elected Mr Wim
Duisenberg, head of the Dutch central bank, as the chairman to take them
further down the road towards monetary union, Reuter reports from Basle.
The EC bank governors' committee, viewed as the embryo of a future EC
central bank, appointed Mr Duisenberg to replace Denmark's Erik Hoffmeyer.
Mr Hoffmeyer was appointed as an acting chairman last year to serve out the
term of the then Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, after his
resignation.
Mr Duisenberg, 57, and a social democrat, is a late convert to the idea of
government budgetary restraint which will be one of the main criteria for
allowing EC members to join in an eventual single currency.
He served as Dutch finance minister from 1973 to 1977 in a socialist-led
government which tried to spend its way out of the effects of the first oil
crisis. He left politics in 1978 after a brief stint in parliament to take a
seat on the board of Rabobank, a co-operative bank for agriculture. The
governors' committee has grown in power and influence since the first stage
of the EC planned progress towards Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) in
1990.
EC governments have given it some powers to co-ordinate policy. It can offer
opinions on the monetary and exchange rate policy of member states and
convey these to members and finance ministers.
It is envisaged that the committee should later take on the role of an EC
central bank in the second stage of full Emu, due to occur in 1997 at the
earliest and 1999 at the latest.
But after he was appointed a central bank director and then its president in
1981, he became one of the leading critics of what he saw as government
overspending and expanding deficits.
As head of the Dutch central bank he has successfully managed a
low-inflation monetary policy very closely tied to that of Germany, the
Netherlands' biggest trading partner.
But in contrast to the Bundesbank, he has in the past argued that monetary
policy should not be exclusively the preserve of central banks.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Chemical industry 'faces over-capacity challenge'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST European ethylene manufacturers were warned yesterday they face a
sustained period of unprofitability and cannot rely on demand growth to
restore profits.
The industry would require improbable annual economic growth rates
approaching 6 per cent if it was to reach more acceptable profitability by
1995, said Mr Peter Kwant, vice-president of European petrochemicals at
Shell International Chemical Company.
Mr Kwant, speaking at the Financial Times Petrochemicals conference in
London, said the European industry was mature, suffering from over-capacity,
weak economic growth and high relative costs. Unless it closed its less
efficient units, it would face the prospect of prolonged financial distress.
The biggest challenge facing the industry remains over-capacity. Global
capacity increased from 48m tonnes a year in 1986 to 70m, and would reach
90m tonnes by the end of the decade, warned Mr Stephen Pettit, chief
executive of BP Chemicals' petrochemicals division. Worldwide demand growth
would average only 5 per cent before the year 2000. Unless action was taken,
European operating rates would not improve until 1994 and would not reach 95
per cent until the end of the decade.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer of Imperial Chemical Industries,
said only a small start had been made in the restructuring and
rationalisation required in all parts of the chemical industry. 'We are
putting our heads in the sand if we do not recognise that in all branches of
the industry there are too many players.'
Although the number of European manufacturers had been reduced since 1980,
there were too many in ethylene, low-density polyethylene, PVC and
polypropylene. Many areas of speciality chemicals were also suffering from
excess capacity, said Mr Hampel.
However, Mr Pettit said there were not enough really uncompetitive crackers
which were obvious candidates to influence significantly the capacity/demand
imbalance. He called for the creation of a pan-European pipeline which would
increase the merchant ethylene market and reduce the rapid swings in prices.

THE BUNDESBANK was partly to blame for September's turbulence in the
currency markets, as a result of its controversial decision to increase
interest rates in July, a main-board director of Deutsche Bank, Germany's
largest bank, said yesterday.
Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, the board member responsible for economics, said that
the market judged that other countries would be unable to follow suit.
Investors had behaved accordingly, moving their assets out of softer
currencies into the D-Mark.
His remarks coincided with a defence of the Bundesbank by Mr Horst Kohler,
the state secretary for finance in Bonn, who warned that countries with
weaker currencies could not expect to have their exchange rates supported
with automatic cuts in interest rates from the German central bank.
Yet Mr Kohler, who is Germany's chief international financial negotiator,
also warned that the Bundesbank could not conduct its monetary policy
totally divorced from political reality and all democratic control. He said
he would like to see lower interest rates in Germany, but stopped short of
calling on the Bundesbank to cut them immediately.
Mr Cartellieri's remarks amount to the first open criticism of Bundesbank
monetary policy, from the top levels of the German banking industry.
In an implicit rebuke to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president,
who in a recent speech blamed speculators for the currency turmoil, the
Deutsche Bank economist said that those who were indulging in so-called
speculation were careful financial managers, in big companies and in
financial institutions, who had large cash balances in the weaker
currencies.
'It was obvious for months that above all Britain, but also France, needed
lower interest rates in order to enliven their economies,' Mr Cartellieri
said. That was made impossible by the Bundesbank's decision to increase its
discount rate by 0.75 points to 8.75 per cent on July 16, in a bid to curb
domestic inflation.
The resulting currency turbulence had done direct damage to German industry
by increasing the value of the D-Mark against other currencies.
He said that under present circumstances there was a real danger of a
'downwards spiral' of devaluation, with threatening consequences for jobs,
investment and economies across Europe. It was essential to carry on towards
the goal of a single currency for Europe, Mr Cartellieri said.
Mr Cartellieri's remarks, ahead of tomorrow's Bundesbank Council meeting to
determine a target for next year's M3 broad measure of money supply, amounts
to a sharp attack on the central bank's monetary policy over recent months.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE establishment of a permanent headquarters for Europol, the planned
European criminal intelligence agency, is facing potentially a long-term
delay because of differences between EC member states, police officials said
yesterday, write Jimmy Burns in London and Andrew Hill in Brussels.
Detective Superintendent Ian Morrison, the UK delegate at Europol's pilot
offices in Strasbourg, said that in the unlikely event that agreement is
reached at the Edinburgh summit, it could take at least six months before
Europol can become functional.
'There appears to be general agreement on the terms of reference of Europol
but the issue of location is undecided and without it Europol cannot start,'
Mr Morrison said.
Sharp differences over the location of Europol, which was due to start a
drugs unit on January 1 surfaced last week during a meeting of EC interior
ministers in London.
Political passions are such that Dutch officials publicly alleged last week
that France was attempting to discredit The Hague's candidacy for the
institution by accusing the Dutch government of failing to curb the sale of
soft drugs. It is thought likely that the dispute may only be resolved when
there is a wider trade-off over other future permanent locations of key EC
institutions.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German motor industry yesterday announced sweeping production cuts early
next year in a bid to reduce stocks and avoid further job losses.
Audi, the up-market Volkswagen subsidiary, said about 25,000 of its 37,500
workers would be put on short-time for three weeks during the first quarter
of 1993.
Mercedes-Benz announced 14 days' short-time working at its four German car
assembly plants in January and February, and up to 40 days at three
components factories. Most of the group's 95,000 car workers are likely to
be affected.
Meanwhile, Volkswagen said that up to 14,000 of the 18,000 workers employed
at its Hanover works would be sent home for a week during January.
All three companies have already announced plans for large-scale job cuts
over the next two or three years as well as extended Christmas holidays in
most of their factories. The latest announcements - short-time working in
Germany effectively means stopping production - reflect the recent rapid
deterioration in domestic markets and continuing recession abroad.
However, there are suggestions that workforce reductions, both planned and
executed, may not be enough to counter the effects of recession. Mercedes,
for example, has already shed 12,500 workers in the past 12 months.
Short-time working is commonly introduced as an interim measure to balance
supply and demand, but in many manufacturing industries hit by the current
downturn, it has become a prelude to job losses.
Audi, which recently unveiled plans to reduce its workforce by 10 per cent,
said the latest move was 'a reaction to the continuing order weakness in the
domestic and important European export markets'.
There were also unconfirmed reports yesterday that Ford-Werke, the German
subsidiary of the US vehicle maker, was headed for its first loss in six
years and planned to shed up to 3,000 workers.
According to some estimates new car registrations in Germany will fall by
500,000 next year.
Industry analysts have forecast a 5 per cent fall in western European demand
next year, although Ford and Mercedes both hope to regain some ground with
important launches of new or revamped models.
BMW, which till benefiting from the impact of its new 3-Series models, said
that short-time was out of the question.
The group recently announced proposals for the loss of 3,000 jobs next year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE the chorus of furies in an ancient play, dissatisfied deputies in the
ruling New Democracy party are hounding Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek
prime minister. They want him to relax the government's commitment to
economic reform.
Mr Mitsotakis retaliated last week by sacking the entire cabinet, only to
recall most key ministers after failing to persuade his severest critic, Mr
Miltiades Evert, to rejoin the government. He also appointed 19 new junior
ministers in an attempt to defuse accusations that decision-making is
confined to a coterie around the prime minister's family.
However, Mr Stefanos Manos was left in charge at the economy and finance
ministries, underlining that reform is still on track. If applied with
sufficient rigour, Mr Manos's adjustment programme should reduce Greece's
swollen public sector deficit to manageable levels next year and bring
inflation below 10 per cent for the first time in two decades.
Nonetheless, Mr Mitsotakis can expect more trouble from his party in the
months ahead. Next spring marks the start of an election year, when the
government will come under increased pressure to abandon the stabilisation
programme.
New Democracy deputies are unashamedly demanding an end to wage restraints,
more patronage appointments and generous spending on public works in
marginal constituencies. They showed what they thought of Mr Manos's
policies by staying away from parliament when he presented an austerity
budget for 1993. Despite Mr Mitsotakis's efforts to reimpose his authority
on the party, the budget vote later this month will be a difficult test for
the government.
The main challenge comes from Mr Evert, who was fired from the cabinet a
year ago for trying to interfere in foreign policy when his brief was to
reform the civil service.
Since then Mr Evert has been positioning himself to succeed the 74-year-old
Mr Mitsotakis as party leader, choosing the economy as the issue on which he
can most easily embarrass the government. As recession continues, Mr Evert's
arguments in favour of promoting growth through increased spending and cuts
in interest rates find favour with a large section of the Greek business
community.
Mr Evert also seems to advocate a compromise on privatisation, which is
supposed to be the central plank in New Democracy's economic platform but
arouses fierce party opposition.
But if Mr Manos's aims of containing the deficit are to be achieved, it will
largely be due to the Dr330bn (Pounds 1bn) in privatisation revenues
projected for next year. Moreover, he is counting on about Dr300bn in extra
income from direct taxation. Part of this will come from another potentially
unpopular move: a crackdown on tax evasion.

would average only 5 per cent before the year 2000. Unless action was taken,
European operating rates would not improve until 1994 and would not reach 95
per cent until the end of the decade.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer of Imperial Chemical Industries,
said only a small start had been made in the restructuring and
rationalisation required in all parts of the chemical industry. 'We are
putting our heads in the sand if we do not recognise that in all branches of
the industry there are too many players.'
Although the number of European manufacturers had been reduced since 1980,
there were too many in ethylene, low-density polyethylene, PVC and
polypropylene. Many areas of speciality chemicals were also suffering from
excess capacity, said Mr Hampel.
However, Mr Pettit at BP said there were not enough really uncompetitive
crackers which were obvious candidates to influence significantly the
capacity/demand imbalance. He called for the creation of a pan-European
pipeline which would increase the merchant ethylene market and reduce the
rapid swings in prices.
Mr Pettit said the industry also needed more joint-ventures, alliances and
portfolio swaps, and sharing of assets and sites.
Mr Hampel said the penchant for diversification during the 1980s meant
companies were now involved in too many peripheral businesses. Chemical
groups must seek cost effective rationalisation.

EC TAX authorities should not punish companies which accidentally break
complex new VAT rules in the first few months of 1993, a senior European
Commission official said yesterday.
Mr Peter Wilmott, who heads the Commission's indirect tax and customs
directorate, has written to the 12 national administrations urging a lenient
attitude towards companies that are slow to meet the requirements. In turn,
Brussels is likely to be lenient with laggard member states.
'We expect member states to be understanding of traders' difficulties,' he
said yesterday. 'That doesn't mean they should simply write off big tax
debts, but they shouldn't be wheeling out the big guns to sanction people
who didn't really understand what they were doing.'
A transitional VAT regime comes into force on January 1, and is the key to
lifting border controls on goods. But there are fears that the opening of
the single market may be marred by a lack of understanding about the system.
EC transport ministers adjourned talks yesterday until December 21 on the
right of hauliers to ply for trade in other EC countries, Reuter reports
from Brussels.

THE younger generation of foreigners living in Germany must be given easier
access to citizenship as a means of fully integrating them into German
society, Mrs Cornelia Schmalz-Jakobsen, head of the federal department for
the problems of foreigners, said yesterday.
She said continuing opposition, particularly from the Bavarian-based
Christian Social Union, the sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling
Christian Democratic Union, was holding up any changes to the current
nationality law, as well as the introduction of an immigration law. German
nationality is based on direct German ancestry.
The need to give the younger generation a sense of identity in Germany
coincides with nationwide demonstrations against racism which have been
organised by the country's universities.
They started on Monday, and will last until Friday, the day after Mr Kohl
delivers a special speech to the Bundestag on right-wing extremism and
violence.
His speech, which will be followed by a two-hour debate, is in response to
domestic and international pressure for the government to play a much more
prominent role in combating xenophobia and arson attacks on foreigners.
Yesterday, legal proceedings were started against Mr Thomas Dienel, head of
the far-right National Democratic Party, who allegedly said he regretted
that Germany's younger generation had not killed any Jews.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Amstrad group will appoint two non-executive directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group whose shareholders meet tomorrow to
decide the fate of Mr Alan Sugar's 30p-a-share buy-out bid, has bowed to
pressure from investors and is to appoint two non-executive directors to its
board.
Yesterday, as the deadline for receipt of proxies for the group's
extraordinary meeting passed, Amstrad acknowledged that Mr Sugar's Pounds
113m bid to take the company private again looks 'increasingly likely' to be
defeated.
In a tacit admission that the Amstrad chairman's proposals have met strong
opposition, the company said it had asked Pro Ned, the independent
organisation which promotes the role of non-executives, to draw up a
shortlist of potential candidates for the Amstrad board.
An advertisement to be published in the Financial Times tomorrow says the
first applicant 'should have sufficiently senior experience to be able to
appraise all financial aspects of the company'. It says the second
applicant, 'should be an industrialist with a consumer product manufacturing
background, or be highly experienced in the distribution of consumer
products to trade customers'.
An unusual accompanying statement says that although the advertisement has
been placed by Amstrad, 'the board wish to demonstrate their independence in
the appointment of two non- executive directors', and have therefore
entrusted the selection of a short list to Pro Ned.
Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman and founder who has a personal 35 per cent
stake in the group, said at the group's annual meeting last month that if
his bid failed he would appoint new non-executive directors to the board.
Since Mr Sugar made his buy-back offer, institutional investors in
particular have been extremely critical that there was no 'independent
voice' on the Amstrad board looking after minority shareholder interests.
Mr Tim Holland-Bosworth, a director at Kleinwort Benson, Amstrad's financial
adviser, acknowledged yesterday that 'a number of institutional shareholders
had made the point' that they wanted to see non-executive directors back on
the six-member Amstrad board. Amstrad had two non-executive directors after
it became a public company in 1980, but both have since left.
Institutional investors, led by Prudential and Postel, have cited the lack
of non-executive directors and the absence of financial forecasts and other
information on Amstrad's prospects, as reasons for opposing the deal.
Amstrad's share price, which dropped 4p to 24p on Monday after it became
clear that the plan faced strong opposition, closed 1p up at 25p yesterday.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Maastricht will not wait for UK, says Mitterrand: Ten
nations determined to press ahead with 'construction of Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TEN OUT OF 12 European Community member states are determined to press ahead
with implementing the Maastricht treaty on European union whether or not
Denmark and Britain join them in ratifying the accord next year, President
Francois Mitterrand of France said yesterday.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mitterrand insisted that the
treaty would neither be renegotiated nor amended to secure Denmark's
acceptance in a second referendum next year. He also claimed to have the
support of a majority of other member states for this view.
'Rejection by the countries in question (Britain and Denmark) will not stop
the construction of Europe . . . The old Europe of the Six plus Portugal and
Spain find themselves completely on the same wavelength,' he said. Ireland
and Greece have also ratified the treaty. 'We can't make an agreement minus
a single currency, minus the central bank, minus a common foreign policy.'
Mr Mitterrand said it would be legally possible to adapt the treaty - 'not
in substance but in form' - to exclude Denmark in the event of another
rejection by Danish voters. As for Britain, he added: 'I do not despair at
all of seeing Great Britain adhere to the treaty that the head of its
government signed.'
While he refrained from comment on Britain's latest proposals for dealing
with Danish objections to Maastricht, the French president's remarks signal
a hardening of tone on this central question ahead of Friday's Edinburgh
summit. They seem intended in part to increase the pressure on Mr John
Major, the prime minister and current EC president, to speed up ratification
of the treaty in parliament, rather than waiting for the outcome of another
Danish vote in May or later.
Such pressure, however, may complicate Mr Major's efforts to muster
consensus at Edinburgh while struggling with his own backbench rebels, whom
he has assured that he will delay completing ratification until after a
second Danish vote. Mr Mitterrand, who is due to meet Mr Major tomorrow
night before the summit begins, said it would not be 'catastrophic' if
British ratification took another four months, but that Britain should not
make its decision hinge on that of another country.
Also in the interview, Mr Mitterrand:
Expressed determination to resist pressure from his European partners over
the recent EC-US deal on farm trade. He said he did not expect the issue to
come up at Edinburgh, as negotiations on an overall settlement in the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were still
continuing. He said France wanted a reopening of negotiations on agriculture
with Washington. If there were no concessions on farm trade, however, he
said France would have to act with 'great firmness' - while refusing to be
drawn on whether it would use its veto. Reaffirmed his determination not to
devalue the French franc, which has been under sporadic but heavy pressure
in recent weeks. 'Devaluation has never been considered a good policy,' he
said. 'France's economic indicators are the best at the moment within the
EC.'
Said he did not see the need to move the franc to a narrower band within the
European monetary system, but that the idea was 'for discussion'.
Renewed his backing for a 'European growth initiative' involving the
acceleration of large EC infrastructure projects, and called again for a cut
in German interest rates.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Ford to raise prices by up to 10% in January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD yesterday announced plans to increase car prices by between 4 1/2 per
cent and 10 per cent, surprising the industry and provoking consumer group
and political protests.
Ford, which has made heavy losses and whose UK market leadership is under
severe pressure, blamed the rises on sterling's devaluation and other cost
increases.
The rises - effective from January 3 - include 7.5 per cent increases for
Sierras and Granadas and are larger than any imposed or indicated by rivals.
The Consumers' Association and opposition politicians said Ford appeared to
be seeking to lead the industry, not consumers, in reaping the benefits of
the recent abolition of 5 per cent special car tax, averaging Pounds 400 a
car.
Ford rejected the allegation, saying: 'Our costs have risen far more than
the increases we have put forward as a result of the devaluation.'
Nevertheless, its move was seen as a potentially risky gamble by some
industry analysts. As market leader for many years, Ford has led several
rounds of increases and been able to rely on rivals following suit.
But Vauxhall is challenging its leadership. With other rivals professing
little inclination towards further rises, Ford may find itself isolated
while bearing the brunt of consumer criticism over the already stormy issue
of perceived high UK car prices.
Rover said it had no plans to raise prices, as did Vauxhall, which announced
a 3.25 per cent rise just before car tax was abolished. German
manufacturers, worst hit by devaluation, have already put up prices and may
raise them again in the new year.
Mr Stephen Locke, the Consumers' Association's director of policy, said
Ford's move 'confirms all our worst fears about the manufacturers' desire to
see the UK as a high-price, high-profit market'.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, accused the
industry of failing to pass on car tax savings. 'The chancellor is being
walked over by the manufacturers,' he said.
Mr Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business
School, said the rises may indicate a strategy change by Ford to a lower
market share but with profitable sales.

FT  09 DEC 92 / Hopes of EC summit pact raised: Major and Mitterrand to hold
meeting on eve of Edinburgh talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers made progress yesterday on resolving
Denmark's difficulties with the Maastricht treaty on European union, raising
hopes of a solution at this week's summit of EC leaders in Edinburgh.
However, officials of the British presidency warned last night that new
changes sought by the Danes, particularly on defence issues, could prove a
fresh obstacle to an agreement.
A solution allowing Denmark to put the treaty to a second referendum is seen
as the lever needed to reach agreement on the main differences affecting the
Community, notably the budget, enlargement and decentralised
decision-making.
Foreign ministers from several member states, during a meeting in Brussels,
raised reservations about a UK draft allowing Denmark legally binding
opt-outs from the Maastricht treaty. Italy, Spain, and Germany - acting on
legal advice - suggested the UK paper amounted to a new treaty.
But Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said the Community 'should never
leave its fate to lawyers'.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, agreed: 'I am sure legal
doubts can be dealt with after today's discussion. After that it is a matter
of political will.'
The 'conclave' of EC foreign ministers in Brussels was the last high-level
gathering of the Twelve ahead of Edinburgh, which many member states believe
is doomed to failure.
Last night, Downing Street announced that Mr John Major would hold an
unscheduled eve-of-summit dinner with President Francois Mitterrand in
Edinburgh tomorrow night.
The surprise meeting, agreed in a telephone call between the two leaders
yesterday, comes after British officials had stressed that no such encounter
was necessary due to regular contacts between Paris and London.
Nonetheless, the absence of a visit to the Elysee Palace on Mr Major's tour
of capitals ahead of the summit had drawn speculation that Anglo-French
relations have deteriorated significantly during Britain's six-month EC
presidency.
Downing Street would say only that Britain and France shared many joint
positions on issues to be addressed at Edinburgh. It said consultations were
needed on the order of the agenda, including the so-called Danish question.
The Brussels talks yesterday were aimed at meeting Denmark's demands for
opt-outs on a common currency, a European army, justice matters and EC
citizenship. Mr Jean-Claude Piris, head of the European Council's legal
service, who helped draft the UK paper, declared that the UK formula would
not require members to re-ratify Maastricht.
A new legally refined UK draft will be circulated before Edinburgh, with a
final decision unlikely before the end of the summit on Saturday night. 'It
is balanced on a razor's edge', said Mr Hurd.
Foreign ministers and Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, also
highlighted their still unresolved differences on 'subsidiarity' -
decentralising decision making - and making Community business more open and
democratic.

WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank Girozentrale, the state bank of North-Rhine
Westphalia, is expanding its influence in the German public sector banking
arena with the acquisition of a stake in Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, the
state bank of its closest southern neighbour.
WestLB and Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank (SudwestLB), its Baden-Wurtemmberg
associate, will pay DM750m (Dollars 471.6m) for a 50 per cent stake in the
Mainz-based bank. WestLB will own 37.5 per cent and SudwestLB 12.5 per cent.
The move is part of a complex restructuring of German public sector banking,
with WestLB - one of Germany's biggest banks - playing a leading role. It is
in negotiations to take control of a majority stake in the Kiel-based
Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein, after winning the state government's approval
for the move against a rival bid from the Hanover-based Norddeutsche
Landesbank, the Landesbank for Lower Saxony.
WestLB, which is expected to report operating profits of about DM1bn this
year, takes an active approach to its investment activities. It is believed
to have spent DM1.6bn on industrial acquisitions since 1991.

FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pacific Dunlop sells Eastman
stake to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Dunlop, the Australian industrial group, has settled the sale of
Eastman, the US stationery and furniture group, for USDollars 142m.
Eastman, formerly a joint venture between Pacific Dunlop and David Jones,
the Australian retailer, has been purchased by McCown DeLeeuw, a US venture
banking company.
Pacific Dunlop acquired its interest in Eastman through the takeover of
Petersville Sleigh, the Australian food group, in August last year. Initial
plans to float Eastman for USDollars 215m, were abandoned.
The sale is the latest in a string of disposals of Petersville assets by
Pacific Dunlop. Directors said the Eastman sale price had allowed Pacific
Dunlop to recoup the book value of its investment.
Mayne Nickless, the transport group, has confirmed plans to acquire France
Distribution System, the Paris-based warehousing and distribution company.
Mayne Nickless said FDS was France's leading company in the warehousing and
distribution of dry grocery products, with annual sales of about ADollars
167m (USDollars 115.7m). The acquisition, from Scac-Delmas-Vieljeux, a
private French company, is subject to French Treasury approval.
The Australian government has approved the bitterly-contested bid by
Campbell Soup, the US food group, for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit
company, subject to a number of conditions.
Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, surprised the stockmarkets by announcing
the approval yesterday. Analysts had expected the bid, at ADollars 8.80 a
share and valuing Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn, to be frozen for 90 days.
Mr Dawkins' conditions on the bid include that Arnotts must remain listed in

<TEXT>
HAFNIA, the troubled Danish insurance company, is negotiating the sale of
Prolific, its UK life insurance subsidiary, to Scottish Provident, the
mutually-owned life insurance company.
The sale would be the most significant disposal by Hafnia since the company
suspended payments to creditors in August. Hafnia bought Prolific for Pounds
90.6m (Dollars 137.7m) in 1989.
Analysts estimate the market value of Prolific to be between Pounds 20m and
Pounds 65m. Paribas is handling the sale for Hafnia.
Hafnia said it was also making progress in the sale of its Danish insurance
and banking interests. At least three companies were said to be interested.
Morgan Stanley, the US securities house, is handling the transaction.
The company is seeking bidders for Economic, its UK general insurance
company; Holnia, a Swedish insurance subsidiary; and C and V, a Swiss bank,
and other assets.

FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Warning as German banks show
growth
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MORE large German banks reported robust growth in profits for the first
10 months of the year, providing further evidence of the resilience of the
banking sector amid deepening economic gloom in Germany.
But both the Dresdner Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank warned of the need for
sharply increased risk provisioning.
Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-largest bank, yesterday reported group total
operating profits up 16.6 per cent to DM2.37bn (Dollars 1.49bn). Partial
operating profits - which exclude any contribution from own-account trading
 -rose at a higher rate, by nearly 19 per cent to DM2.09bn.
The Bayerische Vereinsbank said its group partial operating profits rose by
20.5 per cent to DM1.2bn. At the parent bank, partial operating profits
climbed by more than 25.3 per cent to DM775m. The bank said full operating
profits for both parent and group climbed at a higher rate, but gave no
precise figure.
Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of the Dresdner Bank, warned that, when
the full-year accounts were drawn up, the bank would have to make big
provisions to cover bad and doubtful debts. This reflected the state of the
economy and 'unsatisfactory' credit environment. This theme was echoed by Mr
Albrecht Schmidt, chief executive of the Vereinsbank.
The Federal Cartel Office in Berlin has decided that proposed business
co-operation between the Dresdner Bank and Allianz can go ahead.
Yesterday's announcement removes the last regulatory obstacle to the two
institutions' plans. In September cartel authorities found Allianz's 22.3
per cent stake in Dresdner was not anti-competitive.
The agreement envisages a cross-marketing of each others' services across a
number of German federal states.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACAL, the electronics and industrial controls distributor, reported lower
interim profits although turnover increased as a result of recent
acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 fell by 12 per cent from
Pounds 1.52m to Pounds 1.34m on turnover which grew from Pounds 29.1m to
Pounds 30.9m, including Pounds 3m attributed to recent acquisitions.
Turnover in the underlying business slipped by 5 per cent, but was
maintained at the same level as the second half of last year.
Earnings per share dropped to 6.3p (7.1p), in part reflecting the 680,000
new shares issued at 214p each in July to fund the acquisition of
Belgium-based Betea Components for BFr97m (Pounds 1.95m). The interim
dividend is increased by 7.7 per to 2.1p (1.95p) per share.
Mr John Curry, chairman, said gross margins had been maintained during 1991
and 1992, despite tough market conditions. Operating profit slipped to
Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.82m).
He added that the electronics divisions held up well in both the UK and
continental Europe, although there were now signs of softness in northern
Europe.
Sales in the industrial and refrigeration divisions were down in most of
Europe. Nevertheless Mr Curry said the group was achieving growth outside
Europe in the refrigeration business set up last year.
He added that the group was seeing a small growth in orders during the
current financial year. 'We are no longer eating into the order backlog and
gross margins are reasonably stable in spite of currency fluctuations and
very competitive market conditions,' he said.
With more than 70 per cent of the group's business overseas, the group
should also be a net beneficiary of the recent effective devaluation of
sterling on translation of overseas earnings.

FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Henderson in Pounds 42.5m expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON Administration has agreed to pay Pounds 42.5m cash for Touche
Remnant, its fellow fund management group. The two companies announced they
were in takeover talks in October.
As part of the deal, Societe Generale, Touche Remnant's current owner, has
agreed to take on the 22 year lease of TR's headquarters in London's Puddle
Dock.
The TR staff will transfer to Henderson's office in Finsbury Avenue;
Henderson estimates this will save Pounds 2.5m a year.
A condition of the deal is that Touche Remnant has net assets of Pounds
15.4m, and net cash (or its equivalent) of Pounds 18m, on acquisition.
The combined company will have about Pounds 9.9bn of funds under management,
of which a quarter will be in investment trusts - making the group the
biggest investment trust manager in the UK.
Mr Paul Manduca, Touche Remnant's chairman, will join the Henderson board
and will be deputy group managing director.
The acquisition circular shows that Touche Remnant incurred an operating
loss of Pounds 3.07m in 1991. Interest receivable of Pounds 2.4m reduced the
pre-tax loss to Pounds 668,000.
Henderson said that the takeover should bring considerable cost savings. Its
operating expenses are equivalent to 0.4 per cent of funds under management;
Touche Remnant's expenses represent 0.8 per cent.
The deal will have to be approved at an extraordinary meeting of Henderson
shareholders on December 21. Henderson's shares rose 47p to 685p yesterday.

FT  08 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Henderson/Touche
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On an optimistic reading of the cycle, Henderson Administration could hardly
have chosen a better time to exchange its cash for earnings geared to the
equity market. The All-Share Index has risen by 7 per cent since its
acquisition of Touche Remnant was first mooted in mid-October. The returns
on cash, meanwhile, are not what they were. Strange, then, that Henderson's
shares have notably underperformed following the initial euphoria over the
deal. Yesterday's 7 per cent rise simply retraces some of that lost ground.
True, the sudden departure of Mr David Backhouse last month was an unwelcome
distraction, but Henderson has yet to convince that it is spending wisely.
The Pounds 42.5m purchase price looks sensible enough, although Societe
Generale doubtless thought as much when it paid Pounds 50m in 1989. Stable
earnings from investment trusts are a neat fit with Henderson's strength in
pension fund management, yet Touche will barely break even this year on
Pounds 2bn funds under management. Henderson shareholders might feel they
were more secure with the cash pile. The success of the deal turns on
Henderson's ability to take out costs without prompting the best of its
newly acquired talent to walk out the door.
Handing over Touche's lease to its former parent is an encouraging start.
Equally there should be savings from combining back office and
administration. But it remains to be seen whether the two sides can avoid
falling out during the subsequent pruning of manpower. With the shares on an
8 per cent yield - even after yesterday's rally - the market is clearly not
taking much on trust.

FT  08 DEC 92 / People: Two 'very strong contenders' for Marley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Trapnell (left), a main board director of building materials group
Marley, has leap-frogged group managing director John Castle to become group
chief executive with effect from the beginning of next year. Since 1989, Sir
George Russell had combined the roles of executive chairman and chief
executive, but the company says it had always been intended he would
relinquish the post of chief executive when a suitable successor was found.
Trapnell's appointment follows a period of considerable boardroom upheaval.
In mid-1990, John Castle was elevated to his present position, prompting the
departures of Keith Howell, then finance director, and another board member
Mike Moxon. Now Castle, 47, who had been running the day-to-day operations
and to whom Trapnell, also 47, reported, is leaving Marley.
Chris Beenham, the current finance director, describes Trapnell and Castle
as 'both very strong contenders. One had to be chosen'. Trapnell has
distinguished himself in rationalising the UK building product companies
against the background of an extremely difficult market, according to
Beenham. He had also been responsible for the French building companies.
With the company since 1971, Trapnell joined as a factory manager on the
roof-tile side. Apart from three years in California between 1979-1982
setting up a roof-tile operation there, he has been based in the UK, and was
brought on to the main board in 1989. Castle, who joined Marley in 1986,
also joined the board in that year.
At the same time, prompted by the Cadbury recommendations on corporate
governance, Gary Allen, chief executive of IMI, has been made deputy
chairman, a new position 'created to reflect the fact that he is the most
senior of the non-executive directors,' says Beenham. He adds that Sir
George, who has just been appointed a non-executive director of Taylor
Woodrow, will remain executive chairman 'for the foreseeable future'.
*****
Paul Vickers, assistant md and company secretary of TV-am, has been
appointed company secretary and group legal director of MIRROR GROUP
NEWSPAPERS; he will remain company secretary of TV-am until that company's
next agm, expected to be in March 1993.

The Confederation of British Industry has warned that the new European
Community directive on data protection will cost British businesses millions
of pounds in unnecessary compliance costs. The employers' organisation says
the level of data protection in the UK under the 1984 Data Protection Act is
adequate. The CBI says it would make more sense to impose the UK's tough
data protection rules on EC countries which lack such legislation rather
than impose the directive's high level of protection, which may actually
impede cross-border data flow.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Bribe case against rail chiefs collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OLD BAILEY corruption trial of a former British Rail senior executive
and two directors of Plasser GB, the rail maintenance supplier, collapsed
yesterday for lack of evidence.
Mr David Currie, BR's former head of civil engineering, Mr Norbert Jurasek,
Plasser's managing director, Mr Michael Brooks, Plasser's company secretary,
and the Austrian-owned company itself were all acquitted of bribery charges
on the orders of the judge.
All were also acquitted of another charge of conspiring to bribe other BR
staff.
The prosecution had alleged that corporate hospitality and entertainment
provided by Plasser to Mr Currie and other BR employees amounted to a
corrupt attempt to win contracts.
The hospitality included air tickets to Europe and the US, cases of wine and
tickets to sporting events.
Mr Justice Buckley said the charges against Plasser and the three men
related to items worth a maximum of Pounds 11,000 spent over 10 years.
Depending on the method of calculation, that figure might be just Pounds
5,000 over the period, he said.
It was not a case of bribery in the sense of money being passed, he went on.
There had been no evidence of the alleged bribes having worked and the
Plasser defendants had never tried to 'call in' the bribes by reminding BR
staff of the benefits they had received, he said.
Prosecution allegations that the gifts had enabled Mr Currie to live the
life of a rich man were simply not borne out by the evidence, he went on.
Mr Justice Buckley strongly criticised BR for not having acted earlier. In
1983, BR held an internal inquiry after a complaint from a rival supplier
about the extent of Plasser's entertaining.
Although the level of hospitality breached its guidelines on accepting
gifts, the judge said, BR made no attempt to correct the situation or point
out to Plasser that the scale of its entertaining was embarrassing.
It was a tragedy that BR had allowed the situation to continue. Had the
matter been dealt with then, the case would never had come to court, he
said.
BR said later guidelines on accepting gifts had since been tightened up to
avoid a recurrence of the situation.
The costs of the trial - estimated at between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m  -
will be met from public funds.
The prosecution was initiated by British Transport Police, an independent
arm of British Rail, which first raided Plasser's offices in September 1988.
Since the legal proceedings began, it is understood that Plasser's business
with BR has declined substantially. Contracts worth several millions of
pounds have been won by competitors.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Fimbra critics ready to attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIMBRA, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers, is
expected to be criticised at its annual meeting today over the presentation
of its financial position in its accounts, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, the banking and
asset management group, said he would question the board on the accounts
recently lodged with Companies House. 'These are accounts that Fimbra would
not allow from its own members,' he said.
He was disturbed by the fact that the accounts were for the year to March 31
and yet were being discussed only in December, after they were 'horrendously
out of date'.
He echoed the concern of several members that the accounts omitted adequate
details of the commitments by the body to the Investors' Compensation
Scheme, the industry-wide arrangement that covers financial advisers, life
company salesmen and Stock Exchange firms.
The scheme's accounts are published separately, but the Fimbra accounts show
the scheme as a creditor for Pounds 486,767. They do not provide a balancing
debtor figure to show the amount of levies paid out to the scheme.
Other critics of Fimbra's accounts have expressed concern over the decision
to change its accounting policy last year to treat deferred subscriptions
and registration fees in its balance sheet with capital and reserves, rather
than treating them as creditors. Without that balancing item - which
amounted to Pounds 2.9m this year - Fimbra would have been technically
insolvent.

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S opposition gained a stunning victory in Sunday's state and local
elections, winning a majority of seats for governors and mayors, according
to preliminary results.
Voting took place peacefully, despite nervousness following a failed
military uprising against the government on November 27. As usual, troops
were posted at each of Venezuela's 8,000 voting centres to ensure order.
The governing Democratic Action (AD) party, which calls itself 'the party of
the people', was forced into a minority position in state and local polls
for the first time in the country's 34-year democratic history. Despite
efforts by AD leaders to distance themselves from the unpopular free-market
policies of President Carlos Andres Perez, most Venezuelans rejected the
party.
The main opposition force, the Christian Democrat Copei party, won heavily,
and two left-wing organisations, the Socialist party MAS and Causa R, a
militant group, also scored important victories.
The vote showed the strongest preference for left-wing candidates on record
and suggested a weakening of the traditional two-party system dominated by
AD and Copei.
Preliminary returns in state governorship contests give opposition parties a
firm 14 out of a total of 22 states, compared with four for AD.
In Caracas, voters rejected the two main parties to choose a leftist as the
capital's mayor, the private network Televen projected.
In 1989, when the last state and local elections were held, the governing
party won 11 of 20 states (two federal territories have become states since
then), Copei seven and MAS and Causa R one each.
There were no official figures on voter abstention, which reached 73 per
cent in Caracas three years ago. Unofficially, voting authorities said they
believed abstention was lower this time. Venezuelans are scheduled to elect
a new president, national congress and state legislatures next December.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Bucking The Trend: Precision approach to following the
market - An engineering group's recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAINLESS Metalcraft seems to have experienced the economic cycle the wrong
way round. In the second half of the 1980s, when many were enjoying what
some regarded as an economic miracle, company profits were plummeting. Now,
in the depths of recession, profits are rising sharply.
As if to commemorate the reverse, the company is changing its name of
Ferraris. That may not strike a chord among the few who trade its shares on
the unlisted securities market, but the cognoscenti of the medical equipment
market will recognise it. So will those who use its asthma monitoring
equipment.
More than that, the new name is testimony that the company has manoeuvred
itself into the medical equipment sector, dropping, for example, general
engineering.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the chairman, said: 'You attack a market which is there,
rather than one which is disappearing.' Mr Baker cut his professional teeth
at Metal Box and subsequently worked in US, German and other British groups.
In the financial year to last August, Stainless Metalcraft, having made
losses in three of the four preceding years, had pre-tax profits of Pounds
353,000. There should be more this year, and the company has Singer &amp;
Friedlander, the merchant bank, helping it in a search for acquisitions.
Mr Baker said the losses were the result of 'a self-inflicted wound'.
Stainless Metalcraft was a sub-contractor to a sub-contractor on a storage
system for British Nuclear Fuels' waste. It was an unusually big contract
for the company: the work was delivered on time, but obtaining payment
turned into a welter of argument and arbitration. By the time the matter was
settled, the management had become hardened to adversity and the recession
had started. Stainless Metalcraft felt it early, 'when people started to
reduce capital spending, which was our area of business', as Mr Baker put
it.
The company's strategy was, in short, 'to get out of metal bashing' and to
develop the company along the lines of precision engineering 'with wider
shareholdings and wider interests', Mr Baker said.
The wider shareholdings meant diluting the interest of the Childs family,
which now stands at 25 per cent. The development meant driving the company
into higher-value-added, higher-technology products in the medical equipment
area. Ferraris Instruments had been bought in 1986. Production settled at
sites in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire - which generates about 70 per cent of
turnover - Kettering, in Northamptonshire; north London; and Ohio in the US.
'All through the recession, the company has continued to invest in
production equipment and the development of new products,' said Mr Baker.
There has been concentration on 'improving productivity by improving methods
of manufacturing in conjunction with our major customers.' The biggest
customer is Oxford Magnet Technology, part of Oxford Instruments, for which
Stainless Metalcraft has been making components for scanners and
co-operating on design and manufacturing techniques.
The result has been that the value of output for each Stainless Metalcraft
employee has risen over the past three years from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds
58,000 a year. There is another side: as is usually the case with
manufacturing investment, the more that is invested, the less the
employment. At Chatteris 150 people are employed; in 1988 there were 350.
Further, the company is on a financial tightrope. There are no complaints in
the boardroom about banks. 'We needed a lot of support to enable us to stand
our corner,' Mr Baker said. They still do.
Support came from Barclays, with generous overdraft and loan facilities, as
the percentage of debt relative to net assets went up from 70 in 1989, to 95
in 1990, and then to 154 last year, before coming down to 98 this year.
Ferraris, then, has to keep a steady balance to stay on the tightrope.
Still, there is some stability in the medical equipment market. Demand has
kept up, in spite of the recession, but, Mr Baker said, 'there is pressure
to keep down prices. If you can maintain your competitiveness, you can
maintain your market share.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENTURE capital industry is contracting more quickly than previously
expected across a broad range of activities, according to a survey by Levy
Gee, the accountants.
The list of organisations that have ceased to make new investments includes
foreign and UK banks, council-backed funds, technology investors and seed
capital organisations.
Many companies that have pulled out are small, but several large venture
funding providers have ceased to appear in the end-September update of Levy
Gee's UK venture capital database.
Venture capitalists say the industry's contraction has gone further than
they expected at the start of the recession. They expect further withdrawals
in the next few years.
Many funds that failed to perform well during the 1980s have found it
difficult to raise more money as the investment climate has become more
difficult during the recession.
The database lists 19 providers of venture and development capital that are
no longer active, while eight new funds have been set up. The total value of
funds under management by venture companies no longer listed is more than
Pounds 275m.
The foreign-bank-affiliated funds no longer listed as active investors are
Creditanstalt Development Capital and Saudi International Bank.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Move to save talks on Heathrow BR link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John MacGregor, transport secretary, is to meet British Rail and BAA, the
airports group, on Thursday in a last-ditch attempt to rescue the Pounds
300m Heathrow Express project.
Plans for the 16-mile rail link between Heathrow airport and central London
are on the brink of collapse amid a bitter dispute between British Rail and
BAA over the funding of the scheme.
If Mr MacGregor cannot persuade the two sides to reach an agreement in the
next few weeks, the project is likely to get caught up in the government's
plans for the privatisation of British Rail and may be postponed
indefinitely.
The Heathrow Express, intended to speed passengers between central London
and Heathrow in 16 minutes, is being developed jointly by BAA and British
Rail.
The plan is for BR to carry trains on its existing tracks for three quarters
of the journey. A private-sector consortium headed by BAA would build and
operate a spur taking the trains from BR's tracks to the airport.
BAA yesterday maintained that British Rail was undermining the commercial
viability of the project by demanding too high a price for the use of its
tracks.
'The bottom line is that if the operating costs are too high, then it simply
won't be possible to get third parties involved in putting their money into
the railway,' BAA said.
British Rail said the sum it was asking - about Pounds 6m a year -
represented only 11 per cent to 12 per cent of forecast revenues, whereas
other rail users typically faced track costs equivalent to 50 per cent of
revenues.
If BAA was serious about proceeding with the project, British Rail said, it
would have to make a contribution to the operating costs from its own
resources.
The outlay would easily be recouped by increased profits at Heathrow,
British Rail suggested.

FT  08 DEC 92 / US leads the art market recovery: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US seems to be leading the recovery in the art market. Sotheby's held
its best auction of American pictures for 2 1/2 years in New York at the
weekend, producing a total of Dollars 11.1m (Pounds 7m) with 21 per cent
unsold. Private collectors rather than dealers were the main buyers.
'The Unruly Calf', painted in 1875 by Winslow Homer, was nicely within
forecast at Dollars 1.21m (Pounds 765,000), and among the new artist record
prices were the Dollars 1.15m paid for 'Abstraction' painted in 1913 by
Marsden Hartley, and the Dollars 825,000 for 'Welcome to Our City' by
Charles Demuth.
Christie's sale in the same area was less successful, totalling Dollars 11m,
but with 31 per cent unsold. 'Ritz Tower, Night', a Georgia O'Keeffe
skyscraper scene, made Dollars 1.21m.
Sotheby's was selling two important private collections in Monaco at the
weekend, furniture from the Cap d'Antibes villa of the late Helene Beaumont
and the French silver of Pierre Jourdan-Barry. The furniture did well, with
only 3 per cent unsold, totalling FFr32.3m (Pounds 3.8m) with FFr8.4m being
paid for a bureau plat writing table made by Weisweiler in 1778 and
decorated with gouaches under glass. The silver made FFr15.4m, but was 27
per cent unsold.

FT  08 DEC 92 / DTI will delay research grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW RESEARCH grants or contracts from the Department of Trade and Industry
may be unavailable until April 1994 because the Pounds 110m-a-year DTI
innovation budget is overspent, the department has told researchers
unofficially.
Mr John Bennett, secretary general of the Association of Independent
Research and Technology Organisations, said some of his 36 member companies
had 'expressed very serious concern' about the moratorium.
Several organisations expected to receive new DTI funds next year to replace
expiring contracts. If funds do not arrive, they will have to shed
scientists and engineers.
About 10 research and technology organisations will suffer badly, said Mr
Ian Cooper, chairman of the association's policy committee and chief
executive of BHR Group, an engineering research body. The loss to his own
company would be about Pounds 1m next year. There would be the direct loss
of Pounds 700,000 in DTI funds, and that might lead to industry withdrawing
a further Pounds 300,000. 'That's a big chunk of our Pounds 7m turnover and
it will inevitably mean getting rid of some research teams,' he said.
Mr Douglas Munro, managing director of the British Textile Technology Group,
said: 'This is very bad news for R&amp;D work across the board. And it means
that some specific bright ideas from which industry would benefit are never
going to happen.'
One casualty of the DTI freeze on new R&amp;D spending is a Pounds 1.5m
environmental project involving five research organisations to develop
systems for removing pollutants from industrial effluents with immobilised
enzymes.
Mr Brian McCarthy, BTTG biotechnology manager, said: 'It is a field in which
the UK could quickly dominate world markets and the initial reaction from
DTI was very favourable; they said it was just the sort of work that should
be supported. So there is general dismay that it is not going to survive the
moratorium.'
Officially the DTI says there is no moratorium on new research programmes.
Until Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has decided
the department's 1993-94 innovation budget, 'officials are taking a cautious
line', the department said.
The heads of several research organisations insist that they have been told
privately by DTI officials that 'there will be no money for anything new
until the end of 1993-94', as one executive said.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Casino's change in tactics proves a winner: A company's
fight for licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPANIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO the great relief of its bankers and investors, and even more so its
croupiers, London Clubs International has made a clean sweep in securing new
gaming licences for its London casinos.
Last week the company was granted a new licence for the Sportsman in
Tottenham Court Road, having previously won new licences for its four
Mayfair casinos - the Ritz Club, Les Ambassadeurs, the Rendezvous and the
Palm Beach, plus the Golden Nugget in Piccadilly. Together, the six casinos
account for about two fifths of the drop (money wagered) in the capital's
casinos, which totals more than Pounds 1bn a year.
As it happened, those events coincided with the arrival of a new chairman at
the Gaming Board, Lady Littler, formerly an assistant under-secretary of
state.
A new phase appears to be dawning in British gaming.
The London Clubs case is significant in that a new procedure has been
introduced in casino regulation.
In nearly all previous cases when casino management was judged by the police
and Gaming Board as 'not fit and proper' - the verdict on London Clubs in
March this year after an earlier raid on its Mayfair casinos - the company
went out of business. Its assets were sold or transferred to a new operator.
London Clubs found a different way to play the hand. The company decided to
seek new certificates of consent after talks between the company's
non-executive directors - who were anxious to save the banks' and other
investors' money - and the Gaming Board.
If successful, it could apply for new licences, while agreeing, at the same
time, to relinquish its existing - allegedly tainted - licences.
The licensing hearings were informed that London Clubs had been completely
restructured, with a new chairman - Sir Gordon Booth, a former diplomat -
new directors, new shareholders, new managers and new methods of compliance.
In due course, new licences were granted.
Other operators in the gaming industry are interpreting the case as a
precedent, but that is not the view of the Gaming Board.
Its officials maintain that they were 'very confident' of their case against
London Clubs and were prepared to substantiate charges against the company,
had the licensing justices so ruled.
The issue may yet go to court if Mr John Aspinall, the rival casino owner,
succeeds in his appeal to the High Court that granting new licences in this
way was an evasion of the Gaming Act.
Lady Littler says the board will not hesitate to attack casino licences
where necessary and justifiable. But she adds that the board 'does not seek
the closure of casinos, with all that that would entail, merely as a
punitive measure, if problems can be eliminated effectively and propriety
restored by less draconian measures'.
London Clubs is delighted to retain its position as the capital's leading
casino group; the board is satisfied it has achieved its regulatory
objectives in full; and casino staff are relieved to keep their jobs.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Lionhope scheme to be scaled down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACKERS OF a controversial Pounds 500m package of commercial and residential
developments in one of the south-east's unemployment blackspots are
proposing a scaled-down version to address environmental objections, Andrew
Baxter writes.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, and Citibank, the US bank, are discussing
with the government, councils and environmental groups a new version of the
Lionhope plan on and around the Isle of Sheppey in north-east Kent.
The 'son of Lionhope' proposal is the latest move in a saga that began with
the administrative receivership in 1989 of the developer Lionhope (Kent),
which devised the original project.
The plans were rejected in July by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary,
after a public inquiry in 1990 during which environmentalists condemned the
effect on local wildlife. In September, Touche Ross - Lionhope's receiver -
said it would challenge the decision in the High Court.
The projects' promoters have been discussing revised proposals with Kent
County Council, Swale Borough Council, English Nature and the Royal Society
for the Protection of Birds. The revised plan, based on four sites, still
hopes to create 9,000 jobs, and a big expansion of Sheerness Dock, remains
mostly unchanged.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Rises for directors average 5% this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY DIRECTORS' pay rises have averaged 5 per cent in the past 12 months
and are expected to slow to an average of 4 per cent in the coming year, a
survey by Reward Group and the Institute of Directors says.
The survey is believed to be the largest to date covering directors' pay. It
is published in the wake of the government's appeal to senior executives to
award themselves low pay rises and its announcement that public-sector
workers face a pay ceiling of 1.5 per cent. It shows that 16 per cent of
directors expect no increase.
Mr Blenyth Jenkins, IoD corporate affairs director, said: 'It is clear from
this survey that the large and apparently unjustified increases which have
recently attracted so much media attention are wholly unrepresentative.'
The survey of more than 6,000 directors shows that women directors averaged
7.1 per cent increases over the same period but continued to earn less than
their male peers.
Pay for managing directors working in London is nearly 20 per cent above the
national median while their counterparts in the south-west are paid 13 per
cent below the national median.
More than half of all directors received pay rises of 5 per cent or less and
35 per cent had rises of 4 per cent or less. Of those, 14 per cent received
no pay rise and 1 per cent accepted pay cuts.
The number of directors driving company cars has dropped from 84 per cent to
79 per cent over the past 12 months.
Pay appears to increase with company turnover and individual responsibility
levels. Managing directors of companies with turnover of more than Pounds
200m are paid an average of Pounds 107,500 plus a bonus worth Pounds 18,000.
More than 90 per cent have a company car.
The average salary for managing directors of companies turning over between
Pounds 20m and Pounds 250m is now Pounds 78,045, plus a bonus worth Pounds
11,000. More than 95 per cent have a company car, 29 per cent of them
Jaguars.
Managing directors of companies with turnovers of up to Pounds 25m are paid
an average of Pounds 46,000, plus a bonus worth Pounds 6,800. More than 95
per cent have a company car, with 13 per cent driving a Mercedes.
The Directors' Reward Survey. Reward Group, Reward House, Diamond Way, Stone
Business Park, Stone, Staffs. ST15 OSD. Pounds 350.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Public pay throws up quirks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY public-sector workers are expected to receive pay increases of more
than the government limit of 1.5 per cent next year because automatic
incremental rises, linked to seniority, will be paid to some groups in
addition to their basic pay rise.
Union leaders have criticised some of the anomalies in the implementation of
the pay squeeze which may also mean that some workers will get less than 1.5
per cent.
Mr Jack Dromey, a national secretary with the TGWU general union, said: 'The
implementation of this squeeze is shot full of inconsistencies - they're
just making it up as they go along.'
Mr Dromey cited the fact that the 70,000 industrial civil servants will
receive bonuses and special recruitment payments in addition to the 1.5 per
cent while workers in the executive agencies will have to include
performance bonuses within the 1.5 per cent ceiling.
The extent to which performance pay will be included in, or additional to,
the limit is not always clear. The pay review body covering nurses has been
asked not to proceed with its investigation of performance pay over the next
12 months. That means nurses will continue to receive incremental rises as
they move up the seniority scale.
For civil servants, the situation is much less clear, as most groups have
recently agreed new performance pay arrangements. Union leaders hope that
any performance pay will be on top of the minimum rise.
Inland Revenue staff are in a particularly anomalous position as they have
no pay agreement at all. The main tax union, the IRSF, is negotiating a new
one, but relations with the Inland Revenue have been put under strain by
market testing. The union is organising an industrial action ballot against
market testing.
In local government, the employers have been discussing various options from
a total freeze to targeting most of the increase on the lower-paid. The most
likely outcome, though, is a 1.5 per cent rise across the board, with normal
incremental rises for white-collar staff.
For many local authorities, redundancies will still be required because the
government has built in an assumption of job reductions into its pay bill
calculations.
In the NHS, the new hospital and ambulance trusts, which have the freedom to
set local pay and conditions for newly recruited staff, appear ready to toe
the government's line on pay.
West Dorset Mental Health NHS Trust, which this year agreed a local
performance-related deal with unions, which also abolished annual
increments, said: 'We will not increase our total wage bill by more than 1.5
per cent, and how we distribute that will be a matter of negotiations with
the unions.'
Northumbria Ambulance Trust, among the most radical in its approach to local
pay and conditions, said it had not started negotiations for next year but
would work within the 1.5 per cent limit. Earlier this year, before the
government set the 1.5 per cent limit, personnel officers from trusts
expressed anxiety about levels of nationally determined pay awards.
Traditionally those have been at the top end of pay rises. The national
association of health service personnel said that trusts might be faced with
choosing pay or jobs if forced to pay awards recommended by pay review
bodies.

Mr Josef Ackermann, 44, replaces Mr Robert Jeker, who is leaving the bank
'on the best of terms' to become managing director of Anova, Nueva and
Unotec, Mr Stephan Schmidheiny's three investment and holding companies.
The shuffle comes only three months after a similar change of command at
Swiss Bank Corporation. Both banks earlier this year saw their credit
ratings downgraded a notch from the cherished triple A by Moody's, the
rating service.
Mr Ackermann entered Credit Suisse in 1978, and has worked in corporate

Mr Jeker's departure helps ease the succession at the bank. Mr Rainer Gut,

FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Labour MP seeks probe into Clarke Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR MP last night urged the government to launch an investigation into
the collapse of Clarke Foods, Britain's second largest ice-cream
manufacturer, which went into administrative receivership last October
leaving debts of about Pounds 25m.
Mr George Howarth, MP for Knowsley North and former Labour frontbench
housing spokesman, also questioned share sales by chairman Mr Henry D Clarke
and fellow director Mr Martin Riley.
The two directors sold shares from their pension funds weeks before the
share price began a steady fall to the suspension price of 8p.
Mr Neil Hamilton, Corporate affairs Minister, agreed to request an interim
report from the receivers, Robson Rhodes, while describing Mr Howarth's
request for an official investigation under the Companies Act as premature.
Mr Howarth, whose constituency includes the Clarke factory in Merseyside
which was briefly occupied by angry workers following the receivership, was
speaking in a Commons debate on redundancies at the company.
He also said that Nestle, the foods group which bought much of the business
and assets of Clarke, had decided to close the Merseyside factory.
He alleged that Mr Clarke and Mr Riley 'clearly must have known that Clarke
Foods was in severe difficulties' at the time they sold the shares. 'Were Mr
Clarke and Mr Riley guilty of insider dealing?' he asked.
The Labour MP called for the interim report to include 'any preliminary
evidence of fraud and/or insider dealing'.
Mr Howarth also asked for an investigation into the state of Pounds 1.4m
allocated for severance and pension payments to employees at one of Clarke's
factories.
Mr Howarth finally called on the government to launch an inquiry in to the
fitness of Mr Clarke to be a director of a UK quoted company.

A SERIES of new contracts helped Vega Group, the space engineering
specialist, report a 22 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds
631,000 in the company's first set of figures since its flotation in June.
Turnover for the six months to October 31 was Pounds 3.62m (Pounds 2.76m)
and earnings per share were 2.9p (2.5p). The interim dividend is 0.87p.
'The company remains relatively unaffected by the current economic
recession,' said Mr John Rigg, chairman.
During the period, the company won contracts worth about Pounds 3m which
were in excess of the Pounds 15m of contracts included in the placing
document.
Customers include the Ministry of Defence, the European Commission and the
European Space Agency.
Current trading was strong, said Mr Rigg. 'We have no borrowing and we
expect to continue to generate cash.'
He did not rule out the possibility of acquisitions and had looked at
takeover targets in the UK and the rest of Europe. No takeover talks were
yet under way.
The shares lost 2p to 122p.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURVIVAL chances of Trans World Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier owned
by Mr Carl Icahn, improved yesterday after he agreed to give up control of
the airline and provide financial support to it.
The former corporate raider reached the deal with the airline's creditors,
its three unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal
agency which is required to guarantee payments from TWA's underfunded
pension plans.
Mr Icahn, who holds a majority of TWA's shares as well as certain debt
securities, will relinquish control over the airline and abandon all claims
relating to it.
If the company's formal reorganisation plan is approved next year, ownership
will pass to the company's three unions and unsecured creditors.
The unions will receive 45 per cent of the equity in the airline, in return
for a cut of 15 per cent in wages and benefits. The unsecured creditors will
share the remaining 55 per cent, in return for forgiving about Dollars 1bn
of claims. Mr Icahn or his private interests will also provide Dollars 200m
of short-term financing to TWA.
The US pensions agency, which guarantees about Dollars 730m of TWA's
benefits, says the airline's plans are underfunded by Dollars 1.05bn
overall. Under the agreement, these pension plans will be frozen, and Mr
Icahn will become their 'sponsor', or responsible for their financial
performance.
TWA will issue a Dollars 300m note, paying interest at an annual rate of 11
per cent over 15 years, to help make up the funding requirements. Mr Icahn
or his private interests must then supplement these payments by Dollars 20m
annually for four years.
Yesterday, the various parties said a plan of reorganisation should be filed
with the bankruptcy court in January, which could allow the airline to move
out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection next year.
This could pave the way for the proposed sale of international assets to a
combined USAir-British Airways, subject to approval from US regulatory
authorities.

<TEXT>
JENSEN Car Company, the past purveyor of hand-assembled luxury sports cars
is passing out of the hands of Grant Thornton, the receivers, to a
consortium of undisclosed English businessmen for an undisclosed sum, it was
announced yester-day.
The nameless consortium is planning to resurrect the Jensen Interceptor. A
new version of the car had been announced early this year - when it found
just one customer.
The consortium also plans to install at the Jensen factory in West Bromwich
a new industrial division making undisclosed but patented DIY household
products under licence.
Grant Thornton, amid much talk of saving 'a great name in British
engineering,' said that contracts for the sale of Jensen as a going concern
had been exchanged and that the deal would be completed by Christmas.
Jensen, previously owned by Unicon Holdings of Stockport, collapsed in
September with debts of Pounds 638,000, a 32,000 sq ft factory, some
goodwill, a mass of tools, some spare parts, one M-registered Jensen and one
old sports car, partly rebuilt. Grant Thornton said then that the company
was difficult to value.
The 20-strong Jensen workforce is remaining in place. Mr David Heseltine,
the general manager of the company and barrier between the world and the
anonymous investors, promised that another 15 more people would be hired for
the industrial operation and that the carmaking staff would double at the
end of next year.
Mr Heseltine talked in terms of turnover at Pounds 3m in the 15 months to
March 1994 and Pounds 10m in the following year, reduced overheads because
of the new industrial production and research and development spending.
Against the background of that glossy prospect, he disclosed that he had no
orders for the Interceptor, just 'six to eight people with a genuine
interest.'

FT  08 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lord Chancellor breaks deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, used his powers last night to resolve a
tied vote by peers. The 106-106 division came on a technical amendment on
procedure.
Tory Lord Aldington, chairman of the European committee, called for the body
to determine its own sub-committee structure as its work covered complex EC
documents. He moved a change to a report from the Lords liaison committee,
which regulates Upper House committees.
The Lord Chancellor, after the deadlock was announced, said the rules
provided that 'the question should be resolved in the negative unless there
is a majority in its favour' and he declared that the proposed change was
defeated.

There are two other English branches outside London - in Bath and Bristol -

<TEXT>
INMOS, the UK-based semi-conductor company, is forming a new company with
QPL International Holdings, a Hong Kong-based electronic components maker,
which will enable it to keep open its south Wales factory and save 220 jobs.
The new company, Newport Wafer Fab, will be 70 per cent owned by QPL and 30
per cent by Inmos, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SGS-Thomson, the
Franco-Italian semiconductor group. The Welsh Office is providing regional
selective assistance.
In addition, QPL expects to create 280 jobs over the next three years by
upgrading the facility, and more than treble annual output at Newport by
1996.
QPL will offer semiconductor foundry services to companies that design
semiconductors but do not own a manufacturing facility. The company has
foundries in the US and in Japan.
The deal shows the growth of Far Eastern companies in electronics. QPL, a
subcontractor of Inmos and SGS-Thomson, has raised turnover by 44 per cent
to more than HKDollars 1bn (Pounds 85.6m), with profits in excess of
HKDollars 171m.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Walker insists funds for coal review are sufficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD WALKER, the former Conservative cabinet minister selected to oversee
the regeneration of coalfield areas, insisted yesterday that the Pounds 165m
allocated by the government was sufficient for the task in the coming 12
months.
On his first public visit to a coalfield since his appointment in October,
Lord Walker said he wanted more government money to continue the
regeneration effort - using his first-year experience to assess how much was
needed.
'As far as future years are concerned, when I've got down to the detail of
the task I would discuss with the government departments what was required,'
he said.
Suggestions that the funding was inadequate were a myth, he said. 'I have a
reputation of not being backward in asking for money I need.'
Citing his track record as Welsh secretary, Lord Walker said successful
regeneration programmes did not increase public expenditure, since they
reduced unemployment and social security payments and brought in taxpaying
activities.
The appointment of Lord Walker, energy secretary during the 1984-85 miners'
strike, to lead coalfield regeneration was announced by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, after the public outcry over the
proposed closure of 31 pits.
Yesterday's visit to the Durham coalfield was at the invitation of the local
authorities' East Durham task force. A year ago the task force said the area
needed Pounds 158m investment to have any chance of recovery from 10,000
mining jobs losses since 1981. It now faces the closure of its last two
pits, employing more than 2,000 men.
Lord Walker disclosed that he recently privately visited the Nottinghamshire
and west Midlands coalfields. He emphasised that his visits did not pre-empt
the outcome of the government's pit closures review.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Lionhope Pounds 500m development to be scaled down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACKERS of a controversial Pounds 500m package of commercial and residential
developments in one of the south-east's unemployment blackspots are
proposing a scaled-down version to address environmental objections.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, and Citibank, the US bank, are discussing
with the government, local authorities and environmental groups a new
version of the Lionhope plan on and around the Isle of Sheppey in north-east
Kent.
The 'son of Lionhope' proposal is the latest twist in a saga that began with
the administrative receivership in 1989 of the developer Lionhope (Kent),
which devised the original project. The plans were rejected in July by Mr
Michael Howard, the environment secretary, after a 13-week public inquiry in
1990 during which environmentalists condemned the effect on local wildlife.
In September, Touche Ross - Lionhope's receiver - said it would challenge
the decision in the High Court.
The projects' promoters have been discussing revised proposals with Kent
County Council, Swale Borough Council and the main objectors, English Nature
and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
Mr Tony Houghton, joint administrative receiver, said yesterday he was
'quite confident that we have put forward a proposal that fully meets
objections raised at the public inquiry.' The revised plan, based on four
sites, still hopes to create 9,000 jobs, and one of its key elements, a big
expansion of Sheerness Dock, remains unchanged.
A proposed privately funded tunnel under the Swale, linking Sheppey to the
mainland, will be replaced with a bridge, to be funded mainly by the
government.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Treasury calls in a clutch of flamboyant forecasters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the best-known and most controversial economists in the country join
the panel which will advise Mr John Major and his ministers about economic
forecasting. One of them, Professor Patrick Minford is on the record as
saying that the Treasury has 'lost its grasp' of economic principles.
The creation of the panel of seven is part of an attempt to improve the
accuracy of the Treasury's forecasts and to open up its forecasting
activities to the scrutiny of outsiders.
Panel members will not just give views on how they think the economy will
perform. They will also be invited to comment on detailed policy matters.
Peter Marsh profiles the panel's members.
Prof Wynne Godley, Professor of Applied Economics at Cambridge University
Has since the 1970s predicted long-term problems for the UK economy arising
from weakness in manufacturing and tendency for UK to suffer large
current-account deficits. Nicknamed 'Gloomy Boots' by students, his lectures
can sometimes be hard to understand. His forecast in May 1991 that the UK
economy would contract by 2.7 per cent last year and by a further 0.9 per
cent this year has turned out more accurate that any other projection by a
mainstream British economist.
Andrew Sentance, economics director, Confederation of British Industry
At 34, the youngest member of the forecasting panel. Has worked for six
years in CBI's economics department; noted for his ruminative style but not
the most scintillating public speaker. Did his doctorate at London School of
Economics on 'government as an employer'. Before that was management trainee
at National Coal Board, and a manager at a petrol station. Has led CBI
research in past two years on putting the case for more government action to
help manufacturing. Also an expert on government statistics.
Prof Patrick Minford, Professor of Applied Economics at Liverpool University
Former Treasury economist and another member of the monetarist Liverpool
Six. Like Congdon, scornful of Treasury performance in analysing the economy
but disagrees with him about the correct way to measure the money supply.
Ardent free-market thinker who says he would have liked to have been
Gladstone, the tariff-cutting 19th-century UK chancellor. More accurate than
most economists in recognising early on the extent of the recession, was not
particularly prescient in warning of the late 1980s boom.
Andrew Britton, director, National Institute of Economic and Social Research
Thoughtful though dour economist who for past 10 years has headed what is
probably Britain's best-known economic forecasting organisation outside the
Treasury. Interested in important though not always fashionable areas such
as factory training. Worked for Treasury for 16 years until taking up job at
institute. Not afraid to criticise Treasury; thinks it should be split into
two to separate public spending and economic policy roles. Patchy
forecasting record. He is now among the relative optimists about UK economic
growth next year.
Prof Tim Congdon, managing director, Lombard Street Research
Former journalist on The Times who has shot to prominence in recent years
for espousing monetarist theories and fierce criticism of Treasury's
economic analysis. Started forecasting in mid 1980s with London stockbroker
L. Messel, and warned correctly of high inflation in late 1980s as a result
of housing boom. Over past three years has turned out trenchant comments
about economic scene under the banner of his own independent economic
research body. Member of Liverpool Six, monetarists who campaigned for UK to
leave the EMS.
Prof David Currie, head of economic forecasting, London Business School.
Well-connected economist who in mid 1980s informally advised Mr Roy
Hattersley, then Labour shadow chancellor. Has advised the Treasury, Bank of
England and International Monetary Fund and is now in fifth year of running
LBS's economic forecasting unit. In recent years LBS's forecasting record
has been poor, although it is thought the inclusion of Currie in the panel
and its exposure to competitive forces in the forecasting business might
sharpen performance. On good terms with Sir Terry Burns and Professor Alan
Budd of the Treasury.
Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist, Goldman Sachs
The thinking person's economist; former Downing Street adviser in 1970s
Labour government; has since made his fortune in the City with one of the
world's top-rated investment banks. Rarely at a loss for a cogent phrase on
the economy, Davies is one of the slickest performers in the forecasting
community and is highly rated in the Treasury. Was too quick to forecast an
imminent recovery at the end of last year; now reckons demand picking up but
likely recovery next year will probably be patchy. Sees opportunities for
further cuts in interest rates.

Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
The South African Press Association said yesterday Mr Congo Jibril, a leader

FT  08 DEC 92 / Accord reached on airline landing slots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community transport ministers agreed early today on a system
designed to help smaller airlines get better access to landing slots at
major EC airports, EC officials said, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The system tightens rules under which airlines lose slots they don't use,
but falls short of a proposal to confiscate slots from major airlines to
make room for smaller ones.
As a result, it is likely to be criticised by smaller airlines such as
British Midland and Virgin Atlantic which have campaigned for firm EC action
to help them compete on the EC market and offer lower fares in time for the
EC's January 1 single market deadline.
Under the accord, which must be formalised at a future meeting of EC
ministers, airlines holding fewer than four slots at a particular airport
will qualify for slots which become available under the system.
The rules would be especially needed at the heavily congested airports of
Paris Orly, London Heathrow and Frankfurt.
EC transport ministers yesterday agreed to explore emergency steps to rescue
EC airline companies from their current crisis and set minimum fare prices,
according to French Transport Minister Jean-Louis Bianco.
He said that between 1990 and 1993 the air transport sector was expected to
lose about Dollars 10bn and that the crisis, harmful in the short term for
airlines, could soon be detrimental to passengers too.
Citing steps that could be taken, the French minister said the EC could
invoke a safeguard clause enabling it to put a floor under fare prices and
protect EC airlines from 'ruinous competition'.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Indian forces rout militants at mosque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA and STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN police early today stormed a disputed site in Ayodhya where thousands
of Hindu militants destroyed an ancient mosque on Sunday.
Four battalions, numbering 5,000 police, and a rapid action commando force
used tear gas and rubber bullets but there were no casualties. They met
little resistance although militants stoned them as they approached.
Delhi decided on a resolute show of force after the destruction of the
mosque, in northern India, provoked communal violence throughout the country
in which at least 220 people were killed. Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, was due to make a statement in parliament this morning. He
yesterday faced intense criticism for his failure to protect the mosque at a
weekend rally called by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP),
the main opposition party.
At dawn today the government arrested the leader of the BJP, Mr LK Advani,
who yesterday took responsibility for the assault and resigned as
parliamentary opposition leader.
The officer in charge of the Ayodhya operation, Mr PN Ramakrishnan, said:
'The boys have been very fast and very smart. We simply scared them.' The
police then secured control of the town itself and despatched the militants
on buses and trucks to the nearby city of Lucknow.
There had been fears of a bloody confrontation with the estimated 50,000
extremists who had seized the sacred Hindu site, where a mosque was built in
the 16th century.
The government was urged yesterday to ban militant religious organisations,
including the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad,
the extremist groups which support the BJP.
Despite demands from MPs from other opposition parties for Mr Rao's
resignation, it seemed that the ruling Congress (I) party would rally around
the prime minister for the sake of stability. Congress blamed the BJP for
the assault and condemned it as 'the greatest political tragedy which has
overtaken the nation since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi'.
Protests from abroad included condemnation from Pakistan, where the
government called a nationwide strike for today.
Moslem MPs urged the government to rebuild the mosque as a shrine to
national reconciliation. They were supported by many Congress MPs. However,
it was difficult to see how it could be rebuilt in the face of intense Hindu
opposition.
Across India, the army was deployed and curfews imposed in several areas as
communal riots swept through almost every state, and the toll of victims -
mainly Moslems - mounted rapidly. In Bombay more than 40 people died in
clashes involving 10,000 protesters.
There was also violence in Ahmedabad, New Delhi and the walled city of
Jaipur. Calcutta was paralysed by a strike called by trade unionists.
Tensions spilled over during the day to India's predominantly Moslem
neighbours, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Barclays to review chairman and chief executive joint role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW BUXTON, chief executive of Barclays Bank, promised yesterday that
the bank would respond to shareholder pressure to split the roles of
chairman and chief executive by devising a new senior management structure.
Mr Buxton said it would alter its corporate governance 'in the long-term'.
This might mean appointing a new chief executive after he becomes chairman
in January, or giving the power to dismiss the chairman to a committee of
non-executive directors.
'In the long-term, we will take notice of what shareholders are saying, and
we will take steps to split the job,' Mr Buxton said in an interview. He
said institutional investors had signalled acceptance of this in meetings
with the bank.
He said he could not specify when a decision would be made. Controversy over
the dual role had only emerged in the past two months, and a company the
size and complexity of Barclays could not alter its management structure
'without thinking through the ramifications'.
The disclosure follows criticism of Barclays' decision to combine the roles
by a number of institutional investors. The controversy has grown with
speculation that the bank could be forced to cut its final dividend because
of poor results.
The combining of the roles of chairman and chief executive at Barclays has
been made more controversial by debate over Sir Adrian Cadbury's report on
British corporate governance, which was published last week.
An early version of the report said it would be preferable for companies not
to combine the roles. The published report calls for 'a clearly accepted
division of responsibilities . . . which will ensure a balance of power and
authority'.
Mr Buxton said he was 'unlikely' to become chief executive under a new
chairman. But the bank would consider a suggestion from investors that he
might become executive chairman reporting to a committee of non-executives.
'I think that kind of thing might be quite possible,' he said. The bank had
to consider the best way of altering its proposed structure under which four
heads of divisions - three of them titled 'chief executive' - will report to
him.
Mr Buxton said the bank had already started to put in place new strategies
to restore its profitability over the next five years. But he believed that
it would take two years before it achieved the changes that he wanted to
implement.
'I think 1993 is going to be a year of recovery, I do not think it is going
to be a year of prosperity,' he said. The bank was likely to have
'relatively high provisions' in the next financial year in spite of signs of
economic recovery. Mr Buxton said the bank would consider the likely pattern
of future profitability in deciding whether to maintain its final dividend.

<TEXT>
FRANCE formally notified the other 11 European Community states yesterday it
might veto a key farm trade deal with Washington which defused the threat of
a transatlantic trade war and paved the way for a global free-trade accord,
Reuter reports from Brussels.
Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, entered in the minutes of a
meeting of EC ministers a declaration saying France would defend its 'very
important interests'.
The statement implicitly recognised that EC governments were likely to have
to decide on the farm trade deal alone.
'France considers the draft farm agreement struck on November 20 1992 by the
(European) Commission representatives (with US negotiators) goes beyond the
mandate set by the Council (of EC ministers). . . and would have
unacceptable consequences for France's agricultural economy,' the statement
said.
France considered the draft to be 'incompatible' with the Common
Agricultural Policy and said that if the Council of Ministers had to take a
position on such arrangements, Paris would oppose it to safeguard domestic
interests.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (12): Products before geography -
Profile, The derivatives operation at Bankers Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 38, Mr Brian Walsh may seem a bit young to be running the global capital
markets group of Bankers Trust, but as the executive in charge of the bank's
derivatives business, he is operating in a market that is itself remarkably
precocious.
Mr Walsh estimates that the over-the-counter derivatives business is no more
than eight or nine years old - 'not yet in adolescence'. In a short space of
time, the market has experienced extraordinary growth, as has Bankers
Trust's own operations - and those of any other big bank or securities house
involved in the market.
When Mr Walsh joined the company seven years ago, the derivatives group was
still in its infancy and employed no more than 70 professionals. Today, more
than 300 derivatives specialists occupy the front office, supported by
almost twice as many back-office staff who handle the processing, accounting
and reporting of the transactions booked by the bank.
At Bankers Trust, its derivatives operations are organised globally and
managed out of the bank's Manhattan head office. Mr Walsh says: 'I'm here in
New York, but I could be in London, I could be in Tokyo - it makes no
difference.'
This is because the business is not divided up geographically, but by
product lines, so that there is an interest-rate or a currency-swap book
that is passed around the bank's international offices, and kept entirely
separate from the cash businesses that underly the derivatives.
Bankers Trust's derivatives group serves about 500 clients, of whom roughly
200 have especially active accounts. The clients are split into three
groupings: financial institutions, corporations and investors. Whereas, four
years ago, financial institutions took up the bulk of the business, today
the bank does more business with investors (such as pension funds, money
managers, mutual funds and insurance companies) than with any other
category.
Mr Walsh says that the vast bulk - about 80 per cent - of his department's
business is client-related, which means that Bankers Trust relies less on
proprietary derivatives trading than many of its rivals. The bank does not
break down its earnings from derivatives in its quarterly and annual
reports, but people familiar with Bankers Trust estimate that the
derivatives group produces about 25 per cent of the bank's total
non-interest revenues, which last year reached Dollars 2.5bn.
In terms of the size of its business, according to ratings agency Standard &amp;
Poor's, Bankers Trust has the fourth biggest exposure to derivatives among
US banks. The notional amount of outstanding contracts in its portfolio at
the end of June was Dollars 958bn. Their market value - the cost to Bankers
Trust of replacing those contracts in the event of a counterparty default -
was Dollars 21.6bn, a relatively high risk profile for the bank's size, says
S &amp; P, because it is more involved than most in riskier commodity and equity
contracts.
Like the rest of the market, Bankers Trust came to derivatives in the early
and mid-1980s, beginning with interest rate, and then currency swaps, which
at the time seemed complex and daring financial instruments to both bankers
and their clients.
After initially concentrating on 'back-to-back' transactions, and playing
the role of the intermediary bringing both sides of the deal together, it
was not long before Bankers Trust began acting as a principal. This was a
significant change, because it gave birth to a new era of risk management
within firms - the hedging and managing of the derivatives book.
During the 1980s, the bank followed a growth path that was familiar
throughout the industry. After swaps came interest-rate and currency
options, instruments that, because of their complexity, says Mr Walsh,
attracted many bright mathematicians and physicists to the business - the
'rocket scientists' of financial folklore - and 'bred a culture of
innovation'.
By mid-1987, Bankers Trust and other players had begun searching for new
asset forms upon which to build new derivatives business. At the time, the
bank was taking a long, hard look at the traditional equities markets. The
financial deregulation of Big Bang in London was barely a year old, and US
banks and securities houses were eagerly snapping up UK jobbing and broking
firms, or opening big offices in the City. At home, US houses were earning
enormous profits from their basic equities broking and trading businesses.
Bankers Trust, however, decided to 'focus on something we knew', in
equities, says Mr Walsh. What it knew was derivatives, and the new business
'took off like a rocket,' enabling the bank to make money from the first day
from products such as Japanese warrants and Japanese convertibles.
One of Bankers Trust' most successful innovations in this area has been the
Equity Protected Note, a zero-coupon index-linked note that protects
investors' downside but offers a lot of upside potential. The banks has sold
billions of dollars of the notes all over the world, not just to
institutions but to small individual investors.
The market soon turned its attention to commodities. Here, however,
regulatory constraints held back development, although the start of the Gulf
crisis in 1990 persuaded many corporate clients that commodity derivatives
had a role to play in risk management. Bankers Trust is currently doing a
lot of work in the energy field with oil company clients.
Credit derivatives is another new field that Bankers Trust is eagerly
ploughing. So far, it has completed about 15 transactions, employing a
handful of products, and it is also working on insurance derivatives to help
insurers manage their risk more effectively.
While much of the action today is concentrated on such 'esoteric
instruments' as equity, commodity and credit derivatives, companies like
Bankers Trust continue to work on the more traditional 'plain-vanilla'
products, re-engineering interest rate and currency swaps to fit clients'
needs.
Over the past decade, Bankers Trust has had its share of misses alongside
the hits, including one-off ideas that never worked. Some of the bank's
established lines of business have also run into hard times - the commodity
derivatives market, for example, is currently plagued by a lack of
volatility in the underlying cash products.
Overall, however, Mr Walsh is proud to say that Bankers Trust has so far
never withdrawn from a new initiative or market because of losses.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (10): Currency upheaval wins converts
 -The corporate users, the variety of applications is widening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY COMPANIES have now been using derivative products of various sorts for
more than a decade. They have advanced further down this route than
investment managers, but there is still considerable scope for growth.
Most large companies - such as BP, which runs its large treasury operation
as a separate bank - are already sophisticated users of derivatives. But
smaller companies are also venturing into the market.
Meanwhile, the variety of applications is widening, with a number of
companies now hedging their exposure to commodity prices, as well as the
interest rate and foreign exchange movements. However, many companies remain
rather cautious about using so-called 'exotic' options, which involve
complex variations to shift exposure.
In a recent survey, in the financial monthly Institutional Investor, more
than a third of US companies questioned said they use derivatives to hedge
overseas investments.
More than 82 per cent had been using derivatives for more than two years,
including 12 per cent for more than 10 years. Interest rate swaps are the
most popular instruments (79 per cent use them), while 40 per cent use
foreign exchange options and 64 per cent use foreign exchange forwards.
The turmoil in Europe's foreign currency markets this autumn has created
more converts. Treasurers can no longer feel comfortable with large
exposures to foreign currencies, even within supposedly fixed-exchange rate
systems.
Companies are 'suddenly much more aware of the risks. The dealings and
profits which a company has at any moment can be wiped out in hours, let
alone days,' according to Mr Les Halpin, a director of Record Treasury
Management.
A survey by the management consultants Touche Ross showed that 85 per cent
of companies had selective hedging cover last year. Interest has grown even
more sharply in recent months. 'We advise 25 of the FT-SE 100 companies, and
quite a large number have increased their hedging activity since Black
Wednesday,' said Mr Derek Ross, a Touche Ross partner.
Currency risk management is no longer relevant only to exporters and
importers, because many companies now have overseas operations.
Derivative products allow companies to fix costs and income flows in
advance, which is particularly valuable for companies under pressures as a
result of economic recession.
But companies are also aware of the risks inherent in the use of these
complex financial instruments.
The loss of Pounds 150m in foreign exchange dealings last year by the
treasury department of Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, clearly
illustrated the potential dangers, if corporate treasury operations are not
carefully controlled. The problem stemmed from the practice of writing
currency options, which can lead to unlimited losses. Usually, only banks,
which manage their risks on a continuous basis, take on that sort of
exposure.
But paradoxically, the recent turmoil in the foreign exchange market could
encourage some companies to take greater risks. Those companies which hedged
foreign currency exposure by buying options before the start of the
onslaught in the summer were able to buy options cheaply. That is because
the largely successful operation of the exchange rate mechanism, until that
point, had reduced volatility in the foreign exchange market. Since
volatility - historic and implied - is a key component in the pricing of
options, companies who bought options earlier this year, and were then
protected during the subsequent upsurge in volatility, got excellent value
for money.
However, the extremely volatile market conditions which have persisted
during the autumn have pushed option prices through the roof. In addition to
the greater volatility, prices have been edged higher by some banks which
had suffered losses by selling options cheaply in the past.
Now, the expense of buying options is proving prohibitive for some
companies. Treasury operations which are operated as profit centres rather
than cost centres are particularly loath to pay up.
Instead, many more are opting for 'dynamic' hedging, which involves managing
risk on a continuous basis, by using the forward and spot foreign exchange
markets.
Treasurers have also been finding their interest rate exposure more
difficult to manage, due to difficult market conditions. Swap market rates
have generally been unattractive, making it harder than ever for companies
to borrow cheaply.
During the 1980s, companies were able to borrow at levels well below the
London interbank offered rate (Libor), by swapping the fixed-rate money they
raised through bond offerings into floating-rate financing. Now, only the
best-rated borrowers can hope to do this.
In the US, borrowers have been unwilling to lock themselves into medium-term
fixed-rate interest costs, given that short-term rates are extremely low,
and rates are expected to ease further. The result has been a lack of
companies or institutions willing to pay the fixed-rate leg of a swap
agreement, reducing opportunities to manage interest rate exposure through
the swaps market.
'Swaps and bonds have become much more closely correlated. Those who want
cheap funding are now having to take risks to get it,' said Mr Nick Burge,
executive director at Nomura International.
However, one benefit of the Allied Lyons debacle was that it prompted many
companies to strengthen the ties between the treasury operation and the rest
of the company, especially the main board. As more complex derivative
products are introduced, stringent controls become imperative.
The crux of the matter is that the job of the treasurer is to 'keep the
company's options open, so it can launch a new product or open a new
factory,' believes Mr Gerald Leahy, director-general of the Association of
Corporate Treasurers.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (11): Higher return, no extra risks -
The investors / New uses for familiar instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACK IN 1987, it was called 'portfolio insurance', and was blamed in large
part for the collapse of share prices in New York and, by extension, around
the world.
Today, it is called 'dynamic asset allocation'. But it all adds up to the
same thing: an attempt by investors to use financial derivatives to protect
and enhance the value of their assets.
Fund managers have traditionally used derivatives for one of two purposes:
to protect themselves against losses on assets they are holding; or to shift
their exposure between markets quickly and cheaply.
Now, a third use of derivatives is taking hold: to generate a higher return
from a portfolio without increasing the risk profile. A growing number of
hedge funds are on offer to investors, employing trading strategies based on
derivatives to boost investment return. Such specialised vehicles are most
common in the US, and are slowly becoming fashionable in Europe.
Innate conservatism on the part of many investors makes such schemes
difficult to sell. 'It is almost impossible to get a German pension fund to
use options,' says Mr Jonas Martenson, of the Brussels-based Europtec fund,
which claims to have been the first Europe-wide hedge fund a year ago.
Institutions in the Netherlands, Sweden and UK are currently the most
susceptible to funds that specialise in options trading strategies, he says.
A further use of such investment techniques is to tailor the return on a
particular portfolio more closely to the fund manager's objectives. 'For
fund managers, the question is how you engineer a particular kind of pay-off
profile. The whole of option theory is about that,' says Prof Stewart
Hodges, director of the financial options research centre at the University
of Warwick.
At present, however, the bulk of fund managers use derivatives in only a
limited way, if at all. Stock index futures remain the main vehicle for
hedging equity market exposure, though some institutions have used other
ways of putting a floor under their investment portfolios. Royal Insurance
in the UK, for instance, paid around Pounds 7m for a put option in the run
up to the UK's general election earlier this year, to protect itself against
a stock market collapse.
Index futures also remain the favourite way of shifting exposure quickly
between markets, making it possible to avoid the heavy costs associated with
liquidating one equity portfolio and building another.
'If the market is big enough, it is entirely sensible for an institution
that wants to take a view, or change a position in a market rapidly, to use
futures,' says Mr David Wilkie of consulting actuaries R. Watson. 'You could
run a small portfolio without buying any shares at all. It's an economic way
of doing it.'
However, even this use of derivatives is frowned upon by many investment
managers. 'It enables you to take decisions too quickly,' says Mr Peter
Stanyer, head of investments at the British Rail pension fund. 'For it to be
expensive, and take time to shift assets from one market to another, may be
a good thing.'
While considerable resistance remains, the institutional obstacles to the
use of derivatives by fund managers have largely been dismantled in recent
years. The UK provides a good illustration of the advances that have been
made - and the drawbacks that remain.
The tax position of derivatives was cleared up in the 1990 Finance Act. Last
year, the Securities and Investment Board produced rules on 'efficient
portfolio management', outlining when the use of futures and options was an
acceptable practice. And earlier this year, the London Financial Futures and
Options Exchange published valuation guidelines intended to standardise
performance measurement for fund managers which use futures and options.
In practice, however, considerable obstacles and doubts remain. Liffe's
recommendation on the valuation of options, for instance, is not universally
accepted. 'They shouldn't be valued at market value, but on prudent lines,'
says Mr Wilkie. At the moment, 'different companies do it different ways and
no one has thought a lot about it,' he complains.
Nor have the SIB's regulations made it clear in all circumstances when
investment managers can use derivatives. It requires 'congruence' between an
underlying investment and a derivative used to hedge it - a vague term that
has the managers of unit trusts (open-ended mutual funds) scratching their
heads. Some have interpreted it to mean, for instance, that an equity
investor should not buy an index future unless its underlying portfolio has
at least a 90 per cent correlation to the index - highly unlikely for anyone
except the manager of an index-tracking fund.
Further interpretation of regulations lies ahead: the European Community's
third life assurance directive, for instance, will limit use of derivatives
to hedging, not speculation. Drawing the line between the two is likely to
exercise regulators' minds further.
While uncertainties like these remain, many investment managers and trustees
continue to stay away from the derivative markets, prefering not to bridge
the psychological (and educational) divide.
The psychological resistance stems in part from the fact that fund managers
are generally judged against their peers, rather than in the light of their
absolute investment return. 'Fund managers all want to be part of the herd,'
says Prof Hodges. 'They are all worried about tracking errors.'
When markets move sideways or down, that defensive approach to investment
management may no longer hold sway. Such an approach, however, is still a
long way off.

FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (9): Europe has something special to
offer - Managed futures, the superstitious fear of futures and options is
receding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BEVERLY CHANDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGED futures business, which recently started to take off in the US,
is also beginning to take root in Europe.
It is based on the controversial idea that derivtives constitute a separate
asset class, distinct from equities, bonds and commodities, and so represent
a crucial part of a balanced portfolio.
Worldwide - but principally in the US - there is an estimated Dollars 21bn
under management in managed futures programmes: money which represents both
institutional investments, such as pension funds and insurance funds, and
also savings from retail investors, both on and offshore.
The industry in Europe is estimated to be responsible for a mere Dollars 2bn
of this money, but that figure may be set to grow. Mr Micky St Aldwyn,
senior manager of institutional business development for E D &amp; F Man, the
oldest and biggest managed futures firm in Europe, says 1993 will be 'the
year when the European managed futures industry sees its biggest growth so
far'.
Globally, managed futures are enjoying something of a boom, mostly on the
back of claims that they offer diversification from the more traditional
investment fields of equities, bonds or cash, all of which have been
vulnerable to the vicissitudes of their markets in the past few years.
Suddenly, the superstitious dread with which many traditional investment
managers viewed investments in futures and options has started to lift.
Managed futures investments have shown themselves to be top performers
during periods that have been difficult for other types of investment.
However, there have also been periods when they have substantially
underperformed other sectors of the market.
Europe has shown itself to have something special to offer. The number of
derivatives exchanges in Europe has increased rapidly, resulting in more
products in which to invest. Beyond that, a consensus has developed across
the industry that the more established and familiar US derivative products
are not correlated with those coming out of Europe.
The argument is that, by including European futures investment in a US
portfolio, you can add further diversification to an existing portfolio, and
have a better chance of achieving the above-average performance expected of
the industry.
Evidence of this could be taken from the consistently strong performance
achievements of Hasenbichler, a firm of Austrian commodity-trading advisers
now based in Malta, which has appeared top of the Managed Account Report
performance tables for much of the past year.
The most important factor in this apparent wave of interest in Europe is
that it is coming at an institutional level. One of the first examples was
seen last year, when part of the money under management in the State of
Virginia's pension scheme was put into managed futures - and not just
managed futures run out of the US.
A UK-based futures manager, Sabre Fund Management, got some of that money to
manage. The blue-chip fund manager Henderson Administration bought 25 per
cent of Sabre last March as its first step into the managed futures
industry.
Mark Fox-Andrews, of Sabre, says: 'There is a lot happening at the moment,
because the message is getting across to the actuaries, trustees and clients
that derivatives and managed-futures programmes are available, cheap and
efficient. I hope that firms like us are going to be competing more with
other forms of investment activity.'
At the retail level, the regulatory restrictions on managed futures funds in
Europe are still draconian. Only four European countries have regulations
for such funds in place: the UK, France, Luxembourg and Ireland. Only France
and the UK have domestic, retail managed futures funds. France has 18 funds,
launched by the big French banks, which have headed into the industry with
enormous enthusiasm; while the UK has two types of fund, the futures and
options fund (Fof) and the geared futures and options fund (Gfof).
One of the first in the market in the UK, and still one of the principal
players, is John Govett, which has 12 Fofs and two cash funds that run
alongside.
The firm has raised Pounds 133m for its Fofs, mostly through the broker bond
route. Adam Parkin, director of John Govett and responsible for derivative
investment, is aware that they have led where others now plan to follow.
'There is no doubt that John Govett opened a door and raised the
consciousness of retail funds in the UK,' he says.
The next to step through that door is Fidelity, which has initially launched
four Fofs, the Stabiliser Growth Range of Controlled Risk funds. In their
turn, these funds are now part of Fidelity's Asset Manager money management
service, designed to provide a better long-term return than a building
society on the investor's savings.
To find futures and options funds for sale in the UK to the retail public is
staggering. To find them on sale as a better option than a building society
deposit is quite extraordinary.
'We have a real commitment to this market,' says Trevor Robinson, head of
derivatives, who reports that Fidelity plans further futures and options
products, possibly even a Gfof, which has as yet not been seen in the UK.
Less successful, but equally enthusiastic, was the launch of the US Masters
Guaranteed Futures Fund this year, by Johnson Fry Securities, better known
for its distribution of tax-shelter products in the UK. The US Masters fund
raised Pounds 4m, and Johnson Fry is coming back to the market with another
managed futures product in the spring.
Citibank Private Banking Group has raised the most money for a managed
futures fund in Europe, with its TradeWinds private offering in 1992, which
raised Dollars 135m. TradeWinds had a state-of-the-art guarantee, based on a
letter of credit, which limited the downside risk without tying up large
amounts of the investment capital. Market research showed that 95 per cent
of TradeWinds' investors went into the product because of this letter of
credit.
Citibank now plans a new fund, aimed at the retail market in Germany and
institutions in Switzerland, Holland and other European countries. It is
believed that the product will be denominated in Deutsche Marks and equally
revolutionary in structure.
The clearest sign that the Europeans are competing with the Americans is the
recent news that a UK information and research house specialising in the
managed futures industry, TASS Management, has been selected by the US
industry trade associations, the Managed Futures Association and the Futures
Industry Institute, to develop a definitive index for the managed futures
industry.
Nicola Meaden, managing director of TASS, says: 'Much of the traditional
fund management community now recognises the value of incorporating managed
futures into well diversified portfolios.'

FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (7): Salutary September - Risk
management / Few systems respond well when the markets do something
unexpected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS nothing like a good old-fashioned crisis in financial markets to
test just how good your damage-limitation policies really are. That's
exactly what the European currency markets got in September - and the
damage-limitation in many cases was inadequate.
'It focused the mind,' says Mr Gary Southern, head of capital markets at
National Westminster. 'It reinforced the old story - how good are your
systems, and how do you deal with a once-every-ten-years event?'
Risk-management systems, into which certain assumptions have been fed about
the way financial markets behave, do not respond well when the markets do
something altogether different. That explains the discomfort experienced by
many derivatives houses in September.
First, the volatility in currency and short-term interest rate markets shot
up. Most banks' risk-management models work on a 95 per cent confidence
level: that is, they are programmed to expect the sort of behaviour that is
usual most of the time. Anything outside that range - the
once-every-ten-years event - is not planned for.
The trouble is, when that event comes, the markets can move far from their
normal ranges - as happened in September, when interest rates in some
European currencies soared past 100 per cent. Any confidence level is likely
to prove an illusory comfort. As Ms Marion Robieson, head of product risk at
Bankers Trust, in New York, said shortly afterwards: 'In practice, you
almost never reach this level - except when you grossly exceed it.'
Second, liquidity disappeared in many markets as the crisis broke. That
meant that any institution that was hedging dynamically - that is, adjusting
its cover minute-by-minute to reflect market movements - could no longer
find anyone to deal with. The only alternative: sit tight and wait for
normality to return, by which time the institution could be sitting either
on a big profit or a big loss.
The lessons of September should have filtered through to most senior bankers
by now. They have certainly not been wasted on banking regulators. Speaking
at a conference at the end of November, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general
manager of the Bank for International Settlements, criticised derivatives
specialists for not making clear the real risks they were running on behalf
of their banks:
'They fail to make explicit to their senior management (and on occasion even
themselves) that the pricing and hedging models are based on historical
volatility experiences which are not necessarily safe guides for the
future.'
He added: 'I have the impression that some of the volatilities experienced a
couple of months ago were of a scale which were not incorporated in the
models, and may have therefore led to an unexpected erosion of liquidity in
some of the markets'
While recent events in the markets have given the risk managers something to
think about, trying to assess the risks in new financial instruments remains
among their biggest concerns. Breaking a new financial product down into its
component parts and hedging each bit each separately (interest rate risk
here, currency exposure there and volatility somewhere else) does not always
work.
'The problem with new products is that they sometimes involve risks that are
not traded in the market,' says Mr Brian Crowe, in charge of risk management
for Chase Manhattan's fixed income and treasury operations in London.
An example is the 'diff swap", which allows an institution to swap the
cashflows on an asset or liability in one currency for those in another
currency. Such agreements became common with the sharp divergence of US and
European interest rates, which has only recently begun to be reversed. Diff
swaps involve what is known as 'correlation risk': an assumption that there
will be there will be a correlation between an interest rate movement and
that of the currency. Such tidy relationships do not always work in
practice.
Correlation risk cannot be traded or hedged directly, leaving banks
potentially exposed. Judging by the rumours in financial circles about the
losses on diff swaps, some banks have already learnt these risks to their
cost.
Understanding the risks inherent in new financial instruments may be
exercising the minds of many bankers at the moment, but this is by no means
the direction from which the biggest losses could come. 'One ignores
operational risk, legal risk and tax risk at one's peril,' says Mr Barry
Hamilton, head of risk management in the treasury division of Barclays Bank.
Certainly, it is from these areas that some of the biggest publicised losses
in derivatives markets have come.
Banks which entered swap agreements with British local authorities, for
instance, discovered to their cost that the authorities had no legal power
to enter such agreements - but only after several years of doing business
and a judgment from the House of Lords.
And Westpac, the Australian banking group, demonstrated the pitfalls that
can lie in international hedging operations a month ago when it was forced
to pay an unexpected tax liability and penalties of nearly Dollars 80m in
the US. The bill, which forced the group to halve its dividend unexpectedly,
arose from what Westpac said was the conflicting tax treatment in the US and
Australia of swaps and forward contracts.
The ability of settlement systems around the world to cope with large
volumes of transactions - and concern about what would happen if a system
collapsed - also appears high on the worry list of many risks management
executives. As Mr Philip Guy, head of treasury at Hill Samuel, says: 'It's
the bits at the edges that are going to catch us out. You can know about the
risks, but it's difficult to set up controls to protect yourself against
them.'

FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (8): Regulators want answers -
Technology, lack of integration hampers many firms / Unmatched systems at
product and departmental level can be a nightmare for managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TALK ABOUT technology with anyone in the derivatives business, and it will
not be long before the word 'integration' comes up. Integration can mean one
of two things.
At the broadest level, it means bringing together the computer hardware,
database tools and software used in the front and back offices, to create a
seamless operational web that allows managers effectively to monitor and
control their derivatives operations.
In a narrower sense, integration can also mean employing a single software
package which can handle the entire range of derivative instruments,
including swaps, forward rate agreements, options and all the many
variations.
Both forms of integration are ideals to which firms aspire. The reality,
however, is often something different.
Some players in the derivatives market use one system for swaps, another
system for options, a third for caps, and so on. Similarly, the absence of
integration between front and back offices means that firms use ill-matched
systems that are both old and new, home-made and externally-developed, and
above all, technologically incompatible. The resulting lack of integration
at a product and departmental level can be a nightmare for derivatives
managers. More worrying, it raises important questions about a firm's
ability to monitor and control what is a complex and risky business.
These are questions that regulators, especially in the US, want answered. Mr
Chester Feldberg, executive vice-president of the New York Federal Reserve,
raised the issue of poor management in the derivatives business, last March,
in a letter to banks operating under its jurisdiction.
Mr Feldberg said the Fed had become aware of some 'basic internal control
weaknesses' within the banks' trading operations, including inadequate
accounting and control procedures in the trading of options, foreign
exchange and interest rate derivative products. He went on to ask banks to
review their risk-management controls and systems, and to take remedial
action where necessary to bring them up to standard.
What so alarms the Fed is the possibility that banks may lack the
technological tools and organisational structures to measure and control
adequately the financial risks on their diversified derivatives books. In
particular, the authorities fear that some banks - especially the small and
mid-sized operators who have rushed into the derivatives business in search
of quick, big profits - do not really know the full extent of their
exposures.
These fears are sometimes stoked by the third-party technology providers -
the software companies that specialise in providing banks and securities
houses with derivatives management systems.
While most players in the market tend to cherry-pick the best software the
vendors have to offer - relying on a lot of their own, in-house developed
technology to complete the structure - the software companies are
understandably keen on preaching the gospel of integration.
Mr Rod Beckstrom, a former Morgan Stanley trader who founded C ATS Software,
one of the main providers of software to the industry, says integration is
sorely lacking in many banks' derivatives operations.
'Many firms still can't mark their entire portfolios to market on a dynamic
intraday basis, because their systems lack adequate speed,' Mr Beckstrom
told a swaps dealers conference earlier this year. 'Some organisations can't
update their accounting books on a daily basis. Some miss payments and must
suffer huge penalties. Some firms can administer a swap through its life for
about Dollars 2,500, while others spend about Dollars 35,000.'
Mr Beckstrom argues that the central problem is the discrepancy that exists
between what banks want to do in the way of risk management, and what their
existing, non-integrated technology enables them to do.
This lack of integration is not just a consequence of using ill-fitting
systems - differences between front- and back-office management can create
political hurdles that are difficult to overcome. As one derivatives banker
puts it: 'In organisations, people have separate sets of objectives, and in
many cases heads just clash over this sort of thing.'
One way to avoid the departmental rivalries that impede systems integration
is to make one senior executive responsible for both the front and back
offices. It also helps if the back-office staff are not kept in the dark
about what the 'rocket scientists' who design the products and the dealers
who trade them are up to.
Chemical Bank, in New York, is one place where the distinctions between
front and back office have been blurred by integration. Mr Jeffrey Larsen,
head of the bank's global derivatives operations, says his back-office staff
are extremely sophisticated, and understand what is happening at the sharp
end of the business. This sharing of knowledge has created a 'middle office'
occupied by systems and operational staff who bridge the gap between the
front and back offices.
Chemical is one of the few in the derivatives business to rely almost
entirely on its technology. Apart from a few remnants of outside software
from its early days in the business, everything is designed and built
internally. This is because the bank has discovered that mixing internally
and externally developed systems is a complicated and not always effective
process. Integration is also much easier if everything is done in-house.
Mr Larsen admits that the new 'open' systems - which allow banks to take
different groups of business computers and integrate them so they work as a
whole - are more conducive to mixing. For the sake of cost and consistency,
however, Chemical is sticking with its in-house technology, although it is
updating its hardware from IBM-compatible PCs (the technology which most
players in the business still rely on) to Unix workstations, 'so that we can
hook everything together.'
The ability to run greater numbers of different applications simultaneously
is why more and more firms are moving up to workstations. Although the
latest high-end PCs compare favourably with Unix workstations in certain
respects, the Microsoft operating systems remains relatively basic when
measured against the Unix, which also has superior networking capabilities -
an important point for banks and securities houses with big trading floors.
Most players in the derivatives business use a combination of their own and
vendor-supplied technology. The main software providers - Devon Systems is
the market leader, and others include C ATS Software, Quotient, and
Renaissance Software - also sell a package that serves both front- and
back-office needs.
Their software fulfils a number of key functions. In the front office, it is
used for transaction structuring and pricing, and for portfolio risk
management that enables users to hedge the different components of risk.
In the back office, software systems handle payments and settlement
processing, and also execute accounting and reporting functions. At its
best, the outside vendor should offer the user a package that covers all
markets and all instruments, and is fully integrated, enabling front and
back offices to work smoothly together.
Some of the most sophisticated players do not just use their own technology
alongside that provided by vendors; they also take third-party software, and
program it to support their own models - and the providers design their
products so users can do just that.
Vendor-supplied software is probably most effectively employed in the
pricing of traders' derivatives books. Because no central exchange exists
where dealers can find prices for over-the-counter derivatives, firms have a
choice. They either build their own valuation models, or they can turn to an
outside vendor, whose technology has been proven in the marketplace.
Many choose the latter course, primarily because harnessing software that is
widely used in the business gives them the confidence that the models and
formulas they employ to value their proprietary trading portfolios are not
out of kilter with the rest of the market's.
Those banks that rely on in-house developed systems to value books are
taking a risk. No one else is using their system, so it is difficult to
determine whether they are correctly valuing their derivatives books. In a
highly competitive business that thrives on innovation, keeping up with the
latest derivatives technology can be expensive.
Although it varies greatly, according to the size of each operation,
industry observers estimate that a reasonably-sized player in the market can
spend anything between Dollars 100,000 and several million dollars a year on
vendor-supplied software alone.
When the cost of the hardware, or of developing in-house systems, is added,
the figures reach tens of millions of dollars. And firms never stop spending
on technology. As Mr Patrick Brazel, of Devon Systems explains: 'You pay all
the time, because of the rate of change of functional changes in the
systems.'

FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (5): New law lifts uncertainty - The
exchanges' response to the OTC challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<TEXT>
THE WORLD's futures and options exchanges are, to some degree, the victims
of their own success. Their pioneering work in developing futures contracts
on foreign currencies, debt, and equities converted a whole population of
staid bankers and corporate money managers into hi-technology financial
strategists.
They created a financial industry called risk management, and in the process
awakened Wall Street giants who have learned their game and are taking it
beyond the bounds of exchange trading floors.
Before the advent of derivatives, the financial world was simple. A
fraternity of investment bankers catered to the vast financial needs of the
world's governments, municipalities and corporations. They made their bets
and took their lumps or rewards in private. Off to one side were the stock
and commodity exchanges, where small investors, protected by financial
guarantees and government-supervised rules, met the world's monetary giants.
Those lines blurred in 1973, when Chicago's commodity exchanges adapted
their futures contracts to the world of finance. Backed by financial
physicists from the University of Chicago, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME), then best known for its pork-belly pit, invented currency futures.
That same year, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) took a look at the stock
market, listened the pricing theories of a couple of bright academics named
Fisher Black and Myron Scholes, and created stock options.
The creations transformed finance. Exchange volumes rocketed as futures and
options appeared for every imaginable debt and equity instrument, and for
new commodities like oil. The traders and the trades became increasingly
sophisticated, as did the technology that aided them. Exchanges grew rich
and dependent on spectacular annual growth rates.
The exchange bonanza slowed in the US after 1987, about the same time a few
of Wall Street's biggest investment banks started to apply exchange-style
risk-management strategies to private transactions with their customers.
The change in tide was predictable, given the constraints of the exchange
instruments. Exchange-traded futures and options have standardised contract
sizes, delivery dates, and specifications for the underlying securities.
Corporate clients wanted tailor-made hedges for their portfolios.
The resulting over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market exploded with even
more force than financial futures, and now dwarfs exchange volume. Wall
Street bankers say both markets benefited from the global expansion of
financial markets in the 1980s, and that on-exchange and off-exchange
products are compatible and not competitive.
That sanguine view was not shared by the futures industry. Executives at the
CBOT and the CME, stung by the challenge to their franchise, led a charge to
have swaps, the over-the-counter instruments most often used to hedge
currency and interest rate risk, classified as futures. US commodities law
requires all futures to be exchange-traded.
The exchanges were furious that their own regulatory constraints limited
their flexibility to compete with the new OTC instruments.
The battle was a delicate one. The exchanges were attacking top-tier
investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and Solomon Brothers, that were
their biggest customers and often exchange members. If they won, the
exchanges would retain their monopoly, but would have caused the collapse of
a multi-trillion-dollar industry.
In the end, Wall Street persuaded the exchanges that they shared important
interests. After years of wrangling, the two groups teamed up this year to
support legislation that exempted swaps from futures regulation, while
accomplishing the long-delayed reauthorisation of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC).
The law, which was passed in October, relieves the swaps markets of
regulatory uncertainty, and, in a twist, may let futures exchanges offer
swap-like products without CFTC oversight.
In the meantime, US futures and options exchanges have had time to measure
the effect that OTC derivatives have had on their business. Some, like the
New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and the CME, have found that
counterparties in energy and interest-rate swaps eventually come to the
exchanges to lay off their risk.
To the extent that swaps dealers educate potential customers and place a
share of their trades in the futures pits, they are welcome business
partners. 'We view the swaps markets as the commuter train that brings
customers to CME's station,' says Jack Sandner, Chairman of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
In a bow to that business, most exchanges have modified their products to
accommodate OTC traders. The Nymex in 1990 extended the delivery months for
its crude oil futures out to 36 months, from its initial 18 months. Almost
all the action in those new contracts are from swap traders. Like nearly
every other US futures and options exchange, Nymex has also modified its
rules so that institutional traders who demonstrate that they have swap
market risk can take big positions with reduced margins.
To accommodate a Dollars 3,000bn interest-rate swap market, the CME has
long-dated the delivery months in its highly successful Eurodollar futures
market out to five years. The Euro contract and interest-rate swaps have
grown in tandem, with Eurodollar futures and options positions valued at
about Dollars 2,750bn at the end of 1991.
The CME's foreign currency futures haven't fared as well. Volume and market
share is dropping as the OTC market expands. The CME failed in an attempt to
launch a future to mimic the highly successful OTC currency swaps market.
While they don't yet tailor-make derivatives, exchanges can do a few things
OTC markets cannot. Exchange clearing-houses guarantee all trades, and take
the opposite side to every futures and options transaction. This eliminates
the credit risk and counterparty risk present in OTC trades.
Price discovery is easier than in the OTC markets, because futures and
options trades are reported immediately, and the prices are widely
distributed. Since there are many traders in each futures pit,
exchange-traded derivatives are also more liquid that bilateral OTC trades.
Mr William Floersch, vice chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
believes that exchanges can compete with OTC derivatives. Noting that only
the biggest investment houses have the capital assume the risk of OTC
trades, Mr. Floersch says: 'There are enormous amounts of people with lots
of capital who don't have access to the OTC market. We are interested in
getting small and medium sized dealers into the (derivatives) business.'
The CBOE may be the first exchange to construct a product that its customers
can adjust to own their needs. It plans to begin trading 'flex options'
during the first quarter of 1993. The product is aimed at institutional OTC
customers, and will allow them to select any strike price and expiration out
to five years.
The flex options will initially apply to the CBOE's Standard and Poor's 100
and 500 stock index baskets. The trades will have Dollars 10m underlying
value, much larger that its standard index options contracts.
The CBOE has selected the most commoditised area of equity swaps, 'plain
vanilla' in industry parlance, to attempt flex. Wall Street investment
bankers grudgingly concede that flex options may fly. Corporate treasurers
who have become accustomed to using swaps may be weaned from the OTC market
with the credit guarantees of the CBOE's clearing-house and by its more
competitive method of pricing.
The CBOE and its New York rival, the American Stock Exchange, are also
planning stock index options with quarterly expirations to accomodate fund
managers whose performance, already linked to a stock index, is judged on a
quarterly or year-end basis. The CBOE's index options typically expire at
mid-month.
If the CBOE is preparing a run on the OTC equity market, the tiny
Philadelphia Stock Exchange is not ready to surrender the currency
derivatives business to off-exchange trading. Like the CME, the Philex's
attempt at currency cross rate options trading failed.
However, the exchange, which has the largest exchange-traded currency
options business in the US, is also planning month-end expirations, and some
very short-dated products, with lifetimes of a week or two. 'We found we got
the most activity in our products during the last weeks of their life,' said
Joseph Rizzello, Philex's senior vice-president for marketing.
Mr Rizzello believes that the Philex can tweak its standardised products
enough to make them appeal to corporate customers. He also thinks foreign
exchange trading can only expand globally, and he wants the Philex to have a
piece of the action. Exchange-traded currency options are now a Dollars 6bn
a day business, while their OTC counterparts are valued at Dollars 30bn.
Of the nation's biggest exchanges, only the CBOT is uncomfortable about
compromising with the OTC market. OTC derivatives bring some business into
the exchange's 5- and 10-year Treasury note futures pits, but not enough to
satisfy exchange officials.
They believe the new Commodity Futures Trading Practices law gives exchanges
equal rights to trade swaps free of regulation, and they plan a fiesty
demonstration of their new freedoms. CBOT Chairman William O'Connor said the
exchange was prepared to trade swaps on its electronic bulletin board as
soon as practicable. A tiff between the CFTC and the CBOT over the
interpretation of the law may delay that venture.
