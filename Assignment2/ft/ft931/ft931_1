FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airtours deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large share trading loss was taken yesterday by Airtours, the UK's third
biggest tour group, as it sold its 8.2 per cent stake in Owners Abroad.
Airtours built up the holding over the past month during its Pounds 290m
hostile bid for its larger rival, a move which ended in defeat two weeks
ago. Airtours is thought to have paid between 144p and 150p a share for the
12.7m stake. Yesterday, the Seaq ticker showed 20m shares going through the
market at around 117p, indicating a substantial loss to Airtours and
suggesting some of the stake may still be waiting to be placed.
Smith New Court was said to have bought the shares and placed them with
institutions. No one was available for comment at either the securities
house or Airtours. Airtours firmed a penny to 305p, with Owners steady at
124p.
News that advance holiday sales are up at Rank Organisation lifted the
shares, although analysts pointed out that the rise still did not compensate
the decline suffered last year. The shares rose 14 to 663p.
Whisky stocks largely survived appalling export figures and poor results
from two of the smaller companies. The export figures showed a 34 per cent
fall in value terms during January and February. Burn Stewart was not immune
from its disappointing figures, the shares coming off 7 to 128p. But
Guinness, helped again by a NatWest Securities note, gained 3 to 486p.
ICI fell 15 to 1169p after news that it will demerge on June 1 drew
attention to its Pounds 1.3bn cash call. The lack of evidence of chemicals
picking up in Europe, and drug stocks remaining under pressure, also
contributed towards the weakness. News of a co-promotional agreement with
Amersham International helped neither company and Amersham fell 12 to 726p.
Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett said: 'The market has reacted
ungratefully to unexpected good news which makes enormous strategic sense
for Amersham.' But the company had not suffered with the rest of the sector
and profit-takers were responsible for bringing the price down.
Elsewhere, the sector was slightly more buoyant, res-ponding to a better
performance in New York on Monday night. Glaxo rose 12 to 588p, and
SmithKline Beecham was firm ahead of a meeting at the group's key
Philadelphia plant last night. The meeting is expected to contain
encouraging reports on research and development and the 'A' shares improved
4 1/2 to 397p and the Units 4 to 348p. Wellcome continued to languish,
ending 3 lower at 739p.
The two banks with the heaviest exposure to Hong Kong, HSBC and Standard
Chartered, were strongly supported as the market reacted to the recent
easing of tension between the Chinese and UK governments.
HSBC moved forward 12 to 616p and Standard Chartered, the bank now most
heavily geared to Hong Kong since HSBC's absorption of Midland, appreciated
7 to 708p.
Insurance shares were largely unaffected by news that the recent blizzards
which hit the east coast of the United States had resulted in damage claims
of Dollars 1.625bn (Pounds 1.14bn), according to the highly respected
American Insurance Group. Motors and business services group Inchcape fell
12 to 585p after announcing a Pounds 125m convertible bond issue. Investors
sold stock to take up the issue.
Taylor Woodrow moved up 4 to 88p, with the market relieved about the level
of provisions and happy to focus on the group's recovery prospects.
Chemicals group Croda International climbed 17 to 258p after announcing a
profits surge to Pounds 29.8m from a previous Pounds 21.3m and delivering an
optimistic statement. Jeyes Group, the manufacturer of cleaning products,
rose 8 to 414p after revealing a 31 per cent jump in profits for 1992.
Food retailing issues came under pressure as Smith New Court became the
latest house to turn negative.
Smith moved to a short-term underweight stance. Among the leading stocks,
Argyll Group declined 7 to 338p, Iceland Frozen Foods 10 to 722p and Kwik
Save 15 to 771p.
Hillsdown was said to have benefited from a positive note from SG Warburg
following a presentation. Two agency crosses at 185p pulled Sims Food back
to close 3 off at 189p.
News and financial information group Reuters shed 27 to 1328p as a block of
shares was sold in a thin market.
Trading in Thames Television was suspended at 221p after a report of talks
between its parent, Thorn EMI, and media conglomerate Pearson. Pearson,
which later confirmed that it was in talks, added 6 at 410p. Thorn eased 2
to 888p.
Reports that a consortium led by Carlton Communications will make a smaller
equity injection than previously thought for its takeover of Independent
Television News today helped Carlton shares rise 9 to 763p.
Shares in construction equipment company BM Group continued to slide and
closed 6 weaker at 36p, on fears that the company is to issue a profits
warning on its full-year results when it reports interim figures today.
News that China is to buy 12 Airbus aircraft, with a possibility of a
further nine lifted British Aerospace shares 8 to 273p. BAe has a 20 per
cent stake in the Airbus consortium and builds the wings on the airbus
aircraft. Rolls-Royce improved 3 to 124p.
Smiths Industries shed a penny to 323p, with a stock overhang continuing to
depress the shares. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to be leading the day's
selling, although several other brokers were also reported to be carrying
large lines of stock. Weir Group relinquished 16 to 599p, with brokers
remaining cautious about the company's first-half trading performance.
Turnover in FKI rose to 9.4m after a cross of 4m. The shares closed
unchanged at 120p.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Taylor Woodrow goes deeper into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES on several problem contracts and further write-downs in property and
land values sent Taylor Woodrow, the UK construction group, much deeper into
the red last year.
The final dividend was slashed to 0.5p to leave a 1p total, down from 9.5p.
Pre-tax losses of Pounds 66.1m, against Pounds 2.7m, followed Pounds 66.4m
of exceptional charges as housing land and property values were cut further.
Before exceptionals, profits fell from Pounds 43.8m to Pounds 300,000.
Contracting, which accounted for 71 per cent of the group's Pounds 1.23bn
sales, increased its losses from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 32.5m. Problem
contracts include: the Channel tunnel, for which Pounds 8.5m was provided;
the Storebaelt project in Denmark; Euro Disney in Paris; John Wayne airport
in the US; and a newly disclosed Pounds 4.2m shortfall in Saudi Arabia. Mr
Tony Palmer, chief executive, said: 'It is an unhappy coincidence that we
have so many unresolved issues at the same time.'
Action taken to cut Pounds 20m from annual overhead costs included shedding
1,400 jobs - among them 30 subsidiary directors as 30 companies were
eliminated. Sixteen buildings had been vacated, releasing 150,000 sq ft for
sale, rent or surrender.
Property contributed Pounds 17.2m to profits, down from Pounds 44m.
Disposals amounted to Pounds 32m, rental income increased. The portfolio
value has declined from Pounds 802m at the end of 1989 to Pounds 548m.
In housing, profits were flat at Pounds 6.6m as UK losses offset
improvements in North America and Australia. The write-downs reduced the
average land value per plot to Pounds 10,500, about 14 per cent of the
selling price.
The trading and financial division declined from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 9m.
Mr David Green, finance director, said net debt had gone up from Pounds 156m
to Pounds 228.6m. The cash outflow was Pounds 62m, most of it in contracting
which had now stabilised. More disposals were expected.
Net assets fell from Pounds 677m to Pounds 525m after a Pounds 23.8m
extraordinary charge for closing a structural steel business and a Pounds
58m cut in revaluation reserves.
Gearing had nearly doubled to 43.5 per cent. The target was to reduce it to
less than 40 per cent this year.
Losses per share grew to 93.8p from 68.6p.

FT  31 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Taylor Woodrow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years after it tapped shareholders for Pounds 162m to fund expansion,
Taylor Woodrow can afford to pay no more than a token 1p dividend. Land and
property write-downs and losses on troublesome contracts have whittled away
its balance sheet. Despite the rights issue, the company has lost almost 40
per cent of its shareholders' funds since 1989.
Continuing problems at its Channel tunnel, Euro Disney and Storebaelt
projects were largely responsible for a Pounds 32.5m loss in its contracting
division. The revelation of a Pounds 4.2m provision on a Saudi Arabian
contract came as a further nasty shock. Shareholders might reasonably demand
retribution for such poor performance. But the triumvirate thrown up by
Taylor Woodrow's reshuffle, all of whom were on the board at the time of the
rights issue, seems intent on completing the job itself. The board has been
cut from 18 to seven. Thirty directors of subsidiary companies have also
departed. Overhead costs have been hacked back and its loss-making steel
fabricator closed. It is a pity such action was not taken at the start of
recession.
Taylor Woodrow retains some attractive property assets. But there are enough
high-yielding property companies around for investors who want direct
exposure to the sector. The chill recessionary winds have left Taylor
Woodrow with severe financial hypothermia. Cash is still being withdrawn
from the extremities to preserve heat at the core. It will be a while before
the company warms up sufficiently to regain much movement.

<TEXT>
The day's two newcomers to the stock market, Hambros Insurance Services
Group and Quality Software Products, put on very creditable first-day
showings.
The former was the market's third most heavily traded stock with some 15m
shares changing hands. The shares, oversubscribed almost four times, opened
at 146p, an 8p premium to the offer price of 138p, and moved in a relatively
narrow range to close at 144p. The shares attracted applications from 93
independent intermediaries - stockbrokers or financial advisers - more than
double the previous record for any flotation.
Quality Software quickly surged ahead to reach 537p, the eventual closing
level, for a premium of 41 per cent on the 380p issue price. Turnover was
1.3m shares.

SHARES IN Quality Software Products, the accounting software company which
came to market last week, moved ahead strongly on the first day of trading,
closing 155p up at 535p.
Some 2.85m shares had been placed at 380p valuing the company at Pounds
29.6m. About 1.3m shares traded yesterday.
The rise raised questions about whether the offer price had been set too
low. Analysts said, however, that in the wake of offerings like Tadpole
Technology which came to market at 65p and was now trading at 304p there was
considerable interest in small, high technology stocks.
The difficulty for market makers Hoare Govett, in managing the placement,
had been to strike a balance between the company's potential and the fact
that the success of its main new product, Universal Olas, was by no means a
certainty.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Syncordia finds connections slow
to make - British Telecom's network management unit is optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYNCORDIA, British Telecom's Atlanta-based network management subsidiary,
was launched 18 months ago with much fanfare and big ambitions. But it has
been slow off the mark.
The offshoot, centred on global telecommunications outsourcing - whereby
companies spin off their computer systems management to an outside
specialist - has announced only four customers so far.
They are Amadeus, the European travel reservations consortium, BP Chemicals,
IBM-Europe and Firmenich, the Swiss maker of fragrances and flavourings.
However, Mr John Koehler, the company vice-president and general manager,
says it has more than double that many letters of intent.
But if Mr Koehler does not sign at least four of those by today he will not
meet his publicly-stated goal of at least eight customers by the end of this
month, the end of Syncordia's first full fiscal year.
Nonetheless, he said, 'I'm happy with where we are. We're getting all the
business we hoped to get and more.' BT, he added, is 'very pleased'.
The company contends that because of a sales cycle of up to two years it is
just on the cusp of reaping what it has sown since September 1991. One of
the deals soon to be announced will be Readers Digest, whose contract for
data transmission services is in the final testing phase.
Syncordia says a lengthy sales pitch is required to overcome the many
reservations companies have about farming out such a vital and sensitive
part of their business. It takes time, says Mr Koehler, for 'people to
understand how they fit together. You're really becoming part of their
company.'
Yet, even the upbeat Mr Koehler is unsure when Syncordia will operate in the
black. He warily suggested it would not be impossible in two more years.
At present, he calculates the annual revenues from Syncordia's four
contracts at Dollars 32m to Dollars 40m. BT will not say how much it has
invested, although analysts estimate the amount at roughly a couple of
hundred million dollars. Despite the cost, BT's commitment to making
Syncordia a leading player in what is estimated to become a Dollars 4bn to
Dollars 6bn network outsourcing market by the mid-1990s is unflagging. Mr
Bob Raggett, a BT spokesman, said: 'We are looking for quite considerable
growth internationally, and Syncordia has to be a success. It's what the
customers are asking for.'
BT has, however, had to go it alone on Syncordia without the equity
partnerships it originally envisaged.
BT failed to entice Deutsche Telekom or Japan's NTT to join as 26 per cent
equity partners in Syncordia. BT instead joined France Telecom to form their
own outsourcing company, called Eunetcom. NTT, with a restructuring under
way, has put talks with BT on ice.
In the crucial and highly-competitive US market, a partnership or an
alliance is deemed especially important for Syncordia's success. Mr Eugene
Idenberg, executive vice-president of MCI Communications, said Syncordia
'will have a tough time without an American partner'.
This notion has helped fuel rumours of BT's interest in buying a stake in
EDS, the Dallas-based data processing company. But BT's Mr Raggett says
'We've been waltzing around the dance floor with practically everyone' in an
attempt to find a US partner or acquisition. He added the effort was not
just for Syncordia but for BT.
Syncordia has so far created just 25 of its eventual target of 70 switching
hubs in major cities, which means some customers might have to wait.
Meanwhile, its staff has grown from just under 70 to 230 in Atlanta and a
total of 350 worldwide.
Outsourcing can include designing a voice, data and video communications
system, purchasing and installing equipment around the world, providing and
monitoring the global network and unified billing across currencies. But, so
far, Syncordia's contracts tend to be for a slice of these services.
For Amadeus, which was expanding into North America, Syncordia is providing
a network for data transmission between the travel company's main data
processing centre in Erding, Germany, and US locations through Atlanta.
Given that Amadeus does not have personnel in North America, Syncordia
provides staff, evaluates vendors, and selects and buys hardware and
presents integrated billing.
For IBM Europe, on the other hand, its contract is more limited. It manages
only the physical private network linking 10 IBM locations in five European
countries to its international backbone network.
Yet if Syncordia's has not made the biggest splash into this relatively
fresh market, BT seems undeterred.
Mr Laurence Heyworth, an analyst with Robert Fleming Securities, says, given
Syncordia's importance in BT's strategy to be the leading supplier of
telecommunications services worldwide, 'as long as they feel that it's
moving in the right direction, they'll back it to the hilt.'

ALCATEL SESA, the Spanish arm of the French telecommunications group, has
agreed to pay Dollars 37.3m for Poland's PZT Telekom factory in Warsaw and
the Teletra plant in Poznan.
Alcatel will also invest Dollars 60m in the plants. The purchase opens the
way into Poland's domestic market for Alcatel as government regulations say
suppliers of telecommunications equipment have to produce at least half of
the value of any contracts.
The number of foreign bidders for contracts to supply telecommunications
equipment has been limited to three and each will have to have purchased
Polish plants. Next week the government is to chose between two rival bids
from Siemens and Northern Telecom for two further electronics plants, Elwro
in Wroclaw and Zwut in Warsaw.
This decision will in effect determine the identity of Poland's suppliers in
this sector for the foreseeable future as AT&amp;T has already bought the Telfa
plant in Bydgoszcz.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Cariplo reports profits flat at L298bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARIPLO, Italy's biggest savings bank, which is in talks to buy a large
stake in the state-owned Istituto Mobiliare Italiano financial services
group, reported virtually static net profits of L298bn (Dollars 185.3m) last
year against L296bn in 1991.
Operating earnings rose by 5.9 per cent to L1,746bn; provisions,
depreciation, write-offs and tax amounted to L1,373bn, while L75bn was
transferred to shareholders' reserves.
Deposits rose by 10.7 per cent to L98,208bn, while total loans jumped by
14.7 per cent to L101,546bn. The bank's total assets jumped by 16.2 per cent
to L132,659bn.
In Rome yesterday, a further round was held in the continuing negotiations
to sell a 44 per cent stake in IMI owned by the treasury to a Cariplo-led
group of big Italian savings banks. The talks, which have been continuing in
various forms for over two years, have recently gained new life after
appearing to collapse earlier this year.
Sogefi, the listed car components company controlled by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti's listed CIR holding company, more than doubled group net profits
to L33.3bn, from L15.3bn in 1991.
Sales rose by 6.7 per cent to L664.5bn, in spite of the downturn in the
European motor industry and growing pressure on component suppliers from
leading car groups. The company, 60 per cent owned by CIR, is raising the
dividend by L20 to L120 a share.
Earnings were also boosted by last year's sale of Sogefi's 48 per cent stake
in the German Boge group to Mannesmann. The L120bn transaction produced a
L19bn extraordinary gain and helped cut group borrowings to L116.4bn from
L251.7bn at the end of 1991. Borrowings could fall further this year
following this month's L28bn sale of the group's SVAMA distribution
subsidiary.

Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, reported that profits for the
first six months of its 1992-93 financial year prior to tax, write-offs and
provisions rose slightly to L350.7bn from L340.4bn at the same time last
year.
Italian banks have recently reported heavy write-offs on securities holdings
and additional loan-loss provisions owing to the recession, implying that
the trend in Mediobanca's earnings may not be maintained when full-year
figures are reported in September.

share capital by FM300m (Dollars 50.8m) from the current FM798.6m, the
company said in a statement, Reuter reports from Helsinki.
The rise could take place through one or more rights issues, or through
issuing convertible bonds or bonds with warrants. The funds would be used to
finance acquisitions, to enable the company to participate in joint ventures

<TEXT>
THE GREEK government survived a censure motion in parliament yesterday on
the issue of recognising Macedonia, but Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, prime
minister, has not yet managed to quash objections by hardliners in his New
Democracy party, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The 152-145 vote clears the
way for the government to give a positive response to a UN Security Council
resolution that calls for admitting Macedonia to the UN under a temporary
name, pending international arbitration between Athens and Skopje on a
permanent one.
However, dissension remains in the party ranks underlined by the decision of
Mr George Rallis, a former prime minster, to resign his parliamentary seat
in protest at the government's handling of the question. The government also
appears to have last-minute worries that if it accepts the UN resolution,
the Macedonian flag, carrying an ancient Greek emblem, will be immediately
raised outside the UN building in New York. Changes to the flag is an issue
to be decided by UN arbitration.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Irish business and politics under spotlight: Tim Coone on
continuing hearings on corruption allegations in beef industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE a week at the Maynooth livestock market, just west of Dublin, thousands
of grass-fattened cattle are sold under the auctioneer's hammer to a mixed
audience of gruff, ruddy-faced farmers, slaughterhouse agents and overseas
buyers. The nod of a head here may be reflected in the price of a pack of
vacuum-packed mince in London or Paris.
For the past 35 years, it has been one of Ireland's main livestock markets.
It is a price-setting market for the industry: an industry which sustains
100,000 farmers, accounts for around 8 per cent of Irish exports and which
has become the subject of one of the longest running public inquiries in the
history of the Irish state.
For the past 18 months, in the sombre buildings of Dublin Castle, the
Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry, has been investigating
allegations made by opposition parliamentarians of fraud, malpractice and
political connivance in the Irish beef industry. Legal teams have been
ruminating over a paper trail of government documents, memos, ministers'
diary entries, heard over a thousand hours of sworn evidence from witnesses
which have included slaughterhousemen up to the prime minister himself, and
produced enough documentation to fill several cattle trucks.
The central character in this legal epic is Mr Larry Goodman, whose company
Goodman International, is Europe's biggest meat processor, and which has
been accused of breaching export regulations, abusing government export
credit insurance, and of using political influence to cut competitors out of
the market and to steer government policy in its favour.
In the past week, managers from his slaughterhouses have been giving
evidence denying that any deliberate breaches of regulations took place,
contradicting earlier evidence given by witnesses that some breaches
discovered at the plants may have been planned.
Mr Goodman himself sat in the witness box for a week earlier this month,
attired in a neat, dark-blue suit, with a red silk handkerchief tucked into
his top pocket. He spoke mildly but made no apologies for being a tough
businessmen.
'We lobbied for as much as we could as often as we could. . . I did have
access (to senior politicians) and I did use (that access) whenever I could
to the benefit of the company. . . On every occasion that I met with a
minister, yes, I would have used that to put our case,' were some of the
statements he made. But he emphatically denied that there was ever any
impropriety in any of these dealings.
Mr Goodman left school at 16 to help in his father's cattle trade business,
and over the next 37 years transformed Ireland's meat processing industry
into one of the most efficient in Europe and the largest supplier to the UK
supermarket chains in what is one of the most competitive and lowest-margin
industries.
Few people feel ambivalent about Ireland's so-called 'beef baron'. His
detractors see him as a secretive and unscrupulous entrepreneur, who has
built up an unhealthy level of market power, which they claim he has used to
bully and bend governments to his will. His perceived close relationships
with former prime minister, Mr Charles Haughey, and the present prime
minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, were seen by opponents as legitimate targets
of attack.
In his evidence Mr Goodman said that the 'genesis' of his problems began in
1987 'in stepping on to the stand with Mr Haughey and doing what I was asked
to do' in announcing a new IPounds 260m (Pounds 261m) beef industry
development plan.
His admirers view him as someone who has directly or indirectly created tens
of thousands of jobs in Ireland, who paid farmers promptly and fairly and
paid his workforce well.
'The farmers would have little bad to say about Larry,' said Mr Sean Doyle,
who helps run the family company that owns the Maynooth livestock market.
'He put money into the farmers' pockets and found export markets where
nobody else did. At times he was in there buying everything.'
No rural politician or party leader in Ireland can afford to ignore the
voice of their constituencies. The question being asked though by Mr Justice
Liam Hamilton, the chairman of the tribunal, is whether those politicians
have also ignored the ethical standards expected of elected public
representatives.
A number of allegations against Mr Goodman have already been withdrawn, in
the absence of evidence to substantiate them. Mr Dermot Gleeson, the counsel
for Goodman International, has pointed out that political contributions by
the company to all political parties amounted to no more than 0.06 per cent
of the company's turnover over the past 10 years.
Some crucial evidence has been denied to Justice Hamilton. The Supreme Court
ruled last year that cabinet discussions cannot be probed by the tribunal or
the courts, as it would undermine cabinet confidentiality and the process of
government. Key documents relating to some allegations have simply
disappeared from government files as well as from the Goodman company.
When Justice Hamilton's findings are published later in the year, many of
the allegations may be left hanging ambiguously in the air. It is hoped,
however, that at least the tribunal may give some lessons for the future as
to how the intertwining strands of politics, business and government might
be better separated in Ireland.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Ad men plan the selling of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday was trying to distance itself from a
report due out today, which suggests it should centralise information about
the EC, in order to make it 'come alive, for the public'.
Brussels commissioned the report from 'outside experts' - mainly from public
relations and advertising companies - last November. Its own efforts to make
badly needed improvements in informing EC citizens about what 'Europe' does
have meanwhile been held in abeyance.
Senior officials directly involved in the exercise have received the report
with undisguised dismay - and Euro-expletives. They are, above all, angered
at the patronising tone and political insensitivity of its recommendations,
at a time when ratification of the Maastricht treaty still hangs on approval
by Danish voters and the British parliament.
The report, which is simply advisory, recommends the Commission should
immediately establish a centralised 'office of communications' to 'ensure
that the EC speaks with one voice'. It would be involved in securing
'binding agreements' after every main decision about 'the message to
communicate and the means for its communication'.
This is probably the most inflammatory ingredient in a cocktail of ideas,
some of which border on mysticism, and others of which are sub-Orwellian.
Promoting the Maastricht treaty, the report says, is to try to sell the
wrong product. The EC should be 'positioned' as 'a branded product', to
promote the idea of 'togetherness', with symbols which, for instance, would
make the Commission appear 'sympathetic, warm and caring'.
To this end, it recommends a 'Europe '99' programme for 'the third
millennium', with 'mystical connotations'; a June 1994 summit to explain 'a
better tomorrow'; batteries of public relations experts advising on
presentation; orchestrated national pro-EC campaigns; Euro-wide political
parties; Euro-sports teams; and discounted advertising prices for
Euro-propaganda campaigns.
To get away from the dry, boring text of Maastricht, it proposes the slogan:
European Union; Together to promote Progress and Prosperity, Protection and
Peace; Together for Europe to the Benefit of Us All.
Though the report is interspersed with sensible ideas, like more frequent
press and conferences by commissioners and national ministers to explain
their actions, or pamphlets and advertising to explain opportunities opened
by 'Europe', the judgment in Brussels is uniformly negative.
'They are trying to sell the Community like corn flakes,' said one official.
Another, credited with being an effective exponent of EC policy, said 'it
makes me want to weep'.
A senior official newly appointed to clean up the EC's image said 'they are
telling us to do things we will certainly refuse to do. We need to provide
information and make sure people can participate and explain their hopes in
the debate. That is something we knew already, it's common sense; this is
not.'
The report is due to be presented today by the chairman of the committee
which prepared it, Mr Willy de Clercq, the senior Belgian politician and
MEP.
However, a spokesman for Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, made
clear yesterday that the report 'is not the Commission's view'.
At today's meeting, several commissioners, especially those from Denmark and
Britain, are expected to demand that this is made abundantly clear.

FT  31 MAR 93 / German industry may have to recycle its goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN industry may soon become responsible for taking back and recycling
the goods it sells, as the cabinet today considers a controversial bill
drafted by the federal environment ministry.
The bill, the first of its kind in Europe, says industrial producers will be
responsible for collecting and recycling the waste they produce.
Manufacturers will also have to prove that no recycling is possible before
being able to incinerate their products or send them to waste deposits. The
bill forbids export of any remaining waste.
The environment ministry hopes such a law will force industry to create
products that can be more easily recycled and re-used in the economy and
reduce the increasing amount of industrial waste it produces.
The German Industry and Trade Federation attacked the proposal, saying it
would lead to heavy bureaucracy and burden enterprises financially. It
warned that smaller enterprises would not be able to bear the higher costs
the law would add to their already tight budgets.
The federation criticised German efforts to implement drastic environmental
laws unilaterally, saying the issues should be dealt with by the European
Commission in Brussels.
The Chemical Industry Federation criticised the restriction that the law
would place on burning waste. 'Waste incineration is not always
unecological, especially if energy can be produced as a result,' said Mr
Manfred Ritz, the federation spokesman. The federation warned that the law
would force producers to increase their end-prices.
Moves to recycle goods have already been made by some German producers, such
as the motor vehicle industry, which is devising ways car components could
be re-used. Deutsche Telekom, the state telecommunications monopoly,
announced last month it would create, together with the industrial groups
Preussag and Alcatel Sel, a company to recycle the telecommunications
equipment it sells.
The bill follows a similar law, adopted in 1991, which forces industrial
producers to take back and recycle consumer packaging.
But the law, which led to creation of a nation-wide packaging collection
network, called Deutsche System Deutschland, has recently come under attack
by green lobbyists, who claim it only collects packaging and does not ensure
its final recycling.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Treuhand steel initiative: EC approval sought for subsidies
in the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising east German industry,
is to seek European Community approval for government subsidies to modernise
the giant Ekostahl steelworks at Eisenhuttenstadt, near the Polish border,
writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
However, Germany's steel producers' association warned that any subsidies
for the east's steel sector would risk reopening the debate about
subsidising other loss-making mills, particularly in Italy and Spain.
Modernising Ekostahl will cost more than DM1.1bn (Dollars 653.2m). The first
phase of investments, earmarked for modernising the cold rolling mill, will
require subsidies of over DM310m. The second phase, which envisages building
a mini-mill, will cost DM750m. Treuhand officials have insisted that
government subsidies will not be 'indefinite', adding that it will guarantee
about 80 per cent of the first DM310m investment plan, while the remainder
of this phase will be financed by public subsidies.
They also argue that the mini-mill will consume cheap scrap instead of
relying on iron ore and coke, will make a narrow range of competitive
products with a much smaller labour force, and will be in a position to
attract a foreign partner. Ekostahl's labour force has already been reduced
from 11,500 in 1990 to 3,400 by early 1993.
'The EC will have to consider the trade-off between cuts in capacity and
aid,' a Treuhand official said. Ekostahl has already sharply reduced its
annual capacity from 2.8m tonnes in 1990, to under 1m tonnes by the
beginning of this year. The mini-mill would produce an overall annual
capacity of 900,000 tonnes. At the same time, the work force would be
further reduced to under 1,000.
Treuhand and Ekostahl officials, who for political and economic reasons are
keen to modernise the plant because the entire region is dependent on it,
said west Germany's steel producers are likely to oppose the plan. 'They are
challenging not only the high level of subsidies, but they fear more
competition from within the steel industry itself.'
The rescue package is now being considered by the finance ministry, and is
expected to be discussed by EC industry ministers in Brussels on May 4.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Energy treaty near on helping ex-Soviet bloc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 50 signatories of the European energy charter could finalise a
legally-binding agreement by the summer on how to help the former Soviet
Union exploit its energy resources, according to the chairman of talks on
the charter.
The ideals of the December 1991 political declaration which launched the
charter cannot be put into effect until a legally-binding treaty is agreed.
But Mr Charles Rutten, chairman of the talks, indicated yesterday that a
majority of countries could sign such a treaty and press ahead with
implementation of the charter, even if single members continued to resist.
Advocates of the charter believe it will help kick-start market economies in
the former Communist eastern bloc, by guaranteeing stable conditions for
investment in the east's dilapidated energy system.
Mr Rutten told journalists that last week's full session of the charter
talks, attended by members of the Community and the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as almost all east and
central European countries, had reached agreement on a number of central
aspects of the treaty.
But he has had to revise initial predictions that a treaty could be signed
in May, because of a series of outstanding problems.
They include the need to dove-tail a treaty with existing commitments under
the Gatt agreement and continuing resistance from Norway over clauses which
would prevent members treating foreign energy companies less favourably than
their own national groups.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (27): A basic guide for the visitor -
Contacts are usually readily accessible - but make appointments before you
travel, urges Bob Baker / Contacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOB BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Communicating with contacts in Guernsey, from almost any part of the world,
is relatively straight forward by international subscriber dialling,
facsimile or telex. The island's telecommunications are run by Guernsey
Telecoms, an autonomous trading department of the insular government that
has its own local directory inquiry service.
From the UK and Jersey, calls to Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and Herm need the
prefix code 0481 and international calls need the code 44 481.
Inward postal, freight and courier services are reliable with rapid delivery
times on the island. The Bailiwick of Guernsey's postal services have been
run since 1969 by the Guernsey Post Office, another autonomous trading
department of the insular government.
There are regular scheduled air passenger services into Guernsey from not
only Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Southampton - with flying times of
under an hour - but also from other UK regional airports and several
European airports.
A conventional, roll-on, roll-off passenger/car ferry service operates
between Guernsey and Poole but the fastest scheduled crossings - 2 1/4 hours
 -are from Weymouth by high-speed passenger ferries including a new
passenger/car 'wave-piercing' catamaran. There are also various sea
transport links into Guernsey from Jersey, Alderney, Sark, Cherbourg and St
Malo.
It is sensible to make prior appointments with contacts in Guernsey before
travelling to the island and to be aware that scheduled air services can be
disrupted from time to time by fog.
Visitors travelling by sea will arrive at St Peter Port Harbour just a short
walk or road journey from any St Peter Port destination. For those arriving
by air there is bus service or a 20-minute car journey into town.
Contacts are usually readily accessible, partly because the island is small.
A leisurely drive around most of Guernsey along the coast roads takes only
about 45 minutes - even when cruising below the maximum speed limit of
35mph.
The Guernsey telephone directory, published annually each May, is an
invaluable tool for anyone trying to contact not only individual residents
or businesses but also official and voluntary bodies.
Three pages containthe names and telephone numbers of official contacts
within island government and public administration. This list is headed by
members of The Royal Court of Guernsey, every local politician and parish
official, plus the names and addresses of all States of Guernsey
Departments.
There is a Yellow Pages section at the end of the directory. In addition,
there is a section explaining the island's public warning systems in the
event of big disasters or emergencies, including nuclear accidents. Guernsey

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (26): Chancellor mans the petrol pumps -
His committee is the primary forum for discussing tax and spending issues /
Profile:  Conseiller Roydon Falla
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE in Guernsey who objects to paying 20 per cent income tax should have
no problem tracking down the chancellor of the exchequer to make their views
known - especially if they drive a car.
Conseiller Roydon Falla, the man who has presented the island's budget for
the past decade, is to be found on alternate Saturday afternoons operating
the pumps at his petrol station. 'It keeps me in touch with my customers,'
he says. 'And parishioners still think of me as one of their
representatives.'
Falla, a tenacious 71-year-old, has a twinkle in his eye and his feet firmly
rooted on the island on which he was born. He recently returned from a trip
to London to receive an OBE in the New Year Honours Lists - the three
letters have already been added to his business cards. But he has never
seriously considered moving away from Guernsey.
The title chancellor is misleading, although one he is frequently given
since he posed for journalists clutching a donated suitcase in the style of
the British chancellor of the exchequer's red budget box. In fact, Mr
Falla's formal title is president of the advisory and finance committee.
Guernsey's government runs by majority vote, not by a cabinet issuing
diktats. He certainly does not have the final say in the annual patterns of
revenue-raising and expenditure.
But his role is of vital importance. The committee is the primary forum for
discussing tax and spending issues. It also scrutinises every policy letter
issued by the island's other committees, and it can attach a comment
disagreeing with the recommendations if it chooses.
While he may leave the minutiae of technical issues to others, Mr Falla is
regarded as an effective chairman able to steer discussion, listen to
arguments and steer decision-making.
Next year he plans to retire from politics to focus on his hobbies: snooker
and gardening. It will make a change from the battles he has fought,
including a vote of no confidence in his committee and the presentation of
an alternative budget by a rival.
'I have lost customers because of decisions I have taken,' he says. 'I
approved the closing of the school where my children were educated. But I
believed it was right. My first priority must be the island.'
Mr Falla has been involved in local politics for many years. His uncle had
been a deputy before the war, and his wife's father was a deputy. He sat on
the police committee, the local school committee and the parish council.
He was prepared for a fight when he stood for election as the deputy for
Torteval district in 1970, but the incumbent decided to stand down and he
was elected without opposition for two three-year terms. Then in 1976, he
was selected by the electoral college as one of the island's 12 conseillers.
He pauses for a long time when asked why he has survived in politics. 'I
think people trust my judgment,' he says cautiously. 'I have always kept a
low profile, but I think I can cut through the cackle.'
He served as president of the housing authority and the police committee,
and vice-president of the civil service board. In the meantime, he was
running his businesses - a plumbing and electrical contracting company, and
a garage.
He admits to a tension in the future of the island's economy. 'We must
protect and look after the finance sector and make sure it stays,' he says.
But he winces at the mention of the phrase 'offshore centre. 'The feeling I
get is that we are respected as a financial centre,' he says. 'We never went
out to become one. But it's a highly competitive market now and we have to
go out and get business.'
He also recognises the difficulties raised by the lack of diversity, which
has been driven by the decline of horticulture as much as the growth in
finance. He wants to see the expansion of what he calls the 'visitor
economy', and also stresses the development of trade links with France. But
he wants to see only growth which does not put pressure on the island's
limited space or workforce.
Mr Falla sees no need to change Guernsey's relationship with the EC. And he
does not anticipate any change to the long-standing policy of maintaining a
balanced budget. 'It's really good house-keeping,' he says. 'If we can't
afford something, we don't do it.'
But says he would like to reduce the island's reliance on income tax, and he
supports moves to consider the introduction of some form of value-added tax,
if the difficulties of inflation and collection can be overcome. If progress
is made on that issue in the next few months, his political battles are
certainly not yet over.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (25): Good profits - yet unlimited local
calls cost only 3.5p - The board even considered providing five years of
free calls / Guernsey Telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DIGARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUERNSEY'S ability to function efficiently as an international offshore
finance centre depends on its telecommunication links with the outside world
 -and their reliability.
Charged with providing them is Guernsey Telecoms, a trading board of the
States (Parliament) of Guernsey which has been independent since its
formation on July 28 1898 to serve just 70 customers wIth 15 staff.
Since then, it has developed as a commercially-run, financially
self-sufficient organisation meeting the needs of 36,000 customers in the
Bailiwick.
The board has just had to halt installation of optical fibre links between
the exchange and customers because technology has not kept pace with its
development plans. And that, in turn, has helped to leave the board with a
surplus of funds.
The finance sector-led growth in the 1980s - and high interest rates
generated by surpluses from its Pounds 10m-a-year turnover - left Guernsey
Telecoms with Pounds 4m more than it needed for capital developments. So it
decided to give some of it back to customers.
'The board was of the opinion that to continue to hold such surplus funds,
especially with today's economic background, would not be to the best
advantage of either Guernsey Telecoms or the people of the Bailiwick,' says
Mr Barry Lovell, board president and Deputy (member of the States'
Parliament), whose staff totals 285 with a payroll of Pounds 5.26m.
Commercial and private line rental charges have been held at just Pounds 6 a
quarter, for the past 16 years. Local calls cost 3.5p for an unlimited time
and prices were last increased eight years ago.
The board wanted to release about Pounds 3m to the States of Guernsey to use
in projects to stimulate the economy. It hoped to use the remaining Pounds
1m to give its customers free local calls for a year.
The board did toy with the idea of using the whole Pounds 4m to the benefit
of customers by providing free local calls for at least five years - but
decided that would be politically unacceptable.
In the event, after much debate, the States decided to appropriate the whole
amount for local economic development.
Until 1973, Guernsey Telecoms solely provided a telephone service for the
Bailiwick and the connections with neighbouring Jersey. In that year,
however, it added to its responsibilities the trunk system connecting
Guernsey to the UK, which was previously managed by British Telecom.
Inter-island links are provided by microwave radio and communications with
the rest of the world are through two submarine cables, one analogue and the
other a digital optical fibre cable, which came into service in 1989.
They connect the islands to the UK and are jointly owned by Guernsey
Telecoms, Jersey Telecoms and British Telecom.
'If any one of these systems is damaged, this network provides a diverse
route for all our links to the UK, thus ensuring that communications both
with the UK and internationally are maintained,' says Mr Ken Guille,
Guernsey Telecoms director.
'Should all else fail, a 'hot standby' microwave radio link between Guernsey
and Britain provides an emergency back-up service,' he says.
Planning is well advanced for installing two more fibre optic submarine
cables. 'This will ensure that both growth and security of digital services
between the islands and the mainland are adequately catered for,' Mr Guille
says.
'One of the proposed cables will be routed from Goonhilly in Cornwall to
terminate in Jersey. The second cable, which is the first ever to be
wholly-funded by Guernsey and Jersey Telecoms, will be provided between the
islands.
'This will complete a fibre ring between the UK and the Channel Islands,
thus improving the security of communications between us,' he says.
Mr Len Le Page, Guernsey Telecoms network services controller, says that the
importance of continuity of service cannot be over-emphasised, especially
for financial sector customers.
'For them it is vital. There are now so many computer links between Guernsey
and the UK that the service has to be completely reliable.
'Under international targets for telephony, we have to achieve 99.997 per
cent reliability and we hit it. We are there.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (24): Well serviced with sea and air
links - From April a new catamaran car ferry will run between Weymouth and
Guernsey / How to get there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUERNSEY is well serviced with sea and air links both to the British
mainland and France.
The traditional method is by sea using British Channel Island Ferries. A
conventional roll on-roll off car ferry leaves Poole five times a week
during the winter and every day between April 1 and October 31.
The ferry leaves Poole at 9pm and arrives in Guernsey at 6.15am. It goes on
to Jersey - then leaves Jersey for Poole via Guernsey at 9.45am. It arrives
in Guernsey at 12.15 and Poole at 6pm. The day-time journey is shorter than
the overnight one.
The basic fare in Summer for a standard return for a family of four with a
car works out at Pounds 360. A four-berth cabin with shower and lavatory
would be Pounds 15 for an overnight journey.
There are cheaper off-season fares and various budget-saver schemes. British
Channel Island Ferries can be contacted in Poole (Tel: 0202 681155). From
April 1 a new high-speed car ferry will operate between Weymouth and the
Channel Islands. Condor is launching a new 74m wave-piercing car and
passenger-carrying catamaran. There will be two sailings each day from
Weymouth; one direct to Guernsey, the other via Jersey. The fastest journey
time will be 2 1/4 hours.
The Condor catamaran, which can carry 90 cars plus 600 passengers, will join
the existing passenger-only catamaran which has been operating for the past
two summer seasons, carrying more than 250,000 passengers. There will
therefore be three services a day from Weymouth. The car service will
continue through the winter. The passenger-only service will run from April
until November.
The fares are set at Pounds 160 return for a car, Pounds 70 for an adult
single and 50 per cent of the adult fare for a child between 4-13 years.
These tariffs are similar to those on the British Channel Island Ferries
service.
British Rail offers through fares to Guernsey: by train from any station to
Weymouth, then on by Condor. Condor's Weymouth phone number is 0305 761551.
By sea to continental Europe there are a number of services to Carteret,
Dielette, Granville, Perros Guirec, Portbail, St Malo and St Quay Portrieux.
Many of these services are run by Emeraude Ferries. The company can be
contacted on 33 52 61 39 in Carteret and 33 50 16 36 in Granville.
There are numerous air connections. The main routes are from Gatwick and
Heathrow. Jersey European and City Flyer run what amounts to a shuttle
service to Gatwick with almost 10 flights a day between them throughout the
year. Air UK runs a number of flights each day to Heathrow.
As well as flights to London there are services to 18 other UK regional
airports, including Belfast, Birmingham, Stansted, Exeter, Norwich and
Manchester.
Aurigny Air Services, the official airline of Alderney which recently
celebrated its 25th anniversary, runs a regular service from Alderney to
Southampton. The return Apex fare is Pounds 99. Jersey European charges
Pounds 150 for a business class return in the winter. The airline can be
contacted via a central booking agency (Tel: 0345 078400). The number for
City Flyer Express is Tel 0345 222111. Air UK can be contacted on Tel: 0345
666777.
There are numerous direct flights to Europe from Guernsey. KLM Cityhopper
flies to Amsterdam. Delta Air flies to Stuttgart, Crossair goes to Zurich.
Lufthansa Cityline flies to Dusseldorf, Frankfurt and Hamburg. These
services are not as frequent as flights to the UK mainland.
Aurigny, on the other hand, makes regular trips to Dinard and Cherbourg. It
also provides an air taxi service between Guernsey and Jersey, and Guernsey
and Alderney.
The service to Alderney is particularly useful in that there is no boat
service between Guernsey and Alderney. There are, however, regular sea
ferries from Guernsey to Sark and Herm, run by local companies.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (23): Post Office put Guernsey on the map
 -Stamps and coins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DIGARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT many businesses find their products automatically snapped up by the
public and then posted on to friends and acquaintances. Yet with stamps this
is the very nature of the game - and one which Guernsey plays very well.
The Guernsey Post Office is a small administration with rather more than
61,000 potential letter-posters in its Bailiwick fold. But it has
established an international reputation as one of the stamp world's most
progressive contributors.
Until 1969, the postal affairs of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark
and Herm were administered by its British counterpart. Then rationalisation
of the system offered the opportunity of postal independence.
On October 1 that year, the Guernsey Post Office took responsibility for all
postal services; everything from painting the pillar boxes to producing the
stamps. And the newly-elected Post Office Board took the opportunity to put
the island on the map, as far as stamp collectors were concerned.
'Success was instant,' says Mr Paul Veron, Director of Post. 'Queues around
the block at the main St Peter Port post office that first day indicated the
degree of local interest and it wasn't long before the world at large wanted
to collect Guernsey stamps.'
Philatelic sales from October 1 until the end of the first full year of
trading totalled Pounds 348,000; equivalent to nearly Pounds 3m today.
'The short time-span since 1969 makes Guernsey very attractive from a
collector's point of view, since it offers the chance to acquire the
complete collection quite easily and serious collectors do love
completeness,' says Mr Veron.
Last year the Philatelic Bureau alone achieved sales of more than Pounds 1m,
he says. 'Add to that the business done through agents and the figure
approaches Pounds 2m.'
Dealers also have confidence in local stamp issues. Mr Ian Wood, managing
director of the Channel Island Stamp Company, a mail-order business which is
one of Britain's top 10 philatelic companies, says: 'There have been some
complaints that Guernsey makes too many issues but compared with some other
Commonwealth administrations the Post Office is very restrained. Quality is
always high and they always sell.'
The island receives a double benefit from operating its own postal
administration. Profits from the philatelic operation, which totalled Pounds
450,000 last year, are given to the island's exchequer while the compact
size of the administration means that the postal operation only offers a
first-class, same-day delivery priced at 16p. The equivalent rate to the UK
is 23p.
The Guernsey Post Office employs 228 staff and revenue from the postal side
is estimated to reach Pounds 5.2m this year, with a surplus of nearly Pounds
100,000.
Guernsey also issues its own currency - and makes a profit on that, too.
States of Guernsey notes were first issued in 1817 as a way of paying for
coastal defence work, building a monument and repairing a parish church
without having to borrow.
Some Pounds 4,000 was issued, subject to redemption in three stages over the
following two years.
What was later to become known as the Guernsey Experiment was successful and
further issues were made, including a Pounds 5 note in 1826.
The value of the currency was not underwritten by the island's economy -
which at that time was poor following the Napoleonic wars - but by a special
tax approved by the Privy Council of a shilling a gallon on all spirits
imported into Guernsey.
In 1921 the currency was changed to sterling and it continued to be printed
locally, even while Guernsey was under German occupation from 1940 until
1945.
Today, Guernsey has about Pounds 15m worth of its own money in circulation
alongside sterling.
Mr Mike Brown, States Supervisor (chief of the island's civil service) and
until last year former States Treasurer, says that local currency, produced
by the Royal Mint to Guernsey designs, is kept to the same dimensions as the
UK's 'for practical reasons'. The most significant difference is the
island's insistence on retaining its own Pounds 1 note in preference to the
Pounds 1 coin.
'We did issue about Pounds 250,000 worth of coins but you do not see them
now. We will continue printing pound notes while people want them,' says Mr
Brown.
He says that issuing local currency is equivalent to receiving an
interest-free loan of the same amount. The net interest on it is about
Pounds 1m a year.
'That accrues to general revenue each year and saves us having to raise
additional tax. To raise the same amount would mean an additional 17p on a
packet of cigarettes,' he says.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (21): Each island is fiercely independent
 -Alderney, Sark and Herm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE small islands of Alderney, Sark and Herm come under the Bailiwick of
Guernsey with the Bailiff of Guernsey as their civil head and chief justice.
But Alderney, 3.5 miles long and 1.5 miles wide, with 2,500 people, has its
own parliament.
Sark, with about 600 people, has a hereditary ruler, a government called the
Court of Chief Pleas, no income tax and no cars. Visitors explore the island
by horse and cart, bicycle or on foot.
There are no cars, either, on the tiny 500-acre island of Herm, leased to,
and run by, the Wood family since 1949 on the understanding that tourists -
about 100,000 in a busy summer - would be catered for and the island's
beauty protected. About 500 people live here today, running the hotel, gift
shops, pub, school, dairy and oyster farms.
'Each island is fiercely independent but we all depend on each other,' said
Mr Christopher Brock, who will be taking over as Guernsey's new director of
tourism in September. 'Marketing the group isn't easy - we found only one in
10 Europeans knew where Guernsey was, though if you said the Channel
Islands, it was a little higher. And how do you translate 'The Bailiwick?''
'The Germans, Scandinavians and Dutch are fascinated by islands,' he said.
'We have to get across the idea of the Channel Islands first, and then how
the Bailiwick of Guernsey has its own uniqueness.'
If not too many Europeans know about Guernsey as a holiday resort, fewer
still would instantly think of Alderney as a finance centre. The idea brings
wry smiles from some on Guernsey.
But, already, in the cobbled streets of St Anne's, there are four leading
banks, three accountancy firms and two legal practices, a British building
society, and two insurance agencies.
A new company offering a range of financial services has recently been
established.
The island might be small - its budget is just over Pounds 4m - but what
does that matter if you have modern communications technology? It has no
VAT, no taxes on capital or inheritance, none on exempt companies with
business outside the islands, or on trusts whose beneficiaries live
elsewhere.
There is a low tax (20 per cent) on the profits of business companies and
residents' income, and preferential arrangements are made for captive
insurance companies based on the island. Some 500 companies are at present
registered there.
'We've always been open for business,' said Mrs Eileen Sykes, chairman of
Alderney's Finance Committee. 'And when we saw how successful Guernsey and
Jersey were in l988, we thought we'd try and attract more finance houses.
'At that time, we also thought we'd have quite a serious budget deficit but
fortunately we didn't. In fact, we've always finished the year with a
surplus, though not a very large one.'
'We need to change peoples' attitudes,' said Mr David Jenkins, Clerk of the
States. 'When senior management think of the Channel Islands, they think of
Jersey, then Guernsey and they've never heard of Alderney. It's a matter of
getting to them and persuading them to come.'
Mr Mike Aireton, a former war office bacteriologist, had enough faith in
Alderney to invest in the building of Ollivier Court, an office development
in St Anne's. Only five of the 29 units, he said, were still empty.
'Alderney is the only island that has no entry restrictions at all,' he said
enthusiastically. 'Anyone can come - and you're not going to get mugged on
the way to the bank.'
Mr Christopher Sykes had just arrived from London to become administrator
and financial director for Dubarry Trustees whose staff has increased from
one to seven in five years.
He was optimistic about his career in Alderney. 'Vanuatu is a thriving
offshore island in the middle of the Pacific with thousands of financial
services. It's not famous for anything else. One day, looking back, people
may say the same about Alderney.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (22): 'Sark lark' legislation - The
island is a feudal fiefdom with a system of government and taxation still
independent of the British mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sark may no longer take seriously its feudal obligation to provide 40 men
with muskets to defend the English Crown, but the tiny island still feels
the effects of its obligations to the British government.
Sark - which is just a 40-minute ferry ride from Guernsey - remains a feudal
fiefdom with a system of government and taxation still resolutely
independent of the British mainland.
Gone is the corvee or requirement of every male resident to offer labour
each year for local public works. Gone too are the droits de seigneur,
requiring islanders to seek permission to marry and to hand over every tenth
sheaf of wheat grown on the island.
Britain recently offered Sark the chance to buy out its lingering sixteenth
century requirement to pay one twentieth of the cost of a knight's fee each
year: currently Pounds 1.79.
But Mr Michael Beaumont, 66, the Seigneur of Sark since the death in 1974 of
Dame Sibyl Hathaway, his grandmother, has more important worries. He
believes the feudal system continues to work well.
He is more concerned about the ever-extending grasp of international
bureaucracy.
He raises his hand a foot above a table, indicating the volume of forms and
documents which arrived in the latest despatch from Whitehall.
'It's frightening to see the paperwork coming through,' he says. 'I worry
about the international agreements and regulations. They insist on such fine
detail. It is putting a strain on our means.'
Ten years ago, Sark dumped most of its litter into the sea. Now most must be
sent to Guernsey for disposal.
New EC requirements have called for no milk produced locally to be sold
unless it is pasteurised.
That would mean sending it by boat to be treated. 'We can no more afford
that than to fly to the moon,' he says. 'It's absurd.'
Such issues seem far removed from the impression of a traditional way of
life on Sark, with its craggy cliffs, dusty roads and tractors. Cars are
banned. Just 560 people live in often crumbling pre-fabricated buildings on
an island of only two square miles.
In fact, Sark has long maintained strong links with the outside world. Only
about two-fifths of its residents were born on the island and there is a
constant stream of new arrivals. Tourism is a mainstay of the economy.
There is also another, infamous source of income, which until recently
explained the vast number of faxes coming to the island, and the many
executives in suits who crammed in with the tourists on the ferries,
returning to Guernsey on the next boat. It was called the 'Sark lark'.
By recruiting a number of Sark-resident directors, and holding formal board
meetings on the island, companies were able to be Sark-based for tax - or
offshore even from the Guernsey tax authorities.
The Bailiwick has reduced that scope with a recent law which allows its own
resident companies to be tax exempt. But some jurisdictions, such as the
British Virgin Islands, still use Sark as an offshore centre.
Many vestiges of the ancient feudal system do remain. The island is divided
into 40 freehold lots of about 30 acres each which cannot be further
subdivided. None can be sold without the permission of the seigneur, they
can only be bought by British citizens, and the heir to the land has the
right to repurchase it if it is sold to someone else.
Leaseholders can live on the land, but they must be resident on the island
for 15 years before they may build a house.
Sark is entirely self-financing. It raised about Pounds 220,000 last year, a
lot of which went on teachers' salaries and much of which was raised by
excise duties and landing fees on visitors.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (20): Norman French titles and roles -
Richard Evans takes a look at a system that has survived the centuries
remarkably intact / Profile: The bailiff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the UK, the title bailiff has been debased to mean the repossessor of a
debtor's goods, but in Guernsey it has retained its original meaning of the
sovereign's representative in a district.
The bailiff is the equivalent of the lord chancellor, presiding over the
royal court and the legislature and heading the island's administration.
Given that Guernsey, like Jersey and the Isle of Man, is a virtually
independent democracy in domestic affairs, it is a post of the greatest
local importance.
Lists on the walls of the spacious, panelled offices of the current bailiff,
Mr Graham Dorey, show an unbroken line of bailiffs going back to William de
Saint Remy in 1278 - and the office existed before then.
The island, with neighbouring Jersey, was integrated into the Duchy of
Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries and became a dependent territory of
the English crown when the duke, William, became king of England in 1066.
When continental Normandy was overrun by the king of France in 1204, the
islands remained under the English king, who continued to govern them in his
capacity as duke of Normandy.
The rule continued after the title was dropped.
Their separate laws, customs and liberties were later confirmed by the
charters of successive sovereigns, which secured the islands their own
judiciaries, freedom from the processes of the English courts, and certain
other privileges.
The office of bailiff is at the apex of a system that has survived the
centuries remarkably intact and has retained many of the original Norman
French titles and roles. Ironically, these were largely abolished in
Normandy itself at the time of the French revolution.
In some respects, such as inheritance, bankruptcy and family legislation,
local law still differs considerably from that in the UK. Most criminal and
commercial law has come increasingly into line, though.
Mr Dorey, like all recent incumbents, is a Guernseyman and a lawyer. He has
been in office for just over a year, having climbed the ranks of the law
officers appointed by the British crown of comptroller (or
solicitor-general), procureur (attorney-general) and deputy bailiff, an
office created in 1969 because of the increasing work load.
Before that, Mr Dorey was in private practice as a Guernsey advocate, having
gone through the obligatory process of a six-month course at Caen university
to study Norman law as well as qualifying at the English Bar.
He does not believe there is any conflict of interest between the judicial
and administrative functions of the office. 'There could be in theory, but
if we see one in prospect we head it off. I would avoid it by not sitting in
court, for example. My place could be taken by my deputy or by a judge from
the English court of appeal.'
One of the bailiff's tasks is to head deputations from the States - the
local parliament - to the Home Office, which is responsible for relations
between the UK and the Channel Islands, on any conflict or concern. The only
significant delegation recently was over French fishing rights at the Schole
Bank off the island. This had been a matter of dispute for 20 years but
after visits to London and Paris the matter was resolved.
A much less easily resolved matter has been the sensitive issue of Guernsey
and the German occupation from 1940 to 1945. Mr Dorey has played a prominent
part in refuting allegations of wholesale collaboration and black
marketeering by islanders that appeared when records were opened for
inspection early this year.
'A lot of extremely offensive and false material was circulated and there
has been a great deal of misunderstanding. . . our files show that at the
express instruction of the British government the island authorities
remained in being and acted as a buffer against the Germans on behalf of the
small remaining population.
'Refusal (to obey German orders) was not possible as to do so would only
have brought reprisals on a defenceless population,' Mr Dorey said.
The Dorey family has lived on Guernsey for about 400 years, but although
forebears have been deputies and jurats - the 12 elected people who in
effect constitute a permanent jury - none has been bailiff before.
Mr Dorey acknowledges there is a belief that Guernsey is dominated by seven
extended families, but he is adamant that this does not affect the choice of
bailiff.
'It is a delicate subject, but it is quite false to say the role only goes
to old families. The position is open to all.' He estimates that out of the
past nine bailiffs, only two came from families which had previously filled
the post, although the position was very different in the last century and
before.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (19): A good range of accommodation -
Angela Wigglesworth discovers that the island also has an extraordinary
number of restaurants / Where to stay and dine out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN the 1960s, when British Rail gave its employees free transport, they
flocked in their thousands to holiday in Guernsey.
These were bucket-and-spade families with young children, and guest houses
and self-catering establishments flourished. Today, the island caters for
different visitors, most of them more than 45 years old, who want more
sophisticated facilities and come for what the island has not got - theme
parks, star-name entertainment and muggings - as much as for what it has:
fine beaches, leisurely life-style and friendly people.
There is a good range of accommodation with four five-crown hotels.
Guernsey's crown rating is one higher than its equivalent AA or RAC star
rating.
'We look for quality rather than just a tick list,' says Mr Mich Agnelli,
the senior inspector of hotels. The island has an extraordinary number of
restaurants - 44 of them in St Peter Port alone. Table d'hote four-course
menus are priced from about Pounds 9 to Pounds 15. One reason for this may
be because all pubs (along with garages) are closed on Sundays and a
restaurant is the only place to have a drink.
The flagship for the large hotels is undoubtedly the island's first and only
purpose-built five-crown hotel, the St Pierre Park (Tel: 0481 728282). Set
in 45 acres of parkland overlooking a lake, it has 135 bedrooms, six suites,
popular restaurants (the Victor Hugo and the more informal Cafe Renoir),
indoor heated pool, well-equipped Health Suite, gymnasium, tennis courts and
a Tony Jacklin-designed nine-hole golf course. There are conference rooms
for 20-200 people. Bed and breakfast is from Pounds 130 to Pounds 250 for a
double or twin-bedded room.
A smaller but excellent family hotel is La Favorita (Tel: 0481 35666) which
has four crowns and is run by Mr Simon Wood, who was brought up on Herm, and
his wife, Helen. Located in a wooded valley with views over the bay, it
retains the atmosphere of the country house it once was. It has a heated
pool. It is particularly good for Sunday lunches and guests relax with their
Sunday newspapers well into the afternoon. Bed and breakfast is from Pounds
32, half board from Pounds 38. Package holidays are also available.
The four-crown La Fregate Hotel (Tel: 0481 724624), once an 18th-century
manor house, is a comfortable and friendly hotel with 13 well-equipped
bedrooms overlooking St Peter Port harbour. The town centre is a five
minutes' walk away, through its garden. The food is superb. A double room
costs Pounds 90; breakfast from Pounds 4.50.
An even smaller hotel, the three-crown eight-bedroom Midhurst House (Tel:
0481 724391) offers unbeatable value. All the prettily-furnished bedrooms
are en suite and the owner-chef makes his own bread and ice cream. Bed and
breakfast is from Pounds 20; half board from Pounds 28.
For something completely different, the four-crown White House Hotel (Tel:
0481 37711) on Herm offers a real away-from-it-all experience. The island's
only hotel, it is set in lovely gardens close to the harbour. Much-praised
food, swimming pool and tennis courts. Half board Pounds 50 a head.
La Grande Mare Hotel and Country Club (Tel: 0481 56576) has five crowns, Les
Routiers and RAC awards, and Guernsey's Restaurant of the Year for 1992.
Bedrooms, studios, suites and apartments, with a choice of four-poster or
single beds with hydraulic tilt action. Set in 100 acres with solar-heated
pool, croquet lawn, golf course, childrens' play area. A double room costs
Pounds 134 with half board.
Old Government House (Tel: 0481 724921) has five crowns. In the heart of St
Peter Port, it was once the official Governor's residence. There are 72 en
suite bedrooms with modern facilities and old-style comfort. Dancing at
weekends, adjoining night club, heated swimming pool. Bed and breakfast from
Pounds 39.
The Hotel Bella Luce (Tel: 0481 38764) has four crowns. It is a converted
old manor house, a stone's throw from Renoir's Moulin Huet Bay on the south
of the island. Excellent restaurant, heated swimming pool, sauna, solarium
and croquet lawn. Bed and breakfast from Pounds 30; half board from Pounds
39.
Moore's Hotel (Tel: 0481 724452). Four-crown. Historic granite-built town
house in St Peter Port with 48 rooms; conservatory restaurant (five-course
table d'hote and a la carte menu); library bar complete with books;
patisserie (light meals, Austrian cakes and herbal teas a speciality). Bed
and breakfast from Pounds 27; Pounds 35 half board.
Idlerocks Hotel (Tel: 0481 37711). Four crowns. Award-winning hotel,
traditional Sunday lunches, cream teas, five acres of gardens, heated
swimming pool and one of the best sea views in Europe. Bed and breakfast
from Pounds 29.50; half board Pounds 33.50.
Hotel de Havelet (Tel: 0481 722199). Four crowns. Georgian house overlooking
harbour with 34 bedrooms. Popular Wellington Boot Restaurant with
spectacular views of the castle. Bed and breakfast from Pounds 38; half
board from Pounds 44.50.
Cobo Bay Hotel (Tel: 0481 57102). Four crowns. Family-run hotel with 36
bedrooms, health suite. Bed and breakfast is from Pounds 29; half board from
Pounds 39.
L' Atlantique, Perelle Bay. (Tel: 0481 64056). Four crowns. 1992 local Salon
Culinaire winner. It has 21 rooms, two family suites, free car hire. Bed and
breakfast from Pounds 30; half board from Pounds 40.
Some highly recommended restaurants: The Absolute End - well worth going to
the end of the town for. Le Nautique - good food and good views over
harbour. Courts - open lunch-time and evenings, Monday to Friday: A la carte
and extensive vegetarian menu. Louisiana - Cajun specialities and music. Da
Nellos - popular Italian restaurant with low ceilings, romantic lighting.
Cafe du Moulin - attractive country restaurant.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (18): 'The Queen, our Duke' is the toast
 -Here you can learn everything you want to know about Guernsey / A guide to
the museums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUERNSEY was built on stone, said Mrs Rona Cole, the director of museums,
and the best way to find out about the island's history was to start with
the huge chunk of pink and blue granite to be found in the purpose-built and
award-winning Guernsey Museum and Art Gallery in Candie Gardens, St Peter
Port.
Here you can learn everything you want to know about Guernsey and why, when
islanders talk of the mainland today, they're not referring to France just
30 miles away and visible on a clear day, but England, 80 miles across the
Channel. And this, in spite of the fact that Guernsey's parliament spoke
French until well into this century, local people used a French patois until
the Second World War, and house deeds were in French until the 1950s.
The French connection started, as so much else, with William the Conqueror.
His duchy of Normandy included the Channel Islands - Les Iles Normandes -
and when he conquered England they became part of his realm.
In 1204, King John lost most of Normandy, but the Channel Islands remained
loyal to the English crown and have been so ever since. No islander can be
called up for military service - although some volunteer - unless it is to
protect the Sovereign and when it comes to a Royal toast, the Queen is 'The
Queen, our Duke'. Of Normandy, of course.
Occupation in Guernsey has been traced back to neolithic times and with the
recent discovery of a 4,500BC site, the island has what is thought to be the
earliest stone structure in western Europe. There are 2,000BC passage
graves, a megalithic tomb, and ancient churches such as the little chapel
built in 1392 with 14th century frescoes dedicated to St Apolline, the
patron saint of dentists (she had to have all her teeth out, apparently),
and the St Marie du Castel with its 13th century frescoes.
For Guernsey's maritime history, go to the superb new Maritime Museum in
Castle Cornet, the sturdy fortress that juts out into the sea to form an arm
of the harbour. Here you can learn about the island's nautical life from
Roman times to the present day, with a vivid reconstruction of an old
harbour scene complete with fishing boat, crane, tomato baskets and a hand
cart.
A video shows under-water excavation of a wrecked Roman vessel found a few
years ago in St Peter Port harbour by a local diver. He discovered it one
Christmas Day, the only day it is legal to dive in the harbour. He thought
it was nothing important and waited until the following Christmas to dive
again and discover that it was an exciting find.
Also in the castle is an art gallery, the 201 Squadron Museum, an armoury,
German occupation exhibits and a refectory for light meals.
Almost every bay in Guernsey has some kind of fortification built over the
centuries and the Tourist Board has launched an ambitious 'Fortress
Guernsey' project to restore several and open them up to the public. This
summer they hope to complete work on a German naval signals bunker which had
direct links with Berlin during the war and has not been opened since.
Several museums show exhibits depicting what it was like to live for five
years under German occupation in the Second World War. Many islanders were
evacuated to the UK and 2,000 were deported to camps in Germany. The German
Occupation Museum near the airport shows tableaux, bunker rooms, and a
lifesize street. La Valette Underground Military Museum, housed in a former
U-Boat fuel storage tunnel, has a display of Guernsey's military history.
One French visitor to whom Guernsey gave a friendly welcome was Victor Hugo.
Exiled from France in 1855, he took refuge and stayed for 15 years, living
in Hauteville House, St Peter Port, writing Les Miserables and dedicating
another book, The Toilers of the Sea, to Guernsey 'The Rock of Hospitality
and of Liberty' and its 'noble little people of the sea.' His house is open
to the public.
For a different kind of history, there's Guernsey's Telephone Museum, with
'hands-on' switchboards, teleprinters, telephones and enthusiastic staff to
explain how everything works.
Note: Several museums are shut in the winter months.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (17:) Castles, bunkers and carvings -
Guernsey has some rich legacies. Richard Digard takes a look at two of the
island's more unusual collections / History
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DIGARD

<TEXT>
BECAUSE of its closeness to mainland Europe, the Bailiwick of Guernsey has
occupied a position of strategic, commercial, naval and military importance
for almost 2,000 years.
Guernsey and the other islands played a leading role during that time and
have been left with a legacy of earthworks, castles, forts, towers,
batteries, arsenals and watch houses which underscores the intense periods
of military activity lasting from the late Neolithic period to the Second
World War.
One of the earliest defensive sites is at Jerbourg, where a promontory fort
was created in Neolithic times and later reformed during the Bronze Age.
The site, one of only three similar works in western Europe, survived into
the turbulent medieval period as a place of refuge for islanders and 14th
century records show it still to have been important when Castle Cornet, an
imposing structure guarding the capital, St Peter Port, was occupied by the
French for seven years.
Guernsey's Tourist Board and Ancient Monuments Committee have adopted a
'Fortress Guernsey' approach to telling the island's story and this is
centred on Castle Cornet which contains five separate museums, including the
award-winning Maritime Museum opened in 1991.
The Channel islands were the only British territory to be occupied by the
Germans in the Second World War and Guernsey is still littered with the
concrete remains of the invasion.
It lasted from June 1940 until May 1945 and during that time thousands of
slave workers were forced to build massive defensive bunkers, gun
emplacements and underground shelters.
Recording that part of the Bailiwick's history has been an obsession for Mr
Richard Heaume since he was a schoolboy. After the war, he rummaged for
bullets and shells in the sand pits of the abandoned Luftwaffe firing range
near his parents farm, which the family have owned since the 16th century.
The results are the German Occupation Museum, housed in old farm cottages
and visited by about 25,000 people a year.
'The museum could not be started now,' says Mr Heaume. 'The items simply are
no longer in existence. I suppose I happened to be in the right place at the
right time.'
Islanders originally opposed his interest in what had been a bleak period.
'After the occupation, people just wanted to forget and to get rid of the
remnants of occupation. I can remember entire German uniforms being used to
dress Guy Fawkes guys,' he says. 'Now, however, people know that what I've
done was right.'
The bulk of the museum, valued by Mr Heaume at more than Pounds 2m, was
salvaged from various German tunnels that had not been fully cleared after
the war. He opened the museum in May 1966 when he was aged 22 and he is
still adding to it - although the scarcity of items makes that difficult.
Obsession of another kind is preserved at Hauteville House, the cliffside St
Peter Port home where the exiled French author Victor Hugo spent 14 years
writing and decorating the interior of the house with wooden panelling,
carvings and wall hangings. The house, originally built in 1800 by an
islander grown rich on privateering, was given to the French by Hugo's
family in 1927 and continues to be administered from Paris.
It remains as it was when Hugo left on November 9, 1878 and is as much one
of his creations as his writings are.
'I missed my vocation, I was born to be an interior decorator,' he said
after buying the property on the proceeds of Les Contemplations, a volume of
poetry.
Helped by local artisans, he scoured the island and beyond for antique
chests, Delft tiles, silks, oriental carpets and tapestries, including four
Gobelins bought in 1856.
All were dismantled and then rebuilt according to Hugo's sketched designs.
The result is breathtaking.
'There is not a spare centimetre of wall or ceiling which is not adorned by
wood-carvings, tiles, tapestries or fabric,' says the curator, Mme
Marie-Christine Lorang, who is also the French consular agent in Guernsey.
One of her tasks is to co-ordinate the constant repair and renovation of the
house and its unique furnishings.
'We have to limit visitors to 15 at a time and are only open for six months
of the year,' she says. 'We need the other six months to carry out the
restoration work.' An average of 25,000 visitors a year are wearing away
what they come to see.
'Maintaining the furniture is no problem but the materials are more
difficult,' she says.
Some rooms have been closed because of the erosion.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (16): Fish farming may have greater role
 -Static prices are making it harder for skippers to remain within the
industry,  / The fishing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DIGARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS may be made by Guernsey's fishing industry to claim compensation
for sales lost because of action by French fishermen to prevent imports to
France.
The financial implications of the French protests are serious for the island
because as much as 20 per cent of all shellfish landed in Europe is caught
by Guernsey's small but highly efficient fishing fleet.
The industry employs 480 people directly and indirectly and was responsible
for nearly 1 per cent of the island's economy in 1991.
'We are currently investigating with the Home Office the possibilities of
claims for compensation to be made against the French government for any
financial losses incurred by local fishermen,' says Mr Ron Le Moignan,
president of the Sea Fisheries Committee.
Static prices in Europe generally, caused by the recession, are making it
harder for skippers to remain within the industry. Mr Steve Ozanne, sea
fisheries officer, says that prices for brown crab and spider crab - the
bulk of the island's 2,000-tonne annual landings - have remained unchanged
or fallen from their 1987 levels, although those for lobsters are holding
up.
'There's no doubt about it, the fleet are finding it hard going but it is a
very efficient industry and they are waiting for an upturn,' he says.
There are 285 registered fishing boats but only 64 work out of Guernsey on a
full-time basis. Poor prices have driven a handful of the larger vessels to
the west coast of Scotland where there are better catch rates.
A similar number of Guernsey-registered vessels operate from the northern
island of Alderney, fishing off the Casquets reef and in mid-Channel,
exporting their catches directly through the French port of Cherbourg. The
Guernsey catch is sent live in special tankers to French wholesalers who
re-export most of the catch to Spain by road.
'We estimate that the industry was worth a total of Pounds 6m in 1992. Of
that, Pounds 3.75m comes from exports, Pounds l25m from the home market and
Pounds lm from the Alderney operation,' said Mr Ozanne.
About 180 tonnes of high quality wet fish is landed annually and much of
this is sold through London's Billingsgate Market.
Fisheries receive minimal support from the States (Parliament) of Guernsey
with just Pounds 108,000 being provided in services in 1991.
'Our industry has developed without financial injections. It is reasonably
fit and lean and in a good position to take advantage of any upturn in the
European Community,' says Mr Le Moignan.
'We see a much greater role to be played in the development of fish farming
in the future - possibly under cover using redundant greenhouses and
vineries.'
The island is already an important oyster hatchery while one former
fisherman is poised to start exports of ormers (H. tuberculata, a northern
variety of abalone) to Britain's Chinese community.
Mr Dick Tostevin's hatchery overlooks the west coast bay Rocquaine, where he
is fattening the molluscs in huge underwater cages on a steady diet of
hand-cut seaweed. He came up with the idea 10 years ago.
'Fishing was getting increasingly difficult and I felt I was too old to move
out mid-Channel so we thought we'd farm ormers instead.'
It has been an uphill struggle. 'We are the only commercial hatchery in
Europe at the moment, although they are experimenting in France, so we have
had to find it all out for ourselves', he says.
Professor Michael Cully of Portsmouth Polytechnic provided the initial
start-up advice in 1983 and the Tostevins began producing seed which was
used in trials in sea-lochs in Carna, Ireland.
The trials were part-funded by Guernsey's Sea Fisheries Committee.
After three years, the Irish dropped the ormer in favour of a Japanese
variety. 'That was it. No more orders,' says Mr Tostevin. He and his wife,
Pam, had also been growing-on a small quantity of ormers, a prized local
delicacy, for local consumption.
'The Irish thing meant we were faced with either closing down the hatchery
or growing our own ormers - and I've always kind of believed in farming
ormers,' says Mr Tostevin.
Mr and Mrs Tostevin will know this October whether their faith has paid off;
that's when the first commercial harvesting is scheduled to take place.
After supplying the local market - the Guernsey recipe calls for ormers to
be shelled, beaten, fried and then slowly stewed - the Tostevins will export
the rest.
'It is the most expensive sea food in the world and the Chinese love it,' Mr
Tostevin says. 'They want live abalone and can only get poor quality black
market stuff through Billingsgate.' The project has provoked interest in New
Zealand, South Africa, Japan and Israel, where a laboratory is exploring the
possibility of feeding ormers on extensive beds of sea lettuce.
Guernsey Sea Farms operates Britain's only other commercial oyster hatchery
from a disused and flooded quarry on the island's north-east coast.
Mr Giles Greenhough, nursery manager, says that the quarry, connected to the
sea through a sluice and containing 45m gallons of sea water, produces 20
tonnes of seed a year.
'We mainly supply southern Ireland and Scotland with the Pacific, or Gigas,
oyster,' he says, 'and we are the second-biggest producer in Britain.'
A new customer is the National Rivers Authority which takes special sets of
oysters and uses them to test for pollution in coastal waters.
'The quicker they die, the more sewage pollution there Is in the water,'
says Mr Greenhough.
Brittany-born Mr Hugo Vajk has achieved a remarkable success selling
Guernsey oysters to the French. He farms eight acres of seabed off Herm and
last year produced 50 tonnes of oysters which were exported for further
on-growing to Scotland, Ireland and St Malo.
'l never thought I'd be selling to France,' he says, 'but the pound is so
low that you can now get quite a good return.' He believes, however, that
the chief reason for his success is the quality of his oysters.

The number of visitors to Guernsey has sunk to an all-time low, with a 20
per cent drop over the past two years. 'The biggest problem we face,' says
Mr Michael Walden, director of tourism, 'is that we are heavily locked into
the UK market, with 82 per cent of our business coming from there and when
that sinks, as it has done with the recession, we suffer.'
However, the recession, had done much to concentrate the minds of Guernsey
politicians on the importance of tourism. 'Until recently, it had existed -
made a contribution - but it was rather left to look after itself. I think
the government will play a more important role in terms of resources and
improving the product, says Mr Walden.
Tourism is Guernsey's second-largest industry - sandwiched between finance
and horticulture - producing Pounds 110m a year; 18 per cent of the gross
national product. The Tourist Board is aiming for an annual 5 per cent
increase over the next five years to find 100,000 more visitors by 1996, and
bring the number back to the 460,000 who visited in 1989.
The board also plans to increase the number of beds available from 9,600 to
12,000. More than 1,000 were lost when the owners of guest houses and
self-catering establishments, depressed in the past few years with the
downturn in the tourist market, sold their premises.
This year, 70 per cent of Guernsey's hotels have reduced their rates, held
them at the 1992 level, or made only a cost-of-living increase.
With a budget of Pounds 2.3m - a 3 per cent increase this year - Mr Walden
plans to get closer to the consumer with road shows and promotions in
Britain. He hopes to engage people to represent Guernsey on the ground in
mainland Europe and do more to encourage conference visitors and small
hotels to upgrade their facilities.
'One of our problems,' he says 'has been that until 1990 the tourist
industry here thought that the UK would supply all its needs. It didn't want
to pay commission on European sales, so looked to UK visitors who booked
direct. This meant that continental (European) tour operators couldn't
obtain the allocation of rooms they needed to put their brochures together.
'I think local industry must now come to terms with the fact that the
continental visitor may be more important in terms of length of stay and
spending power. We have so much potential but we still look north because
it's been traditional, it's English speaking and easier to operate.'
Who goes to Guernsey for a holiday? According to Mr Evan Ozanne, marketing
director: 'Mainly those in the 45 to 55-plus age range who come to enjoy our
way of life, the peace and quiet, bird watching, fishing, walking, flowers
on the cliffs, trips to other islands, super food and a society that
welcomes them. We're not creating anything for tourists - we call them
visitors - just making available what is here.'
He feels there should certainly be more French connections. 'It seems
remarkable we are not attracting more people from just across the water.
This year we're spending Pounds 50,000 on advertising there and attending
exhibitions for the first time.'
Research has shown that many who visit Guernsey from mainland Europe prefer
to stay in small hotels providing good en suite facilities, good food and
personal service.
The eight-bedroom Midhurst House Hotel in St Peter Port has been run for 14
years by Brian and Jan Goodenough and this year they, too, looked to Europe
for visitors. But they found that all the cheaper flights in July and
August, at Pounds 272 from Dusseldorf for example, had been taken by tour
operators, leaving only Pounds 400 seats available for independent
travellers.
The Goodenoughs, who lost a booking because of this, feel there is little
point advertising in Germany if guests cannot get to them.
Mr Walden sympathised. 'We want to encourage more Midhursts,' he said, 'and
I think we should, perhaps, intervene with the airlines on something like
this.'
Visitors' biggest concerns, according to harbour and airport surveys, are
cars, lack of parking facilities and signposts. 'There's been no effort to
restrict car numbers,' Mr Walden admitted. 'No MOT, no VAT and petrol and
hire car prices are the lowest in Europe. We have the strange situation that
although people want to bring their cars, they complain there are too many
when they come.'
A Guernsey man who is also concerned about the lack of parking as well as
the state of St Peter Port's unique attraction, the Victorian market
building, is Mr Gerry Cobb. Frustrated with the finance industry, he now has
a fish stand in the market. But shoppers are unable to park nearby, he says,
and therefore they are drawn to an out-of-town supermarket. This fact,
together with a lack of spending on the market building itself, makes him
fearful for its future.
'If it's not properly maintained, we'll be in grave danger of the town
losing its soul and its heart as well,' he said.
There is certainly no lack of commitment in Guernsey's conference and
incentive fields, although Mr Tim Orton, conference manager, says the past
few years have been very tough with the number of conference delegates
falling from 10,000 in the 1980s to 4,100 in 1992. Together with
island-based agencies, Mr Orton is now going out to persuade companies that
Guernsey - 'abroad but not foreign' - with departures from 21 UK airports,
is a perfect business environment.
At least 15 hotels provide conference facilities for up to 200 delegates.
Mr Tom Castledine, managing director of the five-crown St Pierre Park, feels
there is room for cautious optimism. 'Companies are booking very late,
sometimes only a month in advance,' he said. 'But the first six months of
this year will certainly be better than last.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (14): From mainstay to minor industry -
The decline and fall of the tomato does not mean, however, that horticulture
has disappeared from Guernsey altogether / Horticulture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

DRIVING around Guernsey, it seems as if there are more derelict glasshouses
than any other kind of building. With their peeling white paintwork, smashed
windows and weeds growing all around, they are testimony to a horticultural
industry which flourished for a while then went into steep decline.
As recently as the 1960s, horticulture was the mainstay of the Guernsey
economy. In 1973, horticulture accounted for 36 per cent of the Bailiwick's
gross national product. Today, it accounts for 5 per cent of the export
sectors of the economy and just over 6 per cent of gross national product.
Dessert grapes were the first leading crop to be grown. The first exports,
to the mainland, were recorded as 3,474lb in 1830. This increased to 2,541
tons in 1915, only to decline from 1920 as competitors in other countries
emerged with lower prices.
The extensive grape growing in earlier times is the reason why holdings on
the islands are always called vineries even though most of them have long
since ceased to grow grapes.
By the 1960s, tomatoes were the largest export crop and 1,000 acres were
devoted to tomato cultivation.
Mr Peter Falla, development quality control officer at the Horticulture
Advisory Service (HAS), reckons that in the late 1960s about 10m trays
weighing 12lb each - and worth a total of about Pounds 32m in those days -
were being exported. At today's current values that would mean exports of
Pounds 150m.
In 1991, however, tomato exports including sundry other fruit and vegetables
were worth just Pounds 5.4m and tomatoes by volume amounted to just 750,000
boxes. Less than 200 acres is used for growing tomatoes.
What went wrong? In the 1970s foreign competitors, particularly the Dutch,
subsidised their industries with cheap energy. The Dutch used cheap North
Sea gas to help their growers. This was at a time when oil prices rocketed.
Guernsey is dependent on imported oil. With the oil price rises of the 1970s
came high interest rates.
Anyone who had borrowed to invest and expand was caught in a vice of sharply
rising costs and falling prices as the Dutch and others flooded Guernsey's
main market, the UK mainland. Many went out of business.
The decline and fall of the tomato, however, does not mean that horticulture
has disappeared from Guernsey altogether.
There was a short-lived kiwi fruit industry in the 1980s which faded because
of cheap competition. And tomatoes are still grown, albeit on a smaller
scale and usually on large (for Guernsey) holdings with high-technology
production.
Mr Graham Greene at the Sandpiper Nursery owns 8 acres and grows mostly
tomatoes on 5 acres. He was making money until a year ago when prices
suddenly dropped by 25 per cent and he went into loss. He has not been
helped by debts of nearly Pounds 400,000.
Mr Greene says: 'You have to make the investment. You need to put in metal
glass instead of wood glass to contain heat loss. Everything is
computer-controlled, from the feed, to the water, to the lighting. In this
way you can keep costs, particularly labour costs, under control and
increase productivity.'
Mr Greene believes there will continue to be a horticulture industry. He
sees consolidation and size, whether it is in tomatoes or flowers, as the
way forward. At the moment there are 600 growers in Guernsey and an average
holding of about half an acre.
Mr John Ogier, an advisory assistant at the HAS, agrees that horticulture
will continue to be an important minor industry. He says: 'Okay, the
industry has contracted. But it still accounts for over 6 per cent of GNP
and about 10 per cent of employment. In England, agriculture accounts for
less than 2 per cent of GNP and employs hardly anyone.'
The main emphasis of the reduced industry is on cut flowers. Guernsey has
about 10 per cent of the total cut flower market and 90 per cent of
freesias.
In all, the horticulture industry exports Pounds 33.7m by value. Freesias
amount to Pounds 8.1m, with roses coming a close second at Pounds 7.6m.
A further Pounds 14m in the island's economy can be directly linked to
horticulture through Guernsey companies in products, transport, glasshouse
building, fuel supply, analysis and advice. Besides the growers there are a
further 1,800 people employed in the industry with 200 in associated
industries.
Mr Peter Falla says: 'We do not accept that the industry is bound to decline
further. The per capita purchase of cut flowers in Britain is only about 40
per cent of some European countries. We sell only through wholesalers at the
moment, so there is scope for adding value to the product through dealing
directly with retailers.'
He does not think that consolidation into bigger units is inevitable. He
says: 'The investment needed now is great and this militates against the
small growers. But through co-operatives and better marketing there is a lot
that can be done.'
There is a small agriculture sector on the island, with a herd of 2,500
protected Guernsey cows on 65 farms. They are used mainly to keep the island
self sufficient in dairy products.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (13): Importance is likely to grow -
Despite some painful rows with banks and other businesses, the head of the
Financial Services Commission has earned a grudging respect from most of the
institutions / Profile: John Roper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUERNSEY may only be a few miles from the French coastline, but its
regulatory system leans very heavily towards Britain. The man most
responsible for that tilt is Mr John Roper, head of the Financial Services
Commission.
In the past eight years, Roper has built the FSC from its first days as a
body independent of government. He inherited from his predecessor an
organisation with a single assistant, a secretary and limited activities.
He has shaped it into an agency with 20 staff, busy on new legislation and
with tentacles stretching across the island's most important business
sector.
He has unusual views for someone in charge of supervision, however. 'The
ideal regulation is no regulation at all,' he says. 'We've gone way past
that. But we live in a world where regulation is flavour of the month. It
would look bad if we didn't have good laws and regulations, even if people
were well-behaved.
'We should not undermine individuals' own independent judgment, so they
believe what was a jungle has been turned into a park and it doesn't matter
what bench they sit on,' he says. 'All benches should always be looked at.'
Roper is an imposing man with blunt views, who is given to wry turns of
phrase.
His importance is only likely to grow as Guernsey continues to shed what he
calls 'the emotional attachment to the tomato', and turns more than ever to
financial services as the mainstay of the economy.
In spite of some painful rows with banks and other businesses behind the
scenes, he seems to have earned at the very least a grudging respect from
most of the institutions under his eye.
The key, he believes, is to 'talk the hind legs off the banks' with his
views then wait for them to make these same proposals for change to the FSC
and politicians in the belief that they are their own ideas.
He stresses that Guernsey never set out to become an offshore centre,
purposely setting low tax rates and devising favourable business structures
to attract investment. But he concedes that things have changed. 'We were
not an artificial offshore centre,' he says. 'But we have become a little
artificial with competition.'
What he says he is keen to avoid is the prospect of a US judge hearing a
court case and frowning when Guernsey is mentioned as 'one of those places'
 -some form of shady tax haven.
He has sent a clear message recently that asset protection trusts should not
be encouraged on the island, for example. Aside from the new insurance and
banking laws, he is also looking at future legislation on fiduciaries -
something which Britain appears to have abandoned as too complex, but which
is being discussed in Jersey.
Mr Roper was born in Spain and in 1936 his family fled to England where they
moved between a succession of boarding houses. 'We were a typical middle
class family without the money,' he says. Despite the unfamiliar culture and
the restlessness, he managed to gain a place at Oxford University in the mid
1950s, where he studied politics, philosophy and economics.
But he says he still harboured a sense of insecurity. That, he believes,
helped put him and keep him at the Bank of England for most of his working
career. The Bank acted 'like a womb' for him as he rose to eventually become
senior manager for banking supervision.
On arrival in Guernsey, he rapidly hired two other senior regulators to join
him at the FSC. His attachment to the Bank shows in the approach he believes
has been adopted by his agency.
'What I offer is reasonable regulation, very much in the British style, that
concentrates on understanding business and adapting to its circumstances,
rather than knowing our own rules and reciting them like a parrot,' he says.
It's a tremendous tightrope; we want to be flexible and even-handed.
Mr Roper's first significant contact with Guernsey came in the 1970s when he
was involved at the Bank in dealing with Barnett Christie, the local
institution involved in imprudent loans, which remains one of the island's
few public financial embarrassments.
When the newly-created FSC went to the Bank looking for a candidate to take
one of the two top jobs in 1986, he applied, in part because he was so
frustrated with commuting.
Initially he went on secondment, careful to sample the waters before making
too big a commitment. Now he is longing to sell his London house and sever
the final ties with the mainland. Like many of his transplanted colleagues,
he talks constantly about 'us' and 'we' when referring to Guernsey.
Looking forward, Mr Roper says he plans to stay in office until March 1997.
But any of his enemies hoping he might then seek a quiet retirement will be
disappointed. He hopes to stand for election, not focused on purely local
issues, but as what he calls a 'national politician'.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (12): Main centre for the Channel Islands
 -There are about 3,000 moorings for yachts around the island. Size is no
object  / Yachting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 15,000 yachts visit Guernsey each year. The money spent by the
visitors makes a significant contribution to the island's tourism income.
There are three marinas - the Victoria, the Albert and the Queen Elizabeth
II - tucked inside the 100-acre St Peter Port harbour complex.
The Victoria dates back to the eleventh century and is now used largely for
visiting craft. In the 1850s, a vast expansion took place which meant the
old four-acre harbour was increased to 70 acres. Two great breakwaters were
started. The southern one linked the shore with Castle Cornet, ending its
long history as an island.
The 'pool' created by the breakwaters has been developed over the years for
containers, ro-ro traffic, passenger ferries and the fishing fleet. A second
marina, the Albert Marina, was developed next to the Victoria.
Finally, in 1985, work was started on what was known as the North Beach
project. Costing Pounds 15m this involved claiming 30 acres of foreshore
next to the harbour to provide a marina, harbour facilities and parking for
freight vehicles. The Queen Elizabeth II Marina was officially opened in
1989 and can accommodate 800 yachts.
St Sampson's harbour, close to St Peter Port, handles private boats, fuel
tankers and timber-carrying vessels. It has an active ship repair industry.
It does not have a yachting marina as such.
Further north, the private Beaucette Marina, constructed from a disused
quarry, has all-year-round facilities for vessels as well as visiting
yachts.
In all, there are about 3,000 moorings for yachts around the island. Size is
no object. There is a heavy tidal drop of 9m between high and low tide. In
the 'pool' and two of the marinas there is a draught of 6m. The moorings can
accommodate yachts of up to 100m comfortably.
Captain Timothy Spencer, States Harbour Master, says: 'Yachts can get into
the marinas at most states of the tide, certainly more than 70 per cent of
each day.'
Of the 3,000 or so moorings, more than 2,000 are taken up by locally-owned
craft. It is the visiting craft which really contribute to the tourism
economy.
There are as many as 500 yachts visiting each day in high summer. The
Victoria marina can take nearly 300 boats. The rest moor either in the pool
or in the Queen Elizabeth II marina.
In 1989 the Harbour Board of Administration commissioned a report on
visiting yachts. It found that on average 15,000 yachts visited each year.
There were 4.2 people on each yacht and they spent Pounds 80 a head - a
total tourist 'spend' of Pounds 6m.
Captain Spencer says: 'You would have to increase that figure now. You can
safely say that if the total tourism spend in Guernsey is Pounds 100m, then
visiting yachtsmen account for 10 per cent of it.'
This is certainly a higher contribution than for neighbouring Jersey.
Why has Guernsey become the main yachting centre for the Channel Islands?
One reason is the deep water. Conseiller Roger Berry, president of the
Harbour Board of Administration, says: 'Jersey is generally sandy while
Guernsey is rocky. They (Jersey) built their marina on the south side of the
island and it dries out to a greater extent than the marinas here.'
Captain Spencer says: 'If you look at the map, Guernsey is much more
strategically placed than Jersey. Jersey is tucked into the French coast.
You are almost in France when you get to Jersey. Guernsey is the most
convenient landfall between Britain and Spain and the Mediterranean.'
Conseiller Perry adds: 'It takes up to 12 hours to reach here from the
Solent. By the time the crews have moored and tied up they are ready to go
out and spend money on a good meal.'
Whatever the reason, Guernsey has developed a niche tourism market in
yachting. Captain Spencer sees this business increasing further.
He says: 'We are getting events like the Swan Regatta. In September we have
the Guernsey International Powerboat week. This features the British
powerboat grand prix. These kind of events extend our season.'
But whether Guernsey will develop into a great international yachting centre
along the lines of some of the Mediterranean resorts is highly debatable.
A tentative proposal by Amec Civil Engineering to reclaim and develop a
swathe of Bell Greve bay, which is between St Peter Port and St Sampson's
harbour, has run into stiff opposition.
Amec says that its plan to reclaim 150 acres of foreshore at a cost of
Pounds 70m is consistent with the island's strategic and corporate plan.
To make the project financially viable the Amec plan would include new
marina facilities, housing areas, a hotel and golf course.
The islanders staged a protest march earlier this month which led the the
Advisory and Finance Committee to the States publicly to say that elements
of the onshore development are probably 'unacceptable'.
Amec, however, will persevere with its ideas.
Ms Julia Bircher, spokeswoman for Amec, says: 'We are going the exhibition
route. We are in close consultation with the authorities and we are going to
set up a model to show that the proposals are environmentally safe and
friendly.'
Conseiller Roger Berry says that, in his view, the proposals are politically
impossible - but that everything is at a very early stage.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (11): A problem with typecasting - What
does not come readily to mind is Guernsey as a base for manufacturing and
this has been a problem in attracting new enterprises / Manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS

<TEXT>
ONE of Guernsey's problems is that it tends to get typecast. People used to
think of cows, flowers and holidays; nowadays it might be financial
services. What does not come readily to mind is Guernsey as a base for
manufacturing industry and this has been a problem in attracting new
enterprises.
The island's administration decided in the early 1980s that a small but
strong manufacturing sector would be an invaluable asset and should be
encouraged in order to extend the range of available jobs beyond financial
services, horticulture and tourism.
A number of small businesses were set up and flourished at a time of high
economic growth, with exports peaking in the middle of the decade at about
Pounds 70m a year.
However, with the onset of the recession, exports have now fallen to Pounds
30m and the manufacturing sector contributes about 6 per cent of exports
compared with 15 per cent at the peak.
The authorities now accept that with little available development land, a
limited labour pool and the disadvantages associated with the high costs of
transport, it is difficult for Guernsey to become a significant location for
light industry.
The latest strategic and corporate plan states: 'It would be unrealistic to
assume that this economic sector will show any increased contribution
towards the island's gross national product in the next five years.'
The States (the local parliament), had reserved land for light industrial
use but has decided that as the need to provide more housing is more urgent,
some land earmarked for industry will now be developed primarily for
residential purposes.
Nevertheless, manufacturing industry continues to provide a valuable
broadening of the limited economic base, and currently employs about 2,000
people. The sector includes electronics, engineering, printing,
pharmaceuticals, plastics, textiles, crafts and boat building, with an
overwhelming predominance of very small companies.
By far the largest group of companies is in electronics, which maintained
exports at about Pounds 15m over each of the past three years, down from a
peak of Pounds 68m in the mid-1980s. Companies on the island include
Dynatech Data Communications, Offshore Electronics and Datalink
International which produces multi-currency integrated software systems for
the offshore finance industry.
Pharmaceuticals is another appropriate industry for Guernsey because the
products are high value and easily transportable. Printing, which employs
500, supports the local finance and manufacturing industries by producing
packaging, brochures and advertising material, and the sector exports Pounds
3m worth of goods a year.
Boat building and repairs are a natural industry for the island and the
sector is beginning to recover from the setback of the recession. Two of the
biggest companies are Seaward Marine which builds pilot vessels, launches
and motor yachts, and Aqua-Star, builders of pleasure craft and fishing
boats in fibreglass.
Local craft industries such as silversmiths, coppersmiths, jewellers,
knitwear manufacturers and furniture makers - aimed largely at the tourist -
have also suffered badly from the UK recession, but there are signs of
improvement.
One of the aims of the island's Board of Industry, responsible for promoting
and developing industry and commerce, is to encourage small companies to
develop niche markets rather than attempt to compete in mainstream
industries.
This has been successful in limited areas and there are now market leaders
in medical diagnostic equipment, disposable respiratory equipment, software
for the finance industry and sonar technology.
Marine Electronics, which specialises in the design and manufacture of
underwater acoustic sonars and telemetry systems used in the offshore oil
industry, is typical. It was set up on the island 10 years ago and has
become a market leader with its transponders and telemetry innovations. The
equipment is used for commercial offshore operations as well as naval
applications for the Ministry of Defence.
A range of scanning sonar systems which operate like short-range radar is
exported worldwide but operated mainly in North Sea oil exploration and
maintenance. Design and final assembly is done in premises on a small
industrial estate.
Mr Brian Evans, managing director, says: 'The recession hit us over the last
two years, but the amount of work is now going right up and we are
advertising for more staff. There are definite signs of recovery.'
Another niche company which sends 80 per cent of its goods and services
outside the Channel Islands and the UK is Vapormatt, which specialises in
surface finishing equipment and abrasives, and employs 45 people.
Mr Robin Ashworth, one of three Guernsey brothers who run the company, sees
no problem in operating worldwide from a small offshore island with a
limited industrial base.
'The quality of the workforce is good, and the infrastructure is excellent
because of the needs of the financial services and tourism industries,' he
says.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (10): Small shops and a unique flavour -
The main shopping area is a narrow, cobbled street, a pleasure to stroll in
/ Shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH

<TEXT>
ST Peter Port has the most beautiful harbour view in Europe, said Victor
Hugo who lived in Guernsey for 15 years. Just over 100 years later, it has
hardly changed.
Tucked away on the hill just behind the harbour itself is the town's main
shopping area, a narrow, cobbled high street, closed to all but commercial
traffic - and a pleasure to stroll in.
It has a variety of small shops, often run by the families who started them
more than a century ago, one department store, and a smattering of UK high
street names such as Marks and Spencer, Woolworth, Burton, Etam and Dorothy
Perkins. There are, happily, not enough to destroy the town's unique,
attractive French-British flavour, where small is beautiful.
'It would have been nice if we could have kept a more local flavour,' says
Mr Anthony Creasey whose great-grandfather founded Creasey's, the only
department store of any size with a Marks and Spencer franchise operating
within it. 'But being something of a realist, the present development is
almost inevitable. It's up to local traders like ourselves to try and remain
strong and healthy and keep the local flavour going.'
Mr Robert Baker, chairman of the St Peter Port Traders Association, thinks
it is this mix of independents working alongside main retailers that makes
Guernsey unique.
'In the UK, one town is like another,' he said, 'but here the customer has a
very good choice. In fact, we have more retail foot of space per head of
population than most of Europe.'
In summer, the shopping area in St Peter Port is alive with buskers and
flowers, he says, and with the French influence it has a lovely atmosphere.
It is pleasantly compact. Clustered around the high street are the jewellery
and up-market clothes shops of the Pollet and Commercial Arcade; there are
book shops in Smith Street; pubs, picture galleries, boutiques and antique
shops in the Old Quarter; and a magnificent covered Victorian market selling
mainly fruit, vegetables, fish, wine and dairy produce.
What are the best buys? There's no VAT, but this does not mean shop prices
are always 17.5 per cent less than UK mainland prices. With the addition of
freight and other hidden expenses such as telephone charges, goods are not
always as cheap as one thinks they might be.
But there's no doubt there can be savings on specific items: perfume,
especially if it comes from France (Chanel can be found 20 per cent cheaper,
Dior 40 per cent); cosmetics; shoes; jewellery, silver, watches (34 per cent
less at one shop), some photographic equipment, some electronic goods, the
more expensive spirits and liqueurs. A litre bottle of malt whiskey was
priced at Pounds 16.80; Glenfiddich Pounds 21.25; and Remy Martin VSOP
Pounds 31.80. There are price savings of 10-15 per cent on Jaeger and Alexon
clothes.
At Bucktrout's - a company established in 1830 and specialising today in
malts, ports, cognacs, wines and spirits, tobaccos and cigars - loose
tobacco (Black Cherry and Pirates Punch are the favourites) was selling at
Pounds 3.42p for 2 oz, cigarettes at Pounds 1.58 for 20. A box of best
Corona cigars was on sale for Pounds 84.
Many craftsmen sell their work from their premises around the island. Mr
Bruce Russell, a gold and silversmith, gives daily demonstrations of his
work in a 16th century barn and has a large range of hand-made 9 carat and
18 carat gold jewellery.
You can see potters at work at the Moulin Huet Pottery on the south coast,
and potters, glassblowers and engravers, patchworkers and a silversmith at
the Oatlands Craft Centre in St Sampson's.
Other craftsmen from whom you can buy direct include a copper and tin smith,
clockmakers, a woodcarver, a doll's clothes manufacturer and toy makers. At
Le Tricoteur, you can see how the island's most famous product, the
guernsey, is produced.
Because Guernsey is only affiliated to, and not a full member of, the
European Community, visitors need to check Customs regulations on the value
of gifts and quantity of cigarettes, tobacco, perfumes and alcoholic drinks
that can be brought back to the UK without incurring extra duty and taxes.
Perhaps what visitors like most about shopping in Guernsey - apart from the
absence of VAT - is the personal and friendly service they find.
'Shopkeepers take a great interest in what they're selling you,' said
Marguerite Froissard who runs Island Holidays, a Guernsey-based tour company
specialising in Guernsey. 'You can walk in, get things on approval, take
them away and bring them back and change them. It's all done on a very
friendly basis. There are wonderful perfume and make-up shops and we're
lucky because many French perfumes are put on trial here before they go on
general release.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (9): Housing controls prevent an influx -
Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attractions of Guernsey as a place to live and work, with its regulatory
independence, low tax rates and a pleasant climate, have led to strict
controls over the island's housing market to prevent mass immigration from
the UK.
It became clear soon after the Second World War that without some form of
control over the occupation of residential properties, prices would escalate
out of reach of the local population.
In 1948 the States, or local legislature, foresaw future problems and
introduced a housing control law in a relatively mild form.
This has since been amended and strengthened many times and it is now
regarded as a highly effective barrier against an influx of outsiders.
The island's 18,000 homes have been divided into two categories, with 90 per
cent available for occupancy only by the local population - broadly those
born in Guernsey or with Guernsey parents - and the remaining 10 per cent
designated as 'open market' housing which anyone can buy and occupy.
The only exceptions are those outsiders granted a housing licence by the
local authority to occupy local homes, but these are given infrequently and
generally only to people with job skills and qualifications that cannot be
provided locally.
Open-market housing, which was originally chosen because of its relatively
high rateable value, is generally the larger executive type of house, and
the number is fixed.
No transfer into the open market category is allowed, and no new building
plots are available.
In such a restricted market and given the pressures that have followed the
influx of highly paid executives in the financial services sector, prices
have stayed high.
According to Mr John Allen, managing director of Swoffers, a local estate
agents, open-market prices climbed to 'dizzy heights' prior to the
recession, with Pounds 2m the highest price achieved. But since the end of
1990, prices have retreated by about 25 per cent as potential buyers from
the UK have had difficulties selling their homes and businesses.
The base level for a modest open-market semi-detached house has fallen from
Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 175,000 or even Pounds 150,000, and an old
farmhouse in 10 acres and in good condition would now fetch between Pounds
650,000 and Pounds 800,000.
Prices have also fallen on the local market as the recession has taken
effect, but not nearly to the same extent. 'They have been bumping along
rather than falling sharply,' says Mr Allen.
In general, open-market houses fetch between two and three times their local
equivalent, where the asking prices are around Pounds 90,000 to Pounds
100,000 for an average three-bedroom semi and Pounds 60,000 for a base-level
two-bedroom terrace house.
There are now probably between 150 and 200 open-market houses up for sale -
a relatively high number given that there were only 60 transactions
completed in each of the past two years, compared with 120 in 1989.
One problem has been that owners are reluctant to cut prices that still hark
back to the levels of two years ago.
Mr Ben Lovell, of Lovell &amp; Partners in St Peter Port, believes the local
market has begun to improve significantly, and is much more buoyant than
just six months ago. 'We are lucky. When the recession hits the UK, it
affects us later and not so sharply.'
However, he accepts that neither the open nor the local market will recover
fully until the UK housing and business sectors improve substantially.
Mr Lovell believes Guernsey's unique system works well. 'It is very
straightforward and uncomplicated.'
Because the restricted supply keeps open-market values high, the signs of a
relatively good value local market might tempt incomers to dodge the island
rules. In practice, tighter employment laws would exclude such buyers from
the jobs market.
In addition, the island is too small a community to try bending the
regulations, especially as the completion of any property transaction has to
take place in the royal court in front of the bailiff. It is a public
transaction, rather than a discreet transfer of deeds.
Relatively few licences are granted for outsiders to buy local properties,
but there is growing pressure on the housing authority to be more liberal in
its judgments, particularly over short-term licences for key personnel in
the hotel and restaurant sector.
More homes are planned for locals, almost entirely in carefully designated
built-up zones, in order to prevent more building in rural areas.
Alderney and Sark do not have housing controls but property can be scarce
and expensive. Alderney operates a work permit system, but it is very
flexible and insists simply that incomers have no criminal record.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (8): Fabulous wealth 'not essential' -
Because Guernsey is a small place with not a lot of cultural amenities, many
rentiers feel a need to leave the island from time to time / Profile: John
Schute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WITH a mane of grey hair and a neat, six-button blue blazer, Mr John Schute
looks every inch the archetypal expatriate who could be found in any number
of outposts around the world over which the Union Jack once flew.
One of the first things he is at pains to point out, however, is that he is
not an average rentier. 'I would say I am an atypical rentier. I attend all
the debates in the States (parliament). I am very involved in local issues.
Also, I am not rich.'
After some thought, he adds: 'Actually, it is probably a bit misleading to
say I am atypical because I do not think there is such a thing as a typical
rentier on Guernsey. On Jersey, yes, there is an identifiable set. It is a
bit flashier over there.'
Mr Schute, 55, came to Guernsey by way of Jersey. A former Fleet Street news
photographer and representative for the Magnum photographic agency, he left
Fleet Street to join his British parents who were living in Portugal. There
he became involved in property development.
When his father died, he and his mother wanted to settle elsewhere. They
moved to Jersey in 1968. After a year, they moved to Guernsey and bought a
Georgian-style house where he still lives.
He says: 'You do not have to be fabulously wealthy to live on Guernsey. My
house was bought for Pounds 12,000.' He now estimates that it is worth
Pounds 700,000-Pounds 800,000. It his main asset.
He says he has a little bit of investment income. He still takes photographs
for various publications and he is an accomplished painter of water colours.
He sells paintings from time to time.
His companion of 20 years, Jennifer, has a good job in management at one of
the banks.
'A lot of people who you would class as rentiers are in a similar position
to us; some assets but also a regular salary coming in', he says.
He adds that there obviously are some very wealthy people on the island, but
says: 'You would be hard put to say who they were if you did not know
beforehand. There are few obvious trappings of wealth. You will not see many
Rolls-Royce motor cars.'
Mr Schute says there are a 'remarkable number' of clubs covering everything
from yachting, to tennis to bridge. But he adds: 'There is not a central
colonial-style club or watering hole where expatriates exclusively
foregather. Everything is very integrated on the island.'
One of Guernsey's continuing attractions, as far as he is concerned, is the
high level of services. 'There are very good doctors, dentists and
hospitals. Everything works here.'
He has one small quibble about the settler life. Guernsey is a small place
with not a lot of cultural amenities and he, like other rentiers, does feel
a need to leave the island from time to time. He says: 'Jennifer misses
London. We go there about every two months. You can be in London in two
hours and it is not too expensive.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (7): An important role in the economy -
Rentiers from outside appear to be well integrated with the local people /
Rentiers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY

<TEXT>
GUERNSEY, like Jersey, has a 'rentier' sector which is important to its
economy. Rentiers - residents whose main income is derived from investments
 -contribute 20 per cent of Guernsey's gross national product. Outsiders
wishing to settle in Guernsey form part of the rentier group but not all of
it.
Unlike Jersey, Guernsey does not have a limit on the number of people who
can settle in the Bailiwick. In Guernsey, anyone can occupy an open-market
property provided they can afford the price. In practice, the inflow is
regulated by the island's complex two-tier housing system.
The Bailiwick has a local market for people who were either born in
Guernsey, or married someone who was born in Guernsey. Exceptions have been
made for professional people such as doctors and dentists who have bought
local-market houses under special licence.
The open market is controlled by a physical limit on the number of houses.
At present there are just under 1,800 houses on the open market. The stock
is not being increased.
Several open-market properties are on the site of the old Fort St George. In
1961, the States (parliament) sold the 54-acre former British army garrison
for development as a wealthy settlers' enclave. Prices on the estate range
from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 3m.
It is thought these price levels preclude anybody who is not at least
comfortably off trying to settle. Because Guernsey is not part of the EC, it
is not subject to the immigration restrictions of the Community. In
practice, more than 90 per cent of the settlers are of British derivation.
As financial services have grown, more licences have been given to people in
this sector to buy local-market houses. Others rent properties. Many of
these people would qualify as rentiers.
Rentiers from outside appear to be well integrated with the local people. Mr
Tony Carey, who retired from the British army as a major and is now involved
in business in his native Guernsey, says: 'There is a great deal of mingling
on Guernsey. If you are invited to a dinner party you would probably find a
wide cross-section of people, from the local policeman to a visiting banker,
to a grower. Guernsey's settlers are much less ostentatious than those on
Jersey.'
There are exceptions. Oliver Reed, the actor, can be found taking a stroll
around St Peter Port, although his appearances are apparently less frequent
than in the recent years.
Broadcaster and former politician Brian Walden is also a rentier. He keeps a
very low profile, rarely gives interviews to the local press and is seldom
seen.
On Sark and Alderney, which are part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the rules
are different again. On Sark, there are very few houses to buy and anyone
wishing to build a new one must first live on the island for 15 years.
On Alderney, technically, anyone can buy a home if he or she can find one.
Ian Botham, the England cricketer has a holiday home on Alderney.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (6): End to recession will bring growth -
Guernsey has advantages for long-term contracts such as a retirement pension
/ Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUERNSEY has been trying to capture a sizeable slice of the market in
off-shore pensions, but although a range of products is now in place,
success has been patchy.
The target market is the expatriate employee or third-country national who
works in a number of countries or who finds it impractical or impossible for
tax reasons to fund a retirement policy in his or her own country.
It is a market which grew rapidly throughout the 1980s and although it has
been badly affected by the world recession it could be set to expand
substantially during the 1990s.
Two broad types of international pensions products are marketed in Guernsey:
international personal pensions or retirement annuities aimed at
individuals; and off-shore pensions targeted at companies to establish for
their employees. Guernsey-based insurance companies tend to specialise in
one or the other.
According to Mr Rodney Benjamin, a Guernsey partner in consulting actuaries
Bacon &amp; Woodrow, some of the schemes could also be of interest to capped
executives in the UK where there is no tax advantage for pensions on
earnings over Pounds 75,000. 'These are now being marketed quite actively
and as the UK claws its way out of recession and the cap bites more deeply,
interest should increase,' he said.
There are certain clear advantages for choosing Guernsey for a long-term
contract such as a retirement pension. According to a recent survey of
clients conducted by the Guernsey branch of Generali, the Trieste-based
international insurance conglomerate, top of the list is political
stability, which has been a big factor in the island's success as a
financial centre.
This is followed by its fiscal independence - Guernsey is responsible for
its own domestic affairs, including taxation, and is not subject to
harmonisation of European Community taxation; excellent communications; and
a sophisticated infrastructure which provides the back-up services of
lawyers, accountants, actuaries and other specialists.
For off-shore insurers, policyholders' funds are free of Guernsey taxation,
thus the income and capital gains accruing on the funds are not taxed and no
tax is imposed when payments are made. Guernsey also has specific
legislation for the establishment of pension fund trusts.
However, despite these inherent advantages, progress has been
disappointingly slow, partly because of a flying start by neighbouring
Jersey which soaked up much of the early business.
Both islands produced similar concepts for expatriate and off-shore pensions
but Jersey was able to put its proposals through much more rapidly because
it does not need Privy Council approval as does Guernsey.
Guernsey's legislation was also part of a package which included local
pensions provisions and this delayed implementation for a year.
Jersey passed its so-called Article 131(C) pension plan legislation in 1990
and Norwich Union, the market leader, and other insurers achieved an early
start. Guernsey's Section 40 (ee) for personal pensions and Section 40 (O)
for organisations did not come into operation until 18 months ago, and
Guernsey-based companies have had problems catching up.
Although broadly similar, there are subtle differences in approach between
the two islands. Both want to ensure they gain revenue benefits from the
products channelled through them, but whereas Jersey has provided that the
pension plans must be sold through a resident insurance broker, Guernsey has
imposed no such requirement.
The difference is largely explained by the fact that Jersey has no life
assurance companies of its own, whereas Guernsey has several including
Providence Capitol International, Sun Alliance International and Nordben,
all incorporated in Guernsey, and Generali and Equitable Life, which are
branch operations.
A branch selling Article 131(C) business in Jersey is exempt from tax,
whereas an operation in Guernsey is liable to tax on its profits but at the
low rate of 20 per cent, and for a non-resident company this can be offset
against tax levied elsewhere. In addition, the income tax authorities have
specifically excluded the sale of Article 131(C) contracts to UK residents,
but Guernsey does not exclude this possibility.
Offshore pension contracts are much more flexible than their onshore
equivalents in aspects such as retirement age, cash commutation, or the form
in which benefits are received in retirement, and they are not constrained
by tax legislation.
Providence Capitol, probably the biggest local insurer with a staff of 75,
has developed a flexible international personal pension plan. Others are
thinking of following.
Mr Mel Carvill, Guernsey branch manager for Generali which specialises in
offshore pensions for multinational companies and for international
organisations such as the United Nations, also emphasises the flexibility
that local plans give, including scope to transfer funds to the UK or
elsewhere to buy an annuity on retirement. 'Our growth in Guernsey has been
significant,' he says.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (5): Leading the field with its captives
 -Guernsey is the largest centre in Europe and one of the biggest in the
world after locations such as Bermuda and the Caymans / Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF there is one category of financial services in which Guernsey has
out-performed its rival offshore centres, it is in the cultivation of
captive insurance companies.
Banks and other institutions have gained a foothold as in many offshore
centres. But few can compete with Guernsey's status on captives, and
certainly not Jersey, its most obvious rival, which only recently offered
rapprochement to insurance companies.
'We had a captive market for captives,' says Mr Bruce Riley, industry
supervisor during the 1970s and early 1980s when much of the growth took
place and who is now managing director of Guinness Flight Fund Managers in
Guernsey.
The total number of captives is now 230 - making Guernsey the largest centre
in Europe and one of the biggest in the world, after locations such as
Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Guernsey had the largest number of net new
captives last year.
Much of the expansion came in the early 1970s. The contraction of the
sterling area left the Channel Islands in a privileged position within the
boundaries, at a time when the insurance market was hardening. As the
reputation built up, new captives arrived.
'It's really taken off in the last 15 years,' says Mr Nick Wild, director
and general manager of International Risk Management, which now manages some
17 captives on the island.
Until 1986, there was no insurance law in Guernsey. That changed with the
impetus given by the creation of the Financial Services Commission and the
appointment of Mr Steve Butterworth as superintendent of insurance.
The legislation did not help the industry. Insurance companies which had
been resident offshore from Guernsey were required to come onshore, partly
so that they could be effectively regulated.
But the effect was also to remove their tax-exempt status, at a time when
the Isle of Man was beginning to be aggressive in courting insurance
business. As a result, the number of new captives remained stable at about
18 a year.
More recent modifications in response mean that insurance companies have the
option of paying no tax, tax on a sliding scale between 0.5 per cent and 30
per cent, or paying 20 per cent. In 1992, the number of new captives rose
correspondingly to 27.
That change in policy reflects the flexibility shown by the authorities in
encouraging offshore business.
The Financial Services Commission plays a dual role, both regulating and
marketing the industry. This is borne out by Mr Butterworth's recent help in
lobbying for Guernsey captives to be included in Pool Re, the reinsurance
pool being designed to underwrite UK terrorist damage.
'If we have a problem, I can call Steve Butterworth and chat it through,'
says Mr Wild. 'With the Department of Trade and Industry you would have to
wait six months for an appointment to speak to somebody.'
He adds that the DTI also requires substantial capitalisation which is
geared far more to third-party insurers than it is to captives.
Accessibility is one reason why captives are tempted to offshore centres
such as Guernsey, Mr Wild says. To the Inland Revenue, companies with
captives are almost inevitably a subject for investigation. 'People don't
understand how captives work,' he says.
He stresses that captives are created for commercial rather than tax reasons
 -although tax rates become important once the decision has been made to
form one.
Guernsey has succeeded, Mr Wild says, because of the infrastructure of
sympathetic regulators, insurance managers and bankers, accountants and
lawyers who understand the industry.
'1992 was a very good year and 1993 is already very good,' he says. 'The
traditional UK insurance market is in disarray and premiums are rising.
'Companies are seeking greater flexibility and are more interested in
forming captives to have better control over their own destiny. They are
dusting off their feasibility studies.'
That is a view shared by Mr Granville de Cruz, managing director of
Sedgwick. 'We continue to see growth,' he says.
Regulation of captives appears to be low-key. Mr Butterworth reflects the
FSC's line of keeping out undesirable companies in the first place. One
company is currently under investigation, while he rejected six captives
last year.
Mr Butterworth is more active in other areas. He is drafting a new insurance
law. He wants new powers, including the ability to freeze assets.
For dealing with a wide variety of everyday complaints from the public, he
would like to see the creation of a financial services ombudsman.
And to deal with the sale of offshore insurance products, he is considering
a regulatory system that would require Guernsey insurers to supervise their
intermediaries and de-license any which fail to perform satisfactorily.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (4): Crucial role in the local economy -
At the latest count, 76 institutions held funds on deposit totalling Pounds
27bn, / Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM a distance, St Julian's Avenue in St Peter Port, Guernsey, looks like a
main road near the centre of any British town. Close up, there is one vital
difference which highlights the crucial role of banking to the local
economy.
It is the names above the entrances of the modern offices gleaming with
brass nameplates. Almost without interruption, there are signs for Baring
Brothers, Bermuda House, NM Rothschild, Hambro House, Hamilton House and
Lazard House. In between are scattered a few accountants and law firms.
Five minutes' walk away, on the other side of the town, is an even more
recent and potent symbol of the astonishing concentration of banks on the
island. On the harbour front are the newly-completed, low-rise,
granite-faced offices of Credit Suisse, rumoured to have cost Pounds 10m.
Mr Roland Hurni-Gosman, the bank's managing director, has great confidence
in future business from Guernsey. Privately, he has said he intends to take
25 per cent of market share. Publicly, he says he plans to increase his 170
staff by a further 40 in the next five years, while computerisation will
increase productivity still further in the same period.
The growth of banking on Guernsey is staggering. Aside from the high street
clearers, the first banks arrived in the early 1960s, with Kleinworts, then
Rothschild and Hambros. At the latest count, there were 76 institutions
holding funds on deposit totalling some Pounds 27bn. The largest number from
a single country was the UK, but that is now just half of the total, with
many from the rest of Europe and others from across the world. There are
nine from Switzerland alone.
The recession has certainly had an impact. Several banks have left in the
past two years.
'The finance sector has not had the greatest time,' says Mr Hurni-Gosman.
'People have become more cost conscious. But we have gone one way, and
that's up.'
The same message comes from Mr Tim Betley, managing director of the Royal
Bank of Canada. 'Business is flowing in,' he says. 'One of the beauties of
this business is that the offshore game survives on uncertainties.'
The Guernsey authorities have been keen to avoid permitting the creation of
pure 'brassplate' or 'cubicle' banks which have no meaningful presence in
Guernsey. But in the past two years they have actively encouraged the
formation of 'managed' or 'administered' banks.
Bank of Bermuda, Canadian Bank of Commerce and Credit Suisse are among those
which manage a presence of other banks on their behalf. Staff will answer
one set of phones in the name of their own bank and a second set in the name
of the managed bank. Some do all the work on behalf of the managed bank.
Others have a skeleton staff, while leaving the main Guernsey bank to carry
out backroom operations.
That provides a base allowing new banks a chance to sample the prospect of
operating on the islands with low overheads and less risk while they
experiment. More important from the perspective of the authorities, managed
banks provide Guernsey with extra business and additional tax revenues
without putting additional strain on the local workforce.
Regulation in Guernsey is very much in the tradition of the Bank of England,
with an emphasis on flexibility and frequent contact. The island has been
able to focus on the top end of the market and exclude other banks which it
does not like. 'We are careful who we let in,' says Mr Peter Crook, the
banking supervisor. 'New banks have got to improve our reputation.'
He says he only accepts those which are well capitalised, highly profitable
and with an international parent in the top 500 banks worldwide. He is
looking for banks which are safe, produce revenues for the island and do not
place strains on the workforce. 'We expect them to make a profit of at least
Pounds 500,000 within three years,' says Mr Crook. 'We want the maximum
profits with the minimum number of people.'
Others - which Mr Crook estimates at about six to eight a year - are
politely told that it would not be worth their while making a formal
application to operate on the island. Fear of negative publicity has so far
prevented any from pursuing their claims for admission through the courts.
Regulators are particularly proud of one bank that failed to gain entry  -
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which applied to open a
branch in the late 1970s. Officials turned it away as a result of knowledge
of its reputation, and lack of information on both its ownership and its
control through holding companies in the Caymans and Luxembourg.
Regulation has tightened over the years. Since the closure of Barnett
Christie in the late 1970s, the Commission has not permitted any indigenous
banks to operate in Guernsey. The only one which does not have a separate
parent is Hanson bank, backed by Lord Hanson's business empire. Tougher
capital adequacy requirements were introduced in the mid 1980s.
As a result, Mr John Roper, head of the Commission, says fresh rules - such
as a new banking law currently being discussed - are more a response to the
need to appear well-regulated than any inherent need for improvements.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (3): Pay-as-you-please system even suits
the tax authorities - Guernsey's flexibility over taxation is one reason for
the substantial growth of banks, investment managers and other enterprises
associated with offshore capital flows. Surprisingly, enthusiasm for
flexible and low taxes comes from tax officials as well as contributors /

THEY have a rather unusual variant in Guernsey of Britain's pay-as-you-earn
tax system, which helps explain the island's role as a substantial financial
centre. It could be called pay-as-you-please.
Most jurisdictions set tax rates and expect taxpayers to comply. The
authorities on Guernsey prefer to negotiate. In the latest and most blatant
example, the new international company regulations being introduced this
year allow businesses to choose to pay virtually any rate they want, from
less than 1 per cent up to 30 per cent.
That flexibility - which is only a codification of informal arrangements
practised over many years - is one reason for the substantial growth of
banks, investment managers and other enterprises associated with offshore
capital flows since the late 1960s.
Guernsey now derives more than half its tax revenue and 54 per cent of its
gross national product from the financial sector - up from a tenth in the
early 1970s. Finance is also now the largest provider of employment -
accounting for more than 15 per cent of the working population, according to
the 1991 census.
Many jobs and profits which do not relate directly to money management are
spin-offs from it. That includes most of the leading accountancy firms, many
law practices and even a firm of actuaries, not to mention the brass plaque
engravers and rubber stamp manufacturers.
Just as important, many of those travelling to the island, staying in its
hotels and dining in its restaurants come for short business trips: nearly
one-sixth of the 330,000 or so visitors last year.
Speak to companies with a presence on the island and most will make strong
approving noises about the benefits of being there - not least the low tax
rates, which even for resident local companies are just 20 per cent, the
same as for individuals. Similar words issue forth from many politicians and
civil servants.
What is more surprising is that the same enthusiasm for flexible and low
taxes also comes from tax officials. Suitably enough, the States of Guernsey
income tax office is hidden down an obscure alley and the sign marking its
presence above the entrance is faded almost beyond recognition.
From his room on the fourth floor, Mr Ken Forman, the administrator of
taxes, makes no apologies for his approach and admits he has a dual role:
part collector, part salesman. 'Our policy has to be flexible,' he says. 'It
is a price we have to pay. We want a slice of the cake. Otherwise money
would be lost to another territory.'
The same tension between regulation and marketing exists for officials at
the Financial Services Commission. The FSC was created in the mid 1980s to
be independent of government. Its chairman is the elected president of the
island's finance and advisory committee. But its four commissioners are
drawn from the finance sector, which also funds the agency. Recently these
funders have been pushing for a greater role in selecting the commissioners.
Talk to banks and other financial institutions, and there appears to be a
strong sense of camaraderie with the regulators. They refer to the
supervisors by their first names and say they can always call them or
arrange a meeting within a few hours. It is a quintessentially British
system, but on a far more intimate, workable scale.
Officials are keen to point out that Guernsey was never created as an
artificial offshore centre. Indeed, they prefer to avoid use of the word
'offshore' altogether, in favour of 'finance' centre. But a growing element
of artificiality has begun to creep in as more and more centres compete in
an international beauty parade for business. Legislators and regulators are
being forced to look over their shoulders more often - not least at Jersey.
Mr John Roper, head of the FSC, talks about 'a pragmatic pragmatism.' In the
UK, the authorities can all but impose their rules on most individuals and
businesses, he argues. In Guernsey, by contrast, harsh conditions will
simply drive mobile international business away.
That is not to say that every change has favoured business. Insurance
companies were forced to come onshore for regulation in 1986. More
generally, tax exemptions in the past few years have all but put an end to
the 'Sark Lark', by which companies held meetings and had directors on the
nearby island of Sark to be offshore from the Guernsey authorities.
Tougher new banking and insurance laws are planned for this year, and in the
future there are plans for the regulation of stock brokers and fiduciaries -
something not yet attempted in the UK.
Most important, the system seems to have worked. Guernsey regulators have
simply refused entry to all but what they believe are the most reputable
companies after careful vetting. That, officials say, provides a far tighter
net than exists on mainland UK. Barnett Christie, a small bank with
imprudent lending, is the only significant financial embarrassment to have
affected the island in recent years.
The questions for the regulators are whether they can continue to handle the
potential tensions of acting as both regulators and promoters of financial
services; and whether their fragile discretionary authority would hold up if
challenged in the courts.
A final issue is that of secrecy. Guernsey has 14,000 limited companies  -
more than 10 times the number per capita in the UK. Yet the only public
information available on each is a list of directors and shareholders. It is
impossible to find the annual accounts of any of these businesses, or the
identity of their beneficial owners.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (2): Harsher climate for financial
services - In the past 20 years Guernsey has experienced dramatic change to
its economic base / The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUERNSEY has made its living in various ways over the centuries. In the
early 1800s, privateering flourished on the back of the Napoleonic wars.
Some of the proceeds from this lucrative trade were used to build up St
Peter Port, so that parts of the island's main town have a Georgian look to
this day.
In the late 1800s, there was brisk trade in dessert grapes. By the 1960s,
the main economic activity was the export of tomatoes and flowers. Tourism
was growing in importance.
But over the past 20 years Guernsey has experienced a dramatic change to its
economic base. On the one hand, horticulture has contracted because of
rising costs and falling prices, to a level where it represents 6 per cent
of gross national product today compared to 36 per cent in 1973.
On the other hand, financial services have grown to represent 51 per cent of
GNP in 1991, compared to 11 per cent in 1973. This arm of the economy is
further enhanced by another 20 per cent from the 'rentier' sector which
covers people whose main income is derived from investments such as deposit
interest, dividends, property and trusts.
The tourist sector has declined from 30 per cent of GNP in 1973 to 18 per
cent in 1991. There is a also a small industrial sector contributing 6 per
cent of GNP.
Some 16 per cent of the employed population now works in the financial
services industry with more than 300 employers. Approximately Pounds 32m in
income tax contributions were paid by the sector in 1990 - or 43 per cent of
the total.
There has been 15.6 per cent growth in population since the early 1970s and
gross national product at 1991 reflated prices has nearly doubled from
Pounds 434m in 1973 to Pounds 840m in 1991. Financial services have also
helped give Guernsey a self-supporting economy. Contrary to popular
supposition, it receives no grants from the mainland. It has no external
debt and it balances its budget each year.
The budget figures for 1993 show that of total current income of Pounds 154m
 -some 73 per cent of which is derived from income tax - Pounds 6.1m will be
put aside for capital expenditure.
The downside, if that is not too strong a word, of the growth is that by the
late 1980s the economy showed signs of overheating. By 1988 there was nil
unemployment. Foreign workers from Madeira were imported to work in
horticulture and tourism as locals were drawn off into financial services.
As local people started to receive good pay packets inflation crept up. It
was 8 per cent in 1990 while it was only 5.6 per cent on the mainland.
The pressures began to show up in housing. Although Guernsey has a two-tier
housing system with houses set aside for locals, prices rose sharply and
made it difficult for young people in particular to buy their own homes.
In order to try to balance the economy a little, the States tried, through
its budget, to subsidise horticulture for employment purposes. It arranged
cheap loans and in some cases gave grants. Mr John Dickson, head of
economics and statistics for the States, says: 'It was felt that we should
try and draw off some the wealth being made in financial services and make
sure that the rural economy survived.'
But recession, especially in tourism, has seen the Guernsey economy come
back in the past three years. Unemployment at 4 per cent is higher than it
has been for 15 years and inflation, at 3.5 per cent, is roughly in line
with that of Britain. There was little growth in the economy in 1991 and
little is expected for 1992.
For the future any attempt to encourage horticulture and industry will be
quietly dropped, according to Mr Dickson, and market forces will be allowed
to take their course. The emphasis will be on financial services, and trying
to revive tourism.
The going has got tougher. Mr John Roper, director-general of the Financial
Services Commission, says: 'The climate is harder for financial services if
for no other reason than interest rates in the UK, where much of the money
is deposited, have dropped substantially.' He believes, however, that
Guernsey is competitive and will continue to grow.
Tourism has failed to pick up because of recession. The tourism 'spend' is
put at Pounds 90m in 1992 compared with Pounds 120m in 1990.
Mr Mike Brown, head of the country's civil service, says: 'We are
optimistic. Financial services are not just one industry but many different
ones. There are all kinds of new products we can involve ourselves in. I am
sure the economy will pick up soon.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (1): An image of respectability - The key
to Guernsey's economic success must be in the expansion of the financial
services industry and a tough supervisory regime / Introduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRIEF stroll through the cobbled streets of St Peter Port, the capital,
will soon tell you what the dominant industry of Guernsey is. The clue lies
in the discreet brass nameplates on the handsome granite office buildings.
After a series of successful trading ventures starting with the lucrative
privateering of the 18th and 19th centuries, then granite-quarrying,
horticulture and tourism, Guernsey now derives more than half its revenue
from financial services.
Changes in economic circumstances are nothing new for the tiny island off
the coast of Normandy, but the past two decades have seen a particularly
dramatic change. More than 300 banks, insurance and investment houses have
been attracted to St Peter Port.
The reasons lie in the island's constitutional position and political
stability, its tax structure, and its firm but flexible regulatory system.
The Bailiwick of Guernsey, which also includes the islands of Alderney and
Sark, occupies with neighbouring Jersey a unique constitutional position. It
is not part of the UK and it is not a sovereign state or colony.
The British government is responsible for its foreign relations and defence,
but it has its own legislature and judiciary and runs its own economy free
from interference from either the UK or the European Community. Hence - with
income and corporate taxes at low levels and no inheritance, capital gains
or value added taxes - its attraction as an offshore financial centre.
Guernsey authorities are sensitive to the claim that the island deliberately
set out to become a tax haven. They point out that personal and corporate
taxes were set at 20 per cent in 1960 because of a cautious and prudent
budgetary policy, whereas offshore finance business did not come to the
island on any scale until the early 1970s.
One reason for the fast growth since then is the image of respectability
that Guernsey has carefully cultivated, in contrast to some offshore
centres. These days, offshore centres need to be squeaky-clean, whereas at
one time the whole point of tax havens was that they were free of
regulation.
Centres such as Guernsey now boast the same scale of financial supervision
and regulation as mainland jurisdictions. And in Guernsey, they also boast
that local regulators once rejected an application from the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International.
However, Guernsey has retained flexibility in its informal supervisory
system. Its authorities prefer to negotiate individually rather than set
firm rates of taxation that must be met. Offshore insurers, for example,
have the choice of paying full tax, reduced tax, or being exempt, thus
making Guernsey an attractive location for captives.
Mr John Roper, director-general of the island's Financial Services
Commission, and a former member of the Bank of England's supervisory
department, believes the answer to a successful offshore operation is to
exclude the villains in the first place.
He says: 'Our protection is a portfolio of well-supervised and well-run
banks. We are as anxious as anyone to make sure that one bad apple does not
harm our good business reputation.'
Guernsey regulators also argue that because they are slightly detached from
the political and civil service framework, banks and firms are more likely
to approach them for informal advice.
However, there is a possible conflict of interest for offshore regulators in
Guernsey and elsewhere. They are there to protect the probity and reputation
of the island, but they are also expected to promote the narrow business
interests of the local community.
Another difficulty Guernsey is aware of is its lack of a distinct identity.
As one of the Channel Islands, it is often confused with, or lumped together
with, Jersey, its bigger and higher-profile neighbour. There is a debate
about whether Guernsey should seek to differentiate itself more, possibly
through intensive marketing.
There is also an awareness that offshore financial business may no longer
gravitate towards Guernsey or any other centre quite so easily in future.
The growth of specialist EC financial centres such as Luxembourg and Dublin
has served to focus attention on the need constantly to expand and improve
services.
The tricky dilemma for Guernsey now is how to prevent the economy becoming
unbalanced by the strength of financial services. A central aspect of the
budgetary debate in the States - the island's parliament  - has been whether
this sector should be attracted in even greater volume in order to lift tax
revenues, or whether support should go into other sectors of the economy to
create a better balance.
The earning power and tax revenue from finance is way above anything that
can be achieved from other sectors, but there are strong political
objections to the increased immigration and environmental pressures that
could be generated.
There is already a very strict limit on the number of homes that can be
occupied by incomers and new housing developments are being limited to a
specific area in order to protect the island's rural attractions.
Attempts have been made to attract light industry, but shortages of land and
labour - and remoteness from raw materials and customers - has limited
manufacturing to 6 per cent of exports despite successes in a few niche
markets.
The judgment has been made to let industry and horticulture find their own
levels without any support. Agriculture, particularly the growing of
tomatoes, has fallen substantially in value in recent years, although
Guernsey remains an important source of cut flowers for the British market.
Tourism, the other traditionally important sector, is also heavily dependent
on the UK economy, and has seen a steep fall in visitors and spending
totals. Costs have been kept down by the use of foreign labour, however, and
the hope is that the sector will start to grow as the UK comes out of
recession.
A key section of Guernsey's economic and financial report last year,
outlining future economic development, concluded that the island was 'bound
to remain heavily reliant on a healthy financial services sector and buoyant
visitor economy, each of which is dependent on the other's success.' It
added: 'Quite simply, the economy is likely to remain relatively static over
the next five years unless there is a degree of stimulus injected into one
or both of these industries.'
The key to Guernsey's economic success must be in the expansion of the
financial services industry, supported by a tough supervisory regime. But
without a healthy tourist industry the island's infrastructure, especially
the frequent air and sea links that the brass-plated firms need, could not
be maintained.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Interest rates in French franc money market fall sharply

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rates in the French franc money market fell sharply yesterday amid
growing speculation that the Bank of France may cut the country's official
interest rates this week, writes James Blitz.
One-month French franc interest rates fell more than a full percentage point
from 11.20 per cent to 10.18 per cent.
Three-month interest rates also fell by a similar amount from 11.00 per cent
to below 10 per cent.

FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rebound from support levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market con-tinued to trade nervously around its support levels
yesterday as investors awaited developments at today's Pounds 3bn UK
government bond auction and tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank policy
council. The equity market is now moving towards the end of the first
quarter of 1993 and also the close of the UK financial year. Erratic trading
left the FT-SE 100 Index finishing 14.5 ahead, but only after bouncing from
the 2,850 support level in early dealing.
Views on the near-term outlook for shares remained sharply divided, with the
revival of interest rate speculation adding spice to the debate. While any
repetition of the January drama, when base rates were cut on the eve of a
gilt-edged auction, is already out of the question, market strategists will
scan today's bond auction closely for signs of the views on interest rates
held by the institutions. From the Bundesbank, nothing more than a further
slackening in repurchase rates is thought likely, and that probably not this
week.
Equities opened firmly, helped by indications of a rally in the big
pharmaceutical stocks in New York, which left some houses with orders to top
up trading books in London. Heavy losses in the blue chip drug shares has
been a significant feature in the recent slide in the UK market.
The improvement put about 18 points on the Footsie, but the gain proved the
best of the day and was shortlived. By mid-morning the index was only 3.5
ahead at 2,850, although from this level it quickly bounced. For the rest of
the session the market advanced in modest trading to close at Footsie 2,861,
a gain of 14.5 on the day.
The erratic pattern reflected a generally cautious policy by fund managers,
some of whom have virtually stopped trading until the new UK tax year opens
on April 6. Seaq trading volume rose sharply to 734.7m shares yesterday, but
was swollen by a big placing of Owners Abroad shares and by activity in two
new issues.
On Monday, Seaq volume of 487.2m shares was worth only Pounds 1.08bn in
retail business, underlining the reduction in activity by the institutions;
daily retail business has averaged around Pounds 1.5bn in recent weeks. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less volatile than the FT-SE 100, added 4.7 at 3,096.3.
Trading in non-FT-SE 100 stocks slipped to around 59 per cent of total
volume.
The traditional slowdown in equity trading ahead of the year-end has left
some market strategists uncertain regarding the outlook for a market now
little changed from the levels at which it started the year. Question marks
still hang over the pace of the recovery in the domestic economy, and thus
in corporate earnings. Funding pressure in the bond market is also seen as a
competitor for investment cash, and some fear that other European stock
markets offer greater prospects for the near term.
However, Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research Institute remains firmly in
the van of the bull charge, and last night reaffirmed his target of Footsie
3,500, in spite of the current struggle to hold 2,850.
'I am particularly bullish right now. The institutions are not sellers of
this market and overseas buyers are poised to buy UK stocks when the end of
the quarter influences are over,' he said.

   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The clearing late last week of a large overhang of stock in Lloyds Bank,
which had acted as a considerable drag on the share price, enabled Lloyds
shares to outpace the rest of a generally buoyant sector.
The stock finished 12 stronger at 535p, although turnover was a relatively
light 2.1m shares.
A bank specialist said the fall in the share price to around 510p last week
provided 'a perfect buying opportunity', adding that the recent changes
introduced in the Budget prompted strong institutional demand for companies
with the capability to deliver above-average dividend increases. The
prospect of a further cut in UK interest rates was also seen as very
positive for the stock.

FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Gas at new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGGRESSIVE buying in both cash and traded options markets drove British Gas
to an all-time high in very heavy turnover. The shares ended 11 1/2 ahead at
314 1/2 p, after a day's peak of 315p. Turnover reached 14.2m.
Energy specialists said the shares had responded to a handful of large
buying orders in midsession, most notably the purchase of a block of 1.5m
shares at 313p. It was also suggested that marketmakers had sought to hedge
positions in the traded options market. Turnover in British Gas traded
options totalled 586 contracts.
There were hints that at least one influential broking house had shifted to
a positive stance on the shares, although this could not be confirmed.
British Gas, along with other utility issues, is viewed by fund managers as
one of the market's best defensive stocks.

FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures traded in a tight 20-point range, with dealers choosing
to wait for news from tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting and today's UK
government bond auction, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 2,876 and followed the
recent trend of being in demand at the start of trading, with the talk this
time focusing on the possibility of a cut in interest rates . This sent June
forward and by 10am it was trading at 2,884, which turned out to be the
day's high.
With no follow-through buying, June retreated to the day's low of 2,863 just
ahead of lunchtime. It hovered around that level until mid-afternoon, when
bargain hunting brought renewed buying of the contract.
June finished at 2,879, around 8 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash, which now stands at 11 points. Turnover remained poor at
6,962 lots.
The volume in traded options improved from Monday's dull level, reaching
22,374 contracts by the close. Some 7,597 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100
option, although there was little activity in the Euro FT-SE, a mere 923
trades being recorded.
Cable and Wireless was the busiest stock option, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
said to have accounted for the majority of the day's activity. It was
followed by BT at 1,050 lots and Marks and Spencer at 1,008.

FT  31 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Consumer confidence drop
restrains Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Wall Street
LEADING US stock prices moved in a narrow trading range yesterday after
sentiment was undermined by the news of a large fall in a closely watched
index of consumer confidence, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.17 at 3,457.27. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.20 firmer at 451.97,
while the American SE composite was a marginal 0.37 ahead at 419.68. Demand
for technology stocks was the driving force for an advance of 5.49 to 686.25
by the Nasdaq composite index.
New York SE trading volume totalled 230m shares, while rises held an
advantage over declines by 1,031 to 866.
There was no follow-through from Monday's solid gains, a reflection of
continued uncertainty about the outlook for the US economy. That mood of
uncertainty deepened after the Conference Board announced a decline in its
March consumer confidence index from 68.5 per cent to 62.6 per cent.
Analysts had been expecting the index to fall only slightly, and the news
upset the market, which has been concerned at the recent fragility of
consumer confidence in spite of the apparent strength of the economic
recovery.
Sentiment was also undermined by a drop in bond prices, which pushed the
yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond back up through 6.9 per cent.
Until last week, investors had hoped that bond yields would fall as low as
6.5 per cent, but since then the reversal in the bond market has dashed
those hopes.
Computer and technology issues were mixed. IBM, which had gained some ground
in recent days on the appointment of a new chairman, weakened Dollars 1 5/8
to Dollars 50 in volume of more than 2.5m shares, and Digital Equipment
dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 43 7/8 . Some traders speculated that
renewed worries about another dividend cut from IBM were behind the selling.
In contrast elsewhere in the sector, Hewlett-Packard firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 75 3/4 and Compaq added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 50 1/4 .
Wal-Mart tumbled Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/8 in volume of 7m shares
after Prudential Securities, the Wall Street brokerage house, lowered its
forecast for the retailer's first-quarter net income from 21 cents a share
to 19 cents. Fisher-Price plunged Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 20 1/8 in volume
of 1.7m shares after the toy manufacturer announced late on Monday that it
expects its first-quarter revenues to be about 15 per cent lower than last
year's Dollars 146.8m.
Instrument Systems rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 following a ratings
upgrade from broking house Oppenheimer.
Among drug stocks, Marion Merrell Dow added Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 19 1/4
, Merck rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 35 7/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson put on
Dollars 2 at Dollars 42 and Pfizer advanced Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 62 1/2
.
On the Nasdaq market, Commonwealth Bancshares soared Dollars 9 1/2 to
Dollars 42 3/4 on news that the company had signed a definitive pact to
merge with Meridian Bancorp in a Dollars 357m deal. Meridian eased Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 32 1/4 . Technology stocks were in demand, with Microsoft
climbing Dollars 4 to Dollars 91 in volume of 4.4m shares and Apple
appreciating Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO ended slightly higher after brisk dealings as a surge in gold shares
offset losses in most other sectors. The Toronto SE said today's volume was
the sixth highest daily total on record.
The TSE 300 index gained a mere 0.9 at 3,586.1 and rises narrowly led falls
by 346 to 339 after volume of 66.9m shares.
The gold bullion price, which rallied to finish Cdollars 4.90 an ounce
higher, lifted Canadian gold shares.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian shares rose another 1.9 per cent in moderate midday trade on the
Sao Paulo bourse, following their 3.7 per cent gain on Monday, the Bovespa
index putting on 366 to 19,155 at 1300 local time. Telebras, the state-run
telecommunications company, rose 2.8 per cent to Cr591.
Equities were boosted yesterday by a government decision to set a Dollars
60m cash requirement on the sale of steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica
Nacional (CSN).
CSN's privatisation auction is scheduled for Friday, at a minimum price of
Dollars 1.6bn.
The market was concerned, however, about the possibility of a higher than
expected increase in March inflation after overnight call money interest
rates rose to 36.13 per cent a month, from 34.03 per cent a month late on
Monday.

FT  31 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns lower as
trusts take profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE profit-taking by investment trusts and corporate investors eroded
morning gains, and the Nikkei average slipped below 19,000, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost a net 85.22 at 18,963.16 after a day's high of 19,089.14. It
set a low of 18,853.24 in the afternoon, but then improved as share prices
recouped some of their losses towards the end on bargain hunting by
individuals.
Volume declined from 678m shares to 620m and falls finally led rises by 550
to 489, with 135 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 2.48 to 1,452.54, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped
3.48 to 1,155.06.
Traders said sentiment was still firm. Foreigners have been leading buyers
of late, although some remain sceptical over economic recovery. 'Everyone is
afraid of missing a rally,' said one analyst. For example, foreign ownership
of Sumitomo Bank's tradable shares - those not held by stable shareholders -
has risen from 18 to 63 per cent.
Daily average trading volume for March is expected to top 400m shares for
the first time since September 1991. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said
about one-half of recent activity had been generated by dealers.
At corporate level, a front page article in a local business daily, saying
that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was considering raising local rates
on regular phones, boosted Nippon Telegraph and Telephone by Y34,000 to
Y875,000. The rise pushed up other telecom-related shares, Kyowa Exeo adding
Y100 at Y1,090 and Fujikura gaining Y65 at Y838.
Tsumura, the largest manufacturer of Chinese medicines, was the top
performing stock, advancing by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,430. Reports
that it has found an anti-Aids drug among Chinese herbal medicine
preparations encouraged speculators. Green Cross, a speculative favourite,
moved ahead Y60 to Y1,370.
Financial institutions were lower on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan
lost Y40 to Y2,520 and Sakura Bank slipped Y20 to Y1,310.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 41.22 at 20,388.14 in volume of 37m shares.
Retail and electronics issues were higher. Nintendo, the video game maker,
gained Y170 at Y9,760.
Roundup
SOME OF THE Pacific Basin markets put on strong per-formances yesterday.
HONG KONG took heart at political developments, although late profit-taking
trimmed gains from futures-linked buying. The Hang Seng index ended 83.59,
or 1.3 per cent, higher at 6,406.49, having peaked at 6,442.43, in turnover
of HKDollars 3.91bn.
News that the Executive Council had not decided on a date for submitting the
Hong Kong governor's democratic reform bill to the legislature added to the
advance.
Lower than expected government land auction prices came too late to be
reflected in the market and properties made a strong showing.
Cheung Kong rose 20 cents to HKDollars 22.90, Henderson Land added 60 cents
at HKDollars 19.10 and Hysan was 20 cents higher at HKDollars 14.70. Swire
Pacific, whose property unit took a stake in the biggest lot sold, rose 75
cents to HKDollars 33.25.
AUSTRALIAN stocks rallied after data showed a higher January current account
deficit, but most of the gains were subsequently given up and the All
Ordinaries index closed just 1.2 ahead at 1,678.2 in turnover of ADollars
296.6m.
BHP eased 2 cents to ADollars 14.86 after saying that a 24-hour strike in
its steel division had cost about 20,000 tonnes in lost production of raw
steel.
Great Central Mines, the diamond and gold explorer, climbed ADollars 3
further to ADollars 18 on strong US interest.
MANILA edged higher in quiet trading and the composite index rose 8.30 to
1,448.40.
PLDT firmed 5 pesos to 900 pesos. Late the previous day President Fidel
Ramos had ordered an investigation into the ownership of shares to resolve a
long-running dispute between the government, the family of the former
president, Ferdinand Marcos, and two other prominent local families over
ownership of a holding company which has 24 per cent of the shares.
TAIWAN closed sharply higher on buying triggered by the Formosa Plastics
group's announcement on Monday that it would soon begin building its
long-delayed USDollars 7.5bn naphtha cracker. The weighted index rose
144.05, or 3.1 per cent, to 4,750.70 in fairly active turnover of TDollars
59.54bn.
The plastics sector added 4.1 per cent in response to the developments and
Formosa strengthened TDollars 2.70 to TDollars 45.
BOMBAY continued its retreat under year-end selling pressure, the BSE index
finishing 74.12, or 3.3 per cent, lower at 2,202.78.

FT  31 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Quito frames its market laws under the
volcano - Sarita Kendall on an equity revolution in Ecuador
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two laws which should revolutionise the size and scope of the Ecuadorian
stock market are being put to Congress by the government. The modernisation
law, including the framework for a far-reaching privatisation programme, has
already raised heated debate in and out of Congress. The capital markets
project also covers a lot of ground and is designed to develop and regulate
the stock market, so that it can play a major part in the privatisation
process.
Financial experts believe that it would have been more logical to send the
capital markets law through first, particularly as the government is
extremely anxious to guarantee 'total transparency' (a modish phrase in
Quito) for privatisation. Mr Edison Ortiz, president of the Quito stock
exchange, expects the law to slip through fairly easily: 'It will
professionalise the market and ensure high ethical and technical standards.
The government wants to show that it is possible to privatise without
overconcentration of shares.'
The Quito stock exchange, which began operating in 1970, could hardly be
quieter. Up above one of the main business streets, with a magnificent view
of the semi-active volcano that looms over the city, the glass phone booths
are empty; there is a slight flurry among the half-dozen present as some
local bank shares are offered for sale.
But Mr Ortiz believes this will soon change: 'With privatisation, the total
value of operations could go from USDollars 100m a year to USDollars 2bn -
or more if the unregulated market can be formalised. We want to bring in as
many investors and institutions as possible.'
Shares account for less than 1 per cent of market transactions in Quito and
Guayaquil; the 1992 figure was just under half a million dollars. Although
this is partly due to the fact that most business is done outside the stock
exchange, very few shares are traded in Ecuador. Companies tend to be
family-run, with capital raised through the family network. While there is a
growing demand for shares, prices have remained surprisingly low: stocks are
so prized, and the alternatives are so limited, that people prefer not to
sell.
The last two months of 1992 brought a sudden jump in trading and the surge
is expected to continue as the state sells off shares in mixed companies.
This can be done without any new legislation: it is the sale of assets in
more sensitive (and juicier) areas, such as telecommunications, that is at
stake in Congress.
'Big companies like the cement works would add a lot of liquidity to the
market,' says Mr Alberto Dorfzaun, president of the Investban financial and
stockbroking group. 'Things are changing, there are more opportunities,
shares are starting to pick up. Most people hold on to them because they are
such a good investment.'
Although plans for privatisation cover virtually all sectors, including
electricity, ports, railways and oil, the government is still undecided
about specific mechanisms. Concern about political reaction, monopolies and
transparency has dictated caution, but the programme must get under way
rapidly in order to produce results within President Sixto Duran Ballen's
four-year term.
Attracting foreign investment and returning capital is essential for the
privatisation of the bigger companies and the government has promised to put
foreign investors on the same footing as nationals. A decree published in
January eased registration and reduced red tape, but all-important tax
differences still have to be tackled. Foreign companies pay 36 per cent
income tax, compared with the national rate of 25 per cent, and foreign
investment funds are liable for 8 per cent capital gains tax.
Liberalisation of the Ecuadorian economy, with access to much larger
markets, should push local companies to raise capital on the stock exchange.
Mr Ortiz expects companies to open up and new shares to be traded more
frequently; market commissions have been reduced, pension funds are to be
encouraged and the Quito stock exchange is beginning to sell itself more
actively. Once the rules are in place, the phone lines should start buzzing.

FT  31 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan lacerated by political
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Market Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were balanced between interest rate hopes in a number of countries,
French fears about oil refining margins and Italy's crumbling economic and
political scene, writes Our Market Staff.
MILAN was overwhelmed for much of the session by speculation that the Prime
Minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, was about to resign. The Comit index fell 10.56
or 2.1 per cent to 476.91.
Privatisation issues, now effectively on hold, at least until after the
electoral reform referendum on April 18, came under pressure. Credito
Italiano fixed L145 lower at L2,580 and slid to L2,555 on the kerb while
Banca Commerciale Italiana fell L199 to L4,252.
Continuing speculation about the possibility of an international accord
provided some support for Fiat. The shares fixed L50 higher at L5,900 but
fell back in late business to L5,730.
Benetton fell L183 to L14,933 with its 12 per cent rise in 1992 net profit,
announced late on Monday, failing to match expectations.
FRANKFURT noted Bundesbank supportfor small interest rate cuts, and staged a
late rally which took the DAX index up 10.15 to 1,685.07.
Turnover recovered from DM4.7bn to DM6.1bn. Mr Nigel Longley, of
Commerzbank, said that the main corporate story of the day was Siemens,
DM7.90 higher at DM648.90 in turnover up from DM726m to DM1.1bn. Following
the German embargo on submarine orders for Taiwan, there was news of power
station orders from China.
Porsche rose DM23 or 5.8 per cent to DM500 on to a chart signal, trading in
unusually heavy lots in an illiquid market. Commerbank itself rose DM6.30 to
DM710.60, responding to a story in a New York newspaper.
PARIS lost its impetus in late afternoon as oil stocks were hit by worries
about refining margins, the CAC-40 closing just 2.05 higher at 2,035.91.
Total and Elf Aquitaine fell FFr5.40 to FFr259, and FFr4.60 to FFr384.40 in
reaction to Esso SAF results and its chairman's pessimistic outlook for
1993. Esso itself dropped a weighty FFr84, or 10.3 per cent to FFr735.
Turnover was FFr3.9bn, a far cry from last Friday's total which, with block
activity outside the market or after market hours, added up to an all-time
record of FFr8.4bn, said Mr John Fordyce at Ferri International. Yesterday's
Kleinwort Benson/Paribas placing of Carrefour's 28.8 per cent stake in
Castorama, meanwhile, brought plaudits for the brokers but left Carrefour
FFr47 lower at FFr2,686.
ZURICH finished at a record high that took the SMI index up 13.0 to 2,189.3
ahead of the Roche results tomorrow. Ciba's 19 per cent profits rise was in
line with expectations but the bearers fell SFr9 to SFr637 on news that the
group planned to introduce a single share class. The registered rose SFr4 to
SFr618.
Roche certificates added SFr40 to SFr4,180 ahead of Thursday's results,
expected by some dealers to be strong.
Among engineering issues, Schindler rose SFr200 or 4.4 per cent to SFr4,670
but analysts said they knew of no particular reason for the rise.
AMSTERDAM saw a slight pick up in turnover with renewed optimism about the
economic outlook provoking demand from institutional investors. The CBS
Tendency index added 0.90 to 107.30.
Akzo, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, shed Fl 1.70 to Fl 149.30
after a newspaper report about lower German drugs sales.
Nutricia, the food group added Fl 3.00 to Fl 128.50 in continued response to
Monday's results while the publisher VNU rose Fl 2.30 to Fl 108.60 on
raising its stake in a Belgian television company.
MADRID closed at a 1993 high, boosted by hopes of a cut in interest rates
and a rush of end of quarter trade. The general index rose 1.71 to 241.40 in
turnover of Pta33.28bn.
COPENHAGEN gained support from recent rate cuts and the KFX index rose 1.35
per cent to 81.20. East Asiatic, the shipping and consumer products group,
added DKr13 or 19 per cent to DKr81 after the sale of its shipping
activities to AP Moller. HELSINKI continued higher, the Hex index adding
1.45 per cent at 1,033.1, for a rise of 7.6 per cent over the last five
trading sessions. Nokia preferred shares firmed FM3 to FM128 on the more
positive outlook.
ISTANBUL rose another 1.7 pct as fresh cash came in from maturing repurchase
agrrements in the bond market, the market index closing 96.87 higher at
5,861.81 for a two-day gain of 3.6 per cent.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira breaks the L1000 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE ITALIAN lira weakened yesterday
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
piercing the L1000 level to the D-Mark in early morning trading in Milan -
following speculation that Mr Giuliano Amato, the country's prime minister,
was planning to resign, writes James Blitz.
After closing in London at L987.6 to the D-Mark on Monday night, the lira
touched L1004 against the German currency in Milan yesterday morning. In
London, the pressure on the currency was only slightly more restrained, with
the lira being offered at L1000, but failing to trade at that level.
London dealers said that much of the selling of lire was speculative,
although Italy's bond prices suffered a sharp fall as institutional
investors hurried to get out of Italian-denominated assets.
The currency later rebounded following reports that Mr Amato would continue
to stay in office. The lira closed at L990.1 to the D-Mark, a net L2.4
weaker on the day.
Recent runs on the lira have involved sharp selling of the currency by
private Italian citizens, but there were no reports of this yesterday.
Mr Mark Austin, a Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, warned that
there might be more pressure on the currency if the Italian media pays much
attention to the breaking of the psychologically important L1000 figure.
In sharp contrast, the French franc was firm against the D-Mark yesterday
morning following Mr Edouard Balladur's nomination as France's new prime
minister. The franc rose to FFr3.392 in the morning, but later fell back to
close in London at FFr3.396 to the D-Mark.
There is a growing belief that the new French government will cut official
interest rates soon, especially if the Bundesbank eases the repo rate in its
weekly money market operations today.
However, Ms Wendy Niffikeer, an economist at IBJ International, said the
franc had not strengthened sufficiently to allow the Bank of France to ease
policy. 'Unless the franc strengthens to FFr3.37 to the D-Mark and stays
there for a few days, I am not sure France will be able to cut rates,' she
added.
Sterling lost  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.4225, amid
continuing speculation that the UK authorities might cut base rates to
counter a threatened rise in the mortgage rate by building societies.
However, the currency performed strongly against a generally weak dollar,
ending nearly  1/2 cent up at Dollars 1.4950.
The dollar fell as low as DM1.6165 yesterday following a 6 percentage-point
drop in the February US consumer confidence index.
The US unit closed nearly a net pfennig down at DM1.6200. In New York it
ended at DM1.6170. Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss Banking Corporation, a long-time
dollar bear, believes the currency could slip below DM1.60 on Friday
afternoon if the payroll data are on the soft side. He believes the dollar
could yet see DM1.52.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Money Markets: French rates tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were strong expect-ations yesterday that official French franc
interest rates would be cut this week, following the appointment of a new
French prime minister by President Francois Mitterrand, writes James Blitz.
The French government being formed by Mr Edouard Balladur is under strong
pressure to reduce interest rates because of the slowdown in the country's
economy.
Until now, the franc's weakness in the exchange rate mechanism has been a
strong constraint on policy easing. But yesterday, the currency continued to
profit from the decisive result for the centre-right alliance in the
National Assembly elections.
This raised speculation that the Bank of France might take the opportunity
to cut its five to 10-day interest rate from the painfully high level of 12
per cent. One-month French franc interest rates fell nearly 100 basis points
yesterday from 11.20 per cent to 10.18 per cent. Three-month interest rates
fell from 11.00 per cent to below 10 per cent.
There was a similarly upbeat tone in the French franc futures market. The
June contract rose some 12 basis points from its previous close to a high of
91.64, before finishing at 91.60. The September contract was finally 19
basis points higher at 92.83.
One factor adding to the upbeat sentiment in France was the Bundesbank's
announcement that it would be offering a variable rate repo in its weekly
securities repurchase tender today.
There are strong expect-ations that the lowest accepted bid for the repo
will fall some 10 or 15 basis points from the current level of 8.25 per
cent.
Underlining this view was the sharp fall in German call money yesterday from
8.15 per cent on Monday night to 7.80 per cent by last night. Conditions in
the German money market are highly liquid because many banks have reached
their reserve requirements.
Sterling markets remained bullish as expectations grew that the UK
authorities might lower base rates to deal with a threatened rise in
mortgage lending rates by the nation's building societies.
Three-month money closed at 5 7/8 per cent from a previous close of 6 1/32
per cent. The overnight rate was as low as 2 per cent following another
small shortage in the Bank of England's operations.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Last ditch attempt to break the
log-jam - Coffee talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ON renewing the international coffee agreement appear set to end in
failure in London today, although last minute attempts to find a way out of
a morass of technical issues were continuing late into yesterday evening.
Mr Arnoldo Lopez, chairman of a special committee looking for ways to
unblock the talks, said at the International Coffee Organisation
headquarters that delegates had recognised that they could not reach an
agreement by today's deadline. But he insisted that there was a prevailing
mood of optimism, hinting that the talks might be extended.
The London robusta market closed down yesterday, the May contract touching
Dollars 853 a tonne before recovering to Dollars 862 a tonne, off Dollars 11
on the day.
The move followed Monday's retreat in New York, where arabica prices were
showing some signs of recovery in early trading yesterday.
Analysts in both London and New York were dismissive of any hopes that an
agreement with economic clauses would emerge from the latest talks.
'I never thought that we would have an agreement, and I'm glad that they
might finally shoot this dead horse,' said Ms Judy Ganes, analyst with
Merrill Lynch in New York.
Mr Peter Kettle, analyst with ED &amp; F. Man in London, said both producers and
consumers held strong views, and neither side appeared prepared to give way.
The London May contract is now Dollars 30 below the level when the ICO talks
started at the beginning of last week, while the New York May contract was
more than 4 cents a lb down on Monday.
Mr Kettle pointed out that ICO negotiations, which have been spread across
the past four years, have always had a negative effect on prices. Even
though the market always expected nothing to emerge from the talks, it was
still disappointed when nothing did.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec resolve faces test of
March output figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRODUCTION discipline among members of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has given oil prices a boost in the past couple of
weeks.
But the market has since settled into a tight range as traders await final
output figures for the club's March production.
Opec members are believed to have pumped between 24m barrels a day (b/d) and
24.3m b/d in March. This is still some way above the organisation's ceiling
of 23.58m b/d which was set in February, but indicates that countries are at
least cutting back from last month's high output levels of around 24.6m b/d.
'There will be some leaks, but it doesn't matter. The market can absorb it
and this is better than expected,' said Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS
Phillips and Drew, the UK stockbrokers.
Others are less sanguine, expressing concern about expected Iranian
over-production. Iran's output is estimated at anywhere between 3.5m b/d and
3.8m b/d, which implies some decline from its level of 3.85m b/d in
February, but still above its quota of 3.34m b/d.
'If Iran doesn't show much of a production decline by April, I will be quite
concerned about the market prospects because it raises the prospect of
Kuwait cheating,' said Mr Gary Ross, chief executive of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates in New York.
Mr Ali al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, has threatened to produce more than
his country's quota if he sees any other members flouting their own
production ceilings. But Mr al-Baghli reasserted at the weekend that Kuwait
was sticking to its quota of 1.6m b/d. This is backed up by some independent
surveys and tanker tracking data.
Oil prices on the International Petroleum Exchange have been trading in a
range for the past week as volumes have been low. The market is searching
for a direction and traders have seized upon Opec as the guiding factor.
Brent crude for delivery in June was Dollars 18.76 a barrel, down 17 cents,
on the IPE last night.
'We'll all be looking for the nature of seepage from the Opec agreement,'
said Mr Peter Hills, head of the energy desk in London at ED &amp; F. Man, the
international commodities house. Mr Hills said the market will not be
concerned if all members are overproducing slightly, but if the extra
barrels are coming from Iran, it will perceive more of a problem.
World demand for the second quarter is expected to be 1.3 per cent higher
than last year. Mr Pyne believes that if Opec can keep its production at
24.2m b/d in the second quarter, Brent prices will average Dollars 19 a
barrel and could reach Dollars 20 a barrel.
Opec ministers will meet informally in Oman on April 13 to review market
developments, but they are unlikely to set any policy. Ministers talks are
expected to focus on Opec's opposition to carbon taxes.
A difficulty facing the club's next formal meeting in early June could be a
demand from Kuwait for parity with the United Arab Emirates which produces
around 2.2m b/d.
This could mean Kuwait absorbing any overall increase in Opec production
towards the end of the year, which will be hard for Saudi Arabia and Iran to
stomach. Both countries are facing revenue shortfalls.
In addition, some market rumours and US press reports suggest that Iraq is
breaking the United Nations' embargo on exporting its crude.
So far, this is reported to have been a trickle of sales to Iran via a
refinery in Sudan, but the prospect of Iraqi oil returning to the
international market could ruin the current price stability.
In the meantime, all eyes are on Opec and official estimates of member
countries' production levels which are due out by the end of the week. This
could be enough to jolt prices out of their current range.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold leads precious metals up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCITEMENT returned to the precious metals markets yesterday with gold
leading the way. Trade buying in Europe started gold's rise and US funds
pushed it higher, dealers said. The metal broke through two important
technical barriers - at USDollars 334 a troy ounce and then Dollars 336 - to
close in London at Dollars 336.15 an ounce, up Dollars 4.30 from Monday's
close.
Gold's 'side bearers,' silver and platinum were carried up by the bullish
sentiment. Platinum's price in London rose by Dollars 4.90 an ounce to close
at Dollars 360.25 and silver closed at Dollars 3.79 an ounce, up 5.5 cents.
'Gold has been building up a head of steam for some time,' Mr Nick Moore,
analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, pointed out. 'The
volume was thin but, for a change, producers did not spoil the show by
selling forward.'
This was probably because the Australian dollar price of gold recently had
dropped sharply and the US dollar price was still relatively low.
Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services
group, suggested gold prices probably had 'bottomed out.' But he warned 'the
upside is fairly limited, with spot prices of Dollars 340 to Dollars 350 an
ounce tending to be the top end.'
He said: 'If prices were to rise suddenly by Dollars 10 to Dollars 15 an
ounce there is little doubt that Asian demand would dry up very rapidly and
we would expect to see selling by investment jewellery holders in both Asia
and the Middle East.'
Mr Arnold also suggested that higher prices could stimulate some central
bank selling. 'In my opinion the market is bottoming out. But it does not
follow from this that gold should rise by Dollars 30 to Dollars 70 an ounce
over the next six to nine months as some contend.'

ALUMINIUM prices fell to 14 1/2 -month lows on the LME. Three-month metal
failed to hold Dollars 1,150 a tonne once early Far Eastern currency-linked
buying had run its course. Renewed liquidation and sell stops pushed the
market down. Fundamentals remain gloomy, as stocks continue to grow and no
increase in demand is likely in the immediate future. Consumers are able to
bide their time, and traders see the market falling back towards Dollars
1,100. COPPER was briefly unsettled by aluminium's losses, but mostly held
steady, with the market well supported in a narrow range, dealers said. Dips
below Dollars 2,160 a tonne for three-month metal attracted buying and light
Chinese interest, although there did not appear to be much upside potential
above Dollars 2,170, given the increase in stocks. Chicago WHEAT prices were
higher in early trading, with May leading the advance, after an USDA
official said that Russia would need 11m to 12m tonnes between July 1993 and
June 1994. There was little chance that it could purchase more grain from
the EC, Canada or France.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Everything to play for in
China's Tarim basin - Tony Walker explains why the oil majors are lining up
despite past disappointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN registrations close in Beijing today for what may prove to be one of
the world's last great oil basins, dozens of international oil companies
will have signed up for seismic data gleaned from sketchy surveys of China's
remote far western region.
Mr Liu Song Wei, President of the China National Petroleum Corporation
International, said in an interview that the response from the oil industry
to the opening of new onshore areas had been 'very encouraging'. Among oil
majors that had shown strong interest, he said, were Shell, Amoco, Arco,
Unico and BP, among several others.
After years of hesitation, China is at last inviting bids to explore its
Tarim basin, located in the Central Asian Xinjiang region; and while foreign
companies are wary because of the region's inaccessibility - a Tarim basin
pipeline would need to be longer than the Alaska one - they feel bound to
pursue the opportunity.
'The question is not whether we can afford to be involved, but whether we
can afford not to be involved,' said the Beijing representative of a large
European oil company.
Wariness among foreign oil companies in China is understandable, given the
disappointments many suffered in their search for oil offshore. BP, for
example, spent about UDollars 200m drilling dry well after dry well in the
1980s in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River Delta, and it was far from alone in
its singular lack of success in Chinese waters.
China's offshore areas had, incidentally been billed as one of the world's
last great 'oil plays,' hence nervousness among oil explorers when similar
hyperbole is used to describe prospects in the Tarim basin whose reserves,
based on fairly flimsy evidence, are being likened to those of Saudi Arabia.
When Dr Wang Tao, President of China National Petroleum Corporation,
announced in February that China was opening 12 additional onshore areas in
the north of the country to foreign exploration, including the prized Tarim
basin, it marked a substantial and belated turnaround in policy, not only
for China, but also for Dr Wang himself.
Above all, the decision represented a painful admission that China, which is
expected to become a net importer of oil by the mid 1990s, simply did not
have the capital or expertise to develop a region of the Tarim basin's
dimensions, remoteness and technical difficulty.
The spiralling demand for energy generated by China's booming economy -
economic growth neared 13 per cent last year - almost certainly spurred the
change of heart. Mr Liu admitted as much when he said that 'since China's
economy is growing so fast we need more energy resources, and if we don't
make a big discovery maybe we will have to import. We need foreign
investment to speed up activity.'
The reality for China is that even if a foreign company strikes it rich
immediately, oil would not be flowing from the Tarim basin into the
country's pipeline grid much before the end of the century. The Chinese,
therefore, are in for a painful few years coping with an oil shortfall.
China's current output is about 2.8m b/d, and exports are running at about
400,000 b/d, down from a peak of 600,000
b/d in 1985. Oil production limped upwards by about 1.6 per cent last year,
but only after substantial investment in recovery enhancement for the mature
Daqing oilfield in the North East, which accounts for 40 per cent of China's
oil, and whose reserves are rapidly diminishing.
China's success in drawing foreign explorers into the search for onshore oil
has been patchy. Since, 1985 when the foreigners were first given access to
11 southern provinces - foreign companies regard these areas as marginal -
from Jiangsu in the north to Hainan island in the south, some five
exploration agreements were concluded, none of which have yielded a
commercial find.
Mr Liu said delays in opening the Tarim basin were explained by the time
needed by the Chinese side to conduct preliminary surveys and to prepare
basic infrastructure such as airports and trunk roads to enable foreign
companies to gain access to the region. 'You have to remember,' he said,
'that China itself did not start exploring in the Tarim basin until 1978.'
The Chinese official was cautious about prospects in the Tarim basin, but he
noted that preliminary studies indicated that reserves might be 'very
promising'. China itself did not have a firm estimate of possible
recoverable reserves, but he said that a figure of about 10bn tonnes did not
seem unreasonable, based on initial studies.
China, Mr Liu noted, had found oil near the five blocks covering 72,730
square kilometres being offered for exploration in the southern Tarim basin.
It produced about 100,000 tonnes from these small-scale efforts last year.
He revealed that design work had begun on a pipeline to carry the oil some
3,700 kilometres from the Tarim basin to Luoyang in central Henan province
where it would enter the country's national grid to be pumped to coastal
loading terminals such as Qingdao, or to be used domestically.
Mr Liu estimated that it would take 3-5 years for the pipeline to be built,
but speed of construction would depend on the 'size of the reservoirs'
discovered by foreign explorers. CNPC, would participate in the financing of
the pipeline, but would also be looking to foreign companies for
contributions.
In recognition of the costs associated with exploring in such an
inhospitable region and moving oil thousands of kilometres from China's vast
hinterland, the authorities were reviewing financial conditions. China was
'prepared to do more to improve the investment environment for foreign oil
companies' in difficult locales such as the Tarim basin, Mr Liu said.
Later this year, State Council or cabinet would probably approve separate
regulations from those applying to offshore exploration later this year.
This might involve an extension of the exploration period, and greater
flexibility in the formula used to calculate both the cost recovery
component of oil sold and also profit share.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mozambique will become graphite
producer in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOZAMBIQUE WILL join the world's graphite producers at the begining of next
year because both the European Investment Bank and the Commonwealth
Development Corporation have agreed to provide funding for the USDollars
11.5m Ancuabe project in the Cabo Delgado province.
The CDC will also take a 10 per cent shareholding in the Ancuabe project
company. Most natural flake graphite is used for refractory products such as
refractory bricks, crucibles, retorts and so on and Kenmare Resources, the
Irish company which owns 65 per cent of the project company, says it already
has customers lined up in the US and Europe.
The EIB, the world's largest provider of project funding, is providing ECU
2.9m of senior debt in the project on concessionary terms, representing half
the required senior debt. The EIB is also to provide an additional soft loan
to the Mozambique government to enable the government to pay for its 25 per
cent share of the project equity. The CDC will provide the other half of the
senior debt with a USDollars 3.45m loan. Kenmare says that it will produce
10,000 tonnes of graphite a year.

S&amp;P Australian Ratings, the Australian arm of Standard &amp; Poor's, the US

plus from BB.
S&amp;P said it regarded as 'positive' the emergence of Broken Hill Proprietary,

FT  31 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Italian paper recovers from political
worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN government bonds tumbled over a point on political worries yesterday
morning, but recovered some of the ground in volatile trading later in the
session.
The BTP futures contract fell from 94.90 to a low of 93.65 on fears that Mr
Giulio Amato, the prime minister, would be forced to resign, and the lira
weakened against the D-Mark, forcing the Bank of Italy to intervene and
support the currency.
As news emerged that Mr Amato would not be resigning, the market picked up
again and recovered some of its losses but fell back again in after-hours
trading on the news that Mr Franco Reviglio, the finance minister, was being
investigated in the country's political corruption probe.
GERMAN government bonds dropped back as statements from two Bundesbank
officials yesterday led the market to fear the central bank may not allow a
substantial cut in interest rates soon.
Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, said in a television interview
inflation remained a worry for the central bank and that the inflation rate
must be brought down to 2 per cent in the medium term. Mr Helmut Hesse,
another board member, said a small rate cut was possible, but not a big rate
signal.
The bund futures contract opened at 95.75, reached a high of 95.89, and then
slipped back to 95.58 by late afternoon. Volume was relatively light.
Dealers said the market was focusing on this week's repo in the hope the
Bundesbank would allocate funds at a lower rate. In last week's tender, the
lowest rate was 8.25 per cent.
THE strength of the French franc against the D-Mark continued to provide
firm support for the French government bond market which closed about a  1/4
point higher yesterday.
UK government bonds closed higher with the 20-year area outperforming the
rest of the market as dealers noted some buying interest ahead of today's
gilt auction.
The Bank of England will auction Pounds 3bn of 8 per cent treasury stock due
2013 today. Longer-dated gilts gained about  3/8 of a point yesterday as
dealers noted buying of stocks of a similar maturity. US Treasury bond
prices were mixed across the maturity range yesterday after an early rally
on news of weaker consumer confid-ence had failed to take hold.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year issue was down  1/4 at 102, to yield
6.908 per cent, while the two-year was up  3/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 3.891
per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds recovered most of Monday's losses yesterday, with
the futures contract bouncing back to end at 108.75, against the previous
day's 107.93 close.
Dealers said the market started firmly, with the June futures contract
opening at 108.30, then gained strength. The yield on the benchmark No 145
opened at 4.245 per cent and closed at 4.2 per cent.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Equities: Repsol sets price for global
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPSOL, the Spanish energy group, last night said it had set the price of
its global share offering at Pta2,735, a share, yesterday's closing price in
Madrid, and would sell another 35m shares, or 11.7 per cent of the company,
to take the government's stake to below 50 per cent from 54.4 per cent.
Repsol has been privatised gradually since 1989.
In New York, Goldman Sachs said the price of American depository shares in
the offering had been set at Dollars 23.68.
The equity offering, which has an unusually large international portion of
around 85 per cent, is expected to raise nearly Dollars 1bn for Repsol.
Investment bankers involved in the offering said an additional 5m shares
were likely to be made available for market stabilisation purposes.
If the global offering is increased to 40m shares, the total amount raised
through the partial privatisation would be close to Dollars 1bn. Few other
global share offerings, with exception of Telmex and New Zealand Telecom,
have had such a large international tranche. Goldman Sachs is global
co-ordinator.
Separately, Argentaria, the big state-owned Spanish banking corporation, has
filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) in New York.
This confirms that Argentaria will be placing up to 31.3m shares - or 24.9
per cent of its equity - on the market and that the US tranche will be led
by Morgan Stanley, with S. G. Warburg, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs as
co-managers. Morgan Stanley is global co-ordinator.
Argentaria's share offering, which could raise as much as Dollars 1bn, will
be aimed predominantly at Spanish institutional and retail investors. As
much as 40 per cent will be offered outside Spain.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: OMLX plans trade in both
securities and derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LYNTON Jones, chief executive of OM London, the Swedish-owned equity
options exchange, yesterday outlined an ambitious programme for broadening
the scope of the exchange to include securities as well as derivative
products.
The exchange 'is well placed to capitalise on the coming together of cash
and derivative markets', Mr Jones said, as it has the technical capacity as
well as regulatory approval as a recognised investment exchange in the UK.
As a first step, it changed its name, effective today, to OMLX, The London
Securities and Derivatives Exchange. But the drive to establish itself as an
international equity-based exchange trading both securities and derivatives
is likely to be difficult.
in an increasingly competitive trading environment.
The most radical plan is to resurrect the Unlisted Securities Market (USM),
a market for small UK stocks, using the exchange's sophisticated computer
trading system.
The London Stock Exchange (LSE), which has recommended phasing out the USM
by 1995, is studying responses to its consultative document on the USM and
is expected to make a statement soon.
The City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) plans to produce its own
recommendation by the end of May.
But Mr Jones also called for a transfer of responsibility for listing stocks
from the LSE to an independent body such as the Securities and Investments
Board. This would be closer to the system in the US, where companies have to
register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and would improve the
chances of success for a new unlisted securities market.
The other area of securities trading targeted by OMLX is the Swedish stock
market. International trading in Swedish shares is concentrated on Seaq
International. But, with a strong international base in Swedish equity
options trading, OMLX is considering offering a rival service.
In the derivatives area, the exchange plans to diversify its contract base
through linkages with other exchanges, a process already underway, and by
developing new derivative contracts. But it will avoid competing directly
with Liffe. OMLX may try to fill some of the gaps left by Liffe's products,
such as long-dated options, or flavour-of-the-month options - identifying
stocks currently of interest due to bids or takeover battles.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Inchcape's Pounds 125m convertible
performs strongly

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market picked up yesterday, after a quiet start to
the week.
In the sterling convertible bond market, a Pounds 125m issue for Inchcape,
the UK-based motor and business services group, performed strongly,
reflecting enthusiastic demand from continental European investors.
The latest in a steady flow of sterling convertible offerings, the more
aggressive pricing on the Inchcape deal proved acceptable to the market,
reflecting the strength of interest among equity, rather than bond,
investors. The coupon on the 15-year bonds was set at 6 1/4 per cent, half a
point less than for recent convertible offerings, while the conversion
premium was set at a fairly hefty 18 per cent.
Lead-manager Credit Suisse First Boston said that demand from continental
European investors for UK equity products reflected positive sentiment on
sterling, as well as on the UK economy.
The timing of the deal took advantage of the group's strong results,
including a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, announced on Monday.
Meanwhile, a Pounds 218m deal for the European Investment Bank in the
sterling fixed-rate bond market met a tougher reception. The five-year deal
was considered aggressively priced, although the nominal spread of 20 basis
points over the five-year gilt yield did not look unreasonable. The deal was
the latest in a series of issues in the sector to take advantage of the
shape of the gilt yield curve, by pricing a new issue which matures at the
end of 1998 over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due March 1998. Because of the
shape of the yield curve, the discrepancy in maturity effectively adds 10
basis points to the yield spread. However, retail investors have often
proved not to be sensitive to such devises.
However, in this case, the deal was widely felt to be too aggressively
priced, and the timing ahead of today's gilt auction was felt to be rather
risky.
Lead-manager J P Morgan admitted the pricing was on the tight side, but said
the deal offered value compared with other issues, such as the World Bank's
five-year bonds, trading at 17 basis points over the comparable gilt.
Electrolux, the Swedish white goods manufacturer, was yesterday downgraded
by Moody's, the US ratings agency, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in
Stockholm. The senior debt rating is cut to Baa2 from A3,
The move, which affects Dollars 1.3bn of long-term debt, reflects concern
about Electrolux's high debt levels, its long-term competitive position, and
its prospects for achieving improved financial results when its key European
markets are going into decline.

first half

MALBAK, the industrial arm of South Africa's Gencor group, increased
earnings by 12 per cent to R170m (Dollars 53.6m) for the first half to
February, from R152m a year earlier.
The company said that the country's difficult political environment and
ongoing recession continued to dampen demand in most areas of its business.
As a result, turnover rose by 9 per cent - less than the rate of inflation -
to R5.39bn from R4.96bn, with operating income 8 per cent up at R388m,
compared with R360m.
Lower gross margins were offset by productivity improvements and working
capital efficiencies.
Lower interest charges were largely neutralised by a higher tax charge,
leaving attributable earnings 12 per cent up at R170m, compared with R152m.
Earnings per share were only 1 per cent higher at 55.5 cents, against 55.1
cents, owing to a larger number of shares in issue. The interim dividend was
maintained at 12.5 cents a share.
Mr Grant Thomas, chairman, said all the group's seven divisions - food,
packaging and paper, healthcare, branded consumer products, international,
investments and corporate - had performed solidly.
The two largest contributors to earnings - 19 and 17 per cent respectively -
were food and packaging and paper. Both increased earnings despite declining
volumes.
Further progress was made in the reorganisation and rationalisation of SA
Druggists, which resulted in considerably improved profits, albeit off a low
base.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: McIlwraith attracts ADollars
82.3m bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCILWRAITH McEacharn, the Australian transport and resources group,
yesterday welcomed a ADollars 1.95-per-share takeover offer from Cyprus
Australia Coal, a subsidiary of Cyprus Minerals of the US.
Mr Tony Lawrence, chairman, advised shareholders to take no immediate
action, but said Cyprus would be 'a suitable parent company for McIlwraith'.
The bid values the group at ADollars 82.3m (USDollars 59.2m).
Cyprus said its aim was to secure control of McIlwraith's 40 per cent stake
in Oakbridge, a New South Wales coal producer co-owned by Tomen Corporation
and Nippon Oil of Japan.
An agreement between the shareholders gives McIlwraith a majority on the
board of Oakbridge and the right to appoint the chairman. Oakbridge, which
has a market capitalisation of about ADollars 220m, made a net profit of
ADollars 5m last year.
Analysts said the bid was likely to prove attractive to TNT, the troubled
Australian transport group which owns 46 per cent of McIlwraith. TNT has
been seeking a buyer for its McIlwraith stake.
The offer is pitched at a premium of 25 per cent to McIlwraith's pre-bid
share price of ADollars 1.55. However, the shares were trading at ADollars
1.40 before bid speculation pushed up the price on Monday.
The bid depends on 90 per cent acceptance by shareholders and approval by
the Foreign Investment Review Board, which vets most takeover offers
involving overseas companies.
Other conditions require the Oakbridge share agreement to remain unchanged,
and the retention by Oakbridge of all assets valued at more than ADollars
2m.

<TEXT>
BALTICA HOLDING, the troubled Danish insurance and financial services group,
yesterday reported a DKr4.4bn (Dollars 699m) net loss for 1992 and said it
would change its name and sell off all assets for the best price it could
get, Reuter reports from Copenhagen.
Baltica Holding last week announced a restructuring plan, under which it
divorced itself from its healthy Baltica Forsikring insurance unit.
A statement with Baltica Holding's annual result confirmed a widespread
belief that the purpose of the holding company would now be to wind up all
remaining assets and operations for the benefit of shareholders and
creditors. The statement said the holding company and all units other than
Baltica Forsikring would be given new names at the group's annual meeting in
late April.
It said the new holding company's aim was to 'divest its activities at a
time and price which are deemed most suitable from a financial point of
view'.
Its remaining units include Baltica Bank, finance company Baltica Finans and
brokerage firm Baltica Boers.
Baltica Holding said its net losses included DKr1bn in unrealised share
portfolio losses and DKr3.2bn in the real estate sector.
Baltica Holding said its own capital had shrunk to DKr2.97bn at the end of
1992, against DKR7.4bn a year earlier, when the group made a modest DKr128m
profit.
Baltica Holding has suffered a string of disastrous real estate projects,
including an offices and hotel complex in Gibraltar and the refurbishment of
Denmark's national soccer stadium, Parken.

SINGAPORE Land, one of the city state's biggest quoted property companies,
has announced pre-tax profits of SDollars 97.4m (USDollars 59m) for 1992, a
62 per cent increase on the previous year's SDollars 60.3m.
Singapore Land owns some of Singapore's prime office properties, with four
buildings accounting for about 6 per cent of the total private sector office
space available.
Associated companies own other commercial properties and have a 50 per cent
interest in three five-star hotels.
Singapore Land's turnover improved to SDollars 152.8m from SDollars 138.4m.
The company benefited from improved rental income as well as lower interest
expenses.
Singapore Land is a subsidiary of United Industrial Corporation (UIC), one
of Singapore's biggest listed companies in which Mr Liem Sioe Liong, the
Indonesian-Chinese businessman, has a controlling stake.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japan bids farewell to a trading
house with a long tradition - Itoman was faced with a difficult choice when
bankruptcy or merger loomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Itoman sign outside the Japanese trading house will be unceremoniously
hauled away and the bubble era's best-known victim formally bid farewell
tonight at a 'Sayonara Itoman' party, when the company lapel badge will be
worn for the last time.
At the stroke of midnight, Itoman will be absorbed by Sumikin Bussan, a
metals trader and member of the Sumitomo group, which has rescued the
trading house, once famed for opening Asian textile markets and now better
known for dire speculation in stocks and French Impressionist paintings.
Itoman had the choice of bankruptcy or a humbling takeover by Sumikin, which
is half its size. The collapse of Itoman, which had Y1,300bn (Dollars
11.12bn) in outstanding debt, would have undermined confidence in the
Japanese financial system. But the rescue meant that the scandal-tainted
Itoman name would be buried, alongside the reputations of recently-departed
executives.
'We either kept the name and lost the business or lost the business and kept
the name,' explained Mr Shigetaka Fujii, head of textile operations and a
director of Itoman. 'Of course, a lot of people felt very strongly about the
change of name, but I was in favour. I still think we have a bright future.'
Founded in 1883 as a fabric dealer by Mansuke Ito, whose descendants still
have links with the company, Itoman began importing cloth from Britain in
1891 and opened businesses in occupied China during the early 1940s.
Diversification into foods and industrial machinery were a success, but more
recent excursions into golf courses and finance were a disaster.
The demise of Itoman is blamed on Mr Yoshihiko Kawamura, dismissed as
president in 1991 and awaiting trial on charges of breach of trust, which he
denies. Impatient with the slow growth of textile and foodstuff sales, Mr
Kawamura turned Itoman into a property developer and art collector, paying
inflated, bubble-era prices in 1989 for assets still an embarrassment to the
group.
Unwise investment was bad enough, but the 1,340 employees were more
distressed by reports that the company had cultivated links with underworld
figures. At the height of the scandal, a director committed suicide, and Mr
Kawamura held out for two months against calls for his resignation. He then
became the first president of a listed company to be sacked since 1982.
The company's name was so stained that Sumitomo Bank was forced to mount a
very public support campaign to ensure that other lenders would not call in
their loans and force Itoman's collapse. A new management launched a
restructuring.
Sumitomo Bank had come to the rescue for the second time. It supported the
trader in the mid-1970s, when the textiles business turned sour, and the
relationship indicated to clients that Itoman was Sumitomo-backed. Some
misguided clients even regarded the company as an investment arm of the
bank.
The bank says it was nothing more than a typical Japanese bank, providing
some but not all needed funds and maintaining a small stake in the trader,
3.2 per cent at the close of the last financial year. However, 13 of
Itoman's 47 executives in 1990 had transferred from the bank, including Mr
Kawamura, who had been a managing director.
Mr Fujii, 55, was not one of the Sumitomo old-boy set. He has been in the
textiles trade for 30 years, and will remain head of the trading house's
textile business. He is confident the grafting of Itoman on to Sumikin
Bussan will make for a more interesting, if less risky business.
But Japanese mergers can be messy. The strict hierarchy of the promotion
system is often not flexible enough to cope with a sudden rush of fresh
employees. Managers are wary of each other, jealously guarding old territory
and concerned by the disruption to a carefully-planned career path.
Mr Fujii says the lack of overlap between textiles and metals will be an
advantage: 'We are lucky that our businesses are different, and we will be
able to help each other.'
At that moment, a message was broadcast over the Itoman intercom system,
asking employees to go to the information office to collect a fresh brochure
about their new company. The introduction makes no mention of Itoman, and
the textiles businesses are described as if they have always been run by
Sumikin Bussan.
A time-chart, at the back of the brochure and in small print, hardly does
justice to tradition of the trading house that is twice Sumikin's age. It
says no more than '1993 - merger with Itoman'.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Delta pilots' union seeks
justification for lay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNION representing pilots at Delta Air Lines, one of the big three US
carriers, said yesterday it wanted to 'validate' the need to lay off 600
pilots as result of the airline's 'fleet simplification' plan. Delta
announced the furloughs - its first temporary lay-offs of permanent staff
for 36 years - on Monday.
'We think the numbers are on the high side,' said the Air Line Pilots'
Association. But Alpa added that, if the lay-offs were shown to be justified
on economic grounds, it would be willing to resume talks with management
over a wage concession package.
When the airline announced the planned furloughs, Mr Ron Allen, Delta
chairman, stressed that they should be seen as part of a 'fleet
simplification' plan. But the move was interpreted as a shot across the bows
of the pilots' union. Pilots are the only unionised labour group at Delta
and the one group which has so far failed to agree a package of wage cuts.
The fleet simplification plan, Delta said, would involve the retirement of
some Airbus A310 aircraft, which the company took over from the now-defunct
Pan Am in 1991, and of some Boeing 727s.
Delta said these moves rendered 600 pilots surplus, including a number of
former Pan Am pilots.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: New IBM chief to be paid Dollars
2m plus incentives
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO

<TEXT>
MR LOUIS Gerstner, who was officially elected chairman of International
Business Machines by the computer company's board of directors yesterday,
will receive a salary of Dollars 2m for 1993, plus an annual incentive
payment of Dollars 1.5m tied to IBM's business performance, the company
said.
Mr Gerstner, who takes up his post as IBM chairman and chief executive
tomorrow, may also earn an additional bonus of Dollars 500,000, linked to
IBM's performance over the next three years. The compensation package was
fattened by a Dollars 5m one-off payment to offset the value of stock
options and other benefits that Mr Gerstner has forfeited by leaving RJR
Nabisco.
At IBM, he will be given options to purchase up to 500,000 shares at the
current average market rate.
Mr Gerstner's pay is substantially higher than that of his predecessor, Mr
John Akers, who earned Dollars 1.3m last year in salary and bonuses, down
from Dollars 1.58m in 1991 and roughly half of what he received in 1990,
according to the company proxy statement sent to shareholders earlier this
month.
Mr Akers' salary was also linked to the financial performance of IBM, which
reported net losses of Dollars 4.97bn for 1992.
When he joined RJR Nabisco in 1989, Mr Gerstner received a one-off payment
of Dollars 14.5m. His basic salary of Dollars 975,000 a year was guaranteed
to rise by at least 6 per cent a year. He also earned a guaranteed minimum
bonus, which brought his total annual income to Dollars 2.3m in 1989, rising
to Dollars 3m in 1992.
Mr Gerstner's stock options covered the right to purchase about Dollars 5m
worth of RJR shares, some for as little as 1 cent a share.
IBM has launched a new version of its top-selling software program that
signals the company's continuing shift toward supporting networked computer
systems and away from centralised mainframe-based systems. The Customer
Information Control System OS/2 version 2 enables transaction-processing
applications to be run on networks of PCs, workstations, minicomputers and
mainframes.

international expansion

<TEXT>
SAKS Fifth Avenue, the upmarket department store group bought in 1990 by
Investcorp, an Arab-led investment consortium, said yesterday it could
expand into Hawaii within a couple of years and use this as a stepping-stone
to the Far East.
The international expansion hints came as Saks announced that Kamehameha
Schools/Bishop Estate, a private charitable trust set up with the aim of
educating Hawaiian children, had acquired a 5 per cent interest in Saks.
Yesterday, Mr Philip Miller, Saks' chief operating officer, said the
relationship would facilitate Saks' expansion into the state, possibly by
autumn 1995 or spring of 1996, and might then help the retailer to move into
the Far East generally.
It has stated that international expansion was part of its five-year plan,
with the Far East, Mexico and Europe all possible markets.
Saks has been privately-owned since Investcorp's Dollars 1.5bn leveraged
acquisition of the retail chain from Britain's BAT group.
But Investcorp recently pumped another Dollars 300m of new equity into the
US retailer, and has since been placing out part of that commitment.
Earlier this year, it announced that an 11 per cent equity interest had been
sold to Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, chairman of United Saudi Commercial Bank
for Dollars 100m.
The Hawaiian trust is understood to have paid approximately half that sum
for its 5 per cent inter-est.
The trust was established in 1884 after the death of Princess Bernice Pavahi
Bishopa, great granddaughter of Hawaii's King Kamehameha I, and is invested
mainly in property in the Hawaiian islands. Its portfolio takes in ownership
of some prime shopping centres.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Apple, Honeywell in cockpit deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Macintosh personal computers will find their way into the cockpits of
commercial aircraft as a result of an agreement reached between Apple and
Honeywell's Commercial Flight Systems Group.
Under the deal, Honeywell will develop an 'electronic library' for use by
flight crews, providing 'multi-media' versions of maintenance and operation
manuals that incorporate video, graphics and sound as well as text.
Honeywell will also make a 'ruggedised' version of Apple's
recently-introduced Macintosh Quadra 800 high-performance PC for the cockpit
information system.
The agreement marks the first time that Apple has licensed its Macintosh
computer technology under such an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement
and signals a new strategy by Apple to broaden the markets for its
technology.
Honeywell said it plans to provide its airline customers with an easy-to-use
information system. The cockpit Macintosh computers will also be able to run
standard PC software.
'This provides airborne software application compatibility with computer
systems on the ground, and should help to incorporate more fully the
aircraft into an airline's overall information management system,' said Mr
Mark Anderson, Honeywell's lead engineer for the ELS project.
The agreement with Honeywell is the first to be reached by a new group
formed at Apple. Called 'New Media/New Markets,' the group will focus on
opportunities created by the convergence of the publishing, entertainment,
telecommunications, computing and consumer electronics businesses, Apple
said.
'Apple believes Macintosh personal computing technology can add great value
outside the realm of the traditional personal computer market,' said Mr Fred
Forsyth, senior vice-president and general manager of the Macintosh Systems
Division.' In particular, Apple is targeting areas such as retail,
automotive, transportation, medical imaging and aviation.

IBM has launched a new version of its top-selling software program that
signals the company's continuing shift toward supporting networked computer
systems and away from centralised mainframe-based systems.
The new software, Customer Information Control System (Cics) OS/2 version 2,
enables companies, such as banks and retailers, to run transaction
processing applications on networks of personal computers, workstations,
minicomputers and mainframes.
Cics - known colloquially among IBM computer users as 'covered in chocolate
sauce' - is a program that provides reports on customer activity.
The new version is aimed at computer users who are shifting such functions
off mainframe computers on to network servers, such as IBM's PS/2 PCs. It
was developed at the company's Hursley Laboratory in the UK.
A significant feature of the new version of Cics OS/2 is that it is aimed at
multi-vendor networks of PCs and servers running different operating
systems, including Microsoft's popular Windows program as well as IBM's OS/2
.
IBM also announced it was working with Apple Computer to develop software
that will enable Apple Macintosh PCs to be used on Cics networks.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNION representing pilots at Delta Air Lines, one of the big three US
carriers, is pulling out of wage concession talks with management, according
to reports out of New York yesterday.
The pilots' move followed the airline's announcement it planned to lay-off
up to 600 pilots.
'We made a promise that if they announced a furlough we would step away from
the table. We are pulling away from negotiations and trying to deal with the
furlough,' said Mr Steve Johnson, a Delta pilot and spokesman for the Air
Line Pilots Association.
There was no immediate confirmation of this stance from Alpa's Washington
office.
Delta Air Lines announced the planned lay-offs, the first the carrier has
implemented in 36 years, on Monday afternoon.
Mr Ron Allen, Delta chairman, sought to place the lay-offs in the context of
a 'fleet simplification' plan, although the move was widely interpreted as a
shot across the pilots union's bows.
The fleet simplification plan, Delta said, would involve the retirement of
21 A310 aircraft which the company took over when it acquired assets  -
including major transatlantic routes - from the now-defunct Pan Am in 1991.
However, Delta will accept nine new A310s which it has on order, and the net
loss of 12 A310s will help to accommodate a reduction in the carrier's
transatlantic schedules next autumn.
The carrier is also planning to retire 16 Boeing 727 aircraft, most of which
are employed on the east coast 'shuttle' routes. They will be replaced on
these routes by newer 727s from elsewhere in the domestic network. The
aircraft retirements represent a 3 per cent reduction in transatlantic
capacity, and a 1 per cent reduction for the group overall.
Mr Ron Allen, Delta chairman, denied the staff cutbacks were related to the
carrier's long-running dispute with the union. Pilots are the only employees
at Delta who are unionised, and the one group which has stood out against
the request for wage cuts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK Hapoalim, Israel's largest bank, yesterday reported a 66 per cent
increase in net earnings to Shk247m (Dollars 88m) for 1992 from Shk148m.
This rise was due to a sharp increase in income from non-banking activities,
such as brokerage, underwriting, foreign trade and foreign currency
operations. Hapoalim was the leading underwriter on the Tel Aviv stock
exchange last year, with 21 new issues amounting to over Dollars 400m.
Like other Israeli banks, Hapoalim was forced to narrow its financial
margins in 1992 in response to central bank pressure to lower interest rates
on loans to the public.
Another factor behind the advance was a decrease in bad debt provisions.
Previously one of the largest lenders to the country's troubled collective
and semi-collective farms, Hapoalim had been forced to make massive
write-offs on their account in recent years.
Consolidated assets totalled Shk94.14bn at the end of 1992, a rise of 1.6
per cent over the previous year's Shk92.65bn. Loans to the public were
Shk46.26bn, compared with Shk43.5bn, while deposits from the public were
Shk54.75bn, against Shk54.15bn.
Shareholders' equity rose 7.4 per cent to Shk3.81bn from Shk3.55bn; net
return on equity was 7 per cent, against 4.4 per cent last time.

CITIC Australia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Beijing's most important
investment vehicle, the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation, plans to buy 10 per cent of Yaohan International, the big
Japanese retailer.
Citic Australia is acquiring a stake in Yaohan from Mr Kazuo Wada, its
chairman and largest shareholder, who built the company into a large
international retail chain.
Yaohan, which owns stores spread across Asia, America and Europe, recently
opened one in Beijing. The shop is located directly opposite Citic's Beijing
headquarters.
Yaohan said it had ambitious plans to expand in China.
Citic Australia, whose interests include a USDollars 70m investment in an
aluminium smelter in Victoria, the southern Australian state, is emerging as
an aggressive investor internationally.
The Chinese parent company was founded in 1979 to promote the country's
business links with the outside world. It was headed by Mr Rong Yiren,
China's best-known millionaire, who was appointed the country's
vice-president at the weekend.
Citic's directors announced yesterday that Mr Rong would be stepping down as
chairman to allow him to concentrate on his state responsibilities.

LA RINASCENTE, Italy's biggest retailing group, which is controlled by Fiat,
raised net profits before minority interests slightly to L102.2bn (Dollars
63.5m) last year, from L100.9bn in 1991.
Mr Giuseppe Tramontana, managing director, said the increase was significant
in view of the substantial improvement in the quality of earnings, with
fewer extraordinary items and higher profits from the core business.
Profits before extraordinaries rose to L98bn from L72.4bn in 1991.
Rinascente, which raised sales by 9.7 per cent to L5,040bn, marked the
improvement in its earnings with a L10 a share dividend increase to L190 for
ordinary shares and L250 for savings stock.
The company has been the subject of widespread takeover speculation, but Mr
Tramontana said he was not aware of any negotiations for a sale.
Rinascente has spent heavily on new stores, particularly out-of-town
shopping centres, to boost sales. This year's plans envisage 20 new stores,
further expanding the chain from 743 units at the end of last year.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz blazes a trail in
US - David Waller on the group's plans to obtain a listing on the NYSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past six weeks, Daimler-Benz and the US Securities and Exchange
Commission have hammered out an agreement which is likely to have profound
implications for some of the world's largest companies - and for the world's
largest capital market.
The agreement means that Daimler, Germany's biggest industrial company with
sales approaching DM100bn (Dollars 61.4m) in 1992, will later this year
become the first German company to obtain a full listing on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Mr Hung Tran, head of DB Research, the research arm of Deutsche Bank, said:
'The move will give (Daimler) direct access to the world's biggest capital
pool - helping them to diversify their sources of capital at a time of
increasing global competition for capital.'
Mr Gerhard Liener, finance director of Daimler-Benz, said yesterday that the
the company decided to 'go it alone' towards the end of last year. The move,
he said, was a recognition that the company's shareholder base must be
reoriented to reflect the growing internationalisation of the group's
business.
'We were on the way to becoming a global company and I began to realise that
I might have been caught in an anachronistic way of thinking,' Mr Liener
said yesterday. 'Just as English has become the language of international
business, Anglo-Saxon accounting has become the accounting language
worldwide. I thought it was foolish to go on trying to play Don Quixote
tilting at windmills.'
He says he met with flexibility on the side of the SEC. 'A similar process
of rethinking was underway there, too. They were afraid that (without
European companies) that the New York market would fall back from being the
world leader and become provincial.'
Although Daimler made the bulk of the concessions in its negotiations with
the SEC, the US agency displayed some flexibility of its own.
It did not insist that Daimler provide a full US-style accounting of its
earnings for the three years prior to 1992. Mr Richard Breeden, the SEC
chairman, said yesterday that the agency had agreed 'that it was not
necessary for the company to incur inordinate costs to develop every detail
of information with respect to prior years' financial statements' as
normally required under US accounting procedures.
Mr Liener argues that much of the accounting adjustment will be relatively
painless. Group accounts - rather than those prepared by the German holding
company and four main operating units - already comply to a large extent
with US accounting rules. The DM4bn released from 'hidden reserves' will not
affect the group accounts and 'will not be used to pay dividends'.
More detail will have to be given more often, he says. Goodwill of DM4bn on
acquisitions will have to be written off against the profit and loss
account, but as the amortisation period is likely to be 40 years, the impact
will not be drastic.

<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics engineering group, is to
restructure its nuclear power business.
A factory at Bergisch Gladbach will be closed, accounting for 930 of the
1,100 jobs scheduled to go in the nuclear sector. A further 700 jobs will be
cut elsewhere in the group's power generation and distribution arm, KWU.
Siemens' nuclear division, which last year contributed around DM1bn (Dollars
600m) to KWU's DM6.6bn turnover, is to be split into nine independent profit
centres.
'We must continually improve our cost situation, the better to resist
international competition in the long-term,' said Mr Adolf Huttl, the
Siemens main board director responsible for KWU.
Dresdner Bank yesterday announced an unchanged DM12-a-share dividend for
1992 and a DM350 price for its planned two-for-19 share issue, Reuter
reports.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cost reductions help Ciba
advance 19% to SFr1.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIBA, the Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals group formerly known as
Ciba-Geigy, yesterday reported post-tax profits for 1992 up 19 per cent to
SFr1.52bn (Dollars 1bn) from SFr1.28bn.
The results, in marked contrast with the poor results at the German
chemicals companies, were achieved on sales up 5 per cent to SFr22.2bn from
SFr21bn.
Mr Alex Krauer, chairman, said he expected turnover and profits to increase
this year in spite of the poor environment, due mostly to cost reduction and
a switch to international accounting standards.
He warned that sales during the first quarter would fall compared with the
same period last year when Habitrol, a successful smoking cessation product,
had been launched.
The group's rate of sales and profits growth during 1993 would be less than
last year, he added.
Most of last year's profit increase was due to restructuring, said Mr
Krauer. The company was half-way through a three-year programme, launched in
1991, aimed at reducing costs in relation to sales by 3 percentage points.
Turnover at the industrial division increased 3 per cent on a currency
adjusted basis to SFr8.72bn from SFr8.45bn. Operating profits rose 51 per
cent to SFr527m from SFr349m, due to restruct-uring and low raw material
prices.
Customer focus and productivity improvements had generated most of the
profits growth in the industrial division, said Mr Heini Lippuner, chief
operating officer.
Pigments sales increased 11 per cent to SFr1bn, with printing inks and
automotive products generating substantial growth. Healthcare sales rose 12
per cent on a currency adjusted basis to SFr8.66bn from SFr7.8bn. Operating
profits improved 3 per cent to SFr1.285bn from SFr1.253bn.
Mr Pierre Douaze, head of pharmaceuticals, said the high costs of production
for Habitrol and pricing pressure had led to only a modest profits increase.
Mr Lippuner said the company was looking to expand its over-the-counter
non-prescription drugs business in the US.
Sales at the agricultural division, the world's largest agrochemicals
business, rose 1 per cent on a currency adjusted basis to SFr4.817bn from
SFr4.798bn. Turnover in the US increased 10 per cent.
Unfavourable weather and the effects of the reform of the EC's common
agricultural policy hit trading profits, which fell 3 per cent to SFr493m
from SFr507m.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: BP, Enichem say styrene venture
on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP CHEMICALS of the UK and EniChem, the Italian state chemicals group,
yesterday said negotiations to set up a joint venture in styrenes, announced
last August, had reached a 'final stage' and the new company should become
operational by the second half of this year.
The new venture, as yet unnamed, will probably be based in Brussels. With
annual output of around 700,000 tonnes of styrene monomers and a similar
amount of styrene polymers - equivalent to 22 per cent of European capacity
 -the company will rank equally with BASF as Europe's biggest producer and
will be one of the world's top five manufacturers.
Mr Demetrio Corradi, chairman of Enichem polymers, will be the venture's
chief executive. He will be supported by two general managers, one from BP,
the other from Enichem.
The operation will have five production sites in the UK, Italy, France,
Belgium and Hungary. At two sites, where EniChem has existing joint ventures
with other chemicals groups, the Italian company will pool its share of the
plant with BP.
BP said it had not yet been decided whether there would be a rationalisation
of products. However, nothing was sacrosanct and nothing was targeted, it
added. The new venture excludes an existing EniChem plant in Hong Kong, and
a planned facility in Tunisia, though these may be brought in later.
The new company will have annual sales of around L1,000bn (Dollars 622m).

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Carrefour sale raises FFr1.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARREFOUR, the French hypermarkets group, yesterday raised FFr1.8bn (Dollars
326m) by selling its 28.8 per cent stake in Castorama, one of France's
largest do-it-yourself retailers.
The placing, which was arranged by Kleinwort Benson Securities in London and
Banque Paribas in Paris, involved selling 3.45m shares in Castorama at
FFr550 each to institutional investors.
Carrefour's shares yesterday fell in Paris by FFr47 to FFr2,686 on the news,
while Castorama's shares, which are quoted in Lyon, rose by FFr7 to FFr575.
The sale of the Castorama stake is part of Carrefour's new consolidation
strategy, which has been pursued since Mr Jacques Fournier took over as
chairman last September, following the resignation of Mr Michel Bon,
architect of the group's expansion in the 1980s.
The proceeds of the Castorama placing will be used to reduce debt. Kleinwort
Benson said Carrefour's gearing should fall by 20 percentage points, to
between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. Earlier this month, the company
announced an 11 per cent rise in net profits to FFr1.33bn for 1992.
Castorama, which recently disclosed a 21 per cent rise in net profits to
FFr292m on sales of FFr12.2bn for 1992, is controlled by the Dubois family.
Its statutes include special provisions to protect it from hostile takeover
bids.

LINDE, the diversified German engineering company, reported 'satisfactory
results' for 1992, with group sales increasing 9 per cent to DM7.5bn
(Dollars 4.6bn).
The group's pre-tax profits for the financial year ending December 31 1992
rose to DM530, up from DM528m in 1991.
Net profits stood at DM254m, up from DM252m the year before. The group said
it would propose an unchanged dividend of DM15 per share.
In the group's biggest division, material handling, turnover rose by 7.7 per
cent to DM3,7bn.
Orders for 1992 stood at DM4bn, up 8.3 per cent from the previous year.
Investment climbed to DM730m, up from DM711m the year before.
The company said 1992 results were below expectations. The company blamed
the falling value of the UK, Italian and Spanish currencies as well as a
downturn in the domestic market for the weak result.

FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney considers plan to
ease debt burden

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, the leisure group that has incurred heavy losses since opening
the EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris last April, plans to try to
alleviate its difficulties by restructuring its finances.
Mr Robert Forsgren, finance director, said the group was 'doing a lot of
thinking and considering a number of different options' to reduce the cost
of servicing its FFr18bn (Dollars 3.2bn) net debt.
Euro Disney, which on Monday announced it had attracted 10m visitors to
EuroDisneyland since the opening, pays fixed interest rates on FFr8.5bn of
its debt and floating rates on the remaining FFr9.5bn.
Interest payments have been significantly higher than the group forecast
because of the unexpectedly high level of French interest rates. Bank base
rates in France are now 10 per cent, with inflation running at an annualised
rate of just over 2 per cent. Mr Forsgren said Euro Disney was making
additional interest payments of FFr200m a year.
Although French interest rates are expected to fall, Mr Forsgren said the
group was still keen to renegotiate the terms of its debt repayments.
Euro Disney, which made a pre-tax loss of FFr339m in its last full financial
year to September 30 and lost FFr492m in the first quarter of the current
year, has confirmed that it will stay in the red for the full financial
year.
Mr Forsgren said the company expected to reduce its losses next year, but
that he 'could not predict' the outcome thereafter.
Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in
London, expects Euro Disney to produce a loss of FFr650m in the second
quarter of this year and a profit of FFr375m in the second half, reducing
its projected loss for the full financial year to FFr769m.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Electronics side behind 14% rise to Pounds
16.6m at TT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT GROUP, the fast growing electronics and industrial holding company,
yesterday reported a 14 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 16.6m pre-tax
for the 12 months ended December 26.
The figures were helped, in particular, by an improving performance from the
Crystalate subsidiary, which makes electronic components.
The group also signalled that before making further acquisitions it would
ensure the profitable turnround of AB Electronic, acquired in January.
Turnover improved 8 per cent to Pounds 171m (Pounds 158m). Interest charges
declined from Pounds 3.23m to Pounds 2.8m reflecting the downward trend in
rates.
Earnings per share increased 11 per cent to 16.8p (15.1p); to beat Budget
changes on advance corporation tax the group is paying a second interim
dividend of 3.6p in lieu of a final, making a 6p (5.5p) total.
Mr Timothy Reed, chairman, noted that the group managed to achieve further
growth in both pre-tax profits and earnings 'despite one of the most
difficult economic periods of the last few decades.'
During the year, the core electronics and industrial division showed the
strongest growth with profits rising from Pounds 7.83m to Pounds 10.3m,
mainly as a result of the improved showing from Crystalate, acquired in
August 1990.
The acquisition of AB Electronic reinforced the group's focus on the
electronics sector. As a result of the purchase, about 80 per cent of group
turnover during the current year was expected to come from electronics
activities.
AB, with turnover of Pounds 180m a year, remains unprofitable although Mr
John Newman, TT executive director, said many cost savings have already been
achieved and the priority is to return it to profitability 'as soon as
possible.'
The acquisition was not expected to dilute group earnings this year and
should make 'a significant contribution' in future years.
Elsewhere, packaging showed a slight decline with profits of Pounds 8.07m
(Pounds 8.36m) while profits in the building services division dipped to
Pounds 1.12m (Pounds 1.67m).
COMMENT
TT's profits have risen for six consecutive years, no mean achievement given
the fact that more than 70 per cent of its business is UK-based. Over the
past two years the management team has made a number of key acquisitions in
the electronics sector culminating in the purchase of AB in January. Last
year's profits were boosted by the Crystalate business acquired two years
ago, and the management is confident that it can do the same for AB at least
as quickly. For the moment, however, further acquisitions are ruled out. The
share price has jumped from a low of 178p in December to 254p yesterday.
With pre-tax profits of Pounds 19m possible this year and earnings of about
18.2p per share, the shares are trading on a reasonable prospective p/e of
just under 14.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Nestor-BNA down 20% and buys agency chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NESTOR-BNA, the nursing agency group, recorded a drop in pre-tax profits in
1992 to Pounds 4.2m. The 1991 figure was Pounds 5.3m, after an exceptional
charge of Pounds 840,000.
The group also took an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.5m relating to its
near-20 per cent stake in Nutri/System (UK), the weight loss business now
being closed down. As a result there was a retained loss of Pounds 1.7m
(profit Pounds 1.9m).
Nestor-BNA also announced the acquisition of a 15-branch nursing agency
chain from Bupa, the private health insurance group. The purchase was for
Pounds 2.2m including taking on debt of Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Clive Chapman, finance director, said the deal raised gearing from 180
per cent at the year end - when net debt was Pounds 13.2m - to about 300 per
cent because of a goodwill write off as well as the extra debt. There will
also be restructuring costs involved in integrating the business.
Group turnover fell 4 per cent to Pounds 96.3m (Pounds 100.5m) and operating
profits fell 28 per cent to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 7.7m). All six divisions
were in profit but only the UK nursing agencies and the doctors deputising
service showed an increase.
Interest took Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.5m). Earnings per share were 4.3p
(5.81p). The proposed final is held at 2p to give a maintained total of
3.15p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD THOMPSON, the London market insurance broker, increased pre-tax
profits 23 per cent to Pounds 8.2m in the six months to December 31, despite
what Mr Peter Lloyd, chairman, described as 'very difficult market
conditions'.
The interim dividend goes up 21 per cent, from 1.65p to 2p, payable from
earnings ahead 23 per cent to 7.02p (5.7p).
Volume continued to increase, with turnover up 15 per cent from Pounds 17.1m
to Pounds 19.7m. Mr Lloyd said that the growth in volume had led to higher
cash balances, which offset the effect of falling interest rates on
investment income, unchanged at Pounds 3.1m.
In the wholesale marine business, higher premiums were frequently offset by
lower demand, as companies decided to shoulder more risks for themselves.
Insurance markets for North American business were 'soft', Mr Lloyd said.
Reinsurance business rose 28 per cent, from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 6.8m.

Rhino Group, the USM-quoted merchandiser and distributor of novelty
products, returned to profits in 1992, after two years of losses.
The turnround, from a pre-tax loss of Pounds 89,000 to a profit of Pounds
154,000, was only a partial recovery, but Mr Bev Ripley, chairman, was
confident about the outcome for the current year and directors are looking
for an early return to the dividend list.
Turnover rose from Pounds 3.34m to Pounds 4.81m and operating profits more
than doubled to Pounds 162,000. Earnings per share worked through at 0.45p

Mr John Burton, chairman, said the advance, which came from turnover up
Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 19.7m, was due to the significantly reduced interest
burden, down from Pounds 314,000 to Pounds 130,000.
Earnings per share worked through at 14.1p (13.8p) and a proposed final

Mr Burton also announced that he would be standing down as chairman after

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks hit by setback in final
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWMAN TONKS Group, Europe's largest architectural hardware concern, saw
pre-tax profits slide in the last part of the 1992 year and returned Pounds
13.2m for the 14 months to December 31 against Pounds 15.1m for the year to
end-October 1991.
Sales amounted to Pounds 266.5m, compared with Pounds 222m, but the group
incurred losses in November and December reflecting seasonal factors.
Net profits of Pounds 8.59m, down from Pounds 10.9m, were nearly wiped out
by extraordinary charges of Pounds 8.3m caused by the closure in the UK,
Belgium and the US of businesses whose future depends on the gloomy
new-build sector of the construction industry.
The closures were part of two years of rationalisation, which saw 8 per cent
of the workforce depart in 1990-91 and a further 10 per cent in 1991-92,
taking the employment roll down to 4,600.
'The actions we have taken over the last two years have reduced our cost
base and improved our competitiveness. We have paid the heavy cost of these
actions. The bulk of the resulting increase in profitability has yet to come
through,' said Mr Doug Rogers, chairman.
Earnings per share emerged at 6.5p, against 9.56p last time.
The group has maintained its dividend with an already declared second
interim of 5.5p making a total of 9.3p. No final distribution is proposed.
The dividend cost Pounds 12.4m, resulting in a Pounds 12.2m transfer from
reserves.
Over the last year the group has been consolidating, looking for future
growth by strengthening existing companies rather than by acquisition, the
case in the late 1980s.
Capital investment last year was Pounds 10m, 20 per cent more than the year
before.
After the seasonal losses, trading conditions improved markedly.
Sales were 20 per cent higher in January and February than over the same
months of 1992, according to Mr Geoff Gahan, chief executive.
The group has been trading well in Germany, where a new product range has
just been introduced and has found US demand growing steadily. The UK market
has stopped declining.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURN STEWART Distillers, the Scotch whisky producer, reported a first half
of 'difficult trading' with persistent pressure on prices in both UK and
export markets.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 increased 7.5 per cent to
Pounds 4.3m due to a halving of interest charges to Pounds 700,000.
Higher volume sales pushed turnover to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 19.4m) but
operating profit declined from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 5m as a result of lower
average prices.
Volume sales of bulk whisky increased some 18 per cent but prices were 7.9
per cent lower; bottled sales rose 11.1 per cent but prices declined 1.6 per
cent.
Mr Bill Thornton, chairman, said: 'The pressure on pricing which was evident
last year has continued into 1993 and will remain a major issue throughout
this year.'
Earnings per share fell from 6.1p to 4.9p due to the issue of new shares at
the time of the company's flotation in November 1991.
A maiden interim dividend of 1.7p is declared.
The value of the company's whisky stocks increased from Pounds 41.8m to
Pounds 54.4m with a significant purchase of matured whiskies to meet
forecast requirements.
Export initiatives were being pursued in the US and China, and new
distribution arrangements were now in place for the company's brands in a
number of other countries.

to IPounds 25m on turnover up 45 per cent to IPounds 831.4m for the year

The main expansion was in the meat division, where the acquisition of 10 new

Some 36 per cent of group turnover, and 30 per cent of operating profits now

Earnings were 12.11p (10.83p) and a final dividend of 1.85p makes a 3.3p

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dash blamed for Pounds 1m Alexon loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS IT warned in January, Alexon Group, the women's wear retailer, lost
nearly Pounds 1m before tax last year and passed its final dividend.
It slid to a Pounds 986,000 loss in the 53 weeks to January 30 from an
Pounds 11.3m profit in the previous 52 weeks. Sales declined from Pounds
114.2m to Pounds 107.8m. Worst affected was the Dash casualwear chain, which
fell into losses.
With cash conservation paramount this year, no interim dividend is expected.
Mr Lawrence Snyder, chairman, said the group had renegotiated its banking
facilities after a trebling of net debt from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 23m and a
breaching of covenants. Borrowings, which had all been short term, had been
switched to three years and the facility expanded. The rise in debt followed
an increase in stock to Pounds 44.7m (Pounds 41.4m), about Pounds 8m more
than in January 1991, and tax and dividend payments of about Pounds 9m.
Operating profit fell from Pounds 12.6m to less than Pounds 2m, which failed
to cover interest charges of Pounds 2.05m. Reorganisation costs amounted to
Pounds 910,000.
Profits made by Eastex women's wear, the one success story, were more than
offset by Dash's losses.
Dash was badly affected by reduced consumer spending and undermined by
cheaper look-alike products.
Winter clearance had continued into this month and the spring range launched
later than usual.
Alexon made a negligible profit on sales down 5-6 per cent. Progress was
made in the relatively small Continental business.
Losses were 12.15p (earnings of 23p). The passing of the final dividend
leaves shareholders with 3p (10.6p) for the year.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brake Bros ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAKE BROS, a supplier of frozen and chilled foods to the catering trade,
increased pre-tax profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 16m last year - helped by
steady margins in its core businesses and a sharp rise in sales.
Mr Frank Brake, managing director, attributed the group's success in
supplying a generally depressed catering trade to the investment in training
and service.
'We continue to invest heavily in people,' Mr Brake said. 'That is probably
why we have outperformed others in the recession.'
The group reported a 26 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 280.5m.
However, excluding acquisitions and the newly developed fine foods division,
sales were ahead 10 per cent.
Mr Brake said the company's main frozen foods business - which claims some
19 per cent of the Pounds 1.3bn UK market - had maintained its margins.
Further benefits were expected in this operation from the integration of
acquisitions made in 1991 and investments in distribution facilities
completed in 1992.
A second interim dividend of 4.35p in lieu of a final, to beat Budget
changes on ACT, makes a 6.2p (5.75p) total.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Heavy trading in HIS shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was heavy trade in Hambros Insurance Services, the newly-floated
financial services division of Hambros Bank, on its first day of dealings
yesterday, writes John Authers.
Total volume of 15m made it at one point the third most heavily traded share
on the market. Some of this may have reflected sales of small holdings in
the offer, which was oversubscribed 3.9 times.
The share price only registered a rise of 4.3 per cent, from 138p to 144p,
which showed that the issue had been well priced.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel shares fall on rolling stock
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Eurotunnel fell by more than 3 per cent yesterday
following reports of further problems in rolling stock production because of
a dispute over costs.
It is the latest in a series of rows over who should pay for the soaring
cost of the project which since 1987 has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to over
Pounds 9bn.
According to Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French
construction companies, production in Bruges of the single deck carriages
which will carry cars, coaches and caravans has been halted.
Problems have been caused by a dispute between Transmanche and Bombardier of
Canada, the rolling stock producer, over the rising cost of the wagons.
Production of double deck wagons at Valenciennes in France had also halted
because of a separate strike unconnected with Transmanche.
Eurotunnel shares fell from 492p to 473p. The share price previously had
risen sharply following the company's claims that it had won an important
victory in conflict over costs with Transmanche.
Eurotunnel has taken confidence from an International Chamber of Commerce
ruling that Transmanche could not pursue an all-embracing claim for extra
payments for fitting out the tunnel but would have justify individual
elements of the claim separately.
Transmanche said the decision will have little bearing on the outcome of its
claim to be paid Pounds 1.4bn in 1985 prices for works originally priced at
Pounds 620m. Eurotunnel has offered to pay Pounds 1.2bn of which Pounds 900m
would be cash and Pounds 300m in shares or quasi-equity.
Mr Jean-Claude Jammes, chairman of SAE, the French construction company and
a Transmanche shareholder, warned it would be impossible to meet
Eurotunnel's proposed opening date of December 15.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Avesco plans to demerge its Videologic
offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVESCO, the broadcast equipment and media services group, said yesterday
that it plans to spin-off its fast-growing Videologic multimedia and
computer graphics subsidiary.
The group also announced a 1-for-3 rights issue at 63p per share to raise a
net Pounds 12.1m.
The shares, which have risen sharply in recent months amid speculation about
Videologic, yesterday jumped another 13p to close at 98p.
Meanwhile, Avesco forecast that in the year which ends today it would report
a pre-tax loss of not more than Pounds 1.5m, including an unrealised
currency exchange loss of about Pounds 500,000, compared to a Pounds 2.3m
pre-tax loss a year ago.
Avesco does not plan to pay a dividend this year.
The proceeds of the rights issue, underwritten by SG Warburg, will mainly be
used to reduce debt and provide additional working capital for Videologic
over the next nine months as it brings a string of new products to market.
In June Videologic formed an alliance with IBM to design and develop high
volume multimedia products for personal computers - products combining text,
audio, graphics and video.
Ten new products are currently under development, including those Videologic
is developing for itself.
Mr Richard Murray, chairman, said Avesco plans to demerge Videologic once
the commercial success of the new products to be launched by the company
this year is clearer and 'as soon as is practically possible.'
In the interim he said the group plans to strengthen Videologic's senior
management including appointing a finance director together with a chief
executive for its US operations
The demerger, to be accomplished by giving existing Avesco shareholders new
shares in Videologic together with a floatation either in the UK or US, is
designed to provide Videologic with the flexibility to secure financing for
its longer term growth.
Since acquiring Videologic four years ago for Pounds 6m Avesco has invested
another Pounds 6.6m in the subsidiary, swallowing up most of the funds
available for investment within the group.
Over the past five years Videologic's turnover has grown at a compound rate
of over 40 per cent and overseas sales now account for 75 per cent of its
total revenues.
Yesterday Avesco forecast that the subsidiary would record turnover of not
less than Pounds 10.4m in the year to March 31, an increase of 44 per cent
over last year's Pounds 7.2m.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dash blamed for Pounds 1m Alexon loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS IT warned in January, Alexon Group, the women's wear retailer, lost
nearly Pounds 1m before tax last year and passed its final dividend.
It slid to a Pounds 986,000 loss in the 53 weeks to January 30 from an
Pounds 11.3m profit in the previous 52 weeks. Sales declined from Pounds
114.2m to Pounds 107.8m. Worst affected was the Dash casualwear chain, which
fell into losses.
With cash conservation paramount this year, no interim dividend is expected.
Mr Lawrence Snyder, chairman, said the group had renegotiated its banking
facilities after a trebling of net debt from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 23m and a
breaching of covenants. Borrowings, which had all been short term, had been
switched to three years and the facility expanded. The rise in debt followed
an increase in stock to Pounds 44.7m (Pounds 41.4m), about Pounds 8m more
than in January 1991, and tax and dividend payments of about Pounds 9m.
Mr Snyder said: 'Debt reduction is the priority.' He hoped gearing would
come down from 73 per cent to less than 50 per cent within two years. A
crucial factor would be destocking.
Operating profit fell from Pounds 12.6m to less than Pounds 2m, which failed
to cover interest charges of Pounds 2.05m. Reorganisation costs amounted to
Pounds 910,000.
Profits made by Eastex women's wear, the one success story, were more than
offset by Dash's losses.
Dash was badly affected by reduced consumer spending and undermined by
cheaper look-alike products. Mr Snyder said sales were 15 to 16 per cent
down and much less stock was sold at full price, depressing margins. Fixed
costs had risen, including rents by more than Pounds 1m.
Winter clearance had continued into this month and the spring range launched
later than usual. Although February/March sales were down, the trend was
improving. Prices on some basic items had been cut by 20 per cent.
Alexon made a negligible profit on sales down 5-6 per cent. Progress was
made in the relatively small continental business.
Losses were 12.15p (earnings of 23p). The passing of the final dividend
leaves shareholders with 3p (10.6p) for the year.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Avonmore shows 53% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New acquisitions gave a sharp boost to Avonmore Foods, the Irish dairy and
meat processing group, which reported a 53 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to IPounds 25m on turnover up 45 per cent to IPounds 831.4m for the year
ending January 2, writes Tim Coone.
The main expansion was in the meat division, where the acquisition of 10 new
processing facilities in Ireland, the UK and Germany boosted the division's
sales from IPounds 109m to IPounds 302m.
Some 36 per cent of group turnover, and 30 per cent of operating profits now
come from meat processing, said Mr Pat O'Neill, group managing director.
He said the IPounds 71.3m spent on acquisitions had 'substantially increased
the scale and strategic position of the business at an attractive entry
cost'.
Earnings per share were 12.11p (10.83p) and a final dividend of 1.85p makes
a total of 3.3p (3p). The company anticipates a turnover exceeding IPounds
1bn in 1993.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Restructured David Brown ready for market
with Pounds 90m price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID BROWN Group, the Huddersfield gear manufacturer with one of the most
famous names in British engineering, is to be floated with a market value of
Pounds 90.3m.
About 7.7m ordinary shares priced at 170p will be made available to the
public through an offer for sale, with a further 23.1m shares being placed
with institutions. All the shares have been underwritten by BZW, the
company's broker.
The group, which was losing money at the time of a Pounds 46m management
buy-in in 1990, has been restructured and last year made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 9.3m on sales of Pounds 81m.
The offer price represents a multiple of 12.1 times pro forma historic
earnings and a notional gross dividend yield of 4.7 per cent for the year to
January 29 1993.
The company's biggest business is vehicle transmissions, supplying both the
military and civil markets. It said work for the Challenger 2 battle tank
would provide stable work until 1997.
The Radicon division makes geared drives for the industrial market. The
group said it should be an early beneficiary of economic upturn.
The offer and placing will raise Pounds 52.4m, of which the company will
receive Pounds 20.1m, net of expenses. After paying off borrowings and
redeeming preference shares, the group wil have cash balances of Pounds 9m.
Mr Chris Cook and Mr Chris Brown, the joint chief executives who led the
buy-in, said the company would have up to Pounds 15m available for
acquisitions. They want to fill in product gaps and also extend the group's
sales and distribution network - particularly in continental Europe.
The closing date for share applications is next Tuesday. Dealings are
expected to begin on April 15.
COMMENT
In spite of some feeling that this management buy-in comes to the market
with unseemly haste, analysts considered the offer had been realistically
priced by BZW. The new management has taken a company and shaken it up after
after five generations of family ownership. The group's name and technical
reputation are well known, so it should benefit from economic upturn.
However, orders on the military side come unevenly, and Radicon's new
products are yet to prove themselves. A prospective multiple of about 11
puts it at a discount to other engineering stocks which are priced for
recovery. Not one for the stags perhaps, but the shares should attract
long-term investors with faith in British manufacturing.

Further benefits were expected in this operation from the integration of
acquisitions made in 1991 and investments in distribution facilities

The acquisition of a small chilled foods group in the UK and two food
distributors in France was behind the one percentage point drop in overall
margins.
Mr Brake said London Larder, the UK company, had incurred a Pounds 1m loss
and was not expected to contribute to profits until 1994.
Since the year-end, Brake Bros had paid Pounds 3m to add two companies to
the two French businesses acquired last year for Pounds 4m. The business was
expected to come into profit next year.
A second interim dividend of 4.35p in lieu of a final, to beat Budget
changes on ACT, makes a 6.2p (5.75p) total.

EBC Group, the West Country construction and development group, yesterday
unveiled pre-tax profits down from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 1.28m for 1992.
Recession severely affected all divisions but the private housing market has
been devastated, said Mr Bert Cockroft, chairman. The group intends to
achieve a complete withdrawal from housing activities 'as promptly as
conditions permit'. It made a Pounds 3.6m provision to cover consequent
losses.
Turnover fell to Pounds 53.6m (Pounds 59.9m). Earnings per share were
reduced to 9.35p (12.17p). A proposed final of 2.25p halves the total to 4p.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Macfarlane ahead 48%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENEFITS of a cost-cutting programme in 1991 helped Macfarlane Group
(Clansman), the Scottish packaging company, achieve record annual pre-tax
profits of Pounds 10.1m for 1992, an increase of 48 per cent.
Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman, said the rise reflected the 'many
painful measures which had to be taken . . . to ensure that our companies
became even more efficient and professional'.
A significant number of jobs had been cut and a squeeze put on stocks and
debtors.
The benefits continued in the current year with both sales and profits ahead
of the same period in 1992.
'Although there are few signs of indentifiable and sustainable growth,' Lord
Macfarlane said, 'I am convinced that the recession has now bottomed out.'
Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 87m.
Both the packaging division, which provides two thirds of profits, and the
plastics moulding business had performed successfully.
The proposed final dividend is increased from 2.49p to 2.9p, for a total 13
per cent higher at 4.78p. Earnings advanced by 47 per cent to 13.2p per
share.
Macfarlane also announced a 1-for-2 scrip issue.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Airtours sells 8.2% stake in Owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS yesterday signalled the end of its bitter bid battle for Owners
Abroad, selling its 8.2 per cent stake in its larger rival in the stock
market at a considerable loss.
Britain's third biggest tour operator built up the holding during the Pounds
290m hostile bid, paying between 144p and 150p per share.
Dealers said yesterday that the shares had been sold for 117p, which would
suggest a substantial loss. Smith New Court, the securities house, was
believed to have bought the 12.7m shares and placed them with institutional
shareholders.
Together with its shareholding, Airtours had acceptances of only 43 per cent
of Owners' shares when its offer closed on March 16. After the defeat, Mr
David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, said the company would 'be watching
developments at Owners Abroad closely.'
There was no one available for comment at either Airtours or Smith New Court
yesterday.
Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad, said: 'I am delighted that
Airtours has decided to dispose of its stake. Both companies can now get on
with the business of selling holidays.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: New loader range from Fermec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERMEC Holdings, the Manchester-based construction equipment company, today
launches a new range of backhoe loaders in a bid for second place in the
European market, led by another UK company, JC Bamford Excavators.
Fermec, better known by its MF Industrial brand name, was formed last
October by a management buy-out from Varity Corporation's Massey Ferguson
Group.
The launch is the most important in the company's history. Mr Richard
Robson, managing director, said the four new backhoes could have a dramatic
impact on the company, which has projected sales of Pounds 55m this year.
Fermec is currently the third biggest European producer of rigid backhoe
loaders, behind JCB with about 45 per cent of the market and Case with 20
per cent.
Mr Robson said MF Industrial's share of the 10,000 to 10,500 unit market had
risen by 3 percentage points to between 12 and 13 per cent since the
buy-out, and there was no reason why it could not rise to 20 per cent with
the new range.
The backhoes have taken four years and between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m to
develop, and could ultimately double the size of the company.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Delay for Mosaic relisting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOSAIC Investments, the West Midlands-based mini-conglomerate whose shares
have been suspended since last September, yesterday announced interim
results for the period to October 31 1992 and said it hoped to get its
shares relisted by the end of April.
Mosaic had previously said its shares should be relisted by today.
However, the complexity of discussions with bankers, Mr Rodney Day, the
holder of Pounds 3m worth of preference shares, and other vendors of
companies bought by Mosaic, have delayed the process. Worsening trading
conditions meant earlier agreements had to be renegotiated.
The interim results showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 207,000 (Pounds 3.2m).
The sale of the engineering and automotive division cut sales by Pounds 4.2m
and operating profits by Pounds 900,000 but boosted net assets from Pounds
7.3m to Pounds 10.5m.
Group sales fell from Pounds 25.8m to Pounds 18.3m, and operating profits
were Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 3.8m).
Exceptional costs of Pounds 583,000 related to redundancy and reorganisation
costs and more costs are expected in the second half because of the
relisting.
There was a Pounds 349,000 loss (loss Pounds 28,000) from the investment in
European Licensing Group, the associate.
The loss on the sale of the engineering and automotive business caused an
extraordinary debit of Pounds 2.8m.
Losses per share were 0.67p (earnings 12.8p).

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Croda shows 40% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRODA International, the specialty chemicals and coatings group, yesterday
reported a rebound in pre-tax profits from the depressed 1991 levels,
propelled by record results from its chemicals side.
Pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent last year to Pounds 29.8m against
Pounds 21.3m previously. Turnover grew by just 3 per cent to Pounds 362.9m
(Pounds 352.5m).
Earnings per share also rose by 40 per cent, to 15.3p (10.9p), and the
company, which cut its final dividend in 1991 from 6.9p to 4.75p, increased
it again to 5p making a total for the year of 7.75p (7.5p).
Mr Michael Valentine, chairman, said 'a significant recovery' had been
achieved, helped by the strong performance of the chemicals operation.
This contributed more than 82 per cent of the group's Pounds 37.5m trading
profits and produced a record result with an increase in sales of 8.7 per
cent to Pounds 240.1m, an improvement in trading margin to 12.8 per cent and
a trading profit increase of 40 per cent to Pounds 30.9m.
Mr Valentine suggested the advance reflected significant investments in new
chemicals plants and strengthening of group sales efforts in various parts
of the world.
In contrast, trading profits from the coatings sector were slightly lower at
Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 6.2m) on flat turnover of Pounds 84.1m (Pounds 85.7m).
The results reflected the continuing fiercely competitive conditions in the
industrial paint and printing ink markets, which have also been reduced in
size by recession in the UK and Australia.
Cosmetics and toiletries were badly affected by weak European consumer
demand. Trading profits fell to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 1.4m) on turnover of
Pounds 38.7m (Pounds 45.9m).
Geographically the US operations had 'an excellent year', while the Far East
was buoyant with a particularly strong advance in Singapore and a good
result from Japan. Australasia was patchy but improving, with good recovery
prospects in New Zealand offset by a mixed performance in Australia.
In continental Europe almost all of the group's operations were affected by
the worsening recession, while in the UK, in spite of continuing weak demand
in the domestic market, profitability increased sharply reflecting both good
export business and the effects of earlier cost cutting measures.
Despite the Pounds 7.6m cost of three small acquisitions, partly offest by
the Pounds 4.6m proceeds of the sale of the Manley Ratcliffe honey business,
together with Pounds 17m in capital expenditure last year, the group's end
year gearing declined from 38.5 per cent to 34.3 per cent.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Thames TV calls for share deal suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Thames Television, the independent production company, were
suspended yesterday at the company's request. An announcement is expected on
Thursday.
The suspension followed an FT report on talks about a possible acquisition
of Thames by Pearson, the publishing, oil services and investment banking
group. But 'other matters' are also involved, according to the company.
Before the suspension, Thames shares had risen to 221p, up from Monday's
189p close. The suspension price values Thames at Pounds 109.6m, a rise of
17 per cent since Monday's close. Pearson shares closed yesterday at 410p,
up 6p.
Thames said the shares had been suspended 'pending a further announcement
concerning this morning's press report of talks between Thorn EMI and
Pearson and other matters affecting Thames Television's financial results
for the year ended December 31 1992.'
Thorn EMI owns 58.9 per cent of Thames. In 1990, when Thames still held the
ITV weekday franchise for the London region, Thorn EMI and BET, which
between them held 56 per cent of Thames, put the combined stake for sale.
There were no takers, because of uncertainty over the outcome of the
imminent franchise auction. The two companies withdrew the shares from sale,
and Thorn EMI bought out BET in 1991.
Thames lost its franchise in the auction. Since then, it has become an
independent production house, selling its programmes to the ITV network and
other broadcasters. It also owns Reeves, a US production company, and has
stakes in the UK Gold channel and the Astra satellite.
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, said it was keen to expand in media
businesses, including television. It already owns 20 per cent of Yorkshire
Television and 17.5 per cent of BSkyB.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Airtours sells Owners stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS yesterday signalled the end of its bitter bid battle for Owners
Abroad, selling its 8.2 per cent stake in its larger rival in the stock
market at a considerable loss.
Britain's third biggest tour operator built up the holding during the Pounds
290m hostile bid, paying between 144p and 150p per share. Dealers said
yesterday that the shares had been sold for 117p, which would suggest a
substantial loss. Smith New Court, the securities house, was believed to
have bought the 12.7m shares and placed them with institutional
shareholders.
Together with its shareholding, Airtours had acceptances of only 43 per cent
of Owners shares when its offer closed on March 16. After the defeat, Mr
David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said the company would 'be watching
developments at Owners Abroad closely.' There was no one available for
comment at either Airtours or Smith New Court yesterday.
Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad, said: 'I am delighted that
Airtours has decided to dispose of its stake. Both companies can now get on
with the business of selling holidays.' He added that he was not worried
about the discount of the sale to Owners Abroad's current share price of
124p.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Psion's Pounds 1.4m falls below
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PSION, the manufacturer of hand held computers and data communications
equipment, disappointed the City with profits before tax of only Pounds 1.4m
against expectations of over Pounds 3m.
Analysts were mollified, however, by the return to profitability - it lost
Pounds 2.2m before tax last year - and by a 64 per cent increase in revenues
generated through organic growth.
The shares dipped 1p to 120p.
Turnover was Pounds 35.1m, compared with Pounds 21.3m, chiefly due to the
success of the Series 3 hand-held computer, successor to the Organiser.
Mr David Potter, founder and chairman, said some 103,000 units had been sold
to date. Sales of the Series 3 totalled Pounds 18.2m in 1992 compared with
Pounds 1.9m.
Earnings per share came to 4.33p against losses of 8.13p. A proposed final
dividend of 1.5p makes a total for the year of 2.5p (2.4p).
Psion, once among the cream of UK high technology stocks, has still to prove
it can fulfil its early promise. Gross profit margins last year were lower
than budget resulting in a less than satisfactory return on sales, Mr Potter
said.
Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m this year, equivalent
to earnings per share of 9p and a prospective multiple of 13.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Mayflower launches Pounds 35m rights to
fund expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAYFLOWER, the specialist UK engineering company, is raising Pounds 34.6m
through a 1-for-1 rights issue to finance its ambitious expansion programme
in the UK and US.
The issue, which has been fully underwritten by Smith New Court, will be
priced at 36p per share compared with a closing price on Monday of 49p. The
shares gained 3p yesterday to close at 52p.
Mayflower, which chiefly comprises Motor Panels, the automotive engineering
company which was acquired out of the receivership of CH Industrials in
1991, lifted pre-tax profits by 60 per cent in 1992 to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds
1.07m). The result was after an exceptional Pounds 1.7m largely relating to
Motor Panels' exposure to the collapse last month of Daf, the Anglo-Dutch
commercial vehicle maker. Leyland Daf, the UK subsidiary of Daf, owed Pounds
1.8m to Motor Panels, which supplies it with cabs.
It has resumed supplies to Leyland Daf against orders placed by the
receiver, and said yesterday that deliveries were running at about half of
the level of a year ago or 100-120 cabs a week.
The Motor Panels business in the UK and US is being expanded rapidly thanks
to several large contracts won recently or which are currently at an
advanced stage of negotiations:
Earlier this month Mayflower announced that it had won a contract to take
part in the development and manufacture of cabs for a new series of trucks
for Ford in the US which could be worth more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 211m)
over a 15-year period.
In the UK it has won the contract to supply more than 600 bodies a year for
the new Aston Martin DB7 sports car, which was unveiled at the Geneva motor
show earlier this month. The DB7 will go into production at Aston Martin
Oxford in April next year.
It is at an advanced stage of negotiations for a contract for the design,
development and supply of the body shell for a new specialist vehicle for
European markets. This project is understood to concern collaboration with
Rover in the development of a new MG sports car.
Mayflower said that it expected capital investment to jump from Pounds 3m in
1992 to about Pounds 23m this year, chiefly for the development of plants
and equipment in the UK and US.
In February it bought its first stamping plant in the US for Dollars 7.5m to
supply pressings to Motor Panels' US operat-ions, and said yesterday that a
further Dollars 12.5m would be spent to modernise the plant during the next
three years.
Mayflower turnover more than doubled last year to Pounds 67.8m (Pounds
27.4m).
Earnings per share came through at 1.41p (1.91p) and a final dividend of
0.85p is proposed for a 1.25p total.

Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, remained silent yesterday on
possible board changes to meet shareholder criticism following reduced
profits and false accounting at a subsidiary.
The board met on Monday and was likely to discuss the outcome with NM
Rothschild, its merchant bank, and Panmure Gordon, its broker, before making
an announcement.
The agenda included whether to part company with Mr Stuart Greenwood,
finance director. Other issues concerning shareholders are the role of Mr
Bill Rooney, effectively both chairman and chief executive, and the slow
progress towards appointing non-executive directors.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEYES, the manufacturer of hygiene and cleaning products, yesterday reported
a 33 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.6m for the year to
January 2.
Mr Jimmy Moir, managing director, said Jeyes had benefited from a
particularly sharp rise in the sales of moist toilet paper, hygienic wipes
and toilet cleaners.
Overall sales rose 45 per cent to Pounds 89.4m, of which Pounds 18.5m was
due to the acquisitions of Globol, a German air freshener and toiletries
manufacturer, and of Quickies, the wipes brand. Global contributed about
Pounds 500,000 to operating profits of Pounds 6.3m compared with Pounds
4.9m, with a further Pounds 250,000 coming from Quickies.
Mr Moir said the current year would be one of reorganisation and
consolidation. No large acquisitions were planned although the company had
its eye on a few bolt-on purchases.
The company had invested Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 2.7m) in capital expenditure.
The final dividend is a proposed 4.5p making a total of 7.6p (6.4p), payable
from earnings of 21.5p (18.5p) per share.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Tibbett &amp; Britten rises to Pounds 14.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIBBETT &amp; BRITTEN, the warehousing, transportation and distribution services
group, increased annual pre-tax profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 14.7m in
spite of what it described as 'difficult trading conditions everywhere.'
Sales rose 28 per cent to Pounds 231.8m in the year to December 31. The
group said 69 per cent of its growth was generated organically while 80 per
cent of revenue was contractually based.
Development was particularly strong in its consumer and personal products
divisions, with additional business from existing clients being reinforced
by the impact of new contracts won over the past two years.
Lowfield's grocery operations added new contracts and Tibbett &amp; Britten
Canada also grew. More modest development by the clothing and textiles
division reflected continuing difficulties in the sector.
In June, Tibbett paid Unilever Pounds 2m for SA Warehousing Services, which
distributes nationwide in South Africa for Unilever and other local and
international companies. The group said it had already provided a platform
for further development there. In November, Tibbett paid an initial Pounds
31.2m for Silcock Express, a private car distribution company.
Mr John Harvey, chairman, said profit margins continued to be held back by
investment in overseas developments and the difficulties of the
non-contracted Fashion Logistics operations in an extremely depressed
clothing sector. Margins were further impacted by the inclusion of Silcock's
December trading which added no profit, being a seasonally poor month.
Tibbett said it was financially robust and had generated strong operational
cashflow. After the 1-for-5 rights which raised Pounds 30.8m at the time of
the Silcock purchase, Tibbett had year-end net borrowings of Pounds 1m,
giving gearing of 1.4 per cent.
Mr Harvey said: 'In the medium term the group should benefit from recovery
in the clothing and motor sectors. More immediately, the recent acquisitions
should perform in line with expectations. All divisions are actively
tendering, reflecting opportunities arising from supply chain changes within
their established markets.'
Earnings per share rose 10.5 per cent to 27.3p (24.7p). A recommended final
dividend of 8.1p gives a total for the year of 11.9p (10.8p).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES BEFORE tax at Waterford Wedgwood, the luxury crystal and ceramics
manufacturer, increased from IPounds 2.7m to IPounds 17m for the 1992 year.
The figure was scored after taking account of higher-than-expected
exceptional provisions amounting to IPounds 18.4m (IPounds 5.3m).
Of the exceptionals IPounds 16.5m was for closure costs at four Wedgwood
plants in the UK and redundancy costs at three Waterford Crystal plants in
Ireland. IPounds 1.9m was attributable to property disposals.
Sales for the year fell from IPounds 292m to IPounds 274m but operating
profits held steady at IPounds 9.1m.
Losses per share rose from 0.73p to 2.69p.
Mr Richard Barnes, finance director, said the exceptional item included a
provision for planned ongoing redundancies in both divisions during 1993, of
which 'the cash impact is 80 per cent complete at Waterford and 50 per cent
complete at Wedgwood'.
He said no further capacity cuts were planned once the present
rationalisation process was concluded and added: 'The capacity in place is
appropriate for the demand today.'
The total workforce has been cut by 25 per cent to 7,500 since 1991.
Earlier this year, unions representing the 1,600-strong workforce at the
Waterford Crystal division agreed to a rescue plan involving a further 200
voluntary redundancies, pay cuts of up to 25 per cent, a three-year
no-strike agreement and a one-year moratorium on the outsourcing of new
lines of crystalware from mainland European manufacturers.
Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of the Waterford division, said that as a
result 'we are getting improved margins on all Waterford products'.
He said new products within the classic crystalware range were planned to
comprise 30 per cent of the sector's sales within a few years and would be
sourced outside of Ireland if they cannot be produced competitively enough
at home.
The successful Marquis range of stemware, introduced in 1991, is
manufactured in Germany and Slovenia.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Thames TV to make write-downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television, the independent production company, is expected to
announce tomorrow that it is making significant write-downs on the value of
Reeves Entertainment, its loss-making US subsidiary, and UK property.
The write-downs in a profitable trading year for Thames will clear the way
for a possible bid for the company from Pearson, the publishing, investment
banking and oil services group which owns the Financial Times.
Shares in Thames were suspended yesterday at the company's request, partly
because of an FT report on talks about a possible acquisition of Thames by
Pearson, but also because of the provisions which are expected to hit the
Thames share price.
Thames paid around Pounds 57m for Reeves but the company has never performed
as well as expected.
The property write-downs follow the loss of the Thames ITV franchise and the
fact that its Euston Road headquarters in London are now surplus to
requirements.
Before yesterday's suspension, Thames shares had risen to 221p, up from 189p
at Monday's close. The suspension price values Thames at Pounds 109.6m, a
rise of 17 per cent since Monday's close. Pearson shares closed yesterday at
410p, up 6p.
Thames announced that the shares had been suspended 'pending a further
announcement concerning this morning's press report of talks between Thorn
EMI and Pearson and other matters affecting Thames Television's financial
results for the year ended December 31 1992'.
Thorn EMI owns 58.9 per cent of Thames. In 1990, when Thames still held the
ITV weekday franchise for the London region, Thorn EMI and BET, which
between them held 56 per cent of Thames, put the combined stake for sale.
There were no takers, because of uncertainty over the outcome of the
imminent franchise auction.
The two companies withdrew the shares from sale, and Thorn EMI bought out
BET in 1991.
Thames lost its franchise in the auction. Since then, it has become an
independent production house, selling its programmes to the ITV network and
other broadcasters.
Pearson says it is keen to expand in media businesses, including television.
It already owns 20 per cent of Yorkshire Television and 17.5 per cent of
BSkyB.
Pearson started talking to Thames last year about the television company's
plan to bid for a new Channel 5 franchise.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Daimler-Benz to list in Singapore and Shanghai after US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON, DAVID WALLER, TONY WALKER and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, FRANKFURT, PEKING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ intends next year to seek a stock-exchange listing of its
shares in Singapore, and possibly Shanghai, after reaching agreement with US
authorities about a listing in New York.
The plans for the listings were revealed in New York yesterday at a press
conference to announce Daimler's compromise with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission.
Mr Gerhard Liener, the group's finance director, said that the agreement on
accounting standards with the US authorities would lead directly to listings
of its stock on other exchanges worldwide. Daimler shares are already traded
in Tokyo.
Mr Liener said yesterday that the listing in New York would not be coupled
with the issue of new stock. Daimler's long-awaited rights issue would come
'probably next year', he said.
Daimler had intended to hold a DM2bn (Pounds 800m) rights issue in the
autumn of last year but this was postponed due to the poor state of the
stock market.
Mr Liener said yesterday that Daimler's net profit for 1991 would be 'just
under' DM1.5bn after DM1.9bn in 1991. This is in line with analysts'
expectations and reflects a sharp downturn in the group's core automobile
market. Full details are to be released next week.
Mr Liener said that turnover for 1992 would be DM98.5bn, up from DM95.01 in
1991. The dividend is to be maintained at 1991's DM13 per share.
The deal with the SEC means that Daimler's group accounts will in future be
produced accounting to US generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP).
This will mean common standards of valuation applied throughout the group,
and greater disclosure in areas such as cash flow statements.
Preparations for the listing in Shanghai's fledgling markets are at an early
stage but the intention underscores German industry's growing interest in
China.
Daimler is considering opening a bus assembly factory near Shanghai and
setting up a joint venture with a local company to make rolling stock for
underground railways. AEG, Daimler's electrical's subsidiary, is leader of a
German consortium which has built the first 14km of an underground railway
for Shanghai.
If Daimler joins the Shanghai stock exchange it will be sharing the register
with companies such as No. 1 Pencil, Fridge Compressor and Rubber Belt, Tony
Walker writes from Peking.
The exchange has a reputation as a roller coaster. In mid-1992 the B-share
index, the exchange's 10 dollar-denominated shares available to foreigners,
dropped 50 per cent before recovering some ground. Last week, it dropped 5
per cent, before rebounding.
Blazing a trail, page 28
Another two senior executives have quit Volkswagen, the German car group
which is Europe's leading vehicle maker, writes Christopher Parkes in
Frankfurt.
Mr Hans-Jorg Hungerland, a director in charge of world distribution of VW
brand vehicles, and Mr William Young, president of Volkswagen of America,
both left at their own request, the company said yesterday.
The moves follow the departure of three group main board directors and the
arrival of General Motors' former head of procurement, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Lord Hollick and Paul Foot leave the Daily Mirror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE uncertainty over the future of Mirror Group Newspapers intensified
yesterday with the resignation of two very different men - Lord Hollick, a
non-executive director, and Mr Paul Foot, long-standing Daily Mirror
columnist.
Both personified the traditional links between Mirror Group Newspapers and
support for the Labour Party.
Last month Lord Hollick, the Labour peer and chief executive of MAI, the
financial services and television company, found himself in a minority of
one on the MGN board.
Lord Hollick said then that he could not support fully the view of his
fellow directors. The board had backed the policy of Mr David Montgomery,
the chief executive.
Yesterday he said in a statement: 'I have for several months voiced my
concerns about a number of governance and policy matters which I believe to
be important to the long-term commercial and editorial success of Mirror
Group Newspapers.'
He added: 'Unfortunately it has not been possible to resolve these matters
and I have therefore tendered my resignation. I wish MGN every success.'
Lord Hollick was not immediately available for any further comment but it is
believed he was concerned about the editorial independence of the paper, the
strength of its commitment to Labour, the number of journalists hired from
Today - which Mr Montgomery used to edit - and the way Mirror staff have
been treated.
He is also concerned about the effect that a weakening of the paper's
traditional links with Labour could have on its business prospects. The
Mirror's political stance has usually been seen as an important part of its
appeal to readers.
Mr Foot, the award-winning journalist who last week tried unsuccessfully to
publish a column critical of Daily Mirror management, said in a letter to Mr
David Banks, the Daily Mirror editor, that his position had become
impossible.
After Mr Foot handed out copies of his unpublished page in the street
outside the Daily Mirror building last week Mr Banks issued a statement
saying Mr Foot should take sick leave to rest.
The Mirror editor said yesterday Mr Foot had done the honourable thing and
that he would be replaced this week.
Sir Robert Clark, the MGN chairman said last night that it was not
surprising that Lord Hollick had decided to resign since he was unable to
support the position of the board.
'Good corporate governance was observed to the highest standards and in all
respects at Mirror Group,' Sir Robert said.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Zeneca set for rights issue as part of ICI demerger:
Pharmaceutical business to enter international arena with New York Stock
Exchange listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer currently
working towards a demerger of its Zeneca pharmaceutical business, has set
the timetable for the deal which includes a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue by
Zeneca.
Although ICI and Zeneca stress that the priority in the rights issue is that
it should be a normal domestic issue - preserving pre-emption rights and
raising capital for Zeneca on suitable terms - they are also believed to be
keen to take the opportunity to put Zeneca into the international arena.
Only about 5 per cent of ICI's shares are held in the US.
Zeneca will go for a New York Stock Exchange listing and will register the
rights in the US so that investors there can take them up.
Between the issue of the pathfinder prospectus and the pricing on May 12,
Zeneca will be marketing the issue to its leading institutional investors.
After that there will be roadshows in Europe and the US to raise the profile
of the new company with large international investors.
Mr John Mayo, the former corporate financier who is to be Zeneca's finance
director, said: 'We do not have an ambitious target of transforming the
share register overnight. The medium-term strategy is to have a share
register which reflects the international nature of the business.'
This marketing effort could lead to a scheme to 'recycle' the rights shares.
A syndicate could be formed to find buyers outside the existing share
register to mop up any loose stock in the market after dealings start on
June 1.
Similar 'recycling' arrangements have been added to rights issues by other
companies, such as Time Warner, the US publishing and entertainment group.
Typically they involve a dealer-manager buying rights shares in the market
to satisfy demand drummed up by a syndicate of brokers, who are then paid a
success fee.
Although the inclusion of such an element would not drive the pricing of the
issue, it could enable Zeneca to achieve a better price if underwriters knew
that there would be a concerted effort to find buyers for any unwanted
shares during the rights period.
Normally shares issued in a rights and not taken up by investors are placed
at the end of the rights period.
Zeneca has signed a deal with Amersham International, the UK health science
group, to co-promote Amersham's Metastron, a radiopharmaceutical treatment
for the relief of bone pain associated with prostatic cancer, writes Paul
Abrahams.
Zeneca will promote Metastron, which had sales last year of Pounds 2m, to
oncologists in all markets except Japan.
It has been launched in 10 markets, including Germany and the UK, but is
awaiting approval in the US. Amersham continues responsibility for
registration.
Dr Alistair Riddell, Amersham group marketing manager, said: 'We do not have
the funds or resources to drive this product. This constitutes a
considerable step forward.'

raise questions on newspaper's policy

THE uncertainty over the future of Mirror Group Newspapers intensified
yesterday with the resignation of two very different men - Lord Hollick, a
non-executive director, and Mr Paul Foot, long-standing Daily Mirror
columnist.
Both personified the traditional links between Mirror Group Newspapers and
support for the Labour Party and both had become increasingly isolated at
the popular newspaper group.
Last month Lord Hollick, the Labour peer and chief executive of MAI, the

Lord Hollick said then that he could not support fully the view of his
fellow directors. The board had backed the leadership of Mr David
Montgomery, the chief executive and the policies the company had been
pursuing.
The move seemed to represent a split between the Labour peer and Mr
Montgomery. The two had come to the company together to try to improve
efficiency and undo some of the financial damage left by its former
proprietor Mr Robert Maxwell.
Lord Hollick did not resign immediately because he was waiting to see
whether note was taken of any of his criticisms.
Yesterday he said in a statement: 'I have for several months voiced my
concerns about a number of governance and policy matters which I believe to
be important to the long-term commercial and editorial success of Mirror
Group Newspapers.'
He added: 'Unfortunately it has not been possible to resolve these matters

FT  31 MAR 93 / Isosceles's banks facelosses of Pounds 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK LENDERS to Isosceles face losses of up to Pounds 500m on their Pounds
1.09bn of loans to the owner of the UK Gateway supermarket chain which is
restructuring its debt.
Bankers said yesterday they were close to reaching agreement with other
Isosceles investors on the restructuring, which is likely to involve the
conversion of its bank loans and mezzanine, or subordinated, debt into five
new forms of debt and equity.
Slightly more than Pounds 500m of the bank loans is expected to be converted
into new debt held by Isosceles's Gateway subsidiary. The banks believe
Gateway can service this debt, and that they should not have to make loss
provisions against it.
However, after the restructuring, the banks will still hold around Pounds
140m of debt provided to the parent, Isosceles, plus some deep discounted
bonds, some preference shares and possibly some ordinary shares.
The value of the Isosceles debt is difficult to assess, bankers said. Most
are hopeful that the company will be able to make payments on it, but cannot
be certain. 'Some banks may make provisions to cover possible write-offs on
everything except the Gateway debt,' said a banker. Those provisions could
be as high as 50p for every Pounds 1 lent, he said.
Of the 38 Isosceles banks, Bank of Nova Scotia, the Canadian bank, has lent
around Pounds 80m. Midland Bank of the UK, Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce and Bank of Scotland are all thought to have provided around Pounds
70m each. Chemical Bank of the US lent less than Pounds 60m. Bank of
Scotland, which has to date avoided most of the high profile UK corporate
bankruptcies, is expected to make Isosceles provisions of at least Pounds
30m in its next financial results, due in May.
In the negotiations, General Electric Capital Corporation of the US has been
representing providers of Pounds 375m of mezzanine debt, which face huge
losses. They are likely to get none of the new Gateway debt, but around
Pounds 60m of the Isosceles debt, plus deep discounted bonds, preference
shares and ordinary shares.
GE Capital and Standard Chartered, the banking group, each hold more than
Pounds 100m of the mezzanine debt.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Analyst fined over insider deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Thorold Mackie, a Scottish investment analyst, was yesterday found guilty
of insider dealing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. He was fined Pounds
25,000.
The verdict, by a majority of the 15-member jury in Scotland's principal
court, shocked people in the Edinburgh financial community, where Mr Mackie
is a well-known figure.
The trial, which lasted seven days, concerned a profits warning by the
Glasgow-based waste disposal company Shanks &amp; McEwan. Mr Peter Runciman,
chairman of SME, had told the court that in September 1991 he informed Mr
Mackie in confidence that SME was shortly to issue a profits warning.
Mr Mackie was accused under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider Dealing)
Act of 'counselling and procuring' two salesmen at Bell Lawrie White, the
Edinburgh stockbrokers for which he worked, to deal in SME shares on behalf
of clients.
By selling ahead of the profits warning the shares realised Pounds 1.396m
more than they would have done after the warning was issued, the court
heard.
Mr Mackie had told the court that Mr Runciman did not mention a profits
warning at the meeting, but told him that there would be 'little by way of
growth in earnings per share' for SME in the current half year.
Temporary judge Sheriff Robin McEwan, QC, told Mr Mackie, 39, that 'insider
dealing was a modern creation which nevertheless has to be regarded
seriously. The probity of dealing on a public stock exchange and the
confidence of the public are of great importance in this country.'
He acknowledged that Mr Mackie's offence had not been committed for personal
gain, but as a consequence of it Bell Lawrie White had transacted business
for which it must have earned considerable fees.
In mitigation Mr Donald Macfadyen, QC, defending, said that Mr Mackie had
been suspended from membership of the Securities and Futures Authority when
he was charged a year ago.
This had prevented him from advising clients in a professional capacity, and
his membership was now likely to be terminated, he said.
Mr Mackie is understood to be considering an appeal.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Fresh obstacle prompts doubt on Maastricht bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH OBSTACLE brought renewed uncertainty to the passage of the bill to
ratify the Maastricht treaty yesterday, as the House of Commons was offered
a further opportunity to debate and vote on the social chapter.
The new debate will be on an amendment backed by the Labour leadership,
which could force the government to choose between accepting the social
chapter and being unable to ratify the treaty, after the Maastricht bill
itself had been passed.
The final dilemma for the government would arise only if Tory Euro-rebels
explicitly voted for the social chapter - which they do not support - as a
tactical move to try to wreck the treaty. But passing the new amendment
would cast a further shadow over the UK's ratification process.
Ministers also received two boosts yesterday, when the government narrowly
won a procedural motion enabling debate to continue into the small hours,
and when Mr Michael Morris, the MP who chairs the detailed committee
discussion of the bill, announced he had reversed his decision to allow a
vote on another social chapter amendment. An alliance of opposition MPs and
Tory rebels had been threatening an embarrassing defeat for the government
on the issue.
Although the government insisted that the amendment now ruled out could have
been passed without wrecking the treaty, defeat would have raised the
prospect of Tory rebels applying for judicial review of that legal opinion.
Mr Morris faced protests in the Commons from Labour and from Tory
Euro-sceptics at his decision not to allow the vote. The issue could be
raised again at a later stage.
The amendment which has been chosen would prevent powers being transferred
to European institutions under the legislation, until the Commons had
decided whether the social chapter should apply to the UK.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, and government legal officials
have yet to give a view, but Labour believes it would make a separate debate
and vote on the social chapter necessary once parliament had discussed the
Maastricht bill.
Ministers said yesterday that Mr Morris's decisions left the government
'roughly where we were before', but Mr George Robertson, Labour's European
spokesman, said that his party had gained a clear advantage.
The Liberal Democrats have signalled they would support the new amendment,
but Tory Euro-rebels gave a cool response. They held an emergency meeting
last night and their apparent immediate disarray may give the government
some comfort.

FT  31 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The end of the fiscal year today marks the start of a testing time for
Japanese equities. Higher share prices and a strong yen have helped banks
comfortably to meet their BIS capital ratios. According to the bear
argument, the passage of this important deadline will allow the authorities
to leave the equity market to fend for itself. The recent rally may thus
prove little more than an artificial end-year spike. Such worries, however,
look overdone, not least because the government has lasting reasons for
concern about the stock market.
One of them is its desire to shore up other parts of the financial sector,
notably life insurance companies whose solvency margins have been under
pressure. Another is its plan to privatise more of Japan's railway network.
Yet another is the need to maintain consumer confidence at a time of general
uncertainty about the impact of corporate restructuring.
By talking up NTT, the authorities have found a way of capturing the public
imagination as well as helping the market as a whole. After hints that NTT's
rate increases may be brought forward, the company's shares have risen some
50 per cent since the start of the year, dragging other high technology
stocks up in its wake. The market has become convinced that the government
is trying to engineer recovery based on technological renewal rather than
traditional pump priming. That thought may continue to underpin share prices
even if there will be a long wait before a turnround in earnings provides an
excuse for the market to go decisively higher.

FT  31 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Ciba
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With interests ranging across healthcare, agricultural and speciality
chemicals, Ciba bears a striking resemblance to Zeneca - the bio-science arm
of ICI - albeit on a grander scale. Higher profits and the optimistic note
struck by the Swiss yesterday, though, should not raise expectations about
what the men from Millbank can deliver. Tough conditions in pharmaceuticals
are no surprise. Ciba sees CAP reform depressing demand for agrochemicals
for three years at least. Although both companies are well out of
petrochemicals, specialities will hardly be buoyant while the German and
Japanese economies are moving down.
Both companies are also in the throes of restructuring, which should yield
cost benefits this year. But while Zeneca's first act as an independent
company will be to make a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, Ciba promises a one-off
boost to profits from the switch to international accounting standards.
Moving from current cost to historical cost valuations will reduce Ciba's
stated assets, resulting in a lower depreciation charge. Reported profits
should rise by up to 10 per cent as a result of this and other accounting
changes. There is also the thorny issue of hidden reserves - although Ciba
refuses to say how much, if anything, could be released.
Book-keeping changes are no substitute for real growth. That will only flow
from responsive management and productive research and development. With a
research budget twice that of Zeneca, and a stream of new drugs on the way,
Ciba looks well placed to pass the test.

FT  31 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Gilt complex
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England must have its fingers crossed that today's gilts auction
will go well. Not only is it the largest ever at Pounds 3bn; it is also the
first of the more frequent auctions promised since the Budget. Having chosen
to sell 20-year paper the Bank is reasonably certain of a respectable
outcome. Since the auction was announced, prices of such paper have fallen
by around 2 points. That will increase the auction's appeal to domestic
institutions which show signs of wanting to switch into longer-dated
holdings. But one successful auction will not solve the funding problem,
especially since it is unclear how much new money it will attract.
Ideally any shorter-dated paper sold by institutions to make room for the
auction stock should quickly be bought by others: foreign investors are
traditional buyers of 10-year paper, banks of short-dated gilts. An
important test of demand will be the ease with which this mopping up is
accomplished. There is room for doubt. Dwindling hopes of lower base rates
have eroded the attraction of short-dated gilts. The relative strength of
sterling leaves foreigners suspicious.
Overseas investors have been heavy buyers of Euro-sterling issues recently,
but these bonds habitually carry a substantial premium to gilts. At DM2.42
sterling has only limited room to appreciate, which makes gilts less
attractive at current yields. With today's auction the government has
avoided confronting this problem head on. It cannot do so indefinitely.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Danish PM wants more measures to encourage EC growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SELECTIVE EXPANSION of European Community economies to pull the EC out of
recession and cut its 17m jobless total was urged yesterday by Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Rasmussen, president of the EC
council, said he expected a Yes vote in Denmark's Maastricht referendum on
May 18. This would improve the EC's economic prospects by reducing general
uncertainty about the treaty's future.
Latest indications are that about 47 per cent would vote Yes, with 25 per
cent saying they are against and a substantial proportion of voters
undecided.
Mr Rasmussen said EC leaders should follow this up by agreeing further
growth measures at the Copenhagen summit in June, building on plans to
increase infrastructure investment decided at the EC summit in December. He
said: 'We have to provide a locomotive effect of the 12 (EC members) by
expanding our national economic policies in a selective manner.'
In line with Denmark's decision not to take part in the final stage of
economic and monetary union (Emu), he underlined his scepticism about some
longer term Maastricht goals. Mr Rasmussen, who took over at the helm of a
Social Democrat-led coalition in January, said: 'What we need is not to
discuss developments for the year 2000. I'm in favour of concrete decisions
concerning those 17m (unemployed) people in 1993-94 . . . We need decisions
to bring Europe out of stagnation and economic crisis.'
He said he particularly favoured increased investment in 'railways, roads,
harbours, cities and education' to expand the EC's December plans for higher
infrastructure lending by the European Investment Bank.
'If we do that together, we will exploit the dynamism of the single market,'
he said. Mr Rasmussen's ideas back up increasingly vigorous suggestions from
EC officials in Brussels that the Community puts greater emphasis on
combating the recession.
Asked about constraints posed by German monetary policy, Mr Rasmussen said
measures to allow non-inflationary expansion would help the Bundesbank
continue recent interest rate cuts. 'There's no contradiction between higher
economic growth and lower interest rates.'
Pointing out that EC growth this year was likely to be no more than 1 per
cent 'in the best case', he said: 'Stagnation in Europe is a disaster for
ordinary people.' He said his government would maintain the krone's parity
in the ERM despite Denmark's exemption from Emu.
But he said EC governments would have to accept short-run divergences from
the fiscal targets set down at Maastricht to guide the path to Emu.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Western creditors may soon reschedule Russian debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARIS CLUB of western creditors is expected in the next few days to
negotiate a much-delayed debt rescheduling with Russia, following an
agreement by Ukraine to give up claims on the assets of the former Soviet
Union.
Ukraine's refusal until now to let Russia, the richest former Soviet
republic, keep the assets and assume responsibility for all the liabilities
has been the main obstacle to a rescheduling of the former Soviet Union's
foreign debt of some Dollars 80bn (Pounds 56bn).
But it emerged yesterday that a weekend visit to Kiev by Mr Jean-Claude
Trichet, the secretary of the Paris Club, together with Ukrainian fears for
President Boris Yeltsin's political future, have convinced Ukraine to drop
its objections.
As part of the deal, Ukraine is to gain space in 36 formerly Soviet, now
Russian, embassies worldwide plus parts of the former Soviet Union's Danube
and Black Sea merchant fleets.
Western governments are anxious to show practical support for Russian
reformers before the April 25 referendum, which may determine the country's
political and economic direction. They are likely to try to clinch a debt
agreement with Russia quickly. A debt rescheduling would open the way for
fresh lending.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister for foreign economic
relations, said 'a radical restructuring' of the debt would secure 'an
essential breathing-space'.
Half the debt is owed to governments, while just over a third is owed to
commercial banks and the rest to suppliers. Russia has said it is prepared
to pay a total of Dollars 3.5bn to all creditors in 1993.
Mr Shokhin said the government intended to work out with creditors of the
former Soviet Union 'realistic agreements which would substantially lessen.
. . foreign indebtedness'.
Mr Jacques Attali, chairman of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, said in Moscow he believed it was 'folly' to ask Russia to pay
any of the Soviet debt. He wants western governments to compensate western
banks for debts incurred by the Soviet Union.
Mr Jean Foglizzo, head of the International Monetary Fund's mission in
Russia, said the west faced a 'historic choice' between short-term
assistance which was merely a 'derivative of humanitarian aid' and
assistance which prompted a 'virtuous circle' of self-generating growth.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Personal View: Shock therapy disguised as science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT J MCINTYRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reporting on the fate of the Yeltsin government has tended to propagate a
fundamentally false dichotomy between the democratic reform-minded president
and a conservative parliament, confusing the personal popularity of Boris
Yeltsin with support for the crucial elements of his marketisation and
privatisation programme. This obscures both the doubtful character of the
Russian president's commitment to democracy (a plebiscite to allow
strong-man rule, following a year of rule-by-decree, hardly suggests an
affection for democratic process) and the catastrophic character of much of
the economic policy pursued under his name.
Insistent and generally effective propaganda that there is no third way
denies that there is room for choice or any need for public discussion of
transition policy. While it is true that economic policy details are largely
entrusted to experts in normal economies, Russia is not a normal economy at
the moment.
The Yeltsin programme is constitutional-level social decision-making
disguised as the application of neutral economic science. Public discussion
of these policy choices is discouraged and arrangements for privatisation
are made exclusively by presidential decree, without parliamentary
influence. Under the banner of 'no more experiments', the wildest imaginable
social surgery is being performed without informed consent or anaesthesia.
The resulting 'shock therapy' has been an equal mixture of policy
incompetence and uncontrolled corruption, causing immense structural damage
of a particular type which has proved to be effectively irreversible in
eastern Germany. Regardless of political motive, this tactic destroys the
institutional bridges that could lead to a sustainable and socially
palatable future performance. It is the failure of the Yeltsin government to
deal with the core organisational and structural realities of economic
transition that should earn it contempt.
Popular support for such shock measures is virtually non-existent, and the
socialist model of entitlement and citizens' economic rights is deeply
rooted, despite popular hostility to the word 'socialism'. Foreign advisers
and Yeltsin administration economists talk of capitalism and privatisation
as indistinguishable means and ends; they present rapid privatisation as the
only path to achievement of the 'optimality' intrinsic to market capitalism;
and they presume broad support for their programme.
Unfortunately for the proponents of the Yeltsin programme, the widespread
assumption that the population enthusiastically awaits a recognisable form
of market capitalism has been largely based on a simple mistranslation -
privatisation being understood by ex-Soviet (and many eastern European)
respondents to mean 'no longer totally owned by the national-level
government'. The widespread citation in the Russian republic of the Kamaz
truck factory as an example of successful privatisation is vivid evidence of
this, since, as your reporting has made clear, it has literally no private
owners. Privatisation with zero ownership by private persons should be
called denationalisation or something else. Much reported popular support
for privatisation (beyond small shops and restaurants) has been based on
this semantic confusion.
As a result the shock reform programmes which are regularly applauded in the
west are only politically viable if the population is either bamboozled or
given no role in deciding what will happen. When local opinion is able to
have a significant effect on the privatisation process, reality moves far
from the assumptions of the free-market economists who currently dominate
national level decision-making.
While even uninformed resistance to a manifestly catastrophic policy
deserves some respect under these conditions, many of the positions of
parliamentary conservatives, especially the Civic Union group headed by
Arkady Volsky, represent a more coherent analysis of the realities of the
current situation than can be found in the government programme. Civic Union
correctly points out that without an integrated industrial transition
strategy, International Monetary Fund-style macro-level adjustment policies
create only ruins and not viable 'commercial' entities. The Yeltsin-Gaidar
programme simply will not work as the basis for either a sustainable
productive economy or a civilly peaceful society. Adoption of an unmodified
market economy as the goal, and its achievement by shock methods, will
require authoritarian methods, not just in the short run.

ONE MIGHT suppose that Denmark's EC partners would sympathise with its
desire to allow greater public access to the proceedings of the Council of
Ministers, in the hope of allaying the darker suspicions of Danish voters
before they decide the fate of the Maastricht treaty on May 18. But
apparently not. Danish proposals to broadcast three councils this month were
vetoed by other member states, and a decision is still pending on two more
scheduled for next week.
It is argued that opening up council debates will make them either purely
ceremonial or an occasion for political posturing, driving the real business
into other, more private, meetings. Why, it is asked, do not national
cabinets meet in public?
The analogy is false. The Council, though composed of national ministers, is
not a government but a legislature. Legislatures do not normally meet in
private. Indeed the publicity of parliamentary proceedings, finally
established in the 18th century, is considered a cornerstone of British
democracy.
Of course, legislators do not always tell the whole truth, and votes are
often the subject of private negotiations outside the chamber. But EC voters
and taxpayers are entitled to know how their representatives vote on
proposed legislation, and what reasons they give for it. It may be more
convenient for ministers to keep quiet on the matter, and later let 'the
Brussels bureaucracy' take the blame for unpopular directives. But if they
continue to behave like that they should not be surprised by public
disenchantment with the whole European enterprise.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Peace hopes in Bosnia, again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAVE been so many false dawns since the Bosnian conflict started a
year ago that the latest favourable indicators must be viewed with caution.
A cease-fire that has held for three days and the Bosnian president's
signature on an agreement which has yet to be endorsed by those mainly
responsible for the war in the first place, the Bosnian Serbs, do not add up
to a peace settlement. But there are signs that the prospects for a
negotiated peace agreement are no longer as hopeless as they were.
The main reason for a more optimistic view is the growing evidence that
international pressures are finally beginning to have an impact. The
mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, have always acted on the assumption
that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, is the puppet master who
must be persuaded to exert pressure on his Bosnian kinsmen if any progress
towards a peace settlement is to be made. Last January, it was Mr Milosevic
who twisted the arm of the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, to
accept the first part of the Vance-Owen peace plan, the constitutional
framework for Bosnia. Last week, it was again Mr Milosevic who masterminded
the ceasefire talks in Belgrade between the warring factions and the UN
commanders.
The Serbian president did not seem to apply the same pressure to Mr Karadzic
in the intervening period. But the tide turned when both the US, initially
highly sceptical of the Vance-Owen plan for a decentralised
Bosnia-Hercegovina of 10 semi-autonomous provinces, and Russia, appointed
their own envoys to the peace talks and gave their full backing to the plan.
That has had two main results. The US has been able to persuade an
increasingly recalcitrant Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian
president, to sign the provincial map, in New York last week. Probably, the
quid pro quo was an American undertaking to back the implementation of any
peace agreement with ground troops. The mediators' strategy of isolating Mr
Karadzic, so that the maximum international pressure could henceforth be
focused on him, has thus been realised.
The Russians, meanwhile, have been using their influence equally discreetly
with their traditional allies, the Serbs, so that they, in turn, would exert
pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. The meeting in Belgrade yesterday between Mr
Milosevic and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian envoy to the peace talks, was
part of that process.
It is possible, though by no means certain, that all this pressure will lead
to the approval by the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament within the next
two weeks of the Vance-Owen plan. That does not, of course, guarantee that
it would be faithfully implemented or remain viable in the longer run. To
have any chance of success, as the UN and Nato have realised, it would
require the presence of 50,000 to 70,000 troops for many years to police its
provisions. It is still far from certain that the international community is
prepared to make such an effort, though the opposition of governments to
participation in UN peace enforcement operations is less strong than it was.
The decisive argument in favour of the Vance-Owen plan is that, with all its
weaknesses, it remains the only game in town. Its strength, and advantage
over all other schemes, is that it has the backing of all the big powers. A
genuine attempt should therefore be made to make it work. The only
alternative is to accept a military fait accompli.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Leading Article: ACT revisited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS SEVERAL companies scramble to push through increased or accelerated
dividends following the Budget's changes to Advance Corporation Tax, but
ahead of the new tax year, there is a reminder once again of the distortion
which arises from the fondness of chancellors for producing complex
proposals from a battered red box.
In fact the proposed Foreign Income Dividend scheme is indeed to be the
subject of a consultative paper. But the more important reduction in ACT
from 25 to 20 per cent is apparently more or less written in stone. A
measure which was presented as a way of helping companies to overcome a
problem of surplus ACT can also be seen as a tax on pension funds and
certain other investors. This 'help' for the corporate sector is budgeted to
raise an extra Pounds 900m in 1995-96.
The 'imputation' system of UK corporation tax is 20 years old. It was
introduced to iron out distortions, so that profits would be similarly taxed
whether retained or distributed, and there would be little bias in favour of
debt rather than equity finance.
Within a closed economy with an evenly spread burden of income tax, this
approach would have made admirable sense. But nowadays more shares  -
perhaps 40 per cent in all - are owned by tax-exempt investors, in respect
of which the system actually creates a pro-dividend bias. Looking through
their shareholdings to the underlying company, pension funds bear a 33 per
cent tax on retained profits but only 10 2/3 per cent on dividends (soon
rising, however, to 16 1/4 per cent).
In addition, companies have become more international in scope, and listed
industrials could derive well over 40 per cent of their pre-tax earnings
from overseas subsidiaries in 1993. Meanwhile UK profits are depressed. So
ACT on dividends has expanded disproportionately to the domestic corporation
tax liability.
One approach, to segregate the distribution of overseas profits through
FIDs, is logical, although the details have yet to be clarified. It will not
be welcomed by pension funds and other gross investors, who will lose a 20
per cent tax credit; yet they can scarcely expect to reclaim overseas taxes.
But the proposal to reduce the rate of ACT on normal dividends, paid out of
UK profits, to a level below the basic rate of income tax, is more
questionable. Not only occupational pension funds but also individual
holders of personal pension plans and personal equity plans have had the
reasonable expectation that they would be sheltered from dividend taxes on
established contracts, whatever might happen in future. The element of
retrospection is worrying.
In addition, the bias in favour of debt finance is being increased. Interest
payments can be received gross by pension funds, but dividends will be
subject to tax of 16 1/4 per cent. This bias may suit a government which has
vast quantities of debt to sell. But is this a wise time to be raising the
cost of equity finance for companies?
Third, to 'help' companies by attacking their pension funds could prove
counter-productive. Many companies, perhaps as many as 40 per cent, are
still enjoying pension fund contribution holidays because of surpluses, but
now scheme valuations must be made on the basis of a reduced gross income
stream.
There is a case for arguing that companies are paying out too much in
dividends, and there is a rather weaker case for saying that the exempt
investor sector has become too large and should bear more of the tax burden.
But these matters should be tackled openly, and not by proposing undiscussed
changes to company taxation with motives that have not been fully spelt out.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Final search for the missing link: The case for the Channel
tunnel rail link is persuasive, but who will fund it?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once, Britain led the world when it came to building railways. Early
Victorian entrepreneurs criss-crossed the land with tracks while most of the
rest of civilisation languished in the age of the horse. By the middle of
the 19th century, nearly all the most important bits of Britain's modern-day
system had been built.
Today, the roles are reversed. Britain has been left behind in the new
railway race, at least by its Continental neighbours. France has opened
nearly 500 miles of high-speed lines in the past 10 years and is planning
for a network of 3,000 miles by 2005. Germany will have built some 1,500
miles of high-speed lines by the same date. Italy and Spain are building
more than 700 miles each. In Britain, no new main line railway has been
built since 1899.
Still, a small catching-up exercise appears to have been initiated with last
week's go-ahead for a rail link between London and the Channel tunnel.
Admittedly, the line is not expected to open until the turn of the century.
Its maximum speed is only 140 mph - slow compared with its Continental
rivals. And it will be only 68 miles long. But at least it is a start.
Or is it? In spite of the government's attempt to portray the line as a
certainty, few have been fooled. The project, it has been widely noted,
suffers from a potential flaw: there is not actually any money available to
fund it. Not, that is, unless the private sector is prepared to help
shoulder the burden.
In the old days, this would not have mattered a jot. Almost all that was
needed to build a railway line in the 19th century was the idea. With
construction costs low and other forms of transport offering little
competition, railways were a licence to print money. Investors' money
showered down on them like confetti.
Now, however, the economics of railways have changed. Construction costs
have soared, not least because of the growing need to design projects that
minimise noise and nuisance. More seriously still, railways have lost many
of their competitive advantages: road transport is cheaper over short
distances, and air transport faster over long ones. These days, there is
barely a railway project in the world that stands up as a commercial
proposition.
The Channel tunnel rail link is no exception. The 108-page report on the
project published last week is thin on financial detail, but there is enough
to show that six years of vacillation over the line have done little to
improve its viability. Even with costs whittled down from Pounds 3.5bn last
year to Pounds 2.5bn, forecast revenues are expected to produce a real rate
of return on the investment of only 4 per cent - far short of the rate of
return the private sector is likely to require.
This is a pity, because there are persuasive reasons for building the line
that go beyond purely commercial considerations. One is that capacity on
existing lines between London and the Channel tunnel is expected to run out
around the turn of the century, so raising the prospect of embarrassing
scenes as high-speed international expresses from Paris and Brussels queue
behind British Rail commuter trains for access to the capital. Another is
that the new line will bring benefits which cannot necessarily be captured
through revenues: for example, big improvements in journey times for people
using the commuter trains that will share it. If a value could be put on
these, the economic return on the scheme would increase to 11 or 12 per
cent.
If Britain were France, this would be reason enough for letting the public
sector take the project forward. But Britain cannot afford it: so instead it
is hoping that the private sector can be persuaded to build the line with a
contribution of public sector cash in recognition of the wider benefits it
would bring.
The trouble is, the government has tried this before, and it didn't work. In
spring 1990, a joint public and private sector called European Rail Link
devised a plan for a rail link producing roughly the same returns as the
current scheme. In that instance, the sums of public sector cash needed to
make the project viable were so large that the government angrily rejected
the proposal. With constraints on public spending even tougher now than they
were then, why should things be any different this time?
The main source of hope lies in the government's new-found determination to
see more joint funding of infrastructure projects. Treasury guidelines
issued a fortnight ago envisage the sort of scheme where the private sector
gets its returns through charges to users while the public sector gets its
returns in the form of wider social benefits.
In the past, the Treasury's objection to this kind of arrangement has been
the belief that it amounts to using taxpayers' money to subsidise private
sector profits. Now, however, it has undergone a conversion: it is prepared
to accept such a deal provided value for money is secured by selecting the
private sector partner through competition.
From there, it becomes possible to envisage a simple way forward for the
Channel tunnel link. At the end of the public consultation exercise on the
route this autumn, the government could hold an auction for the ownership of
Union Railways, the British Railway subsidiary in charge of the rail link
project. The winner would be the private sector entity wanting the smallest
dowry to acquire the company and take the project forward.
One weakness with this appealingly simple idea, however, is that the private
sector would require a very high rate of return at this stage of the project
because the next phase - legislation - would bring the risk of redesigns and
soaring costs. The level of grant demanded by the private sector would in
all likelihood be far beyond the public purse.
But things might look very different in September 1995. By then, with luck,
the necessary legislation will be in place. Significantly, too, the
international trains between Britain and the Continent - due to start
operating in June 1994 - should have been running on existing tracks for
more than a year, so there will be much more certainty over revenues. The
only big risk left then will be the construction risk, so the private sector
should settle for a much lower rate of return.
There is another wrinkle, too. With the international trains already in
operation, they will be producing a stream of income for British Rail. That
stream of income will automatically switch to the rail link's owners when
the new line opens at the turn of the century. But suppose the government
offers to hand that stream of income over to the private sector from day
one. Based on the government's expected rate of return on railway
investment, it would appear that British Rail hopes to recoup at least
Pounds 600m between now and the end of the century from the Pounds 1.4bn it
is investing in its international passenger business. That would be a
significant contribution towards the cost of building the new rail link.
And yet, as last week's project report shows, even if the whole of this
Pounds 600m income is made over to the rail link and BR's Pounds 1.4bn
capital investment is written off, the financial return on the rail link
still only rises from 4 per cent to 10 per cent. To get the return up to the
sort of levels the private sector would require - assumed in the document to
be 12 1/2 per cent at this stage - the government would still have to offer
a big grant. To give an idea of how big, the report shows that a grant
reflecting all Pounds 1.1bn of commuter benefits would push the return up to
15 per cent at best.
Will the Treasury really stomach a write-off of Pounds 1.4bn worth of
existing public sector investment and an outlay of up to Pounds 1.1bn in
public sector funds to get the Channel tunnel rail link built? If it does,
it will have to swallow hard. And at the very least, it is likely to insist
on a concessionary agreement that requires the line to be handed back to the
public sector at the end of an agreed period.
The private sector, meanwhile, may have reservations of its own. The last
time anyone set out to build a high-speed route to the Continent was when
Sir Edward Watkin, the Victorian entrepreneur, started work on a route from
Manchester to Paris in the 1880s. His Great Central Railway only ever got as
far as London, proved hopelessly uneconomic and never paid a dividend. Today
only grassy mounds remain where the tracks once lay.

However much the long shadow once cast by Mao Zedong has shortened since his
death, his mortal remains are as big as ever. Or so Chinese authorities have
ruled in response to persistent rumours that the ex-leader's embalmed body
is shrinking in its glass-topped coffin in a mausoleum off Tiananmen Square.
Any impression of shrinkage is merely an illusion caused by peculiar spatial
and lighting effects in the hall, says the mausoleum's director Xu Jing. And
she should know. She has been looking after Mao's corpse since arriving at
his deathbed four hours after he expired on September 9 1976.

Fancy an overseas acquisition? Take note of the following cautionary tale
from a seasoned non-executive director, who prefers to remain anonymous.
Having bought a company in a fast-growing market in some sunny place, don't
be surprised if the business soon develops teething troubles. First sign of
trouble is when head office has to send someone from 'production' to see
what's wrong in the newly acquired factory. The second sign all is not well
is when young Jones, and a couple of his hot-shot MBAs from marketing, have
to be seconded for a six-month stint to 'sort out sales' in the
underperforming subsidiary. When the business still doesn't pick up, the
internal auditors are sent for.
Final step is to call in the liquidators and sue the original vendor. Sound
familiar?

For all Jacques Attali's vocal support for the Russians' reform programme,
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's chairman gave signs
of thinking they had gone a bit far yesterday in demonstrating their need
for western aid.
His visit to the country's provinces was cut short by a truck which ripped
into his bullet-proof limousine. Although the crash was spectacular, the
50-year-old escaped with scratches to his face. But when his apologetic
hosts blamed the accident on primitive Russian highways, he replied:
'In Stalin's time, you would no doubt have been sent to the camps for an
accident involving a foreign guest. Today, all you are doing is asking an
international institution for money to improve your roads.'
Fortunately, by the time he dined with local officials and industrial
managers in the historic town of Suzdal, he'd relented enough to promise he
would return.

Morgan Grenfell chairman John Craven has survived as a member of Deutsche
Bank's board of managing directors since 1990 and Deutsche's Ellen
Schneider-Lenne has been on the board of ICI since 1991. Even so, a few
eyebrows may be raised at the sight of Louis Hughes, General Motors' big
wheel in Europe, going on Deutsche Bank's supervisory board.
Not only is he probably the first US business executive to be welcomed on to
the supervisory board of a German blue chip, but he is joining the board of
a company holding a big stake in one of his rivals, Daimler-Benz. But
Hughes, a German speaker who used to run GM's Opel operation, is more
attuned to German customs than most North Americans. So he probably won't
have much difficulty fitting in with the strange customs of Germany's
corporate establishment.
Indeed, the real surprise about the appointment is how Hughes can find the
time to do it, given that his own responsibilities now stretch well beyond
Europe.

There's no doubting the long arm of the Irish law. Having moved from Dublin
to Malaysia a while back, one of Observer's colleagues has been summoned to
appear in a court in Ireland.
The offence? Possessing 'certain apparatus for wireless telegraphy, to wit,
a colour television set such keeping or possession not having been
authorised by a licence for the time being in force'.
He denies the charge, claiming he vacated the site of the alleged crime
almost a year before it occurred. But he none the less feels sympathy for
the Irish authorities who try to bring such offenders to book - as witness
the inspector who on challenging another unlicensed Dublin citizen, was told
the house had no TV.
'What's that then?' said the inspector, pointing to a video machine in the
corner. 'Oh that contraption?' came the reply, 'I only bought it for the
clock.'

This time there was no Flag-lieutenant Pascoe to hoist 'England expects . .

boatloads of French fishermen did not find Britain entirely lacking the
Nelson touch.
It was supplied by Stephen Redfarn, former corporate finance supremo at
Henry Ansbacher, now turned chief executive of commercial television's new
baby, the three-month-old West Country TV.
Although its policy is to stake its reputation on hard news, that is a
commodity in scarce supply in Plymouth and the fishing villages from Anvil
Point to the Scillies. So with the French besetting the Channel Islands, and
briefly occupying Guernsey's St Peter Port harbour, Redfarn was not one to
turn a blind eye.
He upped and signalled his seven roving news crews, a camera-hand and a
reporter apiece, that if they laid alongside the enemy they would not do
wrong. And the pell-mell media battle raged.
As the smoke cleared, the British Audience Research Bureau's overnight TV
ratings brought Redfarn good news. Westward TV had out-fought the BBC for
the first time, the body-count awarding the newcomer 40 per cent of the
audience during the Guernsey invasion as against Auntie Beeb's 35 per cent.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Nigeria's mission feared impossible: Edward Balls and Tony
Hawkins on the tasks facing one of Africa's biggest economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sitting in his top floor office, Chief Ernest Shonekan, chairman of
Nigeria's transitional council, stresses his government's commitment to
economic reform and ends with a heartfelt plea: 'For God's sake, help us to
succeed because this is Nigeria's last chance.'
The office window offers a panoramic view of the country's new capital,
Abuja, a monument to Nigeria's malaise. A grandiose project, half-finished
as petro-dollars ran out, and boasting two luxury hotels in which civil
servants and politicians live at the state's expense, its construction has
been notorious for inflated contracts and kick-backs.
Chief Shonekan, who chairs the council installed by President Ibrahim
Babangida to govern the country until the delayed transition from military
to civilian rule is completed in August, is promising to provide what the
soldiers have conspicuously failed to deliver: sound economic management. In
recent weeks, he and senior officals have travelled to London, Washington
and Paris pleading for western aid and debt relief in return.
Yet the transitional council poses an awkward dilemma for Nigeria's western
creditors. Few observers doubt that Africa's most populous nation, burdened
by chronic official debts amounting to 113 per cent of gross domestic
product last year, has no chance of economic regeneration without debt
reduction. A recent International Monetary Fund report concluded that,
without debt relief, Nigeria would face an average Dollars 2bn a year gap in
its balance of payments throughout this decade.
The dismal record of the military government, combined with discouraging
statements from the civilian presidential candidates, means that western
creditors are extremely wary of pouring good money after bad. They are
demanding an agreement with the IMF and a lengthy record of sound financial
management before they will consider offering debt relief - conditions that
the transitional council cannot meet within its short period in office.
To Chief Shonekan, chairman for many years of the Unilever trading
subsidiary, UAC Nigeria, the west's lack of interest seems dangerous.
Nigeria's leaders find it difficult to understand why the west is reacting
coolly to his administration's commitments to restoring fiscal discipline,
abolishing the distorting domestic fuel subsidy which could bring in an
estimated N63bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in extra revenue and wipe out this year's
projected N28.6bn budget deficit.
Yet while the council intends to make progress in reforming Nigeria's
distorted and deteriorating economy - income per head has fallen from
Dollars 1,000 a year in 1980 to a mere Dollars 290 in 1991 - the odds appear
firmly stacked against it.
First, the council is currently hampered by the consequences of rash
decisions made before it assumed control three months ago. The escalating
cost of the protracted election process, combined with the problems of heavy
military spending and profligate public procurement practices, meant that
the budget deficit grew to 9.8 per cent of GDP last year, of which more than
half was the result of unaccounted off-budget spending. The deficit has been
financed largely by borrowing from the central bank, fuelling rapid monetary
growth and resulting in a sharply higher annual inflation rate of 54 per
cent by the end of the year, up from 13 per cent in 1991.
The result is that the indicators of financial performance look bleak, in
spite of the council's attempts to bring the budget under control. Inflation
has since crept up to more than 60 per cent annually and is expected to
accelerate - possibly even double - this year as the effects of last year's
excess spending feed through.
The council is also being blamed for the military government's inability to
meet its debt obligations. In Paris last week Chief Dele Olashore, the
finance secretary, was on the receiving end of a sharp rebuke from the Paris
Club of official creditors angry at the renewed build-up of an estimated
Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn in arrears and delayed payments to both the public
and private sectors.
Second, and more worrying, is the fact that the transitional council has so
far been unable to bring its financial management under control,
particularly the increasingly chaotic exchange rate system.
A year ago the central bank sanctioned an 80 per cent devaluation of the
official naira exchange rate to close the distorting gap between the
official fixed rate and the 'parallel' market rate, considered by the IMF to
be an important indicator of financial mismanagement. But the budget deficit
and accelerating inflation have caused this gap to reopen in recent months,
despite the loss of much of the country's foreign exchange reserves, as
investors try to flee the currency.
But rather than allow the official rate to fall to the parallel rate the
council tried to buck the market. It cancelled foreign exchange auctions and
then rationed US dollars at the over-valued official rate, a policy which
enriches the banking sector while starving importers of necessary foreign
exchange.
To World Bank observers, the lack of a clear and sensible exchange rate
policy suggests that the military, not the council, is in control of
economic policy. The exchange rate confusion casts doubt on the council's
ability to push through politically unpopular tax increases and spending
cuts which will be needed if the council is to reach an agreement with the
IMF.
The third problem for the council is the proximity of the hand-over to
civilian rule, assuming that Nigeria's military president does not shift the
goalposts once more. Unless the council acts decisively, it is likely to be
written off as a lame-duck administration with which the west dare not do
business.
But there is a real danger that the combination of rising debt and
deep-seated public antipathy towards western-inspired structural adjustment
programmes will persuade the politicians to risk going it alone, thereby
cutting off the option of debt relief. Both presidential candidates oppose
the increase in petrol prices, now a precondition for an IMF agreement, and
neither has given a clear commitment to the reform policies.
Apparently boxed in from all sides, the transitional council leaders
privately wonder whether they were correct to ignore friendly advice and
take on the job in the first place. But, brief though its tenure may be, the
council may still have time to put a number of irreversible reforms in
place, thereby setting the parameters for the incoming civilian government.
The council has already appointed a budget monitoring committee of prominent
businessmen to ensure some accountability and transparency in public
finances; it has started the phased removal of the domestic petroleum
subsidy; and it is planning to broaden the tax base by the launch of a
modified value-added tax.
In return, the council would commit itself to a 'shadow' reform programme
with the IMF, which the incoming administration could use to pave the way
for an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) - a source of
concessional finance.
A pledge on debt relief is essential to this strategy. The stick that the
IMF can shake at the new civilian president is the suspension of the shadow
programme if he resorts to extra-budgetary spending to reward his campaign
supporters. Debt reduction is the carrot which, if staged over the life of
the ESAF, would ease pressure on the balance of payments and release funds
for social spending. But that carrot is unlikely to appear before Chief
Shonekan hands over in August, however, and his plea for help seems unlikely
to go unanswered.
'If the western creditors withhold support and want us to commit suicide
then they will lose, as well as us,' warns Chief Olashore, formerly a
leading Nigerian banker, hinting at the turmoil elsewhere in Africa as
examples of what might happen in Nigeria. 'I hope that they are informed
enough to prevent that from happening.'

Sir, With regard to the announcement of the Channel Tunnel rail link, nobody
to my knowledge has yet advanced a commercial rationale for joining two
loss-making and, in some ways, incompatible rail systems with a very
expensive tunnel.
UK taxpayers should ponder the equity of a Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn subsidy
(for 'investment' without return that is) on a form of transport which will
partly be funded by tax paid by private-sector coach, bus, freight, taxi,
airline and ferry operators. These providers will, in turn, face enhanced
competition from a rail service which alone among transport forms cannot
operate without state subsidy.

Sir, I am concerned to read the piece 'Waterloo terminal may be obsolete in
six years' (March 29).
You correctly quote our report in saying the journey to Waterloo would be
longer by about 17 minutes than journeys from St Pancras/King's Cross.
However, you are wrong to suggest that the savings over the old journey
times will be negligible.
As our report indicated, and I have repeated, there will still be a time
benefit of about 15 minutes for Waterloo trains from use of the Union
Railway compared with the best times which will be available next year.
I am concerned that as a result you may have presented an unduly
unfavourable view of the prospects for Waterloo International Terminal which
can only be demotivating for those setting out to make it into an
outstanding success in the next few years.

Sir, Re your article 'Barclays sets a trap for fraudsters' (March 27/28),
the Royal Bank of Scotland is currently reporting zero fraud rates after
testing the use of photographs on cheque cards for 18 months.
Barclays states that its preferred method of fraud prevention is
technological developments at the point of sale, to enable higher
proportions of transactions to be authorised. The problem for retailers is
that they have to bear the cost of on-line units - up to Pounds 300 a year
each. The photo-card solution is effective and could be implemented faster
than authorisation of 50 per cent of transactions by 1996.

Sir, The animal-based emotive advertisements used by the Co-operative Bank
('Profits and the white-collar conscience', March 25) show it to be a highly
selective institution. For instance, the term 'blood sports' has a clear
meaning to most people (vide OED) but it is not that of the Co-op. For the
Co-op fox hunting is bad, but shooting for 'sport' is not; its response to
my enquiry was: 'We do not have a definitive policy on shooting'. But if you
only read its literature you would not know this. After all if those
advertisements showed a jolly hunter with gun, dead deer and pheasant with
the text saying 'I did it all with my Co-op Bank loan', it would not attract
the depositors in the same way. But it would be just as true a portrayal of
its ethical stance based on its moral judgments.
What can be seen as particularly hypocritical is that CWS Agriculture (part
of the bank's parent) not only runs pheasant shoots with gun dogs on its own
land, but actually rears the pheasants for the annual sporting kill] It is
difficult not to be cynical when one also finds out that the ethical stance
was created from 'the views of our own customers'.
It is good that people want to know the value-added contribution to society
that a company makes. Is the Co-op Bank really trying to do that, or is it
just trying to generate deposits?

FT  31 MAR 93 / Time bomb ticks: France's new government must bite the
bullet on farm subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last November, just after the US presidential election, I found myself
talking to a senior figure in Jacques Chirac's Gaullist party - a man likely
to be a member of France's new government. We were at one of those
transatlantic gatherings where Europeans get their ears bashed by Americans
for being parochial, protectionist and so forth.
The tune of the moment was that Europe had better pull its finger out and
clinch a Gatt deal while nice Mr George Bush was still in the White House,
because once nasty Mr Bill Clinton got there all bets would be off. The
logic of this advice seemed so impeccable that people were even predicting
it would be taken. During a coffee-break I wandered over to my Gaullist
friend and asked if he thought this at all plausible. To my surprise he said
yes, a deal before January 20 was quite on the cards.
'What,' I said, 'you think the French Socialist government will bite the
bullet before the elections?'
'Look,' he replied. 'Obviously this thing is a time-bomb that they're trying
to leave for us when we take over in March. But they're not going to get
away with it. It's ticking too loudly.'
Well, he was both right and wrong. A week or two later the European
Community and the Bush administration did reach an agreement on agricultural
subsidies, the most divisive issue in the Uruguay Round negotiations. The
French government denounced this as unacceptable, provoking shrieks of scorn
from the opposition. The latter predicted scathingly, and no doubt hoped
secretly, that the government would end up capitulating en rase campagne (in
open country), handing over France's farmers gagged and bound to the dreaded
Anglo-Saxon adversary.
But somehow the time-bomb failed to explode. Mr Helmut Kohl and Mr John
Major, both needing French co-operation on other issues, agreed not to make
the Gatt an issue at the EC Edinburgh summit last December. At the Gatt
itself other matters prevented a comprehensive agreement being reached
before January 20. Mr Clinton duly arrived in office and appointed Mr Mickey
Kantor his trade negotiator. As Mr Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan called each
other names across the Atlantic, the pressure on France relaxed. Now my
friend and his colleagues are moving into ministerial offices in Paris, only
to find the time-bomb still ticking.
Their position recalls that of Harold Wilson in 1974, when he returned to
power, pledged to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EC. He had to go
through the motions of doing so, with the grudging co-operation of Britain's
European partners, even though all concerned knew he was not going to get
any significant improvement on the terms negotiated by his predecessor.
It is hard to see how the EC can avoid going through some such exercise now
with France. To expect the new government to sign the deal with the US as it
stands, after denouncing it so stridently in the election campaign, is
hardly realistic. But it is equally unlikely that the Clinton administration
will accept significant concessions beyond those agreed by its predecessor.
A cosmetic 'renegotiation' seems the only way out, but it will require great
diplomatic ingenuity.
Some politicians in both Paris and Washington will hope the deal collapses,
each reckoning the blame can be pinned on the other side. Yet that cannot be
in either French or American interests, let alone those of the rest of the
world. The boost to world trade from a successful conclusion of the round is
almost the only hope left of generating the extra resources needed to honour
commitments made at the Rio earth summit last year, and to help Russia and
other ex-communist states make the transition to capitalism without causing
global disaster.
More parochially, but still very important, it offers the only hope of
pulling western Europe out of its present miasma of unemployment and
pessimism. The interest of western Europe in that happening is obvious
enough. But it is crucial to the future of central and eastern Europe too.
Last week at the annual Anglo-German gathering in Konigswinter I listened to
pleas from those concerned with the welfare of central and eastern Europe,
urging the absolute necessity of west European markets being opened to
products that east Europeans can produce competitively, notably steel. The
German steelworkers marching through Bonn, on the other side of the Rhine,
were just out of earshot. Their interests, and those of their UK
counterparts, were represented by politicians well aware that imports from
the east are only a marginal factor in the unavoidable contraction of the
west European steel industry. Yet none of them volunteered to go and put the
case of Czech, Slovak or Polish steelworkers to British and German
constituents faced with rising unemployment.
That will not change until there are real prospects for those made redundant
to find other jobs in new, more competitive industries. And that in turn
will not happen until there is an upturn in the west European economy, for
which a renewed expansion of world trade offers the best hope.
As France's new rulers nerve themselves for the inevitable accusations of
betrayal from angry farmers, let us hope they can keep that broader economic
picture in mind.
In last week's column I wrote, incorrectly, that many of the present Russian
parliamentarians 'were chosen under the old Soviet system, which gave seats
to organisations . . . as well as to territorial constituencies'. In fact
the 1990 election was held only in territorial constituencies, although
under communist rule and without other organised parties.

Sir, The oft-repeated assertion that public transport in Paris is all
sweetness and light ('Too many bodies spoil the broth', March 29) needs to
be questioned. While working there on and off for the past six months, I
have had to endure repeated strikes on the Metro and RER, suffer attack by
ever-widening sprawls of graffiti and feel a general sense of malaise.
Urban railways look wonderful when new but quickly need millions in
maintenance. Paris now faces such costs on lines built in the 1970s and
1980s and pay huge operating subsidies as well. Prospects are bleak. London
has its problems but many stations now look neat and management is making
impressive efforts to cover running costs from revenue.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Letter: Diverting unemployment from coal industry to oil and
gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES S COBBETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For someone who works in oil and gas exploration and production, the
difference in treatment given to this industry (a long-term cash cow for the
national exchequer) and the coal industry (a long-term drain on the national
exchequer) is of continuing concern. Currently, for example, public opinion
appears to favour spending taxpayers' money to divert unemployment from the
coal industry into the oil and gas industry.
This is well illustrated in your story 'Heseltine fails to calm Tory fears
on pits' (March 29), where further hand-outs to the coal industry are said
to provide 'dramatic opportunities', whereas lower taxes paid by the North
Sea oil industry ('Spoils of the North Sea', March 29) are described as
'subsidising sub-optimal investment'.
The oil industry would like to know how its 'sub-optimal investments' may be
converted into 'dramatic opportunities'.

Sir, It is a cause for regret that integrity is not among the main qualities
required of IBM's new chief executive (Management, March 29).
As a former employee I always viewed integrity as the cornerstone of IBM's
business philosophy. I do hope that a change in the company's approach to
business ethics is not being signalled via the published 'wish-list'.
Our work with companies indicates that integrity is an increasingly
highly-prized quality, both by customers and staff in today's tough business
environment. The public mood, too, is changing with a growing emphasis on
high standards of business conduct.
It would be refreshing if the new incumbent took an early opportunity to
underscore IBM's commitment to corporate ethics, for the sake of the entire
business community.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Arts: Le Roi malgre lui - Opera de Nantes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chabrier's comic opera Le Roi malgre lui has won an almost mythical
reputation among musicians in spite of a daunting degree of inaccessibility.
Revivals have been scarce, the vocal score has long been out of print. The
first and only complete recording was released in 1985. Further reasons for
inaccessibility are the burning down of the Paris Opera-Comique a few days
after the premiere in 1887, and the notorious weakness of the libretto.
Opera failures are frequently blamed on the book - rightly so in this case.
This cultivated, eminently literate composer was impetuous when it came to
choosing opera texts. For Le Roi malgre lui he chose an old Palais Royal
vaudeville which he asked two librettists, de Najac and Burani, to turn into
a comic opera. The result was so poor and so confused that he called in the
poet Richepin. When Richepin gave up Chabrier himself finished the job as
best as he could. He had no illusions about the outcome.
There remains an ambiguity of style and tone: inside this score stuffed to
bursting with marvellous music (grand opera parodies, echoes of Berlioz,
Gounod and Bizet, all filtered through his own strong personality) there is
surely a romantic opera struggling to get out. Chabrier himself described it
as 'an operetta in fancy underwear'. One wonders how Opera North will attack
the identity problem with the English version it is preparing for next
season. Meanwhile Nantes, as usual enterprising and discriminating in
choosing from the native repertory, has mounted its own production for four
performances.
But first, back to the libretto. The king in question is Henri de Valois,
third son to the ambitious, scheming French Queen Mother, Catherine de
Medici. Henri, longing to rebel against his formidable mama but lacking the
courage to do so, does not want to stay in Poland and not all the Poles want
to have him. Light-heartedly he passes himself off as his closest friend,
the Comte de Nangis, who in his turn is made to play the king. Among Henri's
suite is a Venetian intriguer, Fritelli, married to a Polish lady, Alexina,
with whom Henry had lately had an affair in Venice - neither being aware of
the other's identity.
Alexina is niece to Laski, the chief plotter against Henri. One of Laski's
serfs, Minka, in love with Nangis, passes information about the conspiracy.
It becomes increasingly difficult to remember at any given moment who knows
the real identities of Henri and Nangis - and except for the girl Minka none
of the characters is, so far as the drama is concerned, interesting or even
particularly sympathetic. Musically they are sharply drawn. Finally Henri,
poised to escape over the Polish border, learns that the alternative
candidate for the throne has withdrawn and promptly decides to stay -
presumably to be near Alexina, whose husband Fritelli is conveniently sent
on a mission to France. The real-life Henri succeeded his brother as Henri
III and scuttled back to home, mummy and the mignons.
One may sympathise with a producer trying to bridge the chasm between this
tedious imbroglio and a score overflowing with robust tunes, vital rhythm,
succulent harmony and kingfisher orchestration. At Nantes Oliver Desbordes
(producer), Patrice Gouron (sets and lighting) and Jean-Pierre Capeyron
(costumes) plastered over the crack a sugary coating of pantomime cuteness.
A sadly misconceived first act, a snow-scene like a Disneyfied Nutcracker,
contained two unforgivable sins - curtain up during the splendid prelude to
show clowning in the snow and (believe it or not) comic skating during the
entirely serious, meditative introduction to Henri's beautiful lament for
France. The second act was better; the third act was mixed. At least, no
concept or social comment.
Much of the best solo music falls to Minka. Natalie Dessay was bright,
strong and agile, sometimes a little hard. Elizabeth Procuronoff's Alexina
was an effective foil (the two women's ravishing Nocturne in the last act
was a major pleasure). Henri was Franck Leguerinel, a pleasant light
baritone who phrases musically but, condemned by the producer to a childish
skittishness, was unable to hold the centre of the stage. The accomplished
tenor Leonard Pezzino had the style for Nangis but not enough bite. The
potentially unfunny buffo role of Fritelli was saved by Marc Barrard's
expert delivery of his two solos. Serge Bernard played the conspiring Laski
as a Dracula-figure.
The conductor, Valentin Reymond, controlled the tricky ensembles with aplomb
and blended the lustrous colours in the orchestra adeptly. One or two speeds
I thought marginally too staid. It is accepted wisdom to praise this score
for not being 'too Wagnerian'. I am not so sure. Behind those scrumptious
chords of the ninth and that constant flow of invention, cannot one hear the
sanity, humanity and exuberance of Die Meistersinger? Anyway, this revival
proves that in spite of the book, Le Roi malgre lui can work in the theatre.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Arts: Big Night Out . . . - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You never know what kind of show Sandi Toksvig's Big Night Out at the Little
Sands Picture Palace is going to be. By turns, it is backstage farce, a
sentimental tale of small lives in a small town, a Dennis Potter-type
exercise in lacing realistic narrative with fantasies of period music, and a
crazy hide-the-corpse black comedy.
Does that sound a bit much? Well, so it proves. Toksvig and her director,
Pip Broughton, cannot quite bring off all her changes of tack. The play, at
the Nottingham Playhouse, never gels. But right up to the end it keeps on
surprising you with its sudden shifts of tone. Things seem to arrive at one
rousing musical conclusion, only to move onto a quiet epilogue with a
startling last piece of plot. Neither finale nor epilogue is quite pulled
off in context of the whole show, and yet the mixture of absurdity and
pathos leaves a touching impression. Likewise the blend of theatricality and
intimate tenderness.
Big Night Out is set in an old seaside cinema, formerly a theatre, now on
its last legs. The main three characters are its usherettes - Molly (played
by Toksvig herself), Barbara (Anita Dobson), and Grace (Una Stubbs). Molly
is eccentric, inefficient, but crazily devoted to the old theatre. Barbara
is part man-crazy bimbo, part soft-voiced martyr and do-gooder ('You try my
patience - and I thank you for it'). Grace, by contrast, is a sane, cynical,
chain-smoking and wise-cracking old bird whom life has passed by. Though the
play does not succeed in making us believe in all their inconsistencies, its
attempt to make them three dimensional, complex beings is its finest
feature.
The two features that are most arresting are its farcical craziness and its
sudden switches into musical-theatre numbers. Part of the farce business is
standard - the man caught with his shirt off, the panic to hide the
evidence, and so on. But the farce is also taken to dizzy, if contrived,
heights because the play is set in an old theatre, with old chunks of
scenery hanging around and masses of ropes (each hoisting who knows what).
The corpse, for example, is swung on ropes, trolleys, and down a trapdoor.
As for the musical-theatre stuff, this is the old theatre's very ghost.
Molly is always in touch with it; it suddenly consumes Barbara; and it
finally envelops Grace too. The theatre's ghosts are a fine team, led by the
solo singer Beverley Klein, whose way of putting over a big song without
microphone is a pleasure rare in the theatre today. (Hers could be a major
talent. I wish only that she were a little less invulnerable and camp.)
As for Toksvig, Dobson and Stubbs, they deliver performances worthy of their
roles - which means that Dobson, in particular, discovers new possibilities.
Were this plot played without laughs, hers would be its most daring feat of
psychopathology. She shows you that, and yet makes the character absurdly
funny too. She is all soft-voiced sweetness covering a wild fury, an easy
lay who later reveals that she has never truly enjoyed sex. The way she hugs
the corpse in her arms as if he had never died is daft, but so poignant that
it wipes the laugh from your face.
Nottingham Playhouse until May 1

It is right that television should be doing whatever it can to ease the
problems of the homeless, though experience over some decades should have
taught us by now that, with homelessness as with violence, television has
precious little effect. As part of its 'Gimme Shelter' season, Channel 4
repeats the famous 1966 BBC drama Cathy Come Home (10.35). In its time this
was thought to be tremendously influential; it was regarded as a truism that
it led directly to the formation of the charity Shelter, even though Des
Wilson, who ran Shelter, denies it. And today there are more homeless in
Britain than when the drama was first shown. Better, however, to see it and
have your heartstrings tugged than not to see it. In Bookmark Simon Armitage
goes in search of fellow poet Weldon Kees who, in 1955, abandoned his car on
the Golden Gate Bridge and disappeared (8.10 BBC2). The same channel screens
the second episode of Goggle Eyes (9.25) the story of a new man in the life
of a one-parent family, with splendid performances from Honeysuckle Weeks
and Victoria Shalet as sisters.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Arts: When it's the real thing - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the earliest columns I wrote for this page said that while television
fiction was fun, fact was the real thing; when done well, documentary and
current affairs programmes represented the pinnacle of television's
achievements. However, today that distinction seems less obvious, if indeed
there is a distinction at all. As time and a multitude of programmes go by,
what seems to matter more and more is the intent and integrity of the
programme maker and not the form that the programme happens to take.
But surely there is such a fundamental difference between, say, the Nine
O'Clock News and Lipstick On Your Collar that the very idea of comparison
becomes ludicrous: the news programme is a factual report, constructed by a
large team of journalists aiming for objectivity, whereas the drama is an
entertainment springing from the mind of one person with no pretence at
being anything but subjective. Yet even at this extreme you could argue that
matters are not as simple as they seem. What they choose to show us on the
news must be less than one per cent of what comes in from staff, agencies
and wire services: deciding which 99 per cent to reject and which one per
cent to select is a highly subjective process.
It is true that news desks, at least in the western industrial democracies,
tend to share assumptions about the ranking in importance of the various
events going on in the world. But they are only assumptions; there is no
god-given list of ultimate news values, and if you replaced the existing
staff on the Nine O'Clock News, News At 10 and Channel 4 News with teams
from the Women's Institute, the National Front and the British Humanist
Association you might (after an initial period during which the newcomers
instinctively aped the professionals) achieve some very different news
programmes. The objective nature of news is much less dependable than most
of us tend to assume.
Dennis Potter's drama, on the other hand, may be much less of a flight of
fancy than it seems at first. In the best book about Potter yet published
(Potter On Potter, a series of interviews carried out by Graham Fuller:
Faber and Faber, Pounds 12.99, out last week) Potter again rejects the idea
that his television work - in particular The Singing Detective - is
autobiographical. 'The form of autobiography is very powerful because it
appears to be authentic. As I've said before, autobiography is one of the
most venal and lying of all the sub-art forms in prose' he declares. But
whether Potter's work is strictly 'autobiographical' or not, it is clear
that much of the strength of Lipstick On Your Collar comes from its
authenticity.
The songs are the main, but certainly not the only, means of achieving
period verisimilitude. From vintage cars to 1950s' clothes, from wooden
filing cabinets to the original brown-and-cream Nescafe tin, enormous care
has been taken to ensure that things are 'real' and these do not come out of
Potter's head in the way that CS Lewis's Narnia came out of his. Even such
detailed matters as the officer's habitual reference to the coffee break as
'time for a spot of the barely-bloody-drinkable' has about it the ring of
authenticity. It would be astonishing to discover that Potter had invented
that rather than remembered it from his own days as a Russian language clerk
in the Army. In other words it seems likely that this is closer to fact than
fiction.
But so what? Surely nobody would want to deny that Potter thought up the
story about oh-so-Welsh Francis Francis, flirtatious fantasising Sylvia, and
randy Harold Atterbow the bitter cinema organist? Naturally not, but in the
end (right the way through, actually) none of these characters mattered very
much. Their stories could have been usefully condensed into a 90-minute
single drama. What seems to have concerned Potter much more was to convey to
us the zeitgeist, and his feelings about it: his sadness at the increasing
influence of American culture in Britain; the end of empire and the
emasculation of the British lion as exemplified by the Suez fiasco; and the
continuing rigidity of the British class system despite the other changes.
Of course one individual's interpretation of the spirit of the times may be
at odds with ours, but this applies as much to supposedly factual as to
fictional programmes. Consider The Beginner's Guide To The State We're In, a
75-minute BBC2 programme in which young novelist and university teacher
Robert Wilson drove around the UK talking to 'the poor'. It is never wrong
for television to show the comfortable majority what life is like for those
who are worse off, but such matters are relative. The people we met via the
camera seemed not only well dressed and well enough fed to be chubby, they
could also afford such items as cigarettes and television.
Ranked against a global scale of wellbeing and poverty these people must fit
somewhere in the top 25 per cent, yet Wilson referred to them dolefully as
'the dispossessed'. He and producer Mike MacCormack laid mournful mood music
on the soundtrack, and Wilson's commentary and questions made it clear that
he felt they were deeply wronged. No doubt Wilson describes a glass as half
empty, and some other university lecturer who considered it half full could
make an equally persuasive programme arguing that the poor in Britain today
are better off than at any time in history. If not as selective and
subjective a piece of work as Lipstick On Your Collar, Wilson's programme
ran Potter's pretty close.
On the other side of that coin was the first episode of BBC2's Goggle Eyes,
a dramatisation by Deborah Moggach from a novel by Anne Fine. You can hardly
get more fictional than that, and yet, for those of us who are not female
and have never been part of a one-parent family, that opening episode (Part
2 is tonight) could serve almost as a text book . . . at least, I suspect it
could. It must be possible, in theory, that this picture of the strains
caused by the arrival of a new 'boyfriend' in the life of the mother is
sheer invention. But it vibrated with the sort of authenticity ('He's been
here before, he knows where the drinks are kept]' hissed a furious daughter)
which experience tells us is hard to fake.
By a similar sort of reckoning, it must theoretically be possible that the
elderly people in The Nineties, which has just begun on BBC2 on Sundays, and
A Labour Of Love, which comes to an end on BBC2 tomorrow night, are either
mis-remembering events or deliberately lying about them. But tests of
various sorts suggest otherwise. In The Nineties there is internal evidence.
It would take not a sceptic but a an out and out cynic to doubt the mutually
corroborative reminiscences of the amazing Summerhayes, mostly born in the
19th century, who served in the British Empire as missionaries and medics.
In A Labour Of Love you have not only similar internal evidence as elderly
people tell of the difficulties, techniques and joys of childcare between
1900 and 1950, you also have the track record of producer Steve Humphries
who made the excellent archive-and-interview series A Secret World Of Sex.
In the end, if we expect to get more than mindless entertainment from our
televisions we will have to learn to evaluate work from various producers
and networks in much the same way as generations of readers have learned to
evaluate books from various authors and publishers. Sometimes the supposedly
'factual' programmes will turn out to be largely fantasy, and sometimes the
fiction will bear out the saying that art is a lie which tells us the truth.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Arts: Bejart's 'Opera' - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maurice Bejart is the least timorous of choreographers. No theme, no
personality, is too considerable or too daunting to frighten him off, and no
score, it seems, can give him pause. From Wagner to Diaghilev, from the
French Revolution to the Hindu pantheon, from Beethoven 9 to Boulez' Marteau
sans maitre, Bejart will take on any comer, two falls or one submission
deciding the contest - and 'Bejart wins' ever the outcome. (The score or the
subject always loses is the moral of the event).
Now, in his second programme in the current Wells' season, Bejart takes on
not just an artist or a great score, but a nation. Opera, if I am to believe
what I saw on Monday night - and I wish I did not have to - is a
kaleidoscope of cliches about Verdi's music, Italian life, Francis of
Assisi, the Church of Rome, Pier Paolo Pasolini, plus a dear old 'Mama' who
sits at the side of the stage and knits, prays (as well she might,
considering the situation in which she finds herself) and a good deal of
chatter. At one moment the cast call out 'Gloria', and a chap who is, I
suspect, impersonating Christ, looks rather affronted at the nickname. Gems
from Verdi are played, in stormy Callas performances, and Stanislas de
Nussac wanders about the stage playing the saxophone. We hear part of a
speech by Hitler. A girl, having danced indifferently, demands the head of
John the Baptist, and is rewarded with this delicacy. (It looked as if she
had been given the head of the choreographer). Opera is compounded of such
inconsequentialities. Bejart's style of composition suggests nothing so much
as a grass-hopper mind leaping from one free association to another, playing
merry little intellectual jokes, being 'clever' at the expense of logic,
structure, and most seriously, of choreographic value. The text of Opera
ranges from the flimsy to the invisible, with posturing, Bejartian cliche
and vulgarity as a kind of danced fritto misto. It says nothing about
Italian opera, but a great deal about sensationalism as a substitute for
art. The company performances are suitably bombastic and tiresome.
The second part of the programme brought us Bejart's version of The
Miraculous Mandarin. It is a cussed score which encourages vulgarity - Gyula
Harangozo's staging for the Hungarian Ballet the only successful one of the
six I have seen. Bejart sticks to the narrative, though he cannot resist
dragging in Fritz Lang, and treats us to a brief appearance by Lang's
Siegfried in fur kilt and puttees as a client-victim for the whore.
The interest of the staging revolves round two interpretations: Koen Onzia
as the whore, and Juichi Kobayashi as the Mandarin. Both are very fine.
Showing the whore as a transvestite is an astute theatrical trick, and
serves to re-invent the tedious imagery of tarts on stage. Mr Onzia, white
faced, in a brief glittering frock, is at no moment a drag queen. His
reading is virile, ambiguous, vicious yet curiously innocent - as if the boy
were playing at being a woman to bring a greater zest to crime - and given a
sharp nervous edge of erotic provocation. Mr Kobayashi, a Maoist figure in
blue denim suit and cap replete with red star, wonderfully conveys the
invincible strength of the Mandarin. His dancing is clear - there is a bold,
sure technique here - and tireless physical resource as well as commanding
presence. The ending of the piece is par for the Bejartian course: the whore
dons a blond wig, then drops it at the Mandarin's feet. He gratifies his
lust with it, and the piece suddenly becomes L'Apres-midi d'un Phoney. But
Mr Onzia and Mr Kobayashi also make it fascinating and powerful.
The Rudra Bejart Lausanne season continues at Sadler's Wells until April 3

FT  31 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: The green time bomb - The EC
has established a benchmark for environmental management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited publication of the European Commission's ecological audit
proposals last week has finally ignited the fuse on an environmental time
bomb lurking under many companies across the EC.
After three years of discussion and amendments, companies now have the basis
for establishing a standardised, internationally recognised system of
environmental management and verification. Initial indications are that many
will take advantage of the scheme.
To be registered, companies will be required to adopt an environmental
policy which commits them to both complying with legislation and to
introducing continual improvements in performance. They must conduct an
initial environmental review of each participating site, develop a programme
and management system, and conduct audits at least every three years. They
must publish a public statement after the initial environmental review and
following each audit, which must, in turn, be approved by independent,
accredited environmental verifiers.
In exchange, companies may register the sites that have been scrutinised,
and use a logo to promote their involvement. But the symbol must not be used
on any products or packaging the company produces.
Since initial drafts of the regulation were first circulated in 1990, the
shape of the proposals has changed fundamentally. Most important, the scheme
has been converted from a mandatory proposal into a voluntary one, aimed
particularly at companies with industrial activities.
Equally, the proposals have been reduced in scope. To be approved, companies
will no longer require all operations on all sites to be examined. The
scheme has been modified so that businesses can choose which sites will be
covered by the audit.
Even since the previous draft was circulated last autumn, at least one
important change has taken place. The title and content of the regulation
has shifted from simply eco-audit to the eco-management and audit scheme
(Emas). It now makes considerable reference to environmental management
systems as well as their verification. Most of these changes have been
heralded as victories by British lobbyists. The introduction of
environmental management issues - and their detailed contents - echo closely
BS 7750, the new British standard on environmental management.
Mike Gilbert from the British Standards Institute says: 'It's about
establishing a benchmark for environmental management. The EC viewpoint is
that market forces are much more powerful tools than legislation. By making
it a competitive requirement, it will be a lot more attractive.'
Despite the concessions, Martin Houldin, head of the national environment
unit at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, stresses that many of the Emas
requirements remain rigorous.
A company must say it has identified all significant environmental issues;
that it has management systems which can identify those issues; and that the
information they produce can be relied on.
David Miller of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand says: 'Quite a few of our
clients are making preparations for it. They have draft environmental
reports but are waiting for comparative figures before publishing. There
will be incremental pressure to adopt the proposals over the next five
years.'
Some industrialists are concerned the regulations may ultimately be made
mandatory. But in the short term, business is more likely to face pressures
to comply from other companies and government bodies which demand compliance
as a condition for tenders. Companies such as British Telecom and B&amp;Q are
already moving in that direction by asking suppliers for details of their
environmental policies.
In the meantime, environmental reporting remains in its infancy. Body Shop
is one of the few companies to produce an independently-verified statement,
and is campaigning to see Emas become compulsory. National Power will do the
same this summer for the first time.
Michael Renger, a partner in the environment unit at lawyers Nabarro
Nathanson and author of a recent book on environmental auditing, says: 'This
is one of the clearest examples of recent European directives.'
But despite a set of regulations with 20 articles on 20 pages, and the same
again in annexes, the circulation of Emas last week is only the start of a
long process. Publication in the Official Journal in June will begin a
21-month timetable for implementation. A committee is being created to
monitor progress. After five years, the Commission is also reserving the
right to introduce amendments. Meanwhile several companies are involved in a
pilot programme to see how effectively the regulations will work in
practice.
Most important, a battle over the environmental verifiers is about to begin.
In a concession to subsidiarity, each EC member state will be expected to
develop a 'competent body' to promote Emas and maintain a register of sites;
and another body to accredit environmental verifiers.
In the UK, current thinking is that a new body may be created for the first
function, and the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies
take on the latter, expanding its existing role in approving verifiers for
BS 5750, the quality management standard. The Association of Environmental
Consultancies, a trade body for consultants, is also vying for this mantle.
Once accreditation has been determined, there will still be a debate over
who will be authorised as environmental verifiers. The latest edition of the
directory published by Environmental Data Services in London shows 339 firms
which it recognises in the UK. Some estimates suggest there are more than
1,000 business claiming to be environmental consultants.
Many may benefit from the demands and the confusion surrounding the new
regulations. But others are unlikely to receive authorisation and may face
conflicts between operating as consultants on management systems and as
acting as independent verifiers.
There is also the question of standardisation. Some observers are worried
that the standards applied to verification and accreditation of verifiers
across the EC countries will vary considerably and may devalue the Emas
endorsement.
The green time bomb may be ticking, but its fuse is a long one.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Stagnant rivers and poisoned
seas - Victor Mallet examines Thailand's pollution problems / Worldwide
water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORNCHAI Taranatham remembers the boyhood pleasures of catching fish in
Bangkok from the Chao Phraya river. 'Thirty years ago it was easy,' he says.
'When I was in high school we could walk along the river and get shrimp and
big fish. Not any more.'
As deputy director-general of Thailand's pollution control department, he is
painfully aware that many years will pass before the Chao Phraya can be
restored to its former state.
Nowadays the water in Bangkok's famous klongs (canals) is black and
foul-smelling. The Chao Phraya, which drains most of the country's central
plain, is heavily polluted with sewage and industrial waste. 'The oxygen in
the Chao Phraya is going down and down,' says Pornchai. Dissolved oxygen
levels near the port at Klong Toey are consistently close to zero and
species of fish found a decade ago have disappeared from the lower reaches
of the river.
The river spews its filth into the Gulf of Thailand. At the estuary, a
mangrove swamp - preserved only because it is in the grounds of a Buddhist
temple - is festooned with rubbish thrown in the river by the citizens of
Bangkok.
Further south, the sewage dumped into the sea by the tourist resort of
Pattaya has earned the city international notoriety as one of the most
disgusting bathing spots in the world. On the other side of the Gulf,
mafiosi-style businessmen have shamelessly destroyed acres of wetlands in
the 'Three Hundred Peaks' national park to establish prawn farms.
Thailand in the 1990s is a vivid Asian example of how rapid
industrialisation, uncontrolled urbanisation and unchecked tourism growth
can hurt the environment to such an extent that the foundations of economic
growth - including some of the businesses responsible for the damage in the
first place - are threatened.
The tourism industry is stagnant, partly because potential visitors are
deterred by traffic jams and air pollution in Bangkok and dirty sea water in
resorts such as Pattaya. Thai fishermen unable to catch enough fish in the
Gulf of Thailand - due to overfishing and the destruction of breeding
grounds - encroach on the waters of nearby Vietnam or have converted their
boats into mini-tankers for smuggling diesel from Singapore.
Factories too have been affected. Last year, Phoenix Pulp and Paper was
forced by the government to close its plant in north-east Thailand for six
weeks after it polluted a river. A nearby sugar mill was also temporarily
shut down after water used to put out a fire there washed molasses into the
river and killed thousands of fish.
The importance of husbanding fresh water resources is being brought home to
the people of Bangkok this year by official warnings that low water levels
at two important dams may make it impossible to meet all demands for water
from farmers, industrialists and householders in central Thailand in the dry
weeks before May's monsoon rains. A controversy over whether to blame the
water shortage on climatic cycles or on environmental degradation - such as
the deforestation of watersheds - has yet to be resolved.
As Thailand gets richer and its urban, middle-class citizens more vocal in
their demands for a higher quality of life, governments in Bangkok have
slowly started tightening environmental legislation and allocating money to
water projects.
Only about 2 per cent of Bangkok households are connected to a sewage
treatment system and much of the waste from the city's 7m inhabitants goes
straight into the Chao Phraya. The government and the Bangkok Metropolitan
Authority have, therefore, embarked on a Dollars 800m (Pounds 555.5m)
project to build sewage treatment plants, which should eventually process
three-quarters of domestic waste. Such projects are not confined to Bangkok.
Municipal workers in the resort of Patong on the island of Phuket are
building a main sewer to link more houses and hotels to the town's expanding
waste water treatment plant.
Foreign companies with international images to protect and worldwide company
standards to enforce are taking the lead in adopting environmentally
friendly practices in resorts such as Phuket. The Holiday Inn on Patong
Beach has a waste water treatment plant, uses recycled water for irrigating
the garden and has water-saving aerators fitted to all taps and showers.
Tourism's importance to Thailand, and the damage inflicted on the industry
by environmental destruction, was underlined by the recent decision to
declare Pattaya and Phuket pollution control and environmental protection
zones.
Unfortunately, the problem in Thailand is not a shortage of regulations but
a lack of enforcement. To outsiders, it is surprising how many Thai
officials say the fear of assassination by business gangsters is an obstacle
to the implementation of green legislation.
Pornchai says the pollution control department cannot fill staff vacancies
because anyone qualified could earn three times as much in the private
sector.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Management: Are you driving a good bargain? - John Griffiths
answers questions on company cars raised by tax changes in this month's UK
Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Q: A new system for taxing company cars comes into effect from April 6 1994.
What are its most significant features?
A: The most significant is that the amount of tax paid by individuals on
their company car will be based wholly on a percentage of the manufacturer's
'list' price, or recommended retail price. The current system comprises five
scale charge bands, at the lower end of which are three determined by engine
size with the other two - for executive and luxury cars - defined by the
original market value of the car. These will remain in place during the
financial year 1993-94.
As a result of the change there will no longer be any benefit to an employee
if his or her company negotiates a discount with the manufacturer (a common
practice at the moment which can help put the car into a cheaper scale
charge band).
Under the new rules an individual will pay tax on 35 per cent, 23.3 per cent
or 11.2 per cent of a car's list price, depending on whether he or she
covers less than 2,500 business miles, 2,500 to 18,000, or more than 18,000
miles respectively.
This plays havoc with the tax bills of distinct categories of drivers who
are clearly under-taxed at the moment. Most notable are executives driving
well-equipped cars with prices deliberately pitched just below the current
price band thresholds of Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000, above which the
scale charge rises significantly. There are estimated to be several hundred
thousand drivers of these 'tax break specials'.
Currently they pay the same scale charge as someone driving a basic, 1.6
litre 'sales rep' car costing Pounds 7,000 less. This is because the lower
bands - under 1.4 litres, 1.4 to 2 litres and over 2 litres - are based
solely on engine size. It is these drivers who face scale charge increases
of up to 60 per cent under the list price system and for whom, says Brian
Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit Consulting, 'a cash alternative
will now be a lot more attractive'.
Q: We have delayed replacing our company cars because of recession but many
are now high mileage and will have to be changed during 1993-94, when the
current banded scale charge system will still apply. What pitfalls should we
look out for in replacing these cars? Are there some cars which, though
currently tax effective, would incur significant penalties - for employer or
employee - under the new system?
A: Executives driving 'tax break specials' should think hard about whether
the perceived status of their existing cars is worth the substantial extra
tax penalty involved from next year.
What these charges will be can be seen in the two right-hand graphs, which
plot the incoming list price system against 1993-94 scale charge bands for
drivers in the 'perk' car category (under 2,500 business miles) and for the
majority of company car drivers, namely those covering between 2,500 and
18,000 business miles. (Mileage bands will be carried over from the current
system.) For example, a driver who runs a Pounds 19,000 car, under 2 litres,
will have to trade down to a car costing around Pounds 12,500 if he wishes
to avoid an increased tax bill.
Companies should clearly encourage this sort of reassessment, because the
lower the list price the lower the company's own costs, including pro rata
National Insurance Contribution reductions.
There is, incidentally, no tax advantage in buying a nearly new car of high
specification instead of a cheaper new one; the new legislation taxes cars
up to four years old in the same way as new ones.
Nor is there much point in hoping for change in succeeding Budgets. A basic
requirement of the new system was that it should be self-adjusting, thus
ending for the motor industry those traditional pre-Budget sales droughts
caused by uncertainty. As list prices drift up post-1994, percentage scale
charges will automatically drift up with them.
At the top of the market - cars above Pounds 40,000 - there is nothing but
misery in store for drivers and manufacturers. Rolls-Royce is already
appealing to the government to 'cap' the scale charge above a certain price
level. It is not hard to see why: the scale charge for 1993-94 on a 'perk'
user of a car costing more than Pounds 29,000 will be Pounds 15,060, no
matter how expensive it is. From 1994-95 the scale charge on a Pounds
100,000 Rolls will be Pounds 35,000.
Critics say the new system could destroy the 'supercar' market embodied by
vehicles such as Jaguar's Pounds 415,000 XJ220, which will incur a scale
charge of nearly Pounds 150,000 as a 'perk'.
Q: Is the new system likely to affect the structure of the new car market,
in particular prices and their rate of increase?
A: According to Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff
Business School, the new system could strike 'a bigger blow for the
convergence of car prices in Europe than anything the EC has done'.
Under the current banding system, whether the employer has obtained a
discount on car purchases has not mattered much to drivers of cheaper
company car drivers because their tax scale charge is determined by engine
capacity. 'Tax break special' drivers have usually benefited, in that a
discount may have helped squeeze a car into a lower tax band.
But because the 1994 scheme will be based strictly on published list prices,
ignoring all discounts, employees and employers will for the first time have
a united interest in seeing list prices kept as low as possible. Inevitably
this will strengthen the current trend towards lower dealer margins -
Vauxhall, Peugeot, Rover and latterly Ford have cut their dealers' margins
to 10 per cent on some models, from the usual 16-17 per cent. Their scope
for haggling will be reduced.
But analysts such as Stewart Whyte, director of the Fleet Audits Consultancy
and spokesman for the 500-member Association of Car Fleet Operators, are
united in thinking it will also change the structure of manufacturers'
product offerings and mark the return of cheap 'no-frills' cars, devoid of
any extras, which were once the hallmark of the UK 'reps' car market of the
1960s.
Q: We are considering 'buying out' our company cars with the offer of a cash
alternative. What factors need to be taken into account in arriving at a
fair valuation? Are there general guidelines or does each employee's
circumstances need to be taken into account?
A: The main cost ingredients of running a car, for both company and private
motorist, are set out in the top left-hand chart. The buy-out decision
requires complex calculations involving variables such as the mix of
business mileage to private, cost of finance, foregone interest, mileage
rate for use of private car on business.
Just how difficult even some of the most sophisticated companies have found
it to calculate cash compensation can be seen in the wide variation in
valuations contained in the other table.
A number of tax consultancies have recently developed complex computer
models for making these evaluations. But the cost of running a company's
entire fleet through them could be substantial.
Q: This has been a harsh recession in which thousands of companies have
closed and nearly 2m jobs lost. Our employees are lucky to be in work. Why
shouldn't we get rid of 'perk' cars with no, or only partial, compensation?
A: In most cases, the right to a car of a certain specification is likely to
be contained in contracts of employment. Its withdrawal without agreed
compensation would represent a change in terms and conditions of employment
tantamount to constructive dismissal. Receivers remain bemused by how many
companies are still going under with uncut, self-indulgent car fleets.

FT  31 MAR 93 / People: Clear-out of RHM board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomkins, the new owner of Ranks Hovis McDougall, has not wasted much time
sorting out the wheat from the chaff in the old RHM boardroom. It has
dispensed with the services of all but one member of the old RHM board.
The following RHM directors have resigned: former chairman Stanley Metcalfe,
60; managing director Paul Coker, 54; finance director David Hankinson, 53;
and Pat Metaxa, 60. However, Sir Peter Reynolds, 63, a former chairman,
remains on the RHM board.
Except for Hankinson, who only joined the board last October, the departing
directors are RHM veterans. Metcalfe joined the group in 1956 as a
management trainee, Metaxa in 1962 as a wheat buyer, and Coker came into the
group via Cerebos which he joined in 1964. All of them had lengthy service
contracts and so will be due substantial compensation for loss of office.
Metcalfe, for example, has four more years of his Pounds 347,000 a year
contract to run.
Tomkins' Bob Muddimer, who has been in day-to-day control of RHM since just
before Christmas, has been appointed RHM chairman. Apart from Tomkins'
Dennis Mulhall, who is RHM's chief financial officer, the vast majority of
RHM's senior managers are still running the business.

FT  31 MAR 93 / People: White reinstates his old job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alliance &amp; Leicester has reinstated its post of managing director for
building societies operations as part of its transition towards providing
more banking services.
The society, the third biggest by asset size, has appointed Kevin Southwood,
an executive director of Northern Rock Building Society, to the post made
vacant two years ago when Peter White moved up to become chief executive.
White has spent his time since then mending weaknesses such as the society's
exposure to commercial property lending. He has also overseen changes at
Girobank, which was acquired by Alliance &amp; Leicester in 1989.
Fred Crawley, the society's chairman, says the change to the management
reflected the eventual plan to integrate Girobank into the mainstream
building society business and spread access to services such as telephone
banking.
He says Southwood (left), whose society's results were among the best for
1992, would 'bring a lot of energy and innovative thinking' which would help
the society in its move towards becoming more like a personal bank.
Southwood, 42, becomes managing director designate on April 5. He joined
Northern Rock in 1975 and became head of policy planning and general manager
before being appointed executive director in 1990.

FT  31 MAR 93 / People: Welsh Water to split top roles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh Water, Wales' largest company, is to be run by two non-Welsh speakers.
John Elfed Jones, chairman of the Welsh Language Board as well as chairman
of the water company for the past 11 years, is to be replaced, but on a
part-time basis, by Iain Evans, founder and chairman of London-based
consultancy LEK, who steps up from the position of deputy chairman.
Now that the roles of chairman and chief executive are to be split, Graham
Hawker (right), group managing director, becomes chief executive.
Evans (left), a Harvard MBA and ex-Bain partner, went on the board in 1989
at the request of the then secretary of state for Wales, Peter Walker, to
help the company's relationship with the City during privatisation.
Meanwhile, 41-year-old Evans is defensive about LEK's advisory role in
connection with the controversial stake in South Wales Electricity. The
stake, raised to 14.9 per cent, generated much animosity with South Wales
treating it as a hostile move. But Evans points out LEK's advice that the
shares were undervalued was apparently vindicated when the stake generated a
profit of Pounds 17m when sold last December.
'We may have moved a bit before our time, but as regulators get steadily
tougher on pricing, there will have to be rationalisation between such areas
as water and electricity,' says Evans, who wants a 'sharper definition' of
the utility's non-regulated activities.
Hawker, 45, the son of a miner from the valleys who is now listening to
Welsh tapes in his car, has been at Welsh Water since it was established in
1974. Starting off in internal audit, he rose to finance director before
becoming group managing director last year. Evans says he is also making
'futile efforts' to learn Welsh, and stresses that the company's bilingual
policies will not change.

departed in December over policy differences.
Barber, who has been with the company since leaving Oxford in 1977, returned

changed shape considerably, with Charles Brady, based in Atlanta, Georgia,
from where the bulk of the investment manager's assets now derive, taking

FT  31 MAR 93 / Jobs: So if you think you've a better claim . . . - How an
insufficiently impressionable candidate finally grasped the nettle, and got
stung
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'HOW about me?' the Jobs column asked Suzanne Lawrence. It certainly stopped
her in her tracks - which pleased me, because any less dramatic effect would
have been ego-puncturing. After all, in 20 years of being asked by
recruiters to pass on offers of jobs to the FT's readers, I'd never before
suggested myself as a candidate.
The case, however, was not so much an exception as a near-miracle of
coincidence.
Suzanne edits two magazines: Personnel Management published at the start of
each month, and PM Plus which comes out mid-monthly. Having first joined the
PM title at the same time as I joined this paper, October 1968, she has been
thinking of giving up her editing role to develop new ventures for her
company, of which she is part-owner. She has now finally decided to do so,
and is seeking a successor as editor.
In synchronisation with her again, I've also grasped a nettle. Being only 13
months short of the FT's retirement age of 62, I have broached the matter
with my boss. The result is that while the Jobs column will go on, hopefully
for ever, its last appearance under the present writer will be in the week
ending February 4 at the latest, although accumulated holiday would allow my
departure to be brought forward.
The experience is a bit like first being seriously shot at. However much you
have thought about it in advance, you can't know what your reaction will be
until it actually happens. Mine has been to feel even less decisive now a
date is set than I felt beforehand. In particular, doubts as to whether I
want to stop being a journalist are equalled only by uncertainty as to
whether I want to go on being one.
In such circumstances, of course, it is tempting to leave things to fate. So
while Suzanne was telling me about the job to be done by her successor, I
upped and suggested my aged self just to see what transpired.
As reported, it took her aback. But after a minute of wild-eyed silence, she
recovered beautifully. 'I'd welcome you as a candidate,' she said. 'But I
suspect that my co-selectors are thinking of someone a bit more
impressionable.'
Even so, in case any less unimpressionable readers want to try for the
editorship, I'll outline some other things it calls for.
Diplomatic skills are among them since, while the magazines are produced at
arms-length by the London-based Personnel Publications company, both are
published under contract with Britain's Institute of Personnel Management.
And as a dozen staff are involved in producing them, it would help to have a
bit more team-leadership experience than has come the Jobs column's way - to
date, at least.
There are, however, a couple of things in which candidates might usefully
match me. One is practice at business journalism. Another is a keen interest
not only in the various aspects of what is now fashionably known as human

OW to the table below which gives the latest indicators of management pay in
Britain as shown by the six-monthly surveys of the Reward consultancy. The
most recent covers nearly 21,000 managerial staff employed by about 1,100
varied organisations across the United Kingdom.
Anyone wanting the full report, which is priced at Pounds 200, should
contact Steve Flather of Reward at Diamond Way, Stone Business Park,
Staffordshire ST15 0SD; tel (0)785 813566, fax 817007. Although the study
includes six ranks, my table is confined to just one - executives
immediately below board level. In all cases, two pay figures are given:
basic salary then total money rewards.
The lower quartile figures refer to the manager who would be a quarter way
up from the foot of a ranking of all doing similar work, the medians to the
one ranked half-way, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down
from the top. The table's right-hand column shows the percentages of all the
executives in each job category who have company cars.
To allow for increases between the collection of data and April 1, Reward
says the pay figures should be upped by 0.53 per cent, and by a further 3.5
per cent for each month thereafter.
Regional variations from the overall median of Pounds 31,000 were: Higher -
London by 17.8 per cent, Scotland by 6.4, Northern Ireland by 4.2, and
south-east England by 2.7. Lower - south-west by 3.5 per cent, north-west by
4.0, west midlands by 4.6, and eastern counties and north-east by 9.7.
Variances from the median by employer's sales turnover were: Higher - Pounds
500m-plus by 53 per cent, Pounds 200m-Pounds 500m by 16.7, Pounds
100m-Pounds 200m by 9.7, and Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m by 4.0. Lower - Pounds

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind plea for rotation of UN
forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM RIFKIND last night said forces for United Nations operations,
such as in Bosnia, should alternate regularly between countries as he voiced
alarm among ministers at the cost of Britain's overseas defence commitments.
The defence secretary said the UN needed to find 'a better way of sharing
the burden'. Countries should commit forces for a finite period with a clear
understanding that they would then be replaced by an equivalent force from
another country, he said.
Speaking at a Tory Reform Group meeting in London, Mr Rifkind hinted that if
Britain were to join a UN peace-keeping operation in Bosnia, the government
would insist on such a rotation scheme being in place. He noted that UK
forces have been in Cyprus for 30 years.
His speech reflected concern among cabinet ministers at the financial and
human costs of Britain's already-limited involvement in Bosnia, and their
frustration at the apparent reluctance of other countries to become
involved. Most Conservative MPs would resist any substantial expansion of
the UK role in the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has set out his concern at the
implications of the UN's expanding operations. So far, however, lobbying
among other countries for a change in UN procedures has been kept relatively
low key.
Mr Rifkind said his proposals would encourage other countries to join UN
operations by ending their fears of being sucked into an open-ended
commitment.
He said Bosnia was 'a snapshot of the kind of hugely complex, politically
fraught, multinational operation which will increasingly face us in the
future.
'The dividing line between pure defence and humanitarian aims will become
increasingly blurred, with important implications for public pressure on us
to get involved.'
Britain would need 'from time to time' to stand out against the use of
force, Mr Rifkind said: 'We should not be coy about this - it seems to me
entirely honest and defensible that we should avoid entanglement in a
military operation which we believe is unwise or ill-conceived.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith senses schism over future
voting plan - Labour is still warring over PR as the Plant committee
concludes its inquiry today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE senior Labour party official, the dilemma was simple: 'How can you be
a party of change and not change on PR?
If you do opt for change, how do you counter the Tory argument that you
don't believe you can win an election by the present system?'
If he were not so before, Mr John Smith, Labour's leader, must now be aware
that the potentially explosive electoral reform issue could split his party
as damagingly as Maastricht has divided the Tories.
Today, as Lord Plant's exhaustive three-year trawl through the issues
involved comes to its formal end, the fierce disagreements within his
18-member working party are about the only element in the equation not in
dispute.
Another might be that the only game in town is what happens to the House of
Commons. Even opponents of any change from first-past-the-post for MPs, like
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, can probably live with alternatives
for Europe, local government, Scotland and the Lords. But when it comes to
the lower chamber, schism is in the air.
Lord Plant, a politics professor from Southampton University, has always
said that his warring colleagues must table a report with recommendations.
But with committee members split three ways between three systems, it
appears clear there is no outright majority for any one.
So how is a conclusion reached? Lord Plant - now regarded as firmly in the
reformist camp - is expected to insist that members first vote for or
against change. Some, Mrs Beckett once again is one, may strenuously object
as such a vote would almost certainly produce a majority for change. But
what change? Neither of the two hybrid systems on offer - Supplementary Vote
and the Mixed Member System - can command a majority of the committee.
One insider said: 'The first hour and half of the meeting will probably be
spent arguing how the vote on the committee is going to be taken.'
The protests of advocates of first-past-the-post must also be accommodated,
probably requiring a further 'final' drafting meeting before the finished
report is sent on to the National Executive Committee's meeting at the end
of April.
Party officials have hinted that Mr Smith, a known sceptic about change,
must make his own views known by then. He may do so only privately. As the
ultimate decisions still lie with party conference, the key battles now lie,
as so often, within the executive committees of the big unions.
Mr Bill Morris, the Transport Union's general secretary, surprised many last
year when he came out for reform. His executive, however, is not yet with
certainty in the reformers' bag. Similar hints of flexibility have come from
the highly influential GMB general union which is said to have pledged to do
what Mr Smith wants.
So what does Mr Smith want? The simple answer is to win the next election.
Even if that can only be achieved by having Mr Paddy Ashdown as his deputy,
Mr Smith might swallow hard and bear it - though never publicly in a pact.
But he is said to be unconvinced that Labour has a better chance as an
electoral reforming party than not.
If Mr Smith comes out firmly against change, he can be sure the reformers'
campaign will continue.
One final option, mooted recently, is to promise a referendum on the issue,
along the lines of the recent plebiscite in New Zealand. But that might
prove awkward at a time when Labour is so adamantly opposed to a referendum
on Maastricht.
Mr Smith might just be tempted to do what Labour leaders are traditionally
least naturally disposed to do - let the conference decide, then try and
make the decision stick.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo snubs probe into social
security cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Portillo has delivered a snub to the influential social security
select committee by turning down its request to contribute to its inquiry
into the government's long-term public spending review.
In a letter to Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the cross-party
body, the chief secretary to the Treasury said he did not think it
'appropriate' for him to attend the committee to discuss a matter for which
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, had 'prime responsibility'.
Mr Portillo said: 'As I made clear to the House, the public expenditure
reviews will be the responsibility of the relevant departments.'
The Treasury last night said it was 'very unusual' for ministers to appear
before committees that did not directly cover their departments.
Mr Lilley is due to appear before the committee next month, when he is
expected to respond to questions on both the public spending review and the
impact on the worst-off of extending value added tax to domestic fuel, as
proposed in the Budget.
The committee decided to conduct this separate inquiry earlier this month in
spite of the reservations of some of its Tory members.
It is understood that the body - which could be taking evidence at about the
same time as the Commons is dealing with the VAT measure in the detailed
discussions on the Finance Bill - has not yet decided whether to press
further for the involvement of a Treasury minister in either or both
inquiries.
In his letter Mr Portillo also declined to make Treasury papers available to
the committee. There were no published Treasury documents associated with
the reviews and advice from officials 'has to remain confidential', he said.
Announcing the reviews in February, the chief secretary indicated the
government would look initially at health, social security, education and
Home Office budgets. He said the government would be seeking to identify
areas where better targeting could be achieved or from which it could
'withdraw altogether.' No spending was sacrosanct.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd rejects suggestions that EC
delays added to tragedy in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, last night rejected suggestions by
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, that delay by the European
Community in agreeing a common policy in response to the break-up of
Yugoslavia added to the tragedy in Bosnia, Ivor Owen writes.
Time taken to resolve the dispute within the EC over according diplomatic
recognition to Croatia and Slovenia - finally granted in January of this
year - had not been decisive in what followed, he said.
Mr Hurd emphasised that while Lady Thatcher believed that recognition was
given too late, Lord Carrington, the former foreign secretary, who led the
EC's initial pacification attempts, thought it was granted too soon.
'I do not think it would have made sense to have withheld recognition for
much longer, or that the timing of recognition had much impact on the
tragedy in Bosnia which followed,' Mr Hurd said.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Inquiry launched into party funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SWEEPING Commons' inquiry into the funding of political parties was
launched yesterday. It is set to investigate the Conservative party's links
with businesses and Labour's with trade unions.
The cross-party Home Affairs committee has called for evidence from the
treasurers of every party represented in the House of Commons.
The investigation will examine the case for and against the state funding of
political parties, as well as the methods by which parties are financed at
present. The MPs will also look at whether there should be greater legal
control over political parties' sources of finance.
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrat parties fought the last election on
manifestos calling for greater state aid for political parties.
Among Labour MPs the question of state funding of political parties has
become an issue because of the leadership's determination to weaken its
links with the trade unions - a move likely to lead to a fall in union
donations.
The Conservative party hierarchy has resisted pressure for a greater
disclosure of details of its donors but if officials from the party are
required to give evidence they could be pressed to reveal more information
about sources of finance. Some Tory activists want greater openness.
The government already gives limited financial support to the work of
opposition political parties at Westminster, but the last review was after
the 1987 election and the money is related to parliamentary activities
rather than general campaigning.
Some MPs on the committee are concerned that political parties should have
sufficient funds to perform their duties. The committee could decide to
study the extent to which other European countries provide financial support
to political parties.
The Home Affairs committee, chaired by Sir Ivan Lawrence, Conservative MP
for Burton, will also take evidence from the Confederation of British
Industry, the Trades Union Congress and other interested groups, as well as
the Green Party.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pension reform report delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, announced yesterday that the
conclusion of the review he set up into pension law after the raiding of
Maxwell funds has been delayed by three months until September.
The hold up, caused by the volume of evidence the inquiry has received, will
lead to a corresponding delay before the government announces which of the
review's proposals it intends to accept.
Legislation on pension reform in the session of parliament starting in
October is now ruled out. Instead, the government will probably introduce a
pension reform bill in the 1994-95 session.
Mr Lilley could decide to delay his plans for equalising male and female
state retirement ages - currently expected in the next session of parliament
 -by a further year so they can be included in the same bill.
It still seems probable, however, that pensions equalisation will be
introduced separately, if only because of the size of a joint bill.
A final decision on the timing of legislation will depend on the competition
between departments to win slots in the already-crowded legislative
programme.
Mr Lilley said the extra time for the Pension Law Review Committee had been
requested by Professor Roy Goode, the committee's chairman, who is analysing
the contents of 1,700 written submissions, seven days of hearings and three
public meetings.
Last June Mr Lilley told MPs that the inquiry would report within 12 months
but his announcement yesterday extends the deadline until September 30.
A period of consultation will follow before the government's legislative
proposals are announced.
Prof Goode said the committee had been working 'strenuously' to meet the
deadline but now had a 'a much clearer picture of the range and complexity
of the task'.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Straw targets costs in council tax
attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR launched its local election campaign yesterday, taking the battle to
what is seen as traditionally Tory ground, with the claim that average
council tax bills under Labour councils were Pounds 14 less than average
bills under Tory councils.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, focused on the level of
services provided by Labour county councils, high provision of nursery
education and free home helps.
'The old Tory canard that Labour costs you more has gone. Labour costs you
less and it is going to serve you better,' he said.
The Tories retaliated swiftly, pointing out that Labour's figures were not
an indication of relative efficiency or value for money.
Instead, they said, the average figures reflected the fact that more
properties in Labour areas were in lower bands, and would be bound to pay
less than more highly-valued properties, since that was the basis of the
council tax.
The Tory campaign for the 47 county councils in England and Wales begins
today, but electioneering has already spilled over into the Commons.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was attacked in the Commons by Labour
over the way government grant is distributed among local councils.
He retorted by reciting the 10 (Labour) councils charging the highest
amounts for a particular band of property, and those (Tory or independent)
charging the least.
While Labour is the largest party in local government overall, it controls
13 county councils compared with the Tories' 19.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, said the party would not step
down anywhere to give Liberal Democrat candidates a clearer run.
Local authorities must review their compulsory competitive tendering
practices to make them more responsive to consumers, according to an Audit
Commission report published today.
The local government watchdog says some services that are contracted out are
breaking down or of a poor standard. In a survey of 150 schools, a third
expressed dissatisfaction with services such as cleaning and catering
supplied by contractors.

MR Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock in Essex, said last night he
believed staff at West Thurrock power station would be told today it was to
close with the loss of hundreds of jobs.
'If these rumours are untrue, National Power should reassure the workforce
immediately,' he said. 'But I fear they are true. The inevitable consequence
of privatisation of energy in this country is that jobs would be lost.'
National Power, which has already closed several power stations, would not
confirm or deny the reports last night but added that the company 'has said
it would address the problem of overcapacity'.

The bill, which is due to become law before parliament's summer recess, has

While most amendments have been tabled by opposition members and peers,
employers' organisations have been anxious about the burdens imposed by some

face - Michael Smith on the cut-throat rivalry as pits compete for a place
in the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH

<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine was unequivocal. The future of the 12 reprieved pits
would not be secured at the expense of the remaining 19, the trade secretary
told MPs on Monday.
But, as the effects of the government's Commons victory on coal began to
sink in yesterday, British Coal managers were less comforting about the
future of the 19 which employ more than 15,000 people.
'If we cannot secure a market for all 31 pits - and it is scarcely likely
that we will - there are no guarantees for any of them,' said one executive.
'If we gave guarantees we would lay ourselves open to all kinds of legal
problems.'
A manager at one of the reprieved 12 said he and the miners at his colliery
were embroiled in a battle for survival in competition with the other 30
mines. 'There has always been friendly rivalry but now it is going to be a
cut-throat business.
'I have set my objectives to be one of the survivors. But if I do it can
only be at the expense of another mine, either one of the reprieved or one
of the 19.'
His argument rests on the widespread belief in British Coal that there is
not enough room in the market to sustain the 31 (rising to 32 when Asfordby
starts production) under British Coal's ownership beyond the end of this
year.
After last Thursday's white paper, British Coal committed itself to 'market
testing', mainly through trying to sign additional contracts with
electricity generators.
But few in the organisation believe that this will yield the additional 25m
tonnes needed in 1994-95 to sustain all 31 pits, let alone an additional six
which have been mothballed and a seventh where development work will
continue but large scale mining will cease.
This means that some mines are likely to close or be sold to the private
sector in nine months to a year. But which pits are most vulnerable?
Some of the mothballed mines may exist longer than others because of British
Coal's desire for reserves. Those apart, the pits with the largest question
marks against their names are the 12 on the reprieved list.
However, some of them could leapfrog the 19 on the survival list through a
relatively small performance improvement.
Take Rufford Colliery, near Mansfield. According to John T Boyd, the US
consultancy hired by the government to assess the efficiency of all pits, it
could market coal at Pounds 1.40 a gigajoule by 1995-96, a projected loss of
3 pence per gigajoule if new working practices are introduced.
That is already better than Boyd's projections for Ellington, in the
north-east of England, one of the 19 with an apparently more secure future.
It could market coal at Pounds 1.28 per gigajoule and a loss of 29p.
Rufford has only a slightly less rosy future than Tower colliery in south
Wales, second to bottom on the Boyd list of 19, which could market coal at
Pounds 1.55 and a profit of 9p.
This is not to say that Rufford will replace Ellington or Tower on the list
of most likely survivors, even if it does perform better than expected.
First, British Coal will probably be making closure decisions from later
this year onwards and Boyd's projections refer to two years hence.
Other factors will influence closures, including pits' proximity to power
stations and their level of reserves.
The closeness of the figures demonstrates one reason why there is no fixed
line between the 19 and the 12, especially for those ranked by Boyd at the
bottom and top of each list.
Legal considerations are as important. British Coal had its fingers burned
in December when the High Court ruled it had not consulted widely enough
before determining the first 10 pits to close.
It was told that the closure decisions should be subject to independent
scrutiny and it was suggested that Boyd could provide that role.
The two thick books of assessments have supplied the unions or anyone else
wanting to dispute closure decisions with a mass of information. 'We do not
want to get into the legal problems we suffered in December,' says one
British Coal executive. 'We will have to be - and to be seen to be -
scrupulously fair.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM pressed over fishing row as
truce holds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEMPORARY, if fragile, truce in the dispute between the UK and France over
fisheries appeared to be holding last night after French fishermen agreed to
a four-week 'cooling off period' in disputed fishing grounds off the Channel
Islands.
There were no reports last night of fresh incidents in and around the
Guernsey capital of St Peter Port, although local officials described the
mood of the French fishing ports as 'tense' after a deal they said they had
won was declared invalid by the British government.
French fishermen left St Peter Port late on Monday night. They claimed they
had won an agreement under which they would be allowed to fish in disputed
waters in return for Guernsey boats being allowed to land their fish in the
French ports of Cherbourg and Granville.
However, Mr David Curry, the UK fisheries minister, insisted that there was
an international agreement restricting fishing which the UK and France had
agreed to abide by. 'It really isn't up to private fleets of fishermen . . .
to decide policy on this,' he added.
In the House of Commons, Mr John Major maintained the conciliatory tone of
recent government pronouncements in the face of repeated calls from Tory
backbenchers for a more aggressive response to recent incidents involving
French fishermen and Royal Navy patrol vessels.
Welcoming this week's condemnation of the French fishermen's behaviour by Mr
Bernard Dorin, the French ambassador to London, the prime minister said he
was looking to the French authorities to restore order, bring those
responsible for the incidents to book and guarantee access to French ports
for British produce.
Mr David Harris, Tory MP for St Ives, welcomed Mr Major's remarks but
pressed him to go further, asking that the prime minister 'make it perfectly
clear to the French prime minister that the Royal Navy won't stand idly by
if there is any attempt to repeat the disgraceful incidents of the weekend'.
UK officials yesterday said the situation remained unpredictable because of
the political vacuum in France.
One Royal Navy official said last night: 'Everyone is drawing breath. We
don't want to exacerbate the situation in any way.'

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Work bill faces hurdles in Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EMPLOYMENT bill faces what could be a record number of 300 amendments as
it goes through its committee stage in the House of Lords, David Goodhart
writes.
The bill, which is due to become law before parliament's summer recess, has
already been the subject of dozens of mainly technical amendments at
committee and report stages in the Commons.
Although most amendments have been tabled by opposition members and peers,
Conservative members have also been giving voice to the anxieties of
employers' organisations about the burdens that some measures are imposing.
In the latest significant amendment, inspired by the Confederation of
British Industry, women going on maternity leave will be required to inform
their employer when they are leaving and when they plan to return.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition ready to attack on tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR has begun amassing its ammunition to attack the government over the
changes to direct taxation in the Budget.
It will force ministers to spell out the consequences for different income
groups of the measures announced a fortnight ago.
Some opposition spokesmen are conscious that the row over the decision to
levy Value Added Tax on domestic fuel from next April has distracted
attention from the significant changes to taxes on people's income.
Attention was particularly drawn to the freezing of tax allowances, the one
per cent increase in National Insurance contributions, and cutting to 20 per
cent the rate at which mortgage interest relief can be claimed.
Labour spokesmen are determined to use the detailed discussion on the
finance bill in the Commons to turn the spotlight on how those changes
measure up to the government's pledges on direct taxation. Some of their
colleagues, however, do not believe that the issue will become high-profile
until the NI rises actually take effect in April next year.
The bill is expected to be debated in the Commons at the end of this month,
and there will then be a few days of detailed discussion in which all MPs
can take part before the bill goes for consideration in a committee.
But the introduction of the 20 per cent tax rate and its expansion in this
year's March Budget has meant that altogether, the combined tax and national
insurance liability of the lower half of taxpayers is less under the
proposed regime for 1993-94 than it would have been had the tax regime in
1987-88 been continued.
Answering questions from Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security
secretary, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, said
yesterday that the tax and NI liability for the bottom 20 per cent of
taxpayers was Pounds 1.7bn, compared with indexation of the 1987-88 regime
which would have been Pounds 2.3bn.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Housing scheme exceeds target
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 18,000 homes have been bought by housing associations using the
Pounds 577m allocated in the Autumn Statement for the housing market
package, according to the Housing Corporation which distributed the funds.
The money, which had to be spent by today, helped enable associations to
exceed the government's target for the package by 2,000 homes.
The proportion of homes bought from lenders which had repossessed them was
just 7 per cent of the total. Almost half the homes were bought from
builders and developers, with 44 per cent bought from householders and
others.

THE GOVERNMENT'S 1.5 per cent pay limit in the public sector has won its
first acceptance from two groups of public-sector employees.
The Education Institute of Scotland, representing about 45,000 Scottish
teachers, accepted the deal at the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee, and
about 10,000 Royal Mail managers have also formally endorsed the offer.
Few unions are strongly resisting the public-sector pay squeeze but most are
also refusing to accept it formally.

FT  31 MAR 93 / American Airlines joins fares war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Airlines triggered another round of transatlantic price cuts
yesterday by trimming another Pounds 10 from its economy fares between the
UK and the US. Its London to New York fare is now Pounds 249. It is also
offering Pounds 30 return fares for onward flights to some other US cities,
Daniel Green writes.
The cuts follow reductions announced last week by all the main airlines
linking the US and the UK. BA and Virgin Atlantic said they would not change
their tariffs in response to the move.
Virgin's fare is already Pounds 249, and BA said its Pounds 259 fare
includes a Pounds 10 security charge that is extra on the other airlines.
Virgin conceded that its customers pay Pounds 10 more than the published
fare.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Trade unions see membership fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERSHIP of all independent trade unions fell by more than 320,000 in 1991
to just under 9.5m, while union assets increased by Pounds 26m to Pounds
661m in the same period, the Certification Office, which regulates the
activities of unions and employers' organisations, says.
In its annual report the office says gross income for unions increased 10.3
per cent to Pounds 619.6m in 1991 while gross expenditure rose to Pounds
597.9m. The average annual contribution per union member was Pounds 53.22p.
The gross income of employers' associations rose 9.5 per cent to Pounds 165m
with expenditure increasing by about the same amount to Pounds 157m.
The number of members of TUC-affiliated unions is about 7.7m, so nearly 2m
union members are in non-TUC unions. The only two unions to grow in 1991
were Nalgo, the local government union, which grew 16,000 to 760,000, and
the teachers' union NASUWT which grew 11,000 to 180,000.
More than Pounds 4m was paid to unions last year by the office under the
statutory ballot refund scheme, which covers most of the cost of ballots and
which is being phased out over the next three years.
The office refused a certificate of independence to the staff association
formed at the GCHQ government communications centre after the banning of
TUC-affiliated Civil Service unions at the centre. The Employment Appeal
Tribunal upheld the office's decision.

FT  31 MAR 93 / BT signs Pounds 40m supply deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications and Racal-Datacom yesterday announced a strategic
alliance that could be worth up to Pounds 40m over three years to the data
communications company based in Reading, Berkshire.
Racal-Datacom has been named as BT's preferred supplier of networking
equipment and accompanying support services. The equipment involved in the
deal will include modems which enable computers to talk to each other over
telephone lines, multiplexers which enable several computers to share the
same telephone line simultaneously, and devices for integrated services
digital networks (ISDN), the most advanced data communications technology.
First product shipments are expected in June this year.
Mr Adam Scott, BT customer equipment director, said it was the most
important alliance so far in its sector.
Mr Tim Holley, Racal-Datacom group chairman, said the deal encompassed
everything from a simple link between two personal computers costing Pounds
1,000 to a multi-million-pound international network.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Economic consultancy says manufacturing output to stage
robust recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING output will stage a robust recovery this year and next but the
consequent economic upturn will be patchy and too weak to cut unemployment
in 1993, says Oxford Economic Forecasting, an economic consultancy, Peter
Norman writes.
In its half-yearly review of UK industrial prospects, the consultancy says a
rise in net exports this year and rising investment will lift manufacturing
output while services lag.
Capital goods industries such as engineering and vehicles will spearhead the
recovery, while the chemical, textile and clothing industries will receive a
temporary boost from improved competitiveness provided by the devaluation of
sterling.
The consultancy says longer-term prospects for metals, basic chemicals and
textiles are poor because of low-cost foreign competition.
Construction output will continue to fall because of overcapacity in the
commercial property market. In the energy sector, rising oil and gas
production will outweigh sharp declines in coal output.
The review sees no strong recovery in consumer spending. Although there may
be some growth in high-priced items, the consultancy expects that expansion
of the leisure goods and services, distribution, and retail financial
services sectors will be much reduced in the 1990s.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Finance community in shock: James Buxton reports on the
conviction of a Scottish analyst for insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE conviction yesterday of Mr Thorold Mackie for insider dealing was
greeted with shock by many in the Edinburgh financial community last night.
'It's a travesty, it's appalling,' said a bank official who knows him well
and had followed the trial closely.
Mr Mackie, 39, is probably the best-known investment analyst in Scotland and
his fate aroused personal sympathy. It also caused anxiety  - the offence of
which he was found guilty concerned information given by a company chairman
to an investment analyst, routine business in the Edinburgh financial
community.
Although the trial was held at the Court of Session in Edinburgh under
Scottish judicial procedures, the offence was against UK-wide law - the 1985
Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. It was the first case of its
kind in Scotland but the offence could equally have been committed in
England.
The crux of the case against Mr Mackie was that in September 1991 he had
been informed by Mr Peter Runciman, then chairman of the waste disposal
company Shanks &amp; McEwan, that the company was about to issue a profits
warning - a piece of acutely price-sensitive information.
Mr Mackie, it was alleged, then 'counselled and procured' two salesmen in
Bell Lawrie White, the stockbrokers for which he worked, to deal in the
shares. By selling clients' shares ahead of the profits warning the shares
realised Pounds 1.39m more than if they had been sold after the warning.
The trial therefore concerned the passing-on of a specific piece of
price-sensitive information, rather than the more general information a
company might routinely give to an analyst and which might lead to share
dealing.
Mr Mackie said Mr Runciman did not mention a profits warning at their
meeting, only telling him that Shanks &amp; McEwan would enjoy 'little by way of
growth in earnings per share' in that half year, as part of a general
briefing.
As with so many things in Scotland, the trial involved people who know each
other very well. Mr Runciman and Mr Mackie were on first-name terms; both
have fairly high profiles and are respected in the Scottish business and
financial communities. Bell Lawrie White is the leading stockbroker in
Edinburgh.
During the seven-day trial, a series of stockbrokers, analysts and fund
managers from Edinburgh and London - the court heard 21 witnesses in all -
gave evidence against Mr Mackie. Other members of the Edinburgh financial
community dropped in on the Court of Session, the principal court in
Scotland, just off the Royal Mile in the heart of the city, to hear what was
going on.
Few of them, it seems, expected Mr Mackie to be found guilty. The majority
verdict appeared to take even Mr Mackie's legal team by surprise.
Mr Mackie made his name in the tightly knit Scottish financial community -
which concentrates on life assurance, fund management and banking - for
specialising in Scottish quoted companies, of which there are about 60. He
frequently complained that Scotland was producing so few of them.
Until he dropped out of the limelight after being charged with insider
dealing a year ago, he was frequently quoted in the Scottish press and on
the radio.
In court he looked a rather lonely figure, sitting upright on a long bench,
alone except for a policeman at a respectful distance. Flashes of his dry
sense of humour emerged when he went into the witness box on Monday.
Mr Runciman, 64, is an Englishman who was recruited in the early 1980s as a
company doctor to Shanks &amp; McEwan, then a privately owned and ailing Glasgow
company. Through a spectacular purchase of landfill sites from Hanson in
1986 he built the company into one of Britain's biggest waste-disposal
operators and became a very wealthy man after it was listed on the Stock
Exchange in 1988.
A courteous, almost diffident man, he gave evidence in a quiet but
determined way. He retired from Shanks &amp; McEwan at the end of last year, and
is treasurer of the Scottish Conservative party.

FT  31 MAR 93 / 3i may look for outside funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's largest venture capital company, 3i, is considering the possibility
of raising outside finance alongside its own funds to invest in continental
Europe.
The company was anxious to play down the significance of its deliberations.
'We look at all sorts of different ways of fund-raising,' said Mr Neil
Cross, international director. 'We have looked at the possibility of raising
funds to invest alongside our own money over the years. We have been
exploring that again.'
3i has built up a network of offices in France, Germany, Spain and Italy and
is keen to increase its activity at a time when other venture capital
organisations are cutting back. In recent years it has invested Pounds 40m
to Pounds 45m a year in continental Europe.
Traditionally 3i has funded new investments from its own resources and by
making bond issues, and still has considerable liquid funds available, Mr
Cross said. However, the company's dependence on its own resources has
proved a limitation in funding larger deals. Last June it announced an
alliance with Prudential Venture Managers to invest in UK management
buy-outs.
3i's move appears to have emerged from its meetings with US pension funds,
the largest source of venture-capital funds internationally.
It has been preparing for a Stock Exchange listing for several years but the
difficult economic climate has led to delays and speculation among some UK
venture capitalists that the flotation may not take place. Senior 3i
executives have expressed concerns that a flotation which did not raise new
money for the company would serve little purpose.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Boost in business property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE IN the commercial property market has risen markedly, according
to a survey of property lenders.
Nearly three quarters of the 69 banks and financial institutions questioned
by Chesterton Financial, the chartered surveyor, expect an improvement in
the market during the next year. Last July, by contrast, fewer than half the
bankers polled expected a recovery over the following 12 months.
The recovery is thought unlikely to take hold until the autumn. Only 22 per
cent of respondents see an improvement in the next six months.
Lenders were more optimistic about an improvement in the market than at any
time since the survey was started in July 1991. But most property lenders
report growing problems with bad debts. A majority expect the number of
receiverships to rise over the next six months.
The Association of Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce yesterday
criticised the Association of British Insurers and the Department of Trade
and Industry for their response to providing cover for terrorist damage.
Ms Liz Taylor, who chairs the risk managers, said Pool Re, the terrorist
damage insurance pool, had been devised without consultation with clients or
brokers. 'Pool Re has been hastily conceived with considerable government
strictures,' she said, adding that the managing director had few resources
to assist his work.
But she called for support of Pool Re and warned that it might otherwise
founder.

FT  31 MAR 93 / London Transport warns on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S BUSES as well as its Underground will suffer under government
spending cuts in the coming financial year, London Transport warned in its
annual business plan published yesterday.
The plan says London Transport's programme of improvements has had to be
sharply cut because of a 30 per cent reduction in government grant from
Pounds 768m in 1992-93 to Pounds 540m in 1993-94.
Sir Wilfrid Newton, London Transport's chairman, says in the report: 'Having
raised the expectations of passengers, suppliers and staff, London Transport
is now faced with the prospect of cutting back programmes, winding down
project teams and releasing skilled resources.'
One casualty will be an extension to the dot-matrix passenger information
system at bus stops, introduced last November on one route. The system will
now be delayed.
The biggest project still going ahead this year will be the upgrading of the
Central Line, which involves the introduction of new trains and a
resignalling of much of the route. But similar work on the Northern Line has
been postponed.
The planned extension of the Jubilee Line to Docklands remains uncertain
because a funding scheme has still not been agreed with the private sector.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Fifth arrest in Maxwell SFO probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE yesterday arrested and charged a fifth man in connection with the
Serious Fraud Office inquiry into the collapse of the business empire of the
late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr Albert Fuller, the former group treasurer of Maxwell Communication
Corporation, was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud Credit
Suisse bank.
The charge against Mr Fuller also names Mr Robert Maxwell himself - the
first time the late publishing tycoon has appeared on the indictment set to
go before a jury.
The charge alleges that, along with Mr Robert Maxwell, his son Mr Kevin
Maxwell, former adviser Mr Larry Trachtenberg, and Mr Robert Bunn, a finance
director with MCC, Mr Fuller conspired to defraud Credit Suisse by making
dishonest and false representations in share transactions.
The false representations were allegedly made about shares given to Credit
Suisse as security for loans or advances made to the Robert Maxwell group
(formerly known as the Mirror Group plc).
The Robert Maxwell group is alleged to have claimed that the full beneficial
ownership of the shares lay either with itself or with a wholly owned
subsidiary.
Although their names appear on this charge, Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr
Trachtenberg and Mr Bunn have not at this stage been charged with any
offence relating to Credit Suisse.
Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Trachtenberg have both been charged with a number of
theft and conspiracy charges involving Pounds 135m. Mr Ian Maxwell, another
of the late publisher's sons, and Mr Bunn both face single charges of
conspiracy to defraud.
However, in a previous case involving Mr Trachtenberg, SFO lawyers stated
that, in his case, the charges against him are only sample ones and that
more are likely to be brought in the future.
Mr Fuller was arrested and charged at Snow Hill police station in the City
by arrangement with the City of London fraud squad. He was released on bail
to appear at City of London magistrates court tomorrow.
As head of Maxwell Communication Corporation's treasury operation, Mr Fuller
occupied a senior position within the company, but was not on its board of
directors.
It is expected that the trials of the five men will begin in the first half
of next year, although no date has yet been fixed.

FT  31 MAR 93 / The sales campaign that remained a flight of fantasy: Philip
Rawstorne on how Hoover's air travel promotion went horribly wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER yesterday finally admitted that a sales promotion which offered free
air travel was a complete disaster.
The company's offer last year of two free return flights to the US and other
holiday destinations for customers who spent Pounds 100 on its household
appliances set off a commercial chain reaction.
Thousands of shoppers bought washing machines, refrigerators, tumble dryers,
but mostly vacuum cleaners to qualify for free trips across the Atlantic.
Other businesses tried to cash in too. One enterprising carpet company
offered customers spending Pounds 999 in its stores a free Hoover (plus the
two free flights).
Shops throughout the country quickly ran out of Hoover products. The
company's Cambuslang factory was put on seven-day working in an attempt to
cope with the demand.
But newspaper small-ad columns began to fill with offers of unused,
low-priced Hoover appliances which people had bought merely for the free
flights offer.
By the end of the year, Travel Weekly, the trade newspaper, estimated that
buyers of more than 100,000 Hoover appliances were queueing up for free
flights.
Some within the travel industry had by then begun to doubt openly whether
the promotion made commercial sense. On the evidence, they suggested, it was
difficult to see how Hoover could avoid making anything but a heavy loss.
Meanwhile, customers started encountering problems with the offer. Mr Alex
Mills, a Glaswegian, and four relatives who had bought Hoover vacuum
cleaners to get free flights to the Canary Islands, made their applications
in September and had not received any reply three months later.
Mr Reginald Goold of Cornwall got no reply to his application for flights to
Philadelphia until a national newspaper took up his case.
Complaints started to reach the Consumers' Association, the BBC's consumer
programme Watchdog, and many newspapers. Increasing numbers of Hoover
customers reported that the company was not responding to inquiries about
their travel plans.
There were allegations that Hoover was using the small print of its offer to
rid itself of applicants. People who had gained the impression that they
could travel when they liked between certain dates learned that flights were
'subject to availability' and, in the last resort, Hoover was legally able
to specify the date, time and destination of the trips.
The Consumers' Association said that people had been enticed by a clever
marketing ploy and were not getting what they expected.
Trading standards officers protested that the provision of information to
the public by Hoover was 'terrible'.
Hoover constantly refused to disclose how many people had applied for its
offer or how many appliances had been sold. But as the public relations
goodwill the promotion was designed to generate rapidly began to turn sour,
Hoover set up a telephone helpline to cope with customers' inquiries.
JSI Travel, the travel company appointed by Hoover for the promotion,
admitted in December that there had been 'some chaos' but only 'because the
offer has been far more popular than any of us anticipated'.
It said: 'We have received 100,000 applications and expected no more than
half that number.' By December, when Hoover had taken on two more travel
companies to deal with the growing volume of applications, JSI said that
only 900 applicants for European flights had made their trips.
Hoover was reported last month to have bought almost 20,000 air tickets in
an attempt to satisfy customers and defuse the controversy.
According to Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, there is still
a queue of 30,000 Hoover customers waiting for free flights. 'Thousands have
already been disappointed and given up on the offer,' he said.
A task force headed by Robert L. Chaplin, vice-president and controller of
Maytag Corporation, and Richard Rankin, Hoover Europe's vice-president of
marketing, will try to clear up the fiasco.
The company estimates its additional costs for ending the once-promising but
flawed promotional scheme will be Dollars 30m (Pounds 21.1m) or 28 cents a
share - but it may have to pay a heavier price yet for the loss of goodwill.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Employee groups accept pay limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S 1.5 per cent pay limit in the public sector has won its
first acceptance from two groups of public sector employees.
The Education Institute of Scotland, representing about 45,000 Scottish
teachers, accepted the deal at the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee, and
about 10,000 Royal Mail managers have also formally endorsed the offer.
Few unions are strongly resisting the public sector pay squeeze but most are
also refusing to formally accept it, instead having it imposed on their
members.
In the case of the Communications Managers Association, which represents
Royal Mail managers, the offer was put out to ballot and 68 per cent of the
5,600 members voting favoured accepting the offer.
In addition to the basic 1.5 per cent increase some bonus payments were
increased by up to 5 per cent. However, CMA officials have strongly objected
to a Royal Mail statement that managers are 'over-paid and under-bonused'.

produce a new range of MG sports cars.
Both Rover, the motor vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, and Mayflower
refused officially to confirm the project yesterday.
But Mayflower admitted that it was 'at an advanced stage of negotiation' for
a significant contract for the design, development and supply of the
bodyshell for 'a new specialist vehicle for European markets'.
Rover said that it had not yet made a 'final' decision about the development
of a new MG, but it conceded that 'our studies have been extended by
investigating possible relationships which might be relevant'.
It is understood that a final decision will be taken shortly on the project,
code-named PR3, which is aimed at resurrecting the world-famous MG sports
car marque by launching a small, affordable, volume-produced roadster in
1995.
Mayflower said that it would invest up to Pounds 24.2m in the initial
engineering design, development and tooling work, including the
establishment of the necessary production facilities for the 'new specialist
vehicle'.
Production of the bodyshells was expected to start in the early part of
1995, it said, and was planned to reach a level 'in excess' of 10,000 a year
at full production with an annual sales value of around Pounds 20m. The
initial contract was expected to be for six years.
It is understood that output of the new MG is being planned to reach 15,000
to 20,000 a year.
The car is expected to be mid-engined and is likely to be powered at the top
end of the range by Rover's K-Series engine in a new 1.6-litre version,
which is currently under development.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL has exempted most Cavalier models from an average 2.9 per cent
price increase yesterday on its cars.
The move was presented as a first response to the new company car taxation
structure.
The carmaker also said it was eliminating all dealer incentives on
Cavaliers, worth Pounds 300-Pounds 400 per car, adding that the measures
were another step in cutting dealer margins.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Call for day off to beat rail strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and CHRISTIAN BOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES should work out which jobs employees could do from home on Friday
or give them the day off because of the threatened national rail strike, the
Institute of Management said yesterday .
Staying at home 'would be better than sitting in a traffic jam for three
hours, arriving at the office in a stinking mood and then having to leave
after a couple of hours', the institute said.
Not everyone could work from home, the institute said, 'but you can do a
fair amount of work or catch up on reading and correspondence'.
The one-day strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union is
over threatened compulsory British Rail redundancies and the use of outside
contractors.
In a separate dispute, many London buses will also be off the road on
Friday. Bus staff are protesting, in their third day of action, over wage
cuts and longer working hours.
The rail and the bus strikes coincide with a one-day strike by the National
Union of Mineworkers over pit closures.
The Institute of Management's advice to employers to draw up contingency
plans appeared yesterday to be largely unnecessary, and there was little
enthusiasm for the idea of a day's holiday for staff, or working from home.
The banks did not expect to have to close any branches: Midland, for
example, will provide coaches for its staff. Legal &amp; General is also laying
on coaches, and groups of employees are arranging to share cars.
Workers at local BT centres could find themselves distracted from their
duties by extra bodies - staff unable to reach their workplace are supposed
to report to their nearest office. BT admitted it was usually difficult to
find volunteers anything to do for the day.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Company fleet tax regime welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW company car taxation rules to be introduced in April next year, based on
a percentage of car list prices, were welcomed as more fair than the present
system by two thirds of companies questioned at last week's Company Car
Business Show.
Even the Budget's 8 per cent increase in road tax charges - well in excess
of inflation - was regarded as 'realistic' by 41 per cent of the
respondents, undertaken by the car leasing subsidiary of BRS, the
fleet-management group.
The main criticism of the new system was its retention of the present system
of business mileage bands under which high business mileage drivers pay
substantially less tax on their company car benefit than drivers for whom
their car is mainly a perk.
More than three quarters of the 76 companies questioned said that would
encourage drivers to continue running up unnecessary business mileage to
achieve the lower tax thresholds.
Fifty nine per cent of companies said they felt the new system would lead to
more employees opting for a cash alternative to their company cars.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Sex bias ruling extends benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN claiming severe disablement and invalid care allowances will be
entitled to receive benefits until they are 65 following a ruling by the
European Court of Justice yesterday.
The Luxembourg court ruled that the social security secretary was not
justified in denying women access to the benefits - which are linked to
state pension ages - because they are over 60.
Reliance on the discriminatory state pension ages to deny women access to
these benefits was in breach of the European directive on statutory social
security which requires that men and women be treated equally, the court
said.
The case, backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission, was brought by five
women who had been forced to give up work either through their own
ill-health or the need to care for severely disabled dependants.
They were prevented from claiming invalid care allowance and severe
disablement allowance because they were over 60 and the upper limit for
receiving those benefits is 60 for women and 65 for men, in line with state
pension ages.
The case meant that other women who would have lost benefits at 60 because
of the state pension age for women will receive such benefits for an
additional five years, the commission said. It added that 1,500 other cases
are waiting for rulings.
Mr Alan Lakin, the commission's chief legal adviser, said the case 'shows
yet again the extent of the sex discrimination and confusion which comes
from different state pension ages'.
He said the commission was looking forward to the government's white paper
on equalising state pension ages in the hope that some of these anomalies
could be sorted out.

FT  31 MAR 93 / EOC says women overlooked by Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales are abandoning
training programmes for women returning to work after bringing up their
families, an investigation by the Equal Opportunities Commission has found.
It said the setting up of the employer-led Tecs to deliver government-funded
training schemes had not made a 'jot of difference' to the take-up of
training opportunities between men and women.
A squeeze on budgets, as well as the nature of contracts between Tecs and
the government, meant that priority was being given to schemes for young
people and the long-term unemployed adults, said the commission.
It said: 'As a result, programmes and initiatives for labour market
returners were being severely curtailed - a short-term policy which could
well prove short-sighted.' Women returners were now 'a constant and vital
component of the workforce.'
The formal investigation by the commission - the results of which have been
submitted to Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary - also discovered a
lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation of schemes by Tecs.
The commission said the councils were mostly 'either unable or unwilling' to
provide figures on how many women were provided with training places. It is
recommending to Mrs Shephard that Tecs should be obliged to carry out
monitoring as part of their contracts.
Some Tecs with large ethnic minorities had initiated valuable schemes to
help women in those communities.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Office block built to be destroyed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN eight-storey office block is being built in a former airship hangar at
Cardington, Bedfordshire. When complete it will be set on fire, vibrated
until it starts to collapse and blown up in one of the world's largest
construction research projects, being carried out by the British Building
Research Establishment, Andrew Taylor writes.
The hangar is one of the world's biggest single enclosed spaces. It once
housed the R100 airship and its neighbour contained the ill-fated R101. It
could house the Statue of Liberty, Nelson's Column and the Leaning Tower of
Pisa and still have room for a couple of jumbo jets.
The building will cost Pounds 1.25m, of which the government is providing
Pounds 1m. Private companies seeking to test their products and building
techniques are providing some labour and materials.
Private institutions from other countries wanting to conduct tests will be
expected to pay rent for the space they occupy in the building while
research is carried out.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Evidence on opt-out schools uncertain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST report by the school inspectors into schools which have opted out
of local authority control in England and Wales has found no conclusive
evidence that they have raised educational standards.
Overall standards in grant-maintained schools were slightly higher than in
those which remained under local education authority control. The standards
were judged to be satisfactory or better in 3 per cent more of the lessons
in grant-maintained schools than in local-authority schools.
But if selective schools in the two sectors are compared, the
local-authority schools had slightly higher standards. Only among
non-selective schools did grant-maintained schools achieve higher standards.
The report covers 81 of the first 143 schools to opt out - mainly secondary
schools. The inspectors say they found no significant difference in the
quality of the teaching between the two sectors.
The grant-maintained schools have adapted well to their new framework, the
inspectors say. They have taken advantage of enhanced funding and greater
flexibility in budgeting to increase staffing, pay teachers extra and
improve buildings.
The report came as Mr John Patten, education secretary, predicted in the
Commons that the movement towards grant-maintained schools would be
'absolutely irreversible' by the next general election.
The proportion of secondary schools which had voted to become
grant-maintained would increase rapidly from the present level of 15 per
cent, he said. It was important that parents were given clear information
about the pros and cons of moving to grant-maintained status.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Watchdog criticises councils' tendering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHODRI DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL AUTHORITIES must review their compulsory competitive tendering
practices to make them more responsive to consumers, according to a report
published today.
The report by the Audit Commission - local government's watchdog - says some
services that are contracted out are breaking down or of a poor standard. In
a survey of 150 schools, a third expressed dissatisfaction with services
such as cleaning and catering supplied by contractors.
Poor contract conditions, lack of competition for contracts and authorities'
ignorance of consumer needs had contributed to a tendering initiative
'fraught with problems', says the report.
Since the 1988 Local Government Finance Act, Pounds 2bn of local authority
services, mostly refuse collection and school catering, have been subject to
tendering. The report says three-quarters of companies that expressed an
initial interest in contracts failed to bid. Almost 85 per cent of contracts
were awarded to councils' own direct services organisations.
In spite of an overall reduction of 7 per cent in the cost of contracted
services, the scarcity of private sector tenderers could be hindering
greater efficiency and value for money, according to the report.
Recommendations to attract private sector bids include regular meetings
between authorities and their present contractors, and more precise contract
framing. There should also be greater consultation between authorities and
schools and colleges before contracts are drafted. 'It's necessary to
consider the needs of consumers rather than the client department,' the
report says.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC and US are today expected to challenge each other about
implementation of last year's agreement to limit subsidies to civil aircraft
manufacturers.
Both sides stressed yesterday that the talks were routine consultations
rather than negotiations, and were foreseen in the deal put together last
April after more than five years of EC-US discussions. 'Everybody's made
very clear that there's no intention to reopen the agreement,' said one EC
official yesterday.
But the meeting, which should continue tomorrow, has taken on added
importance because of the recession in the aircraft industry and a series of
statements by the new US administration attacking EC government subsidies to
Airbus, the European manufacturing consortium.
Today's talks also follow Monday's highly charged encounter in Brussels
between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan,
the EC trade commissioner. Mr Kantor left Brussels yesterday, and concerns
about aircraft subsidies were among the issues touched on during his visit.
The EC-US agreement was only finalised last summer and set a limit on direct
subsidies to manufacturers, as a proportion of total aircraft development
costs, and a double-limit on indirect subsidies, as a proportion of total
civil aircraft turnover and of each individual manufacturer's turnover in
the sector.
At today's meeting senior EC officials are expected to cite new studies,
which they say indicate that indirect support for US aircraft manufacturers
may have breached the limits agreed last year. They will also take up the EC
industry's criticisms of special tax financing vehicles used by US
manufacturers such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
In return the US is ready to challenge 'walkaway' leases, which allow
carriers to return new aircraft to manufacturers in less than a year to
avoid airlines recording the deals on their strained balance sheets.
Although US manufacturers concede that such financing packages were invented
by McDonnell Douglas, they believe Airbus can use them more freely to drum
up business, because it is backed by government subsidies.
But Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, yesterday criticised US
manufacturers, especially Boeing, for attempting to influence the outcome of
the trade talks by a campaign 'of innuendo, defamatory remarks and
contradictory statements'.
Mr Pierson accused Boeing of 'deception' and said the US company's attitude
did nothing to improve current US-EC trade tensions.
Although EC officials are cautious about reading too much into recent
high-level US statements criticising last year's agreement, they will seek
clarification about the Clinton administration's intentions.
They will also try to discover Washington's attitude towards legislation
presented by US senators which would increase indirect support to the US
industry, and bring dumping and subsidy complaints against Airbus.

FT  31 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Coca still vital to Bolivian economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH Bolivia, one of Latin America's poorest countries, has made great
strides in stabilising its economy and liberalising foreign trade, it
remains heavily dependent on illegal exports of coca paste and cocaine, the
country's biggest source of foreign exchange.
In its review of Bolivia's trade policies and practices, published
yesterday, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade estimates that the
coca/cocaine economy contributed about 13-15 per cent of GDP, or about
Dollars 850m (Pounds 600m), in 1991. This has inflated the money supply and
put upward pressure on the exchange rate, impairing competitiveness in other
sectors.
Coca by-products may have accounted for 23-43 per cent of total exports
(legal and illicit) in 1990, according to the report. However, Bolivian
officials said yesterday that gross coca/cocaine exports were now only about
a quarter of the total and, with only a third of the revenue retained in
Bolivia, the effects on the exchange rate and resource allocation had
'significantly diminished'.
In practice, as the report acknowledges, the real exchange rate has steadily
depreciated since 1987.
Gatt notes that coca eradication programmes have had only limited success,
souring relations with the US. Reduced farm subsidies by the industrialised
world, particularly for oilseeds, could help encourage the substitution of
new crops by stabilising world prices.
But Gatt members found much to praise when they discussed the report
yesterday. Bolivia's inflation rate has fallen from 24,000 per cent in 1985,
when the stabilisation programme was launched, to 11 per cent last year.
Import duties of up to 70 per cent have been replaced by a uniform tariff,
currently 10 per cent, and quantitative restrictions have been scrapped.
Exports and the economy have been diversified away from minerals such as tin
and natural gas.
Real incomes, which fell sharply when the stabilisation programme was
introduced, have been growing since 1987, although they remain below 1980
levels.

FT  31 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US and Japan put off talks as scandal
widens

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN and the US have postponed a meeting, due to begin tomorrow, to review
foreign access to the Japanese construction market, as each side argued that
a gathering was futile when the other was unwilling to compromise.
The postponement comes in the midst of a broadening Japanese political
scandal, which has seen prosecutors unearth evidence to support past US
claims that bid-rigging is common and that the contract process lacks
transparency, leaving it open to unfair manipulation.
But the US says the scandal was not the cause of the disagreement between
the countries.
Both had prepared proposals for discussion at the meeting, called to examine
technical standards for contracts, but the two sides were so far apart that
there was no point in proceeding.
The meeting, scheduled to be held in Washington, was not expected to deal
with the even more sensitive issue of whether Japan will increase from 34
the number of projects for which simplified bidding procedures have been
adopted for foreign contractors.
A Japanese construction ministry official said there is a 'big gap' between
the two countries and the 'US shows no intention of wanting to narrow that
gap'.
The fresh differences suggest that the issue may be high on the agenda when
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, visits Washington next month.
Japanese officials are concerned that the political scandal, arising from an
investigation into Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former godfather of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, will encourage US officials to take a tougher
stand on market access.
Mr Miyazawa said told the Japanese parliament yesterday that 'all possible
measures' would be taken to ensure the transparency of public works bidding
procedures.
He is under pressure to introduce reforms, as prosecutors found materials
suggesting that companies awarded construction projects routinely donated a
small percentage of the revenue to the LDP.

FT  31 MAR 93 / World Trade News: AT&amp;T secures lucrative Chinese telephone
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph has reached agreement with the China
National Post and Telecommunications Industry Corporation to co-produce
telephone systems and other communications equipment for the booming China
market.
The memorandum of understanding, signed at the weekend, is a further
indication that the US communications giant is poised to make substantial
inroads into one of the world's largest telecommunications markets after
several false starts.
In February, AT&amp;T signed an umbrella agreement with China's state planning
commission to provide telecommunications equipment and training. This was
seen as a breakthrough for the US company, which had previously been
squeezed from the lucrative China switching market, partly in reprisal for
its refusal in the late 1970s to provide the Chinese with advanced switching
equipment.
AT&amp;T's re-entry to the China market was facilitated partly by fair trade
pressures brought by the US administration, and also because the Chinese are
looking for ways to ease criticism of their huge Dollars 18bn (Pounds
12.6bn) trade surplus with the US.
Mr Gary Hickox, an AT&amp;T marketing vice-president, said that AT&amp;T, in
partnership with manufacturer S. Megga and PTIC, planned to produce cordless
telephones, digital answering machines, fax machines, videophones and other
telecommunications products. AT&amp;T executives have been quoted as saying that
the China market could mean 'billions of dollars in revenue over the next
decade'.
'The size of the Chinese telecommunications market is such that a change of
one per cent in the tele-density, or the number of telephones for 100
people, is equal to about 12m lines,' Mr Randall Tobias, AT&amp;T's
vice-chairman said in February in Beijing.
AT&amp;T, which has entered joint ventures in China to produce fibre optic cable
and transmission equipment, registered sales in China last year of about
Dollars 100m.

ASEA Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, said it had
won contracts to supply two 300MW combined heat and power generating plants
in Guangdong province in southern China.
The value of the two separate contracts was put at Dollars 300m (Pounds
211m), and ABB said it had responsibility for purchasing, installation and
initial operation of the plants as well as for supplying components.
ABB said both plants would include two 100MW gas turbines, a steam turbine
and two heat recovery steam generators. The locations for the plants and
identities of the customers were not revealed.
The components would be manufacturered mainly in Switzerland and Germany.
The first shipments would be made later this year and both plants would
begin commercial operation in early 1995.
The group said earlier this month that it planned to spend Dollars 1bn over
the next five years to expand its presence in Asian markets.
Mr Goran Lundberg, ABB director for power plants, said yesterday that China
was 'one of the world's more promising markets for power generation'.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Mixed start to pollution permit sale
</HEADLINE>

THE US Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday it had taken in
Dollars 21.4m (Pounds 15m) from the landmark auction of air pollution
allowances, its market-based scheme to reduce acid rain.
However, most of the allowances offered by private companies failed to fetch
their minimum prices and were not sold. Allowances allocated to the auction
by the EPA had no minimum bid, and all found buyers. It received 171 bids.
The pollution emission permits are granted to 110 of the largest sulphur
dioxide (SO) polluters, all of them coal-burning electricity utilities, in
the first phases of the EPA's clean-air programme. Companies may trade
allowances that are surplus to their own needs.
Bids came from power companies, coal producers, environmentalists and
smokestack industries for the rights to emit 275,510 tons of SO into the air
after 1995. In the end only 150,010 tons of emission permits were sold. The
average price per tonne of SO emissions was Dollars 439 for permits up to
1999, the first phase of the two-phase programme, with the lowest successful
bid Dollars 122 and the highest Dollars 450.
Brokers bidding for industry took about 5 per cent of the total. A few
public interest groups, including environmentalists, made token purchases of
the allowance. Utilities, predictably, were the biggest buyers, with
Carolina Power and Light the largest.
The auction, finalised on Monday, was conducted by the Chicago Board of
Trade.
The fact that virtually no allowances offered by utilities were sold bodes
poorly for the CBOT's plans to sponsor a series of similar auctions starting
in June, as a precursor to its planned SO futures and options markets. All
of its allowances will be privately offered and presumably will have minimum
prices.
The prices reached at auction were substantially below the cost of
installing air-cleaning scrubbers or switching to low-sulphur fuel, and were
also below rates established in private transactions for the allowances.
Mr Richard Sandor, an architect of the CBOT's planned emissions futures
market, said price competition from the allowance programme had already
forced the costs of clean air compliance lower. The EPA said its economic
models demonstrated that the allowance programme had cut the cost of
emissions compliance in half for electricity utility rate payers.
Mr Andrew Weissman, of Clean Air Capital Markets, a Washington-based
investment banking firm, believes the auction format is inappropriate for
pricing the allowances, and fears the low prices will deliver the wrong
message to the market.
He said the sale's timing hurt prices. 'The nature of compliance planning is
you need a long lead time. The auction came too late for phase one
compliance plans, and was a little too early for companies planning for the
second phase of emission standards.'
Illinois Power, a mid-west electricity utility, recently elected to buy SO
allowances from other utilities and delay installing scrubbing technology.
It is hoping the delay will allow it to purchase more advanced technology
when scrubbers are finally installed in its smokestacks in 1999.

FT  31 MAR 93 / 'Boom' mood on Latin America recalls 1970s: Stephen Fidler
on a resurgence of confidence in the private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS, businessmen and investors in their thousands have converged on
Hamburg, Germany, this week illustrating a resurgence in private sector
confidence in Latin America not seen since the 1970s.
The annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank - a few years ago
a desultory gathering of officials and debt negotiators - is once more a
focal point for deal-makers from the world's financial capitals. 'Boom
Times]' shouted the headline in yesterday's conference newspaper.
For some, however, the feeling is too reminiscent of the pre-debt crisis
1970s to be comfortable. At issue is how secure are the widely-praised
pro-market economic reforms seen in the region in the last five years, and
what are the priorities for the years ahead?
While the experience from country to country is varied, there is no doubt
that the extent of the reform has been greater and more sustained than would
have been predicted a few years ago.
A new generation of technocrat economists, represented in Hamburg by
Mexico's finance minister Mr Pedro Aspe, Chile's Mr Alejandro Foxley and
Argentina's Mr Domingo Cavallo, have put budgets in balance, opened their
economies and moved to reform the structure of their economies.
'We have been seeing a lot of things that help efficiency,' one official
from an international financial institution said yesterday, 'but we have not
 -except for Chile - had a breakthrough in growth.'
Chile, with the region's longest-standing economic reform programmes, grew
at 10.4 per cent last year, and inflation fell to 12 per cent. But the
largest economy - Brazil - shrank by 1 per cent.
For the rest of the region, its average 4 per cent growth translates to less
than 2 per cent per capita after population expansion: modest after the
sharp falls in income during the 1980s.
Brazil's economic performance, and the path of future reform, remains an
important question, in spite of the government's espousal of orthodox
rhetoric in confronting these problems. 'Would we talk about western Europe
being in good shape if Germany was in a mess?' asked one official.
But beyond Brazil, in two countries where reform is significantly more
advanced - Mexico and Argentina - some basic economic questions are still to
be answered. The main issue is the sustainability of widening current
account deficits, presently being financed but perhaps with an excessive
reliance on short-term volatile capital inflows.
Beyond this, politicians are now addressing what Mr Angel Gurria, president
of Bancomext, Mexico's export promotion bank, calls 'second and third
derivative' economic reforms. He is talking about the privatisation of
road-building and other infrastructure projects, as well as social security
and pension reforms.
Pension fund reform is important for two related reasons: it is seen as
central in boosting domestic savings, thereby reducing the region's
dependence on unreliable foreign capital. It also furthers the development
of a domestic capital market, allowing businesses to raise funds locally.
At the same time, some Latin American governments are starting to look
seriously at questions of longer-term development - in particular improving
primary and secondary education. Education is viewed as the single most
important issue in raising the living standards of the poor and as critical
in enhancing the region's attraction to international and domestic
investors.
Furthermore, the need to attain long-term stability in government finance,
along with expanding social and educational programmes, will see the need
for fundamental reform of the region's woefully inadequate systems of
taxation. And that will require a change of mentality, most significantly
among the region's elites who have long escaped the tax net.
In the next two years most countries in the region will be electing new
administrations. Given reasonable external conditions, there is little
expectation among officials in Hamburg that this will herald a sharp
reversal in economic policies.
Until the new governments are in place, however, there will remain the
question articulated by Mr Shaheed Husain, head of the World Bank's Latin
American division: 'We still can't be sure that economic reform will survive
its founding fathers.'

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has reshuffled his cabinet for the second
time this year and replaced the embattled head of his Institutional
Revolutionary party in a move designed to bolster the party's standing
before presidential elections next year.
Mr Emilio Gamboa, a presidential aspirant, becomes minister of transport and
communications, replacing Mr Andres Caso Lombardo who has been embroiled in
controversy over the awarding of air traffic control contracts.
Mr Gamboa, who was head of the Institute of Social Security, is close to Mr
Salinas. He was also private secretary to former President Miguel de la
Madrid for six years.
Mr Genaro Borrego, president of the PRI for the past 10 months, moves on to
head the Social Security Institute. He is seen within the party as a spent
force politically.
Mr Fernando Ortiz Arena, head of the PRI in the Chamber of Deputies and a
more experienced political figure, takes over the party's leadership. He has
contacts across the political spectrum that will stand him in good stead as
the in-fighting over the presidential succession gathers pace.
The president also removed officials seen as tainted by charges of
corruption in the US, in an attempt to avoid damage to Mexico's image in the
run-up to a US congressional vote on Nafta. Among them was Mr Enrique
Alvarez del Castillo, former attorney-general and former governor of Jalisco
state, removed as head of Banobras, the state bank.

The US Environmental Protection Agency revealed yesterday it had received
150 bids in its first auction of air pollution allowances, the agency's
market-based scheme to reduce acid rain.
However, most of the allowances offered by private companies failed to fetch
their minimum prices and were not sold.
The pollution emission permits are granted to 110 of the largest sulphur
dioxide polluters, many of them coal-burning electric utilities. Companies
are allowed to trade allowances in excess of their own needs to meet
pollution standards.
Bids came from power companies, coal producers, environmentalists and
smokestack industries for the rights to emit 275,510 tonnes of sulphur
dioxide (SO) into the air after 1995.
The average price per tonne of SO emissions was Dollars 439 (Pounds 309) for
permits up to 1999, the first phase of the two-phase programme, with the
lowest successful bid Dollars 122 and the highest Dollars 450.
Brokers bidding for industry took about 5 per cent of the total. A few
public interest groups, including environmentalists, made token purchases of
five or six of the allowances. The sealed-bid auction, finalised on Monday,
was conducted by the Chicago Board of Trade.
The prices reached at auction are substantially below the cost of
technologies for reducing emissions under the Clean Air Act. This could
force a rethink in marketing strategies by companies selling smokestack
scrubbers, which reduce sulphur emissions, and those marketing high-priced
low-sulphur coal.
Scrubbing costs vary widely, although analysts say technology for meeting
emission requirements after the year 2000 ranges in price from Dollars 700
to Dollars 1,200 per tonne.
The next official auction is due in March, although private trades are
allowed to continue until then.
Some analysts suggested the Chicago auction was an inappropriate format for
the sale and that demand was also dampened by the sale's timing.
'The nature of compliance planning is you need a long lead time,' said Mr
Andrew Weissman, of Clean Air Capital Markets, a Washington-based investment
banking firm.
'The auction came too late for phase one compliance plans, and was a little
too early for companies planning for the second phase of emissions
standards.'
He fears artificially low auction prices will be misinterpreted. 'This is
not a liquid market, and lends itself most readily to customised
transactions,' he said.
A number of regulatory, market or financing factors helped to depress the
prices at auction, he added.
'Scrubbing costs and fuel switching (into less polluting energies) costs
have come down substantially.'
Illinois Power, a mid-west electricity utility that burns large amounts of
high-sulphur coal, recently elected to buy SO allowances from other
utilities and delay installing scrubbing technology. It plans to buy between
75,000 and 125,000 allowances per year through 1999 in a strategy expected
to preserve hundreds of jobs.
The utility is hoping the delay will allow it to buy more advanced
technology when scrubbers are finally installed in its smokestacks in 1999.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Altman goes on trial on BCCI charges: US lawyer pleads not
guilty
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Altman, a US lawyer, went on trial in New York yesterday in the
first criminal hearing related to the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (BCCI) affair since the bank was shut by regulators in July
1991.
Mr Altman, 46, is standing trial alone. He and Mr Clark Clifford, his law
partner and mentor, face charges of fraud and receiving Dollars 40m in
bribes. Both have pleaded not guilty.
The trial of Mr Clifford, a powerful Washington player who served as
President Lyndon Johnson's defence secretary, and adviser to four
presidents, has been delayed because of his illness. Mr Clifford's lawyers
have argued that the 86-year-old's heart condition might kill him if he is
forced to stand trial.
Mr Altman's trial is expected to last about two months.
It stems from BCCI-related charges announced last summer by Mr Robert
Morgenthau, New York's district attorney. Mr Altman was indicted for
allegedly misleading regulators about BCCI's secret control of a US bank,
First American Bankshares, of which Mr Altman was president and Mr Clifford
chairman. Mr Altman was also charged with receiving bribes from BCCI in the
form of 'sham loans and stock deals'.
Judge John Bradley, who is hearing the case in Manhattan's Supreme Court,
later threw out conspiracy charges against Mr Clifford and Mr Altman.
BCCI was shut in 1991 after audits showed rampant fraud. Some Dollars 550m
of its US assets were forfeited as part of a settlement between its
liquidators and the US authorities over fraud, racketeering and money
laundering by the bank before its collapse.
Mr Altman is facing another trial in June on federal charges of conspiring
to defraud the Federal Reserve Board.

THE Clinton administration yesterday reiterated its support for the
Enterprise for Americas initiative, the trade, debt and investment programme
launched by President George Bush in June 1990.
In a speech delivered in Hamburg yesterday on behalf of Mr Larry Summers, US
undersecretary designate for international affairs the US also underlined
support for the North American Free Trade Agreement subject to
understandings in the areas of environmental quality and workers' rights.
Washington said it hoped 'to be able to negotiate and extend the benefits of
Nafta to other nations as well.'
The speech called for greater attention to be paid to the region's social
problems and urged the InterAmerican Development Bank to expand its support
for such programmes. 'Latin leaders must address critical issues, including
the alleviation of poverty, human rights, environmental protection and
removing government impediments to innovation and growth.'
US officials said yesterday that debt relief under the Enterprise for
Americas initiative would continue to be funded in fiscal 1994, having
survived intensive budget discussions. Contrary to a report in yesterday's
FT, agreements signed in December and January with a handful of countries
had secured funding in the 1993 budget and most had already gone ahead.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has forecast a 7.6 per cent growth in
the country's GDP for this year, slightly below earlier government
projections. Presenting its annual report, Mr Jaafar Hussein, the bank's
governor, said 1992 real GDP growth had been 8 per cent, again slightly
below earlier estimates, mainly due to slower expansion of manufacturing and
mining output.
Despite the slowdown, Malaysian growth had out-performed all other Asean
countries and the newly-industrialising countries in Asia. The economy would
'consolidate to a more sustainable growth path, consistent with price
stability'.
The bank said the balance of payments had significantly improved in 1992,
with the merchandise account recording a MDollars 7.3bn (Pounds 1.9bn)
surplus, mainly due to zero import growth. But efforts must continue to
narrow the services account deficit, which at MDollars 12bn last year led to
an overall current-account deficit of MDollars 4.4bn. Other areas of concern
were inflation, at 4.7 per cent in 1992, and excess liquidity.

Algerian security forces claimed last night they had tracked down and killed
23 Moslem fundamentalists who last week raided an army barracks, killing 18
soldiers, Reuter reports from Algiers.
Another 12 fundamentalists were on the run, the gendarmerie added.
It said the raiders took weapons from the Bougzoul barracks, 100km south of
Algiers, after breaking in with help from four sympathetic soldiers.
The attackers killed eight soldiers while gaining access to the arms depot,
and then shot dead 10 more servicemen. They escaped in a waiting truck and
two vans, but were later spotted by an aircraft and intercepted.
A state of emergency was imposed in Algeria in February last year following
the election victory of the now outlawed fundamentalist Islamic Salvation
Front. More than 600 people have died in the past year, nearly half of them
members of the security forces.

The US is seeking international support for an oil embargo against Libya to

Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, writes George Graham in Washington.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, told Congress yesterday he was
frustrated with Libya's refusal to send the men for trial in the US or the
UK. 'I think the time has come to stiffen the embargo against Libya.'
Existing sanctions, imposed by the UN Security Council a year ago, are
largely limited to restrictions on the number and movements of Libyan
diplomats and a ban on international flights to and from the country.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S inner security cabinet, responding to mounting public pressure to
crack down on Arab violence against Jews, voted yesterday to seal off the
occupied territories indefinitely.
The order will confine 2m Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -
many of whom earn their livelihood in Israel - to the territories.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin convened the inner cabinet after two policemen
were shot dead in a town 30 miles north of Tel Aviv, bringing the number of
Jews killed by Arabs in the past month to 13. It is not yet clear whether
the killers were residents of the territories or Israeli Arabs.
Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, the cabinet secretary, said additional measures would
be taken to enhance security around the country, but refused to elaborate.
The recent wave of violence, which began after 415 Palestinians were
expelled from the occupied territories in mid-December, has made Mr Rabin's
government - eager to revive stalled Middle East peace talks - increasingly
agitated.
Mr Roni Milo, the former police minister and a member of the opposition
right-wing Likud party, blamed the unrest on the new government's more
dovish policies. 'The compromising attitude, the attempt to tell the Israeli
public that if we make concessions, this will bring us peace and quiet - I
believe this is the root of the problem,' he said.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia flee attacks: The Khmer
Rouge is spurring ethnic conflict, and a new tragedy in Indochina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW places are poorer than Cambodia, but the country's open spaces and
fish-filled rivers have long been irresistible attractions for the
inhabitants of overcrowded and even poorer villages in neighbouring Vietnam.
Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese have migrated to Cambodia over the
years, although the exact number is disputed. The flow of migrants increased
sharply following the Vietnamese invasion which overthrew the Khmer Rouge
regime in 1978 and rose again with the arrival of the UN peacekeeping force
after the peace accords signed by the various factions in 1991.
Vietnamese work as fishermen in the countryside and as prostitutes, artisans
or builders in the towns, making the most of their penchant for hard work
and the skills which Cambodia lost in the killings and mass emigration of
the Khmer Rouge era.
Now the Vietnamese settlers, including some who have lived in Cambodia for
generations, have started to flee, victims of a Cambodian-style 'ethnic
cleansing' campaign conducted by Khmer Rouge guerrillas and more or less
openly approved by the intensely nationalistic Cambodian people.
After a series of massacres in rural areas - including one this month in a
fishing village on the Tonle Sap lake in which at least 34 Vietnamese were
killed - guerrillas for the first time targeted Vietnamese residents of the
capital Phnom Penh in grenade attacks on Monday night; two people were
killed and 14 injured in an attack on a Vietnamese cafe only 50 metres from
UN headquarters.
Yesterday more than 3,000 ethnic Vietnamese were reported to be fleeing
Cambodia, many of them in a convoy of boats heading down the Tonle Sap
river.
The extreme left-wing Khmer Rouge leadership - while flouting the peace
agreements it signed in October 1991 by refusing to disarm its guerrillas,
co-operate with the UN or participate in elections scheduled for May - has
skilfully exploited the Vietnamese issue to revive its fading influence.
Many Cambodians are so anxious to blame their problems on foreigners rather
than on their own inadequacies that they seem prepared to overlook the Khmer
Rouge's record of killing an estimated 1m Cambodians during its reign of
terror between 1975 and 1978 - a bout of amnesia which has astonished UN
officials as much as the cruelty of the anti-Vietnamese massacres.
It is surprising, too, that Cambodians rarely emphasise the fact that the
Khmer Rouge is beholden to Thailand (another traditional enemy of Cambodia),
just as the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian administration was once dependent
on Hanoi.
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge attacks on the Vietnamese, both physical and verbal,
have become so popular that other Cambodian factions have enthusiastically
adopted anti-Vietnamese rhetoric in their election campaigns and generally
refused to criticise the Khmer Rouge on the issue; before France came to the
rescue as a colonial power, most Cambodian territory was controlled either
by Vietnam or Thailand, and the fertile rice-growing area of Vietnam's
Mekong delta is still regarded by Cambodians as part of their ancestral
land.
The elections may not take place on schedule anyway. Even before the killing
of the fishermen and the latest attacks in Phnom Penh, Mr Yasushi Akashi,
the head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, had said conditions
were not yet suitable for an election.
With the security situation deteriorating daily, it is hard to see how he
can suddenly turn around and declare that conditions are right for a free
and fair election.
For Vietnam - aside from the difficulty of absorbing as many as 500,000
returning settlers from Cambodia - the principal danger of the chaos in
Cambodia is that the Khmer Rouge will again seize power and again provoke
Vietnam as it did in the 1970s by shelling and attacking villages inside
Vietnamese territory; when the border violations became intolerable the
Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia and rapidly seized Phnom Penh.
The Vietnamese are unlikely to invade again. Their army is smaller and
weaker and they are more concerned with liberalising their economy and
catching up with their dynamic south-east Asian rivals. The killing of
Vietnamese in Cambodia, however, is an unwelcome setback for what many had
hoped would be a period of peaceful development for Indochina.

FT  31 MAR 93 / UK backs Iraqi opposition grouping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday threw its weight behind the Iraqi National Congress (INC),
an umbrella body grouping a wide range of President Saddam Hussein's
opponents. Three leaders of the Congress, representing the Kurdish, Sunni
Arab and Shia Arab communities, called on the prime minister, Mr John Major,
at Downing Street, and had talks with the foreign secretary, Mr Douglas
Hurd.
Although Mr Hurd was cautious about promising any material British aid to
the group, he encouraged them to address themselves to 'interested parties
in the region', meaning principally Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and offered
British help in establishing such contacts.
The meeting was intended as a signal to Britain's friends in the region that
it regards the INC as the opposition grouping most worthy of support, both
because of its broad base and because of its commitment to democracy and
human rights. Among its affiliated groups are all the main Kurdish parties
and the Islamic opposition based in Iran.
Mr Saad Jabr, leader of a smaller group which claims Saudi support, also met
foreign office officials yesterday, and was urged to work with the INC.
The INC leaders told Mr Hurd they hoped to issue a statement reaffirming
their respect for Kuwait's sovereignty and borders within the next few days.
They also said the INC hoped soon to found a military wing, which could
attract members of the Iraqi armed forces wishing to defect.
Iraq would have to comply in full with United Nations resolutions, whoever
was in power in Baghdad, Mr Hurd said. He made it clear that British policy
towards Iraq remains unchanged - thus denying reports that Britain was no
longer demanding that Mr Saddam relinquish power before international
sanctions would be lifted.
The UN sanctions committee agreed on Monday at its periodic review to
maintain the sanctions against Iraq, imposed in August 1990 when Iraq
invaded Kuwait.

South Korea's ruling party said yesterday it would ask six of its MPs,
including the present and former speakers of the National Assembly, to
resign for alleged corruption, writes John Burton in Seoul. The action
follows asset disclosures made by the MPs of the Democratic Liberal Party
under the order of President Kim Young-sam. Some have been criticised for
possessing 'excessive' wealth and are suspected of tax evasion.
Mr Park Jyun-kyu, the speaker, resigned from the party on Monday in protest
at its attempt to force him from parliament. But his predecessor, Mr Kim
Jai-son, agreed to leave. Another five MPs have been reprimanded and are
unlikely to be renominated for 1996 parliamentary elections.

India yesterday asked the World Bank to cancel funding for the half-built
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) scheme to dam the Narmada river in north-west
India, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. India said it would continue
building the dams from its own resources. The World Bank has lent Dollars
280m of the Dollars 450m it pledged to the project and will now retain the
remaining Dollars 170m.
The bank is dropping the scheme after mounting criticism about the project's
environmental impact. An independent review of the scheme found many
criticisms justified and prompted the bank last October to set tough new
conditions for its continued support.
India has judged it cannot meet the bank's terms, which included a deadline
set for today for preparing detailed proposals on improving the conditions
under which displaced villagers are resettled, and for an environmental
master-plan.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Malaysia expects 7.6% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has forecast a 7.6 per cent growth in
the country's GDP for this year, slightly below earlier government
projections.
Presenting its annual report, Mr Jaafar Hussein, the bank's governor, said
1992 real GDP growth had been 8 per cent, again slightly below earlier
estimates, amainly due to slower expansion of manufacturing and mining
output.
Despite the slowdown, Malaysian growth had outperformed all other Asean
countries and the newly-industrialising countries in Asia. This slight
easing was a blessing in disguise, letting the economy 'consolidate to a
more sustainable growth path, consistent with price stability'.
The bank said the balance of payments position had significantly improved in
1992, with the merchandise account recording a MDollars 7.3bn (Pounds 1.9bn)
surplus against a MDollars 461m deficit in 1991, an improvement mainly due
to zero import growth. But efforts must continue to narrow the services
account deficit, which at MDollars 12bn last year, led to an overall
current-account deficit of MDollars 4.4bn.
Other areas of concern were inflation, up from 4.1 per cent in 1991 to 4.7
per cent in 1992, and continuing excess liquidity. Manufactured goods
exports, now accounting for about 70 per cent of total exports, would grow
16.5 per cent this year, against 17 per cent in 1992.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Share fraud hits Jakarta market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FRAUD involving forged certificates has led to the suspension of dealings
in the shares of five of Indonesia's top companies.
The transactions involving forged certificates occurred between March 15 and
March 19, leading the Jakarta stock exchange to suspend until April 1 trade
in Indah Kiat and Indorayon, two of the region's leading wood-pulp
companies, Inco, a nickel producer, H M Sampoerna, a cigarette company, and
Semen Gresik, a cement producer.
When the suspension is lifted, brokers must obtain stock exchange clearance
of the companies' share certificates as part of any transaction. Brokers
doubt, however, the exchange's ability to verify certificates within the
four days in which trade must legally be completed.
Mashill Securities, a local brokerage company, alerted the stock exchange 10
days ago to the fraud but, with the market on holiday last week, trade in
the affected companies was not suspended until Monday.
At least five foreign broking houses have been left holding fake
certificates and face possible losses, brokers say.
The two people implicated in the crime have fled the country, reportedly to
Hong Kong, and Interpol has been alerted. While the fraud's size, estimated
at Rp12bn (Pounds 3.8m), is not substantial, its details have alarmed
brokers who fear more scandals may unfold.
The suspects had been dealing in the market for a year, making single trades
of up to Rp1bn prior to the 'sting', say brokers who fear forged shares in
other companies may await discovery.
The forged certificates are also of exceptional quality, passing tests
required by brokers such as ultra-violet checking of watermarks and carrying
brokers' stamps recording former transactions.
Details on the forgeries have also led brokers to speculate the criminals
may have had access to confidential company share registers.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Tokyo stocks go mad for March: But has the market really
turned around, asks Emiko Terazono
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE stock market has turned around,' proclaimed a full-page advertisement
yesterday from Daiwa Securities, the leading Japanese broker, which offered
seminars to instruct punters on the rejuvenated Tokyo market.
As the Japanese financial year draws to a close today, Japanese brokers have
had their confidence revived by an unexpected share price surge. The Nikkei
index has gained 12.3 per cent in the month on a rally triggered by active
government intervention; yesterday it closed at 18,963.16.
But suspicions are there that the surge could be Tokyo's annual bout of
'March madness'. Volumes and prices tend to rise as the fiscal year ends, as
companies try to maximise gains on stocks held or, this year, minimise
losses.
The economic background remains gloomy. Retail sales are still weak, with
February's chain-store sales down for the sixth month running. The Long Term
Credit Bank forecasts capital spending will fall 4 per cent next fiscal
year, the biggest drop since 1971; the labour market shrank 0.4 per cent
last month, the first time since December 1985.
An increasing number of economists, emboldened by the recent stock market
rise and some positive economic figures are now trying to paint a rosier
picture. 'The economy has stopped its decline,' says Mr Hirohiko Okumura,
Nomura Research Institute's chief economist.
February money supply growth turned positive for the first time in six
months, and two consecutive months' decline in the manufacturing
inventory-shipments ratio foreshadows a rise in industrial output. Some
analysts say a 1.1 per cent car sales rise last month may point to a
consumer demand turnaround.
Media reports have helped fuel such optimism. 'The economy shows signs of
bottoming out,' said the widely-read Nihon Keizai Shimbun this week. Such
articles were followed by stories entitled 'Spring has come for stock
market' and 'Consumers tired of being thrifty'.
But stock markets gains seem to be driven more by a rise in liquidity due to
lower interest rates. The rise will aid profits and companies which hold
loss-making stock investments. Kajima, the construction company, yesterday
said a rise of the Nikkei average over 19,000 would post a Y2.5bn (Pounds
14.7m) profit on its share portfolio instead of a previously projected Y5bn
loss on earlier share price estimates.
Japanese share promoters claim investors discount an economic recovery in
the new fiscal year. Overseas investors, including Europeans, and US pension
funds, are also active buyers. Some brokers say investors seem to be buying
merely in fear of missing the rally, rather than believing in an economic
recovery. Investors feel assured of a bottom around 16,000, by underlying
government support.
Considering the stock market level relative to corporate earnings, share
prices seem dear, with trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 66 times.
Most analysts expect companies' profits to fall for the new business year
starting tomorrow, although a recovery may start during the second half.
Mr Okumura says the recovery of the economy will depend on the fiscal
support package expected to be formulated before Premier Kiichi Miyazawa
heads for the US next month. A successful support package may boost the
economy 2.5 per cent, but 'if the fiscal support flops, Japan may face zero
economic growth'.
However, growing hopes over the size of the economic fiscal package are
increasing pressure on the finance ministry which is putting together the
support measures. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has said this will be
far larger than the Y10,700bn package announced last August, and figures of
up to Y20,000bn are suggested. However, finance ministry officials warn that
the package could be smaller.

FT  31 MAR 93 / China wants 'rigged' poll says Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday suggested that China wanted
'rigged' elections in the colony in 1995.
On the eve of a visit to the UK, where Britain's policy towards Hong Kong
and China is expected to come under scrutiny, Mr Patten told Singapore
radio: 'I do not want rigged arrangements for the 1995 elections.'
Mr Patten and his advisers believe that China's aim in negotiations with
Britain about the elections - if the negotiations take place - would be to
achieve an agreement which would deny a place to Hong Kong's pro-democracy
politicians.
Failing that, advisers say, China's strategy in talks will be designed to
frustrate for as long as possible the introduction of the governor's
democracy legislation into the Legislative Council, LegCo.
Since last October, Mr Patten has made a point of saying that the colony's
elections had to be fair, open and acceptable to Hong Kong. He has sought to
broaden the franchise beyond the small group of professionals that may have
been acceptable to China. Beijing has has waged an unremitting campaign
against him since.
'China wants us to do their dirty work for them,' said one official
yesterday. 'Well it is just not going to happen.'
Mr Patten leaves Hong Kong today for Brussels where he is expected to press
the European Commission on trade issues, including the commission's
anti-dumping policies.
But the main business to be transacted will be in London, when Mr Patten has
talks with Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary about Britain's Hong Kong policy.
In his interview with the radio station the governor said that 'big
political jobs' always threw up long agendas and difficult choices. But 'you
have to do what you think is right and you have to do what you believe is in
the interest of the people for whom you're responsible,' he said.
Yesterday Mr Patten's executive council, or quasi-cabinet, deferred until
after Easter a decision on the introduction of his legislation into LegCo.
This was to allow time for China to reconsider its position on talks with
Britain about Hong Kong's political development.
In the absence of an agreement on negotiations the Hong Kong government is
expected to table the legislation on April 21. China has threatened trade
retaliation against Britain and to bring forward administrative preparations
for the takeover of Hong Kong if Mr Patten proceeds.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Japan's jobless rate steady at 2.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S official unemployment rate in February remained steady at 2.3 per
cent, but the total number of people employed fell 0.4 per cent
year-on-year, the first drop in seven years.
Job market pressure is greater on women workers, as the number of women
working during the month fell 1.6 per cent or 410,000 year-on-year, though
few of these appear as officially unemployed. The number of men employed
rose 0.5 per cent to 36.89m.
The fall in women workers reflects the emphasis of cost-cutting companies on
reducing the number of so-called part-time workers, many of whom are women
working full-time, but outside the mainstream career path.
Another sign of the weakening demand for new employees was a fall from 0.93
to 0.91 in the ratio of job offers to applications, meaning there were fewer
jobs than applicants for the fifth consecutive month.
Announcing 'restructuring' programmes, most Japanese companies have tried to
hold onto career track personnel, trimming those workers not considered part
of the lifetime employment agreement. Generally, that means women and
seasonal workers.
Labour ministry officials are concerned that a new phase of restructuring
may begin in coming months, as companies are forced to cut costs further by
laying off a growing number of mainstream workers. If this trend does
emerge, the official unemployment figure may rise quickly. Mainstream male
workers tend to be a family's largest source of income and would need to
register quickly with the government.
The ministry said manufacturing job offers fell 26.5 per cent year-on-year,
with sharp falls in transport and communications, down 20.5 per cent, and
wholesale, retail and restaurant employment (down 18.2 per cent).
The Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), recently set up by the
banking industry to soak up non-performing loans, is likely to announce its
first round of loan credit purchases and property valuations today.
Banks hope the CCPC assessment of property collateral will set a floor
beneath still-weak prices, while the purchase of banks' non-performing loans
will enable them to write off losses for the fiscal year, which ends today.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN insisted yesterday that Iraq would have to comply in full with
United Nations resolutions, whoever was in power in Baghdad, our Foreign
Staff writes.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, made clear the policy towards Iraq
remained unchanged.
His comments followed reports that Britain was divorcing itself from past
policies which insisted that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had to be out of
power before international sanctions were lifted.
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'The government's policy towards Iraq is
unchanged and will remain the same, whatever regime is in power in Baghdad.
'Iraq must fully comply with all its international obligations. This means
full implementation of all relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions.'
Mr Hurd had made this clear in a meeting with leaders of the Iraqi national
congress, who are in London on a private visit.
But the spokeswoman acknowledged that President Saddam was unlikely to
comply with all the relevant resolutions and had evaded his obligations for
the past two years.
She said Britain's UN ambassador, Sir David Hannay, had stressed there were
no grounds for lifting sanctions against Iraq while many requirements were
still outstanding.
The UN sanctions committee agreed on Monday night at its periodic review to
maintain the sanctions against Iraq which were imposed in August 1990 when
Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait.
The UN still wants Iraq to comply with demands over respecting the border
with Kuwait, co-operating with the special commission on its weapons of mass
destruction, returning Kuwait's military property. It also wants an end to
repression of the civilian population.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THEORY President Francois Mitterrand is free to object to any of the
suggested candidates for the French cabinet, in practice he needs a very
sound reason to do so, writes Alice Rawsthorn. He must have wished he could
have found such a reason to stop Mr Alain Juppe from becoming foreign
minister.
Mr Juppe, 47, is, after all, a close friend and political confidant of the
president's old adversary, Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and leader of
the RPR. The new foreign minister was also one of the loudest voices calling
last week for the septuagenarian Socialist president to resign.
The president managed to quell the resignation calls by threatening not to
appoint a prime minister from any party - namely the RPR - which was calling
for his own dismissal. But the choice of Mr Juppe as foreign minister must
have irked him almost as much as having to accept Mr Francois Leotard at
defence, a post the president refused to give him in the last cohabitation
government.
Mr Mitterrand may yet get his revenge. The ambitious Mr Juppe, a graduate of
the elite Ecole National de l'Administration, has been overshadowed by Mr
Chirac ever since he joined the latter's private office in 1976. He was
lumbered with the low-profile job of budget minister in the last
cohabitation government and sees the Foreign Ministry as way to make his
mark on the political scene.
But foreign affairs is one of the key areas of policy that Mr Mitterrand is
determined to cling on to as head of state. The previous cohabitation
administration was marked by humiliating scenes as Mr Mitterrand upstaged Mr
Chirac, then premier, and his conservative ministers on the international
summit circuit.
Mr Mitterrand has already made it quite clear that he has no intention of
behaving any differently in the second round of cohabitation. Mr Juppe now
faces the tricky task of trying to wrest control of foreign policy from the
president, at the same time as he attempts to fulfil his own aims of
renegotiating the Gatt reforms and cementing the relationship between France
and Germany.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Joint approach urged in policy

<TEXT>
FRANCE should set up a national security council in which its Socialist
president and its new conservative government could jointly run the
country's foreign and defence policy, an influential Gaullist adviser
suggested yesterday.
Mr Pierre Lelouche, foreign affairs adviser to Mr Jacques Chirac and now an
RPR deputy, wrote in Liberation newspaper yesterday that joint
decision-making in such a council could avoid possible paralysis of French
policy on issues such as defence, the European Community and the Gatt trade
talks, where President Mitterrand and the right had differences of view.
Mr Mitterrand has made it clear he will exercise the influence allowed him
by the constitution in foreign and defence policy. However cohabitation -
the term used to describe periods in which France is governed by a president
and prime minister of opposing parties - has got off to a smooth start. Mr
Mitterrand last night approved the cabinet nominees of the new premier, Mr
Edouard Balladur of the RPR, in record time.
Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, who was Mr Mitterrand's chief of staff at the Elysee
in the last cohabitation government of 1986-88, yesterday warned the new
government against the temptation to 'hide things' from the president.
A new computer network linking the Elysee to the Quai d'Orsay's diplomatic
cable traffic would make concealment harder now.
Interest rates in the French franc money market fell sharply yesterday amid
growing speculation that the Bank of France may cut the country's official
interest rates this week, writes James Blitz.
One-month French franc interest rates fell more than a full percentage point
from 11.20 per cent to 10.18 per cent. Three-month interest rates fell from
11.00 per cent to below 10 per cent.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Christian Democrat party has been plunged into an identity crisis
following the resignation on Monday of Mr Mario Segni, leader of the
Referendum Movement.
The party, Italy's largest, has always accommodated a wide spread of
ideologies. Thus it has been both conservative and progressive, deeply
Catholic and left-leaning, market-oriented and heavily in favour of a strong
state sector in the economy. Mr Segni's gesture has profoundly damaged this
diffuse, accommodating personality and opened up an unprecedented rift in
the Catholic vote.
The circumstances in which he has left permit no room for doubt: there is no
space for him in a party so profoundly tarnished by the corruption scandals
and the even more damaging imputation from magistrates that its most senior
members are allegedly linked to the Mafia.
His Christian Democrat credentials are impeccable. Mr Segni, aged 53, is the
son of a former Christian Democrat president of the republic and has been
with the party for 16 years, representing his native Sardinia. He formed the
Referendum Movement three years ago both as a challenge to the inability of
parliament to reform the electoral process and to the control of his party
by discredited politicians.
Mr Segni has spent the best part of a year agonising over whether to remain
inside the party. It seemed after this length of time that he accepted he
could carry more weight acting as a reformist inside the party - no matter
how much he disagreed with Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the astute new Christian
Democrat leader.
Mr Martinazzoli has consistently out-manoeuvred him; perhaps the final straw
was the way in which the Christian Democrats have climbed aboard the
referendum bandwagon. This threatened to deny him a much deserved
achievement as his referendum proposals for introduction of a majority
voting system for the Senate are likely to be endorsed on April 18.
His break leaves him free in a fast-changing political climate to forge new
alliances or form his own party.
This is the first time since the war that the Catholic vote has been faced
with a split. The Church, powerful backers of the Christian Democrats, faces
an awkward choice: back the new reformist forces or stay with the
discredited Christian Democrats in the belief that Mr Segni will burn
himself out and that the former can regenerate themselves.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Enthusiast for Emu gets finance job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proponents of European monetary union can breathe a little more easily
in the knowledge that the French Finance Ministry is now in the hands of Mr
Edmond Alphandery, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Mr Alphandery, 49, who pursued an academic career as professor of economics
before opting for politics as a UDF parliamentarian, is not only a staunch
supporter of monetary union, but also of the franc fort policy of protecting
the French currency.
His academic background and international experience - he taught economics
at universities in the US as well as in France - made him an obvious choice
for Finance. Mr Alphandery certainly thought so. He is believed to have
spurned President Francois Mitterrand's offer last December of one of
France's two European commissionerships in the hope he would get the job.
The cynics in French politics were not quite so confident. They suspected
that Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, might prefer a more
malleable candidate. Mr Balladur was finance minister in the last
cohabitation government from 1986 to 1988 and might well have wanted to
carry on controling his old portfolio from the premier's offices in the
Hotel de Matignon, just like his predecessor, Mr Pierre Beregovoy.
But Mr Balladur, aware that he could come under pressure to devalue the
franc from RPR chauvinists, such as Mr Charles Pasqua and Mr Philippe
Seguin, may well have calculated that his interests would be better served
with a forceful figure at Finance.
The RPR chauvinists are the least of Mr Alphandery's problems. The new
government needs to cut interest rates as quickly and as deeply as it can,
to revive the economy and curb unemployment which has broken through the 3m
mark.
If the Bundesbank makes substantial cuts in German rates, all will go well
and French rates can follow. But if German rates remain high, Mr Alphandery
will face the grim prospect of speculative assaults on the franc from
abroad, calls for devaluation from home and a big question mark over his
hopes for European monetary union.

FT  31 MAR 93 / France wants G7 review of Gatt: New government seeks to cool
rising passions in international trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S new government would like a high-level review of the Gatt
negotiations to underline western Europe's difficulties in liberalising
trade with the rest of the world, given the EC's recent commitments to open
up commercially to east Europe, an adviser to Mr Edouard Balladur, the new
prime minister, said yesterday.
The incoming conservatives see trade negotiations becoming increasingly
bad-tempered on both sides of the Atlantic. The answer they believe is to
use the July summit of the Group of Seven industrialised countries to
elevate trade discussion above the level of the European Commission and the
US trade office.
'We need a pause for reflection,' said the adviser to Mr Balladur whose
neo-Gaullist wing of the new conservative coalition has strongly denounced
at least the agricultural aspects of the Gatt negotiations. 'But we think
the US administration wants time to reflect, because it has the same problem
we now have of passing from campaign rhetoric to the reality of government.'
France still wants a positive outcome to more than six years of Gatt
negotiations, and the recent switch of the French employers' federation to a
more publicly pro-Gatt stance will have some impact on the incoming
conservative rulers, the adviser said.
But the G7 summit could 'relaunch Gatt' in a better climate by persuading
the US of the greater burden which the EC is now shouldering in opening its
single market progressively to eastern Europe and Russia. 'When the Uruguay
Round started in 1986, the Berlin wall was still in existence, and all that
was being mainly asked of (western) Europe was to open up to developing
countries,' the adviser noted.
Another change since 1986 is the drop in the dollar's value. France
continues to want the issue of monetary stability to figure in the world
trade talks, and questions why the US considers currency parities a
legitimate cause for concern in its bilateral trade with Japan, but not with
the EC.

<TEXT>
MR Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, yesterday succeeded in
finding a solution to the budget crisis which was threatening to topple his
year-old coalition government.
King Baudouin announced he had refused the resignation of the centre-left
government submitted last week, after Mr Dehaene forged a deal to raise
BFr110bn (Pounds 2.27bn) and bring Belgium's budget deficit in line with the
Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary union.
Mr Dehaene took less than 36 hours to fulfil the mission given to him by the
king on Monday to 'mediate' between presidents of the government parties -
Flemish- and French-speaking socialists and Christian Democrats.
It is understood all four parties had agreed to scrap plans to tamper with
indexation of Belgian wages. That proposal alienated the union-backed
French-speaking socialists and precipitated last week's resignation.
Belgium's budget deficit last year reached 6.9 per cent of GNP, and drastic
measures are needed to cut it to a 4.7 per cent target by the end of next
year.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Yeltsin 'to press on with own poll'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE closest advisers of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said
yesterday that he would press ahead with his own poll - to run parallel with
a referendum conducted under the control of the Congress of People's
Deputies. This decision, and the intention of both sides to further their
own understanding of their constitutional rights, means that the Russian
power struggle continues unabated.
Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, told the daily Izvestiya
that 'the decisions of the ninth Congress will not stop Mr Yeltsin from
carrying out his own simple and very democratic plan - to put to a popular
vote the question of trust in the president. At the same time the draft for
a new constitution will also be put to popular conformation.'
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and Mr Yeltsin's chief tactician
during the Congress session, said that there would be a 'battle of the
referendums' as the Congress outcome had left Mr Yeltsin 'probably only one
choice: to hold a parallel poll to the referendum'.
Mr Shakhrai said that the Congress, which ended four tumultuous days on
Monday, had been a 'tragi-comic act'. He said that a list of allegations
that Congress had breached the constitution were now in front of the
president and, when signed, would be sent to the Constitutional Court. The
parliament, said Mr Shakhrai, was now 'outside of a legal state' and thus Mr
Yeltsin had no obligation to obey any of its directives or decrees. However,
he said that the president's side would as far as possible follow the
constitutional order, and would not press ahead immediately with legislation
under the decree establishing a special presidential regime.
'We will wait for some time,' said the deputy premier, 'but this cannot be
long, perhaps a day or two.'
However, Mr Yeltsin himself seemed less certain, according to reports of
comments made by the deputies who met him yesterday to discuss the results
of the special Congress.
Many of the deputies urged him not to hold his own poll - and one, asking
not to be named, said that 'Yeltsin acknowledged that the decision to hold a
parallel vote was ill-considered'.
Mr Yeltsin, who proposed the idea of a referendum on trust in himself and on
approval of a new constitution, saw Congress take the idea and rewrite the
questions - striking out one on the constitution and adding questions on
elections of the president and deputies at an unspecificed date, and on
approval of the economic reforms.
A poll conducted after the Congress session by the Russian Institute for
Public Opinion showed that Mr Yeltsin retains the trust of 50 per cent of
the population.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Magistrates' corruption probe forces finance minister to
quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Franco Reviglio, the Italian finance minister, resigned last night after
becoming the fifth minister in the Amato government to be caught up in the
expanding series of corruption investigations by magistrates, writes Robert
Graham.
Mr Reviglio, an economist and former chairman of Eni, the state oil concern,
sent a letter of resignation to Mr Amato after being served notice yesterday
by Milan magistrates that he was under investigation for alleged illicit
receipt of funds. The notice was served after he had voluntarily presented
himself for questioning.
Mr Reviglio's name has been frequently raised in recent weeks as
investigations deepened into Eni but he has repeatedly denied wrong-doing.
The notice is understood to concern his time as chairman at Eni from 1983 to
1989 when he was replaced by Mr Guiseppe Cagliari, who is in jail on charges
of alleged corruption and falsifying accounts. Mr Reviglio claimed to have
returned Eni to profitability.
Although considered a technocrat, Mr Reviglio, aged 58, was elected as a
Socialist senator in 1992. He joined the Amato government as budget minister
but was moved last month to finance, a portfolio he had held from 1979-81.

<TEXT>
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister and special envoy to the
peace talks, arrived in Belgrade yesterday in order to add his voice to
international pressure on Serb leaders to endorse the UN peace plan for
Bosnia, writes Laura Silber.
He was due to meet Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic to press for
Serbia's support for the proposal, drawn up by international mediators Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, to divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces.
Western diplomats believed Mr Churkin would threaten withdrawal of support
by Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia. Moslem and Croat leaders from
Bosnia have already endorsed the plan.
Mr Churkin's visit coincides with public support in Serbia for the Russian
nationalist opponents of President Boris Yeltsin's administration. Said one
western diplomat: 'He will urge Serbia to make a constructive suggestion if
they expect anything from Russia at the UN.'
The Russian minister will go on today to Pale, the Serb mountain fiefdom,
for talks with the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and then to
nearby Sarajevo to meet President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia.
Mr Aleksa Buha, the foreign minister of the self-styled Serb state in
Bosnia, said the parliament might accept the Vance-Owen plan but seek
additional amendments.

ITALY'S Christian Democrat party has been plunged into an identity crisis

achievement as his referendum proposals for introduction of a majority

His break leaves him free in a fast-changing political climate to forge new
alliances or form his own party. Already he has the support of Mr Gianni
Rivera, the former international football player and Christian Democrat
deputy, plus that of another party deputy, Mr Alberto Michelini. The latter
is identified with the conservative Catholic movement, Opus Dei, much in
favour with the papacy.
This is the first time since the war that the Catholic vote has been faced
with a split. The Church, powerful and important backers of the Christian
Democrats, now faces an awkward choice: back the new reformist forces or
stay with the discredited Christian Democrats in the belief that Mr Segni
will burn himself out and that the former can regenerate themselves.
The Christian Democrats obtained 29 per cent of the vote in last April's
general elections. Poll analysts estimated their share of the vote earlier
this month had fallen to 23-25 per cent, leaving them still the largest
party by almost 10 per cent. With the Christian Democrats under siege in
their traditional strongholds in Rome and further south, the Segni split
could deprive them of this status.

<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS relief lorries carrying food and other aid were yesterday
heading once more for Srebrenica, the most vulnerable Moslem enclave in
eastern Bosnia. But western diplomats feared the stepped-up relief effort
would not stem the panic in the town, which has been surrounded and
bombarded for almost a year by Serb forces.
Relief workers described mounting chaos in Srebrenica whose peace-time
population of 10,000 has been swelled enormously by fleeing Moslems. Most
people are hungry and poorly clothed, they say. No medicines remain.
The UN 16-lorry convoy is hoping to be able to evacuate more sick and
wounded women, children and elderly, in addition to the more than 2,000
brought out by road on Monday to Tuzla, the biggest Bosnian government
stronghold 70 miles to the north-west. Eight Moslem women and children
reportedly died on that journey when, desperate to leave the town, they
crowded on to the UN lorries.
Bosnian Serb forces appear intent on seizing Srebrenica, set in the middle
of the north-south corridor from Belgrade to Pale, the Serb mountain
stronghold above Sarajevo. A 48-hour ceasefire yesterday appeared to be
mostly holding except for some violations around Bosnia.
According to Ms Lyndall Sachs of the Belgrade office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR): 'Social structures (in Srebrenica) have
entirely collapsed. But they must be re-established in order to cope with
the situation. The population is totally demoralised. We have to instill
them with confidence through regular convoys and maintainance of the
situation.'
UN officials yesterday postponed the resumption of an evacuation by
helicopter of wounded Moslems from Srebrenica.
Diplomats said the airborne mission would restart when the UN convoy of 16
lorries left the besieged town. The air mission last week was suspended
after Serb forces attacked the makeshift air strip at Srebrenica, killing at
least three people.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister and special envoy to the
peace talks, arrived in Belgrade yesterday to add his voice to pressure on
Serb leaders to endorse the UN peace plan.

THE UN Security Council yesterday approved unanimously a three-month
extension of the mandate of the international force in former Yugoslavia,
writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and EC mediators, will again try to
resolve problems in Croatia, where the bulk of the 22,000-strong force is
deployed, which stem from a Croatian offensive in late January against Serb
districts.

THE closest advisers of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said
yesterday that he would press ahead with his own poll - to run parallel with
a referendum conducted under the control of the Congress of People's
Deputies. This decision, and the intention of both sides to further their
own understanding of their constitutional rights, means that the Russian
power struggle continues unabated.
Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, told the daily Izvestiya
that 'the decisions of the ninth Congress will not stop Mr Yeltsin from
carrying out his own simple and very democratic plan - to put to a popular
vote the question of trust in the president.
'At the same time the draft for a new constitution will also be put to
popular confirmation,' he said.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and Mr Yeltsin's chief tactician
during the Congress session, said that there would be a 'battle of the
referendums' as the Congress outcome had left Mr Yeltsin 'probably only one
choice: to hold a parallel poll to the referendum'. However, Mr Yeltsin
himself seemed less certain, according to reports of comments made by the
deputies who met him yesterday. Many of the deputies urged him not to hold
his own poll.
Mr Shakhrai said that the Congress, which ended four tumultuous days on
Monday, had been a 'tragi-comic act'.

FT  31 MAR 93 / French right in proposal to help 'cohabitation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE should set up a national security council in which its Socialist
president and its new conservative government could jointly run the
country's foreign and defence policy, an influential Gaullist adviser
suggested yesterday.
Mr Pierre Lelouche, foreign affairs adviser to Mr Jacques Chirac and now an
RPR deputy, wrote in the Liberation newspaper yesterday that joint
decision-making in such a council could avoid possible paralysis of French
policy on issues such as defence, the European Community and the Gatt trade
talks, where President Mitterrand and the right had genuine differences of
view.
The new era of cohabitation - the term used to describe periods in which
France is governed by a president and prime minister of opposing parties -
got off to a smooth start. Mr Mitterrand rapidly named Mr Edouard Balladur
of the RPR as the new prime minister within a day of the centre-right's
sweeping parliamentary victory on Sunday, and promised to 'respect
scrupulously' the new majority's general policy.
But there is still the possibility of early conflict over the composition of
Mr Balladur's cabinet, announced last night. Mr Mitterrand may yet baulk at
Mr Balladur's nominations for foreign and defence minister, areas of policy
in which the president made clear on Monday night he would exercise the
influence which the constitution gives him.
Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, who was Mr Mitterrand's chief of staff at the Elysee
in the last cohabitation government of 1986-88, yesterday warned the new
government against the temptation to 'hide things' from the president.
A new computer network linking the Elysee to the Quai d'Orsay's diplomatic
cable traffic would make concealment harder now.
Meanwhile, the manoeuvring between the RPR and UDF components of the new
ruling coalition intensified yesterday over not only ministerial posts but
also that of president of the National Assembly. In return for early
endorsement of Mr Balladur as prime minister, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
the UDF leader, said his party should get the top parliamentary post,
perhaps - some suspect - for himself because, like Mr Chirac, he is staying
out of the government.

FT  31 MAR 93 / E Germany braced for pay strikes: IG Metall calls first
officially organised stoppages in the east since 1930s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's giant engineering union, will tomorrow begin a wave of
warning strikes throughout eastern Germany in protest against a wage
agreement broken by the employers earlier this month.
The strikes, the first officially organised workers' protests since the
1930s, will take place among the region's 300,000 electrical and metal
employees.
The union is demanding a 26 per cent pay increase as part of an agreement
signed in March 1991 with Gesamtmetall, the electrical and metal employers'
association. It intends to ballot its members for an all-out indefinite
strike if the employers do not offer higher wage increases.
At the same time, IG Metall said it would instruct its members to hold
warning strikes in eastern Germany's steel sector if the steel employers did
not offer a 20 per cent wage increase, as part of a similar pay settlement
in 1991.
Yesterday, the Arbeitgeber-verband steel employers' association was still
locked in bitter disagreement over what increase to pay its workers. Along
with Gesamtmetall, it has already offered an increase of 9 per cent. But
unlike Gesamtmetall, it has so far not pulled out of the wage agreement.
This is because the Arbeitgeberverband board is divided between western and
eastern German managers.
A fifth of the 15-member board are eastern German. They are demanding that
the employers offer the steel sector in the five new eastern German states a
pay increase of 20 per cent. Gesamtmetall was supposed to have offered the
metal and electrical sector a 26 per cent increase, until it reneged on the
agreement earlier this month on the grounds that economic conditions in the
east had deteriorated.
'We cannot afford to pay 20 per cent. We will pay in line with inflation,
which is just over 9 per cent,' a spokesman for the steel employers said
yesterday. Wages for eastern German steel workers are 57 per cent of western
German levels, while wages for the region's electrical and metal workers are
currently 70 per cent of western German levels.
IG Metall wants the wages in the two sectors to be increased to 80 per cent
of their western counterparts, even though productivity levels are about 70
per cent lower.
However, other sectors, such as chemicals and construction have agreed on a
9 per cent rise for this year in the east.
In addition, several large enterprises in eastern Germany have already
offered their employees wage increases of between 9 and 15 per cent.
Although IG Metall has instructed the factory unions to reject these offers,
the workforce may be reluctant to vote for an all-out strike. Workers in all
three sectors now fear that if they strike the chance of investment in the
region will decrease as will the possibility of small and medium sized
companies making sufficient profits to themselves invest and create jobs.
IG Metall officials privately admit their concern about these developments
but argue that while large wage increases this year may cost workers their
jobs, they will at least entitle them to greater unemployment benefits.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Rips in the employment featherbed: Christopher Parkes on how
German management has found that traditional ways of cutting payroll costs
are simply not enough to counter the pressures of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN trade unions, after tamely accepting wage increases barely big enough
to cover inflation, have been watching, mute, as the toll of recession on
the west German workforce has mounted. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have
been marked for the axe: some 300,000 in the motor industry alone.
Now, after careful examination of pay and conditions contracts, management
has started ripping away at the very fabric of Germany's employment
featherbed.
Bosch, the electrical, electronics and components maker, for example, told
its domestic workforce that a 3 per cent pay increase due on April 1 will be
paid only on the basic rate. The calculation will exclude all the other
in-house bonuses, allowances, shift premiums, canteen subsidies and payments
for health care and spa cures hitherto included.
Such 'social' cuts were unprecedented, the IG Metall engineering union said.
Then the engineering employers' association in the state of Hesse imposed
similar restrictions on its 340,000 workers, raising 'breach of contract'
charges.
These new tactics demonstrate in the first instance that traditional ways of
reducing payroll costs - early retirement, natural wastage and
state-subsidised short-time working - are no longer enough to counter the
pressure of recession. Forced redundancies are legally fraught and costly,
and virtually unknown in Germany.
Bosch calculates its move will save it DM250m (Pounds 106m) in a full year.
But by squeezing out further savings through the manipulation of pay and
conditions agreements, the employers are pressing dangerously close to the
limits of trade union tolerance.
Despite demonstrations against the acceleration in the already-established
run-down of the western steel industry, the unions' reaction so far to
massive rationalisation in key sectors such as vehicle-building, plant
engineering, machine tools and chemicals, has been distinctly restrained. It
demonstrates widespread acceptance of managements' argument that recession,
coupled with the need for western German industry to regain international
competitiveness, make pay restraint and workforce reductions unavoidable.
However, Germany's biggest union, IG Metall, in particular believes industry
is taking advantage of the slump to further its long-term aim of undermining
the unions' greatest guarantee of influence: the collective bargaining
system. Thus IG Metall has called protest strikes throughout eastern Germany
this week.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union's president, has made his stand on the basis
of an existing 'untouchable' agreement under which all eastern German
engineers should gain pay parity with their western colleagues by next
spring.
Instead of the 26 per cent rise due next month, Gesamtmetall, the federal
employers' association, is sticking to its unilaterally revised 9 per cent
offer - equivalent to the expected inflation rate in the former GDR, a real
award of nil.
Standing alone (other unions including IG Chemie, representing chemicals
workers, and and non-organised employees have already accepted 9 per cent or
less) Mr Steinkuhler says he is fighting for justice, jobs, and to keep
essential skills in the east. As unemployment in the former GDR hovers
around 15 per cent, 10,000 people are moving to the west each month. Without
a supply of skills, he asks, where is the incentive to invest?
Managers in the west put the question differently and apply it to the whole
of Germany. Where is the investment incentive in an economy burdened with
the highest labour costs and most inflexible working practices in the world?
Their answer is implied in an acceleration in the shift of manufacturing
capacity and jobs abroad, where wage costs are lower and unions less
hide-bound.
Over the years, Germany's main unions have engineered a rigid network of
'regional' pay agreements in which a deal in high-tech, highly prosperous
Baden-Wurttemberg, for example, would be taken as the model for comparable
workers all over Germany. Thus, regional basic pay differentials in
metal-working of 15 per cent 20 years ago have been eroded to 2 per cent
today, regardless of differences in living costs or labour market
conditions.
The strain of keeping pace has recently prompted associations representing
medium-sized businesses to threaten to withdraw from the employers'
associations and negotiate independently.
In the strongest reaction so far, IBM Deutschland last year pulled out of
the system and now conducts most of its own wage negotiations. According to
the federal labour office, there are now more than 2,000 plant-level
agreements operating in the west.
Meanwhile, the DGB trade union congress is in disarray. Its negligible
contribution to the recent solidarity pact - a package of measures to
support economic recovery in the east - amply demonstrated its lack of
authority. Its 17 member unions are at war among themselves, especially
those in pursuit of elusive white-collar subscriptions.
Meanwhile, membership continues to fall, and the union voice is becoming
less and less representative of the workforce as a whole. Even before the
current recession, three quarters of trade union members in the west were
blue-collar workers, while more than 60 per cent of the working population
was earning its living in services or from self-employment.
It is abundantly clear that the post-war German economic miracle is not
going to be repeated in the former GDR; the few remaining manufacturing jobs
in the east are under threat, and many IG Metall members openly admit that
it is impossible to justify a 26 per cent pay increase in current
conditions.
Yet Mr Steinkuhler is standing fast in a position which is at best isolated
and at worst untenable. He is gambling on the employers' appreciating that
it is in no-one's interests to humble him now. Senior executives agree that
despite their drawbacks, the trade unions must remain as key and committed
contributors to the consensus-building process which has underpinned
Germany's post-war success and is now helping steer industry through a
wholesale restructuring.
As the protest strikes deadline approached, signs emerged of a way out of
the impasse when several eastern companies offered in-house deals of up to
15 per cent.
The offers bore all the hallmarks of compromise at least partly true to
German tradition. But at least Mr Steinkuhler may enjoy the consolation of
knowing that they would not have been made at all if he had not stuck his
neck out, and that the workers benefiting will appreciate that they have IG
Metall to thank, and stay in the union.

<TEXT>
Orders for engineering products in west Germany fell by 13 per cent in
February compared with the same month a year ago, the German Engineering
Industry Association reported yesterday, Ariane Genillard writes from Bonn.
Orders coming from German producers were 20 per cent below the level of
February last year, while orders from abroad dropped by 4 per cent.
The association said the sharp decrease reflected the recession in the
domestic economy, especially in the steel industry and among the motor
manufacturers. For the three months to February, engineering orders were 20
per cent below the same three months last year. Orders for the whole of 1992
had fallen by 7 per cent. Orders in Germany decreased by 9 per cent. Orders
from abroad fell by 3 per cent.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Schlesinger warns on Emu shortcuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONETARY union between France and Germany could damage German trade and
would not save the European Community's plans for full-scale economic and
monetary union (Emu), Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank,
warned yesterday.
In other countries which had striven for years to maintain stability, such a
step would be seen as discriminatory, he said in Budapest.
Exclusion would affect countries with which Germany had a significant volume
of trade in goods and services, he added.
Mr Schlesinger has often warned against any variants on the Emu project
foreseen in the Maastricht treaties. But yesterday's statement was the
clearest condemnation so far of the notion that France and Germany should
establish a bilateral union in an attempt to save something from the
increasingly troubled Emu project. It also contained his first caution about
possible economic damage to Germany.
Coming so close on the heels of the change of government in Paris, the
speech appeared to be aimed at pre-empting any rehabilitation of the idea of
a two-country collaboration fostered in the past by President Francois
Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
'I consider the argument that there could be in Europe a league A and a
league B to be invalid,' he said. 'First of all the 'elimination game' is
not taking place now but in 1996 or 1998. Second, no country may be excluded
for ever: in the end all are able to join the A league.' Even so, he
stressed, there was no room for indulgence. It was important for all
would-be Emu members to stick strictly to all the economic convergence
criteria.
On current conditions in Germany, Mr Schlesinger said a shift to stable
conditions was detectable, although it was not immediate and not overall.
Meanwhile, Mr Helmut Hesse, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making
central council, said he saw little room for manoeuvre on long-term interest
rates, and suggested that short-term rates, including the discount rate,
would fall only in small steps. Inflation in west Germany, currently 4.3 per
cent, would fall during the year to an annual average of 3.5 per cent.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Hoover executives axed over 'flawed' free flights offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER'S European president and two senior executives were dismissed
yesterday after thousands of complaints from customers over its highly
controversial free flights offers.
Maytag, Hoover's US parent, said the Dollars 30m (Pounds 21m) cost of
ensuring customers received their flights or compensation would be taken as
a charge against its first-quarter profits. It admitted Hoover's name had
been seriously damaged by the 'flawed' promotion, and is setting up a
top-level task force to sort out the situation.
'We are very upset that the Hoover name has been damaged and consequently we
made these management changes,' Maytag said. It admitted that the dramatic
way in which it had reversed its usual policy of not interfering in the
running of its subsidiaries reflected its displeasure over the affair.
Mr William Foust, managing director of Hoover Ltd and president of Hoover
Europe, was re-moved from his post, along with Mr Brian Webb, vice-president
of marketing UK, and Mr Michael Gilbey, director of marketing services. Mr
Foust has been replaced by Mr Gerald Kamman, president of Maytag's vending
equipment company, Dixie-Narco, since 1988. Replacements for the other two
managers have yet to be named.
Maytag said the promotions in the UK and Ireland, which offered customers
two free flights to the US or other holiday destinations in return for
spending more than Pounds 100 on Hoover products, had resulted in
'tremendous difficulties in administration and implementation, plus
significant unanticipated costs'. The travel operators retained by Hoover
had been unable to fulfil their responsibilities and meet the high demand
from customers.
Some 200,000 customers had applied for free tickets, although Maytag was not
sure if all of these qualified. To date, only 6,000 customers have flown.
Thousands of others have complained about not receiving tickets, not being
able to get the dates requested, or waiting for months without hearing the
result of their applications. A hotline at Hoover Europe has been handling
2,000 calls a day.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, who has been calling
for a Department of Trade and Industry investigation into the offer, called
for the sacking of Baroness Denton, the consumer minister. 'The failure of
the minister for consumer affairs to investigate this offer, in spite of
receiving complaints from me since November, now means she has failed
consumers and has to go.'
Mr Leonard Hadley, Maytag chairman and chief executive, said the company
regretted 'the inconvenience it has caused Hoover customers in the UK and
Eire'. Maytag said all customers still waiting for tickets would get their
flights or some form of compensation 'within the terms of the promotion
programme'. An announcement was likely within the next few weeks.
The parent company said it had been aware of the offer from the outset but
not all the details. Problems had arisen after Hoover underestimated the
likely response and overestimated the amount it would earn from commission
payments on associated accommodation, car rental and insurance policy
bookings.
The Consumers' Association, which has received thousands of complaints about
the offer, said it welcomed the 'high-level action' by Hoover to deal with
the effects of a 'badly-administered marketing ploy'.
The BBC consumer programme Watchdog said last night it was due to screen a
programme next Monday alleging the travel company organising the offer has
been trying to dissuade customers from taking up their flights.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Italian corruption scandal claims fifth minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of the Italian government was increasingly precarious last night
following the involvement of a fifth minister in the corruption scandals
sweeping the country.
Mr Franco Reviglio, finance minister, resigned after being served notice he
was under investigation for alleged receipt of illicit funds while chairman
of Eni, the state oil concern, in 1983-89. Over the past two months Mr
Reviglio has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing during his time at Eni.
Earlier President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro called in the heads of the senate and
chamber of deputies as well as Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, for
four hours of consultations. The discussions centred on two main options - a
cabinet shake-up with broader parliamentary support or a new government.
This would have to be an administration headed by an institutional figure
above party politics, such as Mr Giorgio Napolitano, leader of the chamber
of deputies, or Mr Giovanni Spadolini, leader of the senate.
Political uncertainty forced the lira to a historic low against the D-Mark.
The Italian currency pierced the L1,000 level against the D-Mark in Milan
trading and touched L1,004, recovering slightly after the Bank of Italy
intervened to support it on foreign exchange markets. Its London close was
L990.1.
London dealers said that much of the selling of lire was short-term
speculation by bank dealers. However, Italian bond prices fell sharply as
institutional investors sold Italian-denominated assets. On the Milan stock
exchange the Comit index fell 10.56 or 2.1 per cent to 476.91.
Since the weekend the position of the four-party coalition government has
been jeopardised by news that magistrates in Palermo and Naples were
investigating Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat politician
and seven times premier, and two other senior party bosses for alleged links
with the Mafia.
Mr Amato is unlikely to want to proceed without agreement on broader support
 -notably from the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and
the Republicans. Yesterday Mr Scalfaro also consulted Mr Achille Occhetto,
the PDS leader.
Mr Occhetto said he was reluctant to back another Amato government, which he
said was too closely identified with a discredited political class.
The situation was further complicated on Monday, in advance of the April 18
referendums on constitutional reform, by the decision of Mr Mario Segni,
leader of the referendum movement, to break away from the Christian Democrat
party, one of four in the coalition. The PDS is reluctant to come into any
government with the CDs now they have lost Mr Segni, who is identified with
reformist policies.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Decline in liquidations raises hopes of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of a recovery in the UK were buoyed yesterday by news that the number
of companies being put into liquidation has fallen on a year-on-year basis
for the first time in four years.
The first three months of this year saw liquidations of 5,297 limited
companies, compared with 5,603 in the corresponding period last year,
according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information consultancy.
The figures indicate that the business outlook for many relatively large
companies which are limited by guarantee may be brightening, even though
failures among smaller companies are likely to stay high for some time.
Indications that growth may slowly be returning to the UK were supported by
a report of increased confidence in the property market by Chesterton
Financial, chartered surveyors, and a bullish forecast for manufacturing
output from Oxford Economic Forecasting, a consultancy.
Optimism was tempered by the finding from Dun &amp; Bradstreet that total
business failures in the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, continued to rise
in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis, although at a slower rate than
last year. Total collapses include insolvencies of smaller companies, as
well as liquidations.
Mr Philip Mellor, marketing manager for Dun &amp; Bradstreet, said: 'It appears
that larger companies have been making the necessary adjustments and painful
cost-cutting measures to prepare for recovery, while the pain of bankruptcy
will continue for the smaller firms for some time.'
In the first quarter, 15,443 businesses of all types failed, 3.8 per cent up
from 14,881 in the first three months of 1992.
In the whole of last year, 22,938 limited companies went into liquidation,
compared with 20,736 in 1991 and 13,936 the year before. Total business
failures last year came to 62,767, after 47,567 in the previous year and
28,935 in 1990.
Wales recorded 17 per cent fewer business collapses in the first quarter
compared to the previous year, while north-west England, eastern England and
the east Midlands saw failures drop by 10 per cent, 9 per cent and 5 per
cent respectively.
London and the south-east saw falls on the same basis of 4 per cent and 1
per cent respectively. In Scotland, the south-west, the west Midlands and
north-east England the totals rose by 26, 9, 5 and 3 per cent respectively.

FT  31 MAR 93 / Open markets call by US trade chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday assured trading
partners in the European Community that the US would 'champion open markets
and expanded trade'. But he warned that Washington would expect other
markets to be 'comparably open' to US goods and services.
Mr Kantor, speaking in Brussels after talks with European Community
counterparts over US-EC trade problems, said the US remained committed to 'a
prompt and successful completion' of the Uruguay Round of talks on global
trade liberalisation, but repeated US demands that 'some major improvements'
must be made to the draft text of the agreement.
He said success depended on improved access for US companies to the markets
of trading partners. No agreement would be possible 'if Japan continues to
behave as if it had little stake in the outcome'.
A statement from the Japanese embassy in Brussels said Mr Kantor 'had a
misperception'. A Japanese official insisted Japan had 'done its utmost' to
help achieve a successful Uruguay Round outcome, but said it had been
frustrated by US-EC deadlock over reform of farm trade.
Mr Kantor's wider comments in particular raised the question whether the US
in future would prefer to tackle trade problems on an issue-by-issue basis,
through bilateral negotiations and whether, through the reiteration of the
need for 'fair trade', he was suggesting a weakened US commitment to free
trade.
Speaking at a lunch of the EC committee of the American Chamber of Commerce
in Brussels, Mr Kantor was adamant that he refused to 'get bogged down in
long drawn-out theological debates about free trade versus protectionism'.
He said the Clinton administration saw trade 'as a priority element of
American security', and promised a 'more active, anticipatory, inclusive and
flexible' trade policy that would incorporate worries over the environment,
competition policy, international labour standards, science and technology
policy and sustainable growth policies in developing countries.
Mr Kantor did not discuss public purchasing, which was the immediate focus
of US-EC negotiations on Monday. The US has threatened trade sanctions if
the EC does not dismantle an article in its new public procurement law which
discriminates in favour of EC contractors.

FT  31 MAR 93 / French premier gives key posts to free-market partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UDF, the more free-market partner in France's new coalition government,
gained most of the economic posts in the new cabinet announced last night,
with the more nationalist RPR Gaullist party securing responsibility for the
interior and foreign ministries.
President Francois Mitterrand raised no objection to the ministerial list
presented by his new premier, Mr Edouard Balladur, the RPR politician.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, an economics professor turned UDF politician, is
France's finance minister, with the difficult task of maintaining a strong
exchange rate and reducing unemployment, which has now risen above the 3m
level.
Gaining the finance ministry and 15 other ministerial posts in a
slimmed-down 30-member cabinet, the UDF party has obtained ample
compensation for the premier's post going to the RPR. The UDF has also
gained responsibility for external security, with Mr Francois Leotard
becoming defence minister.
Mr Alain Juppe is France's new foreign minister. This is the RPR
secretary-general's reward for his party's success in winning 247 seats in
the new parliament. His opposite number in the UDF, Mr Francois Bayrou, gets
the education portfolio.
Mr Charles Pasqua, a hardline RPR Gaullist with strong views on immigration,
law and order, has returned to the interior ministry which he held in the
last cohabitation government of 1986-88, but he has added planning to his
portfolio. He had sought the defence ministry.
But Mr Leotard's nomination for that job may have been a deliberate ploy by
Mr Balladur to show that the new government means to exercise its rights
more vigorously than the centre-right did when it was last in power under Mr
Mitterrand. In 1986 Mr Leotard's nomination as defence minister was
withdrawn after Mr Mitterrand expressed a preference for a technocrat to
fill that job.
In addition to the finance ministry, the UDF holds most other economic jobs.
Mr Gerard Longuet becomes industry minister, and Mr Alain Madelin, a genuine
free-market liberal, is given charge of policy towards small and medium
sized companies.
While Mrs Simone Veil, the veteran UDF politician and Euro-MP, returns to
government for the first time since 1979 to take charge of social policy,
fully half the cabinet have never held ministerial rank before.
Among them is Mr Jean Puech, a relatively unknown centrist senator who takes
on the key portfolio of agriculture. Another newcomer is Mr Philippe
Douste-Blazy, mayor of Lourdes, who has become health minister. The fact
that he is also mayor of Lourdes may be read by some as an indication of how
determined the government is to cut costs in the public sector.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Semi-Tech advances 23.5% for the
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEMI-TECH (Global), the Hong Kong-based owner of the Singer sewing machine
group, has announced a 23.5 per cent increase in net profits to HKDollars
952m (USDollars 123m) for the year to January 1993, up from HKDollars 771m.
The results included an exceptional gain of HKDollars 578m as a result of
the sale of 16 per cent of its stake in New York-listed Singer. Semi-Tech
retains 51 per cent control of the company.
At the operating level, excluding exceptional items, the company showed a 12
per cent increase in earnings.
Mr James Ting, chairman, said: 'Despite the economic stagnation for most
major economies in the world, the group's performance is satisfactory.'
Semi-Tech recently entered a tentative agreement to purchase a 29 per cent
stake in G. M. Pfaff, a German sewing machine manufacturer, with a further
agreement to increase this stake to 51 per cent.
Mr Ting said: 'Semi-Tech would be able to assist Pfaff restructure, give
Pfaff immediate access to Singer's distribution network, and provide Pfaff
with the right platform to move into China, Vietnam and Latin America.' The
deal would offer synergies with the Singer group, but awaits government and
regulatory approvals.
Semi-Tech is also endeavouring to turn around Sansui, the heavily lossmaking
Japanese consumer audio group it purchased from Polly Peck in mid-1992. It
successfully resuscitated the ailing Singer group, which it purchased in
1989.
The directors recommended a final dividend of 60 cents a share, representing
a full-year pay-out of 83 cents, compared with 76 cents in the previous
year.
In addition, Semi-Tech is to pay-out a special dividend of 30 cents to
reflect the 'turnaround of Singer'.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Timex demonstration ends peacefully
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG demonstration outside the Timex plant in Dundee passed off noisily but
without violence or arrests yesterday, James Buxton writes. A bus carrying
leftwing demonstrators from Glasgow arrived nearly 1 1/2 hours late after
twice being stopped by police.
More than 400 demonstrators gathered outside the plant to protest at the
actions of the US-owned electronics company, which last month sacked its
340-strong manual workforce after a strike and hired 200 new workers. The
demonstrators jeered as buses carrying the new workforce went through the
plant gates but did not attempt to block their path.
Last Monday 16 people were arrested outside the plant in the worst picket
line violence seen in Britain for several years. Ahead of yesterday's
demonstration trade unionists appealed to demonstrators to stay within the
law.
The appeal was aimed at leftwing groups such as Scottish Militant Labour,
which took part in last Monday's demonstration and which said it planned to
bus in demonstrators yesterday.
Police stopped the bus carrying demonstrators from Glasgow near Perth and
again in Dundee. Tayside police said they had wanted to check numbers and
search for weapons to avoid a repetition of last week's violence. The
demonstrators missed witnessing the arrival of the new Timex workers but
were in time for a rally in support of the sacked workers.

FT  30 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Booker conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food group Booker was subject to conflicting pressures as the market
remained divided over the company's prospects. Nomura produced its second
downgrade in a week and turned cautious on the stock, arguing that the food
distribution arm - the most significant contributor to Booker's profits -
would continue under a cloud for the remainder of the year. The house pulled
back its 1993 forecast to Pounds 92m.
Booker's results last week produced a dramatic fall in the share price.
Although largely in line with expectations, certain aspects, such as the
large level of debt, caught analysts by surprise. A cautious accompanying
company statement helped to send the shares into reverse, tumbling from 443p
to yesterday's opening of 400p in just three days. The stock lost 5 to 395p
yesterday.
Kleinwort Benson believes the shares present a good buying opportunity. It
argues that the decline in the stock makes it attractive and that the food
distribution business is well positioned for recovery.
The prospect of another reduction in UK interest rates triggered a further
flurry of buying interest in a banks sector said to be attracting persistent
strong institutional support. Last week's earnings upgrades in Royal Bank of
Scotland saw the shares improve 5 more to 254p on 1.3m traded. Abbey
National added 9 at 382p, TSB 4 1/2 at 173 1/2 p on good turnover of 4.5m
and Lloyds 14 at 523p.
Sun Alliance hardened to 345p after the purchase by its Danish subsidiary,
Codan, of Hafnia's Danish offshoot for Pounds 140m. Mr Nick Bunker,
insurance analyst at Hoare Govett, described the deal as 'an efficient way
of utilising the excess assets within Codan, subject to some caveats about
possible pitfalls within Hafnia's banking business'.
BT shares extended last week's strong performance, climbing 8 to 438p on 8m
dealt. In a comprehensive review of BT, Mr Chris Tucker of Carr Kitcat &amp;
Aitken said the shares 'look cheap on our estimates for the next two years'.
He highlighted BT's recovery profile after two years of recession, high
redundancy costs and large exceptional losses. He said the company 'should
be able to achieve earnings per share and dividend per share growth of 10
per cent in the mid-1990s through improved productivity and strict cost
control'.
In a subdued oil and gas sector, BP continued to catch the eye, closing 4
firmer at 308 1/2 p. Turnover was a disappointingly low 4.8m, with
specialists adding that much of that reflected yet more buying interest in
the shares from across the Atlantic. US investors are thought to speak for
at least 25 per cent of the company's shares. Burmah Castrol moved 7 higher
to 721p, with the market becoming increasingly bullish about the stock ahead
of Thursday's figures.
A flood of statements from Euro Disney, ranging from fresh attendance
figures to plans for new rides, helped to lift the theme park operator 40 to
1125p.
Guinness improved, helped by recent presentations to institutions and a
technical squeeze. The shares jumped 14 to 483p.
There was further speculation over the 10.2 per cent stake in Sears held by
the Al-Fayed brothers, owners of the House of Fraser group.
The market has been rife with rumours for a number of weeks that some
brokers have been testing the water in readiness should the brothers decide
to sell. However, analysts continued to point out that the fact that the
Al-Fayeds bought into the stores group at around 145p suggested a
large-scale placing was unlikely given Sears' current share price. The
shares closed steady at 102p yesterday.
Elsewhere in an otherwise quiet stores sector, Kingfisher again improved
following results last week, and helped yesterday by a NatWest Securities
buy note. The shares firmed 5 1/2 to 563p. Marks and Spencer held steady at
339p. Kleinwort Benson upgraded the high street retailer, moving from Pounds
720m to Pounds 730m for this year and by Pounds 30m to Pounds 800m for the
year after.
Speculative buying of Dalepak Foods saw the shares rebound after their
collapse last week. They closed 21 ahead at 233p.
Following the company's latest profits warning last week, and the subsequent
plunge in the share price, there were suggestions that the company may be
susceptible to bid interest. Dealers mentioned Cargill and ConAgra, two US
agricultural businesses, as potential predators.
Publishing and leisure conglomerate Pearson was the best performer in the
Footsie as its annual results were well received by the market. The group,
which owns the Financial Times, announced 1992 profits of Pounds 150.8m and
an increase in the dividend. Pearson shares strengthened 27 to 404p with
3.3m traded.
Among transport stocks, a further advance in Eurotunnel, which said a
tribunal had ruled in its favour over many of the issues in its dispute with
tunnel builder TML, was checked by talk of a rights issue. The shares firmed
only 2 to 492p. A buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs boosted Tomkins,
which finished 7 better at 251p.
Profit-taking along with an element of caution weakened Inchcape as it
reported favourable figures, leaving the shares 4 lighter at 597p.
The return of bid speculation helped Lucas Industries put on 2 at 139p,
after it reported figures in line with expectations, albeit at a dull
results meeting.
The new five-year deal between the electricity generators and the regional
electricity companies (recs), based on purchases of British coal over the
five-year period, caused little activity in the stock market, where shares
in the generators were marginally higher on the session and those of the
recs no better than mixed.
National Power settled 2 higher at 338p, while PowerGen, quoted ex the 7.15p
dividend, was little changed on the day. Market activity in both shares -
469,000 in National Power and 1.9m in PowerGen - was well below recent
levels, dealers said.
The Scottish generators, now quoted 'cum' the final 70p call on the shares,
showed Scottish Hydro 4 1/2 to the good at 346p.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: The Telegraph directors repeat Southam deal
recommendation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TELEGRAPH, the newspaper group 68 per cent owned by Mr Conrad Black's
Hollinger Group, has sent shareholders a second circular about the Pounds
72.3m deal to buy a stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper company.
The new circular, which was necessitated by the purchase of an 18.8 per cent
stake in Southam by Power Corporation of Canada, again recommends minority
shareholders to vote in favour of the deal. At a special meeting to be held
on April 13 Hollinger will not vote, but holders of 8.3 per cent of the
shares will support the resolution.
The Telegraph has also joined the list of companies paying a second interim
dividend to beat the Budget changes on advance corporation tax. It will pay
the 6.5p dividend on April 5 so allowing shareholders the benefit of a 25
per cent rather than a 20 per cent tax credit.
The circular says that the Power investment in CDollars 180m (Pounds 100m)
new shares in Southam, 'will strengthen Southam's balance sheet' and that
'Power, with Hollinger and The Telegraph, will add to the pressure for an
improvement in Southam's performance'.
The Telegraph's independent directors said that the Telegraph's ability to
influence Southam 'may be diminished by the presence of Power' but an
agreement between Power and Hollinger would mean that the three would be 'a
powerful force for change at Southam'. Together they would hold more than 37
per cent of the shares. They added that the changes to the deal would not
alter the financial effects of the investment on The Telegraph.
The independent directors acknowledged that Power's investment at CDollars

FT  30 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Problems of the
generation gap - Tim Dickson visits a Swiss school specialising in family
business issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the right time for a family business to hand on to the next
generation? How do you deal with family members who are not active in the
firm? How do you go about selling up when you want to retire?
Alden Lank is preoccupied with such issues not because he is actually facing
any of the challenges himself. As Professor of Family Enterprises at the
International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland,
though, he runs twice-yearly courses aimed at resolving them for others.
There are plenty of European academic chairs in small and medium-sized
enterprises or entrepreneurship these days - but IMD claims to be one of
just two business schools on this side of the Atlantic to specialise in the
problems of family firms. The other is at Barcelona.
Lank accepts that there is an overlap with SMEs and entrepreneurship - but
the family business field, he stresses, has its own literature and is by no
means exclusively concerned with the small business.
Family controlled enterprises account for one third of all companies in the
Fortune 500, anything between 75 per cent and 99 per cent of all companies
in the EC, and 65 per cent of GDP and employment in Europe. 'The very small
business - the Mom and Pop shop - is certainly not our cup of tea,'
emphasises Lank.
The macro-economic rationale for his 3 1/2 -day course is that a mere 17 per
cent of start-ups survive into the third generation. It all started because
of the conviction of a second-generation Canadian businessman that
management training was sadly lacking on the European family business scene.
His message initially fell on deaf ears at IMI-Geneva, one of two Swiss
schools that merged to form IMD in 1989. In the end the chair was endowed by
Stefan Schmidheiny, owner and chief executive of the Swiss family group
which developed and marketed the 'Swatch' watch.
An important feature of the IMD course is that family members from two
generations of the same firm often attend, and indeed are encouraged to do
so. 'We've had five members of the same family', says Lank. 'We love it when
the spouse and the children attend. 'They often use the classroom to pass
messages which they couldn't articulate back home. In one case we had a
mother and son effectively blaming each other's generation for what was
going wrong. It was very dramatic. No one was interrupting.'
Adds Joachim Schwass, executive-in-residence at IMD: 'The family influence
can and should be positive. There needs to be a common vision. Disagreements
can sink companies.' Schwass should know, since this is what happened in one
part of his family business.
Rather than the general management skills taught on most business courses,
IMD concentrates on problems of succession, conflict management, the impact
of the family on corporate culture, strategy, remuneration, and governance.
Not surprisingly governance provokes some of the hottest debate, especially
when the subject of non-family directors is raised. 'Individuals have the
chance to meet in small groups to discuss problems of common concern with
others of similar background, as well as with the faculty,' says Lank.
To date the courses have ranged from as few as nine participants ('too few')
to 30 ('the upper limit'). 'Students' have come from as far afield as Chile,
Australia, Singapore, the Philippines and Egypt, although the Scandinavian
countries, Switzerland and the UK tend to be the best markets.
The course is restricted to owner-managers, family owners, and family
managers, though 'outside' chief executive officers are eligible if
accompanied.
The next one will run from June 27-30 and costs SFr8,500 (Pounds 5,666) for
the first participant, and SFr5,000 for each additional family member. Write
to IMD, Registration and Information Office, Chemin de Bellerive 23, 1007

FT  30 MAR 93 / Heseltine tells Commons his plan offers coal's 'best hope'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE last night used the promise of 'hundreds of millions of
pounds' in subsidies to the coal industry in a bid to snuff out a possible
Conservative backbench revolt over last week's government white paper.
There was 'a significant new market to go for', the trade and industry
secretary said, as he defended his white paper in front of a sceptical
Commons. 'We have made it clear that the best hope for British Coal is to
take advantage of the opportunity we have provided.'
But a series of interventions by possible Tory rebels indicated that Mr
Heseltine had not completely calmed fears that the 12 reprieved pits might
not survive for more than a year.
These were played on by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary,
in a spirited plea to Tory MPs to join Labour in voting down the white
paper.
Today was the day for Tories who had voiced displeasure at the original pit
closure announcement last October to make good the promises they had made
five months ago to Britain's mining communities, Mr Cook argued.
The exchanges came as the coal and electricity industries completed the
signing of contracts for the sale of 160m tonnes of coal over five years,
leaving the way clear for talks to begin on extra sales aimed at saving the
12 reprieved pits.
Among Tory backbenchers who intervened in Mr Heseltine's speech, Mr Nicholas
Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield, asked why he was not acting to engineer
a level playing field for coal in competition with other fuels.
Mr Winston Churchill, leader of the Tory backbench coal group, charged
British Coal with 'directly sabotaging' Mr Heseltine's statement to MPs last
week.
British Coal yesterday joined Mr Heseltine in admitting it could not
forecast how big the extra market above the core contract would be. 'The
generators and rest of electricity industry will effectively decide the
future for our pits,' the company said. Prospects would also depend on the
terms of a subsidy to help marginal pits compete.
Mr Heseltine riled opposition MPs by dwelling at length on Labour policy on
coal in the 1970s. This prompted the retort from Mr Cook that the trade and
industry secretary should have spared MPs his 'rendition of a pantomime
villain'.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Bosnia Serbs pressed over peace plan: Nato and CIS defence
ministers issue joint call on Vance-Owen proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE ministers of Nato and the Commonwealth of Independent States
yesterday urged Bosnian Serbs to sign an international peace plan to end the
war in Bosnia, and the US said it might send troops to enforce the
agreement.
While the Croats and Moslems have signed the plan, drawn up by mediators
Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the Bosnian Serbs have so far refused to do
so. 'We call upon the Bosnian Serb leadership to agree to the peace plan,'
defence ministers from Nato, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union said
after their meeting in Brussels.
The Atlantic alliance is planning to send at least 50,000 troops to enforce
the agreement, but only when all parties have signed.
Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian defence minister, said the figure
would probably be around 75,000 but that no country had so far committed
forces to take part.
Mr William Perry, US deputy secretary of defence, told the meeting that
Washington might commit ground forces to help make up the total but did not
say how many.
'Nato should play an important role and the US stands ready to make a
substantial contribution, possibly including ground forces,' he said.
'Contributions from our eastern partners to an implementation force would be
welcome.'
Meanwhile, about 2,140 sick and wounded women, children and elderly were
yesterday evacuated from Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia,
by UN relief workers.
The Moslem evacuees, crowded into 19 lorries, waited in the northern village
of Caparde to cross Serb lines to Tuzla.
At least 45 people in the convoy were critically wounded and all the
remaining were afflicted with scabies and body lice, said Ms Lyndall Sachs,
of the office of UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Diplomats, who believe Srebrenica is the most vulnerable of the few
remaining enclaves in eastern Bosnia, say that despite US air drops the
situation there is still 'very grave'.
Nonetheless, the Bosnian Serb government yesterday protested to the UNHCR
over the use of German military aircraft to drop relief supplies over
eastern Bosnia.
Germany sent its first cargo aircraft to join the US-led air drop mission on
Sunday night.
The Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency quoted the protest note as saying that
this violated an agreement between the Bosnian Serbs, the UN and the US
under which Germany would be excluded from the operation 'owing to
deep-rooted historical reasons'.
Bad weather appeared to favour a ceasefire which came into effect on Sunday.
It was agreed between UN and Serb commanders and later endorsed by Moslem
and Croat leaders.
In Zagreb, the Croatian government resigned, against a background of
increasing economic deprivation. Mr Nikica Valentic, head of Ina, Croatia's
state-owned oil company, was named as prime minister to succeed Mr Hrvoje
Sarinic.
The republic's economy has been hard hit by the war and the influx of some
700,000 refugees.

L21bn foreign exchange loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merloni Elettrodomestici, the Italian white goods group best known for its
Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes brands, has become the most conspicuous
Italian victim of last year's currency turmoil with a L21bn foreign exchange
loss.
Currency factors and a L8bn charge for redundancies and early retirements
led to a collapse in group net profits to L1.6bn last year from L11.7bn in
1991.
The fall in earnings has prompted a sharp dividend cut, with the payout for
ordinary shares being reduced to L20 from L45 and that on savings stock
falling to L50 from L65.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Parmalat improves 24% to L52bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARMALAT, the Italian milk and dairy foods company, raised net group profits
by almost 24 per cent to L52bn (Dollars 32.9m) last year, due partly to a 23
per cent rise in sales to L1,636bn.
Mr Calisto Tanzi, chairman, said sales should reach about L2,800bn this
year, due to further acquisitions in Italy, the US and South America.
Acquisitions this year include a stake in Giglio, an Italian dairy group
with sales of about L400bn; Atlanta Dairy, a US dairy products concern with
about L100bn in turnover; Lacesa, a dairy products group; and the associated
Sodilac company in Brazil, with sales of about Dollars 80m.
Mr Tanzi denied Parmalat planned a imminent rights issue to finance further
purchases.
'For the time being, our ratios are alright as they are. But if interesting
opportunities arise, then we'll have to see,' he said. He confirmed
Parmalat's interest in buying the Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica, subsidiary of
the state-owned SME foods group now being privatised.
At parent company level, Parmalat Finanziaria, reported a slight drop in net
profits to L9.1bn against from L9.5bn in 1991.
In spite of the fall, stemming from a doubling in taxation, the dividend for
ordinary shares is being raised by L5 to L120.

Shares in BM Group, the construction equipment company, fell sharply after a
report that it will make a bigger than anticipated loss of at least Pounds
30m this year, against profits of Pounds 34.6m last year.
Scottish and Northern institutions were quick off the mark, with many London
dealers initially left in the dark, after a story that appeared in early
editions of Saturday's Financial Times.
That early selling sent the stock tumbling to hit a five-year low of 40 1/2
p before steadying to close 5 down at 42p.
Just over a year ago, the shares were trading at around 400p, the company
having reported interim profits of Pounds 17m, but went into retreat in June
last year following the resignation of the chairman.

FT  30 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome sold again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICAL issues were hit heavily yesterday, the slide accounting for
more than 8 points on the FT-SE 100 Index. Wellcome was the principal
casualty, tumbling 56p at one stage as it went ex a 4.8p dividend.
A number of UK securities houses have been taking the view that the sector
is poised to recover, but worries ahead of proposed reforms in the US drugs
market and general concern that margins are being squeezed held sway again
yesterday. Consequently, traders who had held long positions at Friday's
close were caught out when prices fell again.
Wellcome shares lost ground for the fourth trading day in succession and the
decline increased in the afternoon as cautious US investors returned to the
fray. By the close the stock was down 47 at 742p xd on turnover of 4.2m.
Meanwhile, the fortunes of Glaxo suffered further, the shares losing 21 at
576p as the company confirmed a newspaper report that it is to write to
doctors in the US to correct statements made about its best-selling Zantac
ulcer drug. The US Food and Drug Administration criticised Glaxo earlier
this year for promotional material which suggested Zantac was safer than a
rival drug from SmithKline Beecham.
Although SmithKline was not immune from the sector tension - the 'A' shares
dropped 14 1/2 to 392 1/2 p and the Units lost 13 to 344p - some analysts
feel that it will be the first of the three leading UK drugs stocks to
recover.

FT  30 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE derivatives sector suff-ered one of the most uninspiring sessions this
year, with little in the way of economic data to encourage dealing, writes
Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at 2,849, and
after a brief retreat moved steadily forward fuelled by sporadic buying. It
reached the morning's high of 2,867 at around 9.45am.
The early buying soon dried up and the contract declined to test 2,855, seen
in more recent weeks as a market support level. It did indeed prove to be a
resistance point and the contract traded between that and 2,867 over
lunchtime.
The strong opening on Wall Street brought another upward movement in the
June contract. But dealers pointed out that most of the move was technical,
and there was little in the way of actual buying.
It finished at 2,874, a strong premium to the underlying cash market, but
with volume a meagre 4,878 lots by the official close.
The traded options were equally dull, turnover reaching only 14,937
contracts. A mere 4,869 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and 2,298
in the Euro FT-SE option.
Pilkington was the busiest stock option with 1,333 lots transacted after
leading independent derivatives dealer Monument was reported to have carried
out a large trade. It was followed by Glaxo, Lasmo, J. Sainsbury and Asda.

FT  30 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate cut hopes stem fall in equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRUG stocks suffered another bout of selling in London yesterday, but
declines elsewhere in the equity market had been largely recovered by the
close of business. The final loss of 6.4 points on the FT-SE 100 Index took
in a fall of nearly 11 points from ex-dividend adjustments in leading
shares.
The stock market's attention swung back in the direction of interest rates
after suggestions in the UK press at the weekend that Britain's building
societies were considering raising interest rates, including mortgage
charges, because of competition for savings deposits. Such a threat was seen
as direct pressure on the UK government to deliver the cut in base rates
expected by the City of London at Budget time, but discounted by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer.
The outcome of the French elections also put European interest rates in the
spotlight again. UK investors continue to look to the Bundesbank for a lead
to lower rates, although there were doubts whether any move would be made
when the bank's policy-making committee meets in Frankfurt this week.
The new equity trading account opened with shares quickly under pressure as
last week's losses in Wellcome and Glaxo were extended. The technical
markdown prompted by ex-dividend quotations was soon joined by a sell-off in
the stock index futures sector.
The Footsie was soon down by nearly 20 points at 2,833, although outside the
pharmaceuticals there was little selling pressure. It was the absence of any
big selling transactions, as much as any other factor, which laid the basis
for a steady recovery in the second half of the session.
London was also buoyed by a good start on Wall Street, where the Dow
Industrial Average was 24 points up in UK hours, as it responded to
improvements in the latest data on consumer spending and home sales.
At the close, the fall in the FT-SE 100 Index had been cut to 6.4 at
2,846.5. Traders were a little nervous at seeing the 2,850 support level
lost, but remained confident that the institutions would soon move into
equities if the Footsie dipped to the 2,820 area.
A more revealing picture of the day's trading came from Seaq volume of only
484.9m shares, compared with 734.9m on Friday. The paucity of institutional
interest suggested that retail volume was low. Retail, or customer, business
in equities was high all last week, and recorded a value total of Pounds
1.57bn on Friday.
The market was also suffering some indigestion yesterday from last week's
rights issues; 'a rights too far' was the wits' comment. For the immediate
term, the institutions have committed most of their available cash and their
trading books are still holding the rights shares taken aboard.
A test of market confidence will come when two impending new issues reach
the marketplace. Heavy institutional interest was reported yesterday in the
placing and intermediary offer for Hambro Insurance Services.
While most of the market lacked enthusiasm yesterday, properties remained
firm as the signs of recovery in the sector continued to attract support.
Retail issues, although traditionally influenced by interest rate hopes,
remained close to pre-weekend levels.

FT  30 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei at high for year
as economic outlook improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHIFT in investors' views on the economy triggered active buying, and the
Nikkei average gained 1.4 per cent, rising above the 19,000 level for the
first time since March 31 last year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average rose 259.68 to 19,048.38 after opening at the day's
low of 18,829.55 and rising to the session's high of 19,126.38 during the
last half-hour of trading.
Foreign investors and dealers were leading buyers, while most institutions
remained on the sidelines.
Volume totalled 650m shares, against 802m. Advances overwhelmed losses by
913 to 175, with 78 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks surged 26.82 to 1,455.02, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index finished 4.29 firmer at 1,164.48.
In spite of the jump in prices, traders were sceptical about the sharp gains
in some sectors. The market faces a shortage of sellers at present, because
investors need to register their stocks ahead of dividend payments; analysts
said dealers have taken the opportunity to buy up shares.
Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said: 'The obvious target is
the 19,300 level, but the rise seems to be overdone.'
'There seems to be a concerted effort to boost optimism,' said one trader,
referring to local media reports listing recent positive economic data.
Rising speculation about a larger than expected economic stimulus package
also lifted sentiment.
The increase in speculative trading lifted Aids-related issues. Tsumura rose
by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,230 on reports of a new anti-Aids
discovery. Green Cross, a speculative favourite, put on Y20 at Y1,310.
Gas and electric utilities, which have high dividend ratios, were the day's
top performers. Gas utilities gained 10 per cent, led by Tokyo Gas, up Y49
at Y500, while electric power shares rose 6.6 per cent, Tokyo Electric Power
ending Y370 higher at Y3,290.
Iseki, a farm machinery maker, climbed by its daily limit of Y80 to Y406 on
an announcement that the company will become a component stock of the Nikkei
average, replacing Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, which will be delisted following its
merger with Jujo Paper that becomes effective this week.
High-technology issues were higher on active buying. Hitachi moved forward
Y17 to Y845 and Toshiba advanced Y25 to Y683.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 381.05 to 20,346.92 in volume of 40.4m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed, with Taiwan closed for a public holiday.
HONG KONG fell prey to market rumours that China would dump shares of
Jardine Matheson and boycott it for important mainland construction
projects. Jardine, a key component of the Hang Seng index, ended HKDollars
1.25 lower at HKDollars 47.50, pulling the index as a whole down 18.35 to
6,322.90 in turnover of HKDollars 2.96bn, compared with Friday's HKDollars
3.53bn.
The index had recorded modest gains through most of the day amid hopes that
the Hong Kong Governor will not submit his democratic reform bill to the
legislature for debate at the end of March, which would raise the
possibility that Sino-British talks on Hong Kong might resume.
AUSTRALIA took its lead from Tokyo, with a late rally taking the All
Ordinaries index 1.1 higher to 1,677.0 in turnover of ADollars 292.8m.
Poseidon was 5 cents ahead at ADollars 2.42 and Plutonic Resources 10 cents
up at ADollars 2.80.
News Corp declined 6 cents to ADollars 7.36 in volume of 4.3m shares after
Mr Rupert Murdoch's agreement to buy the loss-making New York Post.
BHP picked up 4 cents to ADollars 14.88 as it said wage talks with unions
would resume tomorrow after the one-day strike that closed the company's
steel mills yesterday.
SINGAPORE found selective buying support, which took the Straits Times
Industrial index 9.96 higher to 1,670.72.
Singapore Bus Service, which announced a one-for-five scrip issue on Friday,
topped the gainers, ending 25 cents stronger at SDollars 7.45.
SEOUL was lower for the fifth consecutive session, with vehicle shares the
only sector to buck the trend of across-the-board selling. The composite
index dipped 3.27 to 653.21.
BANGKOK saw selling of bank, finance, brokerage and property shares which
left the SET index down 9.40, or 1.1 per cent, at 858.04, the sixth
consecutive daily decline.
KUALA LUMPUR closed higher on renewed speculative and institutional buying
and the composite index rose 4.45 to 638.87. MANILA was disrupted by power
blackouts, a computer system which crashed when a generator broke down, and
a mild earthquake. The composite index shed 10.91 to 1,440.10.
BOMBAY fell under selling pressure from investors needing funds to settle
tax payments for the 1992/93 fiscal year ending March 31. The BSE index lost
64.52, or 2.8 per cent, to 2,276.90, a broker saying that, apart from tax
matters, rights and public issues continued to have an adverse effect.

FT  30 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt's volume fails to
match share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were reactive in character, writes Our Markets Staff. Frankfurt rose
after last week's falls; Paris returned to the upgrade after Wall Street
came in higher; and the drop in the lira to a new record low weighed on a
lethargic Milan.
FRANKFURT saw higher financials and chemicals, constructions and steels as
the DAX index closed 13.63 higher at 1,674.92. However, dealers said that
prices were not matched by volume; turnover dropped from DM7.2bn to DM4.7bn.
Financials reflected interest rate hopes again after a fortnight of
underperformance, Commerzbank rising DM4.50 to DM297.50. Bayer and Schering
led chemicals, the former after relative weakness on Friday as brokers
Julius Bar in Frankfurt noted a developing taste for cyclicals.
Among steels, Thyssen rose DM3.40 to DM171 on the hope that the current
round of price increases might stick. In constructions, Hochtief led with a
DM21 rise to DM1,153 as German mortgage banks put out encouraging figures on
new housebuilding loan approvals.
Tertiary stocks saw falls in Continental and AEG, the former down DM3.60 to
DM214 after the state of Lower Saxony said that it will detail a plan to buy
Pirelli's stake in Conti tomorrow - ignoring Pirelli's trumpeted price of
DM230 a share - and AEG responded to a negative weekend report. However,
Bremer Vulkan rose DM4.10 to DM79 as rumours of a big shipbuilding contract
for China were revived.
PARIS was helped in the afternoon by futures-linked buying, particularly by
US brokers, and the CAC 40 index closed 8.08 higher at 2,033.86 after an
earlier low of 2,013.33, and a high of 2,045.31.
Turnover was FFr3.15bn. Rumours abounded, said Mr Michael Woodcock, French
market analyst at Nikko Europe. Features included the hotel group, Accor,
down FFr29 to FFr688 although it denied talk of a rights issue; a similar
tale left Eurotunnel 90 centimes lower at FFr41.25. Conversely, a story that
Carnaud Metal Box had sold its MB Caradon stake at FFr200 a share left the
former FFr6 higher at FFr213.80.
Elsewhere, Alcatel was FFr9 higher at FFr665 as its cable subsidiary
announced a Greek contract. There were buyers around for Eurodisney, FFr2.10
higher at FFr94 as its prospects seemed to improve, and Credit National rose
FFr17 to FFr1,320 as 2 per cent of the equity went through the market
towards the end of the day.
MILAN was paralysed by a work slowdown, traders protesting at an unexpected
change in trading procedures as the bourse prepare to expand screen based
trading. The Comit index edged 0.55 higher at 487.07.
Fiat added L150 to L5,850 as rumours of an international disposal continued.
Analysts noted that the shares were quoted at L5,890 on SEAQ International,
the screen-based trading system for international stocks in London.
Benetton dipped L220 to L15,080: its 12 per cent rise in 1992 net profit
came after the market closed .
ZURICH was lifted by anticipation of this week's corporate results, and the
SMI index rose 16.3 to 2,176.3.
Ciba registered rose SFr5 to SFr614 ahead of today's results, expected to
include a healthy rise in profits. Roche, reporting on Thursday, rose SFr40
to SFr4,104. Adia was not so lucky after last Friday's figures and its
warning of a possible loss for 1993; the bearers fell SFr13 to SFr120.
Meanwhile, Leu Holding gained SFr20 to SFr395 and Elektrowatt SFr60 to
SFr2,850 on rumours that CS Holding, their parent company, intended to
divest its interests. CS Holding, which denied the reports, closed SFr40
higher at SFr2,290.
AMSTERDAM moved Nutricia, the specialist food group, to centre stage after
Friday's results but the CBS Tendency index was unchanged at 106.40
reflecting the otherwise thin trade.
Nutricia, whose 1992 results were in line with expectations, added Fl 6.50
or 5.4 per cent to Fl 125.50 with investors encouraged by its forecasts for
1993.
Heineken rose Fl 1.20 to Fl 192.50 after a day's high of Fl 194.20, with
foreign demand noted after a positive article in Barrons.
KLM dipped 10 cents to Fl 28.10 in response to suggestions yesterday that
the resignation of the finance director, late on Friday was due to
differences of opinion over company strategy.
MADRID closed with the general index 1.14 higher at 239.79 in healthy
turnover of Pta21.73bn, dealers saying that the market had reached a key
resistance level.
Construction companies were among the day's strongest performers, Cubiertas
putting on Pta400, or 7.3 per cent to Pta5,840 Agroman, Asland and Dragados
all rising by more than 3 per cent. Real estate companies were also healthy.
Bami and Prima Inmobiliaria each advancing by more than 5 per cent.
OSLO registered a 10-month high, the all-share index edging up 1.25 to
450.77 in active turnover worth NKr375.2m on the expectation of further
falls in interest rates.
ISTANBUL scored a 1.9 per cent gain after its six-day holiday, the market
index rising 108.51 to 5,764.94.

FT  30 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong and Mexico lead the field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S equity market slowed its rise last week and this, with both the US
and Europe in negative territory, was barely enough to lift the FT-Actuaries
World Index to a token gain in local currency terms.
The top performers were Hong Kong and Mexico. Of Hong Kong, Mr Hugh Peyman
of Kleinwort Benson is not bullish, in spite of last week's uptick on more
conciliatory noises from Chinese officials.
'No quick solution is yet in sight,' says Mr Peyman, 'and the best guess
remains that no accommodation will be reached until late second quarter at
the earliest. By then another dark cloud will be looming ..in the shape of
the overheating Chinese economy that will have to be brought under control
with some brutish instruments that will send shudders through the economy.'
Mexico resumed its recovery. Latin American Securities says that lower
interest rates and improved sentiment on the North American Free Trade
Agreement, prompted by positive declarations from Mr Richard Gephardt, the
US house majority leader who had been generally perceived as opposing the
agreement, seem to have sparked off an intensification in the buying plans
of some investors.
In Europe, politics moved German and French sentiment in opposite
directions. Like Austria, the week's worst performer, Germany suffered on
Monday and Tuesday from the previous week's Russian crisis, and a tacit
acknowledgement that the market needed a correction left little scope for
general recovery.
France waited for last weekend's second round elections to confirm the
crushing defeat of the socialists and responded, meanwhile, to stimuli like
Thursday's comments by Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the successful Gaullist
RPR party, that economic growth was essential for the country - suggesting
to some investors that lower interest rates could be on the way.

FT  30 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finds new support in
firmer bonds
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
A COMBINATION of futures-related program trading, end-of-quarter buying, a
firmer bond market, and broadly positive economic news lifted leading US
stock prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 15.12 up at 3,455.10, although well
below its high for the day of a near-record 3,478. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
finished 2.99 stronger at 450.77, but the American SE composite was 0.16
easier at 419.31 and the Nasdaq composite off 0.78 at 680.76. New York SE
trading volume was relatively light at 200m shares.
The markets opened against a background of mostly positive news. Bond
prices, which had tumbled last week on fears of inflation, pushing up
long-term market interest rates in the process, staged a modest morning
rally. This eased equity investors' fears that bond prices were in a
freefall.
The day's economic statistics were generally supportive of equities. The
Commerce Department announced that new single-family home sales rose 4.6 per
cent in February, and that personal income increased by 0.2 per cent last
month. Although both figures were weaker than market forecasts, the
department also reported a stronger than expected 0.6 per cent rise in
personal consumption for February.
Other factors helping equity prices included some futures-related program
buying, and demand from portfolio managers looking to improve the
performance of their holdings before the end of the first quarter -
so-called 'window dressing'.
Generally, market analysts expect prices to retain a positive bias for most
of the week. Friday will be a pivotal day, however, because of the release
of the closely watched March employment report, which will give an
up-to-date view of how the labour market is responding to the growing
economy.
Among individual stocks, IBM was bought heavily in early trading, rising
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/4 , before retreating to end Dollars  1/4 up
at Dollars 51 5/8 after volume of 2.0m shares. The buying was seen as a
spillover from last Friday, when the stock rose on confirmation that Mr
Louis Gerstner, former head of RJR Nabisco, had been appointed as IBM's new
chairman.
Airline issues were in demand. Delta, which announced plans to sideline
hundreds of pilots and aircraft, jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 54 3/4 .
AMR rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 1/2 and UAL added Dollars 2 5/8 at
Dollars 124 7/8 .
News Corp held steady at Dollars 41 1/4 in spite of a downgrade from the
sector analyst at brokerage house Alex Brown, who was responding to the news
that Mr Rupert Murdoch, News Corp's chief executive, had agreed to take over
the loss-making New York Post tabloid newspaper.
Hit by a broker's downgrade was Harley-Davidson, which declined Dollars  5/8
to Dollars 37 3/4 after Salomon Brothers lowered its rating on the
motorcycle manufacturer from 'buy' to 'hold', citing the recent run-up in
the stock's price.
Canada
TORONTO saw active trading. The TSE 300 index was finally down 14.5 at
3,585.2, although winning issues narrowly led losers by 346 to 339. Volume
amounted to 53.7m shares valued at CDollars 438.1m.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Sterling bullish again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS much better sentiment about another UK base rate cut in the
sterling money markets yesterday, following newspaper reports that building
societies were threatening to raise their mortgage rates because of the
government's National Savings policy, writes James Blitz.
Several of Britain's biggest building societies were reported to be angry at
the government's issue of a new First Option bond, and at new regulations
increasing the amount that could be invested in national savings.
The building societies have threatened to raise rates to try and staunch the
flow of funds into the government's hands. This has prompted speculation
that the UK authorities might respond to the situation by lowering base
rates again.
Easier conditions in the day-to-day cash market also helped to ease period
rates. The Bank of England forecast a very small shortage of Pounds 50m at
the start of the day, later revised up to Pounds 350m. The overnight cost of
borrowing sterling in the interbank market was as low as 5 per cent for most
of the day.
In these conditions, three-month sterling cash fell to a close of around 5
15/16 per cent, having been above 6 per cent for most of the last two weeks.
One-year money ended down at 5 13/16 per cent from a previous 5 15/16 per
cent on Friday night.
Short-dated futures climbed sharply, with some dealers suggesting that the
contracts had been heavily oversold last week. The March contract finished
10 basis points ahead at 94.26 and the September contract up 12 basis points
at 94.43. At this level, the market is coming close to pricing another 50
basis points off base rates by the autumn.
In the German money market, futures prices were mostly unchanged as many
dealers awaited the outcome of this week's operations by the Bundesbank.
However, call money, which measures the overnight cost of borrowing D-Marks,
continued to move sharply lower, following the reduction in three-day
Treasury Bill interest rates last week.
Liquidity levels in the market remained comfortable as the end of the month
approached, pushing call money down to around 8.16 per cent, from 8.31 per
cent on Friday. According to one London-based dealer, the fall in call money
should bring down the rate in the Bundesbank's repo this week.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira tumbles to an historic low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIRA tumbled to an all-time low against the D-Mark yesterday, undermined
by the investigations into the alleged criminal connections of Italian
politicians, writes James Blitz.
The Italian currency reached its lowest point in history of L991.50 against
the D-Mark at the start of European trading yesterday, but later recovered
ground to close at L987.6, some L11.5 down on the day.
The currency came under heavy selling pressure in the European morning after
weekend reports that Italian magistrates had told Mr Giulio Andreotti, the
former prime minister, that he was under investigation for possible
connections with organised crime.
The inclusion of the highly respected Mr Andreotti in the investigation of
officials appeared to imply that the political crisis in Italy had few
bounds. The rise in Italy's projected budget deficit for this year to 167
trillion lire also helped to depress the currency.
Dealers said the Bank of Italy intervened on currency markets, buying the
lira as it hit the historic low. Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank
in London, said that if the currency crossed L991.50 to the D-Mark again,
the next support level would be L1035.
Far from weakening on the morrow of the second round in France's National
Assembly election, the French franc rallied strongly. It closed at FFr3.393
to the D-Mark from a previous close of FFr3.405.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London,
believes that if the franc holds to this level until Thursday, the Bank of
France may cut its intervention rate, currently at 12 per cent.
However, he believes the French franc may come under a speculative attack
once the new prime minister and government have been named. Several
economists pointed out that the franc's rally yesterday was not underpinned
by large- scale flows into the currency.
Sterling fell back  1/4 pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, because of
renewed speculation in the UK that the government might be forced to bring
down interest rates again.
UK building societies have threatened to put up mortgage rates in an attempt
to compete with the high rates on the British government's National Savings
instruments. The pound closed at DM2.4275.
The dollar continued to look very soft against the D-Mark in spite of a
reasonably strong set of US economic indicators, including a rise in
February's single homes sales by 4.6 per cent.
The market failed to respond to the indicators, partly because of low
volumes and book squaring at the end of the first quarter. However, the
dollar is capped by expectations that Friday's non-farm payroll figure will
be weak, rising by a modest 80,000 in the view of some dealers.
The dollar closed at DM1.6280, down about  1/4 pfennig on the day. In New
York it finished lower at DM1.6258.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (12): A modest leader's
identity problem - Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister, talks to Anthony
Robinson and Laura Silber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of newly independent Slovenia and Slovakia both think they have
the same problem - that the world mistakes one for the other. Mr Vladimir
Meciar, the Slovak prime minister, complains: 'We are at the heart of Europe
but no-one knows us. Foreigners always confuse Bratislava (the Slovak
capital) with Belgrade (the capital of the warring rump of Yugoslavia), and
Slovenia with Slovakia.'
Mr Janez Drnovsek, the quiet-spoken polyglot who is the prime minister of
Slovenia, has an additional problem. He is slightly miffed that people
sometimes confuse Slovenia and Slovakia, but recognises that this is largely
because the names of the two republics are so similar, especially when
written in their respective languages. Slovakia, for example, is called
Republika Slovenska in the Slovak language.
But a more important problem for the 42-year-old Liberal Democrat leader is
to ensure that there is no confusion between peaceful, newly-independent and
ethnically-homogeneous Slovenia and Slavonia, rather than with Slovakia.
For Slavonia is the war-torn north eastern region of Croatia whose Serb
minority, backed by Serbia and the Serb controlled army, revolted against
Croatian independence in June 1991 and fought a bloody war which reduced
such towns as Vukovar and Osijek to ruins and led to a mass exodus of ethnic
Croats from the mixed areas. Slavonia is one of the great victims of the
war.
As President of the Yugoslav Federal Republic for the year ending May 1990,
Mr Drnovsek saw first hand how the federal state withered in the hot breath
of Serbian nationalism. Misha Glenny,in his recent book, The Fall of
Yugoslavia, tells of the humiliation that Mr Drnovsek had to endure at the
hands of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader, who invited him to an
unrestrained pageant of Serb nationalism at the 600th anniversary of the
Serb defeat by the Ottomans at Kosovo Polje in June 1389.
This took place shortly after Mr Drnovsek assumed the chair of the revolving
presidency, and must have convinced him early on of the doomed nature of the
Yugoslav experience. His official CV, which lists the important events of
his presidency, records his attendance at the 200th anniversary of the
French Revolution celebrations in Paris and the Independence ceremonies in
Namibia. It does not mention Kosovo Polje.
Just two years after his public exposure to raw Serb nationalism, however,
Mr Drnovsek was negotiating with Serb generals over the withdrawal of the
federal army from Slovenia after its humiliating defeat in the 10-day 'war'
which followed Slovenia's declaration of independence on June 25 1991.
Slovenia gave the Titoist system its main ideologue, in the shape of Edward
Kardelj, but also its most pragmatic, reformist 'communists.' Mr Drnovsek
was one of them. But in March 1992 he became president of the Liberal
Democratic party, reviving a political tradition which dates back to the
late 19th century when Slovenia spawned a number of small Liberal and
Christian Democrat orientated parties during the last decades of Habsburg
rule.
A month later, Mr Drnovsek - a former construction company manager, banker
and diplomat - became prime minister of the second post-independence
government, replacing the government headed by Mr Lojze Peterle, the
Christian Democrat leader, who is now foreign minister and deputy prime
minister in the present government.
In December last year Mr Drnovsek led his party to victory in the general
elections, emerging with 25 per cent of the seats in the 90-seat national
assembly. A month later parliament approved his new coalition government of
Liberals, Christian Democrats and the 'associated list' of four left-wing
parties dominated by reform communists.
This is the government now ruling Slovenia. 'The main goal of our coalition
is to create stable government for the next four years and carry out our
programme of modernisation,' Mr Drnovsek says.
Ideologically, the coalition would be more consistent if limited to the
Liberals and the Christian Democrats with their more rurally-orientated,
conservative support. 'But this is a government which will have to do
unpopular things, like reduce real incomes and restrain government spending.
There will be strong pressures on the government and we decided to bring in
the left-wing parties, with their links to the unions, to broaden our
majority.'
At present, party loyalty and discipline are unreliable 'but I hope that in
the course of this parliament there will be a normalisation of the political
scene,' he says. 'My party stands for western rules in both the economy and
in politics. In future, our base will be in the middle class. I just hope
that will prove to be enough,' he adds.
The government's critics in the 'associated list' parties accuse it of being
slow to build a fair taxation system and complain about the emergence of a
flashy 'new rich' class. Most have got rich quick through trading, some of
it shady and linked to the war, some of it organised through the
exploitation of old nomenklatura links with the former regime, says Mr Vojko
Venisnkik, a reform communist.
The left-wing parties voice similar complaints about privatisation, which is
slow to get off the ground, and remains largely in the hands of the old
'self-management' factory managers.
At the other end of the spectrum, rising unemployment and the erosion of
workers' 'historic social rights' have led to a fall in real incomes among
the poor who are being wooed from left and right. Right-wing nationalists,
such as Mr Zmago Zelencic of the Slovenian National Party, accuse refugees
of taking jobs and bread from the mouths of native Slovenes, but the party
has now split into two factions and remains on the sidelines of politics.
More jobs will be lost in such sectors as railways, steel and energy which
badly need new management and an end to overmanning if they are to become
competitive. The private sector is not yet vigorous enough to take up the
slack and privatisation, initially, will lead to further job losses.
The problems facing the government are likely to get worse before getting
better. But they appear to be manageable in this small, beautiful country
close to European markets. Among Slovenia's plus points can be counted a
strong currency, a tradition of skilled labour, a competent team of economic
reformers in the key ministries and institutions - and a political class
with modest leaders and realistic aims.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (11): Bohinj is still far
from the battle - Prospects for the tourist in what remains an area of
unspoilt beauty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SNOW-SPECKLED slopes slide into the shores of a crystal lake. Wooden chalets
dot mountain pastures. Giant evergreens and silvery birches line mountain
paths. Is this Switzerland? No, it's Lake Bohinj in Slovenia.
Nestled in the Julian Alps under Triglav, Slovenia's highest peak, Bohinj,
like nearby Bled and Kranjska Gora, boasts unspoilt beauty and year-round
outdoor activities, from hiking to sailing.
It is easily accessible by car, aeroplane or rail and foreigners should be
flocking to enjoy the Slovene Alps at prices some 30 per cent below those in
neighbouring Austria.
But just about everyone in the tourist industry complains that the nearly
90,000 beds are not filled to capacity except at the height of the summer
season.
Getting tourists to come back to Slovenia is a high priority. The country
would appear to be a natural winner because from the Alps to the tiny
stretch of Adriatic coast, Slovenia offers good value for holiday makers.
Tourism was the single biggest earner in 1992, officially amounting to
Dollars 670m, but in fact well over Dollars 1bn when private transactions
are taken into account.
But Mr Joze Mencinger, an economist at the Ljubljana law faculty, believes
that tourism will probably never account for more than 10 per cent of
Slovenia's hard currency earnings. 'The mountains are too low - but at the
same time they are too steep for real skiing. The 46-kilometre coastline is
too short and Koper, Slovenia's only port, takes up 10 kilometres and needs
to be developed further,' he says.
Before the break-up of Yugoslavia, Slovenia was awash with tourists. In
1990, some 55 per cent came from abroad and the remainder from other parts
of the country. Slovenia was often included in foreign package tours.
British tour operators, for example, used to book up hotels at Lake Bled for
holiday makers en route to Croatia's Adriatic coast. Coach operators stopped
in Slovenia as part of tours from northern Italy through to Austria.
Everyone in the tourist industry complains that Slovenia is nearly unknown.
If it is known, foreigners shy away, associating it with the bloodshed in
former Yugoslavia.
Mr Miro Mulej, head of the Lake Bled tourist association, describes the
surprise of foreign visitors when they visit Bled, a mini-Lake Cuomo. 'They
envision tanks rolling down the streets. They don't understand we have a
proper border with Croatia. Slovenia has had no violence since the 10-day
war in June 1991.
'When foreigners arrive, they see we have everything. From natural beauty to
exclusive shops,' Mr Mulej says of Lake Bled, which offers a wide range of
activities from casinos to golf.
'But building a new image for Slovenian tourism is an expensive business,'
he adds. The high quality of the tourist information material put out by the
industry and its operators reflects the effort to attract foreign
holiday-makers. But Slovene tour operators are aware that their
sophisticated, well-designed brochures will yield little until foreign
partners realise that Slovenia is no longer part of Yugoslavia and that it
is far away from the war.
Slovenia is listed in the Thomson tour catalogue, but so far there have been
few advance bookings. In 1988, Slovenia was a favourite charter spot for
some 700,000 British tourists.
'We must forge a completely new identity: Slovenia as an alpine country. It
is the opposite of the image of Yugoslavia with an Adriatic coast and
islands,' says Mr Mulej looking out at Lake Bled, which boasts Slovenia's
only island, dominated by a beautiful Baroque-steepled church.
Tourist officials have taken steps to forge a new image for Slovenia. Mr
Bogo Umek, under-secretary for tourism, says: 'About 52 per cent of Slovenia
is covered with forests. We have the alps and spas, the Adriatic sea coast
is decoration.'
Mr Umek believes Slovenia's membership of the pentagonal Alpine Commission
was an important step for tourism. Lake Bled last year was featured on the
cover of the Commission's brochure.
Slovenia is eager to emphasise individual tourism rather than the mass tours
of the past. Mr Janko Humar, marketing director of Alpinum, which owns and
operates six hotels around Lake Bohinj, says: 'Bohinj has some 1,000 beds.
We do not want mass tourism, but individual visitors who want to enjoy the
spectacular surroundings.'
Over the past five years, Alpinum has upgraded its hotels, emphasising the
quality of service, which was so often lacking for foreign visitors to the
former Yugoslavia. 'We teach the staff that service is a profession to take
pride in,' he adds. The staff at the charming Hotel Jezero, set on the
shores of Lake Bohinj, is courteous and hospitable.
Rock-climbing and white- water rafting may interest some holidaymakers at
Bohinj. The less adventurous can walk on the well-marked paths in Triglav
national park or enjoy the annual festival - the dance of the cows - which
marks the time when peasants take their stock up to the mountain pastures
for the summer.
Kozolci, Slovenia's wooden hayracks - a tradition dating back to the 17th
century - distinguish Lake Bohinj from Switzerland. But here, when holiday
makers tire of swimming, skiing, or trout-fishing, they can hop in the car
and after just an hour's drive, arrive at the short but lovely Adriatic
coastline.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (10): Bibulous appeal of
fine design - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOVENIA produces too little wine to make much impact in a world of wine
lakes and over-production. But pouring drinkable wines into beautifully
designed bottles is one of the ways the tiny Alpine country is trying to
sell its products on foreign markets.
Slovenia produces about 521,000 hectolitres of wine a year. Teran from the
western Karst region and rieslings from the northern Stajersko are among the
most famous.
A few years ago private vintners started to market their wares in bottles
designed by industrial artists and architects. The trend caught on as the
larger state-owned vineyards followed suit.
Gently sloping smoky grey bottles or odalisque flasks with elongated necks
make a beautiful addition to any wine cellar or dinner-table. Mr Oskar
Kogoj, a noted local artist, has designed a wide range of bottles. They and
his other graceful creations can be seen in Regent Street, London from April
19 to May 5 at the Liberty's show on Slovene industrial design.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (7): Lasko is reaching
out - A look at one of Europe's biggest breweries, now seeking international
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCATED in a town of 5,000 inhabitants in the hills of eastern Slovenia, the
Lasko brewery is one of Europe's biggest. Though it is seeking international
markets, it is definitely not looking for foreign investment.
'We need to break into markets abroad. But we are in search of sales, not
foreign investment,' emphasises Mr Franci Jontes, marketing director of the
brewery.
He and his colleagues fear that foreign competitors may try to buy out the
brewery - but only to close it down. It would not be the first time this has
happened since Lasko was founded in 1825. 'A German cartel bought out the
shares and shut the brewery in 1927; we do not want to repeat the
experience,' he says.
'Local entrepreneurs rescued Lasko, which resumed production in 1938. But
the Germans took over the factory during the second world war. A joint
Allied bombardment hit the nearby railway bridge but also razed the brewery
towards the end of the war,' says Mr Gorast Setina, the public relations
manager.
Confident that the black and gold label Zlatorog beer ranks among Europe's
finest, Mr Jontes is hoping to boost foreign sales.
Slovenia's 2m citizens are fond of Lasko beer, but they cannot possibly
drink more than a fraction of the 2.5m hectolitres (about 55m gallons) which
the riverside brewery is capable of producing every year. Most of it used to
be sold to former Yugoslavia, particularly Croatia whose Adriatic coast
attracted millions of thirsty tourists before the war.
Lasko has been through trying times, but Mr Jontes admits the past few years
have been among the toughest. The brewery is still reeling from the loss of
its Yugoslav markets since 1991.
'Overnight, our sales dropped by 45 per cent,' he says. Croatia, Slovenia's
southern neighbour, accounted for 41 per cent of total sales in 1990, but
only 7 per cent last year. Sales to Croatia stopped completely for six
months after October 1991, when Slovenia introduced its new currency, the
tolar.
Lasko was forced to cut costs, sacking 140 workers. Mr Jontes believes the
current labour force of 480 will be reduced by another 25 per cent over the
next three years.
He cites high customs duties to neighbouring Austria and Italy as a major
obstacle to bolstering sales. 'We need reciprocal customs duties. In
Ljubljana, you can buy Goesser, a popular Austrian beer, as readily as
Lasko. Goesser pays 37 per cent customs duty but we must pay 60 per cent to
sell our beer on their markets,' he complains.
Like many Slovene exporters, Mr Jontes believes the exchange rate of the
national currency makes his job more difficult. 'It does not pay to sell our
product below a certain price. But inflation and the strong tolar cut into
earnings.'
Product recognition is also a problem. Mr Jontes says Lasko is working with
Charlemagne Strategies, a London-based marketing firm, to help break into UK
and other markets.
Exports accounted for 11 per cent of total sales in 1991, of which Croatia,
Italy and Austria were the biggest markets. He says Lasko recorded a profit
of DM4m in 1992.
But the drop in sales has forced Lasko to cut production. Last year the
brewery produced 1.4m hectolitres, less than 60 per cent of capacity.
Lasko's managers are strongly opposed to foreign ownership. The brewery is
still socially-owned, which means that the workers own the company, instead
of the state or private individuals. Under the privatisation law passed by
the Slovene government in November last year, Lasko's workers have the right
to buy out the majority of the company shares.
But the situation is not that simple. The prewar, pre-nationalisation
shareholders have also demanded that their interests be taken into account.
Mr Jontes expects to reach agreement in the near future over the division of
shares with former owners.
The Lasko brewery is the biggest employer in the region. Over the past
decade, it has acquired a local spa, hotels and a 12th century castle, Grad
Tabor.
Set on a high ridge above the town, the castle affords wide views of the
barley fields in the Savinska valley which provide much of the malt for
Lasko beer. Mr Jontes sits in Grad Tabor, now a popular regional restaurant,
sipping his golden Zlatorog and hoping for better times. 'All we need is a
fair crack of the whip and the quality of our beer will do the rest,' he
says.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (8): Capitalism is a
bitter pill - Profile of LEK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAQUE above the entrance to the Lek pharmaceutical company's elegant,
10-storey headquarters in the industrial suburbs of Ljubljana records the
proud opening in 1991.
But 1991 was a bad year to take on board such an expensive addition to fixed
costs. Former Yugoslavia was disintegrating into a patchwork of warring
mini-states with inconvertible currencies and hyper-inflation. Comecon
markets, and especially the former Soviet market, were in a state of shock
following the switch from the rouble to hard currency trade.
For Lek, like other Slovene exporters, these developments threatened the 40
per cent of sales which used to go to Yugoslav markets and much of the
remaining 40 per cent of output exported to Comecon, third world and other
markets.
The pharmaceutical industry has suffered less than producers of goods that
can more easily be substituted or for which purchases can be deferred. But
output from Lek's six plants fell 25 per cent last year, according to Mr
Metod Dragonja, the managing director. Higher domestic prices on the Slovene
market helped boost local sales from 20 to 30 per cent of the lower total.
However, the rest of former Yugoslavia is now taking only 32 per cent of
sales.
Pharmaceutical exports to Serbia are exempt from the UN trade embargo. But
sharply declining real incomes, hyper-inflation and inconvertible currencies
mean that an increasing portion of the declining trade is taking place on a
barter or semi-barter basis.
The unchanged 40 per cent of exports to other markets reflects limited
success in switching trade from Comecon to western markets. Lek has
licensing agreements with several western firms. These include Merck and Eli
Lilly of the US, Fisons of the UK and Knoll of Germany, as well as a
long-standing Bayer-Pharma joint venture with Germany. Most sales to western
markets are generic drugs and bulk products.
The search for new markets and niche products for future growth has been
accompanied by a cost-cutting programme and a 10 per cent drop in the labour
force to 2,100.
Last year this helped Lek remain in the black with an 8 per cent pre-tax
profit on turnover of about Dollars 200m. But times are hard for small
central European pharmaceutical companies such as Lek and Krka, its larger
Slovene competitor. Both face growing domestic competition from western
firms and uncertain prospects for recovery in the once insatiable and
undemanding markets of the socialist east.
To survive, they will need closer links with foreign drug companies. The
forms these take have still to be defined. But once privatisation
legislation is approved, the search for new partners, new products and new
markets will intensify.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (9): Jewel at the hub of
change - Profile of Gorenje
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU have ever eaten dinner in a Slovene home, chances are it was cooked
on a Gorenje stove while the local Riesling came out of a Gorenje
refrigerator.
From its ultra-modern main factory at Velenje, close to the Italian,
Austrian and Hungarian borders, Gorenje has long dominated the domestic
market.
But the 2m Slovenes account for only 5 per cent of the company's total
sales. Gorenje is Slovenia's exporter par excellence, sending 95 per cent of
its output to 70 countries. It sells 60 per cent of appliances under
Gorenje's own brand names, and the remainder under foreign labels, including
General Electric, Bosch, Siemens and Electrolux.
Mr Franjo Bobinac, marketing director, says Gorenje's success stems from its
emphasis on tight quality control and product development. 'The directors of
each division - refrigerators, cookers and washing machines - are
responsible for product quality and development,' he says.
'This year we will produce 23 new appliances - from fridges to stoves.
Gorenje must constantly develop in order to remain one of Europe's top eight
producers.'
But Mr Bobinac admits 1992 was a difficult year. Profits were under severe
pressure, totalling about 1 per cent of the turnover of DM990m, he says.
Like so many Slovene businessmen, he blames the government for failing to
stimulate exports, the bedrock of the Slovene economy.
'Gorenje needs additional export incentives from the government and interest
rates should be lowered to compensate for the strong tolar,' he says.
Mr Bobinac says Gorenje is undergoing changes which will help to streamline
the company and reduce costs. About 1,000 workers have been sent away in the
past three years. Like other exporters, he argues that the average monthly
wage of DM600 is far too high to keep his exports competitive.
In an attempt to cut costs and prices, Gorenje plans to change the
distribution network in major European markets, such as Germany, France and
Austria. 'We will make more direct sales,' says Mr Bobinac.
The break-up of Yugoslavia hit Gorenje - not just in terms of losing
markets. When Slovenia declared independence in 1991, the Yugoslav
republics, especially Serbia, accounted for 30 per cent of all sales.
Although Mr Bobinac says Gorenje had formed its export orientation long
before the disintegration of the Yugoslav federation, the loss of the
Serbian market, the biggest republic in former Yugoslavia, has hurt
especially hard. 'Belgrade alone has almost 2m inhabitants - the size of all
of Slovenia,' he points out.
In addition to losing its captive markets, the disintegration of the federal
state meant that Gorenje lost control of its factories, service outlets and
stores in the other republics. Gorenje now has DM50m in outstanding claims
against Serbia for the seizure of nearly 20 service centres.
Gorenje's production network extended to war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina. The
ongoing Serb siege of Bihac, in north-west Bosnia, has forced it to stop
producing 24-inch refrigerators at Bihac and relocate production to the main
plant in Slovenia. The company does not even know what has happened to the
plant at Tuzla, cut off by both Serb and Croat forces.
Company managers agree that Gorenje's survival hinges on its ability to
generate future export-led growth. 'We are boosting exports to the Middle
East and South America. Sales to Iran, Mexico and Chile are growing
significantly,' Mr Bobinac says.
Gorenje is on the privatisation schedule. But that is likely to occur in a
form which will insure continuing Slovene control of what most Slovenes
regards as a 'national jewel'. Economists believe that most of the shares
will end up with specially-created mutual funds as part of the mass
privatisation programme. Others will be sold or distributed directly to
Gorenje managers and workers, leaving only a minority to be sold on the open
market.
Though foreigners have made inquiries about investing in Gorenje, Mr Bobinac
doubts the government will allow them to buy out Slovenia's main export
companies. 'Gorenje is the only European brand name in Slovenia. I believe
we are too important to become a foreign company.'

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (4): Small beginnings -
The Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Borza, Ljubljana's stock exchange, has steadily expanded since it was
founded three years ago this week.
It is still small. But Mr Boris Snuderl, 33, vice president and chief
operating officer, believes the law on privatisation, passed last November,
should pave the way for future growth.
At present only eight of the 28 securities listed are stocks. The rest are
bonds. Mr Snuderl expects another 200 companies to be listed when
privatisation gets under way later this year.
Market capitalisation in 1992 amounted to DM547m. Annual turnover totalled
DM435. Four listed securites matured in 1992, causing a drop in turnover in
relation to the previous year. Mr Snuderl says daily turnover in recent
weeks has been DM4m to DM5m. To date, the highest one-day trading record was
DM14m.
Daily turnover has increased since January but this is largely because of a
decree which included trades between the 57 members of the stock exchange as
part of turnover.
Mr Snuderl explains that plans to install an electronic trading system will
help to expand the market and raise its efficiency. 'All of our traders have
to travel to Ljubljana twice a week. A screen-based system would make it
easier,' he says.
'There's no way you can cheat the electronic system. Once the trade has been
entered you cannot pretend you bought it later in the day at a higher
price,' he adds.
Mr Snuderl says the Borza's young founders want to build up a fair market.
'We started from nothing. We spent time at the major European and North
American stock exchanges and tried to pick out the best elements.'
As a result, the Borza is a mini-amalgam of the Zurich, Paris and London
stock markets. 'We are close to Zurich because we have direct trading
between the banks. But we are a three-level market like the Paris Bourse. On
the other hand, like the London stock exchange, the Borza is not a state but
a private entity.'
Open for trading on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the Borza, on the sixth floor of
the city centre, is crowded. But it will start to recognise its full
potential only when - and only when - real momentum builds up behind the
privatisation process.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (3): Now the economy has
to adjust - Prospects for lower inflation and higher exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE disruption of economic ties with former Yugoslavia, over 10 times its
size, means that the small, export-oriented economy of Slovenia has been
saddled with a severe adjustment problem.
War-impoverished markets and the loss of cheap inputs from embargo-afflicted
Serbia, coupled with low-wage competition from the former communist central
European economies, have left Slovenia with a cost and, above all, income
structure which is not justified by current levels of productivity and
quality.
Per capita GDP dropped from Dollars 8,658 in 1990, when the statistics were
inflated by the cheap dollar, to Dollars 6,320 in 1991 and Dollars 6,052
last year. This is far below income levels in neigh- bouring Italy and
Austria but much higher than Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, with
which Slovenia now competes for foreign investment and for new markets in
the recession-hit European community.
Incomes have not adjusted to two years of sharply declining GDP, which fell
9.3 per cent in 1991 and 6.5 per cent last year. The drop is due principally
to a 12.4 and 13.2 per cent annual decline in industrial output over this
period, and a steep decline in tourist revenue, the main source of hard
currency income.
Wages and salaries, by contrast, rose around 20 per cent last year,
reflecting the tradition, inherited from the former Yugoslav self-
management system, of awarding pay increases unrelated to productivity.
In the past, this has led to rapid inflation and frequent devaluations. But
the small team of key economic decision makers headed by Mr Mitja Gaspari,
the finance minister, and Mr France Arhar, gover- nor of the Bank of
Slovenja, the central bank, are determined that the new republic should
break out of the old ways.
'Stabilisation must be the main target, to get inflation down to European
levels. Otherwise, there will be no new foreign investment,' Mr Arhar
insists.
The principal burden of adjustment thus far, however, has fallen on the
unemployed as needed structural changes, resulting from privatisation and
reform of the banking system, have not really begun to take effect. The
unemploy- ment rate rose to 11.6 per cent at the end of the year. It is
currently 13 per cent.
Last month's tripartite talks between the government, the unions and
'employers', represented in the Chamber of Economy, eventually agreed a
wages pact designed to keep income growth below the rise in prices. But Mr
Gaspari believes that Slovenia will achieve European-style inflation levels
only when property relationships are clarified.
This requires the quickest possible transformation of companies with
ill-defined 'social capital' into private companies with definite owners and
a clear interest in profitability. Until now, the employers' side has been
represented by managers, not real owners.
Slovenia's privatisation law was approved in November but detailed
regulatory legislation is not expected to be in place before mid-year. Each
enter- prise is responsible for drawing up its own privatisation prop- osal.
These include various forms of management and worker buy-outs, but enter-
prises looking for foreign investment will have to draft their proposals
more conventionally.
The government wants to privatise 400 enterprises this year and nearly 1,600
next year. It is not clear at this stage whether it will be able to achieve
its ambitious target.
In the meantime, it has just drawn up a tight budget which aims to keep the
budget deficit to 1.8 per cent of GDP. This means a deficit of around T21bn,
equivalent to Dollars 200m, in a budget of T291bn (Dollars 2.9bn).
Reaching this target, which is compatible with keeping inflation down to
around 1.6 per cent a month, or 30 per cent on an annual basis, will not be
easy. More than 40 per cent of budget outlays are made up of salaries and
building a new state is an expensive business. The army, for example, needs
re-equip- ping to patrol and defend the new border with former Yugo- slavia.
Rising unemployment increases the demand for social safety net spending.
Independent economists, such as Mr Joze Mencinger of the Ljubljana
University law faculty, believe the economy is bottoming out and should
stabilise or show small growth this year, provided the recession in western
markets does not affect exports and tourism receipts too adversely.
Last year saw a 3 per cent decline in imports, mainly inputs from former
Yugoslavia, and an 8 per cent rise in hard currency exports, reflecting a
modestly successful shift into EC and Efta markets. The result was a Dollars
161m surplus on the country's Dollars 11bn foreign trade following a Dollars
257m deficit in 1991, according to the central bank.
A modest trade surplus and a rebound in foreign tourist receipts after the
collapse in 1991 contributed to a current account surplus of Dollars 764m
last year, compared with Dollars 190m in 1991. Both helped push foreign
exchange reserves sharply higher to Dollars 1.2bn from Dollars 365m at the
end of 1991.
Exporters, squeezed by rising domestic costs and last year's effective 18
per cent revalu- ation of the Slovene tolar, complain bitterly that govern-
ment policy is squeezing mar- gins to the bone and discour- aging an
export-led recovery.
The government remains deaf to their pleas, determined as it is to force
enterprises to cut their cost base and become more productive. 'Accum-
ulating foreign reserves is tantamount to exporting capital. But it brings
in a return of 8 per cent, and until structural reforms bite there are few
ways of earning that kind of return on domestic investment,' adds Mr
Mencinger, a forceful advocate of floating the tolar and one of the
architects of economic policy in the first post- independence government.
Looking ahead, the prospects look brighter. Slovenia sur- vived a short but
violent indep- endence war with an economy which has proved largely
self-contained and with a good infrastructure, including a nuclear power
station at Krsko and its own port at Koper on the Adriatic coast.
The new republic has man- aged to create a strong, virtually convertible
currency backed by strong reserves and a low foreign debt of Dollars 1.74bn.
It has become a member of the main international financial institutions and
laid down the legislative framework for privatisation, banking and other
reforms. It now remains to build on this solid base and move ahead rapidly
with the privatisation programme designed to provide the flexibility needed
to reduce costs and develop new markets.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (5): Bond-for-debt swap -
Banking reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE essence of the former Yugoslav self-management system was an incestuous
relationship between credit- hungry enterprises and the captive banks which
they ambiguously 'owned'. The legacy, in Slovenia and throughout former
Yugoslavia, can be seen in debt-strapped enterprises and bank balance sheets
stuffed with non- performing assets, write Anthony Robinson and Laura
Silber.
The Slovenian banks were widely perceived as the most professional and
competent in the former federation. But they shared many of the basic
weaknesses of the old system and their post-independence performance remains
distorted by bad debt and the effective confiscation of hard currency
deposits transferred to the former Yugoslav central bank, the National Bank
of Yugo- slavia (NBY).
On January 27, however, the Slovene parliament passed a law which opened the
way for banking reform by providing a state guarantee for special bonds to
finance the restruc- turing of banks and savings institutions.
Reform starts from the assumption that eliminating the financial
consequences of the previous system is a long-term project which will have
to be financed by the Slovene taxpayer. The method chosen is through the
issue of DM3.5bn, 30-year government guaranteed bonds with an 8 per cent
coupon, payable quarterly.
The bonds will be swapped for specific portions of the bad debt held by
commercial banks. The coupon payments will show up on bank income
statements, replacing what until now have been accumulated losses.
The first bond-for-debt swap has been earmarked for Ljubljanska Banka (LjB),
by far the largest of the 31 local and two foreign banks operating in the
country. LjB accounts for around 50 per cent of the assets and liabilities
in the Slovene banking system and handles around 70 per cent of foreign
financial activities. When its 13 'daughter banks' are included, the LjB
group accounts for 75 to 78 per cent of total Slovene assets and deposits.
Reducing the hitherto preponderant share of LjB is one of the main objects
of bank reform. 'In future, we would like to see the emergence of four or
five banks of roughly equal size as the basis of a competitive banking
system,' says Mr Mitja Gaspari, the finance minister.
The process has already begun with the hiving of SKB bank from the LjB group
three years ago and the emergence of other former LjB daughter banks, such
as Mariborska Banka, as potential core banks in the new system.
The task of restructuring the LjB group has been given to Mr Marko Voljc, an
experienced international banker. Mr Voljc, a 45-year-old polyglot, is a
development banker who returned to Slovenia in September after 13 years at
the World Bank. He was appointed as the bank's new chairman and chief
executive on the same day as the new bank guarantee law specifically singled
out Ljubljanska as the key to reform of the banking system. Mr Voljc spent
three years as the World Bank representative in Mexico before returning to
Washington in 1990 as head of the Central America and Panama division.
For LjB, which is now 100 per cent state-owned, bad debt is less of a
problem than those caused by the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the
financial irresponsibility of the Serbian authorities in particular.
The NBY in Belgrade currently holds around DM450m of frozen Slovene hard
currency funds and a further DM850m deposited in the LjB's Croatian
subsidiary which were also frozen, and in effect spent, by Belgrade. The LjB
in turn is seeking compensation from Zagreb for the seizure of its Croatian
subsidiary.
Mr Voljc calculates that two-thirds of the bank's non-performing debt is
represented by frozen foreign currency accounts, and only one third by the
bad debt of Slovene and other former Yugoslav enterprises. This is
significant because the Slovene state will refinance only the bad debts of
Slovene enter- prises through the new bonds.
In the meantime, the bank is methodically converting blocked hard currency
accounts into new, convertible hard currency accounts. Most of the 33,000
such accounts were small, individual accounts and over 90 per cent of the
small accounts up to DM3,500 have already been converted or are being
converted at the rate of DM500 a month.
'In some ways, the problems are more difficult now than a year ago. But we
now have a new government with a four- year mandate and we are starting to
concentrate on economic reform rather than political battles. The legal
framework is in place and the government has the time horizon required for
banking reform to work,' Mr Voljc says.
What is more, Slovenia is no longer alone. The World Bank, limited in its
assistance because of Slovenia's relatively high income, has earmarked
Dollars 150m to help bank reform and Slovenia has become a full member of
the IMF, the European Bank for Recons- truction and Development and other
institutions. Closer ties are also being forged with neighbouring Austrian
and Italian banks in particular.
On balance, however, the Slovene authorities would prefer foreign banks to
enter into joint ventures or take minority shareholdings in Slovene banks
rather than set up wholly-owned subsidiaries. Banking, together with
tourism, is precisely the kind of clean, high value added service industry
on which Slovenia hopes to base the transformation of its economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
it has a clean balance sheet.
Founded in 1965 as a subsidiary of Ljubljanska Banka, SKB was responsible
for housing and municipal construction loans. Under the banking reform law
of the former Yugoslav federation, SKB - then known as
Stanovanjsko-Komunalna Banka - broke away from Ljubljanska in January 1990
to become a joint stock company.
Some 700 Slovene companies and institutions, including the city of
Ljubljana, now own shares in SKB. The original shares were withdrawn in 1992
and reissued.
They are now denominated in Ecus, with 30 per cent preferred and the
remainder as regular shares. The second biggest Slovene bank, SKB is now the
only bank whose shares are quoted on the Borza, the Ljubljana stock
exchange.
Mrs Cvetka Selsek, deputy general manager, believes privatisation of SKB has
compelled management and employees to work harder and more efficiently.
'They want to do as good a job as possible to keep up the value of the
shares,' she says.
Retail, corporate and trade finance, together with international banking
comprise SKB's main operations. Its acquisition of a bankrupt subsidiary of
Beogradska Banka, the Belgrade-based bank, has provided it with an extensive
branch network.
While SKB has largely managed to avoid the pitfalls of the other Slovene
banks, Mrs Selsek worries about 1993 when the process of banking
rehabilitation begins in earnest. 'If this will be the most difficult year
I'd be happy. We are all eagerly waiting for the process to be behind us.'
she says.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (1): The Balkans' lucky
ones - Though the country has suffered economically from the disintegration
of Yugoslavia and the war in the Balkans, independence has given its 2m
inhabitants the opportunity to build an open market economy and democratic
institutions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SLOVENES always had at least as much in common with their Alpine neighbours
as with their Balkan partners in the former Yugoslavia. Since Slovenia's
declaration of independence in June 1991, the gap between the peaceful,
ethnically homogeneous new republic of 2m people and the war-impoverished
rest of former Yugoslavia has widened inexorably.
'We have been very lucky,' says President Milan Kucan, the wily former
communist who led Slovenia's drive for independence from the Serb- dominated
federation. But he, like Mr Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister of Slovenia's
three-pronged coalition government, makes clear that Slovenia suffers
economically from the disintegration of Yugoslavia and would be one of the
principal gainers from a resolution of the bloody Balkan imbroglio.
'Slovenia's southern border with Croatia has become the border between peace
and war in Europe,' Mr Kucan declares.
A glance at the map shows what he means. At its narrowest point, only a 46
km- long strip of Slovenian coast- line separates Italy from the rest of
former Yugoslavia. Austria is insulated from the war-torn regions of Croatia
and Bosnia-Herzegovina, both once ruled by the Austrian Habs- burgs, thanks
to its own 324 km-long border with Slovenia.
But Slovenia would hate to be perceived merely as a convenient cordon
sanitaire. The new Karavanke road tunnel beneath the Alps, completed just
before the 10-day war between Slovenia and the Yugoslav army which
immediately followed indep- endence, has underlined Slovenia's traditional
importance as a transit route.
The railways and the motorway leading south through the capital Ljubljana to
the Slovenian port of Koper and its Italian neighbour Trieste carry freight
and travellers heading to and from central Europe and the Adriatic sea. The
highway is also thick with aid trucks and an ever-decreasing volume of
'normal' cargoes moving south-east towards Croatia.
Independence has, above all, brought peace to Slovenia and left it free to
implement the kind of rational market reforms and privatisation policies
which remain blocked in the republics absorbed and impoverished by war
further south.
Economists, however, are quick to point out that independence has its costs.
Slovenia, with its self- contained infrastructure and proximity to western
markets, was always by far the richest republic of the former federation.
Its per capita GDP of around Dollars 6,000 was three times higher than that
of Serbia and five times that of Kosovo, the poorest region of the former
Yugoslavia.
Slovenia has always had a strong tourism industry of its own. But it also
benefited from the overnight stays of foreign tourists heading further south
to Croatia's Dalmatian coast. Now the once-thriving seaside hotels are
filled with discons- olate refugees and Croatia's main source of hard
currency income has disappeared. So have the transit tourists through
Slovenia.
Above all, Slovene enterprises were able to build up exports to the rest of
Europe, thanks to the volume of sales they were able to make in Yugoslavia
which virtually gave them a 22m strong domestic market.
The UN embargo on trade with Serbia means both the loss of the largest of
the former Yugoslav markets and an end to cheap Serbian raw materials and
other inputs. These helped restrain costs and improve competitiveness in
more demanding hard currency markets. Now Slovenia has to lower real wages
and increase productivity in order to compensate.
On the positive side of the balance sheet, however, the end of the federal
state means that Slovenia no longer has to contribute over Dollars 1bn a
year to finance the bloated Yugoslav army or see its hard currency deposits
'frozen' by the National Bank of Yugoslavia, as happened before
independence.
Relations with Croatia, Slovenia's southern neighbour, are generally good
but they are complicated by three contentious issues.
The first of these is the border itself, which is disputed in parts. The
second issue contains Croatia's share of the running costs of the Krsko
nuclear plant on Slovenian territory. The plant was built and financed
jointly to supply electricity to both republics but financially hard-pressed
Croatia is now reluctant to pay its share of the running costs. The third
outstanding issue concerns compensation for the assets of Ljubljanska Banka
in Croatia.
There is no nostalgia for the old Yugoslavia, which Slovenes tried without
success to trans- form into a looser confederal structure. But a mixture of
compassion for the suffering of their fellow southern Slavs and economic
loss ensures that the Slovene authorities, while categorically ruling out
any possibility of resuming old political ties with former Yugoslavia, pray,
without much hope, for a quick and lasting solution to the conflict and the
resumption of normal economic ties.
The war, with its violent and deliberate displacement of millions of people,
has and is taking place in the ethnically mixed border lands of Croatia and
Bosnia relatively distant from the Slovene border. Both Mr Kucan and Mr
Drnovsek, who headed the old revolving Yugoslav state presidency for a year
before negotiating the exodus of the federal army from Slovenia in July
1991, criticise the failure of the west to intervene more forcibly to stop
at an early stage what Mr Kucan calls 'the war of aggression waged by
Serbia.'
The president is particularly scathing against what he calls the west's
definition of the war in Bosnia as a civil or ethnic war. 'Of course the
people who are dying do not care how it is defined. But for the inter-
national community it is essential to define it as a war of aggression
against a UN- recognised state and draw the appropriate conclusions. It is a
tragedy that Bosnia's elected leader has now been reduced by the
international com- munity to merely one of sev- eral ethnic leaders,' he
adds.
Preventing the war in parts of former Yugoslavia destabilising Slovenia and
scaring off tourists remains a top priority for the new republic.
The border with Croatia is now in effect sealed against further immigation
after 70,000 refugees, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of the local population,
were taken in. Refugees are housed and cared for by local authorities around
the country, often in former Yugoslav army barracks, at an annual cost of
around Dollars 250m. Many are expected to stay even after the war ends.
Meanwhile, the coalition government which emerged from last December's
elections to the national parliament and parallel presidential elections, is
determined to use its four-year mandate to complete the transformation of
the country into a fully-fledged, market-orientated, multi-party
parliamentary democracy.
At the core of the government is an alliance between the Liberal Democrats,
headed by Mr Drnovsek, which emerged as the largest single party with 25 per
cent of seats in parliament, and the Christian Democrats led by Mr Lojze
Peterle, the foreign minister. But the coalition also includes the four
party 'associated list', made up principally of reformed communists. This
helps to give the coalition a wider parliamentary base.
The inclusion of the 'left- wing' parties, with their traditional links to
workers and the trade unions showed its value last month when they twice
gave their assent to a new wages pact designed to reduce real incomes.
Independent economists calculate that average real incomes have to fall
around 10 per cent from current levels of around DM650 a month if the
Slovenian economy is to compete effectively for new markets in the west and
attract foreign investment. Both are needed to reverse the rise in
unemployment and build on the structural reforms to the banking system and
privatisation which are currently under way.
The next four years will be crucial. But much has been achieved in the first
20 months of independence - including the establishment of a parliamentary
democracy and a virtually convertible independent currency, the Slovene
tolar, backed by strong reserves. The new republic is peaceful,
internationally recognised and a member of the most important inter-
national institutions. By the end of the century it wants to be eligible for
full membership of an enlarged European Community.
As elsewhere in the region, privatisation and other structural reforms are
seen as laying the basis for the development of a self-confident middle
class capable of ensuring that the democratic and economic reforms under way
in Slovenia become irreversible.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New rubber pact rejected by EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community has said that it is unwilling to renegotiate a new
International Natural Rubber Agreement (Inra) in what appears to be a head
on clash between rubber producer and consumer countries, .
The present Inra is the second since pricing mechanisms for the natural
rubber trade were set by producer and consumer countries in the late 1970s.
It expires at the end of this year.
Producers, upset by continued low prices, want consumer countries to
negotiate a new pact. They set the end of March as a deadline for consuming
countries to declare their willingness to negotiate a new agreement.
A statement yesterday from the European Commission in Brussels said that the
EC saw no alternative but to vote against renegotiation of Inra.
It accused the rubber producing countries of failing to abide by price
review provisions laid down in the existing pact.
It is not known what decisions on Inra have been taken by other big consumer
countries, in particular the US and Japan. In the past the US has been
unwilling to agree to any renegotiation of Inra.
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia account for nearly 80 per cent of world
natural rubber production.
They - along with Sri Lanka and the Ivory Coast - are the producers involved
in the Inra pact.
Earlier this year the Inra producers warned that if the consumers did not
agree to renegotiate the organisation would collapse. Producers would then
be forced to bring in their own pricing mechanisms.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Salesmen
can still give value for money - Provision of expert advice is a way for
representatives to win friends and business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE always had some sympathy with the farmer who erected the sign at his
gate saying: 'We shoot every third salesman. The second has just left.'
It was, of course, a humorous way of informing representatives passing by
that the farmer had no wish to talk to casual callers who would merely waste
his valuable time. It implied that there was no chance of a stranger
drumming up new business because committed relationships with existing
suppliers were already in place.
Another sign which can still be seen on many farm gates reads:
'Representatives by appointment only'. In practice, these days not many try
the cold call approach. Their more professional attitude is without doubt
one of the results of the decline in farm profitability and, with it, harder
times for those who supply the industry's requisites. There are far fewer
people trying to sell to the farming industry than there were. Each of them
has to plan his or her activities more carefully.
It has been estimated that there are 9,000-10,000 agricultural
representatives on the road at present - about half the number 20 years ago
and one-third of those 30 years ago. Nevertheless, their cost to the
industry, including pensions and cars, is put at Pounds 350m a year. One way
or another, this ultimately has to come out of farmers' pockets.
Not all salesmen are a drain on agriculture. The best and most successful
have always helped and advised their clients. Moreover, if a person trying
to sell animal feed were unable to give sound nutritional advice, or an
agricultural chemical representative could not recognise weeds and plant
diseases before recommending products to deal with them effectively, they
would make few sales. A salesman must add value as well as shift product.
There is, however, no widely recognised assessment of competence nor a
generally accepted training procedure. Achievements are normally measured
only by the quantity of sales made which, on the face of it, is the most
important measurement of performance in the short term.
Those salesmen who are particularly successful can usually only progress
through their company's hierarchy and salary scale by leaving the job they
are probably best at and going into management. All too often companies lose
a good salesmen and gain a mediocre manager.
With 350 salespeople on the road, Dalgety, the UK's biggest independent
supplier of the complete range of farmers' requirements, is more aware than
most companies of the inadequacies of traditional management and motivation
of sales forces. It has, therefore, decided to develop its own training and
certification scheme for salespeople.
To increase the value and significance of the scheme Dalgety approached
Oxford Assessment, an independent department of the University of Oxford, to
help produce appropriate training and appraisal procedures for each sector
of their business.
Dalgety and Oxford Assessment believe that this is the first UK agricultural
supply company to develop standards for its sales force and have them
independently evaluated.
Fifty Dalgety representatives are so far reported to have embarked on the
scheme, encouraged no doubt by the promise of higher salaries and bigger
perks on successful completion. But the benefits do not stop there,
according to Mr Don Phillips, the company's sales and marketing director,
He claims that his salespeople are showing signs of greater job satisfaction
because their competence is being recognised by factors other than just
sales turnover. He is convinced this will lead to better penetration of the
market and bigger sales for Dalgety - both of which he regards as are vital
to his company's future prosperity.
Mr Phillips predicts that British agriculture will soon be unable to support
even the present depleted number of salesmen serving it and that half the
jobs which exist today will disappear over the next few years.
Free advice for farmers is becoming a rarity as even the government's
previously complementary advisory service goes commercial and the Dalgety
initiative is therefore timely. Many farmers are having to do an increasing
amount of the physical work on their holdings themselves, often
single-handedly, and simply do not have the time or the energy to keep fully
up to date with the mass of EC regulations and new technical information
affecting their livelihood.
Any salesman who can short circuit and interpret some of the paperwork
helping his customers to stay the right side of both the law and the subsidy
maze of the Common Agriculture Policy, while producing better crops or
livestock will be welcome on many farms. Supplies purchased from the same
salesmen will cost a little extra. But I would be surprised if other supply
companies did not think it worthwhile to follow Dalgety's lead.
As farmers' lives become steadily more complicated and specialised knowledge
becomes more vital, as other sources of information dry up, many farmers are
looking for expert advice.
The fact that help from a supplier may not always be entirely independent
will be overlooked if the quality of the counsel is basically sound. Even
farmers know there is no such thing as a free lunch.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mines give way to condominiums
 -Why one Malaysia's tin industry has been in steep decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE outskirts of Kuala Lumpur a condominium project called 'The Mines' is
nearing completion.
The site was once one of the area's biggest tin mines. Malaysia's tin mining
industry - once a vital part of the economy - is rapidly disappearing. These
days mine owners find real estate development far more lucrative.
Last year Malaysia's production of tin-in-concentrates was 14,339 tonnes,
down from 20,710 tonnes a year earlier. The 1992 production figure was well
below the figure earlier estimated by the Ministry of Finance (18,000
tonnes), indicating that the decline of the industry has been a good deal
faster than expected.
Rising production costs and the depletion of high grade tin reserves have
contributed to the fall-off in production. But low prices on the
international market are the key factor.
In 1981 Malaysia was earning between between MDollars 32 (USDollars 12) and
MDollars 34 per kg for its tin on the international market. Prices now seem
stubbornly stuck round the MDollars 14 mark. Malaysia's average production
costs are estimated at MDollars 16 per kg.
Mr Hew See Tong, president of the All Malaya Chinese Mining Association,
says production is likely to fall further. 'The industry is doomed if
current prices and demand continue. Many miners will not be able to sustain
operations.'
Malaysia's economy grew by more than 8 per cent in each of the last five
years. Labour shortages and consequent rising wages are forcing more and
more mines to close. In 1990 there were 141 tin mines in Malaysia. Now there
are less than half that number.
Tin mining has been going on in one form or another in Malaysia for
centuries. Until recently, the country was the world's premier producer. In
the mid-19th century large tracts of land were given over to tin
concessions. Chinese immigrants flooded in to work the mines. By 1900,
Malaya - as it was then - was producing 50,000 tonnes of tin each year, more
than half the world's output.
In the 1960s annual production was up to between 60,000 and 70,000 tonnes.
In 1913 there were 200,000 employed in the tin industry. In 1980 the number
had declined to 39,000. Now only about 4,000 work in the tin mines.
The critical year for the worldwide tin industry was 1985 when the
international tin council's buffer stock operations collapsed and more than
100,000 tonnes of stockpiled tin was released on to the market. Prices went
through the floor and tin mining operations round the world  - particularly
those involved in high cost hard rock mining - were forced to close down.
Some low labour cost countries - notably Brazil, China and Indonesia -
encouraged by the high pre-1985 prices, had raised output. All three are now
bigger producers than Malaysia.
Quotas on tin exports introduced by the Association of Tin Producing
Countries (ATPC), do not seem to have had much effect on international
pricing. The ATPC links Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria,
Thailand and Zaire, countries which together account for about 60 per cent
of world production. But Brazil and China are not members.
Hopes for a tin market revival in 1992 proved to be ill-founded. Prices in
Kuala Lumpur did rise in mid year to the MDollars 18 per kg mark. But
Malaysia's miners - who saw more lucrative investment opportunities in other
sectors of the economy - did not rush to re-open mines. Their caution was
justified. The price quickly dropped back to under MDollars 13 per kg by the
end of the year.
Increased tin sales by China was one cause for the price decline. There was
also nervousness about plans by the US Defence Logistics Agency (DLA) to
sell some of its substantial tin stockpile.
Malaysia's problems were further compounded by the strengthening of the
Malaysian dollar against the US currency which caused local tin prices to be
at a premium compared to the price on the London Metal Exchange. In
consequence, foreign buyers tended to stay away from Kuala Lumpur.
There are some brave miners who are determined to carry on one of Malaysia's
oldest industries. One of the country's most extensive mines, Sungei Lembing
in Pahang on peninsula Malaysia's east coast, has been reopened.
But many others have turned their backs on the industry. The Berjuntai
company, once Malaysia's biggest tin mining operator, is now planning to
diversify into brick manufacturing.
Meanwhile miners watch their industry disappear - with mining sites turned
into condominiums for Malaysia's newly affluent.

approach
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEARCH by the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) for a white knight to
help shore up its flagging business has taken a new turn. It is now ready to
entertain all offers in what appears to be a tactic aimed at forcing the
Chicago Board of Trade to sweeten its takeover bid.
Executives of the CBOT, the world's largest futures exchange, and the Comex,
the largest US metals market, surprised everyone, including most of their
members, when they announced merger plans in January.
Since then, negotiations have taken a sour turn with some Comex members
seeking to oust Ms Donna Redel, their chairman, the plan's main proponent.
Comex negotiators are frustrated by the CBOT's staunch refusal to allow
Comex members access to the CBOT's popular grain and financial contracts.
The CBOT has proposed buying out the metals exchange with the future stream
of Comex profits - an essentially riskless transaction - and keeping the two
exchanges' product lines and memberships distinct.
Last week the committee hammering out the details of the plan waived its
exclusivity clause, allowing Comex to address other offers.
At nearly the same time, the embattled Ms Redel stepped down as chief
negotiator of the CBOT-Comex deal, while retaining her duties as the
exchange's chairman.
The move may diffuse membership dissent against Ms Redel, while allowing her
to step back from the CBOT alliance to weigh other offers.

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development is organising an
Dollars 8m study for the rehabilitation of Russia's gas pipeline network to
cut back on waste equivalent to Belgium's annual gas consumption.
Dr Mark Tomlinson, responsible for energy policy, said the study on
combatting leakages and low pressure accounting for the loss of 15 per cent
of Russia's gas output would be followed by the awarding of contracts to fix
the problems.
EBRD's board has already approved five loans in the oil and gas sector
amounting to a total of Ecus352.8m (Dollars 419m), and is mobilising an
additional Ecus647.8m in western private sector funds. But the money has yet
to be disbursed.
Guarantees have yet to be worked out with the Russian authorities. In
addition there has been the problem of the the World Bank's 'negative
pledge' requirement not allowing Russia to pledge resources as collateral to
any institution except itself.
Saying rapid action was necessary to support Russian reformers, Mr Jacques
Attali, EBRD's president, told a news conference in Moscow that he hoped the
negative pledge question would be sorted out with the World Bank in the next
few weeks.
Mr Ron Freeman, the bank's first vice-president, said there were also
outstanding problems over Russia's legal and tax regimes which needed to be
sorted out to attract foreign investment.
He said that Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for economics and
finance, was talking to western oil companies in Moscow in order to try and
remove those obstacles to reviving the sector.
The five loans include a project with Conoco in Russia's constituent Komi
republic, and another with the US oil company Anderson and Japan's Itochu.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG accuses CRA mining group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Kevin Brown in Sydney
PAPUA NEW GUINEA (PNG) yesterday accused CRA, the Australian mining group,
of acting provocatively by withdrawing staff from its Mount Kare alluvial
gold mine in the isolated highlands area.
CRA, a 49 per cent subsidiary of RTZ of the UK, evacuated its 15 remaining
staff from the mine on Sunday, claiming that threats of violence had been
made by armed local landowners.
Operations were suspended last month for the third time since production
began in 1990. CRA says the mine has been attacked three times by
landowners, some armed with rifles and shotguns.
However, Mr Masket Iangalio, mining minister, said the withdrawal followed a
dispute over an outstanding debt between CRA and the receiver manager of the
landowners' company, Kare-Puga Development Corporation (KDC).
'I have been advised that no landowners have entered the (mine) campsite and
no property has been damaged, and that law and order is being maintained,'
Mr Iangalio said in a statement released in Port Moresby.

London's robusta COFFEE fell steadily in the morning after opening down as
expected against New York, which fell steeply on Friday.
When the New York market again found the going sticky on its opening
yesterday, London's May contract briefly tested a new recent low at Dollars
870 a tonne before retrieving Dollars 872 per tonne - its bottom of two
weeks ago. There was some confusion over the likely impact of any failure of
the ICO talks on a new international coffee pact, due to finish tomorrow, to
reach agreement.
Base metals edged away from earlier lows during afternoon LME trading,
although prices mostly closed lower, reflecting overall depressed sentiment.
Dealers said three-month COPPER continued to hold just above Dollars 2,160 a
tonne, but was loth to push much higher, following Friday's technical
breakdown.
News that mining sources in Zaire expect the country's 1993 copper output to
fall to 80,000 tonnes, compared with Gecamines earlier forecasts of 150,000
tonnes, had little impact as European traders are used to irregular supplies
from Zaire.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: French notes rally as franc gains ground
on D-Mark
</HEADLINE>

FRENCH government bonds rallied as the franc strengthened against the D-Mark
yesterday in the wake of the expected centre-right election victory.
Dealers said French bonds took encouragement as the franc strengthened to
FFr3.3950 to the D-Mark, compared with FFr3.4050 before the weekend, and as
short-term interest rates edged lower.
The yield on the 7.5 per cent bond due 1995 moved to 7.23 per cent from its
opening of 7.36 per cent. The rally was less marked at the long end, but the
10-year bond closed higher with the yield of 7.30 per cent, compared with an
opening level of 7.32 per
cent.
One dealer noted strong buying interest later in the day on rumours that the
franc may be allowed to float, which would pave the way for lower interest
rates. The Matif futures contract gained 0.16 to end at 17.42 in relatively
light volume.
ITALIAN government bonds tumbled yesterday in response to news at the
weekend that some senior Christian Democrats, including former prime
minister Giulio Andreotti, may be investigated over alleged links with the
Mafia.
The lira's weakness against the D-Mark also depressed the bond market, and
dealers reported heavy selling by foreigners. The BTP futures contract fell
from Friday's close of 95.96 to 95.14.
THE Bank of Spain's decision yesterday afternoon to cut its overnight rate
from 14.75 per cent to 14.25 per cent added further momentum to the Spanish
government bond market.
Dealers said the market was already in bullish mood, helped by the French
election result and the strength of the French franc. The yield on the
10-year benchmark fell from 11.50 per cent to 11.37 per cent.
UK government bonds closed mixed, with the short end buoyed up by hopes of a
base rate cut, while longer-dated issues slipped back ahead of tomorrow's
Pounds 3bn gilt auction.
Abbey National said yesterday it may be forced to raise its mortgage rate in
order to be able to offer more attractive rates to savers. Dealers said
Abbey National's threat led to speculation in the market that the government
may cut its base rate in order to avert the risk of higher mortgage rates.
AFTER last week's big losses, US Treasury prices posted solid gains across
the board yesterday, despite some early weakness on overseas markets.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up at 102 31/32 ,
yielding 6.886 per cent. At the short end of the market prices were also
firmer, with the two-year note up  1/8 at 99 27/32 , to yield 3.941 per
cent.
Trading in New York opened against a pessimistic background. Investors and
dealers continued to speculate that this year's remarkable bond market rally
 -which pushed long-term yields down to 6.7 per cent, may be over because of
rising inflation. Moreover, there was considerable overnight selling in
Tokyo, although that was seen primarily as a delayed reaction to last
Friday's declines.
Despite the gloomy backdrop, prices picked up ground from the start, amid
talk that the Federal Reserve would once again step into the market and
purchase coupon-bearing Treasuries outright. Dealers said that
short-covering also contributed to the gains, with prices putting on a
strong spurt in late afternoon.
The day's economic news - a 4.6 per cent rise in new home sales, a 0.2 per
cent rise in personal income, and a 0.6 per cent rise in personal spending
(all from February) - was mostly ignored by the market, although the
weaker-than-expected income number was said to have spurred some of the late
buying.
This was mainly because the news was old, and attention was fixed on the
more important economic statistic out this week - the March employment
report, which will be published on Friday. Yesterday, investors were
cautiously optimistic that it will not prove a repeat of February's
unexpectedly strong jobs report, which showed a 365,000 increase in non-farm
payrolls.
JAPANESE government bond futures suffered a sharp fall yesterday, prompted
by a strong stock market rally.
The Nikkei stock index topped 19,000 and closed at 19,048.38, its highest
level in the current fiscal year and 259.68 points above its Friday close.
Dealers said the recovery in the stock market - which has gained over 13 per
cent since March 8 - wiped out hopes of any further easing in interest
rates.
'People see the stock market rally as a sign that there is a switching of
assets, out of bonds and into equities,' said one dealer, although he added
that most investors were likely to hold on to their cash bond holdings until
the new fiscal year starts on April 1.
The futures contract opened at 108.60, reaching a high of 108.78 early in
the trading session, before heavy selling pressure pushed the price down to
a low of 107.93, the closing price.
The fall in cash bond prices was less marked. The yield on the benchmark No
145 issue moved from 4.215 per cent at the opening to end the day at 4.28
per cent.
The ministry of finance is expected to auction the April issue of 10-year
government bonds this week and dealers said the coupon may rise for the
first time in almost a year.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Scandinavian banks set to
securitise mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL Scandinavian banks are preparing to securitise their mortgage
portfolios, allowing them to ease some of the financial pressure they are
under and to raise fresh funds.
Scandinavian banks have been hit by losses in the property and commercial
loans sector as a result of severe recession and poor credit analysis, and
their credit ratings have suffered as a result.
Postipankki, the Finnish bank, is planning a Dollars 500m issue of
mortgage-backed securities, arranged by Merrill Lynch.
The offering will be filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,
allowing the deal to be placed in the US domestic market, where the
well-developed mortgage-backed market can offer finer pricing than in
Europe. The deal will either be structured as a US offering or as a global
offering.
The deal will be made up of at least five tranches, the largest with a
maturity of only one year, aimed at US money market funds.
In addition, Union Bank of Finland has mandated Morgan Stanley to arrange a
mortgage-backed issue later in the year. Spintab, the Swedish mortgage
institution, is also said to be planning a mortgage-backed issue via Nomura.
Dealers said that conditions were ripe for a wave of securitisation by
Scandinavian banks. However, the logistical problems involved in setting up
such deals means that a sudden rush of deals is unlikely.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: SKF long-term debt downgraded
by Standard &amp; Poor's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, yesterday had its
long-term debt downgraded to BBB from BBB plus by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
rating agency.
S&amp;P said the decision was based on the Swedish company's weak 1992 financial
performance, its rising debt and increasingly difficult industry conditions.
SKF's loss after financial items rose to SKr1.8bn (Dollars 233m) in 1992
from SKr221m a year earlier, while net debt rose to SKr6.7bn from SKr5.6bn.
Low industry demand and price pressures mean the debt will only be reduced
slowly, according to S&amp;P. Demand in Europe, which accounts for more than 60
per cent of group sales, is expected to be particularly weak this year.
'With few signs of a recovery in the fortunes of SKF's main customers, the
automotive and engineering industries, SKF could face its fourth consecutive
year of declining demand,' S&amp;P warned.
It noted the group's strong industry position and its rationalisation
programmes, but stated that 'prolonged industry difficulties could weaken
demand beyond expectations and lead to reduced credit quality.'
S&amp;P also lowered its rating on the US dollar-denominated Euro-commercial
paper programme of Neste Oy, the Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals
group.
The cut to A-2 from A-1 reflected 'a material deterioration of the group's
financial position due to the difficult trading positions in all its key
businesses and the continuing high level of capital investment in the last
couple of years,' said S&amp;P.
The agency noted the Finnish government's capacity to help state-owned
companies had been constrained by sharply higher public sector borrowing.
Neste has been identified as a privatisation candidate by the government.
The group's business position in the Nordic region is strong, according to
S&amp;P, particularly in Finland where it is the only oil refiner.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Bonds: TCV's ADollars 500 offering provides
focus as activity subsides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market subsided yesterday as the end of the
Japanese fiscal year on March 31 kept many Japanese investors out of the
market.
The pace of issuance is expected to increase later in the week, although a
heavy calendar of economic data and Thursday's Bundesbank meeting are
expected to cap activity. Generally, the level of activity in the second
quarter is not expected to reach record first-quarter issuance.
The main focus of the day was an ADollars 500m offering for Treasury Corp of
Victoria, the largest in the sector to date. The deal was described as
global by lead-manager Merrill Lynch, although there is no initial placement
in Australia.
The structure of the issue of 10 1/2 year bonds, due to be priced today, ran
into some criticism from competitors. While they accepted that Merrill had
found demand among US investors, European dealers said that there was little
interest in the deal among European investors.
Firstly, the fact that the bonds are registered is a severe deterrent for
many European investors in the Australian dollar market, many of whom are
retail investors and buy only bearer bonds. In addition, the pricing
appeared aggressive to European investors, since the issue is likely to
yield 10 basis points less than TCV's recent 10-year Eurobond.
In addition, the decision to price the deal at 12 basis points below the
yield of the borrower's 10-year debt in the domestic Australian dollar
market provoked concern. Dealers were worried that at the time of the
pricing, on Tuesday afternoon European time, there would be no active
trading in the benchmark.
A government bond would have provided a better benchmark, they argued. The
margin over the comparable government bond is about 60 basis points.
However, Merrill said that there was strong demand for the paper in the US
and in eastern Asia. US investors, in particular, are taking a positive view
on the currency.
Dealers said US investors had been showing some interest in 'exchangeable'
New South Wales and Queensland bonds, which can be sold into the Australian
market.
The Philippines plans to offer another Eurobond issue to tap the capital
market to fund its development projects, according to Mr Ramon del Rosario,
finance secretary, Reuter reports from Manila.
Mr del Rosario said in an interview published by the Manila Chronicle
newspaper, that Manila had given assurances to the International Monetary
Fund that 'we will not go crazy in our buying spree' in the international
credit markets. It will be the country's second offering after the
successful launch earlier this month of a Dollars 150m Eurobond issue in
London.

<TEXT>
TWO of Singapore's biggest banks, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) and
United Overseas Bank (UOB), have reported strong profits, reflecting
improved domestic growth and general economic buoyancy in the south-east
Asia region.
OCBC, Singapore's second-biggest company in terms of market capitalisation
after Singapore Airlines, reported net profits of SDollars 295.46m
(USDollars 180.2m) in the year to December 31 1992, a 16 per cent rise over
the SDollars 255.8m profits achieved in 1991.
OCBC's banking net earnings increased by more than 17 per cent to SDollars
197.4m. Total income for the OCBC group fell slightly, to SDollars 2.29bn
from SDollars 2.41bn.
Net interest income for the group rose more than 15 per cent to SDollars
555.4m, from SDollars 480m. Loans and advances for the group rose 12.8 per
cent to SDollars 16.1bn, from SDollars 14.2bn. For the banking activities,
loans and advances went up more than 13 per cent toSDollars 12.8bn.
OCBC said earnings per share in 1992 were 44 Singapore cents, compared with
38 cents in 1991.
The bank will pay a final dividend of 10 cents, bringing the total for the
year to an unchanged 15 cents.
UOB net profits for the year ending December 31 1992 were SDollars 300.79m,
a rise of 15 per cent on the SDollars 261.6m figure recorded in 1991.
Banking profits rose 8 per cent to SDollars 169.2m.
UOB said earnings per share rose to 52.8 cents in 1992, compared with 46.7
cents the previous year. The bank is paying a maintained dividend of 10
cents.
Both OCBC and UOB results were slightly ahead of market expectations.
Singapore's big banks continue to be among the world's best-capitalised
financial institutions.
Most analysts predict further strong growth in 1993.
A recent Merrill Lynch report estimated that OCBC's combined capital
adequacy ratio, including latent reserves, could be as high as 35 per cent.
The island republic's conservatively-run banks are now being encouraged by
the government to use their large cash reserves to help Singapore companies
expand overseas.
The banks have already stepped up their offshore lending activities,
particularly in south-east Asia.

POWER generation projects for energy-starved China present almost boundless

Mr Fox, speaking in Beijing at a Sino-British commercialisation and capital
project financing seminar, said 'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) deals would
help China overcome a shortfall of financing from traditional sources such
as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. BOT schemes are infrastructure
projects built, operated and paid for by a promoter before transfer to

<TEXT>
MR TOMILSON Hill resigned yesterday as co-president of Lehman Brothers, the
Wall Street investment bank, after Mr Richard Fuld was appointed sole
president of the firm by Mr Harvey Golub, chairman of American Express,
Lehman's parent group
The departure of Mr Hill from Lehman was unexpected. He had run the
investment banking and trading operation in tandem with Mr Fuld since 1990.
Both were veterans of the firm, which was part of the Shearson Lehman
integrated securities house until earlier this month when the Shearson
brokerage unit was sold to Primerica. Before the sale, Mr Hill had been
co-chief operating officer of Shearson Lehman with Mr Fuld.
Mr Harvey Golub, in a letter to Lehman staff, said yesterday that he had
decided that a single leader of Lehman's management would 'reduce the
potential for confusion about responsibility and authority' within the firm.
The ascension of Mr Fuld, a former bond trader, to the pole position at
Lehman represents another victory for bond traders on Wall Street. In recent
years, the huge profits generated by fixed income sales and trading have
lifted bond specialists to the tops of their firms, while colleagues from
more traditional investment banking businesses have been passed over. At
Lehman, the departing Mr Hill was known as a mergers and acquisitions
specialist.
Earlier this year, Mr John Mack was promoted from head of Morgan Stanley's
bond operations to president of the entire firm, leaving Mr Robert
Greenhill, the previous president, mergers and acquisitions veteran out in
the cold.
American Express yesterday announced that it would realise a first-quarter
after-tax gain of some Dollars 433m from the successful public offering of a
large part of its stake in First Data Corporation, which provides
information processing to the credit card industry.
The offering of 35.2m shares - 34.6m of them owned by American Express and
600,000 by the American Express Foundation - at a price of Dollars 32 a
share was announced at the start of this month.

BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's biggest company, has announced
that net profits edged ahead by 0.8 per cent to ADollars 226m (USDollars
162m) for the third quarter to the end of February, on revenue up 13.6 per
cent at ADollars 4.1bn.
Operating profits increased by 3.5 per cent to ADollars 932m, reflecting
favourable foreign exchange rates and an increase in revenue from its three
main businesses - minerals, petroleum and steel.
However, depreciation charges rose 8 per cent to ADollars 341m, largely
reflecting the inclusion of NZ Steel, acquired last year. Interest expenses
increased by 14 per cent to ADollars 144m, following the purchase of a 38
per cent stake in Foster's Brewing.
The result was at the higher end of market expectations, but BHP appears
likely to suffer a significant loss of revenue in the final quarter if
steelworkers go ahead with a threatened 24-hour strike over pay.
The steelworkers' union has warned that further industrial action could
follow unless the dispute was settled. BHP said a strike would significantly
reduce production and could threaten export sales.
The third-quarter result takes net profits for the first nine months to
ADollars 728m, 15 per cent over the period a year earlier. The directors
declared a maintained interim dividend of 21 cents a share, fully franked.
At the minerals division, net profits rose 10 per cent, before deducting
outside equity interests, to ADollars 189m. It benefited from higher sales
volumes for iron ore, manganese ore and thermal coal, plus higher copper
prices, and an increased contribution from the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine
in Papua New Guinea.
On the same basis, steel profits increased by 5.6 per cent to ADollars
39.3m, helped by higher sales volumes and the inclusion of NZ Steel.
However, BHP said the result was disappointing.
The petroleum division reported a 28 per cent increase to ADollars 106m.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Era ends at IBM Japan with
chief's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE sudden resignation of Mr Takeo Shiina from his post of chief executive
at IBM Japan, the wholly-owned subsidiary of International Business Machines
of the US, has shocked both the company's employees and its rivals.
The decision comes as the company is attempting to shift its business
strategy from hardware to software business. It represents the end of an era
and of the active business involvement of a man who has changed the
corporate culture of a subsidiary of one of the most famous US companies.
'I'm tired after 40 years,' said Mr Shiina, who is now the largely
ceremonial chairman of IBM Japan. 'I'm not the kind of person who'll drag
work to his grave.'
He said he had decided to 'retire' as IBM Japan's chief executive earlier
this month after being criticised by the local media of still trying to
exert his power after handing over the presidency to Mr Kakutaro Kitashiro.
With Mr Shiina's resignation and the departure of Mr John Akers as chief
executive of IBM, analysts fear that the relationship between the Japanese
group and its US parent, under which the former had almost total autonomy,
could change radically.
Mr Shiina argued for a flexible approach to the Japanese market in the late
1970s. He warned that the company needed to adapt to Japanese conditions,
rather than merely apply the same global business strategy. This included
centralised development of computer hardware and software. It also meant a
marketing policy which stressed direct sales through the company's own sales
force, rather than the construction of dealer networks, and a rigid
adherence to fixed prices.
Under Mr Shiina, IBM Japan formed a joint-venture company in 1983 to operate
a leasing system and set up a network of independent dealers to sell its
medium-sized computers.
Mr Shiina also dealt with the Japanese system of 'administrative guidance'
in a Japanese way. He wined and dined government officials and politicians
at IBM's convention centre at the foot of Mount Fuji. He sat on an important
advisory board at the ministry of trade and industry, and IBM Japan managed
to join the ranks of leading Japanese companies at the Keidanren, the
business leaders' organisation.
Although IBM Japan earned high profits for more than 20 years due to its
dominance in the Japanese mainframe market, the sluggish Japanese economy
and fall in capital investment has hit earnings.
The slump in IBM Japan's profitability may force its parent to impose more
aggressive cost-cutting measures. Even Mr Shiina, long an advocate of
Japanese-style management, has now pointed out that business management at
Japanese companies needs to change.
'Japanese companies cannot go on unscathed by foreign criticism without
making sacrifices. They need to bleed, too,' he said.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Minorco to acquire 50% stake in
Irish zinc-lead operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINORCO, the Luxembourg-based overseas investment arm of Anglo American of
South Africa, is to buy a half-share in the Lisheen project in Country
Tipperary, the second-largest zinc-lead deposit in Europe, for about Dollars
72m.
This represents another important step in Minorco's ambition to become a
hands-on operating company in the natural resources industry. It comes only
days after Minorco agreed to pay Redland Pounds 55m (Dollars 78.10m) for
Steetley Iberia, a Spanish aggregates business.
Minorco will buy the Lisheen stake from Ivernia West, a small Irish
exploration company. Ivernia owns 47.5 per cent of Lisheen and various other
exploration licenses in the area, and is to buy the outstanding 52.5 per
cent from Chevron, the US oil company.
Originally, Chevron was to sell its holding to Lac Minerals of Canada, but
an arbitrator ruled that Ivernia had pre-emptive rights.
Mr David Hough, Ivernia's managing director, said Minorco would provide
Dollars 66m for his company to take up its pre-emptive rights, taking in
exchange a half-share in Lisheen. Ivernia would have 100 per cent of all
other licenses.
Minorco would pay about Dollars 6m to Chevron to cover the US company's
costs in the venture. Also, Minorco would provide Ivernia with up to Dollars
18m to pay for Ivernia's share of cash needed for the planning and
pre-feasibility study processes.
No Ivernia equity would be issued so the shareholdings of Ivernia's two big
investors, Minorco and Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group, would
remain at 24.5 per cent each.
Mr Hough said Outokumpu's two representatives on the Ivernia board had voted
in favour of the arrangements agreed with Minorco.
The South African company will operate the Lisheen project, where reserves
are estimated to total 25m tonnes of 11.8 per cent zinc, nearly 2 per cent
lead and to contain 1 troy ounce of silver a tonne. Mr Hough said it would
cost about Dollars 140m to develop a mine at Lisheen which should be capable
of generating an annual profit of Dollars 40m to Dollars 50m.
He said it was hoped planning approvals for the project would be completed
by October and that a mine would start operating late in 1995 or early in
1996.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Broken Hill edges to ADollars
226m for quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's biggest company, has announced
that net profits edged ahead by 0.8 per cent to ADollars 226m (USDollars
162m) for the third quarter to the end of February, on revenue up 13.6 per
cent at ADollars 4.1bn.
Operating profits increased by 3.5 per cent to ADollars 932m, reflecting
favourable foreign exchange rates and an increase in revenue from its three
main businesses - minerals, petroleum and steel.
However, depreciation charges rose 8 per cent to ADollars 341m, largely
reflecting the inclusion of NZ Steel, acquired last year. Interest expenses
increased by 14 per cent to ADollars 144m, following the purchase of a 38
per cent stake in Foster's Brewing.
The result was at the higher end of market expectations, but BHP appears
likely to suffer a significant loss of revenue in the final quarter if
steelworkers go ahead with a threatened 24-hour strike over pay.
The steelworkers' union has warned that further industrial action could
follow unless the dispute was settled. BHP said a strike would significantly
reduce production and could threaten export sales.
The third-quarter result takes net profits for the first nine months to
ADollars 728m, 15 per cent over the period a year earlier. The directors
declared a maintained interim dividend of 21 cents a share, fully franked.
At the minerals division, net profits rose 10 per cent, before deducting
outside equity interests, to ADollars 189m. It benefited from higher sales
volumes for iron ore, manganese ore and thermal coal, plus higher copper
prices, and an increased contribution from the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine
in Papua New Guinea.
On the same basis, steel profits increased by 5.6 per cent to ADollars
39.3m, helped by higher sales volumes and the inclusion of NZ Steel.
However, BHP said the result was 'disappointing'.
The petroleum division reported a 28 per cent increase to ADollars 106m,
reflecting higher oil and liquefied natural gas production. Lower crude oil
prices were more than offset by a reduction in the value of the Australian
dollar against the US currency.
BHP said 'significant progress' had been made towards finalising a
production sharing contract for the prospective Dai Hung offshore oilfield
in Vietnam. BHP Petroleum will operate the field, with a 43.75 per cent
interest.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Kleinwort sees financing
openings in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POWER generation projects for energy-starved China present almost boundless
opportunities for creative financing according to Mr Robin Fox,
vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank.
Mr Fox, who was a guest speaker in Beijing at a Sino-British
commercialisation and capital project financing seminar, said
'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) deals would help China overcome an acute
shortfall of financing available from traditional sources such as the World
Bank and Asian Development Bank.
BOT schemes - under which infrastructure projects are built, operated and
paid for by a promoter for an agreed period before being transferred to
government ownership - have already been pioneered in China by Mr Gordon Wu,
the Hong Kong businessman who heads property development group Hopewell
Holdings.
He has built a power station in southern Guangdong province and is in the
process of building a second.
China recently announced it would allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of
power utilities.
This is a sure sign that it is desperate to engage foreign capital in
efforts to overcome chronic energy shortages that are proving a drag on
economic growth that neared 13 per cent last year.
China is circulating a list of 28 power projects totalling 45,000 megawatts
that it hopes to begin work on in the next three years, finance permitting.
This, Mr Fox believes, is where opportunities lie for financial
intermediaries.
'World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other international agencies will be
fully involved, but it is likely they can only meet a limited proportion of
the finance requirements,' he said.
'China has already moved quickly to accept an increased reliance on market
forces and significantly increased private sector participation.' Mr Fox
said BOT schemes could also be used for other infrastructure development
such as toll-roads, ports, bridges and airports, but these were trickier in
terms of securing a guaranteed return on investment to satisfy financial
backers.
Power stations, on the other hand, were more easily geared to recouping
outlays from tariffs paid by consumers, Mr Fox said.
'A power purchase contract can guarantee the revenue stream for a power
station project,' he observed. 'But it is clearly less practical to conclude
contracts with users of a toll road or passenger rail system.'

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japanese watchdog aims to
silence wagging tongues - Commission's quest to clean up stock markets and
restore confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BENEATH the flickering red lights of an electronic stock board showing Tokyo
share prices edging higher, Mr Masami Ishizaka, the head of Japan's
Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, had reason to be relaxed
about his crusade to clean up the Japanese stock markets and restore
investor confidence shaken by a flurry of scandals.
Established in the heat of scandal, the commission, however, has found it
difficult to cultivate the image of an aggressive and independent watchdog.
It still shares a building with the finance ministry and takes its staff on
a rotation basis.
Mr Ishizaka, SESC secretary general, is mildly irritated by the
often-expressed scepticism of Japanese business commentators, who have
suggested the commission answers to a finance ministry which has restruck
its close relationship with the securities industry.
'We are not at all controlled by the finance ministry,' he says. 'Each
institution has its own responsibilities. The ministry issues licences to
securities houses, but we are in charge of investigations. If we make a
recommendation for action, something should be done about it.'
The commission's 203 staff, also including ex-prosecutors and former tax
investigators, like to compare themselves to the Fair Trade Commission,
Japan's anti-monopoly body, which has become increasingly vigilant in the
past three years, partly due to intense US pressure to clear away cartels.
With well-publicised raids on bid-rigging printing houses and price-fixing
electronics companies, the FTC has at least given industrial Japan cause for
contemplation. It is still criticised by the US for not being tough enough,
but has also been condemned by business organisations for its zeal.
The same cannot be said of the SESC, which has released details of only one
investigation: a case against Cosmo Securities, a second-tier broker found
to be guilty of tobashi - shuffling stocks around client accounts to avoid
booking a loss.
Cosmo was told in December to suspend corporate business in Tokyo for a
week, and to stop dealing in convertible bonds on its own account for four
weeks.
Promising to be even more vigilant than the FTC, Mr Ishizaka explains the
SESC's low profile by emphasising: 'We are only getting started.' He said
comparisons with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were not
useful because of the different structure of the two financial systems. But
he is confident his commission has put pressure on brokers to play by the
rules.
'I think the securities houses see us as something that is quite
frightening. We emphasise to them that we want to ensure that the prosperity
of the industry is fair and just.'
Over the past two years, the industry has been forced to confess that some
of its prosperity was not 'fair and just'. Leading brokers admitted to stock
price manipulation, compensating favoured corporate clients, and links to
one group of unsavoury investors, the yakuza, or gangsters.
After the controversy and condemnation, Mr Ishizaka said the industry
appeared to have learned from the mistakes and was attempting to reform its
management. Despite the favourable comparison with the FTC, he says the
commission is 'willing to support this gradual change'.
But the pressure for change has eased as Tokyo stock prices have risen over
the past month. The SESC was commissioned when the Nikkei stock market
average was languishing at around 16,000, and reassuring investors was a
government priority. The SESC was to ensure that all were treated equally,
and the bad habits of the 'bubble' era of the late 1980s were reformed.
Yesterday, the Nikkei market average rose rose 1.4 per cent to 19,048.38,
the highest close since last March 31, the end of the fiscal year, when
financial institutions and industrial companies closed the books and
calculated losses or gains on their stock portfolios.
Japanese brokers say the market has bottomed and the boisterous, bullish
trading days have returned. Daily market turnover has topped 800m recently,
four times that of February, and speculative stocks have returned to
fashion.
Big turnover stocks yesterday included Nippon Housing Loan, a crippled home
loan institution now under reconstruction, and companies involved in Aids
research such as Meiji Milk, a dairy products group. It remains unclear
whether stocks have really turned the corner - the market was trading
yesterday on a price/earnings ratio of 65.8 times.
The SESC was also formed amid severe criticism of the the intimate
relationship between the finance ministry and financial institutions. The
ministry's lack of will to control undisciplined brokers and often obscure
administrative guidance were cited as causes of the stock scandals.
Responding to the controversy, the ruling Liberal Democratic party decided
the relationship, sometimes clouded by ministry officials' expectation of a
future job in banking or broking, was in need of reform. Apart from
investigation, the SESC was given the power to 'propose policies' to keep
financial markers fair.
Time has passed, and the debate has faded. Mr Ishizaka sees positive aspects
in the traditionally close ties: 'The finance ministry has various
administrative functions, and it is useful that the ministry and the brokers
are close.'

<TEXT>
BAHRAIN-based United Gulf Bank revealed yesterday that net profit fell 27
per cent in 1992 to Dollars 13.7m from Dollars 18.8m a year earlier, AP-DJ
reports.
The offshore banking unit said its gross income rose 35 per cent in 1992 to
Dollars 25.1m from Dollars 18.6m, helped by a large increase in income from
investment in managed portfolios.
However, it said the increased costs of funding and hedging its assets,
owing to the high interest rate climate during 1992, resulted in a loss on
interest expenses of Dollars 6.85m, compared with a loss of Dollars 953,000
a year earlier.
Additionally, the bank's foreign exchange operations showed a loss of
Dollars 2.74m, compared with a gain of Dollars 2.45m in the previous year.
United Gulf said these factors pared the gross income, leaving the bank
showing a sharp fall in net income, compared with a year earlier.
Total assets of the bank increased 32 per cent, however. At the end of 1992,
assets were Dollars 297.1m, against with Dollars 225m at the end of 1991.
The bank's statement also showed that the bank's accumulated deficit fell to
Dollars 28m from Dollars 40.4m a year earlier.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S position as an international financial centre has waned over the
past four years as foreign banks and brokers have become frustrated by
opaque market practices and the slow pace of financial deregulation.
According to a survey by the Japan Center for International Finance, an
affiliate of the ministry of finance, only 6 per cent of 67 foreign
financial institutions questioned believed the Tokyo market could pip New
York and London to become the leading financial market within five years.
This figure is sharply lower than in 1989, when 32 per cent of those
surveyed expected Tokyo to lead the other two markets in five years' time.
The figures reflect the weakness of the Tokyo stock market, which has forced
some foreign brokers to restructure their Japanese operations and, in some
cases, withdraw from the market altogether.
Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch, the US brokerages, have recently
announced reorganisations. County NatWest, the securities arm of National
Westminster Bank of the UK, last year became the first foreign broker to
relinquish its seat on the Tokyo stock exchange.
Only 9 per cent of respondents said they were satisfied with the extent of
financial deregulation in Japan, and 49 per cent said liberalisation was
inadequate compared with London and New York. Some 23 per cent said the
financial markets were far from being liberalised.
On the stability of Japan's financial system, 22 per cent said there was a
lack of disclosure over the extent of bad loans held by Japanese banks.
A total of 67 per cent said obscure market practices and decision-making
were a problem, while others indicated that accounting and tax rules were
obstructive.
Despite their waning enthusiasm, foreign banks said profits were rising as a
result of the reluctance of Japanese banks to lend to corporations, together
with lower interest rates.
The number of foreign banks who found fund procurement from the short-term
money market difficult fell from 21 per cent in 1989 to 10 per cent.
Most foreign brokers were taking a long-term view, with 60 per cent replying
that they had a long-term strategy in Japan.
Only 5 per cent indicated they were withdrawing from the securities
business, while another 5 per cent said they were cutting securities
operations.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL Discount Bank, the country's third-largest bank, yesterday reported a
significant 53.6 per cent increase in net profits for 1992 to Shk145.4m
(Dollars 52.6m).
This sharp rise was attributed to a decrease in the size of the bank's
provision for bad debts and to an increase in income from non-banking
activities, mainly services involving the capital markets and foreign
currency.
Israel Discount's bad debt provision fell from Shk157.1m in 1991, when the
country's banks were forced to make considerable write-offs for loans given
to the troubled agricultural sector, to Shk128.4m last year.
The bank's consolidated assets totalled Shk17.5bn at the end of the year,
increasing 14.7 per cent from the previous year.
Shareholders' equity rose 10.5 per cent to Shk2.6bn, while net return on
shareholders' equity was up from 4.7 per cent in 1991 to 7 per cent in 1992.
Israel Discount Bank of New York, the bank's major subsidiary and the
largest Israeli bank operating abroad, increased its net profits in 1992 to
Dollars 14.1m from Dollars 11m in the previous year. The bank said these
results were 'satisfactory, surpassing last year's despite the economic
condition in the US'.
The New York bank's balance sheet totalled Dollars 3.9bn at the end of the
year.

improvement

<TEXT>
ALCAN Australia, a 73 per cent subsidiary of Alcan, the Canadian aluminium
group, yesterday forecast a return to profit this year, following net losses
of ADollars 15m (USDollars 10.8m) and ADollars 29m in the last two years.
However, Mr Jeremy Davis, chairman, told the annual meeting the result was
unlikely to represent a satisfactory return to shareholders.
Mr Davis said the international environment was not promising, noting that
aluminium prices had fallen to between USDollars 1,150 and USDollars 1,170 a
tonne on the London Metal Exchange.
'Aluminium prices today are the lowest they have been in real terms for more
than 20 years, and some 25 per cent below a moving average trend price for
metal over that period,' he said.
Mr Davis said the low price for aluminium reflected the continuing flow of
metal from the former Soviet Union, and widespread reluctance to close even
the world's highest-cost smelters.
He said there was no reason to expect any improvement in the current year
because many of the higher-cost smelters were controlled by governments,
which had motives other than profit for keeping them open.
Mr Davis said demand might increase in the US, but the group was not
confident of an upturn in Japan and western Europe.

AP MOLLER, the Danish shipping and oil group, yesterday agreed to take over

liner shipping and one of the oldest Danish shipping companies.
AP Moller will acquire nine large container-carrying liner vessels, which

EAC suffered a group loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars 188m) in 1992, when its
equity capital was cut to DKr2.8bn, only 17.4 per cent of assets. Turnover
last year was DKr17.3bn, much of it from extensive trading operations in
eastern Asia.
The sale price was not released, but EAC said the agreement would result in
'a very considerable strengthening of EAC's cash position' and an
appreciable reduction in its debt.
Although Moller has said it would try to offer jobs to EAC officers, EAC
said that relatively few of the group's 1,300 shipping staff could expect to
be offered employment.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Delta Air Lines in move to lay
off 600 pilots

DELTA Air Lines, one of the 'big three' US carriers, yesterday announced
plans to lay off 600 pilots - the first temporary lay-offs of permanent
staff the carrier has implemented in 36 years. Delta sought to place the
lay-offs in the context of a 'fleet simplification' plan, although the move
also appeared to be a warning shot across the pilots' union's bows.
The plan, Delta said, would involve the retirement of 21 Airbus A310
aircraft which the company took over when it acquired assets - including
transatlantic routes - from the now-defunct Pan Am in 1991. However, Delta
would accept nine new A310s which it has on order, and the net loss of 12
A310s will help to accommodate a reduction in the carrier's transatlantic
schedules next autumn.
The carrier is also planning to retire 16 Boeing 727 aircraft, most of which
are employed on the east coast 'shuttle' routes. They will be replaced on
these routes by newer 727s, plucked from elsewhere in the domestic network.
The aircraft retirements represent a 3 per cent reduction in transatlantic
capacity, and a 1 per cent reduction for the group overall.
Delta said the moves made surplus 600 pilots, and said it planned to begin
laying off employees - on a last-in, first-out basis - from June.
Mr Ron Allen, Delta chairman, was quick to deny that the staff cutbacks were
related to the carrier's long-running dispute with the Air Line Pilots
Association. However, pilots are the only employees at Delta who are
unionised, and the only group which has stood out against the carrier's
recent request for wage cuts.
According to Delta, about 11 per cent of its pilots have offered to take pay
cuts, despite the fact that their union has not been able to agree terms on
a pay reduction package with management.
An application to start a new airline, called Friendship Airlines, was filed
with the US Department of Transportation yesterday. The carrier would be
headed by Mr Stephen Kolski, a former president of Continental Express, and
backed by Mr Frank Lorenzo, the controversial former owner of Continental.
Mr Lorenzo, who was renowned in the airline industry for his hard-nosed
labour tactics and reviled by the unions, would also be a director of the
new airline.

<TEXT>
INCO, the western world's largest nickel producer, will charge USDollars 20m
against first-quarter earnings to cover the costs of restructuring its
troubled alloys business. The after-tax charge will be about Dollars 13m.
The alloys unit, known as Inco Alloys International, has been hit hard by
weakening demand, especially from aerospace and defence-related industries,
and by increasingly fierce competition.
About 60 companies are vying for market share.
Inco's alloys and engineered products division lost Dollars 29m last year on
sales of Dollars 557m. Alloys account for about half the division's
business. More than one third of the loss was incurred in the fourth
quarter, and sales for the year fell 48 per cent.
The reorganisation includes cutting the workforce by 340 people, or by 12
per cent. Inco said the cost of retirement and severance packages would make
up about half of the first-quarter write-off. Production and marketing
functions would also be streamlined.

operations up for sale
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIANCE Group, the quoted insurance company which is controlled and headed
by Mr Saul Steinberg, revealed yesterday that it is currently trying to sell
its life insurance operations in an attempt to bolster its capital base.
The company added that negotiations have already produced two potential
buyers - the first of which offered to pay approximately Dollars 525m.
However, according to Reliance, it was not possible to agree terms with this
potential purchaser, and negotiations with the second bidder - at a higher
price - commenced. The first potential buyer is now suing. Reliance
maintains that the litigation is 'without merit'.
As a result of the likely sale of the United Pacific Life Insurance
subsidiary, Reliance said that it expects to take a fourth quarter charge
and to report a loss for that period. Given the ongoing negotiations,
Reliance will also postpone reporting 1992 results until no later than April
15.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Personal care marriage sharpens
competition - Wilkinson Sword's move into Warner-Lambert's arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL this be fifth time lucky for Wilkinson Sword? After four previous
changes of ownership in 13 years, during which it was shorn of important
assets and contracted a serious debt problem, one of the grand old names in
the personal care business is about to start a new life in the arms of an
American suitor.
Last week's Dollars 142m sale of the company to Warner-Lambert, the US
pharmaceuticals and consumer products manufacturer, offers Wilkinson the
prospect of financial stability and industrial support which it has badly
lacked in the latter chapters of its 200-year history.
The deal also ends a bizarre anomaly whereby Gillette of the US, Wilkinson's
biggest competitor in the Dollars 3.5bn world wet shaving market, was a
large shareholder in and creditor of Eemland, Wilkinson's parent company.
The arrangement has drawn fire from anti-trust authorities around the world.
The combination of Wilkinson with Schick, Warner-Lambert's razor division,
will create a business with annual sales of more than Dollars 500m. Though
only a fraction of Gillette's Dollars 1.9bn annual razor and blade business,
it should provide keener competition, particularly at the upper end of the
shaving systems market.
Schick, which had sales of Dollars 316m last year, is a distant second to
Gillette in the US, although it has five times the sales of its bigger rival
in Japan, where it is market leader.
Elsewhere, Schick's sales are mainly in France and Sweden, where it has
market shares of 15 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.
In an effort to strengthen Schick's presence outside the US, Warner-Lambert
last year reorganised its international operations into a worldwide group.
The main aim was to provide a more coherent thrust for a business which had
long been fragmented along national lines.
In Europe, Schick's priority region for expansion, the Wilkinson acquisition
brings a business with sales last year of Dollars 190m, plants in Britain
and Germany, a development centre and an innovative product, the Protector
system razor launched a year ago. Wilkinson also has a small ceremonial
sword factory in west Lon-don.
But Wilkinson's most valuable asset is its sales and distribution channels,
particularly in the UK and Germany, where it does more than half its
business. These will widen Schick's access to the big supermarket chains
which account for a growing share of razor and blade sales.
Mr Morgan Morton, president of Schick Worldwide, says he plans to continue
to sell both Wilkinson's Protector and Schick's FX razor system in Europe
and to launch both products in new markets. He also expects to expand
European sales of Warner-Lambert products, such as Listerine mouthwash, and
over-the-counter markets.
'We now have the opportunity to achieve a pan-European presence,' Mr Morton
says. However, he insists Schick is not seeking a showdown with Gillette,
preferring to pursue a selective niche strategy: 'I don't think we are
looking significantly to change Gillette's market share in Europe.'
He expects Wilkinson, which made a small profit last year, to be able to
finance its own growth. The company recently expanded by 50 per cent
production of the Protector, which has proven more popular than expected,
particularly in Germany.
In any event, new ownership will free Wilkinson of the crippling financial
problems and internal disagreements which forced Eemland to put it up for
sale last year, less than five years after buying it from Stora, the Swedish
forest products group for SKr4bn (Dollars 518m).
Stora acquired Wilkinson as a result of taking over Swedish Match, which had
bought the business from Allegheny International, a US industrial
conglomerate which had owned Wilkinson since 1980.
Eemland is owned by assorted investors, including a group of Scandinavian
financial institutions and J. P. Morgan, the US bank, as well as Gillette.
The consortium was formed specifically to buy Wilkinson in one of the most
highly leveraged buy-outs of the late 1980s.
Even after selling Wilkinson's matches and lighters business to pay off some
of its borrowings, Eemland remained saddled with about Dollars 300m of debt,
which it was increasingly hard-pressed to service out of Wilkinson's slim
profits. More than one-third of the debt was owed to Gillette in the form of
a roll-up loan carrying an exceptionally high interest rate.
Eemland's fragile finances were strained to breaking point by the investment
in Protector, which was developed without the knowledge of the Eemland board
because Wilkinson was worried that Gillette would learn about the project. A
further source of difficulty was the growing anti-trust pressure on Gillette
to sever its involvement in Eemland.
Warner-Lambert has bought Wilkinson free of debt, at a price which leaves
Eemland's shareholders with a loss of about Dollars 200m on their
investment. Most of it is expected to be borne by Scandinavian institutions,
notably Copenhagen Handelsbank and the SPP and Skandia insurance companies,
which have paid dearly for their short-lived adventure at the razor's edge.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICROSOFT today launches a new version of MS-DOS, the operating system
program used by an estimated 130m personal computer users.
The success of MS-DOS, which controls the basic functions of PC's based on
Intel microprocessors, has made Microsoft the world's largest PC software
supplier.
Mr Bill Gates, the US company's founder and chairman, will formally
introduce MS-DOS Version 6 in San Francisco at an event to be broadcast to
PC users throughout the US.
Over 400 PC manufacturers will begin shipping computers loaded with the new
software this week, Microsoft said. Computer users may switch to Dos 6 by
purchasing a Dollars 50 upgrade program. Microsoft is said to be planning a
Dollars 7m publicity campaign.
Analysts estimate that about 6 per cent of PC users will upgrade to MS-Dos
6, generating revenues of Dollars 300m for Microsoft, including up to
Dollars 20m in pre-launch shipments and Dollars 100m in its fourth fiscal
quarter ending June 30.
MS-Dos 6 incorporates several functions that are sold separately in programs
offered by Microsoft competitors. For example, it offers data compression,
which nearly doubles the amount of information that can be stored on
computer disks, along with better memory management, data back-up, and
protection from computer viruses and accidental erasure of data.
The introduction of MS-Dos 6 poses a challenge to companies such as Symantec
and Central Point Software that offer add-on utility programs providing
similar functions. As more utilities are built into the operating system,
suppliers of competing stand-alone products will be able to charge less for
their software, analysts said.
The US retail price for MS-Dos 6 will be Dollars 49.95 to May 31 and Dollars
129.95 thereafter.

shipping business

<TEXT>
AP MOLLER, the Danish shipping and oil group, yesterday agreed to take over
the shipping operations of the East Asiatic Company, a long-term rival in
liner shipping and one of the oldest Danish shipping companies.
AP Moller will acquire nine large container-carrying liner vessels, which
will continue in service, said APM.
EAC suffered a group loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars 188m) in 1992, when its
equity capital was cut to DKr2.8bn, only 17.4 per cent of assets. Turnover
last year was DKr17.3bn, much of it from extensive trading operations in
eastern Asia.
The sale price was not released, but EAC said the agreement would result in
'a very considerable strengthening of EAC's cash position' and an
appreciable reduction in its debt.
The group began a programme of disposals last year in order to strengthen
its financial position, including the sale of the Plumrose food processing
operations in the UK, Germany and the US.
But the sale of the shipping operations was forced on it when negotiations
with American President Lines for a partnership in EAC's Europe-Far East
liner shipping operations fell through last week. The service was operated
jointly by EAC and the UK's Ben Line until the middle of 1992, when Ben
pulled out.
APM already operates a fleet of over 50 liner vessels and its stock of
containers is over 150,000 units. In addition to a liner service between
Europe and the Far East, EAC has operated a liner service between Australia
and the Far East and inter-Asian liner services.
Although Moller has said it will try to offer jobs to officers on board EAC
ships, EAC said that relatively few of the group's 1,300 shipping staff
could expect to be offered employment by Moller.

BOBST, the Swiss packaging machinery group, saw consolidated net income fall
8.6 per cent last year to SFr65m (Dollars 43m) on sales of SFr1.01bn, down

The directors said there was an accelerated slowdown during the last months
of the year, particularly in Europe.
They expect a recovery in 1993, particularly in the US, 'but not sufficient
to avoid a further slowdown of the overall activity this year'.
The group has announced plans to convert its parti-cipation shares into
bearer shares and to split the registered and bearer shares on the basis of
two for each one held.
Forbo, the Swiss floor and wall coverings group, has reported an 8 per cent
slide in consolidated net income to SFr46.1m on sales up 1 per cent to
SFr1.8bn.
The group said the result was satisfactory in spite of the increasingly
acute impact of recession, especially in Scandinavia, Britain and

target

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY said yesterday it had come close to achieving its first-year
target of 11m visitors to its theme park, but that hotel occupancy and
spending per head were still below expectations.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, who was appointed chairman last January, said the
company still expected to make a loss this year. Euro Disney made a pre-tax
loss of FFr339m (Dollars 60.3m) in the year to September 30 1992 and
announced a deficit of FFr492m for the first quarter of the current year.
However, Mr Steve Burke, executive vice-president, said, that the park would
achieve 11m visitors by the end of next month, only a few weeks after its
first anniversary on April 12. After a slow start, Euro Disney had been
expected to fall 500,000 visitors short of its first-year target.
Mr Burke said the improved attendance figures were the result of intensive
marketing in France, where interest in visiting the park had been below
expectations.
Analysts warned that the financial impact would be limited by discounted
tickets and the cost of extra staff to cope with the increase in visitors.
The company had offered residents of the Paris region 20 per cent to 30 per
cent discounts on entrance prices from January to the end of March. Even
more effective, Mr Burke said, were sales visits to companies and schools
throughout France.
Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in
London, revised her forecasts for Euro Disney's second-quarter loss to
FFr650m from FFr750m following yesterday's announcement. She expects Euro
Disney to produce a profit of FFr375m in the second half, reducing its total
loss to FFr769m in the full financial year to September 30.
Euro Disney's financial performance has been affected not only by its
initial operational difficulties, but also by unexpectedly high financing
costs. It has been hit by the rise in French interest rates and a shortfall
in capital gains.

PARMALAT, the Italian milk and dairy foods company, raised net group profits
by almost 24 per cent to L52bn (Dollars 32.9m) last year, due partly to a 23
per cent rise in sales to L1,636bn.
Mr Calisto Tanzi, chairman, said sales should reach about L2,800bn this
year, thanks to further acquisitions.
Acquisitions this year include a stake in Giglio, an Italian dairy group
with sales of about L400bn; Atlanta Dairy, a US dairy products concern with
about L100bn in turnover; Lacesa, a dairy products group; and the associated
Sodilac company in Brazil, with sales of about Dollars 80m.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Italian textile group seeks
partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GFT, Italy's biggest privately-owned textiles and clothing group, is looking
for a partner to help to inject cash into its troubled operations.
Although Turin-based GFT, which is owned by the Rivetti family, admitted it
was ready to accept the sale of a significant stake to an outside
shareholder, reports of advanced negotiations with Miroglio, a leading
privately-owned textiles and clothing group, were without foundation, it
said.
A takeover of GFT, which had sales of about L1,500bn (Dollars 949m) last
year, by the slightly smaller Miroglio would create Italy's third-biggest
textiles and clothing concern behind Benetton and Marzotto, with turnover of
about L2,700bn.
GFT has grown rapidly through acquisitions and supply agreements with some
of Italy's best-known designers. However, earnings have come under pressure
owing to high domestic costs and heavy interest charges on net debt of about
L400bn. In 1991, the group lost L42.6bn, a figure unlikely to have been
bettered in 1992.
GFT denied reports that it had failed to find a financial institution to
take a minority holding, forcing it to give up control to Miroglio, one of
Italy's most successful private textile groups. 'The search for a partner is
under way, and many alternatives are being considered,' it said.
