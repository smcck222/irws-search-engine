FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: TUC boss scorns jobless schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Willis, TUC general-secretary, yesterday said the new package of
measures for the jobless was 'derisory'. But Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
Employment Secretary, said the schemes focused on individuals, the long-term
unemployed and on new ideas.
The package, with a gross cost of Pounds 225m and a net cost of Pounds 125m,
contains five main elements.
The measures include:
Tec challenge. Training and Enterprise Councils will be invited to bid for
Pounds 25m to develop and run innovative new ways to tackle unemployment.
The new fund will be welcomed by Tecs, which are starved of cash, to pilot
radical new ideas.
Workstart pilots. Employers will be given a financial incentive of about
Pounds 60 a week - part of the benefit of the long-term unemployed person
they take on.
Four pilots will be run to test the market, two by Tecs and two by the
Employment Service. The pilots will concentrate on those unemployed for two
and four years respectively.
Community Action. This scheme, a re-run of the Voluntary Projects Programme
set up in 1982, will offer 60,000 places a year to those unemployed for 12
months and more. The scheme will be run by the Employment Service and will
provide part-time work on large-scale projects run by voluntary
organisations.
The Employment Service will help with job-hunting during the rest of the
week. The scheme will offer benefit plus Pounds 10 a week and thus could
suffer the same unpopularity as Employment Action, a similar-size scheme,
which was run by Tecs and which is to be amalgamated this April with
Employment Training.
Learning for work. Some Pounds 67m will provide up to 30,000 places for
people unemployed for 12 months plus allow them to pursue full-time
vocationally related courses. No alteration has been made to the so-called
21-hour rule which limits part-time study for the jobless.
Business start-up. This scheme, run by Tecs, offers financial incentives to
unemployed people wanting to set up their own businesses. An extra Pounds
21m will be provided for 10,000 people.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: How others saw the speech
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'It won't harm the recovery, that's the important thing. Iwanted him to do
as little as possible, and that's what he did. Not a single adjustment was
out of harmony. It will give a lot of confidence to business, especially
that the government is starting to tackle the fiscal gap. But he has left me
to go on running my business, and that's what I wanted to be able to do.'
Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, The UK's biggest electrical retailer
'Our customers in retailing are no worse off and no better off. As retailers
we were particularly pleased with the freezing of the unified business rate
for another year. But the biggest problem is still the housing market. I
think raising the threshold for stamp duty will have a positive effect on
that, but we have got a long way to go. There were not many surprises in it,
but I don't think it was lacklustre.
Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, Sears group (including Selfridges,
Wallis, Warehouse, Adams, Hornes, Olympus and Dolcis stores)
'This Budget means tax increases this year., tax increases next year and tax
increases the year after, a massive betrayal the election pronises.'
Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor
'His proposals for 1993-94 are sensible. But his fiscal stance for 1994/95
makes a rather firm assumption that economic recovery will be under way
before it has actually happened.'
Nigel Whittaker, executive director of Kingfisher and chairman of CBI retail
trade committee
'This cautious and cold-hearted Budget offers little joy for the jobless and
little hope for the homeless.'
Rodney Bickerstaffe, general secretary of Nupe
'The statement is based on the assumption that economic recovery is well
under way and can be sustained. But in construction the recovery is still
very limited and fragile. It is important, therefore, that the Budget paves
the way for a further cut in interest rates as soon as possible.'
Sir Brian Hill, president of Building Employers Confederation
'This Budget does nothing to bring about the massive switch from consumption
to investment which is essential for lasting recovery.'
Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation.
'This is close to the budget the CBI asked for ..but we would have liked an
assurance on the continuation of improved investment allowances, and the
Budget comes with a sting in the tail: future tax increases.'
Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Self-employed free to assess their own tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most far-reaching reform of the personal tax system for nearly 50 years
was announced by the chancellor yesterday. It is intended to simplify the
chore of filling in tax forms and will mean that about 8m taxpayers will be
able to assess their own liability to tax.
If the proposals work out as intended taxpayers will normally have to deal
with the Inland Revenue once or twice a year when they send in their returns
and payments. This should do away with the present system of estimated
assessments, appeals, postponements, appeal hearings and revised
assessments, the Revenue said.
Legislation will be introduced next year but the changes are not due to take
effect until the 1996-97 tax year. The first completed self-assessment
returns will be due at the beginning of 1998, a year later than suggested in
a consultative paper last November.
Organisations representing small businesses and the self-employed welcomed
the change as further proof of the government's serious intent to reduce the
burden of red tape. But Mr Richard Brown, policy director at the British
Chambers of Commerce, said he remained unconvinced that there would be a
real simplification of procedures.
The new system, which is intended to provide taxpayers with just one tax
statement and one tax bill for all their income, will affect 4m people who
are self-employed or living off investments and a further 4m employees and
pensioners who receive tax returns.
For the self-employed there are special rules, under the present system, for
assessing the profits of the first three and last three years of the
business. The chancellor's proposals are designed to sweep away these
complications, the Inland Revenue said.
Under the new system most tax returns will be accepted without further
inquiries but the Revenue will have the right to check any return. If
taxpayers fail to send in payments, returns or their accounts on time they
will face extra charges.
The Revenue believes the new system will lead to substantial savings in time
and effort for both taxpayers and itself. But anyone who cannot work out his
or her tax bill, or does not wish to do so, can call upon the Revenue to do
it for them.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Mortgage interest tax relief is cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE LENDERS and housebuilders greeted the chancellor's measures to
limit mortgage interest tax relief next year, while doubling stamp duty
threshold immediately, with cautious approval and relief that changes were
not more severe.
Building societies had feared a more decisive move against mortgage interest
tax relief, but said they believed the delay in the move to next year would
limit any potential to depress transactions in a fragile housing market.
The doubling of the stamp duty threshold to Pounds 60,000 follows a
temporary abolition of stamp duty at the end of 1991, which was judged a
failure because it led only to a temporary surge in transactions followed by
a steep fall.
Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, said the limitation
of tax relief was 'not unexpected'. The delay would allow time to re-adjust
to the Pounds 10 increase in most borrowers' monthly payments.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, said a
phased withdrawal of mortgage tax relief would lead to 'a more equitable and
rational balance of UK housing subsidies and encourage greater mobility'.
He said the society believed the proposals would 'give short-term
encouragement to the housing market and continue the gradual approach to
structural reform'.
Mr Roger Boyes, executive director of Leeds Permanent Building Society, said
permanent adjustment of stamp duty had been wanted by the industry for a
long time.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, said the measures were 'about the
best we could have hoped for. The changes in tax relief system will only
have a small impact, and will be more than offset by raising of the
threshold.'
Wimpey, the UK's second largest housebuilder, which yesterday announced a
Pounds 112.4m pre-tax loss for 1992, said its house sales had risen by a
third in the first 10 weeks compared with the corresponding period last
year.
Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said that there did not appear to be
anything in the Budget 'to stand in the way of the first flickers of
recovery in the market place'.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which represents 8,000 estate
agents, said the raising of the stamp duty threshold would 'boost the
housing market, particularly among first-time buyers - who hold the key to
revival'.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Fuel and excise duty dismay for car owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTORISTS were hit yesterday by increases in both fuel duty and vehicle
excise duty.
The taxation of the private use of company cars will also rise significantly
in the next financial year.
The company car taxation system will be drastically reformed from 1994/95
through a system based on car list prices rather than on engine size. This
will mean increases in tax bills for a large minority of drivers but smaller
bills for more than half. Thereafter, individuals' own choice of cars will
determine the size of their tax liability.
The government warned yesterday that the cost of motoring is set to rise in
real terms every year. It intends to raise road fuel duties by at least 3
per cent a year in real terms in all future Budgets as an incentive for
motorists to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles.
The price of a gallon of unleaded petrol rose yesterday by 12p to around
Pounds 2.29, while that of a gallon of 4-star rose by 15p to around Pounds
2.52.
Duties on all road fuels, including diesel, rose by 10 per cent and the
vehicle excise duty on cars was raised by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125.
These raise by Pounds 50 the average cost of motoring for a driver covering
10,000 miles a year.
Company car users face a further 8 per cent increase this year in tax scale
charges, which the chancellor claimed would raise company car taxation 'to a
level which fully reflects the true value of the benefit of a company car.'
In spite of the increases, the motor industry gave a cautious welcome to the
Budget, but car retailers warned of the impact on new car sales of the
chancellor's determination to increase the cost of motoring in real terms in
every future Budget.
The Automobile Association said the government's motoring tax proposals were
'more highway robbery'.
'With one hand the chancellor has taken more from the motorist in excise
duty than he needs to replace new car tax; with the other, he has made all
motorists subsidise new cars, and done little to benefit the environment or
industry.'
Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, said: 'The increase in both fuel
tax and vehicle excise duty further increases the cost of motoring, but, on
balance, affects the cost of usage more than ownership, which is our
preferred option.'
Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, said that the reform of company car taxation was 'extremely
welcome'.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation said the company car tax reforms were
'sensible' and would 'produce a fairer and more transparent tax system than
previously'.
The Freight Transport Association claimed that industry's costs had risen by
at least Pounds 230m a year with the 10 per cent increase in the duty on
diesel. 'In real terms this increase in fuel duty will mean that the cost of
operating a 38 tonne truck will go up by about Pounds 1,000 a year,' it
said.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Doubts remain about promised rail bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S BUDGET gave the go-ahead to plans for the long-awaited Pounds
300m Heathrow Express but triggered deep concern about the outlook for other
transport projects.
The chancellor said that the government would be prepared to contribute
towards a privately-funded channel tunnel rail link but gave no indication
of where the private sector funding was to come from.
He also raised the spectre of long delays for central London's badly-needed
Pounds 1.8bn Crossrail scheme by announcing that it would be re-appraised as
a candidate for private-sector financing.
Mr Norman Lamont held up all three projects as examples of ways in which his
Autumn Statement initiative, aimed at attracting private-sector funding into
transport infrastructure projects, had moved forward.
Approval for the Heathrow Express, a joint venture between state-owned
British Rail and BAA, the private-sector airport operator, means passengers
will be able to travel from London Paddington station to Heathrow airport in
16 minutes when the line opens in 1997.
Specially designed electric trains will travel along existing British Rail
tracks for three-quarters of the journey before turning off along a
newly-built spur.
The project will cost Pounds 300m, of which Pounds 51m will be equity. BR
will contribute Pounds 15m, giving it a 30 per cent stake in the venture,
and BAA will contribute Pounds 36m, giving it 70 per cent. The balance will
be raised in commercial debt.
Mr Lamont's announcement on the channel tunnel rail link, although presented
in positive terms, marked a climb-down from the government's
previously-stated intention of getting the line built entirely by the
private sector.
He conceded that it would now be necessary for the government to make a
financial contribution to the Pounds 2.5bn project to reflect the fact that
the line would be used by long-distance commuter trains.
He said Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, would invite the private
sector to submit bids in the hope that the project would proceed to
completion 'around the end of the decade', indicating that there were still
no firm funding plans for the project.
He also delivered a slap in the face to Sir Bob Reid, British Rail's
chairman, by saying the link would run into London's St Pancras station, not
the Pounds 1.4bn terminal BR had hoped to build at King's Cross.
Mr Lamont's plans for Crossrail, a main line railway link between London's
Paddington and Liverpool Street, will cause deep concern in the capital
because the project had previously figured strongly in the government's
spending programme as a public-sector project.
The scheme is by far the biggest public transport project in the pipeline
for central London, but re-assessing it now as a scheme for possible
private-sector participation will be seen as a way of deferring it into the
indefinite future.
Construction companies and investment bankers yesterday expressed
disappointment that no fresh projects had been announced by the chancellor.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the construction group, said: 'It
was well known that the three rail schemes were on the government's
wish-list for private finance.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Tax burden increases - The Main Points
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The net result of the changes increase total tax revenues by a modest 0.1
per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to 36 1/2 per cent of GDP. But the delayed
effects of the government's tax changes mean that the Budget measures
eventually add 1.7 per cent of GDP in tax rises by 1997-98 by which time
government revenues will have risen to 39 1/4 per cent of GDP.
PSBR here to stay ..: The PSBR this fiscal year will be Pounds 35.1bn,
Pounds 1.9bn lower than the Autumn Statement forecast. But general
government expenditures of 44 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 mean a PSBR of
Pounds 50.1bn, 8 per cent of GDP, and Pounds 55.6bn excluding privatisation
receipts.
  .but maybe not for ever: The government's objective remains 'to bring the
PSBR back towards balance over the medium term'. But the government's
projections still expect a PSBR of 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 by which
time net public debt will have almost doubled since 1990 to 50 per cent of
GDP.
Full-funding rule modified: No news on interest rates, but the government
relaxed its funding policy. Sales of gilts to bank and building societies
will now be counted as a non-inflationary funding source. The government has
increased its upper limit for broad money growth next year in part to
accommodate the boost to M4 that relaxing its full-fund rule which should
allow. The target range for M0 in 1993-94 is widened from 4-8 per cent to
3-9 per cent.
'Budget for sustained growth': The chancellor said that the British economy
'enters the year in a more favourable position than most of our main
competitors' having 'won' the battle against inflation over the last two
years. Highlights of the recovery include:
Growth accelerates: Economic recovery is expected to start slowly but
accelerate next year. GDP grows by 1 1/4 per cent in 1993 but by 3 per cent
in the first half of 1994.
Inflation sticky Underlying retail price inflation remains stuck at 3 3/4
per cent until the middle of next year, near the top of the government's 0-4
per cent target range.
Trade deficit grows Rising imports means the current account deficit is
expected to rise to Pounds 17 1/2 bn this year and Pounds 18 1/2 bn in the
first half of next year, 2 3/4 per cent of GDP, in spite of projected export
growth of 10 1/2 per cent next year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor announced a package of immediate and future tax increases in
an attempt to avoid 'excessive government borrowing over the medium-term'
from preventing 'a sustained economic recovery'. His tax package is broadly
neutral this year but will boost government revenues by Pounds 6.7bn in
1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96.
Income tax: No change in the basic rate and no increase in the top rate of
tax but the 20 per cent tax band will be widened by Pounds 500 to the first
Pounds 2,500 of taxable income from April 1 this year. It will widen to the
first Pounds 3,000 in 1994. Personal allowances, the married couples'
allowance and the inheritance tax threshold of Pounds 150,000 were frozen
this year.
National insurance to rise: The main rate for employees and the
self-employed will rise by 1 per cent next year, but there will be no change
in employers' contributions.
VAT extended: Extension of the VAT base limited to domestic fuel and power.
From April 1994 it will be levied at 8 per cent, rising to 17.5 per cent in
April 1995.
Driving penalised: Road fuels will rise by 10 per cent this year to pay for
the abolition of car tax last autumn. This adds 2.7p to a litre of unleaded
and 3.3p to a litre of leaded petrol. Vehicle excise duty on cars, vans and
taxis will rise by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125. Scale charges on company cars
will rise by 8 per cent and car fuel scale charges by 20 per cent. The
discount on high business mileage will be abolished and from next year,
company cars will be taxed according to their list price rather than engine
size.
Excise duties rise: The chancellor left the duty on spirits unchanged; other
alcohol duties rose by 5 per cent. This added 1 1/2 p to a pint of beer and
5 1/2 p to a bottle of wine. A 6.5 per cent increase in tobacco duty added
10p to a packet of 20 cigarettes and 4 1/2 p to five small cigars.
Housing: The stamp duty threshold for houses, land and property was doubled
to Pounds 60,000. But tax relief on mortgage interest will be limited to 20
per cent from April next year.
Small businesses: The Budget introduced wide ranging measures to help small
businesses. Business rates will not increase in real terms this year and the
threshold above which traders are required to register for VAT will rise
from Pounds 36,600 to Pounds 37,600. There will be relief on capital gains
tax where entrepreneurs reinvest the gains from the sale of shares in their
own business in new unquoted trading companies. Premiums on the loan
guarantee scheme will be reduced and traders will also be able to claim VAT
relief on bad debts after six months. VAT penalties on late returns and
misdeclarations eased.
Industry: The rate of advanced corporation tax will be reduced to 22.5 per
cent for this financial year and to 20 per cent from April 1994. The
chancellor also announced improvements to export credits.
Long-term unemployed: A new vocational education programme will finance
30,000 unemployed people to take full-time courses. Expansion of business
start-up scheme will provide extra 10,000 places for people wishing to start
their own businesses.
Infrastructure: The channel tunnel rail link will proceed as a joint venture
between the government and the private sector and the Heathrow express will
go ahead as a joint venture between British Rail and BAA.

able to assess their own liability to tax, if they wish.
If the proposals work out as intended taxpayers will normally have to deal
with the Inland Revenue once or twice a year when they send in their returns
and payments. This should do away with the present system of estimated
assessments, appeals, postponements, appeal hearings and revised
assessments, the Revenue said.
Legislation will be introduced next year but the changes are not due to take
effect until the 1996-97 tax year. The first completed self-assessment
returns will be due at the beginning of 1998, a year later than suggested in
a consultative paper last November.
Organisations representing small businesses and the self-employed welcomed
the change as further proof of the government's serious intent to reduce the
burden of red tape. But Mr Richard Brown, policy director at the British
Chambers of Commerce, said he remained unconvinced that there would be a
real simplification of procedures.
The new system, which is intended to provide taxpayers with just one tax
statement and one tax bill for all their income, will affect 4m people who
are self-employed or living off investments and a further 4m employees and
pensioners who receive tax returns.
An important effect of the changeover will be for income being taxed in the
year in which it is earned. At present people with more than one source of
income can be taxed on a combination of previous years and the current year
with several different payment dates.
For the self-employed there are special rules, under the present system, for
assessing the profits of the first three and last three years of the
business. The chancellor's proposals are designed to sweep away these
complications, the Inland Revenue said.
Under the new system most tax returns will be accepted without further
inquiries but the Revenue will have the right to check any return. If
taxpayers fail to send in payments, returns or their accounts on time they
will face extra charges.
The Revenue believes the new system will lead to substantial savings in time
and effort for both taxpayers and itself. But anyone who cannot work out his
or her tax bill, or does not wish to do so, can call upon the Revenue to do
it for them.
Further consultations are planned to make sure that the detailed
arrangements of the new system work in practice.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: City lukewarm over gilts funding changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT yesterday announced a widely expected move to allow
purchases of government bonds by banks and building societies to count
towards the public sector borrowing requirement. However, the City warned
that further significant changes would be needed to the way the PSBR is
funded to relieve pressures in the gilts market.
The extent of the government's borrowing needs in the coming financial year
became clear as the chancellor announced an expected PSBR of Pounds 50bn.
This topped most expectations in the City by at least Pounds 5bn and led to
a fall in gilts prices by one percentage point. However, investors and
analysts said that more important influences were likely to be borrowing
needs in future years and the inflation outlook.
The move away from the so-called 'full-funding' rule to one of
'underfunding' had been urged on the chancellor by the City. This allows
gilt sales to banks and building societies to count towards the PSBR target.
By reducing the amount of gilts that need to be sold to other investors, the
intention is to ease pressure on the gilts market and prevent long-term
interest rates from rising.
Banks and building societies have bought Pounds 5.5bn of gilts in the first
11 months of the current financial year, up from less than Pounds 1bn in the
whole of 1991-92. However, most said yesterday that they would be unlikely
to increase these holdings unless the Bank of England designed some of its
gilt sales to suit the particular needs of credit institutions.
Referring to yesterday's change, Mr Roger Little, director in charge of
dealing at Abbey National, said: 'It doesn't give us any more incentive to
buy gilts than before.'
A change in policy to issuing more shorter-dated gilts, with maturities of
less than five years, would encourage more buying, a number of banks and
societies said. This is because banks prefer to hold short-dated bonds for
liquidity purposes, and because longer-dated gilts are more vulnerable to
changes in inflation and other factors.
Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays Bank, said he anticipated
discussions among banks and the Bank of England to ensure the issue of more
short-term gilts such as one-year notes which the banks would find
attractive.
'I cannot believe the Bank wants to force banks to buy the sort of long-term
gilts which they believe are unacceptably risky,' said Mr Wood. He said
short-term gilts would be appropriate as a response to a 'short-term
problem'.
Also, banks said that the difference between money-market interest rates and
short-dated gilt yields would have to widen to make it more attractive for
them to buy gilts.
At the moment, money market rates are just below 6 per cent, while five-year
gilts yield only around half a percentage point more. This difference would
need to rise by at least a percentage point to encourage banks to buy more
gilts, said Mr Philip Guy, treasurer of Hill Samuel.
Mr Richard Goeltz, chief financial officer of National Westminster Bank,
said British banks would require a more attractive yield on two or three
year bills if they were to increase their portfolios substantially. He said
the Budget had contained 'nothing that would lead us to start building a
portfolio of gilts tomorrow.'
A wider differential in the US bond market between money-market interest
rates and short-term bond yields encouraged US banks to take their holdings
of government bonds up to nearly Dollars 700bn at the end of 1992, from
about Dollars 450bn two years before. This has helped both to fund the
government borrowing requirement and guarantee the banks a healthy profit to
rebuild capital resources.
The City reacted with disappointment - though little surprise - to Mr
Lamont's announcement that stamp duty on share transactions would stay for
at least another year, raising an estimated Pounds 1bn. The tax had been
scheduled for abolition with the introduction of Taurus, the Stock
Exchange's planned paperless settlement system which was scrapped last week.

<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Rus-sian president, yesterday called for immediate and
substantial western aid to stave off what he called 'the serious danger of
reaction' in Russia.
Mr Yeltsin, speaking at a joint news conference with French president
Francois Mitterrand, said: 'There is a very, very serious threat hanging
over democracy and reforms.'
He said last week's session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the
country's top legislature, showed that communist forces were intent on
avenging their defeat in the 1991 coup attempt.
Mr Mitterrand suggested Group of Seven leaders meet as soon as possible
after Mr Yeltsin's summit with President Bill Clinton in Vancouver on April
4 to discuss Russia's problems. Mr Yeltsin added: 'We cannot wait for Tokyo
in June or July. It may prove too late.'
When asked if the west would continue its support for Mr Yeltsin if he
introduced authoritarian measures, Mr Mitterrand said: 'If we must choose
between camps in the country, then we will choose the camp which continues
democratic and economic reform.' Mr Yeltsin had 'proposals to make to the
Russian people and I am certain he will do so in a democratic way', he said.
Mr Yeltsin has said he will hold a plebiscite next month. In doing so, he
will directly challenge parliament, which has ruled such a move
unconstitutional and has voted itself the powers to strip him of office.
The French president said there were differing views among G7 countries on
aid. France and Germany believed in the need for urgent action; Japan, by
contrast, had so far refused to take part in a high-level G7 meeting before
the heads of state conference in Tokyo in July.
Mr Yeltsin also said there could be several changes in the cabinet of
ministers. In the meantime, he has signed a decree expanding his cabinet to
include central bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko, who has been accused of
undermining economic reform with easy credits. But it was not clear whether
this would strengthen Mr Yeltsin's grip on the central bank.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced it had signed
a Dollars 43.8m technical co-operation loan to aid privatisation in Russia.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Private sector may be paid to take over Docklands railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government may privatise London's Docklands Light Railway by paying the
private sector to take it over. Government advisers are studying the move as
one of the most likely options for getting the loss-making railway into
private ownership.
Built in the 1980s for Pounds 77m, the Docklands Light Railway is being
extended and upgraded at a cost of Pounds 800m to increase capacity and
improve reliability.
Earlier this month, the Department of the Environment appointed the
consultancy arm of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, to draw up a list of
options for privatising the line within the lifetime of this parliament.
The government is keen to press ahead with the plan because it wants the
private sector to build a Pounds 130m extension of the Docklands Light
Railway across the Thames to Lewisham in south-east London.
A straightforward sale or stock-market flotation of the railway is ruled out
by the losses it makes, currently more than five times its Pounds 3m annual
revenues. But Ernst &amp; Young believes the private sector could be offered a
'dowry' to take the railway off the government's hands.
This could stir up a controversy similar to the one that accompanied the
government's recent disposal of the Property Services Agency's projects
division to Tarmac, the construction group, with payments or guarantees
worth about Pounds 100m.
Another option would be to franchise the operation of the railway to the
company wanting the smallest subsidy to run it. But this could prove less
attractive than an outright sale because the government would remain the
owner.
The railway's performance, once notoriously unreliable, has improved sharply
in the past few months under a new management team headed by Sir Peter
Levene, former head of defence procurement at the Ministry of Defence. Last
week, Sir Peter announced that the railway was to pay Brown &amp; Root, the US
engineering group, Pounds 30m over the next three years to get the railway
running smoothly and cut its costs.
Mr Eric Anstey, Ernst &amp; Young's director of privatisation and utilities
services, said the railway could become profitable next decade if the
property market recovered and the Lewisham extension was built.

He said last week's session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the

Mr Yeltsin said he would not make 'rash decisions' but would decide what to
do soon. He and Mr Mitterrand said the crisis would have to be settled in
the next few weeks.
The French president made clear there were sharply differing views among G7
countries on the question of aid. France and Germany were leading those who
believed in the need for urgent action. Japan, by contrast, had so far
refused to take part in a high-level G7 meeting before the scheduled heads
of state conference in Tokyo in July.
Mr Mitterrand suggested that, if Japan continued to refuse to take part, the
meeting should go ahead outside the formal boundaries of the G7 process. The
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced it had signed a
Dollars 43.8m technical co-operation loan to aid privatisation in Russia.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Italy's corruption probe forces out third party leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of Italy's Liberal party resigned yesterday. He is the third
party head in a month forced to step down after being implicated in the
corruption scandals that have rocked the country.
Mr Renato Altissimo's move came after he was warned on Monday he was under
investigation by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving L50m (Pounds
22,500) in illicit funds from Enel, the national electricity authority.
Mr Altissimo, who denied any wrongdoing, was one of 10 parliamentarians this
week advised they were under investigation over Enel payments.
The small Liberal party is a partner in the four-party government coalition
led by prime minister Giuliano Amato, but Mr Altissimo's decision is not
expected to affect its stability.
Nevertheless, it underlines again the extent to which the corruption scandal
is eroding the credibility of the traditional parties and removing
well-known figures from public life. Already Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist
leader, and Mr Giorgio La Malfa of the Republicans have had to step down
after being accused of accepting illegal payments.
Mr Amato again came under fierce attack in parliament yesterday. There were
chaotic scenes in the Chamber of Deputies, where opposition MPs from the
populist Lombard League at one stage dangled a hangman's noose at government
benches.
Mr Amato was frequently interrupted by members from the neo-fascist MSI
party and the Lombard League as he concluded the debate on how to confront
the crisis caused by the wave of corruption being exposed by an increasingly
assertive judiciary.
He urged parliament to adopt a bipartisan approach to dealing with
corruption. But it was still unclear how the parties would agree on
legislation to achieve a political solution to the corruption scandals.
In another development likely to undermine even further the old
politico-economic system, Milan magistrates began late yesterday to leak
excerpts of a confession by Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the head of Eni, the state
energy and chemical company, arrested a week ago.
He is said to have confirmed that Eni made a series of illicit payments to
political parties before he took over in 1990 and during his period as
chairman. The magistrates have long regarded Eni as the heart of the system
of illicit party funding.
The scale of parliamentary involvement in the scandal has also been
underlined this week by the fresh action of Milan magistrates and also by
magistrates in Naples and Reggio Calabria.

</HEADLINE>

Wimpey's results confirmed that the housebuilding sector remains a
kaleidoscope of blue language, red ink and green shoots. On balance, Mr
Norman Lamont's Budget seems likely to encourage the incipient revival in
the housing market even if it does not immediately help corporate
profitability.
Many housebuilders have recently reported a strong rise in demand in
response to lower interest rates. Wimpey was typical in announcing a 33 per
cent increase in house sales since the start of the year. The slight caution
that spread ahead of the Budget will probably now evaporate. For first-time
buyers, at least, the increase in the threshold for stamp duty is likely to
be a more significant incentive than the reduction in mortgage interest
relief proves a deterrent. But a rise in the volume of housing transactions
will not necessarily provide an instant stimulus to prices. Housebuilders
have had to provide carrots to attract buyers. Negative equity will continue
to depress the general market. The new threshold for stamp duty will make it
hard for prices to rise above Pounds 60,000 for those houses aimed at
first-time buyers. This may not prove too great a problem: last year about
two-thirds of new houses were sold below that price.
Nevertheless, housebuilders will continue to face margin pressure. Price
increases for a range of building materials will squeeze profits. Land
prices now seem set to rise faster than house prices - favouring those
companies which can boast long land banks.

The chancellor's decision to exempt spirits from excise duty represents a
considerable victory for the Scotch whisky lobby. At one level it marks a
step towards redressing the discrimination against spirits in the tax regime
for alcohol. At another it is a gesture towards harmonisation of UK duties
with the much lower rates applying in Europe. The more lenient attitude of
the British government will certainly give the industry some extra
credibility in lobbying against possible duty increases elsewhere.
But there may not be much short-run effect on earnings. Though the fall in
domestic spirits consumption is expected to slow this year, the market
remains soft. Consumption trends are unlikely to be affected by the
chancellor's decision to forgo an indexation of duties which would have
added only 17p to a bottle of spirits.
For beer and wine, the story is more complicated. The decision to raise
duties on these categories by twice the inflation rate will probably make
little difference to overall consumption levels, but it will exacerbate the
problems caused by personal imports from the continent. This affects the
retail trade as much as the brewers. It is particularly unhelpful for
brewers like Whitbread whose market is concentrated in the south-east, and
which also owns the Threshers off-licence chain.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's proposed reform of the advanced corporation tax system
looks like a can of worms for UK equities. By lowering the rate of ACT
payable by companies on dividends, Mr Lamont will also reduce the credit
recoverable by tax-exempt investment institutions from the Inland Revenue.
That will reduce pension funds' income from UK equities by Pounds 1bn a year
by 1995, when the ACT rate is lowered to 20 per cent.
Since pension funds own a large slice of the UK equity market, lower share
prices may result. High yield stocks could be hardest hit because their
investment returns will fall the most. Fund managers might equally place a
higher value on the gross investment income offered by gilts. There is also
the thorny question of valuing the pension funds themselves: actuaries
valuing equity holdings on the basis of anticipated dividend income may have
little option but to break out the red ink.
Companies which cannot offset ACT against their mainstream corporation tax
should be the beneficiaries. BAT Industries, for example, which wrote off
Pounds 96m surplus ACT last year, will have the option in future of paying
its dividend out of a designated stream of overseas earnings. If a surplus
arises, ACT can then be recovered from the Revenue. The snag is that such
'foreign income dividends' will be paid without a tax credit and are
therefore worth 20 per cent less to a pension fund. The company could always
increase its dividend by 20 per cent to compensate. But that can hardly be
the outcome the chancellor intended.

FT  17 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: A tax on the markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lamont may have thought he was pleasing voters by refraining from any net
tax increases, but his budget does little for financial markets. There has
been no interest rate cut; at Pounds 50bn next year's PSBR is considerably
larger than expected; and changes to the ACT regime - of which more below -
cast a shadow over the equity market. Perhaps the chancellor decided that by
making equities less attractive to institutions, he would encourage them to
buy gilts. That remains to be seen. What is clear is that, on the basis of
yesterday's figures, PSBR problems will dog the recovery for years to come.
The deficit will still be Pounds 30bn in 1997-98.
The risk in raising additional revenue in 1993-94 was always that of hitting
confidence in the early stages of recovery. But knowing that the pain is
simply deferred will do little for consumer spending. Despite unpopular
planned measures such as extending VAT to domestic fuel and increased
national insurance rates, the PSBR trend may force the government into
swingeing spending cuts in November.
The nagging worry is whether it would then have the courage to act.
Yesterday's effort again betrays the anxieties of a government afraid to
court unpopularity while it has a small majority. It will not do much for
the gilts market. Mr Lamont conceded the relaxation of the funding rule, but
offered no extra retail incentives nor the steeper yield curve which would
encourage banks to buy. The authorities might hope to engineer that with
another cut in base rates, but that could be hard to square with concern
over the exchange rate, especially since, despite Mr Lamont's insouciance, a
large current deficit cannot be financed indefinitely.

FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Owners succeeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement that Owners Abroad had successfully fended off the Pounds
290m bid from its rival tour operator Airtours triggered more hectic
activity in the shares as investors took stock of the situation as the dust
settled on one of the closest takeover battles in recent times.
The early afternoon announcement had been preceded by continued busy
activity in Owners shares as BZW, on behalf of Airtours, was said again to
have been bidding for stock. It was later announced that Airtours nominees
now control 8.21 per cent of Owners ordinary shares.
However, dealers also said that Owners' white knight, travel agency Thomas
Cook, owned by German travel group LTU, had also been active in the market.
One of the first trades of the day yesterday had been struck at 152 1/2 p -
the price Thomas Cook had paid to secure a large chunk of the 8.4 per cent
stake it snapped up in Owners on Monday.
The morning's activity - when 4m shares were traded - underpinned the shares
of both protaganists. However, the 3.45pm announcement of Owners' victory
prompted a roller-coaster ride in both stocks. Owners immediately tumbled 20
to 118p, before rallying to close at 126p, a fall of 12 on the day. Turnover
was moderate by recent sessions at 4.9m.
Airtours dropped 19 to 319p, then rallied to end the day 11 adrift at 327p.
The company managed to secure 43 per cent of the shares either through
nominees or by pledges of support. Sources close to Airtours were blaming a
small number of institutions for switching allegiance at the last moment.
Analysts attached more significance to the fact that Owners and Thomas Cook
had built up a strategic stake of more than 10 per cent on Monday. However,
most remained positive on both stocks in spite of the result. A combined
Airtours/Owners would have probably sparked a price war with market leader
Thomson and this prospect has now diminished. Both companies have also
reported strong bookings during the takeover battle. In addition, Owners and
Thomas Cook are now expected to cement their pre-bid plans for closer ties.

FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tax shift boosts oil shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL ISSUES, little changed ahead of the Budget, rose sharply after news that
Petroleum Revenue Tax on existing oil fields is being reduced from 75 per
cent to 50 per cent from July 1 and that tax on new fields will be
abolished.
The market's knee-jerk reaction was that the oil majors, British Petroleum
and Shell Transport, would be the main beneficiaries of the Budget changes,
closely followed by the exploration and production stocks. BP had jumped 9
to 295p by the close, with turnover totalling 5m shares. Shell, sold down to
571p early in the session, finished a net 2 higher at 580p.
The exploration and production stocks saw initial sluggish performance
transformed into good gains across the board. Enterprise Oil settled 4 ahead
at 492p and Lasmo, plagued by worries that the dividend may be cut when the
preliminary figures are published later this month, gained 5 on balance at
186p.
An analyst commented: 'Any reduction in the tax-take from the North Sea, on
existing and new fields, has got to be seen as good news for the oil
companies.' Premier Consolidated, with its raft of small marginal fields in
the North Sea, was seen as a big winner from the Budget moves. The shares
ended 2 3/4 up at 29 1/2 p.

FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities little changed by the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S equity market made a cautious response to the Budget speech, which
was still in progress at the official close of share trading last night.
Initially, equities followed the government bond sector in turning down
sharply when Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, disclosed
a substantially higher estimate of Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for
1993/94 than the City expected.
There was concern that the implications for UK pension funds of the changes
in dividend tax credits might force an overall rerating of the equity
market. Also disappointing was the chancellor's apparent coolness on
prospects for a further cut in domestic base rates at present. Later last
night some strategists predicted a setback in equities.
However, UK share prices rallied before the close of trading yesterday as
the market took aboard the wider range of Budget taxation proposals and the
FT-SE 100 Index ended the session only 3.1 down at 2,919.3.
Among the measures welcomed by the stock market were the chancellor's
reduction in North Sea Petroleum Revenue Tax, which brought strong rises in
the oil sector in late dealings. But some analysts feared that other energy
industry stocks could be hurt by the proposal to impose VAT taxes on
domestic fuel bills. Higher taxes on motor fuels, tobacco, betting and beer
had been largely expected, but the absence of any increase on spirits duty
was well received.
Some traders felt that the chancellor had been discouraging on prospects for
an immediate reduction in domestic interest rates. The lowering of the tax
rate relief on mortgages had been foreseen and there was little reaction.
Equities were drifting lower in virtually stagnant trading conditions when
Mr Lamont stood up in the House of Commons. The PSBR statement brought a
swift widening in the loss on the FT-SE 100 Index from around 2 points to
14.1, for a reading of 2,908.3. The recovery in shares came equally quickly
but there was very little trading as the market trend changed direction.
Seaq trading volume for the day fell to 492m shares. Unwillingness to take
positions in the blue chips was indicated by a sharp increase in the
percentage of non-Footsie shares to 85 per cent of the overall volume
figure. On Monday, Seaq volume of 578.1m shares had a retail value of Pounds
1.20bn.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which reflects business in a range of non-Footsie
stocks, gained ground during the chancellor's speech to close 6.9 ahead at
3,118.9.
Strategy meetings at London's securities firms last night planned for the
opening of the market today. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett said: 'We
do not think this Budget will be particularly positive for equities, unless
there is an interest rate cut.' Further gains in the North Sea stocks are
expected, however.
UK traders will also brace themselves ahead of tomorrow's policy meeting at
the Bundesbank, when some strategists expect the reduction in key interest
rates foreshadowed by the Bundesbank's recent cuts in money market
repurchase rates.
On Friday, the UK retail price index for last month will be disclosed and
this may yet set the stage for a cut in UK base rates.

FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABSENCE from the Budget speech of encouragement for hopes of a cut in UK
base rates brought a sudden retreat in the futures, towards the close of a
dull and featureless session in the derivatives market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract on the FT-SE started strongly at 2,929, up 8 from its
close on Monday, and moved swiftly forward to reach the day's high of 2,935
within half-an-hour of the opening.
There was, however, no fol-low-through buying as both leading institutions
and independent traders remained on the sidelines awaiting the outcome of
the Budget. This caused March to drift lower to trade around the 2,925 mark
for the next few hours.
It was the lack of any signs of a reduction in base rates that led to a
sharp decline in March around 20 minutes before the official close, leaving
it to test the 2,900 level. It proved to be a resistance point and the
contract bounced to finish at 2,909, a 4-point discount to the underlying
cash market, with turnover reaching a meagre 6,936 lots.
Further dealings in after-hours' trading, however, saw the contract drop
through the 2,900 barrier.
There was very little action in the traded options and volume was only
23,072 contracts. Some 8,406 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and
2,386 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Amstrad was the busiest stock option
with 2,001 lots traded.

FT  17 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bank sector firmer on
broker's upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
FOR THE second consecutive day, US stock markets moved in a narrow price
range in light trading as investors searched for a new direction, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.54 at 3,442.95. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.06 off at 451.37, while the
Nasdaq composite edged forward 0.26 to 695.47. New York SE volume, which on
Monday hit its lowest level for the year, was again light by recent
standards, at 218m shares.
After the wild fluctuations and heavy volumes of the previous few weeks,
equities yesterday appeared to have settled into a temporary pattern of
narrow price movements in thin trading. The pattern, said analysts,
indicated that in the absence of compelling new economic statistics and a
strong lead from Treasury prices, markets are searching for a new direction.
The day's only economic numbers provided little encouragement. The Commerce
Department reported that housing starts rose by 2.5 per cent in February, a
smaller increase than had been expected. Analysts, however, blamed the weak
figures on the bad weather late last month, which is likely to have hit the
construction of new homes.
The subdued trading yesterday may also have reflected reluctance among
investors and dealers to trade heavily ahead of today's consumer price index
report for February. Normally, the markets would not be overly concerned by
the CPI number, but after last week's worryingly strong producer prices
report - which sparked heavy selling of bonds and, later, equities - and
this week's increase in commodities prices, investors have become newly
sensitive to any hint that inflationary pressures may be building in the
economy.
Drug shares once again took a beating from investors worried about
government controls on pharmaceuticals prices. Merck weakened Dollars 7/8 to
Dollars 37 3/4 , Pfizer Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 60 and Schering-Plough
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 .
Banks were firmer. Citicorp rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 29 5/8 in volume of
2.3m shares and Wells Fargo by Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 108 1/4 . Both were
lifted by news that analysts at broking house Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
had raised their earnings estimates for the two banks. Elsewhere in the
sector, Chemical put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 43 1/4 .
Marion Merill Dow plunged Dollars 4 to Dollars 18 7/8 in volume of 1.8m
shares after the company warned that its first-quarter sales would be
'substantially' lower than it recorded at the same stage a year ago.
Another company hit by an unexpected profits warning was Chemical Waste,
which tumbled Dollars 2 to Dollars 17 1/4 in volume of 2.5m shares after
stating that first-quarter earnings would be flat or lower, compared to a
year ago.
Canada
TORONTO finished little changed after busy trading as a rise among forest
products issues was offset by a drop in gold shares.
The TSE 300 index eased 5.3 to 3,556.8 and declines led rises by 323 to 296
after volume of 48.4m shares.
Eight of the 14 sub-groups closed higher, with forest products ahead by 1.8
per cent. Slocan Forest advanced CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 18 5/8 . The
golds group fell 2.3 per cent as further comments by US Secretary of the
Interior Bruce Babbitt concerning American Barrick pushed the heavily
weighted stock down again, by CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 19 5/8 .

FT  17 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: European airlines begin to anticipate a
recovery - But industry prospects are uneven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European airlines are facing the prospect of further losses in 1993
following a depressed performance last year. While passenger levels have
risen slightly this year, earnings forecasts remain negative.
However, there may be some good news for airlines as the US and, to a lesser
extent, the UK economies show signs that they may be emerging from
recession.
Mr James Halstead, Swiss Bank's transport analyst, comments that the sector
looks as if it is at the bottom of the downward cycle. But he draws a
distinction between those carriers flying the transatlantic routes, such as
British Airways, and those more dependent on Europe, Lufthansa for instance.
While operators using the transatlantic routes are beginning to see a
pick-up in activity, those more dependent on continental European routes
will continue to have problems as the recession there begins to deepen, he
comments.
Mr Mark McVicar, transport analyst at NatWest Securities, is a little less
optimistic and believes that an upturn in the sector will be delayed until
1994. 'This is about the earliest time before supply and demand begin to
achieve any sort of balance,' he says.
Lufthansa surprised some observers when it blazed a trail at the beginning
of the year under a European Community liberalisation directive allowing
cheaper ticket pricing. The shares moved quickly ahead, reaching a year's
high of DM122.50 before beginning to slip back. The stock closed yesterday
at DM111.
The German carrier had not previously been induced into the pricing war
against competitors but a tough couple of years has forced its hand: Mr
Halstead comments that Lufthansa found that it had to discount following
substantial losses in 1991 and 1992.
However, Mr McVicar observes that Lufthansa, which has made efforts to
reduce its cost base, needs to go much further and quicker in that area.
'Lufthansa has said that it intends to break even by 1995/1996,' he says,
'but the equivalent cost-cutting measures were implemented by British
Airways in almost half the time.' He adds that the airline faces more
difficult industrial obstacles in, for instance, reducing staff levels than
the UK operator.
By contrast KLM is seen by many analysts to be in a good position to benefit
from any economic upturn, having made concerted efforts to cut its cost
base. After a volatile performance since the beginning of the year the
shares currently stand some 11 per cent higher.
Although, in the short term, the group's prospects are no better than most
competitors, with another net loss in earnings forecast for 1993/94, the
longer term scenario appears more secure.
Mr Richard Brakenhoff, transport analyst at Amsterdam brokers Pierson,
points to benefits which will accrue from the agreement between the
Netherlands and US over routes, the 'open skies' arrangement. Even its
commercial links with Northwest Airlines, the troubled US carrier which had
exerted a negative effect on KLM's results - the latter said last month it
was writing off its 20 per cent stake in Wings, Northwest's holding company
 -may eventually prove valuable because of the US route network.
However, KLM's route to greater profitability depends a great deal, says Mr
Brakenhoff, on whether or not it can reach an agreement with the present
members of the 'European Quality Alliance' - SAS, Austrian Airlines and
Swissair - on tighter links. At present KLM has a European market share of
just above 3 per cent, compared with Lufthansa's 14 per cent, SAS's 9.8 per
cent, 4.4 per cent for Swissair and 2 per cent for Austrian.
The outcome of these talks is uncertain, with the chairman of SAS having
already said that he does not expect discussions to lead to a merger.
Finally, SAS could benefit from economic recovery, says Mr Torben Sand,
analyst at Unibors, having realised the need for very dramatic cost
reductions and restructuring which has already resulted in staff numbers
being reduced by 3,500. But its long-term prospects are also tied to the
future shape of the 'alliance'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIGHT profit-taking ahead of the March financial year-end depressed share
prices, and the Nikkei average closed below the 18,000 mark after seven
consecutive gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 117.88 at 17,968.30, finishing below 18,000 for
the first time in three trading days. The index rose to the day's high of
18,117.09 in the morning, but was pushed down by profit-taking in the
afternoon to set a low for the session of 17,945.22.
Volume remained almost unchanged, at 350m shares against 336m. Traders said
that yesterday was the last trading day of the year for most corporate
investors, who close their books this Friday. Declines led advances by 599
to 407, with 150 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks dipped 8.89 to 1,344.71, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged
up 0.95 to 1,073.73.
Companies with close ties with Japanese railway groups gained ground after
JR East, which plans to submit its application for listing next month, held
a meeting for stock analysts on Monday. Some investors were encouraged by
reports that more analysts had attended the meeting than had been expected.
While details for the listing have yet to be decided, JR East said it
expected to target retail investors for its listing, offering a high
dividend.
Mr Graeme McDonald, an analyst at James Capel, said future profits for JR
East were dependent on its revenue from operations other than its core
business, so that most investors would be looking at the level of projected
capital expenditure. Nippon Densetsu Kogyo, a core electrical engineering
company closely linked to the JR group, advanced Y60 to Y2,250.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y1,000 to Y802,000 on profit-taking
by dealers. NTT-related shares also lost ground, with Daimei Telecom
Engineering, a telecom engineering concern, falling Y22 to Y827 and Kyowa
Exeo losing Y23 to Y975.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 83.72 to 18,992.43 in volume of 66.9m
shares. The index declined for the first time in four trading days on
small-lot selling in the afternoon. Roundup
THERE WERE some strong performances among the region's markets.
HONG KONG showed some recovery on buying by institutional investors. The
Hang Seng index rose 125.43 to 5,980.04 but turnover dropped from HKDollars
5.5bn to HKDollars 3.9bn.
Sentiment remained nervous after China's political attacks, although there
were expectations of good results from Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa,
which report tomorrow; Cheung Kong climbed 80 cents to HKDollars 21.50 and
Hutchison by 40 cents to HKDollars 15.70.
HSBC regained HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 65.50, having reported better than
expected 1992 profits after the close on Monday. Hang Seng Bank retrieved
HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars 65.
AUSTRALIA gathered momentum, encouraged by remarks from Mr Paul Keating, the
re-elected prime minister, that there was scope for a cut in official
interest rates. Some analysts said they were expecting a 1/2
percentage-point reduction in rates.
The All Ordinaries index ended 32.9 up at 1,659.3 in turnover of ADollars
281.1m. Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network acquisition of 4.98 per cent of John
Fairfax Holdings lifted the newspaper group's shares 12 cents to ADollars
1.96.
SINGAPORE closed higher following the government's announcement of changes
in the Central Provident Fund's investment rules. The Straits Times
Industrial index rallied 18.54 to 1,649.35, with some 124.6m shares traded.
The government said on Monday that it would allow CPF members to withdraw
more funds to invest in equities and unit trusts.
SEOUL weakened for the first time in four trading sessions on worries about
renewed political tension between South and North Korea, caused by
Pyongyang's withdrawal from an international nuclear pact. The composite
index retreated 7.86 to 637.87 as turnover fell Won200bn to Won300bn.
MANILA lost early gains as investors switched funds to Hong Kong, but the
composite index closed 4.13 up at 1,475.78.
NEW ZEALAND recouped Monday's losses, receiving a fillip from rises in
Telecom of 8 cents to NZDollars 2.85, a record high, and Goodman Fielder of
9 cents to NZDollars 2.13. The NZSE-40 index gained 17.66 at 1,584.69 in
turnover of some NZDollars 30.5m.
BOMBAY advanced for a second day since the market reopened following
Friday's series of bombings, in which more than 60 people died at the BSE
building. The BSE index added 38.58 at 2,459.85.
Brokers said shares rose on solid support from state-owned financial
institutions, with supply limited because trading has been restricted to one
hour and tight security had restricted the access of participants.

FT  17 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses decline as rate
prospects pall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES decided that German interest rate prospects could sustain them for
only so long, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT eased by a fraction, rate cut hopes holding equities relatively
firm against a background of disappointing, or inconclusive company news.
The DAX index slipped 4.74 to 1,697.83 in turnover down from DM6.2bn to
DM6.1bn.
Chemicals were under pressure after the string of accidents at Hoechst,
which could trigger a series of government actions to tighten regulations
and impose costly new safety controls on the industry.
MAN, the truckmaker and engineer, fell DM8 to DM297.50 on a downgrade and
sell recommendation from DB Research, which cut its 1993 earnings estimate
from DM23 to DM13 and the dividend in prospect from DM10 to DM7; Deutsche
Babcock lost Monday's gains and more, falling DM5.30 to DM156.20 as
attention shifted to the deterioration in its prospects for 1992-93.
Among carmakers, Volkswagen moved with the continental clock, rising DM5 to
DM290.50 over the official session in reaction to Monday's late news that Mr
Ignacio Lopez, VW's erstwhile recruit, would be leaving GM after all - and
falling DM2 after hours as dealers waited for the results of a VW press
conference, and mused that Mr Lopez, a tough cost cutter in the US, might
find German conditions less to his liking.
Meanwhile, Mr Detlev Klug at B Metzler in Frankfurt offered a cautionary
word about equity prospects after Thursday's Bundesbank meeting. Relative
strength indicators were looking toppy, he said, a limited rate cut from
Buba could be seen as solidarity pact window dressing, and the expiry of
options contracts on Friday could exaggerate any adverse reaction.
MILAN was battered by a sharp fall in Olivetti which followed Monday's news
of a L900bn rights issue. After an early suspension on a 14 per cent drop,
the shares closed L377, or 17 per cent lower at L1,825. This was reflected
in the Comit index which finished 6.00 weaker at 502.42.
Mr Carlo de Benedetti has said that the capital increase is needed to help
the group take advantage of a possible recovery in the European computer
market, where it is perceived to have an advantage over IBM and Compaq
because of the strength of the dollar.
Some analysts commented that Olivetti had made efforts already to
restructure and streamline its business into sector areas with the best
growth opportunities, such as telecommunications and computer notebooks.
NatWest Securities in London said that the convertible bonds offered as a
partial alternative to conventional equity looked attractive: they will be
issued at L1,000, and carry a coupon of between 6 and 8 per cent.
Olivetti's parent company, Cir, which announced a loss of L540bn in 1992,
also eased on the news, closing down L119 at L1,050 while Cofide, another of
Mr De Benedetti's companies, was off L122 at L1,138.
The Olivetti news weighed on other stocks which, observers believe may make
a rights issue; Fiat, for instance, lost L225 to L5,560.
PARIS remained depressed with a further fall in the CAC-40 index of 10.78 to
1,975.25 as turnover stayed low at FFr2.3bn.
There was activity in Moulinex, which began the week with a decline of some
6.5 per cent and followed yesterday with another fall of FFr6.80, or 7 per
cent to FFr90.70. Some analysts remarked that there had been reports
yesterday that the group had clarified its shareholding structure,
suggesting that it could proceed with a rights issue. The share price had
risen to a year's high of FFr107 on takeover speculation.
MADRID got the better January inflation figures it expected and sold, the
general index falling 2.23 to 235.50.
STOCKHOLM staged a modest rally on lower domestic interest rates as the
Affarsvarlden general index gained 17.7 to 1,017.8, its first gain in five
trading days. Turnover improved to SKr558m from Monday's SKr532m.
Ericsson, the telecommunications group, remained the market's most active
issue as the B shares rose SKr5 to SKr240 in turnover of some SKr90m.
ISTANBUL decided that the results of some 40 companies announced yesterday
had failed to match expectations, and the market index closed 75.43 lower at
5,716.82.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling firms on UK Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POUND gained 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as dealers absorbed
the message from the UK chancellor that the current level of UK base rates
was 'consistent with the achievements of the government's inflation
objectives', writes James Blitz.
In the run-up to yesterday's Budget statement, sterling rose against the
German currency from around DM2.3900 at 8.30am to DM2.4050 shortly before
the chancellor spoke in the House of Commons.
The stronger sentiment towards the pound was based on the correct impression
that the chancellor would not ease monetary policy further in his annual
budget statement.
His announcement that the projected Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for
1994/95 had been raised to Pounds 50bn triggered a  1/2 pfennig loss for the
pound at one stage of the speech.
However, news of the chancellor's measures to tighten fiscal policy over the
next few years helped to boost confidence in sterling on both currency and
fixed income markets. The pound closed in London at DM2.4025, up 2 pfennigs
on the day. At lunchtime in the US, the UK currency was trading higher at
DM2.4045.
Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said
yesterday's budget statement would consolidate the favourable sentiment
towards sterling seen in recent weeks.
He said there were already signs that the UK economy was recovering, and the
chancellor's promise to tighten fiscal policy over the next few years would
be a further attraction for investors. But he also felt that the budget
proposals themselves were unlikely to push the currency up very far.
In Europe, the immediate outlook for the European exchange rate mechanism
remained uncertain. The Bundesbank's decision not to change the interest
rate at which it lends short term funds to German commercial banks added to
ERM tensions.
Market participants appeared to believe that the Bundesbank would cut its
official Lombard and discount rates by 50 basis points at tomorrow's council
meeting. However, yesterday's decision to offer a fixed rate repo at the
unchanged rate of 8.25 per cent disappointed some dealers.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, expressed
surprise that the market was so optimistic about an official rate cut
following the recent conclusion of the Solidarity Pact talks between the
German government and opposition.
'The pact actually revises up the budget deficit forecast for 1995 and there
is little reason for the Bundesbank to be optimistic,' he said.
At least one trader said the Bank of France was subtly buying its currency
to staunch selling. The franc finished at FFr3.4000 to the D-Mark, having
been as low as FFr3.4043 on Monday.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Repo unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WERE strong expect-ations yesterday that the Bundesbank would cut
official rates at its council meeting this week, even though the central
bank left the rate at which it offers weekly funds to commercial banks
unchanged, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank announced that it would be setting a fixed rate repurchase
tender at 8.25 per cent, unaltered from the rate set two Fridays ago. The
move caused some disappointment in money markets, and the June Euromark
contract slipped 2 basis points to finish at 93.22.
However, some dealers suggested that the unchanged repo rate was largely
neutral and that there had recently been signs of a willingness among
Bundesbank council members to ease policy. The predominance of the bulls in
the market was seen by the fact that three-month D-Marks hovered at around
7.75 per cent, some 50 basis points below the current repo rate level.
Whatever the outlook for official policy, conditions in the German money
market remained tight as dealers continued to adjust to the recent changes
in the Bundesbank's minimum reserve requirements.
Call money was quoted as high as the Lombard rate level of 9 per cent. It
came down to about 8.67 per cent in the afternoon following comments from Mr
Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank council member, who said that the German
central bank would aim to calm markets via the allocation of its securities
repurchase funds today.
In the sterling cash market, three-month money ended unchanged at 5 15/16
per cent after the UK chancellor made no alteration to UK base rates in his
budget statement.
Yesterday morning, there was speculation that Mr Lamont would ease UK
interest rates. Shortly before Mr Lamont spoke, three-month money was bid
down to around 5 7/8 per cent by speculators prepared to take a bet on a
cut. The March short sterling contract, which expires today, was also
trading at 94.10 shortly before the budget statement.
After the speech, the March contract fell steeply to 93.95, down 12 basis
points on the day. The sharp rise in the level of three-month sterling may
also have been due to the expectation that there will be large shortages in
the discount market later this week.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italy tries to limit foot and
mouth restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN agriculture and health authorities were yesterday attempting to
limit the scope of restrictions imposed with effect from today by the
European Community on the export of live cattle, sheep and pigs as well as
processed meats following the discovery of an outbreak of foot and mouth
disease.
The outbreak occurred in the southern region of Basilicata but has spread to
four other provinces including to important cattle centres in the Veneto.
Livestock exports earn little more than L15bn (Pounds 6.5m) a year; but if
restrictions on processed meats (hams, salamis etc) are extended beyond the
March 31 deadline the damage could being serious as these earn L400bn a
year.
The main effect is already being felt in the domestic market. Since the
outbreak was first discovered on March 10 3,921 animals have been
slaughtered, including 2,000 sheep, 1,121 cattle and 652 pigs. The net loss
is put at about L2.5bn.
But at Monday's market at Modena in northern Italy, the most important in
the country, there were fears the eventual losses could be high. In
particular it was feared that lamb being reared for Easter would be badly
affected. Farmers also said they feared the EC would take a tough line and
use the outbreak of the disease as an excuse to force Italy to reduce its
dairy herd in order to conform to the community's new milk quotas. Italy
risks having to kill more than 400,000 head of cattle to conform with the
quotas; and one scheme floated was to export this quantity to Albania as aid
under an EC grant.
The cause of the outbreak has still not been formally identified. However,
magistrates are thought to be investigating purchases of cattle from
Croatia. They were shipped via Greece through Italy's southern port of Bari.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP steps up Chinese
exploration efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BROKEN HILL Proprietary, the Australian steel and resources giant, is
stepping up its involvement in China with new explorations ventures in oil
and minerals. But its chairman, Mr Brian Loton, says the company is
proceeding cautiously in a complex market.
Speaking in Beijing at the weekend, Mr Loton said BHP's approach to China
would be 'practical and hard-nosed', but at the same it recognised the
growth of new opportunities now that the country was 'opening up'.
The BHP chairman, who has tended to be regarded by company insiders as a
'China-sceptic', was visiting Beijing to assess an expanding range of
options for BHP in both the resources and oil and gas sectors. He was
received by Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, one of the Chinese leaders responsible
for economic management, and officials of the Ministry of Metallurgical
Industries.
Mr Loton said that representatives of BHP Petroleum would be visiting China
later this month to examine possible involvement in exploration of the vast
Tarim basin in the north-west, which has recently been opened to foreign
companies and may have reserves to match those of Saudi Arabia. He stressed,
however, that BHP on its own did not have the resources necessary to explore
China's desert wastes. This indicated that BHP might join forces with an oil
major in a Tarim basin venture.
BHP's experiences looking for oil in China had not been encouraging, Mr
Loton noted. It had, for example, drilled 23 dry wells in the Yellow Sea and
Pearl River delta in a consortium with British Petroleum. He added,
nevertheless, that these setbacks had 'not dimmed our enthusiasm,' and that
BHP was either actively engaged in exploration or was evaluating
opportunities in several offshore areas. These included the Bohai Gulf in
northern Chinese waters, the South China Sea and areas off Hainan island in
the south. BHP was also expected to bid for blocks in the East China Sea off
Shanghai in June.
The company was also spending about ADollars 4m to evaluate a lead/zinc
prospect in Sichuan province in China's centre-west. This venture marks
something of a first for a foreign company in the strategic minerals and
metals area.
China has tended to guard jealously its minerals and onshore oil and gas
resources from foreign involvement, but with demands from the leadership for
speedier economic development, officials are now beginning actively to seek
assistance abroad.
Mr Loton said that his company had no immediate plans for further minerals
exploration ventures, but he also noted that China recognised the expertise
of companies like BHP in both looking for and exploiting mineral deposits.
China has barely scratched the surface of its minerals assets across a vast
country. An obsession with gold - in the past two decades about 70 per cent
of China's exploration resources were devoted to looking for the metal - has
been a serious drag on overall minerals development.
BHP's chairman and his fellow executives were bullish about the company's
iron ore sales to China, which they expected would rise by about 10 per cent
to some 5m tonnes in 1993. The sales are being driven by the extraordinary
growth in the Chinese economy in the past year of 12.8 per cent, well up on
revised growth targets of 9 per cent.
China produced 78m tonnes of steel last year, making it the world's number
three producer. It is aiming for 100m tonnes a year by 2000, which
represents continuing good news for BHP and other Australian iron ore
suppliers.

New York raw SUGAR prices were broadly lower by midsession on sentiment that
Monday's sharp rise might have been overdone. The market, already poised for
an advance after Friday's firm close, soared on news that Cuba's crop and
mills might have been damaged by the weekend storm which swept up the
eastern US. But analysts said uncertainty about the extent of the damage was
paring the gains. New York COFFEE prices were down at mid-day, weighed down
by lack of news in the physical market, large consumer stocks and little
chance of renewed ICO export quotas. GOLD edged ahead on the London bullion
market, but was meeting stiff resistance at Dollars 330 a troy ounce on
Comex at midday. London dealers said gold still had to overcome downward
pressure from producer sales with the South African rand gold price
approaching record levels. Both PLATINUM and PALLADIUM were weighed down in
London by Japanese selling as the dollar slumped against the yen. Compiled

FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price surge spells danger for
timber industry - Canadian producers fear that users may turn to substitutes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN AS Canada's timber industry celebrates surging prices for its products,
worries are growing that it will soon be caught in the same worldwide
squeeze on supplies that has driven lumber prices to record levels.
For the moment the jump in prices is a welcome ray of light in an otherwise
gloomy sector. The strong lumber business has helped integrated forestry
companies to offset their losses on pulp and newsprint and other types of
paper. Specialised lumber producers are basking in record profits.
According to Madison's Canadian Lumber Reporter, an industry newsletter,
standard spruce, pine and fir two-by-four planks are selling this week for
USDollars 460 per thousand board feet in the US, up from Dollars 305 in
mid-January and Dollars 235 a year ago. Prices are also sharply higher in
Japan, the biggest market for British Columbia's coastal saw mills.
Returns to Canadian producers have been further boosted by a 12 per cent
decline in the Canadian dollar since November 1991.
A recovery in housing starts and other construction has been the traditional
signal for a run-up in lumber prices. But the present price explosion owes
as much to nervousness about future supplies of timber as to rising
consumption. Indeed, some producers fear that prices are now so high that
homebuilders and other users may turn to substitutes such as steel, cement
and plastics.
Supply concerns in the US are centred on the large tracts of forest in
Oregon and Washington that the federal government has withdrawn from logging
to protect the northern spotted owl and other threatened species.
Across the Pacific, Japanese buyers have been forced to broaden their
horizons as a result of restricted supplies from south-east Asia and
disruption of exports from Russia.
The Canadians have rushed to fill the gaps. Canadian lumber exports to the
US will jump by 1.2bn board ft this year to a near-record 14.4bn, according
to a study published in Madison's by Mr Doug Smyth, research director of the
Canadian branch of the International Woodworkers of America union.
One reason for the recent surge in prices, however, is that US buyers can no
longer rely on Canada to meet the full shortfall in domestic supplies. Many
mills north of the border are more eager these days to widen the market for
value-added, finished lumber in Japan and Europe, rather than increase their
share of the market for lower-margin, commodity-grade products to the US.
The British Columbia coastal industry, which has the best quality trees but
also high transport and cutting costs, is already geared almost entirely for
offshore markets, mainly Japan and Europe, but increasingly Taiwan and
China. Some producers in the interior of the province, who in the past have
shipped almost exclusively to the US, are also becoming more active in the
Japanese market.
Mr Brian McCloy, vice-president of the BC Council of Forest Industries,
estimates that 10 to 15 per cent of interior lumber is now shipped overseas.
Canadian supplies are starting to be threatened however, by the same
environmental pressures that have slashed harvesting in the north-west US.
Mr John Burch, general manager for marketing at Primex Forest Products in
Delta, BC, predicts 'one or two major closures' among British Columbian saw
mills over the next few years as a result of tightening land-use curbs.
Weldwood of Canada last week announced the closure of a saw mill at Williams
Lake because of timber supply curbs. Timber shortages have already prevented
some interior mills from adding extra shifts to meet growing US demand.
The pressures come from various sources. There are no spotted owls in
Canada, but environmentalists are demanding wider protection for the marbled
murrelet, a small sea bird that they claim nests in old-growth forests. The
murrelet has already been listed as a threatened species in the US.
Forestry companies have also drawn fire for 'clear-cut' logging, which has
denuded some of the most scenic parts of the province.
The BC government has pledged to double - from 6 per cent to 12 per cent -
the land set aside for parks and wilderness areas. The Committee on
Resources and the Environment, headed by a former provincial ombudsman, was
set up last year to allocate land for commercial forests and other uses. It
has already appointed three land-use committees to draw lines on the map of
Vancouver Island, the Cariboo Mts in the east-central part of the province
and the West Kootenays in the south-east.
Meanwhile, the timber companies are nervously watching a myriad of
lower-profile initiatives, such as proposals to ban logging along river
banks and to increase the bio-diversity of existing forests. These proposals
threaten not just to put trees out of bounds for commercial logging, but
also to push up costs by impeding access of men and machinery to the forests
that can be cut.
An official at MacMillan Bloedel, the biggest coastal lumber producer, says
'these things are hurting us even more than the large-scale set-asides'.
Canada's lumber industry senses however, that it has one advantage over its
US counterpart in the fight against tightening environmental laws.
About 40 per cent of the trees in Washington and Oregon are owned by the US
federal government, but in Canada, forests are mostly under the control of
the provinces - 95 per cent, in the case of British Columbia. Industry
leaders hope that provincial governments will be more receptive than remote
federal bureaucrats to arguments that curbs on logging will lead to heavy
job losses and the devastation of some small communities. They note that
forestry is the biggest contributor to the British Columbia economy, while
it ranks only third in Washington state (after aerospace and farming).
MacMillan Bloedel contends that a 10 per cent reduction in the British
Columbian timber harvest would put 50,000 people out of work and add
CDollars 750m (USDollars 600m) a year to the provincial budget deficit.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 5 per cent cost added to US
housebuilding

<TEXT>
The squeeze on timber harvesting and the resulting surge in lumber prices
has added as much as 5 per cent to the cost of building a new home in the
US, a development that is only partially offset by falling mortgage rates
and rising new home demand, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
The rocketing cost of lumber has prompted the influential National
Association of Home Builders, a 160,000-member organisation, to ask
President Bill Clinton to convene a meeting between US logging and
environmental interests. Mr Clinton has asked Vice President Al Gore to
organise the meeting.
Mr Michael Carliner, chief economist for the home builders' group, said a 90
per cent rise in lumber prices since October had increased the cost of
building a 2,000 square foot home that might sell for Dollars 120,000 by
about Dollars 4,500. It takes an estimated 15,000 board feet of lumber to
build an average home, with wood products used for flooring and trim as well
as framing. The average price for 1,000 board feet of a mixture of lumber
grades, as reported by the Random Lengths Lumber service, was Dollars 474
last week, up from Dollars 249 in October.
'The market has probably overshot its mark, with a lot of panic buying,'
said Mr Carliner. 'Lumber producers who own their own forest land may be
holding product off the market waiting for higher prices.'
Timber sales from the south-eastern US are rising to fill the supply gap,
but analysts say the south is also facing restrictions because of the
endangered species act and a broader definition of wetlands.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME stocks top 3m-tonne mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALS MARKETS received a psychological battering yesterday when another
huge rise in London Metal Exchange stocks took the total above 3m tonnes for
the first time.
Even though most aluminium, lead, nickel, tin and zinc producers were
unprofitable at present, metal prices were unlikely to recover substantially
with so much highly-visible stock weighing down the market, analysts
suggested.
LME stock levels were 'indicative of the situation in the physical markets.
Economic recovery in the US is being offset by weakness in Germany and
Japan,' said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven
Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. He recalled that Japan was the
second most important consumer of all base metals except for nickel, of
which it was the biggest consumer. Germany was the third-largest consumer of
all six base metals traded on the LME.
However, Mr Nick Moore, metals analyst at Ord Minnett, the Westpac
subsidiary, pointed out that there were now about 325 LME-authorised
warehouses world-wide compared with only 16, all in Europe, in 1982. This
had encouraged producers and consumers to move their stock on to the LME so
not all of the metal was readily available.
Nevertheless, Billiton's Mr MacMillan said that total western world stocks -
not just those in LME warehouses - of aluminium and nickel were at
'horrendous' levels and those of tin and zinc were heading fast in that
direction. Copper and lead stocks were now 'uncomfortably high'.
Mr MacMillan said: 'We need a return to synchronised growth in the major
industrialised economies before there is any sustained recovery in metals
demand - and there is not much chance of that before the year end.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia faces mine crisis
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOLIVIA'S MINING industry, which has only just begun to recover from the
market crash caused by the collapse of the International Tin Council's
buffer stock operation in 1985, is bracing itself for a second shock.
Both the private and public sectors have already suffered a depressing
opening to the new year. Lithco pulled out of a Dollars 1.5bn deal with the
Bolivian government in January. Shortly afterwards Jordex Resources withdrew
after selling its majority stake in Minera Tiwanacu. Some private mining
concerns, including Britain's RTZ are said to be considering slimming down
their presence in Bolivia.
Two existing joint ventures between Comibol, the state mining corporation,
Cominesa and a subsidiary of Brazil's Paranapanema are still inoperable
because of union opposition. The government's continuing reluctance to
tackle the unions means further joint venture contracts are likely to be
stalled before the June general elections.
This already fragile situation is complicated by the fall in international
prices for zinc, which now tops Bolivia's mining production, and also gold,
silver, wolfram and antimony. Bolivian mining minister Mr Alvaro Rejas
believes the industry is facing a crisis similar to that caused by the
collapse of tin prices in 1985, when some 23,000 state miners were made
redundant.

supply

LONG-DATED gilts fell by a point, while the short end of the market dropped
half a point, following disappointment over Chancellor Norman Lamont's
budget.
The main worry in the gilts market currently is supply, which has increased
sharply due to the government's higher funding needs as a result of economic
recession.
On this issue, there was nothing to cheer the market. The chancellor
announced a public sector borrowing requirement for this year of Pounds
35bn, in line with expectations. But the Pounds 50bn figure given for the
financial year 1993-94 was higher than dealers had hoped.
'The market was disappointed by the lack of action on next year's PSBR,'
said Mr Simon Briscoe, a gilts analyst at Greenwell Montagu, adding that
some traders had been looking for a reduction to around Pounds 45bn.
The other big disappointment was that only a slight change was made to
funding rules in the gilts market.
The chancellor announced that banks' and building societies' purchases of
gilts will now count towards funding.
These have amounted to an estimated Pounds 4bn to Pounds 6bn this year, but
could fall back again, and are not expected to make a substantial impact on
gilts funding needs. Some traders had hoped that Treasury bills and foreign
currency debt would be included.
An announcement by the Bank of England that the frequency of gilt auctions
would be increased to roughly monthly intervals, and the size increased to
between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn per auction, was in line with
expectations.
The rest of the news in the budget was bypassed by the gilts market. 'There
was neither good nor bad news on inflation, and growth forecasts were in
line with expectations,' one analyst said.
On Liffe, the June long gilts contract ended more than 1 1/4 points down at
105 9/16 .
ELSEWHERE in Europe, bond markets opened lower as traders pondered the
German solidarity package and its implications for German finances, but
recovered somewhat to end only slightly lower on the day. German bond prices
slipped  1/4 point ahead of tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting, partially
reversing gains made earlier in the week, while French bond prices edged
down as the franc came under pressure.
US TREASURY issues firmed across the board after a hesitant start yesterday,
with prices boosted by a weaker-than-expected housing report, and in the
afternoon by the Federal Reserve's outright purchase of coupons.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 103
1/4 , yielding 6.865 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also firmer, up  1/8 at 99 3/4 , to yield 3.997 per cent.
Prices firmed at the short end in early trading after the Commerce
Department reported that housing starts gained 2.5 per cent in February.
While shorter-dated prices edged higher, at the long end the market remained
flat, with investors reluctant to commit themselves at the long end ahead of
today's important consumer prices report for February.
But the long end recovered later in the day after the Fed unexpectedly
bought coupons outright to address a seasonal need to add reserves to the
banking system.
THE Luxembourg Treasury is studying the possibility of issuing Luxembourg
franc government bonds and creating a liquid secondary market in the paper,
Reuter reports.
Unlike neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg does not have a pressing need to
issue debt paper as its debt is negligible by European Community standards.
But issuing government debt paper, notably a benchmark bond, would enhance
the market, the Luxembourg Treasury said.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Investors spend a day on the sidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were few new issues in the international bond market yesterday as
investors retreated to the sidelines ahead of the UK budget and the
Bundesbank's council meeting tomorrow.
The African Development Bank is expected to launch a Dollars 500m Eurobond
issue in the next few days, via Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers.
Otherwise, syndicate managers said that it was unlikely that there would be
many more new issues this week.
Two foreign borrowers, the Bank for Dutch Municipalities, and SNCF, the
French railway, tapped the Swiss franc market for SFr150m and SFr300m
respectively.
Both issues have a maturity of eight years, which syndicate managers said
suited the requirements of the borrowers and met demand from investors for
paper in a relatively neglected area of the Swiss yield curve.
They noted that most of the recent Swiss franc issues had been either in the
five-year or 10-year area, but that there had not been much in between. Both
issues were trading within fees in mid-afternoon.
Meanwhile, KfW International Finance's DM1.5bn 10-year Eurobond issue,
launched on Monday, was priced at 99.30 to yield 15 basis points over the 7
1/8 per cent bund due December 2003, in the middle of the indicated range of
14 to 16 basis points.
The spread was broadly unchanged when the bonds were freed to trade.
But, as the market had expected, the yield spread on Denmark's
aggressively-priced five-year Eurobond issue widened to around 15 basis
points over the series 105 of medium-term German government bonds from 10
basis points at the launch on Monday.

THE Asian Development Bank (ADB) yesterday launched its first
yen-denominated bond issue in the so-called 'dragon bond' market which is
targeted at non-Japanese investors in Asia.
Daiwa Singapore, lead manager, said the Y30bn five-year issue was priced at

points above the 106th Japanese government bond, also a five-year issue. The
bonds will be listed in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
The dragon bond market has been pioneered by the ADB to develop Asia's

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan's rush for corporate
paper provokes reform - Barriers are coming down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE weakness of the Tokyo stock market and the reluctance of Japanese banks
to lend have forced Japanese industry to turn to the domestic corporate bond
market which, until recently, has been constrained by regulation,
restrictive market practices and conservative investors.
The pace of reform has been quickened by the rising number of companies
dipping into the corporate bond market, says Mr Masaaki Nogawa, head of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's finance department.
With redemptions of over Y10,000bn (Dollars 84.7bn) worth of equity-linked
bonds expected in the year to March 1994, Y5,000bn is expected to be raised
through the straight bond market.
But the surge in corporate bond issues has flushed out inefficiencies in the
secondary market. Traders and issuers blame structural barriers. The lack of
a centralised settlement system has limited trading, and reporting
requirements imposed by the Bank of Japan on borrowing and lending bonds has
restricted market-making by securities houses.
The lack of a proper government bond yield curve has given little incentive
to use corporate bonds as hedging or arbitrage instruments against
government bonds. Mr Nogawa points out that active trading on the government
bond market is almost limited to the benchmark bond.
But the barriers also seem to stem from attitudes of market participants.
For most institutional investors, corporate bonds are still instruments kept
until maturity.
The lack of interest among investors has resulted in a situation where the
bid, or buying price, of one securities house would sometimes be placed
higher than the offer, or the selling price, at another house.
For many Japanese brokers, which are not used to taking risks on their own
capital, market-making is still a new concept. While eight houses -
including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Nomura Securities, Daiwa
Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - now quote two-way
prices through trading screens, sparse investor interest has led to
distorted prices.
Some issuers blame the inconsistent offering methods in the primary market
for the lack of investor support. Mr Nogawa at NTT says pricing on the
primary market is still not transparent.
Traditionally, domestic corporate bonds were issued using the so-called
'proposal' method, under which underwriting is awarded to the securities
house with the most competitive bid. Intense competition for underwriting
contracts led to unrealistic offering prices. To break from such practices,
NTT appointed Morgan Stanley Japan, along with Nomura, as lead managers of
its issue. 'We needed innovation,' says Mr Nogawa.
NTT has since led the way in changing the market by gaining approval for
trading on the secondary market in the offering period. Former practice
required investors to hold bonds until the offering period was over, leaving
them vulnerable to market movements.
From April, the ministry of finance will remove other barriers deterring
companies from the domestic bond market.
Limits on the amount that can be issued are due to be eliminated. Also, the
commission-bank system, under which every issue needs a commercial bank
acting as an agent representing investors, will be scaled back. Companies
say the ministry's move is a start, but it will probably take further time
for the ministry to address other issues.
In April there will also be an initial easing of barriers between the
banking and securities industries. Securities houses are bracing themselves
for the entrance into the corporate bond market of affiliates of long-term
credit banks, such as IBJ. Mr Mikio Fujii, of Nomura's fixed-income
department, puts on a brave face, saying the increase of business will
activate the market.
But an official at a leading US house is pessimistic. 'If the banks go for
market share, as they have in the past, the market could collapse,' he says.

THE Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) expects to report a Y240m (Dollars 2m)
loss for the year ending March, after a Y1m profit a year earlier, Reuter
reports from Osaka.
It will be the exchange's first loss in 10 years.
The OSE blamed slow stock futures trading following restrictions and the
overall decline in stock markets.
Members' fees, including commissions to the OSE, is expected to fall to
Y3.2bn in the six months ending March, from Y4.6bn in the first half of the
year.
Revenue from members' fees for the coming year is projected to decline 18.7
per cent to Y6.35bn.
The exchange is also having to face the cost of developing a new
trade-weighted average stock futures contract, scheduled to replace the
average Nikkei 225 next year.
The development cost for the first year is Y1.33bn in the budget for the
next year, which begins on April 1, the OSE said.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hurricane claims cost GIO at
least Dollars 15bn

<TEXT>
GIO Australia, the privatised Australian insurance group, yesterday blamed
disappointing investment returns, hurricane claims and rationalisation costs
for a disappointing net profit of ADollars 43m (USDollars 30.7m) for the six
months to December.
GIO, which was floated by the New South Wales state government in July, said
it made an operating profit of ADollars 73m on turnover of ADollars 990m.
The group declared an initial interim dividend of 7 cents, fully-franked.
The group gave no comparative figures for last year's first half, when it
was in government ownership. It re-ported a ADollars 117m net profit for the
12 months to June, up 23 per cent on the previous year.
Mr Bill Jocelyn, managing director, said losses from Hurricane Andrew, which
hit Florida last year, were estimated at between USDollars 15bn and
USDollars 18bn, compared with an earlier estimate of USDollars 8bn.
The result includes a loss of ADollars 7m caused by hurricane-related claims
against SIO, the Victorian state insurance office, which was acquired by GIO
last year. GIO said the full cost of integrating SIO during the half was
ADollars 10.3m.
Jennings, the Australian homebuilder, said its bankers would convert
ADollars 27m of bank debt into equity, on top of the ADollars 63m converted
into a 39 per cent equity stake last August, Reuter reports from Melbourne.
Jennings, 43 per cent owned by Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand forestry
and energy group, said the bankers would receive non-voting preference
shares on the additional ADollars 27m.
The company earlier reported attributable losses of ADollars 23.05m for the
six months to December 31, compared with losses of ADollars 27.96m a year
earlier. Net operating profits totalled ADollars 181,000, down from ADollars
3.73m. The company again paid no dividend.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mr Sim blasts his way into the
US market - Kieran Cooke charts the eventual success of a man whose dream
machine was a flop
</HEADLINE>

THEY call him the Bill Gates of Singapore. Mr Sim Wong Hoo started a company
called Creative Technology just over 10 years ago. Computer skills, bright
ideas and a lot of persistence have made Creative one of the stars of the
computer scene, not just in Singapore but also in the US.
In August, Creative was listed on the Nasdaq over-the-counter exchange in
the US. While not in the same league as Mr Gates's Microsoft, Mr Sim's
company has taken one segment of the computer market by storm.
Creative's shares, offered at USDollars 12, shot up to nearly Dollars 40 at
one stage and now trade in the upper Dollars 20s range - valuing Creative at
Dollars 1.2bn. In the second half of 1992, Creative reported net income of
Dollars 32.6m on revenues of Dollars 129.7m - up from Dollars 9.1m and
Dollars 33.3m respectively in the corresponding period in 1991.
Creative's main product is Sound Blaster, a hardware-software package which
enables computers to play music, mimic a wide range of sounds, and
synthesise the human voice. First marketed in the US in late 1989, nearly 3m
Sound Blasters have now been sold.
Creative is run from the seventh floor of an industrial estate block in
Singapore. A local workforce of 550 puts together more than 200,000 pieces
of computer equipment each month.
Mr Sim, at 37, is a local hero. Singapore is well-known for its technocrats
and its managers, but entrepreneurs like Mr Sim are thin on the ground in
what is a tightly-regulated and controlled business environment.
'There were times when no one wanted to know us. Getting venture capital was
impossible,' he says. All that has changed. A Singapore state company has a
6.5 per cent share in Creative. Mr Sim and two friends who founded the
company control 70 per cent.
Mr Sim studied electronics but has no formal computer training. After
military service in Singapore, he worked as as assistant electronics
engineer for a local oil company and found he enjoyed computer programming
and design work.
'By the early 1980s I'd decided to set up my own business. I knew I was good
at creating things but didn't really have any focus. I was also very shy,
and business did not appeal to me.'
An early foray into computer teaching turned sour when a partner ran off
with the money. In 1981, Creative Technology was founded, mainly to carry
out various software contracts in Singapore.
'We put an ad in a local newspaper 'We are very hungry - so call us.' Our
initial capital was only SDollars 10,000 (USDollars 6,000).' Design work
continued. By 1984, Creative had gathered enough expertise to design what
was Singapore's first home-grown computer. Mr Sim insists he did not clone
products.
'We wanted to make an original. Ours was the first computer which was able
to 'talk' in Chinese.' But it was not a success. Sales barely covered costs.
Creative had no money for marketing.
The same thing happened to what Mr Sim calls the 'dream machine' - another
computer launched in 1986 which had both Chinese and English voices, plus
graphics and a sound board.
'We thought the dream machine would sell like hot cakes. It didn't. It was
ahead of its time. It had so many features that it took two hours just to do
the sales pitch. People would ask us, 'why does your computer talk? or why
does it have Chinese?' China might have been interested but then it had no
money to buy such products. Locally we had very little support. So we had to
start again.'
Mr Sim and his colleagues made some radical decisions. 'We threw away the
voice and languages. Music is universal. We started selling computer sound
boards - music for the masses. We found we could earn the same margin on a
sound board as on a complete PC.' With sounds for computer games, the Game
Blaster became a popular product.
In 1988, Mr Sim left for the US. 'That's where the computer market is. I
told my family that if I did not sell 20,000 sound boards in the US I would
not come back.'
Penetrating the distribution system in the US is crucial. 'I would beg
distributors to give me their time. I kept knocking on doors. I was willing
to add in all sorts of features or modify the sound boards for them.'
Persistence paid off. At a computer exhibition in Las Vegas in late 1989,
Creative was taking a trade order every three minutes. A year later, it was
exporting 10,000 sound boards per month from Singapore.
Creative has several rivals, some of which, according to Mr Sim, have cloned
Creative's products. Similar operations have started in Singapore. But
Creative says it now has 60 per cent of a market which is growing by more
than 30 per cent per year.
Creative has introduced other products, some of which it it trying to
persuade PC manufacturers to incorporate into their machines, rather than
selling them as accessories.
Creative has moved into multi-media computers, which combine pictures, text
and high-quality sound. Creative now sells a multi-media package
manufactured in conjunction with Matsushita of Japan which incorporates a
Sound Blaster, a compact disc player adapted for the computer and software
disks.
There is also a Video Blaster which allows a user to watch television on a
computer.
Many of these products date back to Mr Sim's 1986 dream machine. That
computer's functions, particularly its Chinese/English abilities, are now
being resurrected with an eye to the fast-growing China market. Late last
year, Creative formed a joint venture with a Beijing company. Creative's
Chinese software is already being used in schools in Singapore.
Mr Sim has also moved closer to Mr Gates. Creative is now developing, along
with Microsoft, various digital video software.

Santos to record

SANTOS, the Australian energy group, announced a 40 per cent increase in net
profit to a record ADollars 163m (USDollars 116m) for the year to the end of
December, on turnover up 5 per cent to ADollars 690m.
However, the group said this figure was reduced to ADollars 113m after
abnormal losses of ADollars 60m, mainly reflecting a ADollars 27.5m
write-down in the carrying value of US oil and gas reserves and a ADollars
23m unrealised foreign exchange loss caused by the depreciation of the
Australian dollar against the US dollar.
In the previous year, Santos recorded a net loss of ADollars 111m year after
abnormal losses of ADollars 223m, including a ADollars 154m write-down
against unsuccessful exploration in permit areas in the Timor Sea, between
Australia and Indonesia.
The group increased the final dividend by 1 cent a share to 11 cents,
fully-franked, making a total of 21 cents, compared with 19 cents in the
previous year. Santos shares closed 13 cents higher at ADollars 3.32 on the
Australian Stock Exchange.
Santos attributed the profit improvement to higher production and sales,
lower financing costs caused by falling interest rates, higher depreciation
charges following increased production, and an increase in the value of oil
and gas stocks.
The group said its net operating cash-flow had risen 41 per cent to ADollars
409m, which would enable it 'to continue to capitalise on strategic
opportunities which emerge in the Australian and international oil and gas
markets'.
In recent months, Santos has announced acquisitions totalling over ADollars
338m, including a 19.9 per cent stake in Sagasco Holdings and the purchase
of the upstream oil and gas interests of Australian Gas Light.
Santos said it intended to acquire further shares in Sagasco, with the
'ultimate objective' of obtaining control, subject to a court challenge by
the Trade Practices Commission, the competition regulator.
The group said it expected production to increase by 6.1 per cent to a
record 36.7m barrels of oil equivalent in the current year, aided by the AGL
purchase and development in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin in South Australia.
'Overall, Santos' total oil production from all regions in 1993 is forecast
to be 10.7m barrels,' the group said.

SUMITOMO Trust &amp; Banking, the leading Japanese trust bank, plans to apply to
set up a subsidiary to deal in securities in the year starting on April 1,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The bank said the subsidiary would be capitalised at about Y10bn (Dollars
84m) and have some 30 staff.
Financial reforms allowing banks and brokerages to enter each other's
business through subsidiaries take effect in April.
The securities businesses that a bank's subsidiaries will be allowed to
engage in do not initially include stockbroking. Two Japanese long-term
credit banks - the Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan - have already announced that they would apply to the ministry of
finance to set up securities subsidiaries soon after the reforms took
effect.
The Norinchukin Bank, the central body for agricultural financial
institutions, has also said it is considering such a subsidiary.
But Japan's big commercial banks are unlikely to apply in 1993-94, banking
analysts say.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Coles Myer sees scope for
Australian acquisitions
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLES MYER, Australia's largest retailer, sees scope for increasing its
market share by expanding its operations and through acquisitions, Reuter
reports from Melbourne.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said: 'There are at least a few
percentage points to be added to our market shares in the not too distant
future.' Coles Myer has 17 per cent of the Australian retail market and has
about ADollars 15bn (USDollars 10.7bn) in annual sales.
He said Coles Myer had plenty of scope for closing market gaps with
acquisitions and there were many opportunities to open some of its
businesses in states in which it was not represented.
The decision two weeks ago to open a chain of toy superstores was the first
of the niche market opportunities the group would develop. 'We see plenty of
scope for new business initiatives in other areas and we are looking at a
range of opportunities,' he said.
Coles Myer would concentrate its business in Australia and he did not want
to make promises of offshore expansion. He said growth plans for current
businesses included the opening of new stores, refurbishment of existing
stores, extending trading hours, development of store brands, reducing
unwanted lines and installation of electronic sales systems.
Coles Myer was examining all its operations to see whether the group should
be in them and whether their performance could be improved. 'Indeed, I think
it is obvious to anyone who knows the company well that a new era is well
and truly under way,' Mr Bartels said. There was still work to be done after
its half-year result unveiled recently, which showed a 4 per cent rise in
net profit to ADollars 236.6m in the 26 weeks to January 24.
Mr Bartels said the K mart discount chain was nowhere near its potential,
and he wanted to improve contributions from supermarkets and department
stores.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Digital looks to PCs to rekindle
the flame - US group aims to be one of the top five global suppliers by 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment has seen better days. Apart from superfast
microprocessors, the US group, once second only to International Business
Machines, leads in hardly any area of the computing business.
Dr Juan Rada, economist, academic and, since May 1992, Digital's head of
strategic alliances, explains his company's dilemma: 'Digital has succeeded
as a company when it has invented the future. Its people are not good
followers; it is difficult to get them enthused when they are not leading.'
The company failed to exploit the industry's two most important
developments: the personal computer (PC) and the move to 'open' or
industry-standard systems.
In 1992, it lost money for the successive second year; Dollars 2.8bn, or 20
per cent of revenues, proportionally far worse than International Business
Machines, whose Dollars 4.9bn loss, an industry record, amounted to only 8
per cent of sales.
Can Digital rekindle the spark that took it to number two among the world's
information technology suppliers? Dr Rada believes that Digital's mistakes
have presented it with a clean sheet in three important areas: management,
organisation and technology.
Management: Mr Robert Palmer took over as chairman from Digital's founder,
Mr Kenneth Olsen, last year. He has since named a new senior management
team, appointing several top managers from outside the company.
Organisation: the company has been restructured into nine business units,
each responsible for its financial performance.
Technology: Digital is pinning its hopes on its Alpha microprocesssor chip,
the first to process information 64 bits at a time.
Much will depend on whether Digital can catch industry leaders, such as IBM
and Compaq in personal computers. Customers spend more on PCs than on any
other computer hardware, but net profit margins are small. Success in PCs
means combining high volumes with low prices and excellent distribution.
Digital is starting in PCs with a more or less clean sheet. It failed first
time round because senior management did not take PCs seriously; now Mr
Palmer has set the company the goal of becoming one of the top five global
suppliers by 1995. The aim is to earn about 20 per cent of revenues -
perhaps Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn - from PCs by that date.
To implement the strategy, Mr Palmer appointed Mr Enrico Pesatori as head of
Digital's PC business unit. Mr Pesatori, 52, spent 21 years with Olivetti,
Europe's largest PC manufacturer, before two years as chief executive of
Zenith Data Systems, the PC arm of Groupe Bull of France.
Digital's PC strategy is a rag-bag of solutions. PCs for Europe are made by
Olivetti; Intel builds machines for the US. Notebook PCs and some
workstations are supplied by other manufacturers. In addition, Digital
designs and manufactures its own PCs.
In spite of this haphazard approach, according to Mr Pesatori, Digital has
moved from 22nd to ninth among global PC suppliers in the past 12 months.
'Without a real strategy, but with some sound products, Digital has been
able to achieve impressive results,' he says.
His first job is to create a coherent PC strategy: 'My goal is to have taken
all the strategic decisions before the beginning of our fiscal year, in
July. Implementing the strategy will take a further year.'
That will involve the creation of a single product family, which will mean
changes in the arrangements with Olivetti and with Intel. Mr Pesatori
insists the relationships will be improved rather than severed: 'We have to
move to another level of co-operation to meet what is required today,' he
says. He also intends to appoint professional PC managers to oversee the
all-important distribution strategy.
It could be argued that Digital has left it too late in PCs, but Mr Pesatori
argues that the company's legacy gives it significant advantages.
First, there are its existing customers, which include most of the world's
blue-chip companies. Less than 5 per cent use Digital PCs; by comparison, 48
per cent of IBM customers have at least one IBM PC. If Digital's penetration
rate were raised to only 20 per cent, it would make a considerable
difference.
That large customer base also makes the company attractive to dealers who
would see a sales agreement with Digital as a passport to lucrative new
business.
Second, the Digital brand name. Mr Pesatori accepts that names like IBM and
Compaq can no longer command a premium, but notes that if products are
priced sensibly there is advantage in owning a brand synonymous with
quality.
Third, the company is an acknowledged technology leader; its Alpha chip will
eventually be used in its PCs, giving customers a choice of 64-bit or 32-bit
technology.
Digital faces an uphill battle, but Dr Rada believes the industry's
turbulent state will be an advantage. He quotes a Spanish proverb: 'When the
river is turbulent, the fishermen are the winners.'

takeover

<TEXT>
CS HOLDING, parent company of the financial group built around Credit
Suisse, has confirmed it will go ahead with its SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.05bn)
agreed takeover of Swiss Volksbank.
CS said that by the time of the expiry of its offer yesterday, 93 per cent
of Volksbank shares had been tendered.
The takeover will enable CS to surpass Union Bank of Switzerland to become
Switzerland's largest financial group in terms of assets.
The all-share offer, announced on January 6, has advanced smoothly.
Volksbank, which tumbled into a SFr68m loss last year, had first to win
shareholders' approval to convert itself from a co-operative into a joint
stock company. In the event, the enabling resolution was passed without a
murmur of dissent at an extraordinary general meeting last week.
Under Swiss law, the offer, on the basis of three new CS registered shares
for every 10 Volksbank registered shares, must be extended for 10 banking
days in order to enable the remaining Volksbank shareholders to take
advantage of it.
CS said the new shares would be issued in mid-April.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Wang creditors back plan for
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WANG Laboratories, the US office computer systems company, yesterday filed a
wide-ranging reorganisation plan aimed at enabling the company to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The plan, jointly sponsored by a committee representing unsecured creditors,
would transfer ownership of the company to creditors through an issue of new
stock. It also calls for substantial reductions in operations, with the loss
of 3,300 jobs.
Secured and priority creditors would be paid in full, or as agreed by the
parties. Unsecured creditors would be issued shares in the reorganised
company and warrants would be issued to current shareholders. The plan had
been endorsed by representatives of equity holders, Wang said.
Wang, an early leader in office computer systems, failed to keep pace with
changes in the industry. It filed for bankruptcy protection last August.
'We have truly invented a new Wang,' said Mr Joseph Tucci Wang, president
and chief executive.
Wang would emerge from Chapter 11 free of a substantial portion of the
structural burden and debt that had impeded the company's efforts to
restructure and regain profitability, the company said.
Wang plans to close its manufacturing operations and focus on software and
services. Corporate operations would be streamlined and the company would
'dramatically reduce its infrastructure,' Wang said.
'This plan allows Wang to capitalise upon its leadership in integrated
imaging and office software and network integration and support services,'
said Mr C. Hall Swaim, counsel to the creditor's committee.
The 'new Wang' does not intend to develop or manufacture open systems
computers. Instead, it would resell computers manufactured by other
companies - including International Business Machines, which formed an
alliance with Wang two years ago, and Hewlett-Packard, which reached a joint
marketing and development agreement with Wang two weeks ago.
Wang officials said the company expected to return to profitability in
fiscal year 1994. For the current fiscal year, it anticipated revenues of
around Dollars 1.25bn to Dollars 1.3bn, declining to about Dollars 1bn in
1994.
The job losses involved are higher than expected, however. Wang had more
than 13,000 employees before it filed for protection, at which time it said
it hoped to preserve 8,000 jobs. Yesterday, however, it announced it would
reduce its workforce from 9,300 to 6,000.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ambroveneto raises profits 31%
to L171bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO AMBROSIANO Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private sector bank,
raised parent bank net profits by 31 per cent to L171.4bn (Dollars 106m)
last year, in spite of the recession and the need for write-downs on
securities holdings.
The improvement restores the upward trend in earnings which had been upset
by the need for substantial write-downs on the book value of two
subsidiaries in 1991. However, the dividend remains unchanged at L150 for
ordinary shares and L170 for savings shares.
Gross operating income, net of interest on overdue accounts, rose 17.4 per
cent to L710bn due to an improved interest margin and a 'significant'
contribution from fee income.
Ambroveneto set aside L253bn for loan loss provisions last year, compared
with L180bn in 1991. Write-downs on securities and investments amounted to
L71bn, against L207bn the previous year, when L170bn was set aside for the
newly-acquired Citibank operation.
Deposits rose by 21 per cent to L21,367bn and lending by 21 per cent to
L18,836bn.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Olivetti shares slide as trading
starts again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Olivetti, the Italian computers group, dropped by 17.1 per cent
yesterday in response to Monday's announcement of a L903bn capital increase
and losses of about L650bn (Dollars 404m) for 1992.
Olivetti's ordinary stock slid to L1,825 after the suspension in trading,
imposed on Monday morning, was lifted, against L2,202 at Friday's close. The
sharp fall reflected brokers' reaction to the highly dilutive rights issue
and the poor outlook for the company in the short term.
Mr Corrado Passera, joint managing director, described the fall as 'an
automatic event' in the case of a deeply-discounted rights issue. He said
the true measure of the transaction's success would be the price at which
the shares eventually settle.
Shareholders will be offered six new ordinary shares, priced at a nominal
L1,000 each, for every four shares, of whatever category, currently held.
Alternatively, they may subscribe to at least half their rights in the form
of new shares and the remainder in new six-year convertible bonds, which
will be interchangeable with the new shares and pay interest of between 6
per cent and 8 per cent.
The deal received a hostile reaction from most brokers, who criticised the
deep discount and dilution. 'It's not often you get a rights issue where
shareholders are offered more shares than they already have,' said one.
The transaction has been accompanied by preliminary results from CIR, the
listed holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, which in turn
controls Olivetti, and by Mr De Benedetti's Cofide holding company.
CIR made a preliminary loss of L540bn in 1992, against a net profit of L49bn
the previous year. Around L450bn of the loss stems from extraordinary
factors linked to the difficulties at Olivetti and the need for one-off
provisions at Cerus, the French holding company controlled by CIR.
The special provisions have been chiefly triggered by credit problems at
Banque Dumenil Leble in France, particularly as regards lending to the
depressed property sector. At parent company level, CIR's loss rose to
L680bn from L469bn in 1991.
CIR's net debt surged to about L440bn from L41bn due to the effects of its
losses, the increased lira value of foreign currency borrowing, and changes
in the items consolidated in the group's accounts.
The group said almost all its subsidiaries, which include Valeo, the French
car components concern, the Italian Sasib engineering group and the
Espresso/Repubblica publisher, were expected to report improved results for
1992.
Separately, Cofide said it expected to make a net loss of about L290bn in
1992, against net earnings of L41bn the previous year. The company is to
make a L112.7bn rights issue of new ordinary shares, priced at L1,000 each.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: MoDo stops payout after tumbling
into loss of SKr1.7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MODO, the Swedish forestry group, has cancelled its dividend after swinging
to a SKr1.7bn (Dollars 216m) loss in 1992 from a SKr221m profit a year
earlier.
The result, which was worse than expected, was hit by SKr700m in foreign
exchange losses and start-up costs for a new French mill, but highly
competitive market conditions were the main reason for the decline.
Excess of supply for most forest industry products continued during 1992,
squeezing prices and capacity utilisation, despite higher demand, said Mr
Bernt Lof, the group chief executive.
Losses doubled in the final four months of the year from SKr811m at the
eight-month stage, with the weakening of the krona from November coming too
late to benefit the group. In 1991, the group paid a SKr7 dividend, which
was down from SKr13 in 1990.
Sales fell to SKr15.7bn from SKr17.4bn, and the group saw an operating loss
of SKr135m after a SKr1.06bn profit in 1991. This was aggravated by higher
financial costs of SKr1.3bn, against SKr841m.
The main lossmaker was MoDo Paper, where operating losses deepened to
SKr696m from SKr194m, but profits sank sharply at Holmen Paper to SKr40m
from SKr496m.
Mr Lof said the group's rationalisation programme, which resulted in 950 job
losses, had saved the company more than SKr500m during the year, and he
predicted a further benefit this year.
The group said it expected its capacity utilisation, which fell to 85 per
cent in 1992, to rise in 1993, helped by a better supply and demand balance
and a successive rise in prices. It also said it would benefit from lower
wood prices, a reduced energy tax, and the devaluation of the krona.

FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: IRI plans more share deals to
cut huge debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR executives at IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, facing
consolidated debts of over L70,000bn (Dollars 43.61bn), are determined to
push through further complex share swaps among subsidiaries, despite severe
criticism from the stock market and investors.
The attacks follow weekend leaks that IRI plans to cede to its Stet
telecommunications arm for three years the dividend on its 57 per cent stake
in the ordinary shares of Banca Commerciale Italiana, the big bank which is
a future privatisation candidate.
The transaction will allow Stet, which is highly profitable, to offset tax
credits on the dividends against its tax bill and provide a net return of 23
per cent. Meanwhile, IRI, which is facing crippling losses following
difficulties at many of its industrial operations, will receive a L340bn
payment in return.
Although shifting tax credits within a group to lower its overall tax burden
is commonplace in Italy, IRI's plan has produced a barrage of criticism. The
attacks on the deal range from claims that it will block BCI's privatisation
to suggestions that corporate tax avoidance is immoral.
'I don't know what they're complaining about', said one banker closely
associated with the transaction. 'Half of corporate Italy does this; it's
the 22nd deal of the kind I've done'.
Financial engineering of dividend payments also reflects the six-year period
Italian companies have to wait before they receive tax credits from the
government. When eventually paid, the money attracts interest at far below
market rates.
IRI has about L3,700bn in tax credits outstanding, implying that it could
undertake a large number of similar transactions. However, bankers point out
that not all the credits are suitable, and the overall amount that could be
in the short term is about L1,000bn, of which L340bn will come from the Stet
deal.
IRI has a number of cash-rich subsidiaries which could be used for similar
exercises. One obvious candidate is Sirti, the network engineering arm of
Stet, which has a cash pool of about L1,000bn.

INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, has acquired control of
Switzerland's exclusive distributor of Daihatsu, Maserati and Lotus
vehicles, in a Pounds 19.2m deal.
It has bought a 90 per cent stake in Reverberi for Pounds 9.4m and will also
assume responsibility for the private company's borrowings of Pounds 9.8m.
Reverberi, which will be managed by TKM, Inchcape's motors subsidiary, is
based near Sion and has represented Daihatsu in Switzerland since 1976. Last
year it sold 1,000 Daihatsus, and about 40 Maserati and Lotus vehicles.
Mr Reg Heath, chief executive of TKM and an Inchcape director, said this was
the eighth new import and distribution business Inchcape had acquired since
it bought TKM for Pounds 382m a year ago.
He said: 'Inchcape is already the exclusive importer and distributor of
Daihatsu vehicles in the UK, Belgium and the Irish Republic, and this
acquisition marks a significant strengthening of our relationship with this
manufacturer.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Lionheart falls into Pounds 870,000 loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIONHEART, the Cheshire-based paint brushes and home improvements group
which returned to the dividend list only last year, yesterday reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 870,000 for 1992, and passed its final distribution.
The loss compared with a profit of Pounds 2.39m.
Mr Paul Lever, executive chairman, blamed recession for depressing sales
volumes by 19 per cent and forcing price cuts that reduced margins by 3
percentage points. After shedding a fifth of the workforce to save Pounds
2m, he said Lionheart was now back in profit.
All 1991 figures have been restated under accounting standard FRS 3.
Turnover was up nearly 23 per cent at Pounds 43.6m (Pounds 35.5m) but cost
of sales rose 25 per cent to Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 21.9m) and net operating
expenses by 54 per cent to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 10.4m).
This reduced operating profit to only Pounds 207,000 against a previous
Pounds 3.21m. Exceptional debits, made up of abortive acquisition costs and
a loss on disposal of discontinued operations, were Pounds 372,000. Interest
charges rose from Pounds 543,000 to Pounds 705,000.
After two years of reconstruction under Mr Lever, Lionheart returned to the
dividend list with a 0.3p final a year ago. It then paid an interim dividend
of 0.2p. Mr Lever said: 'After consultations in the City we decided it was
better to be prudent and preserve resources. We could have paid a 0.1p final
and still have headroom, but with the uncertainty about the economy we felt
it better to be careful.'
The company, in which Newell, the US paint brush manufacturer, increased its
stake from 13.4 per cent to 20 per cent during the year, has reduced gearing
from 37 per cent to 12.7 per cent by the sale and leaseback of its
Wellingborough factory.
Mr Lever said profitability returned in the fourth quarter, although an
expected Christmas pick-up in sales of shower curtains and bathroom
accessories had not materialised.

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hall hit by rationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALL Engineering (Holdings), the steel stockholding, construction products
and automotive engineering group, yesterday announced a Pounds 21m
'breakthrough' order in Gerany and virtually unchanged profits for 1992,
before exceptionals, of Pounds 5.6m.
However, a Pounds 1.84m exceptional item for rationalisation at Hall &amp;
Pickles and British Reinforced Concrete Engineering left the pre-tax line at
Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 5.07m). Group turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds
135.7m.
Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said conditions remained depressed, causing
worsening results from steel reinforcement and metal stockholding where
profits fell by Pounds 800,000 and Pounds 1m respectively.
Profits from associated companies improved from Pounds 5m to Pounds 6.8m. In
particular, Mr Hall said the 50 per cent-owned Singapore reinforcing steel,
roofing and cladding businesses were 'going like a rocket.'
Engineering profits dropped by Pounds 1.3m, with fewer automation contracts
at Stadco being completed. But Mr Hall said he was delighted to announce
that Stadco's automation division had won a Pounds 21m contract from Audi in
Germany.
The order is a record for Stadco. It furthers its ambitions to move to 'a
slightly higher rung' in the automotive manufacturing equipment sector
according to Mr Brian Hinkins, group managing director. The continuing
predominance of profit from overseas led to a further build-up of ACT in the
UK - and the ACT write-off of Pounds 1.8m is higher than previously
expected. The effective tax rate last year was 74 per cent, but Hall
estimates the rate this year will be 37.5 per cent.
A total tax charge of Pounds 2.76m, and a Pounds 1.37m extraordinary charge
due mainly to the decision to close steelmaking operations in South Africa,
produced a net loss for the year of Pounds 408,000 (Pounds 3.56m).
Earnings per share dipped from 11.34p to 3.05p, while the dividend is
maintained at 8.64p with a same-again final of 5.34p.
Mr Hall said the current year has had a much better start than last year.
Increases in steel prices, rationalisation at Hall and the current round of
capacity cuts in the reinforcement industry left him 'more optimistic than I
have been for some time for the future performance of the group.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Searching for an early route out of limbo -
Attempts to realise the value of Vestel for PPI's creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tahsin Karan, the long suffering chairman and chief executive of Vestel
Elektronik, Polly Peck International's Istanbul-based consumer electronics
subsidiary, is to step down at tomorrow's annual meeting.
His departure is a further blow to creditors and administrators of the
failed British fruit and electronics group built up by Mr Asil Nadir. The
eventual sale of Vestel is one of the few hopes the 23,000 creditors have of
recouping even a small fraction of their money.
Already in the throes of a corporate restructuring, and facing an
anti-dumping investigation by the European Community, Vestel is losing the
marketing brains and man who, more than any other, was responsible for
Vestel's emergence as an important force in Turkish electronics.
The search for a replacement has been painstakingly slow. 'The company has
been in a sort of limbo,' complains Mr Karan, describing the 27 months since
the administrators were appointed. 'Without solid ownership, it has been
impossible to take aggressive positions.'
For all the tensions, the administrator can have few grumbles about Vestel's
management, which has provided a welcome degree of co-operation, something
which cannot be said of PPI's other Turkish subsidiaries.
Vestel is considered PPI's strongest Turkish asset. Started in 1985 the
company quickly established itself as Turkey's leading exporter of colour
televisions, while carving out a respectable slice of the local market.
Vestel successfully floated a minority stake on the Istanbul exchange in
June 1990. Its present market capitalisation is Dollars 53m (Pounds 37.3m).
Tomorrow it is expected to report 1992 pre-tax profits of TL161bn (Pounds
13.4m) on sales of about TL2,150bn against TL74bn on TL1,400bn a year
earlier and TL167bn on TL851bn in 1990.
Vestel's strategy has been to sell its own branded televisions, audio
products and other brown and white goods under marketing deals in Spain and
Portugal and most recently a joint manufacturing venture in Romania. The
bulk of the export production, though, is made to the design and
specification of a foreign purchaser, under original equipment manufacturing
agreements.
In 1992, Vestel generated Dollars 70m in export sales, with brown goods
accounting for 80 per cent. But export prospects to EC markets are clouded
by the anti-dumping inquiry.
Under Turkey's Association Agreement with the EC, Turkish electronics can
enter the community duty free. The investigation involves imports of colour
televisions which community officials contend rely on cheap components from
the Far East and therefore should incur extra duties.
Turkey is now the largest supplier of medium size televisions to the EC.
Vestel relies on television shipments for 80 per cent of its export
revenues. If the charges stick, Mr Karan anticipates Vestel's exports to the
community could fall by as much as a third.
The export uncertainty and prospect of more import competition in Turkey
have not made it any easier for the administrators to find a buyer for
Vestel.
The first option of floating the company on the Istanbul exchange was
quickly ruled out. 'It was probably always going to be difficult to float
any company associated with PPI,' said an Istanbul banker.
A quest was then launched for a minority partner to help Vestel expand its
product range in the European market. If the company was to attract a
foreign buyer, the administrators argued, it was also necessary to split the
business. Unlike Europe and the US, Turkey's electronics groups are still
engaged in both white and brown goods.
In June, the company sold 25 per cent of its white goods activity to Merloni
Elettrodomestici, the Italian group. The Dollars 8.5m proceeds bolstered the
balance sheet rather than being remitted to PPI in London.
The link up had an obvious logic, given that in its home market Vestel was
already distributing the Philco range, 50 per cent owned by Merloni. In turn
Merloni has the licence for the Philco brand name in Europe, providing what
Mr Karan sees as a 'guarantee for our exports'.
Merloni has also provided a strategic platform to export household and white
goods to north Africa, and the central Asian states.
Capacity is to double at the refrigerator line, where half of production is
for export. Merloni is expected to take up its option to become the 51 per
cent majority shareholder.
The future for the brown goods arm, Vestel's main operation, remains
unresolved. The administrators are in negotiations with a variety of
interested parties, including Singer, the US electronics concern.
Paradoxically, the decision to demerge the white goods business means any
buyer of the brown goods operation may find it more difficult to maintain
share in the domestic market, where traditionally Turkish retailers like to
handle the whole range of consumer electronic goods.

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Johnson caution with slight fall to Pounds
15.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON Group Cleaners, the UK's largest dry cleaning company, yesterday
offered cold comfort to green shoot economists, saying it had seen no signs
of recovery either here or in the US.
'We are being very cautious until we see some tangible sign of uplift,' said
Mr Terry Greer, chairman. And just when that will happen, he said, 'well,
your guess is as good as mine.'
Mr Greer said Johnson had been adversely affected by the exceptionally cold
weather in the US, as well as by the continued severity of recession. 'We
are reading about signs of recovery there, but we haven't seen any,' he
said.
The statements came as the group reported a slight decline in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 16m to Pounds 15.8m for the 12 months to December 26, on
sales 2 per cent lower at Pounds 150.8m.
The decline at the pre-tax level was due to a Pounds 148,000 deficit on
property, against a profit of Pounds 130,000 last time, following a Pounds
638,000 write-down on the value of a factory.
Excluding property, Johnson reported a slight increase from Pounds 15.9m to
Pounds 16m.
The most significant factor affecting profits was a Pounds 1.4m decline in
interest payments to Pounds 1.6m. Gearing fell from 39 per cent to 23 per
cent.
The strongest performance came from the group's growing workwear rental
business, supplying uniforms and sundries to small and medium-sized
businesses.
Operating profits in this division were Pounds 270,000 lower at Pounds 8.7m,
on sales 7 per cent down to Pounds 41m. The decline in turnover reflected
the sale of a business in the US.
In the UK, where Johnson claims some 10 per cent of the workwear market,
operating profits and sales were slightly ahead, Mr Greer said.
The dry cleaning market on both side of the Atlantic continued to be
depressed. Margins and sales fell, with operating profit Pounds 1m lower at
Pounds 8.8m on turnover down from Pounds 110.3m to Pounds 109.8m.
Losses in Johnson's US franchise operation had increased from last year's
Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 176,000), in spite of efforts to control costs. Mr
Greer said there was little more that could be done, without economic
recovery.
The final dividend is maintained for the third consecutive year at 18.7p,
for an unchanged total of 25.7p.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 48.7p to 49.12p.
COMMENT
Johnson's larger competitors might take heed of the company's softly softly
approach to workwear rental. By focusing on smaller to medium-sized
customers, and avoiding the volatile catering and leisure sectors, Johnson
has managed to keep its bucket of business topped up and at margins
(reportedly as high as 20 per cent) which are only dreamed of by others. Now
Johnson intends to tackle larger customers on a national basis - although in
its usual cautious manner, says Mr Greer - while its rivals are moving down
the scale. Although Mr Greer traditionally downplays the outlook, analysts
are more enthusiastic and count on some recovery to begin this year.
Forecasts are for about Pounds 17.5m pre-tax, excluding property gains, for
a prospective p/e of about 16 times. Although this seems to be up with
events in the short-term, Johnson's mid-cycle prospects and solid record
might lead some to tuck this away for the upturn.

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BBA gets Pounds 58m for stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the engineering group, yesterday sold its 57 per cent stake in Pacific
BBA, the Australian industrial and automotive manufacturer, for ADollars
122.5m (Pounds 58m). The shares were placed with institutions.
The sale reduces BBA's net debt, which stood at Pounds 227.5m in December,
bringing down gearing from 61 per cent to 44 per cent on a year-end basis.
Mr Peter Clappison, finance director, said this was about the group's
'comfort level' for gearing.
BBA's share price gained 7p to close at 171p.
The group said it was concentrating on developing its core operations in
Europe and North America. It has a policy of disposing of non-core
activities 'depending on their performance and the interest among potential
buyers'.
The diversified group, which has automotive, industrial and aviation
divisions, defines a core business as having a strong international market
share, technological leadership and where barriers are high to the entry of
competitors.
In terms of acquisition priorities, Mr Clappison said the most likely area
would be the industrial division. This was the biggest contributor to the
group's Pounds 47.4m pre-tax profit, on sales of Pounds 1.32bn, announced
last week.
Pacific BBA had been operating as a separate entity within the group,
particularly since it gained a listing on the Australian stock exchange in
November 1989.
Mr Peter Cottrell, Pacific BBA chairman, said it was 'pleasing to be able to
reverse the trend of overseas acquisitions of Australian assets'. The
company's priorities lay with expanding in the Asia Pacific region.
Earlier this month Pacific BBA announced a rise in after-tax profit to
ADollars 9.78m (ADollars 7.51m) for 1992 on sales of ADollars 291m. Its
contribution to BBA's profits after tax and the minority deduction was
Pounds 2.7m.
Pacific BBA shares closed 14 cents higher at ADollars 2.90 on the Australian
stock exchange.

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Avon sets up Saudi venture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AVON RUBBER, the UK tyre and automotive components concern, has agreed to a
joint venture with a group of Middle Eastern investors to build a Dollars
200m (Pounds 141m) tyre factory in Saudi Arabia.
Avon will invest Pounds 2m and will provide technology for the plant in
return for a 5 per cent stake in the factory. The rest of the funding is to
be provided by a group of Saudi investors.
The factory is expected to come on stream in 1995, with initial production
targeted at 650,000 tyres a year. It is expected that after five years the
plant will produce some 1m tyres - about 20 per cent of overall Saudi
demand.
In December, Avon announced a 36 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to
Pounds 9.15m. The group is heavily dependent on the US market where more
than 25 per cent of its business is based.

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Attwoods advance to Pounds 15.5m checked by
US operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTWOODS, the waste management company, yesterday reported an 11.6 per cent
increase in profits to Pounds 15.5m, but was held back by its US metal
recycling business.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to end-January rose from Pounds 13.9m to
Pounds 15.5m, using the new FRS 3 and Fred 3 accounting principles, on sales
up 16 per cent at Pounds 195.3m.
Earnings per share fell from 4.36p to 3.7p, after last year's dilutive
debt-reducing rights issue. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.75p.
Mr Ken Foreman, chairman, said he was 'overall cautiously optimistic for the
year'.
The main hit at the operating level came in the US from Mindis, the metal
recycling business. The company, which is largely dependent on world metal
prices, swung from an operating profit of Pounds 900,000 to a loss of Pounds
2.8m on sales of Dollars 54m (Pounds 38m) in the first half.
Profits would have been flat without the benefit of exchange translations
from the dollar and D-Mark.
Exchange translation also affected net borrowings, with net debt up Pounds
50.6m from the year-end at Pounds 125.9m. This gave gearing of 52.2 per
cent, up from 36.4 per cent. Interest cover fell to 10 times.
At constant exchange rates, debt would have risen by Pounds 25m, in line
with Attwoods' expectations.
Operationally, the Florida waste operation performed well and reaped a net
gain from the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.
In continental Europe, an anticipated reduction in margins from the planned
expansion of the waste management division, was worse than expected due to
the downturn in the German economy.
Germany accounted for 16 per cent of group sales and was less likely to
suffer from the economic downturn as much of its business was related to
construction and environmental services in the eastern part of the country,
the company said.

immediately. No reason for their departure was given, and neither could be
reached for comment.
However, it is understood they disagreed with the way Hi-Tec was being

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Margins improve as Scholes expands 45%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOLES, the electrical installation materials group, lifted pre-tax profits
by 45 per cent on almost flat turnover of Pounds 29.7m in the half year
ended December 1992.
The group said it had achieved the improvement to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds
916,000) through a reduction in operating costs and working capital.
Operating profits improved to Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 1.25m) and margins rose
to 5.49 per cent (4.23 per cent).
The results were calculated in accordance with accounting standard FRS 3
with 1991 results restated.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.6p. Earnings per share rose 36 per
cent to 2.37p (1.74p).
Net borrowings fell to Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 5.07m) and gearing dropped to 9
per cent (22 per cent).
The group said borrowings had fallen mainly because it had reduced the
number of weeks it carries stocks, but also because of scrutiny of capital
spending.
Mr Bill Riches, chairman, said: 'We have not put a squeeze on capital
expenditure, but we are scrutinising applications from the companies very
carefully.'

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: White knight moves in for Brabant with
Pounds 9.6m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRABANT Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas explorer which has been
fighting a paper bid from fellow resource company Aberdeen Petroleum,
yesterday threw itself into the arms of a North American white knight in a
last ditch effort to avoid a hostile takeover.
The board has recommended a 58p per share cash offer from Houston-based
Energy Development Corporation, a subsidiary of a New Jersey public utility,
valuing Brabant at Pounds 9.6m.
The price compares with Brabant's flotation price of 155p in October 1990.
If the EDC offer succeeds, Brabant will withdraw from the USM.
Aberdeen, which itself is battling a hostile bid from Pittencrieff, the
natural resources and telecommunications group, indicated yesterday that it
intended to take up the EDC offer. Mr David Hooker, Aberdeen's managing
director, said the company would make a Pounds 500,000 profit after
'transaction-related expenses'.
The EDC deal was agreed late Monday night as it became apparent that
shareholders representing more than 40 per cent of Brabant were not
supportive.
Mr Nicholas Gay, finance director, said that as recently as Wednesday,
Brabant had been confident of victory in its battle against Aberdeen.
However on Thursday, a New York arbitrage firm had managed to buy some 12.5
per cent of Brabant's shares from small shareholders.
Towards the end of the week it was also discovered that one of Brabant's
largest institutional investors was anxious to dispose of its stake.
Mr Gay said that after these events - and taking into account the 21 per
cent either held by or pledged to Aberdeen it became apparent that Brabant
would be very vulnerable even if Aberdeen's bid failed.
EDC, which is being advised by Charterhouse, said it had received
irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer representing 18.94 per cent of
Brabant.

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Simon shows decline to Pounds 5.3m -
Recession and loss of contract lead to profit fall and dividend cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMON Engineering, overshadowed by dividend worries for more than a year,
yesterday passed its final after announcing a steep fall in profits.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 5.32m in the year to
December 31, mainly due to recession and losses on an important paper
engineering contract. The figures, which were below market expectations,
were described as 'extremely poor' by Mr Roy Roberts, chairman. Mr Roberts
announced he would retire at the end of this year.
The shares, which collapsed last year from 301p to a low of 70p, were down
21p early yesterday, but rallied to close 1p up on the day at 114p.
Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 487.6m (Pounds 514.5m), mainly because of
reduced sales in process engineering. The paper contract, at Jacksonville,
Florida, led to a Pounds 5m loss for the year and a Pounds 3.3m write back
of profits taken in 1991.
The powered access equipment division was affected by falling sales and
margins and trading profits fell from Pounds 5m to Pounds 3.1m. Mr Brian
Kemp, chief executive, said there were signs of improvement in the US, but
the UK remained weak.
Simon sold most of its environmental division earlier this year, leading to
a Pounds 5.39m extraordinary charge. The company did not apply FRS 3 because
it said the sale of the division was non-recurring.
A fall in advance receipts from process engineering, and an increase in US
borrowings because of exchange translations, meant net debt increased from
Pounds 37m to Pounds 101.2m. Gearing more than doubled to 87 per cent.
However, the sale of the environmental division has reduced gearing since
the year-end to about 65 per cent.
Earnings fell to 2.6p (12.5p) per share. Following the extraordinary charge,
and an interim dividend of 5p - last year's total distribution was 15.7p
including a final of 10.7p - there was a transfer from reserves of Pounds
7.83m (Pounds 11.1m).
COMMENT
Simon's shareholders must be wondering if anything else can go wrong. After
being assured by the chairman 12 months ago that this year's dividend would
be covered, yesterday's cut suggests over-optimism or misjudgement of the
company's markets. The severity of recession is only a partial excuse,
accounting for the downturns in the construction and offshore sectors, while
the loss on the Jacksonville contract is harder to justify and could
scarcely have come at a worse time. Simon remains cautious about this year
and is not forecasting any growth in its markets. Although access sales in
the US should pick up, Simon needs its process engineering advance receipts
to improve and reduce borrowings. Forecast profits this year of Pounds 12m
put the shares on more than 18 times. Probably the only prop under the
shares at this level is the group's perceived vulnerability to takeover.

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rate cuts undermine Wimpey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIMPEY, one of Britain's biggest construction groups revealed yesterday how
sharp falls in UK and US interest rates had undermined carefully laid plans
to restrict the cost of borrowings in the 1990s.
The group, like many large businesses, had entered into a series of hedging
deals to limit rises in borrowing charges if international interest rates
increased.
In fact UK and US interest rates have fallen and yesterday Wimpey announced
provisions of Pounds 25.5m to cover the cost of unwinding those banking
agreements.
Mr Roger Wood, finance director, said: 'The company in the late 1980s was
concerned it would be squeezed between falling house prices and sales in the
UK and US and rising international interest rates and entered into a series
of hedging deals. '
In the three years from 1988 to 1990, these saved Wimpey about Pounds 11m.
By last year interest rates had moved against the group costing it an
additional Pounds 7m in interest charges in 1992.
The mechanisms used by Wimpey to protect itself from rising interest rates
involved a a complex package of interest rate caps, swaps and collars.
These firstly put a ceiling on interest charges by requiring banks to pay
any excess above an agreed fixed interest rate. In the case of the company's
sterling debt the cap was fixed at about an average of 12 per cent. For
dollar debt the cap was triggered at about 10.5 per cent.
Wimpey also entered into swaps and collars to fix rates at an average 11.4
per cent in sterling and 8.7 per cent in dollars. This meant that Wimpey
would have to fund the difference if interest rates dropped below those
levels.
Commercial interest rates currently are about 6 per cent in the UK and 3.25
per cent in the US, said Wimpey which under the hedging arrangements has
been unable to benefit from lower interest charges.
Mr Wood who joined Wimpey in 1991 said that the group is now negotiating a
new series of agreements to offset the impact of previous deals.
These involve capping sterling and dollar borrowings at much lower rates as
well as protecting the company in case interest rates fall even further. The
new arrangements will affect up to 40 per cent of the group's borrowings.
The provisions are to cover the difference between the cost of the new
safety net and the original hedging arrangements.
The group estimates that it will save Pounds 8m in interest charges in the
current year and Pounds 5m in 1994 as a result of its provisions on the
former hedging arrangements.

FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Graseby to raise Dollars 25m via US
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRASEBY, the environmental monitoring and medical equipment company,
yesterday said it will float its environmental business in the US on Nasdaq,
raising about Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) but retaining control.
The move is designed to strengthen the balance sheet by reducing debt, which
will allow the group to finance further growth of its environmental and
product monitoring and its medical businesses.
The company also announced yesterday a sharp drop in profits before tax from
Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 1m for 1992, but the dividend is held at 10.9p, with a
final of 7.6p.
The company said that further development had been hampered not only by high
debt, but also by the level of the above average dividend pay-out, a
hangover from the days when Cambridge Electronics - Graseby before the name
change - was rated as a yield stock.
The newly floated company, Graseby Andersen, will not pay a dividend,
putting some pressure on the parent to meet its dividend bill.
Earnings per share fell from 8.7p to 1.3p, after an above - the - line
Pounds 1.5m profit on the sale of properties and a loss of Pounds 5.8m on
sale and disclosure of discontinued operations. This was in line with the
new FRS 3 standard.
Sales fell from Pounds 109.1m to Pounds 102.6m, and operating profit on
continuing operations was Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 12.4m). Operationally the
medical, instruments and environmental businesses performed well, but
defence profits fell from Pounds 6m to Pounds 300,000.
Graseby Andersen had sales of Dollars 39m and operating profits of Dollars
4.7m in 1992. It will be floated with Graseby Specac, the optical company.
Mr John Jackson, Graseby chairman, said the flotation would solve the
balance sheet problems and would also increase motivation for the US
management.
Graseby Andersen should benefit from changes to the US environmental
programme once the Clinton administration settles down.
Because of a lack of distributable reserves in the US, the former Tace
businesses - broadly the Graseby Andersen business being floated - was not
paying dividends to the group.

FT  17 MAR 93 / George Wimpey reports Pounds 112m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE WIMPEY, Britain's second largest housebuilder, yesterday announced a
Pounds 112.4m pre-tax loss, the worst result in its 100-year history.
The loss, taken after an exceptional provision of Pounds 113.8m, underlines
the depth of the recession in the UK housing and construction markets. It
follows a Pounds 16.1m pre-tax loss in 1991.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, however claimed that the worst may now be
over - particularly in the UK housing market where Wimpey's sales had risen
33 per cent since the New Year against the first 10 weeks of last year.
'There are clear signs that the market is strengthening. I believe this
trend will continue provided measures in the Budget do not undermine fragile
returning confidence,' said Mr Dwyer.
The company's shares rose almost 8 per cent to 136p following Wimpey's
upbeat comments on UK house sales and on reports that group borrowings had
reduced further than expected.
Net debt, benefiting from disposals and a strong cashflow from construction,
fell last year from Pounds 206m to Pounds 136m reducing the company's
gearing from 35 per cent to 30 per cent, its lowest for a decade. The group
raised more than Pounds 300m from selling commercial properties and
peripheral businesses since 1989.
Provisions, mostly against the group's UK and US housing and commercial
property operations, included Pounds 25.5m for unwinding interest-rate
hedging deals.
Arrangements agreed in the late 1980s to protect Wimpey against rising
interest rates had worked against the group as borrowing costs had fallen,
said Mr Dwyer. These added about Pounds 7m to interest charges which last
year fell Pounds 29.1m to Pounds 19.4m.
Mr Dwyer said: 'We believe that our 1992 results represent a low point in
our profitability. I expect trading overall to remain difficult during 1993.
However there are now positive signs emerging that the business cycle is
beginning to turn both in the UK and US.'
The company, in spite of losses per share after exceptional and
extraordinary provisions of 41.31p (compared with 11.13p loss per share in
1991), is paying a final dividend of 3.25p (down from 6.5p) making a total
for 1992 of 5.25p (against 10.5p)

FT  17 MAR 93 / Split over strategy for merchant bank: The aftermath of a
disagreement at Baring Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago, Mr Christopher Heath was a stockbroker who had it all. He
was reputedly the UK's highest paid man, earning several millions pounds a
year - and the Asian securities firm he had founded, Baring Securities, had
received establishment approval with a Queen's Award for Export Achievement
(in 1991 it won a second Queen's Award).
On Monday, he appeared as mortal as the hundreds of other City of London
brokers who have lost their jobs in the past few years. He resigned as
chairman of Baring Securities and all his other directorships in the firm's
parent company, Barings Plc, having had a disagreement over strategy with
the parent company's deputy chairman, Mr Andrew Tuckey.
If the spoils for Mr Heath have been rich, they have not been insubstantial
for the merchant banking group Barings - though the precise level of its
earnings from Baring Securities have been obscured in its traditionally
opaque accounts.
In the early 1980s, Barings had been a staid and somewhat sleepy merchant
bank - a pale shadow of the family business described by the Duc de
Richelieu in 1818 as the sixth great power in Europe (though Barings is
probably today better known for being at the heart of the City of London's
greatest financial crisis of the last century, the 1890 Baring crisis).
In 1984, Barings made one of its most astute investments when it bought the
Asian stockbroking business set up by Mr Heath. The core of this securities
business was the purchase and sale of Japanese equities to non-Japanese
investment institutions.
Foreign interest in Japanese shares reached a peak in the mid-1980s - and
Baring Securities was one of the main beneficiaries. It became the most
profitable UK-owned broker of Japanese shares - and one of the most
profitable Asian securities firms in the world (though its profits were a
fraction of domestic Japanese firms).
The success of Baring Securities seemed to give a new impetus to Barings'
traditional activities - though much of the credit for this revival was
because of a reorganisation by Mr Tuckey.
Barings' fund management business has grown rapidly and today has more than
Pounds 22bn under management. But perhaps more important has been the
revival in the traditional heart of Barings, its corporate finance
department which provides advice to UK and international companies. Its
return to the first division of UK corporate finance was confirmed last year
when it was chosen by Lloyds Bank as its adviser in the battle with Hongkong
Bank for control of Midland Bank.
'The success of Baring Securities was helpful to the group as a whole,' Mr
Tuckey said yesterday. 'But the success of the bank (in corporate finance)
and of asset management would have happened in any event.'
The culmination of his expansionist strategy came at the end of 1991 when
Barings bought a 40 per cent stake in one of Wall Street's investment banks,
Dillon Read. In the table, the return to profit of Barings' US business is
predominantly attributable to Dillon Read.
But last year Mr Heath's magic goose stopped laying golden eggs. As Japanese
share prices have fallen dramatically over the past three years, foreign
investors' interest in Japan has wained.
Almost 40 per cent of Baring Securities' revenues are still linked to
Japanese securities trading, even though it has over the past five years
built up highly profitable businesses in other Asian and South American
markets.
As a result, Baring Securities incurred a loss of nearly Pounds 20m last
year, in part due to the costs of cutting more than 100 staff in September
and making provisions for the costs of surplus office space. Because Baring
Securities is headquartered in London, its loss contributed to the fall in
its parent's UK profits from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 2m in 1992 as shown in
the table.
The disagreement between Mr Heath and Mr Tuckey, which reached a climax at
the weekend, was over measures to return Baring Securities to profit. Mr
Heath wanted Barings to allocate more of its capital to Baring Securities,
so that the securities firm could carry out more proprietary trading, which
is the business of trading securities and derivative instruments for its own
account - several US securities houses, such as Salomon Brothers, have
adopted such a strategy in Japan. However, Mr Tuckey believed this would
make the group too exposed to the performance of the securities business.
His aim is to create a group of equally important divisions, so that a poor
performance by one business can be offset by profits from another.
He believes the way to boost Baring Securities' profits is to encourage it
to work more closely with the corporate finance department, so that it can
win an increasing number of mandates to issue new securities for companies
in Asia and South America.
The other part of his strategy, which will be carried out by Baring
Securities' new chairman, Mr Miles Rivett-Carnac, is for Baring Securities
to concentrate on emerging markets, such as those in South America,
Singapore, Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and Malaysia, where dealing commissions
are far wider than in developed markets.
But Mr Tuckey insisted there were no plans to prune the Japanese business
any further. He also denied market speculation that there would be cuts in
the 100 staff employed in trading derivatives. Indeed he said that the
securities business had proved to be remarkably resilient, following the
reorganisation last autumn. 'We have maintained our market share in all
major markets,' he said. Baring Securities is back in profit.
As for Mr Heath, he is staying at Barings as a consultant. However, his
friends say he is still 'very hungry', for all his millions. Baring
Securities could one day face competition from a new Heath-led broker.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Owners Abroad fights off hostile bid: Attempted takeover by
Airtours thwarted by Thomas Cook's 'spoiling action'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS Abroad, the UK's second largest holiday tour operator, yesterday
narrowly fought off the hostile Pounds 290m bid from rival Airtours after
one of the closest takeover battles the City has seen in recent years.
The outcome was only decided yesterday after Gartmore, a 7.6 per cent
shareholder in Owners Abroad and a strong early supporter of the Airtours
bid, switched its allegiance to the defender at the last moment.
Thomas Cook, the German-controlled travel agency which will now forge a
commercial tie-up with Owners Abroad, also proved decisive. Yesterday,
Thomas Cook increased its stake to 8.37 per cent.
At 1pm when the offer closed, Airtours had received acceptances from
shareholders representing 35.18 per cent of Owners' shares. Airtours
continued to buy shares yesterday morning, taking its stake in Owners Abroad
to 8.2 per cent. Thomas Cook is expected to end up with a 17.8 per cent
stake in Owners Abroad. Last week Thomas Cook said it would tender for up to
12.5 per cent of Owners' shares at 150p. Owners' shares fell yesterday from
138p to 126p. Owners Abroad's share register will also include Mercury Asset
Management, the 15 per cent shareholder that supported Airtours' bid.
Owners' defence of its independence was welcomed by many in the holiday
industry who were angry when the Secretary of State for industry did not
refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'The market has done
the job that the Secretary of State failed to do,' said Mr Noel Josephides,
chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators. The small
operators had warned they could be forced out of business by a price war
that Thomson, the market leader in the UK, would have launched had Airtours
won.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said he was disappointed Thomas
Cook's 'spoiling action' had carried the day. Some 43 per cent of Owners'
shareholders had sold to Airtours or accepted the offers, he said.
'As the largest independent customer of Air 2000 (Owners charter airline)
and now one of the largest shareholders in Owners Abroad, we shall be
watching developments at the company closely,' Mr Crossland said.

FT  17 MAR 93 / VW cuts dividend to DM2 and shakes up management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Germany's stricken motor industry group, yesterday slashed its
dividend and shook out its management board in the wake of an 86 per cent
profits collapse last year.
The key new appointment was that of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
snatched from arch-rival General Motors in an unseemly tug-of-war over the
weekend.
Net group earnings tumbled to DM147m (Pounds 62m) from DM1.1bn in 1991, and
the payout was cut to DM2 on both ordinary and preference shares, compared
with DM11 and DM12 respectively, the company said yesterday.
Turnover on the delivery of a record 3.52m vehicles last year rose to
DM85.4bn from DM76bn, adding weight to the popular view that the more cars
VW sells, the less profit it makes.
Mr Lopez was named as director in charge of production and purchasing with
immediate effect. His was the only outside face to appear in the new
management team picked by Mr Ferdinand Piech, who has been group chairman
since January 1.
Mr Lopez replaces Mr Gunter Hartwich, who is to leave the company and will
function as an adviser, the company said.
As expected, Mr Dieter Ullsperger, finance director, has lost his job. His
place will be filled immediately by Mr Werner Schmidt, a hitherto
low-profile director formerly in charge of overseas operations and
distribution strategy.
Mr Ulrich Seiffert, the research and development chief, lost his place on
the parent board, but he retains his place as R&amp;D director at the Volkswagen
brand subsidiary. His research responsibilities will be taken on by Mr
Gunnar Larsson, promoted last month from the group's Audi subsidiary.
More detailed information on the group's performance and prospects will be
given at Mr Piech's first annual press conference on March 31.
Mr Piech, an Austrian promoted from the leadership of Audi, warned recently
that the German car industry faced its worst crisis since 1945.
The company has already announced plans to shed 36,000 workers to regain
competitiveness. This job-cutting programme is likely to be stepped up and
run in parallel with a squeeze on suppliers masterminded by Mr Lopez.

SHARES in Nike climbed more than 5 per cent yesterday after the company
posted record third-quarter earnings. The shares advanced Dollars 4 1/2 to
close at Dollars 76 3/8.
Although the results were in line with expectations, investors were
encouraged by a jump in 'futures' orders and news that Nike's US footwear
business had its strongest quarter in two years.
The company, based in Beaverton, Oregon, said orders for footwear and
apparel scheduled for delivery between March and July climbed 21 per cent to
Dollars 1.65bn. It warned that these orders were not necessarily indicative
of total revenues for successive periods.
Nike's net income for the quarter to February rose 8.5 per cent to Dollars
89.5m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, from Dollars 82.5m, or Dollars 1.08.
Revenues advanced 12.1 per cent to Dollars 972m, against Dollars 867m.
For the first nine months, Nike's net earnings advanced 11.5 per cent to
Dollars 288.1m, or Dollars 3.74, from Dollars 258.5m, or Dollars 3.38.
Revenues grew 15.2 per cent to Dollars 2.95bn from Dollars 2.56bn.
US sales rose 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 655.7m, while
international sales were 4 per cent higher at Dollars 265.2m.

SHARES in Nike climbed more than 5 per cent yesterday morningafter the
company posted record third-quarter earnings. The shares advanced Dollars 3
7/8 to Dollars 75 3/4 at mid-day.
Although the results were in line with expectations, investors were
encouraged by a jump in 'futures' orders and news that Nike's US footwear
business had its strongest quarter in two years.
The company, based in Beaverton, Oregon, said orders for footwear and
apparel scheduled for deliver between March and July climbed 21 per cent to
Dollars 1.65bn. The company warned that these orders were not necessarily
indicative of total revenues for successive periods.
Nike's net income for the three months to February 28 rose 8.5 per cent to
Dollars 89.5m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, from Dollars 82.5m, or Dollars 1.08.
Revenues were 12.1 per cent higher at Dollars 972m, against Dollars 867m.
For the first nine months, Nike's net earnings advanced 11.5 per cent to

Revenues grew 15.2 per cent to Dollars 2.95bn from Dollars 2.56bn.
In the US, sales rose 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 655.7m, with
growth led by footwear revenues, which were 15 per cent higher at Dollars
548.2m.
The company's total international sales were 4 per cent higher at Dollars
265.2m. The company said international revenues would have been 11 per cent
higher had dollar exchange rates remained constant. Although international
footwear sales slid 1 per cent to Dollars 204.1m in the quarter, apparel
sales rose 25 per cent to Dollars 61.1m.
In Europe, Nike said it was investing aggressively in the Nike brand. The
company expects its fully-integrated automated information systems to come
on line this month. This should provide greater communication and
co-ordination between European countries.

<TEXT>
ELI LILLY, the large US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday said its
first-quarter earnings per share could fall as much as 20.5 per cent before
accounting changes, reflecting slower sales of several important drugs.
Mr James Cornelius, Lilly's chief financial officer, said the company
expected first-quarter earnings, excluding accounting changes, to fall in a
range of Dollars 1.20 to Dollars 1.30 a share, compared with Dollars 1.51 a
year earlier. In the 1992 quarter, Lilly's results benefited significantly
from the sale of its capsule business.
Mr Cornelius blamed the disappointing outlook on slow sales of
anti-infectives because of a relatively mild flu season and increased
competition in the US and western Europe. The company's medical devices and
diagnostics division has also seen sales slide.
Mr Viren Mehta, partner at analysts Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York said: 'Until
recently, it was unheard of to see earnings declines in the pharmaceuticals
industry but we are seeing significant changes in the industry now.'
In addition to concern about drug pricing which has plagued the industry in
recent months, Lilly's performance has been hurt by pressure on sales of its
leading Prozac anti-depressant and the absence of important new drugs in the
pipeline.
On Wall Street, shares in Lilly closed down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 51 3/8 .
The announcement came after the close in New York.
General Mills, the US consumer foods producer and restaurant chain operator
which reported record earnings in the third quarter, expects full-year 1993
to bring record sales, earnings and earnings per share, Reuter reports from
Minneapolis.
In the third quarter ending February 28, General Mills had net income of
Dollars 140.9m, or 86 cents a share, against Dollars 132.1m, or 80 cents, a
year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 2.01bn from Dollars 1.90bn.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Avoiding the pitfalls of
amenity agriculture - Most successful ideas for diversifying farm
enterprises quickly become oversubscribed / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLES BENNETT organises children's parties on his 50-hectare (120-acre)
farm between Oxford and Thame. The entertainment includes pony rides,
looking at lambs, collecting eggs from nest boxes under the free range hens,
treasure hunts around the farmyard and tractor trailer rides around the
fields, all culminating with tea in the hay barn.
The children, who are between three and ten years old - 'they get too
difficult to control after that', says Mr Bennett - love the temporary
freedom of the farm and getting dirty. Parents are only too happy to pay him
for providing the facility. And incidentally, in case any Food Safety
Official begins to worry about Mr Bennett's ability to provide food to the
high standards they require, he insists that the parents provide a picnic.
All he does is to allow the children to eat it in his barn.
This activity comes under the general heading of diversification, which
farmers have been encouraged to explore in recent years as the government
has sought to divert resources from the production of food perceived to be
in surplus. But the truth is that farmers who enjoy having people around the
farm, like Mr Bennett, or who became bored with planting seeds and then
waiting long months for harvest, or, even more likely, needed to increase
their incomes, have been diversifying for years.
Mr Bennett, for instance, has a long record of holding farm open days on
bank holidays and weekends. He also has a farm shop selling produce from the
farm at retail rather than wholesale prices. With only 120 acres from which
to try to derive a living he needs extra income from alternative sources and
I wish him every success with his efforts. But the history of such
initiatives is littered with failures
The classic diversification is farmhouse holidays. Farmers in beautiful
scenic areas, which are, almost by definition, the most difficult in which
to make a living, long ago realised that they had to earn more cash from
somewhere. Some decided to offer bed and breakfast for passing travellers
and signs appeared at farm gates in the hills and moorlands of Britain.
Charges were modest and country-loving guests could not believe the value
for money compared with hotels. Comfortable beds and slap-up farm breakfasts
combined to create a demand for such accommodation and more and more farmers
joined the bandwagon. The number of beds increased, the standard of bedroom
offered rose, in many cases to include en suite bathrooms, the costs of
providing the services rocketed and charges had to go up. In many of those
areas expensive uprated bedrooms now stand empty for most of the year.
It is a classic case of a good idea that has been overdone and it shows how
fragile is the balance between success and failure when diverting resources
from the farmer's basic task of producing food to exploiting a niche market,
which is necessarily more limited in potential.
Another concept that became popular a few years ago but now seems to have
run out of steam is pick-your-own. Fruit-growing is inescapably
labour-intensive. You cannot mechanise the picking of strawberries and
expect them to be of sufficient quality to grace the tea table (although it
is now possible to pick them by machine if they are destined for the jam
pot). And getting the quantity and quality of labour when it is needed has
become increasingly difficult over the years.
Someone, I don't know who, had the brilliant idea that if you could persuade
the public to pick their own you could charge less for it and if they picked
sub-standard produce they would only have themselves to blame.
All through the 1970s and early 1980s the idea spread like wildfire across
the country. But just like b &amp; b it has been overdone, with too many PYO
farms chasing too few customers.
Some PYO farms are still doing well. But many more are closing for lack of
punters, who prefer, it appears, to pay inflated supermarkets prices for the
convenience of having their produce pre-packed.
I should not pretend, however, that I am immune to the temptation to
diversify. Even as I write, the farm men are converting a range of redundant
farm buildings into horse stables in the hope that the local riding
fraternity will want to pay us money to keep their animals in them. Having
seen how easy it is to get it wrong I have no illusions about the dangers.
We are therefore controlling the costs of the investment rigidly.
The one certainty about agricultural diversification is that it will cost
money; but it is by no means certain that it will make money. Even if a
feasibility study suggests that there is potential for a farm to divert some
of its activity in a certain direction there is little doubt that it will be
copied by other farmers and overdone within a few years. Such is the nature
of farmers.
Even the Ministry of Agriculture seems to have got that message at last.
Five years ago the minister launched a scheme to grant aid for
diversification on farms. The money was specifically directed towards
feasibility studies and marketing and 1,500 farmers have so far received
Pounds 8m. There are a further 750 diversifying farmers in the pipeline
whose schemes have been approved but who have not yet had the cash.
But a few weeks ago the prospect of more such grants was withdrawn. For the
fact is that too many farmers try to diversify from financial weakness
rather than strength in the vain hope that it will solve all their problems.
It is said, moreover, that the banks are increasingly warning farmers
against such activities because many of the clients from under whom they are
now having to pull the rug are the ones who have spent big money on
diversification.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: FII launches bid for shoe rival C&amp;J Clark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN FII were suspended at 488p yesterday as Britain's second largest
shoe manufacturer announced it was in takeover talks with a company
identified as its private UK rival, C&amp;J Clark.
The quoted company, with a market value of about Pounds 70m, is believed to
have tabled an offer comprising cash or shares valuing Clark at between
Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m.
FII, which claims about 6 per cent of the UK shoe manufacturing market and
is a major supplier to Marks and Spencer, has been interested in a deal with
the family-held company for some five years. If its bid succeeds, FII is
expected to retain Clark's retailing operation - K Shoes and Ravel.
Meanwhile, Berisford dampened speculation that it was a front runner in the
bidding for Clark. The property and commodities company said it was
exploring the possibility of an offer and no final decision had been taken.
A minority group of Clark's board members, who sought to unseat the chairman
last year, are almost certain to oppose a sale unless the price is at least
200p a share, or Pounds 154m. They are believed to be unwilling to see the
company - which is 70 per cent held by more than 500 Clark family members -
pass out of family control.

BMW Rolls-Royce, the joint venture formed two years ago, has won its second
important order for the BR710 aero-engine it is developing for business and
regional jets.
The joint venture's BR710 engine has been chosen by the Canadian Bombardier
group to power its Canadair global express business aircraft.
No value has been placed on the deal but Bombardier has won 37 firm orders
for its long range twin engine business jet. This could represent about
Dollars 75m worth of business.
The aircraft, which can fly 6,500 nautical miles non-stop at a maximum
operating altitude of 51,000 ft, is due to make its first flight in 1996
with the first customer deliveries starting late 1997.
BMW Rolls-Royce is developing the BR710 family of engines at a new plant
outside Berlin. The joint venture won its first order last September when
Gulfstream of the US ordered 200 BR710 engines worth Dollars 500m to power
its Gulfstream V corporate jet.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Lopez to leave GM after all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors' global buying chief, Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, is,
after all, leaving the US carmaker, it was revealed late yesterday.
His departure was announced at a GM press conference, but it was not clear
where Mr Lopez would be moving to.
Earlier in the day, Volkswagen's shares had fallen on the Frankfurt stock
exchange as it appeared that the German carmaker had failed in its attempt
to poach Mr Lopez.
VW shares slipped DM7.30 to DM285.50 after the weekend's surprise
announcement that Mr Lopez was to stay in Detroit.
An expected fall in VW profits and a cut in the dividend from DM11 to DM5 or
less, due to be confirmed at a meeting of the VW supervisory board today,
had been widely discounted.
GM had been expected to announce at yesterday's conference in Detroit that
Mr Lopez was being promoted to executive vice-president, with much greater
responsibility for the group's North American manufacturing operations.
Volkswagen yesterday repeated that although the company and Mr Lopez had
both signed a contract for him to join the German group within weeks, it
would not come into effect 'for the time being'.
The company refused to comment on speculation that Mr Lopez had been
'persuaded' to stay by a further promotion within GM or the US group's
insistence on his respecting a clause in his contract preventing him from
moving directly to a competitor.
However, Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's chief executive, made plain on Sunday that
Mr Lopez had come under pressure through 'persistent interventions' from
within GM.
This pressure followed a statement last Thursday from Mr John Smith, GM
president, in which he tacitly accepted that he had lost the battle to hold
on to one of his most valuable executives. Mr Lopez's most important
contribution had been 'the organisation of a strategy, a team and a process
to achieve cost-reduction benefits throughout the corporation', he said.
These are precisely the contributions Mr Piech urgently needs to restructure
VW's cost-base and revive profitability.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Olivetti plans rights issue as losses rise sharply to L650bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equipment group, yesterday
announced a L903bn (Pounds 411m) rights issue and said it would report a
sharply increased net loss of about L650bn for 1992.
The cash, to be raised through new shares and convertible bonds, will be
used for expansion, notably in the increasingly linked areas of information
technology and telecommunications.
'In the short term, the money will be used to bring debt down to zero,' said
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman, whose listed CIR holding company
controls the group.
'But we want to use the funds to accelerate Olivetti's development into new
areas,' he added yesterday. Last week, Olivetti took a stake in EO, a
Silicon Valley start-up company marketing 'personal communicators' - pocket
telephones with inbuilt fax and computing capabilities.
Olivetti's 1992 loss, to be announced officially in May, will be nearly 50
per cent larger than the L460bn lost in 1991. Sales fell 6.8 per cent to
L8,020bn and operating losses surged to L230bn from L28bn. But Olivetti's
more aggressive price cutting on personal computers had triggered a 35 per
cent rise in sales in the final quarter, he added.
At the year-end, Olivetti's net debt stood at L960bn. The dividend will be
omitted again, Mr De Benedetti said.
He added that Olivetti faced further heavy restructuring costs of up to
L250bn this year, as it planned to shed a further 3,500 workers. The amount
set aside for restructuring charges fell to L260bn in 1992 from L338bn in
1991, but the actual figure spent was L170bn higher, as it included money
provided for in 1991, Mr De Benedetti said.
He said the rights issue, priced at the shares' nominal value of L1,000,
indicated Olivetti's determination to survive. CIR would subscribe its full
quota, costing about L300bn.
Shareholders will be offered six ordinary shares for every four shares, of
whatever category, now held. Shareholders may subscribe to at least half
their entitlement in the form of new equity, and the remainder as six-year
convertible bonds which will pay interest of between 6 per cent and 8 per
cent, and be interchangeable with the new ordinary shares.

FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC ponders next step in row with US - US
withdrawal from trade procurement talks has put Sir Leon on the spot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EC is studying all options - including retaliation - in response to the
likely US decision on March 22 to bar European companies from winning
certain federal contracts in telecommunications and power generation, the
European Commission said yesterday.
The Commission said Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external affairs,
had yet to choose how to respond to the Clinton administration's unexpected
withdrawal from talks on the procurement dispute due to open yesterday. But
in response to threats of sanctions by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, an EC official said: 'We take him at his word.'
Mr Kantor's abrupt decision to call off talks has escalated tensions already
inflamed by EC-US disagreements on commercial aircraft subsidies, steel
subsidies and the stalled Gatt Uruguay Round. It also has embarrassed Sir
Leon, who had claimed that a recent trip to Washington had cemented
relations with Mr Kantor.
EC officials admitted yesterday that Mr Kantor had failed to make a courtesy
call to Sir Leon ahead of last Friday's announcement. One Brussels official
described Mr Kantor as 'unpredictable', while others said the unilateral
withdrawal amounted to a spur-of-the-moment decision which had surprised the
US negotiating team.
Mr Kantor broke off negotiations after learning that the EC would not waive
Article 29 in the EC utilities directive, which gives European companies a 3
per cent price preference over foreign bidders, while also giving favoured
treatment to EC bidders offering more than 50 per cent local content.
The EC is ready to waive Article 29, but only if the US agrees to waive
buy-American provisions on federal and state contracts in water, gas,
electrical and telecoms contracts.
US demands that the Community waive the clause before yesterday's talks were
tantamount to 'getting us to walk naked into the negotiating room', the EC
said.
Mr Kantor is due to visit Brussels for talks with Sir Leon on March 29, but
the latest row had 'rewritten the agenda', an EC official said.

<TEXT>
Recent turbulence in the European monetary system has resulted in a sounder,
more realistic exchange rate structure, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of
the Bundesbank claimed yesterday, Christopher Parkes writes from Frankfurt.
It was a mistake to interpret events of the past few months as a dramatic
setback for the EMS, he added.
It was also wrong to expect hard currency countries to direct their interest
rate policies primarily towards maintaining exchange rate stability. That
could lead the EMS into an 'inflationary cul de sac', he said in a lecture
in Milan. He also spoke out against changing the rules of the exchange rate
mechanism.

Correction (published 18th March 1993) appended to this article.
DEUTSCHE BABCOCK, the plant and engineering group, posted a 22 per cent
increase in sales in the five months to the end of February but warned that
overall profits for the year would be lower than expected.
Sales in the five months rose to DM2.5bn (Dollars 1.5bn), with the order
backlog standing at DM8.8bn, a 22.3 per cent rise over the same period the
previous year.
But Mr Heyo Schmiedeknecht, chief executive, warned that profit forecasts
for the current year, which ends on September 30, would have to be 'revised
downward'. He said profits would be 'closer to DM30m'. Earlier forecasts
said profits could be as high as DM60m.
Mr Schmiedeknecht blamed the general recession in the industrial machines
sector. He also said that core businesses in environmental technology
continued to be in the red.
Net profits for the group for the 1992 fiscal year stood at DM76m however,
up from DM32m the previous year. Sales for the same period reached DM7.6bn
against DM7.3bn the year before.
Outstanding orders were higher than the previous year, standing at DM7.1bn
against DM6.6bn. The company said it had won a contract worth DM240m to
build a coal-fired plant in China.
The company said it still planned to float three subsidiaries on the German
stock market this year. The plan was announced last year but had to be
delayed because of the stock market turmoil, a company spokesman said.
The three subsidiaries are Balcke-Durr, Babcock-BGH and Schumag, specialists
in mechanical engineering, plant and industrial technology.
The company will also pay a preferred dividend this year, but will omit to
pay on common shares. Holders of preferred stock will receive DM9 a share,
or three times the DM3 a share which was last paid out in 1988.
The company said it intended to turn 1.2m preferred shares into common stock
this year and expected to pay a DM10 dividend for the fiscal year ending
September 30 1994. The plans will be proposed to its shareholders' meeting
on April 5.
CORRECTION
The Financial Times last Tuesday incorrectly reported the forecast dividend
of Deutsche Babcock. The company expects to pay a dividend of DM5 (Dollars
3) on common stock for the fiscal year ending September 30 1994.

FT  16 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) Italy's Corruption Scandal: Debt mountain still
unclimbed amid turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MILAN

<TEXT>
Correction (published 18th March 1993) appended to this article.
THE URGENT economic problems facing Italy are being shunted to one side as a
result of the political turmoil.
The greatest burden is the extremely high level of government debt. Italy's
debt mountain currently accounts for around 107 per cent of the country's
gross domestic product, and the government's deficit forecast of L155,000bn
(Pounds 67.6bn) in 1993 is believed to be on the conservative side.
Even if the referendum on electoral reform on April 18 paves the way for a
more stable government, the reform process is likely to take several months.
Meanwhile, hopes generated by the deficit reduction package agreed last
autumn have faded, as the political storm clouds have cast doubt over its
implementation.
Italy is trapped in a vicious circle: its problem is not only the size of
its debt, but the enormous burden of interest payments, due to high interest
rates.
Unlike the UK, Italy has not benefited from withdrawal from the European
exchange rate mechanism by cutting interest rates because, without high
interest rates, it will not be able to fund its government deficit. However,
unless interest rates fall, servicing of the public debt will continue to
eat up a large part of government revenues.
'If you took away the cost of servicing the debt mountain, Italy would
actually be running a surplus,' said Mr Andrew Roberts, Italian bond analyst
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
In 1990 10-year Italian government bonds yielded 4 percentage points more
than German government bonds, the same margin as existed between the
inflation rates of both economies, so real returns were comparable.
Currently, 10-year Italian bonds are yielding 12.85 per cent gross, 6.3
percentage points more than comparable German bond yields, despite the fact
that inflation in Germany and Italy is now running at the same rate.
As a result of the political turmoil, Italian bonds have largely failed to
benefit from the recent rally in European bond prices, even underperforming
bond markets such as Spain, which is also suffering from economic problems.
'If interest rates were close to where they are in Germany, that would cut
the total deficit of L160,000bn by about 50 per cent,' estimates Mr Steve
Major, a bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities. 'A 1 per cent cut in
interest rates is worth about L15,000bn a year, while 1 per cent economic
growth is worth about L10,000bn.'
Of course, while interest rates remain high, the prospects of economy
recovery will also be depressed.
Italy's debt financing costs have been increased further by the fall in its
credit ratings from the top level of triple-A to double A by Standard &amp;
Poor's and double-A 3 by Moody's, which is considering a further downgrade.
Although these ratings apply only to the country's foreign currency debt,
the impact of repeated downgradings has helped push up Italy's financing
costs across the board.
Even though the cost of foreign borrowing has increased, the Italian
government is likely to continue to borrow in foreign currencies, with lower
interest rates, when such financing is available. Most recently, Italy
raised DM5bn (Pounds 2.1bn) in the Eurobond market. However, the appetite of
international investors for Italian paper will remain limited during the
political upheaval. Meanwhile, a recent Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.6bn) loan by the
European Community provides little more than temporary respite.
CORRECTION
STANDARD &amp; Poor's has asked us to point out that it has never accorded a
triple-A rating to Italy, as was implied in a report on March 16, 'Debt
mountain still unclimbed amid turmoil'. It rated Italy double-A plus until
March 2 1983, when the rating was lowered to double-A.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Mongols study a Japanese model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING emerged from seven decades of communism, Mongolia has sent a group of
parliamentarians to Tokyo to study whether the scandal-prone Japanese
political system should be copied by a country whose voters are mostly
nomadic herders.
The timing of the Mongolians' study tour has let its 10 members witness the
indictment for tax evasion of Mr Shin Kanemaru, fallen from grace as the
all-powerful fixer of Japanese politics and now in a Tokyo detention centre.
Mr Kanemaru's plight and the durability of the ruling Liberal Democratic
party have fascinated officials from the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
party, which recently renounced its communist past and likes to see itself
as Mongolia's LDP. Playing to a pastoral audience during a recent election
campaign, the MPRP promised '104 calves for every 100 cows'.
'We are very interested in the contradictions that created such widespread
corruption,' said Mr Batsuuri, the party secretary. 'We are also very
interested in the cleansing process that allows the Japanese political
machine to go on working.'
Mongolian officials have taken note of the US political system and are
interested in British and German traditions of democracy, but Mr Batsuuri
said that Japan holds special appeal because it is an economic and
democratic success story in an Asian setting.
The Revolutionary party describes itself as a 'social democratic' party and
is one of 'nine or ten parties' in Mongolia: the number has fluctuated with
short-lived coalitions and even shorter-lived parties sprouting each month
since the country's democratisation began three years ago.
Mr Hulan, international secretary of the Mongolian National Democratic
party, the largest opposition group in the Great Khural, the Mongolian
parliament, said the delegation wants to examine privatisation methods and
the Japanese tax system. The interest in tax has more to do with sliding
scales than the alleged evasion of Mr Kanemaru. 'We have found Japanese
politicians and bureaucrats to be very open about their problems,' Mr Hulan
said.
The Mongolians are intrigued by the LDP's factions but amused that their
disputes have nothing much to do with ideology. According to Mr Batsuuri,
the Revolutionary party has factions but they have 'an ideological base'
whereas, in Japan, 'factions are more tied to political personalities'.
Mr Batsuuri said that the Japanese experience does show the advantage of
'consensus-style politics'. The English word 'consensus' has recently
entered the Mongolian vocabulary, as there was not much need for the concept
after the country's communist revolution in 1921.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Brussels to seek fresh impetus for growth package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission is considering fresh measures to stimulate growth
because the response from EC member states remains inadequate, Mr Henning
Christophersen, economics commissioner, said yesterday.
Mr Christophersen said after a meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels
that the Commission may put forward new ideas on promoting investment and
job creation at the EC summit in Copenhagen in June. 'More needs to be
done,' he said.
The Danish presidency of the EC has called for a 'jumbo' meeting of finance
ministers from the Twelve and the six members of the European Free Trade
Area on April 19 in Luxembourg. The aim is to hitch a pan-European effort to
the US recovery in an effort to stem rising unemployment which is
undermining public confidence in the EC.
But only five states - Spain, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, and Denmark - have
put plans to the Commission to bolster the growth package. EC officials said
yesterday that they looked forward to the UK contribution in today's budget.
At the meeting in Brussels, finance ministers hailed the long-awaited
solidarity pact between the central government and Lander to finance German
unification. 'It will pave the way for lower interest rates not just in
Germany but also in the rest of the EC,' said Mr Christophersen. Lower
German interest rates are vital if the EC is to attain the 3 per cent growth
needed to halt unemployment, expected to rise to 17m in the EC this year.
The EC growth initiative combines a modest Community effort to promote
lending to small and medium-sized companies through a new European
investment fund and greater flexibility in European Investment Bank lending
for infrastructure. But the main burden lies in supply-side measures by
member states.
Separately, EC member states approved an ambitious convergence programme put
forward by the Greek government.

FT  16 MAR 93 / N Korea warns of war 'at any time'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH KOREA, facing strong international condemnation over its abrupt
withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, heightened the tension
yesterday by declaring that war could break out 'at any time'.
However, the new South Korean government of President Kim Young-sam appeared
to warn western allies not to react rashly to North Korea's decision to pull
out of the NPT and drive Pyongyang into deeper isolation, which could
provoke a military response.
Mr Ri Tcheul, North Korean ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, said
Pyongyang had ceased to grant visas to foreigners. He claimed that in the
current US-South Korean 'Team Spirit' military exercises, bullets and shells
were being fired 'towards our side'.
'If we respond to it, it will mean a war and this war cannot but be an
all-out war,' Mr Ri said. 'That is why we are stressing that a hair-trigger
situation has been created which could lead to an outbreak of war at any
time.'
In Seoul, President Kim said: 'We never want North Korea to be isolated
internationally nor do we want to inflict suffering on them.' He emphasised
that a diplomatic solution should be found.
Foreign Minister Han Sung-joo told the National Assembly: 'We must prevent
an armed conflict on the Korean peninsula at all costs. . . We don't want
the situation to go to extremes because of the North Korean step.'
Mr Han said South Korea was seeking the help of China, which retains links
with North Korea, to persuade Pyongyang to reverse its decision before the
issue reaches the UN Security Council. Beijing has indicated it is
displeased by the North Korean action.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said he was disturbed by North Korea's
withdrawal from the nuclear treaty, but hoped it would 'reconsider its
position'.
The International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna will hold an emergency
meeting on Thursday to discuss North Korea's refusal to allow inspections of
two sites suspected of being military nuclear facilities.

<TEXT>
THE peacekeeping operation in Somalia that the United Nations is proposing
to begin on May 1, replacing most of the US troops there, will cost Dollars
1.55bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in the initial 12-month period, according to an
estimate given to the Security Council yesterday.
This is more than the official estimate of Dollars 1.41bn for Cambodia, now
the most expensive such UN enterprise. However, the final Cambodian bill is
expected to be nearer Dollars 2bn.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, based the figures for
Somalia on a military force of 20,000 with 8,000 additional logistical
support staff, plus about 2,800 civilian personnel.
In his report he proposed that the General Assembly, which would have to
approve the budget, declares this to be an expense of the entire
organisation shared by all 180 member states, with the US the biggest
contributor.
The cost of the military component of the operation was placed at Dollars
836m, with an additional Dollars 180m for air operations.
It would bring UN peacekeeping expenses for 13 operations this year to a
total of Dollars 4.205bn, about four times the regular budget.
Somalia's feuding factions, clan elders, and religious leaders began
yesterday what has been billed as a 'last chance' to salvage their wrecked
nation, Reuter adds from Addis Ababa.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UN to enter uncharted territory in Somalia: Multinational
force will have to impose law and order in a political vacuum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS troops preparing to take over command from the departing US
Marines in Somalia in May face a near-impossible task.
With most of the country still at the mercy of warring clans and armed
bandits, the 28,000-strong multinational force will be required to impose
law and order in a political vacuum.
This is uncharted territory for the UN. The mandate of the new operation,
code-named Unosom II, will have to go beyond the first small 400-strong task
force, sent to monitor a non-existent ceasefire in Mogadishu, and even
beyond the US-led military intervention in December, which secured a short
breathing space for aid agencies to reach starving Somalis outside the
capital.
Commanders of Unosom II are pressing to be given active rules of engagement
to disarm warlords and bandits, who continue to loot and pillage with
impunity. However, they are aware that military intervention is not a
panacea for the inability of Somalis to start the painful process of
national reconciliation after the traumas of dictatorship and a two-year
civil war.
'If you pulled out the foreign troops and tanks, this place would fall
apart,' says Gen Imtiaz Shaheen, the departing commander of Unosom I.
'Unless the Somalis begin to address their political and social problems, UN
intervention will lead to a new form of colonisation.'
The absence of a Somali government has already created a de facto
administration run by the UN and US task forces and the international aid
agencies. A 'cabinet' meets every morning at 8am at the fortified Unosom
compound in Mogadishu to discuss the security situation and plan relief
work.
The collapse of the economy has also transformed the aid agencies into the
country's main employers and benefactors. The UN's World Food Programme
estimates that more than 2m Somalis, one third of the population, are
dependent on relief agencies for food, water, health care, seeds for
planting, and agricultural tools.
And while the presence of the US-led joint task force afforded military
protection for immediate famine relief work, it has also created a new
security problem for aid agencies. They have become soft targets for bandits
who used to be employed in the protection racket business before the US
Marines put an end to this lucrative source of income.
'Before the US Marines landed,' says Mr Rhodri Wynn-Pope, relief
co-ordinator for southern Somalia with the international agency Care, 'we
were being absolutely ripped off'. Care was paying Dollars 150,000 (Pounds
106,000) a month to security gangs to guard its food stocks at the port.
Other 'contractors' had to be paid to guard food convoys, to negotiate road
blocks, and to prevent food from being looted at its destination.
Military intervention broke the cycle of extortion, but created an
underworld of armed thieves who have murdered three foreign aid workers in
the past two months.
'We feel less secure now,' says Mr Ian MacLeod at Unicef. 'Aid agencies were
not targets last year.' Aid workers, he explains, cannot venture outside
their compounds without armed escorts. All agencies have imposed a 6pm
curfew.
Aid agencies believe that Unosom II's mandate is doomed unless it tackles
the problem of disarmament and rehabilitation simultaneously. 'The banditry
and lawlessness in Somalia is a social problem,' says Mr Wynn-Pope.
'Warlords can talk their men back to the barracks, but bandits need to be
given productive jobs to give up their guns.'
With Somalia's famine emergency over, the UN and aid agencies are beginning
to concentrate on the daunting task of resettling almost 2.5m Somalis
displaced by the civil war. Of these, 1m people are sitting in refugee camps
outside Somalia. Neither the military nor the humanitarian agencies of the
UN have ever undertaken a logistical task of this size.
Relief agencies, critical of the UN's performance in Somalia before the
arrival of the US-led task force, fear that the country will slide back into
anarchy with the pull-out of US troops.
'The US armed forces have a cohesive administrative and logistical command
chain that the UN finds difficult to match,' says Mr Wynn-Pope, himself a
former British army officer. 'US troops were seen as the tough guys with big
guns, whereas the UN has little credibility with the Somalis.'
Mr Jamie McGoldrick, deputy field director of Save the Children Fund UK,
goes further: 'The UN does not understand the scale or the complexity of the
Somali problem. They think it is a six-month job, whereas it may take 10 to
15 years to restore peace to Somalia.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S re-elected Labor prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, yesterday
ruled out a referendum on the abolition of the monarchy until after the next
election, due in mid-1996.
Mr Keating said Labor remained convinced that Australians would not be
'masters of our own destiny' until the 205-year-old link with the British
crown had been broken.
However, constitutional change would require a long period of public debate
and negotiations with state governments, which would inevitably take several
years.
Mr Keating hoped the process could be completed by 2001, the centenary of
the federation of the continent's six British colonies, which many
Australians regard as the foundation of modern Australia.
The prime minister's comments are in line with Labor's 12-year-old
commitment to gradual progress towards the abolition of the monarchy, which
was confirmed by the party's policymaking conference in 1991.
Mr Keating announced last month that Labor would appoint a committee to draw
up plans for the transition to a republic, but the party did not seek to
make the future of the monarchy an election issue.
Confirmation of the timetable for constitutional change will disappoint the
republican movement, which gained strength last year after British criticism
of Mr Keating's handling of a visit by the Queen.
Republicans will also criticise Mr Keating for backing down on a promise to
remove the British union flag from the Australian flag. The prime minister
said a change of flag would have to await the establishment of the republic.
In his first post-election press conference, Mr Keating moved to patch up
relations with Britain. He said Mr John Major, the British prime minister,
had congratulated him on Labor's election victory.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Vietnam Communist party sees writing on the wall: Observers
believe the country will have to abandon Marxism-Leninism in a few years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STATUE of Lenin still stands tall in central Hanoi. A few blocks away
you can go jogging around the lake in what is still called Lenin Park, or
sit on a bench and read stories in the Vietnamese Communist Party newspaper
about fraternal visits by fellow-communists from neighbouring Laos.
Political scientists have noted with surprise how third world communist
regimes, such as the one in Vietnam, have survived the collapse of their
erstwhile patrons in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
Beneath the surface, however, Vietnamese politics is undergoing a change so
profound that Vietnamese and foreign observers believe the ruling party will
be obliged to abandon Marxism-Leninism, transform itself into a broad-based
'nationalist' front, and perhaps even permit opposition parties - all within
a few years.
Party leaders, under Mr Do Muoi, their 76-year-old general secretary,
nowadays barely mention communism or socialism in their speeches. The
2m-strong party, undermined by the collapse of international communism,
finds it hard to recruit new members or to persuade existing members to
attend meetings.
Since the late 1980s, Vietnam has in any case vigorously pursued a policy of
doi moi or 'renovation', a code word for replacing socialist economics with
capitalism, foreign investment and the tenets of the free market.
"When the Communist Party declared its acceptance of the free market
economy, it meant that this party is not truly a communist party; they have
dropped the communist system,' says Mr Phan Dinh Dieu, a mathematician in
Hanoi whose views are tolerated by the party and who is regarded by foreign
diplomats as a sort of licensed dissident. 'The result is that the party is
transformed from a communist party into a party of power.'
Although it is widely accepted that few Vietnamese, even party members,
still believe in communist ideology, the party has tried to smooth the way
for traditionalists by suggesting lamely that sharp changes of direction can
be explained by the addition of the thoughts of Ho Chi Minh (the communist
father of Vietnamese independence in the 20th century) to the policy of
standard Marxism.
'Our slogan is: 'Let the people become rich',' says Mr Tran Kien, deputy
editor of the orthodox party newspaper Nhan Dan (The People). 'Now we carry
out the market economy but regulated by socialism. It means we don't give up
Marxism-Leninism but continue to carry out this ideology including Ho Chi
Minh's teachings.'
The crucial question for Vietnam is whether the ruling party can manage a
peaceful transformation of the political system by steering a path between
resentful communist hardliners and Vietnamese liberals - especially those
living in the US - who demand the rapid creation of a multi-party democracy.
Vietnam's economic performance is certainly helping the transition. Revised
figures for gross national product show the economy grew by a 8.3 per cent
last year, and the country's 70m inhabitants, although still desperately
poor, are becoming visibly more prosperous.
Vietnamese officials say that Russia and other eastern European states made
grave errors by implementing democratisation before economic reform, a
mistake which they believe led to anarchy and a consequent inability to
pursue any economic reform at all: it is hard to find diplomats in Hanoi who
disagree with that analysis.
The flexibility of the Vietnamese Communist party, its genuine nationalist
credentials (in contrast to some of the Moscow-installed parties of eastern
Europe) and the absence of any organised opposition to the cautious
liberalisation it is pursuing, also work in favour of peaceful political
development. To counter the threat of opposition from Buddhist monks, the
party is even said to have spread rumours that Mr Muoi is secretly a
Buddhist himself and has been seen in a pagoda.
'They (the Communist party) know it's over, and they are even discussing
among themselves the possibility of changing the name,' says one Ho Chi Minh
City businessman who used to work for the US-backed South Vietnam government
before the communist victory in 1975.
'They know and the people know it's over, but the idea of a collapse scares
people. They are afraid of bloodshed and chaos, so even the most
anti-communist people want slow change.'
But the party's attempts to manage a peaceful transition to a post-communist
system will probably not go unchallenged. Unemployment, estimated at about
3.5m in urban areas, and widespread corruption in national and local
government are both breeding resentment. Already Vietnamese who must now pay
school fees can be heard complaining that the good aspects of communism -
free education, for example - are being thrown out with the bad.
Party spokesmen are evasive when asked about the future, pointing to the
fact that the 1992 constitution enshrines the party as 'the force leading
the state and society', and falling back on the official policy of
'democratisation within the one-party system'.
Others are more forthright about the imminent demise of the dictatorship of
the single party. Mr Dieu, the free-talking mathematician, believes that the
possibility of alternative political parties could arise in as little as two
or three years. A diplomat in Hanoi says bluntly: 'In five years the
(Communist) party will be nationalist or social democrat.'
A member of the party, a retired senior civil servant, explains how the
party allowed a discussion on political pluralism a year ago. 'Now it's
finished; it was decided that it was not a good idea for Vietnam,' he says.
'But it's not forgotten.'

<TEXT>
MR LI PENG, China's prime minister, yesterday demanded even quicker reform
of the Chinese economy, which grew by almost 13 per cent last year,
prompting concerns about the danger of overheating.
Speaking at the opening session of the National People's Congress, China's
parliament, Mr Li outlined a sweeping programme of economic change aimed at
strengthening market reforms and re-structuring the country's bloated state
sector.
But in a clear reference to concerns about bottlenecks in the economy due to
extremely rapid growth in the past year, he also urged that a 'basic
balance' be struck between supply and demand.
China's economic planners fear renewed inflationary pressures such as those
that undermined reforms in the 1980s. Indications of pressure on prices have
already begun appearing in urban centres where double-digit inflation is
being recorded.
Mr Li's remarks about the economy, which accounted for about one-fifth of a
two-hour speech, amounted to a careful endorsement of reforms initiated by
Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, who was not present at the NPC,
even though he is a delegate.
Mr Li has tended to be identified with conservatives who have not shown
boundless enthusiasm for Mr Deng's market-oriented reforms.
Mr Li also said that:
The economy, which surged 12.8 per cent last year, would continue to grow at
8 or 9 per cent annually, for the rest of the 1991-95 five-year plan. Growth
had averaged 7.9 per cent for the past five years.
Continued growth of 8 per cent to 9 per cent would ensure that China
achieved well ahead of schedule its target of quadrupling Gross National
Product between 1980 and the year 2000.
China planned to slash its giant bureaucracy by about 25 per cent, and
sharply reduce the number of government departments. Little detail was
provided as to how this would be achieved.
China would give particular attention in the next five years to
strengthening infrastructure, service industries and agriculture.
Mr Li, a cautious 64-year-old Soviet-trained technocrat who seems certain to
be endorsed for another five-year term as premier, was unrepentant about the
1989 Tiananmen massacre in which hundreds of pro-democracy activists were
shot by soldiers called in to quell the protests in and around the city's
central square.
'Domestically, in late spring and early summer of 1989, a
counter-revolutionary rebellion caused turmoil in Beijing,' he declared,
adding that China had overcome 'numerous diff-iculties' in maintaining
social and political stability and promoting economic and social
development.
'Our great socialist motherland will stand firm as a rock in the east
forever,' said Mr Li who is blamed by many Chinese for ordering the bloody
crackdown on the pro-democracy protesters.
China's NPC will run for about two weeks and, apart from endorsing revised
economic growth targets, will also approve the election of new leadership
personnel, including the appointment of a president or head of state - a
post expected to be filled by party boss, Mr Jiang Zeming.

THE New York Post yesterday filed for bankruptcy protection and failed to
publish amid a newsroom mutiny over plans to sack about 270 people by the
paper's latest potential publisher, Mr Abraham Hirschfeld.
According to a spokesman for Mr Peter Kalikow, the Post's current owner,
yesterday's Chapter 11 joint filing was part of Mr Hirschfeld's acquisition
agreement. The bankruptcy petition would freeze the Post's debts and help
the paper continue operating.
Property investor Mr Hirschfeld was quoted as saying that he was more
interested in the Post's Manhattan building than the paper itself.

<TEXT>
BUSINESSES, commuters and home-owners along the eastern US seaboard
struggled to return to normality yesterday after a winter storm left a trail
of devastation in its wake and cost up to 115 lives.
In Florida, hard-hit by Hurricane Andrew last August, the storm system
spawned about 50 tornadoes; in the New Jersey, Connecticut and New York
state region around 300,000 homes were left without electricity and up to
17ins of snow were recorded.
In New York hundreds of motorists spent yesterday morning digging parked
cars out from mountainous snow-drifts, many created by the weekend's
snow-ploughs.
East Coast airports were crowded with people trying to get away after being
stranded through the weekend, when the nation's air transport system
suffered one of its worst-ever disruptions.
Major motorways were reopening yesterday, but many smaller roads remained
blocked, with some travellers still snowbound.
Yesterday afternoon, A M Best, the US rating agency which specialises in the
insurance sector, estimated that the storm produced about Dollars 800m in
insured damages. However, some companies said it was too soon to attach a
precise number to claims.
'We just don't know at this stage,' said Allstate, the large Illinois-based
insurer. The American Insurance Association, whose property-claims division
provides industry-wide estimates of catastrophe losses, also said it was
only just beginning to receive reports from member firms.
A M Best suggested the bulk of damage would come in the southeastern states
and central Florida. It estimated that the storm which hit the Northeast in
December was probably more damaging to that region. The December storm
caused more widespread flooding and coastal damage, and resulted in around
Dollars 650m of insured claims.
The latest disaster comes after a run of heavy catastrophe losses for big US
property-casualty insurers and will exasperate the financial pressures on
the industry. The bomb blast under New York's World Trade Centre complex
this month is estimated to have caused over Dollars 1bn in insured damages,
while Hurricane Andrew produced a record-breaking Dollars 16bn-worth of
claims.
In Florida, high winds battered grapefruit and orange crops, and frosts on
Sunday and yesterday caused scattered damage to the fragile flowers that
form next year's harvest, according to Mr Bobby McKown, of Florida Citrus
Mutual, the state's largest growers' organisation. The damage was 'minor' in
comparison to storms and freezes that devastated Florida citrus in the
1980s, he said.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Brazil to resume state sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SELL-OFF dates and minimum prices for two state companies have been
announced by Brazil's President Itamar Franco in a clear sign that the
privatisation programme is to resume after a four-month delay.
Poliolefinas, a petrochemicals company, will be auctioned on Friday at the
minimum price of Dollars 86.1m (Pounds 60.6m). The sale of the National
Steel Company has been scheduled for April 2 with a minimum price of Dollars
1.6bn, despite complaints by its president that it has been undervalued.
The decision to go ahead with the sales represents a policy turnaround for
Mr Franco, who suspended the programme in December after making frequent
criticisms.
Only two weeks ago Mr Antonio Barros de Castro, who as head of the National
Development Bank was responsible for the programme, resigned, accusing the
president of deliberately blocking the process.
Last week Mr Eliseu Resende, the new finance minister, announced a
'deepening and acceleration' of the programme as one of his central
policies. Ministry officials are even discussing with Mr Franco the sale of
assets such as Vale do Rio Doce, the state mining company, and Telebras, the
telecommunications company.
Mr Franco's change of heart was apparently motivated by the discovery of the
privileges and high salaries enjoyed by the state sector and the
considerable costs to the government. This year the state sector will cost
Brazil an estimated Dollars 19bn and pay back a maximum of Dollars 10bn in
taxes.
Mr Fernando Antonio Habda, a member of the economic policy team, said: 'The
President wants to boost government credibility and raise money for social
programmes and buying back debt. He now realises that the only option is
privatisation.'
It is not yet clear what rules will govern the forthcoming sales to meet Mr
Franco's concerns over issues such as the currency used in the auctions.
Only 1 per cent of the Dollars 4bn raised in sell-offs by the former
government was in cash, the rest mainly consisting of domestic debt swapped
at par.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Canada's Tories look to new generation for leader
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S governing Conservatives, seeking to reinvigorate themselves before
this year's general election, are shedding almost an entire generation of
political veterans.
Since Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced on February 24 he was
resigning as party leader, a string of senior cabinet ministers have
declined to enter the race to succeed him.
Several have also said they will retire from politics at the election,
expected in September or October. The rash of departures is partly a
recognition by the old guard that the Progressive Conservative party needs
fresh faces at the top if it is to overcome deep voter hostility. They also
reflect the commanding lead built up by Ms Kim Campbell, defence minister.
The latest Mulroney veterans to pull out of contention for the leadership
are Mrs Barbara McDougall (external affairs), who is quitting politics, and
Mr Bernard Valcourt (employment and immigration).
Other ministers who have dropped out of the race include Mr Don Mazankowski
(deputy prime minister and finance), Mr Michael Wilson (trade and industry),
and Mr Benoit Bouchard (health).
Mr Joe Clark, prime minister briefly in 1979-80 and who most recently
spearheaded efforts to draw up a new constitution, also plans to leave
politics.
Mr Mulroney's successor will be chosen at a convention in Ottawa on June 13.
Senior party officials, including Mr Mulroney, are quietly encouraging
members of the Tory caucus to throw their names into the ring, partly to
generate public interest and partly to deflect unremitting scrutiny of Ms
Campbell.
So far, only Mr Patrick Boyer, a respected but little-known backbencher, has
formally announced his candidacy.
Two youthful cabinet ministers, Mr Perrin Beatty, who holds the
communications portfolio, and Mr Jean Charest, the environment minister, are
still expected to enter the race.

SAO PAULO Alpargatas, Brazil's largest footwear and clothing manufacturer,
suffered a loss of Dollars 83.2m last year, compared with a deficit of
Dollars 37.7m the previous year.
Last year's sales of Dollars 479.2m were down by 11 per cent, with exports
accounting for Dollars 33.3m.
'The loss was principally due to lower sales volumes and tighter margins,
exacerbated by the adjustment of stocks to lower market values and costs
related to company restructuring,' said Mr Diego J. Bush, Alpargatas
chairman, in a stockholder statement.
Embratel, the state-controlled long-distance telecommunications company,
announced profits of Dollars 240m in 1992, up from Dollars 153.3m in 1991.
The company invested Dollars 528m, 80 per cent of which was funded without
borrowing. It plans Dollars 700m of new investment this year, including the
laying of optic fibre transmission lines between some of Brazil's major
cities. Usiminas, the steel producer privatised in 1991, announced profits
of Dollars 123.4m in its first full year as a privately-owned company. The
result was up by 95 per cent from 1991.

FT  16 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Olivetti
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Olivetti's rights issue has the look of a company sticking its finger in the
dyke. The L900bn raised has to be set against a declared loss last year of
L650bn and provisions for restructuring over the last three years of L700bn.
While the issue will wipe out net debt, computer prices are still falling,
so further cost-cutting will surely be necessary. Even Olivetti has tacitly
accepted that investors may not be keen by pitching the issue at the deepest
discount legally allowed.
Larger and more august companies than Olivetti have been humbled by the
collapse in computer manufacturing margins. While further price falls may be
limited as worldwide capacity is cut, it is hard to see European companies
becoming the lowest cost producers against Far Eastern competition. And with
most of the value being added at the chip level by US firms, assemblers such
as Olivetti will struggle. The future of European production is thus far
from certain. Even Olivetti's alliance with DEC may not give it much muscle
in the expanding Risc chip market. DEC, meanwhile, can contemplate its
purchase of a 4 per cent stake last summer at L8,000 per share, which it can
now add to by taking up its rights at L1,000 each.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Thirst for Vimto prompts 8% gain at JN
Nichols
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG SALES of Vimto, the fruit and herb drink, helped JN Nichols report an
8 per cent increase to Pounds 8.36m in pre-tax profits for 1992, on sales
virtually unchanged at Pounds 47m.
The campaign to widen the appeal of Vimto, traditionally the favourite soft
drink of Northern non-drinkers, and an increased contribution from Nichols
Foods helped to offset a decline in contract canning and export sales.
The company said the Pounds 1m decline in exports, a significant proportion
of which are targeted at the Middle Eastern market where Vimto is often used
to break the Ramadan fast, had been due to the timing of deliveries. Ramadan
had fallen later than the previous year.
The group's main export markets continued to grow, however.
In the UK, bad weather last summer had had an adverse affect on sales in the
latter half of the year. Nevertheless, Vimto showed a strong improvement and
the can vending business helped to increase sales.
The final dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 8.5p, for a total 1.3p
higher at 13.6p. Earnings were ahead from 32.6p to 35.4p.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equipment group, yesterday
announced a L903bn (Pounds 411m) rights issue and said it would report a
sharply increased net loss of about L650bn for 1992. The cash, to be raised
through new shares and convertible bonds, will be used for expansion,
notably in the areas of information technology and telecommunications.
'In the short term, the money will be used to bring debt down to zero,' said
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman, whose listed CIR holding company
controls the group.
Olivetti's 1992 loss, to be announced officially in May, will be nearly 50
per cent larger than the L460bn lost in 1991. Sales fell 6.8 per cent to
L8,020bn and operating losses surged to L230bn from L28bn. However, more
aggressive price cutting on personal computers triggered a 35 per cent rise
in sales in the final quarter.
At the year-end, Olivetti's net debt stood at L960bn. The dividend will be
omitted again, Mr De Benedetti said. He added that Olivetti faced further
heavy restructuring costs of up to L250bn this year, as it planned to shed
3,500 more staff. The amount set aside for restructuring charges fell to
L260bn in 1992 from L338bn in 1991, but the actual figure spent was L170bn
higher, as it included money provided for in 1991, Mr De Benedetti said. He
said the rights issue, priced at the shares' nominal value of L1,000,
indicated Olivetti's determination to survive. CIR would subscribe its full
quota, costing about L300bn.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PSA fraud reports rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has been attempting to reassure potential purchasers of the
five Building Management divisions of the Property Services Agency that
suggestions of fraud made about one of the five businesses were unfounded.
Officials at the Department of the Environment were yesterday urgently
talking to prospective bidders for the BM businesses, which carry out most
of the maintenance and upkeep of government buildings.
BM south-east, which is the subject of the allegations, had been proven to
have been involved in only minor irregularities - relating to the
appointment of staff - and they did not include financial impropriety, the
officials said.
The move follows press reports based on a briefing paper prepared for a PSA
internal audit investigation which began in the London-based BM south-east
at the beginning of the year.
The department said yesterday that the paper represented an initial list of
'suspicions and rumours' that had been put to the internal audit team, and
emphasised that the investigations so far had eliminated some of the
allegations. 'It is not true that contracts to the value of Pounds 20m are
being questioned and there is no evidence of any security breaches,' the
department said.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, immediately called for the
sale of BM to be suspended until investigations had been completed. They are
expected to be finished in the next couple of weeks.
But the government made it clear the sale would not be postponed, and it
expects to go ahead with bids from a shortlist of potential purchasers,
probably in June.
The final stage of privatising the PSA was announced in late January, with
expressions of interest from more than 70 businesses, including contractors,
consultants, utilities and building management companies. Last week, on the
deadline for preliminary bids, the department said that there was
'substantial' interest.

TBWA, which was founded in Paris in the early 1970s, is one of the few

claims annual billings of FFr1.1bn (Dollars 196m) has offices across the
continent and a small agency in the US, which has achieved a high profile
for its work for Absolut vodka.
However the international advertising industry is now so competitive that
life has become increasingly difficult for independents. The industry has
been hit both by the recession and by the long term trend for companies to
move away from conventional media advertising towards other forms of
promotion.
Omnicom, which was formed in the late 1980s by the merger of the DDB Needham
and BBDO advertising agencies, has been one of the beneficiaries of the
industry's consolidation. The TBWA acquisition, which is expected to be
finalised in mid-May, is the latest in a series of deals in which Omnicom
has bought up smaller businesses.
These included the UK's Boase Massimi Pollitt agency, which Omnicom acquired
in the late 1980s after the British agency fell victim to a hostile bid from
a French group. Annual billings for the two existing Omnicom networks are
substantially larger than those of TBWA, each standing at around Dollars
6bn.
Omnicom has long been interested in TBWA, and industry speculation about a
deal has been rife. Talks between the two companies are understood to have
been under way for over a year, and analysts have already suggested that by
purchasing TBWA, Omnicom will obtain a strong competitive edge in the
industry.
The advantage to running different agency networks under one group umbrella
is that this allows an advertising company to take on new business which
might otherwise conflict with existing client accounts.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Retailer seeks Chapter 11
protection after sale

A GROUP of US investors yesterday completed the purchase of Herman's, the US
sporting goods retailer, from Britain's Isosceles group - and promptly
sought protection for it from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US
Bankruptcy Code.
Herman's bankruptcy filing was made in Trenton, New Jersey. It was
accompanied by a prediction that the 253-store US chain would lose more than
Dollars 18.5m this financial year.
Isosceles's sale of Herman's was announced last month, but no price was
disclosed.
The investors include Taggart/Fasola, a New Jersey management group, and two
New York investment firms, Whitman Heffernan Rhein &amp; Co and Carl Marks &amp; Co.
They said the Chapter 11 filing would enable Herman's to restructure its
finances and operations.
The US company, with around 6,700 employees in about 40 states, has obtained
a Dollars 40m loan facility from Chemical Bank. It is being made available
as debtor-in-possession financing - a form of temporary funding common in
bankruptcy situations. It allows the lender to rank at the forefront of the
creditors' queue should the borrower eventually cease operations.
Yesterday, the investors said they expected to close or sell a 'significant
number of stores' and concentrate on core markets in the north- east.

SWIRE Pacific, part of the Hong Kong-based aviation-to-property group, is to
increase its stake in Fraser Insurance Brokers, a London insurance and
reinsurance broker, to 80 per cent.
Fraser, in which Swire bought 40 per cent in 1991, will now be known as the
Swire Fraser Group.
Swire will pay Fraser's existing shareholders a percentage of profits earned
by the broker over the next three years in return for the extra holding. No
further details of the transaction were made available.
Fraser specialises in a number of London market areas, including
reinsurance, financial insurances and stop-loss policies - personal
reinsurance policies bought by Lloyd's Names. The group was formed in 1986.

<TEXT>
ANGLIA TELEVISION has entered into three joint ventures with Home Box
Office, a division of Time Warner, to produce and distribute television
programmes and films internationally.
Under the terms of the deal, Anglia and HBO will jointly form Citadel
Entertainment, which will undertake the business of Citadel Pictures,
currently a division of HBO. Anglia will pay Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2.46m) in
two stages for its interest in the new venture.
At the same time Anglia will receive, also in two stages, Dollars 1.5m from
HBO for a 50 per cent interest in International Television Enterprises,
currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anglia.
HBO will also acquire a 49 per cent voting interest in Anglia Television
Entertainment, a new company which will undertake activities currently
performed by Anglia's film and drama department. Anglia will receive about
Pounds 250,000 from HBO, representing some 50 per cent of the value of
Anglia's film and drama programmes currently in development.
The joint ventures are seen by industry analysts as mutually beneficial to
Anglia and HBO, which serves more than 23m pay-cable television subscribers
in the US.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row on prescription charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROCEDURAL manoeuvre by Labour MPs forced Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the
health secretary, to the government despatch box in the Commons last night
to defend an increase in prescription charges.
The 50p rise - from Pounds 3.75 to Pounds 4.25 per item - is due to take
effect from April 1. A Labour attempt to annul the order authorising the
increase was defeated by a government majority of 60 (289-229).
Mrs Bottomley had not intended to participate in the debate, but was left
with no alternative when Labour MPs refused to give permission to Dr Brian
Mawhinney, the health minister, to make the opening and the closing speeches
for the government.
Government claims that only those able to afford it will be required to pay
the higher charge were disputed by opposition MPs.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, described the 13 per cent
increase - eight times the headline rate of inflation - as 'shameful and
disgraceful'.
He called on the government to widen the categories exempt from prescription
charges.
Dr Mawhinney said the increase in the prescription charges - about 10 per
cent in real terms - would raise about Pounds 278m a year for the National
Health Service in England.
He stressed that 80 per cent of all prescribed items were dispensed free -
more than at any time since the charges were reintroduced by the Labour
government in 1968.
Dr Mawhinney angered Labour MPs by saying Mr Blunkett had shown 'outrage,
but no guts' because he had failed to commit a future Labour government to
removing the 50p increase. The minister also emphasised that spending on the
NHS was at a record, with gross provision in England standing at more than
Pounds 30bn in 1993-1994.
He said this amounted to an increase of more than 61 per cent in real terms
since 1979 when Labour left office, and clearly demonstrated the
government's commitment to the NHS.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Clinton sees hope for Mideast peace: Rabin ready 'to take
risks for peace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton insisted yesterday there were 'a lot of reasons to be
hopeful' about a resumed Middle Eastern peace process in Washington next
month.
He said that he had been assured by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime
minister, in the course of over three hours of talks in the White House that
Israel 'was prepared to take risks for peace' and that the US role was
designed 'to minimise these risks'.
But neither leader was able to report a breakthrough over the fate of the
400 Palestinians deported from Israel, a stalemate which is still preventing
Palestinian acquiescence to resumed negotiations.
Mr Clinton said the US stood by the UN compromise arrang-ed last month by Mr
Warren Christopher, secretary of state, providing for immediate return of
100 of the deportees and the rest by the year's end. He said he had not
raised the question of further Israeli concessions on the issue with Mr
Rabin.
Mr Clinton conceded there were 'difficulties' in resuming the peace process.
He hoped that recent violence, including the stabbing of an American
immigrant to Israel, would not prove a serious obstacle.
The prime minister spoke in generalised terms of Israel's willingness to
compromise, including in territorial negotiations with Syria over the Golan
Heights. But he added: 'We are determined to protect our security. We are
willing to compromise but compromise cannot be one-sided.'
Mr Rabin secured a public commitment from Mr Clinton that the US would not
reduce the level of its military and economic assistance to Israel in spite
of budgetary pressures. The two sides also committed themselves to an even
more intense degree of strategic co-operation, including the creation of a
joint science and technology commission.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S ruling Progressive Conservative Party, seeking to reinvigorate
itself before the general election later this year, is shedding almost an
entire generation of political veterans.
Since Mr Brian Mulroney announced his intention on February 24 to step down
as party leader a string of senior cabinet ministers have declined to enter
the race to succeed him. Ms Kim Campbell, the 46-year old defence minister,
now faces virtually no serious challengers. Ms Campbell would be Canada's
first female prime minister.
A successor will be elected at a party convention on June 13, and is
expected to call an election in either September of October.
The rash of departures is partly a recognition by the old guard that the
party needs a fresh set of faces at the top if it is to overcome voters'
deep hostility in the latter part of Mr Mulroney's eight years in office. It
also reflects the commanding lead built up in the early stages of the
succession race by Ms Campbell.
The latest Mulroney veterans to pull out of contention for the leadership
are Mr Perrin Beatty, the communications minister; Mrs Barbara McDougall,
the external affairs minister; and Mr Bernard Valcourt, the employment and
immigration minister.

<TEXT>
JURY selection began yesterday for the first US court trial in relation to
the Bank of Commerce and Credit International affair since the bank was shut
by international regulators on July 5 1991. Opening arguments at the New
York trial - which involves criminal bribery, fraud and other charges
against Mr Robert Altman, the protege and law partner of former US defence
secretary Clark Clifford - are not expected until next week.
Mr Altman, who was indicted last year along with the 86-year-old Mr
Clifford, will stand trial alone since Mr Clifford's lawyers have asked that
his case be delayed because of his poor health.
The trial stems from BCCI-related charges announced last summer by Mr Robert
Morgenthau, the New York district attorney.
Both Mr Clifford and Mr Altman have denied any wrongdoing in the BCCI
affair.

Hypermedia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HYPERMEDIA IS the product of the collision of electronic cultures; radio,
television, voice telephony and computing. It includes futuristic concepts
like hypertext, a variety of automated, electronic encyclopaedia, and
virtual reality, where the subject is transported into an electronic dream
world via a video visor and sensory gloves. A more mundane example is the
interactive video programmes extensively used in education and training.
Understanding Hypermedia: From Multimedia to Virtual Reality by Bob Cotton
and Richard Oliver (Phaidon Pounds 19.95, 160 pages) sets out to explain,
through a kaleidoscope of text and images, how individual electronic media
can be combined to yield a new and revolutionary technology which can be
controlled through language and physical gestures.
The authors believe it will dominate mass culture in the next century.
Pioneers like Ted Nelson and Vannevar Bush have argued that the hypermedia
approach to a topic is closer to the way humans think than the sequence of
information presented in books or films. Aldous Huxley would have felt
vindicated.

WHITE-COLLAR CRIME IN MODERN ENGLAND, 1845-1929 by George Robb Cambridge
Pounds 29.95, 250 pages
HANDBOOK OF CORPORATE FRAUD by Jack Bologna Butterworth-Heinemann Pounds 55,
308 pages
IF THERE were any lingering doubts about the amorality of business life in
Victorian Britain, George Robb's deft history should put paid to them.
Victorian commercial enterprise, with figures such as George Hudson - the
'Railway King' who 'misappropriated securities worth thousands of pounds
from the railways he managed during the 1840s but was never prosecuted' -
was not just shabby in itself. It has also coloured the business ethics of
contemporary society.
The best historiography raises contemporary questions. Robb revisits
familiar territory but he also inserts doubts concerning today's business
practices. For once, the past really does serve as a guide to future
performance.
Robb unearths the close links between government and business in a previous
age. Given that Britain has been ruled by effectively the same
administration for 14 years, his book inevitably suggests comparisons with
today. The temptation for those with political power to abuse it is no less
present in Britain today than it was in 1912, when the Marconi Affair was
neatly swept under the carpet by a parliamentary select committee.
In that incident, 'the Attorney General, Rufus Isaacs, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, David Lloyd George, and the Postmaster General, Herbert Samuel,
all purchased shares in the American Marconi Company at the time in which
Asquith's Liberal government was negotiating a lucrative contract with the
subsidiary British Marconi Company' whose chairman, Godfrey Isaacs, was the
attorney general's brother. Never mind; no abuse happened, according to
other politicians waiting in the wings for their own rewards.
What guarantees have we that ethical standards of government are any better
today? It strongly emerges from Robb's account of previous malpractices that
we cannot be entirely certain, so long as no regulatory divisions exist
between politics and commerce. One constitutional reform to the benefit of
all - except politicians - would be to prohibit all former and serving
politicians from ever holding any company directorships.
Robb argues that little has altered since Victorian times: 'Bankers,
brokers, solicitors, accountants and company directors continued to operate
in a world that was alien and inscrutable to the general public. It was
still difficult (and remains so to this day) to distinguish between fraud,
incompetence, carelessness and misfortune. The rules of the game can be
narrowed, but cheating does not disappear.'
He digs out some surprising support. Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and
Samuel Johnson loathed the parvenus who used paper-proliferation to rob
fools. Johnson defined a stock jobber as 'a low wretch who makes money by
buying and selling shares in the funds' in his dictionary.
At the start of this century, says Robb, 'the obscurity of most published
company accounts ensured that shareholders would remain in the dark
regarding a company's poor financial performance or a director's financial
indiscretions. Even many honest directors believed that shareholders, like
children, should know no more than is good for them, and, like children,
should be deceived for their own good.' What has changed?
The Handbook on Corporate Fraud is aimed more at a US audience, with long
sections on relevant US law and a useful - if depressing - chunk on big
fraud cases, mostly in the US, between 1985-90. It is estimated that
economic crime cost US consumers and businesses Dollars 114bn in 1990, or 2
per cent of GDP. A further Dollars 52bn is annually spent in combating crime
and business frauds.
In spite of its US-inclined content, the book has some universally useful
passages; a checklist of characteristics of fraud-prone organisations,
profiles of embezzlers, tips on fraud auditing and so forth.
Bologna - involved in fraud auditing techniques for many years - says that
'you can prevent white-collar crime by becoming more informed about it and
by applying rules of self-protection . . . be wary of employees who never
take vacations, live beyond their means, or suffer from mood swings.' Not
every chief executive officer can be on the take, surely?

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY by Tom Cannon Financial Times/Pitman Publishing,
277 pages, Pounds 30
A MORE promising book title might be 'Corporate Irresponsibility' given the
potential cast of high-class villains from recent years: Maxwell, De Lorean
and Peter Clowes to name but three. It would be wrong, however, to
under-estimate the interest in Tom Cannon's more worthy subject.
Business ethics, respect for the environment, even affirmative action to
help the disadvantaged are important boardroom issues; they ought to feature
prominently on any MBA course. It must be significant, moreover, that of the
various sub-committees set up by a handful of the great and the good
recently to map out the company of the future, virtually everyone wanted to
be on the one concerned with corporate responsibility.
Guilt perhaps? An eye for the publicity that often accompanies social and
charitable projects sponsored by big companies? Not if you agree with
Professor Cannon that corporate responsibility is much more fundamental,
that it is an integral part of what he calls industry's 'economic contract
with society'.
The form of this contract, he argues, has varied over time and has been
substantially redefined in the 1980s and early 1990s as the frontiers of the
state have been rolled back. For lying behind trends such as privatisation
and contracting-out is a developing consensus that private enterprise is
relatively better able than the public sector to provide most economic and
social needs.
Cannon's proposition that management can deliver its side of the bargain -
that the skills, knowledge and competence exist - is perhaps a touch
generous. Certainly it is in companies' self interest successfully to do so
 -otherwise their contract will presumably be renegotiated to their
detriment by a future generation. But while the book is full of examples of
outstanding companies it is also liberally sprinkled with examples of
boardroom greed, corporate disregard for human health and safety, and abuse
of the environment.
Nor is the link between corporate responsibility and business performance -
an underlying Cannon theme and an article of faith for many practitioners -
altogether satisfactorily established. In view of their recent difficulties
it is perhaps unfortunate that IBM - and even Mercedes Benz - are cited as
business success stories with a good corporate responsibility record.
The value of this well-documented book lies in its historical perspective:
conflicts between industry and society go back centuries, for example, while
the philosophical roots of today's good corporate citizens can be traced to
the Victorian philanthropists and North American progressives (though
generally there is not enough on the US); in its identification and coherent
treatment of the relevant issues (from minority employment and boardroom pay
to the moral dilemma of whether companies should support birth control
programmes in the Third World); and in its enthusiastic advocacy of best
practice.
Professor Cannon may be shooting at a moving target but few can deny his
conclusion that 'part of the contract between the manager, the corporation,
and the community is an acceptance that neither office nor position give
immunity from responsibility. Increasing numbers of corporate leaders
recognise that a secure moral position, respect for the needs of others,
business performance and enterprise quality go together.'

TROUBLESHOOTER 2 by John Harvey-Jones BBC Books, Pounds 14.99, 216 pages
IN HIS latest book, to mark the recent Troubleshooter 2 television series,
Sir John Harvey-Jones looks back at the fortunes of the businesses he
visited in the first series and offers his own brand of consultancy to a
further six organisations - smaller public companies and public sector
businesses.
His impressions of these visits, the background, the experienced,
sympathetic probing and analyses make fascinating reading. The man's natural
curiosity, enthusiasm and charisma are matched by the sort of detailed grasp
one would not associate with the former head of any large organisation, let
alone Britain's largest company, ICI.
The book, even more than the TV series, demonstrates the man's determination
to see a problem from every conceivable angle. Whether he is visiting Tolly
Cobbold, a small East Anglian brewery, Norton Motors or Charles Letts, the
diary manufacturers, he talks to finance directors, production directors,
marketing and sales heads, and to all levels in the factory or workshop,
calls on retail stockists, even meets trade press editors.
In the case of the South Yorkshire Police Force and Bradford Hospital Trust,
he seems even more resolute to get to the root of rather different but still
essentially management problems, but always with courtesy and understanding.
The man is living proof that there is more to life after conventional
retirement age than collecting the odd non-exec directorship, playing golf
and growing better roses. Perhaps he should be pressed into government to
restore our manufacturing strengths.

small businesses

ENTERPRISE AND HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT: LOCAL CAPACITY BUILDING by R J
Bennett and A McCoshan Paul Chapman Publishing Pounds 39.95, 352 pages
THE CONTRIBUTION of small businesses to the UK economy has been given
increasing recognition over the past two decades. What has been only
belatedly appreciated is the need for professional support for these
businesses at the local level.
Meeting the needs of the small firms which make up the bulk of the business
population has important implications for policies towards enterprise,
education and training, the authors of this ambitious study argue. Strong,
locally-based networks of support will have a significant impact on the
country's ability to generate wealth, they suggest. Yet local initiatives
must form part of a common strategy.
The reasons for Britain's relative economic failure have been exhaustively
catalogued by previous commentators. So Bennett, professor of geography at
the London School of Economics, and McCoshan, who works in local government,
merely sketch in the economic background before moving on to a study of the
agencies and programmes which exist.
If Britain is to maintain and improve its standard of living it must not
only do better than it has done in the past, they warn - it must do as well
as or better than the best. In terms of business support this means creating
a network at least as efficient as the best of the continental European
chambers of commerce.
The authors acknowledge that the business community will benefit from
progress which has been made in the areas of both education and training but
point to further improvements which are needed. In education, a better
balance must still be found between vocational and academic needs.
Improvements in the training system, meanwhile, will have to be maintained
for a decade or more if there is to be a fundamental change in the attitudes
of employers, employees, parents and trainers. But it is in the field of
enterprise that most still needs to be done, the authors argue.
At present business is served by a confusing welter of support
organisations, including chambers of commerce, enterprise agencies and
Training and Enterprise Councils (in Scotland, Local Enterprise Companies).
The chambers' strength lies in the fact that they are membership
organisations, but they lack resources. The enterprise agencies have done a
good job helping start-ups but are for the most part narrowly specialised
and also short of funds. The TECs have more money but frequently lack
credibility because they were a government invention.
The organisations which currently exist to back business locally are
fragmented and lacking in resources. There are frequent overlaps, both
geographical and in the programmes they run.
In other respects, though, there are gaps in the provision of services.
Rural areas are poorly provided for and while the very small business is
well served the larger small company - employing between five and 100 people
 -does not get as much help as it requires.
Bennett and McCoshan believe there is a greater role for government as
champion. Self-help alone is unlikely to fill the gaps in the support
framework and there are signs that the limits of voluntary networks have
been reached. Government should provide the core funding to the agencies
which help small business and should help to simplify the present
complexity.
As it happens, the government is already taking action. It announced last
autumn the launch of a network of business advice centres or 'one-stop
shops,' intended to bring together existing support agencies. The first 15
or so are due to start operating next month
The authors welcome this initiative but point to several weaknesses. The
one-stop shops have been provided with just short-term government funding
and since they are not membership organisations, face the same problem of
legitimacy as the TECs. The TECs, which are leading the one-stop shop
initiative, are subject to excessive official scrutiny of their spending
programmes and are still top-heavy with civil servants.
To become truly effective, the TECs/one-stop shops need to be given further
powers and independence, Bennett and McCoshan say. They suggest that this
could be achieved by the introduction of a compulsory registration system
for businesses with a fee charged to all but the smallest firms. This would
provide the one-stop shops with an income and also generate a wealth of
information about business which has been lacking.
The TECs/one-stop shops might even be given a stake in the proceeds of the
uniform business rate. This would re-enfranchise business rate payers as
well as providing an income. These steps would be radical but a stronger
local partnership organisation is the only way of meeting the challenges of
the next century, the authors argue.
This is a well-informed and timely book which deserves a wide readership. At
two-thirds the length and with a lighter, less academic style it might have
reached out to more of the participants in the process of change its authors
advocate.

WIDE-BODY: THE MAKING OF THE 747 by Clive Irving Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds
18.99, 384 pages
DOGFIGHT: THE TRANSATLANTIC BATTLE OVER AIRBUS by Ian McIntyre Praeger
Publishers (dist. by The Eurospan Group) Pounds 34.50, 312 pages
JUST LIKE the new 600 to 800 seat extra-large airliner now being studied by
the world's leading manufacturers, the commercial aircraft industry has
always had a larger than life quality. Every aspect of the business seems to
take on a jumbo dimension: not just the conception and construction of ever
bigger jets with ever bigger engines, but the money, the politics, the
internal infighting and the international repercussions are all of
gargantuan proportions.
Two new books sustain the image. Wide-Body by Clive Irving is a detailed
account of how Boeing risked the entire company to develop and build the 747
jumbo, an aircraft that revolutionised air travel by bringing the world into
everybody's reach and pocket. Dogfight by Ian McIntyre is the byzantine
story of the transatlantic battle over government subsidies for the European
Airbus consortium and trade in aircraft.
Very different in content and approach, the two books are complementary.
Wide-Body tells the early story of the jumbo jet and how it enabled Boeing
to dominate the world commercial airliner market. Considerable research has
gone into this book which dwells at length on the technological challenges
undertaken by Boeing to build the 747.
Dogfight takes the story on with the emergence of the Airbus consortium
providing a concerted European challenge to the American manufacturers and
to Boeing's particular hold on the market for very large aircraft.
This book concentrates less on technology and much more on the international
politics of commercial aviation, with a lively account of the propaganda war
between the US and Europe, of the Airbus animal and the less than orthodox
way of selling aircraft to airline customers around the world. Selling an
Airbus or a jumbo is a bit more complicated than persuading someone to buy a
Mercedes or a Pontiac motor car, Mr McIntyre explains and then goes into
some of the ferocious campaigns fought between the rival manufacturers to
secure a big order from an airline.
The book is more directed to students of the GATT, of international trade
and of opaque accounting and business practices rather than to the aircraft
enthusiast, who will probably find more absorbing the aerodynamic wranglings
of Boeing engineers in Mr Irving's book.
The trouble with writing about the commercial aircraft industry is that you
need to update constantly your material to keep pace with developments. The
747 will soon be superseded by an even bigger jumbo which Boeing has now
agreed to study jointly with the four European partners in the Airbus
consortium, its deadly rival. If the project goes ahead, it will lead to an
entirely new realignment in the aircraft manufacturing industry - which will
tax not so much the fair trade negotiators as the anti-trust experts.

UNION BUSINESS: TRADE UNION ORGANISATION AND FINANCIAL REFORM IN THE
THATCHER YEARS by Paul Willman, Tim Morris and Beverly Aston Cambridge
University Press Pounds 35, 254 pages
MOST OF Britain's unions have normally run on a shoe-string, with low
subscriptions and limited services for the members. Their past strength
derived not from bulging assets but industrial muscle and a constant drive
for new members. Many union officials regarded finance as a sordid affair
and business unionism as a term of abuse.
But as Paul Willman and his colleagues at the London Business School
indicate in their fascinating analysis of trade union finances during the
Thatcher years, the familiar picture of thread-bare unions has changed.
While their membership declined during the 1980s, trade unions saw an
improvement in their financial performance with a growth in their asset
income and fall in 'friendly society' benefits.
The book provides a wealth of topical data on union finances with chapters
on more interesting cases such as the Mineworkers, the Engineers and the
Electricians. But its more general interest lies in its focus on an
important and neglected issue: the reliance of trade unions for their very
survival on the goodwill of employers.
As the authors explain: 'No union we encountered could, in our judgment,
fund day-to-day operations indefinitely from its own resources without
massive subscription increases or exhaustion of assets. All are
employer-dependent'.
Nearly 80 per cent of workers in unions have their dues paid out of their
gross pay packets by their employers in agreement with the unions. This
check-off ensures administrative efficiency and keeps union current accounts
liquid. However, it could decline during the 1990s, as the government's
trade union legislation will make it more costly for employers to
administer.
But what if employers decide they no longer need trade unions? The authors
point out that many unions are no longer 'activist-based voluntary
organisations' and rely on 'inertia-selling'. Breaking free of a reliance on
employers might actually reinvigorate unions in a time of decline.

SUBCONTRACTING ELECTRONICS by David Boswell McGraw-Hill Pounds 27.95, 264
pages
A GROWING number of domestic and multinational companies are sub-contracting
or 'out-sourcing' their electronic manufacturing activities as an integral
part of their corporate strategies.
Based on conservative estimates, contract electronics is already a Pounds
550m-a-year business in the UK and is growing by about 15 per cent a year.
In Europe as a whole it represents the fastest growing sector of the
electronics industry. Customers range from blue-chip multinationals from
both sides of the Atlantic and the Far East, to smaller companies with
perhaps little experience of electronics design and assembly.
However, businessmen without any direct experience of contract electronics
manufacturing face a formidable challenge in deciding whether to 'make or
buy', especially if the jargon of the electronics sector and its technology
is unfamiliar.
Subcontracting Electronics, by David Boswell, a consultant and specialist in
surface mount technology, is a practical guide and manual for executives,
managers and contract negotiators involved in electronic purchase and supply
decisions.
His starting point is the belief that the increasing complexity of system
design and assembly requires a more professional approach from both customer
and supplier. Accordingly, the reader is taken step-by-step through each
stage of the contracting process.
The first two chapters deal with the structure of electronics industry and
the most important factors to be considered in deciding whether to
manufacture an electronic product or sub-assembly 'in-house' or to contract
out the work.
Chapter two identifies the main technological and management theory driving
forces behind the trend towards contract electronics manufacturing,
including the continuing shift towards shorter product cycles,
ever-increasing complexity and the need for greater production flexibility.
Arguably this is one of the most important sections of the book and could
have been longer and more detailed. But although the author, who is also
chairman of the UK-based Surface Mount Club, is clearly an advocate of
contract manufacturing, he presents the arguments concisely. Refreshingly,
he lists the pitfalls and disadvantages as well as the advantages.
Other chapters deal with technologies, contract terms and conditions, how to
choose a contractor and costings. Finally there are three fictitious but
enlightening 'case studies,' and some helpful definitions and abbreviations
for the uninitiated.

MASS CUSTOMIZATION: THE NEW FRONTIER IN BUSINESS COMPETITION by B. Joseph
Pine II Harvard Business School Press, Dollars 29.95, 333 pages
FROM TIN SOLDIERS TO RUSSIAN DOLLS: CREATING ADDED VALUE THROUGH SERVICES by
Sandra Vandermerwe Butterworth Heinemann, Pounds 25, 304 pages
FOR GENERATIONS, Henry Ford's dictum about selling cars 'in any colour as
long as it's black' has been a metaphor for a bygone business era. Yet until
about a decade ago the essential precepts of Fordism, with its single-minded
focus on making large volumes of standardised products as cheaply as
possible for a homogeneous market, remained embedded in much of western
industry.
The Fordist model finally collapsed under external pressures with which it
was ill-equipped to cope: the need to differentiate products in the face of
saturated demand; accelerating technological change and discontinuity; the
advent of new, more agile forms of competition, particularly from Japan; and
above all, the emergence of more sophisticated and discriminating consumers.
The system was further weakened by internal sclerosis. Its preoccupation
with continuous production flows and operational efficiency bred a
lop-sided, introverted management culture. Research and development became
more remote from manufacturing, while the main role of the sales function
was to dispose of whatever the factories chose to produce.
Both books offer a broadly similar analysis of the failings of the old
model. They also agree on the nature of the new challenge confronting
business: to find ways of adding value by meeting the specific needs of
individual customers, rather than merely through the relentless pursuit of
lower production costs. The question is how to meet that challenge.
Joseph Pine, a manager with IBM's executive education centre, argues that
the answer - in both manufacturing and services - lies in combining the cost
efficiencies of mass-production with the variety of tailor-made solutions
which characterised craft production.
His vision may sound fanciful. The strength of his book lies in its deft
amalgamation of rigorous analysis with a wealth of plausible case studies of
companies which have embarked on what most have discovered to be a
never-ending quest for the holy grail of 'mass customisation'.
Some examples, such as Toyota's ground-breaking work in cutting production
cycles and accelerating model development and the story of the Swatch, are
well-known. Others, such as the flexible production system developed by
Bally Engineering Structures, a US building industry supplier, are fresh to
the UK.
Though Pine writes with proselytising zeal, he is realistic about the
pitfalls which mass customisation can face. One is the pursuit of diversity
for its own sake, which either fails to create additional demand or
alienates customers by rendering existing products obsolete too rapidly - a
trap into which some Japanese electronics and car manufacturers have fallen.
Another danger is that too many different product offerings can create
pressures for standardisation, as has happened in computer operating
systems. But then, as Pine points out, such sudden changes of direction are
part of the market turbulence to which 'mass customisation' is supposed to
respond.
The central thesis propounded by Vandermerwe, professor of international
marketing at IMD, a Swiss business school, is that industries must
increasingly think of themselves as providers of services, rather than
producers of things. 'The inroads made by services will continue into the
next millenium. In fact, they are likely to be even more predominant,' she
writes. 'Whereas the service ethos is now the competitive differentiator, it
will become a condition for corporate survival in the future.'
But what does that really mean? The basic message seems to be that producers
prosper by doing what customers want, rather than what suits themselves.
However, Vandermerwe does not advance the debate on the concrete
implications for management much beyond the existing literature on
fashionable topics such as empowerment and teamwork.
Nor is great enlightenment to be found in the book's choice of bite-sized
case studies. Few observers would disagree that Federal Express and SAS are
models of how to create value from customer service. But to commend in the
same breath practices at American Express cards, IBM and Matsushita - all of
which have recently seen their traditional market franchises eroded - is, to
say the least, confusing.

JANE'S WORLD RAILWAYS 1992-93 edited by Geoffrey Freeman Allen Jane's Data
Division, Pounds 135/Dollars 225,826 pages
SHIPPING LINES do not own ports, nor do they control the sea lanes; airlines
do not own airports, nor do they control the air corridors; bus companies do
not own the roads, nor do they control the traffic lights; so why should
train operators need to own the railway tracks and control the signals?
The answer, of course, is that they needn't. But do not try telling that to
a railwayman or his friends. For as long as anyone can remember, railways
have been run as vertically integrated operations; and that, as far as the
railwayman is concerned, is the way they should stay.
Thus Geoffrey Freeman Allen, as good a friend as the railways ever had, gets
fired up to boiling point over Britain's plan to separate track from trains
as part of the privatisation of British Rail. 'It will be astonishing . . .
if any Continental European government, let alone its railway, views this as
better than a dogma-driven exercise, utterly irrelevant to national need of
a well-balanced multi-modal transport system, and a damper of any further
technological exploration of rail transport's potential,' he says in his
foreword to Jane's World Railways.
It is a forlorn cry, and one that scarcely rings true: for as Mr Freeman
Allen is obliged to acknowledge, the reality is that separating tracks from
trains is catching on all over Europe. The Swedes, the Swiss and the
Austrians have already done it, and the Germans, the Dutch and the Italians
are planning it. For many (as for Britain), the long-term intention is to
open up the tracks to private sector train operators in an attempt to inject
competition, enterprise, innovation and investment into the industry.
Huffing and puffing apart, however, this volume remains an indispensably
handy guide to the world's railway industry. Perhaps what is really worrying
Mr Freeman Allen is how long it will remain so; for if European governments'
plans really do succeed in creating a golden age for the railways, the
proliferation of entries for new track and train operators may lead to the
need for a wheelbarrow to carry it around.

BEFORE THE COMPUTER by James W Cortada Princeton Dollars 55, 392 pages
IT CAN sometimes be hard to convince today's young executives, brought up on
a ever richer diet of personal computing power, that a mature computer
industry with its own rules and disciplines existed before the advent of the
Apple II.
James Cortada's book steps back in time to examine a similar phenomenon: the
belief that the modern computer industry grew out of scientific research
during and after the second world war rather than as a logical development
of the office equipment industry.
Cortada's thesis is that the origins of the computer business stretch back a
very long way, encompassing the companies and individuals responsible for
bringing to market typewriters, calculators, tabulators, cash registers and
accounting machines.
'Somewhere today,' he concludes, 'a broken computer is being repaired by a
service representative, just as a broken tabulating machine in the 1920s was
repaired by a customer engineer from IBM or Powers out on a service call.
This is an industry with patterns of behaviour that stretch back a very long
time.'
The author is neither professional historian nor academic but a long-service
International Business Machines executive who now works as an executive
quality consultant for the company. While this gives him a unique insight
into the working of the data processing industry, it may also have inhibited
his style somewhat, especially where Thomas Watson Snr, the maker of the
modern IBM, is concerned.
His account, for example, of the US government's anti-trust action against
NCR, for whom Watson then worked, and which might have resulted in some 22
NCR executives going to jail, is notably even handed compared with other
accounts. (Watson and the others were saved by a flood which devastated
Dayton, NCR's home town. 'The Cash' poured in finance for relief work,
popular support swung behind the company and the government backed off.)
Cortada's main argument is an interesting proposition, however. The
transistor and the personal computer, two of the most important industrial
developments of the 21st century, were not nurtured, in the US at any rate,
by their traditional industries - the thermionic valve manufacturers and the
mainframe computer companies - but by start-ups.
America's first mainframe, the Univac, was marketed by a broadly diversified
office equipment manufacturer, Remington-Rand, after IBM, NCR and others had
failed to show much interest. It took the company from 1950 until 1966 to
turn a profit on its investment.
Inside Cortada's thick, tortuously written book is a thin, lively hypothesis
struggling to be heard. A pity; historians will appreciate the detail. Other
readers may not stay the course.

GLAXO: A HISTORY TO 1962 by R P T Davenport-Hines and Judy Slinn Cambridge
Pounds 55, 406 pages
WHAT PURPOSE do corporate histories serve? Should they be used to create a
tradition, offering a heritage that can provide an inspiration for employees
and managers alike? Should they be used to lift the company's confidence by
underlining the importance of the corporation in society? Should they offer
historians a means of examining larger themes within society - say, economic
imperialism, or the industrial decline of the UK?
Or is their role merely to serve as presents for company guests, and
employment for historians unable to find positions in the UK's shrinking
university system?
Certainly, corporate histories should entertain and inform. Unfortunately,
this volume - a history of Glaxo until 1962 - fails on the whole to
entertain, and provides little information of interest to either the
historian or the general reader.
Yet a history of Glaxo should be riveting. Its origins were humble. A small
family firm, founded by Joseph Nathan, the sixth son of an East End
wholesale tailor with considerable charm and very little brain, eventually
became Europe's biggest drugs group and is now vying for the world's number
one position.
The early days of the company are effectively chronicled. Joseph Nathan was
forced to leave London because of asthma and travelled to Australia and
eventually New Zealand to make his fortune. While in Wellington he became
involved in the butter trade.
A chance encounter in 1903 at Debenham's department store by one of Joseph
Nathan's sons led the family firm into the dried milk industry. The Nathans
spotted an opportunity for drying surplus skimmed milk in New Zealand and
then exporting it to the UK.
The potential market for dried milk was enormous - a decline in
breast-feeding during the late 19th century and the poor nutritional value
of condensed milk had led to an increase in infant mortality - if the
Nathans could solve the technical problems in drying the milk.
They bought a patented drying process for Pounds 10,000 which at first
proved troublesome. Initial sales were high, so they geared up production.
But the repeat business was limited and they ended up with a stock of
unsaleable product. The family wanted to register their new product's name
as 'Lacto', but this was refused by the Trade Marks office; they played with
the name until they came up with 'Glaxo'. But the technical problems nearly
led the family to abandon a product which eventually overwhelmed the
company.
Alec Nathan, Joseph's sixth son, had completed a correspondence course in
advertising and marketing and wrote much of the first promotional material
himself. His innovative ideas included sending circulars to parents of
babies whose births were announced in newspapers. During the first three
months of 1909, the company achieved a 19.6 per cent reply rate.
Those looking for indications of the importance of clinical trials should
look at the impact of the Glaxo milk in Sheffield. In 1907, 445 babies were
given dried milk. Of these 35 died - an infant mortality rate of 7.9 per
cent, compared with the city's normal 14.5 per cent.
Glaxo milk's losses of Pounds 2,191 in 1910 were turned around by 1912 into
a profit of Pounds 2,028. Turnover increased from Pounds 50,000 in 1913 to
Pounds 550,000 by 1918.
However, on events after the first world war the authors appear merely to be
going through the motions and the book loses its way. There is little drive
in the narrative and the analysis of the group's transformation from a
family trading company into a pharmaceuticals concern is poor. Problems such
as the collapse of the dried milk market after the war are mentioned, but
how the company reacted is not explained. The impact of the collapse of
penicillin prices after the second world war is not examined. No full
explanation is given for the fall in profits during the early 1950s, nor the
static results during the rest of the decade.
During the later period, some figures stand out. Alfred Bacharach, a former
Cambridge Fabian, Independent Labour Party activist, rock-climber and expert
in French gastronomy, eventually became Glaxo's chief scientific officer. He
was passionate about syntax and listed 'punctuation' as a recreation in
Who's Who.
But the book finishes before the most interesting part of the story has
begun. No explanation is given of why the volume ends in 1962, before the
Beecham bid in the 1970s and the extraordinary expansion during the 1980s.
The authors may be partly excused by the destruction of some archives during
the last war. But they appear to have made no use of oral testimony. A poor
index, mostly of names, products and countries, rounds off a poor volume.

BEYOND MASS PRODUCTION: THE JAPANESE SYSTEM AND ITS TRANSFER TO THE US by
Martin Kenney and Richard Florida Oxford Dollars 29.95, 410 pages
ARGUABLY THE single most important industrial phenomenon of the past 20
years has been the rise of Japan to dominate many sectors of global
manufacturing, initially by exporting but increasingly through the
establishment of factories in foreign countries. Much has been written about
this achievement, but largely by examining manufacturing processes in Japan
itself, rather than looking at the nation's success in diffusing these
techniques abroad.
Now comes Beyond Mass Production, a study by two US academics, Martin
Kenney, of the University of California, and Richard Florida, of Carnegie
Mellon University, which describes how Japanese companies have established
hundreds of so-called 'transplant' factories in the US and adapted American
workers to their ways. It is a curiously uneven book, blending some useful
description of transplant operations with flights of impenetrable and
pretentious academic prose.
The authors argue that Japanese companies have pioneered a new manufacturing
method (which they call 'innovation mediated production') involving close
teamwork, the breakdown of white and blue collar distinctions, and the
harnessing of workers' intelligence to create constant innovation. This,
they say, marks a distinct and crucial break with traditional US
manufacturing techniques (labelled 'Fordism') where workers are unthinking
cogs in a machine.
All this represents fancy new packaging for some fairly familiar ideas. For
example, the Total Quality Management movement, which is becoming
increasingly popular across US industry, has similar values to 'innovation
mediated production' at its core, learnt from Japan.
Nor do the authors serve their cause well by the quality of their
forecasting. They suggest, for example, that the Japanese economy is set to
enjoy a prolonged boom (whereas the country is now in its worst recession
for 20 years), predict that US car company Chrysler is destined to lose its
independence (when it is in fact staging a dramatic recovery), and make some
highly questionable predictions about Japan's strength in high technology.
Yet amid the irritating, jargon-ridden wrapping there is a useful compendium
trying to get out. The core chapters describe in straightforward prose how
the Japanese have fared in setting up transplant operations in the fields of
automobile assembly and parts, as well as electronics, and invested heavy in
the US steel and tyre industries.
The experiences have been very different in each sector. There is, for
example, a much greater gulf between blue and white collar workers in
Japanese electronics transplants than in Japanese electronics firms in Japan
or in the automotive industry transplants in the US. Even among the car
transplants, there is a big divide between Toyota's smooth-running Kentucky
plant and Mazda's plant outside Detroit, which has a history of poor labour
relations.
Nor, as the authors point out, are the Japanese factories paradise:
'Transplants in various industries impose strict rules on their workers;
some even use methods of intimidation and surveillance to enforce company
loyalty. A few transplants that have tried to get to fill production very
quickly have experienced high rates of injury among their workers.'
The authors note that in nearly every plant they visited Japanese executives
said that one of their greatest problems was teaching American managers to
adapt to their ways, both in terms of commitment to the company and the new,
collegiate style of management. 'The strength of the Japanese system,' they
add, 'is the organic link between managers and workers; this is very
difficult to reproduce in the US with traditional American managers.'
Yet this problem is not confined to the transplants. Several leading
American companies, at the forefront of the quality movement, are also
struggling to find the best way to train a new type of flexible,
non-autocratic middle manager. Getting the right answer may prove one of the
most important factors for success in the new industrial era.

<TEXT>
MOSCOW MEETS MADISON AVENUE by Gary Burandt Harper Business Dollars 22.50,
222 pages
IN THE pre-Yeltsin days, before uncertain freedoms replaced unpleasant
certainties, political jokes in the former Soviet Union had an edge. One
told of an American and a Russian debating which was preferable, capitalism
or communism. Uncle Sam says 'under capitalism, man exploits man.' Vladimir
pooh-poohs such immorality: 'in Russia the situation is quite the reverse.'
Gary Burandt, 'with Nancy Giges', has (unintentionally, I suspect) written a
peach of a book, a perfect illustration of some of the unpalatable truth
lying beneath the old chestnut. Currently chief executive officer with the
Dentsu wing of the US advertising agency Young and Rubicam, Burandt went to
the Soviet Union in 1988 to open its first advertising agency.
Burandt's experiences are not particularly interesting in themselves, but
they unwittingly testify to that warm bath of self-obsession without which
many advertising people are miserable. Young and Rubicam must be proud;
Burandt scarcely lifted his attention beyond a single horizon - the selling
of clients' products.
Burandt and his colleagues are constantly infuriated with the inadequate
resources, the petty corruption, the apparently endless hindrances which
dogged their working days. But the inadvertent delight is the unconscious
manner in which Burandt betrays the paucity of the devoted advertising
person's life, fixated with preaching the virtues of hamburgers, toothpaste,
soap powder and so on.
Thus, while all around him an empire and an ideology are on the verge of
collapse, Burandt reveals a personal crowning achievement at a trade fair,
where he manages to manipulate Mikhail Gorbachev into a commercially useful
event: 'We had the Colgate representative also prepped (prepared) for a
'photo op' with a giant tube of Colgate 'Big Red' toothpaste, the biggest we
had. It worked. He shook Gorbachev's hand and handed him the toothpaste. As
the Big Red box changed hands, a hundred camera shutters clicked as one. One
of the photos would be in the Colgate boardroom in just a few days.' Yahoo]
Young and Rubicam and all the other western advertising agencies which have
since gone east were shoving hard at open doors. Starved of life's material
comforts for so long, former Soviet citizens have always embraced with gusto
anything which brightened up awful lives. Now, at least, they have the ads,
if not the cash to buy those goods the ads promote.

TURNING JAPANESE by Tim Jackson Harper Collins, Pounds 16.99, 254 pages
FOR A British government faced with the brutal combination of a yawning
trade gap and the worst recession since the war, there is a ray of hope in
the gloom. Up and down the UK, brand new Japanese factories are turning out
Toyota cars and Sony televisions for the export drive. But what if this
benevolence masks a fiendish plot? What if the new European single market is
to be overrun by the enemy within?
As Tim Jackson's book points out, we have been here before. In 1968
Servan-Schreiber's Le defi americain raised the spectre of a Europe crushed
by American industry. Then as now, the aggressor was supposed to have unfair
advantages: cheap finance, better links with government and universities,
and so forth. As Jackson also points out, this was not mere paranoia. The
true pan-European car companies are now General Motors and Ford. The true
pan-European computer company is IBM.
The new threat is posed by an extraordinary surge of Japanese investment in
Europe in the past decade. In 1985 new plants totalled 25. In 1989 the
figure was 118 - more than had been established between the end of the war
and 1979.
'What made all this frightening was partly the suddenness of Japan's move
across the globe. But it was also the fact that the sectors in which
Japanese companies appeared to be investing most aggressively - the car
industry, computers and electronics - were precisely the same as those in
which Europe felt itself most acutely lagging behind.'
This is not all. 'It is chilling to note that many of the biggest Japanese
companies have not merely built their transplants from scratch, but have
also deliberately chosen sites far away from other companies in the same
business. This suggests that they consider the problems of the existing
industry so deeply ingrained that they outweigh all the advantages of
joining it. There could be no more powerful reminder of how much European
firms will have to unlearn when they try to reform themselves from within.'
The thesis is thought-provoking, but not wholly proven. As Jackson says, the
Japanese banks made as bad a botch of their expansion in the late 1980s as
did their European rivals. In computing, the Americans are holding a
commanding and increasingly important lead in software. In consumer
electronics, by Jackson's account, the much-battered Philips is fighting its
corner better than its wretched financial record suggests.
And above all, the late 1980s were a very odd time for Japan and Japanese
business. Jackson tackles the issue of the bursting of the financial bubble.
But what he cannot yet say - nor, indeed, can anyone else - is whether the
Japanese financial and industrial machine has suffered lasting damage; nor,
indeed, how far the surge of European investment was merely a product of the
bubble, rather than a long-term shift in strategy.
But it does not do to quibble. The author has worked as a journalist in both
Tokyo and Brussels and has an impressive grasp of many of the big issues
facing global industry. His treatment of them is always clear and often
illuminating. The manufacturer planning an international trip could do a lot
worse than take a copy along.

TRADE WARS: JAPAN vs. THE WEST by Phillip Oppenheim Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson
Pounds 17.99, 241 pages
ASK WESTERNERS why the Japanese have succeeded so spectacularly since the
Second World War and their answer would come back pat: they cheat. The West
is the innocent victim of 'Japan Inc'.
The explanation may be balm to the West's injured pride, but this splendid
book from Phillip Oppenheim, a Conservative member of the British
parliament, demonstrates that the defendant is not guilty as charged. The
Japanese have not succeeded because they cheat, but because they are
exceptionally good at what they do. And what should westerners do in
response? They should do what the Japanese have done: learn from those more
successful than they are.
Mr Oppenheim's book relies heavily on the pioneering work of others, notably
on James Bovard's The Fair Trade Fraud (St Martins Press, New York, 1991).
This does not devalue the book, for it offers a powerful polemic both about
western trade relationships with Japan and about the state of the trading
system as a whole.
Not only is it true, as the author argues, that 'underlying the bleats about
unfair trade is an unholy mixture of greed, hypocrisy and the need for good,
old-fashioned scapegoats', but this particular mixture is explosive. 'The
world trading system is in crisis,' argues Oppenheim, 'its plight caused by
short-term responses to deep-seated economic and industrial problems,
exacerbated by self-serving assertions by industrialists and politicians
that the Japanese have succeeded by unfair means and must be responded to in
kind.'
What then are the reasons for Japanese success? These people actually
believe that 'the prime objective of education should be to equip its people
with the ability to earn a living'; they save twice as much as do Americans;
their taxation is low and their budget has normally been balanced; their
firms compete fiercely; and 'each year Japanese industry spends nearly
Pounds ,7000 in fixed capital investment per employee - twice as much as in
France or Germany and nearly three times as much as in Britain.'
The prowess of Japanese industry reflects 'an open-minded willingness to
adopt the best technology and practices for a given situation; an eagerness
to enter new fields and markets as a means of surviving in the face of
unrelenting competition; the high quality and educational attainment at all
levels of Japanese industry; and a preparedness to take pains to make
employees feel part of their organisation. Above all, there is the seemingly
infinite capacity of Japanese managers to take trouble and to ensure that
the customer is their chief priority.'
The more open-minded western critics of Japan will admit some of this. But
they will also point to the role of government and of 'export targeting'. Mr
Oppenheim notes, in response, that what is unique about Japanese government
is not its interventionism. What is remarkable is that its cajolings have
often worked, the reason being that Japanese intervention has 'generally
been geared to run with the grain of market forces rather than against it'.
Before the ten-foot-tall MITI official replaces the ten-foot-tall Russian as
the chief Western bogeyman, remember that the Japanese government has been
neither all-successful nor all-powerful. 'The list of industries in Japan
which grew without the benefit of any specific or significant MITI support
policy ' argues Mr Oppenheim, 'is extensive and includes sewing machines,
cameras, bicycles, motorbikes, transistor radios, colour televisions, tape
recorders, magnetic tape, audio equipment, watches, calculators, textile
equipment, farm machinery, robots and photocopiers.'
Furthermore, what the West calls export targeting the Japanese might, with
better justice, call comparative advantage. 'The more complex the
manufacturing process and the more it involves a high degree of
organisational effectiveness, the more successful and productive Japanese
industry is relative to the West.'
The list of errors goes on and on. Do the Japanese live in 'rabbit hutches"?
No: 'the average dwelling space for each Japanese - at 870 square feet - is
not much smaller than the average Frenchman's 920 square feet,' in spite of
the shortage of suitable land. Do Japanese firms spend more on research and
development than their western rivals? No: 'In 1989 Siemens of Germany had
the biggest R&amp;D budget of any electronics company bar IBM.' Is the Japanese
market closed? No: plenty of high quality western firms have succeeded
within it.
The lies have both a cause and serious consequences. The cause is that 'the
more industrialists can convince the public how disagreeable the Japanese
are, the more likely they are to win hand-outs and protection from their
governments.' Their call is for 'fair trade", a notion which, Mr Oppenheim
robustly declares, 'is one of the great intellectual frauds of the twentieth
century.' Virtually all the western legislation designed to achieve
'fairness' in trade is just protectionism in fancier bottles.
What then are the consequences? One is that western economic effort will be
misdirected at trying to make Japan more like the west rather than the other
way round. Far more important, however, are the poisoning of peaceful
international relations and the erosion of the liberal trading system.
Western attitudes towards Japan have been worse than a crime. They have been
a mistake, one that must be corrected before it is too late.

FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (12): Vested interests in
the aid trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AID AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE by Oliver Morrissey, Brian Smith and
Edward Horesh Open University Press Pounds 40, 184 pages
THE THATCHER years were not particularly happy ones for British aid policy.
They began with a sharp cut in the aid budget and ended amid controversy
over the use of aid to back exports. One of the central arguments of this
book is that British aid during this period achieved little either to help
the poor in developing countries or even to increase exports.
There was a lot of rhetoric about the commercial value of aid, but some of
the more controversial developments, such as the establishment of the Aid
and Trade Provision, helped only a few exporters with strong links to the
government. Otherwise it was simply a distraction from the low real levels
of aid spending.
Whether or not one agrees with this conclusion, this book serves a useful
purpose. The formulation of aid policy is not something which grabs much
popular imagination even though it is of great importance to Britain's
international relation ships. Despite the cuts aid still involved public
spending in excess of Pounds 1.5bn in 1989.
Policy-making thus needs to be transparent and those responsible for it
accountable. In practice, as the authors point out, aid policy is the
outcome of private lobbying between the various departments concerned: the
Overseas Development Administration, Department of Trade and Industry,
Foreign Office and the Treasury.
Outside influences on them might largely be described as vested interests.
Business is concerned with winning orders. The development lobby, consisting
mainly of academics and voluntary organisations, is suspicious of anything
which does not directly aim to improve the lot of the very poor.
Without books like this one, there would be even less accountability in aid
policy. The authors provide some useful explanations of how the policy
process works. It usefully chivvies the ODA about the secretiveness of its
finances. Its conclusion - that tied aid is not necessarily export-promoting
 -is doubtless valid, even if it is predictable from a set of authors who
identify most strongly with the the development lobby.
The weakness lies more in their tendency to ignore what British aid did
achieve in the 1980s. They note the influence that individual ministers have
had on development thinking: Mr Christopher Patten on the connection to
environment policy, for example, or Baroness Chalker on the role of women,
but there is a reluctance to discuss some other important features of aid
policy during the period.
Thus Britain's support for structural adjustment programmes led by the World
Bank and the reputation, endorsed by the OECD, for quality in its aid
spending do not receive the attention they deserve.
Perhaps the authors are so strongly committed to the development school that
they are innately suspicious of the World Bank. If so they may be
under-estimating the effectiveness of the aid programme's overall
contribution to development.
That is a pity. For unless aid can be seen to achieve something there is
little point in increasing the budget.
One thing on which almost all interested parties, except normally the
Treasury, agree is that Britain spends too little on aid. This book gives a
Chancellor intent on finding any possible way of saving money every
incentive to cut the aid budget further.

GOING GLOBAL: HOW EUROPE HELPS SMALL FIRMS TO EXPORT by William Nothdurft
German Marshall Fund, 11 Dupont Circle, NW, Washington DC 20036
FOR MODERN trade alchemists, the perfect export promotion policy may be the
ever-elusive philosopher's stone. In his quest for this magical device that
might turn base domestic manufacturers into gold-winning exporters, William
Nothdurft calls on fellow US alchemists to look to Europe's practitioners of
export promotion to discover 'the way'.
The breathless voyage across Europe that he charts in Going Global is
fascinating, of immense value to exporters, export organisations and
bureaucrats attempting to define their role in export promotion. But, as
with the original alchemists, he is probably searching in vain.
He is no doubt correct to berate successive US administrations for leaving
export promotion in a muddle. He is also probably right to suggest that
European governments have messed with export promotion strategies more than
the US. But he is probably wrong to suggest that Europe's government's have
in contrast got things notably right.
His pages detail how small and medium sized companies - the principal
targets of export promotion effort - play as marginal a part in Europe's
export effort as they do in the US, suffering the same limitations, and the
same myopias.
As he tracks the immense diversity of programmes tried across Europe, and
reveals how short-lived so many of them are, he unwittingly shows a picture
as riddled with contradictions, as littered with wasted efforts, and as
limited in its success, as he complains of in the US.
A British reader must suspect naivety when Mr Nothdurft opens his book with
a eulogy about London's Docklands, where 'one of the world's great trading
centres is being reborn'. Regular visitors to Docklands will puzzle at when
he stumbled across the 'din of an international airport from which a new
generation of merchants commutes to the trading capitals of a
soon-to-be-integrated European market.'
Mr Nothdurft seems to discern order in Europe where most others see a chaos
not unlike that which he complains about in the US. But this is not to rob
the book of its value. Governments have shown a remarkable inability over
the past decades to discover how best to help exporters, and Mr Nothdurft's
comparison of schemes from the length and breadth of Europe provide valuable
food for thought.

ACCOUNTING FOR SUCCESS: A HISTORY OF PRICE WATERHOUSE IN AMERICA 1890-1990
by David Grayson Allen and Kathleen McDermott Harvard Business School Press
Dollars 35, 373 pages
IT WAS booze that first brought accountants from Price Waterhouse to the US
in the late 19th century, and big bucks that kept them there as their firm
grew into one of the largest practices in the world.
In the 1880s, partners travelled from the London office on behalf of British
brewing companies to investigate potential American acquisitions. By the
early 20th century PW would become an independent firm with twice as many
clients in the Fortune 500 as its next largest competitor.
Over many decades, there were tensions with the partnership in Britain,
which proved highly reluctant to give the US firm autonomy. In 1901 Arthur
Dickinson, the British-born head of the US firm, felt the need to justify
vulgar advertising in the form of a circular to business contacts announcing
his appointment. In a memo to his London partners, he said:
'We cannot afford to sit down and wait for business to come to us as you can
in England; our competitors are all much in evidence . . . even assuming
that we have a better reputation and do better work . . . does not go far
with people like the majority of the Commercial classes here.'
Corporate histories deserve to be handled with extreme care. The degree of
puff makes most of them slip far too easily from the hand. By allowing two
professional writers to do the work, PW took the first step to avoid the
worst excesses of the genre.
Its editorial control over the content of the final copy is less clear. The
sense of independence is not enhanced by a 40-page section listing the name
and date of admission of every partner and principal, and a series of
photographs resembling the corporate equivalent of a family photo album do
not give a good impression of independence.
In fact, the book generally manages to maintain a degree of balance, and
occasionally it manages to drop in slight indiscretions culled from internal
documents and candid interviews with past or present members.
In a profession which is notoriously secretive about its finances, one of
the more interesting revelations is of PW's substantial profitability during
the 1970s. A graph shows that net income as a proportion of fees billed was
held in the range of 20 to 25 per cent between 1967 and 1978.
But there is little in the book that could be used in evidence against PW.
When lawsuits are mentioned, the authors tend to place most emphasis on the
firm's defence and rather less on the opposing view. More generally, they
periodically lapse into unquestioned praise, or assertions that put PW into
a positive light yet which are not justified by their sources. The title of
the book is a prime example. Others include such phrases as 'Price
Waterhouse's illustrious past century . . .
The most interesting theme to emerge from the firm's history is that many of
the issues being debated today in the American profession have been
consistently under discussion for decades.
Perhaps inevitably, the authors spend too much time on PW's contribution
without providing sufficient context of the wider issues facing its
competitors and the professional bodies. Yet on other issues the reader is
left wanting to know more. For example, only a few brief paragraphs are
devoted, and without much analysis, to the reasons for the failed mergers
with Deloitte in 1984 and Arthur Andersen in 1989.
The authors obviously had wide-ranging access to internal working papers
which, frustratingly, are unlikely to be made available to other scholars
seeking their own interpretation. However, shortfalls aside, Accounting For
Success provides a lucid insight into the development of the accountancy
profession and one of its largest players over the last century, and is
certainly a useful addition to the skimpy existing literature.

MELTDOWN by William Houston Smith Gryphon Publishers, Pounds 15.99, 202
pages
FROM TIME to time dogged scientists and economists try to find patterns in
the chaos of long-term data.
You will have heard of Nicolai Kondratieff, a Russian economist under Stalin
who perished in Siberia after predicting that capitalism would revive after
the 1930s depression, benefiting from an underlying 45- to 60-year cycle.
You have probably not come across, however, the work of Raymond Wheeler, a
psychology professor from Kansas who identified a 1000-year climatic cycle,
or the New Mexico scientist Iben Browning, grandson of a Cherokee Indian,
who detected a volcanic cycle of 8.85 years' duration.
Little of this is given much credence by conventional economists and
scientists, but the fact is that such mainstream experts have failed to
predict or explain the worst slowdown in the world's developed economies
since the depression of the 1930s. It is left to fringe writers like William
Houston to explore the reasons for our plight.
Not that Mr Houston is any kind of nutty doomster. He is a practical man, an
engineer and company doctor who several years ago foresaw Britain's current
slump.
In this book he explores the possible reasons for the renewed depression,
although without clearly disentangling the effects of credit cycles from
those of climatic variations with possible astronomical or volcanic origins.
He expects a prolonged depression through the 1990s, and the book is
designed to offer practical suggestions about survival - both physical and
financial.
Lacking a precise theoretical framework the book can seem contradictory: for
instance, Mr Houston appears unsure whether in the US inflation or deflation
is a bigger danger, and in fact he appears to suggest there could be both at
different stages.
In the UK he fears that government income will fall by a third between 1990
and 1994, requiring drastic cutbacks in spending. But he argues that the
government should still aim to balance the budget. It will be up to
entrepreneurs to seize new opportunities and benefit from cheap capital.
His prescriptions range from eminently logical recommendations of new forms
of work to rather dotty suggestions that in a dry climate we should switch
our diet to buckwheat, millet and seaweed (let us hope it does not come to
that).
But at least William Houston is prepared to be unorthodox, and that is
important when the green shoots of conventional economic wisdom have proved
so misleading.

MARKET MOVERS by Mark Jones and Ken Ferris McGraw Hill Pounds 35, 256 pages
MARKETS &amp; DEALERS, THE ECONOMICS OF THE LONDON FINANCIAL MARKETS edited by
David Cobham Longman Pounds 12.99, 183 pages
IN THEIR different ways these two books will be of considerable help to
those seeking initiation into the ways of the City of London and the
financial markets that operate there.
Markets &amp; Dealers is a guide to the City and designed to be read. Market
Movers is a guide to international economic indicators that make prices
move. It is more of a reference book.
That both the main authors of Market Movers include stints with Reuters news
agency on their curricula vitae comes as no surprise, given the lucid
objectivity with which they present their information. One can imagine them
beavering away at their screens to produce those flash announcements of
economic news which have become one of the agency's hallmarks.
It is also refreshing to discover that, far from being content to remain
mere messengers, the authors have actually posed the question of what the
figures mean. The result is this guide to economic statistics in the five
main industrial countries (US, Japan, UK, Germany and France).
The book not only gives details of the source, frequency of publication and
make-up of statistics ranging from GDP to money supply and consumer price
indices, but also some guide as to how they should be interpreted. This
includes assessments on realiability and the impact of seasonality.
Less clear is the relative importance of individual indicators. We are told,
for example, that construction is excluded from the monthly UK industrial
production figures and that production industries accounted for just over
one-third of GDP as of June 1991.
We are not sure what weight financial markets put on this information or how
important it is in comparison with, for example, survey data from the
Confederation of British Industry. Presumably German markets focus on the M3
money supply aggregate because that is the one the Bundesbank watches most
closely. Why the Bank of England - and therefore UK financial markets -
focus on M0, M4 and bank lending is left to the imagination.
With a better evaluation of the impact of individual indicators, the
pointers towards future trends would have more relevance. Still, it is
useful to know that the French Finance Minister normally warns financial
markets if forthcoming inflation figures are significantly outside
expectations. The book says that the Minister 'should always be heeded'. It
would be nice to believe the same of our own dear Chancellor.
One should not be put off by the drear discussion of the economic role of
market makers with which Markets &amp; Dealers opens. It is perhaps necessary
for the authors of such a book to establish their academic credentials even
if the real interest of most readers is likely to be in the book as a
comprehensive overview of the City's working.
Like many works assembled from a multitude of authors, Markets &amp; Dealers
suffers from loose editing. With a little reordering of the material this
book would have become more digestible and its basic strengths more
apparent.
There are few books which combine a description not only of the equity
market after big bang but also of the other large, but lower profile markets
which make up such a large share of the City of London: the eurobond,
sterling bond, futures and options markets and, of course, the money market.
Admittedly, the risk is always that such a guide will date. Though sterling
commercial paper was only launched in 1986, the market has never taken off.
The authors' interest in the subject really does seem rather academic. The
chapter on such a fast moving subject as regulation already leaves something
to be desired in terms of timeliness. Nonetheless, the book has a shelf life
that will help see it through for a while.

FOR GOOD AND EVIL: THE IMPACT OFTAXES ON THE COURSE OF CIVILISATION by
Charles W. Adams Madison Books, Dollars 29.95, 517 pages
IT IS too late now, given that today is UK Budget Day, but perhaps Mr Norman
Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, could have usefully spent his days
of pre-budget purdah in reading - and learning from - this fascinating work
of real scholarship on taxation and the impact of taxes on the course of
civilisation.
Lamont could then post his copy to President Bill Clinton, whose campaign
commitment to ease taxes on America's middle classes has become one of the
first victims of his presidency. In turn, Clinton might do a favour for his
predecessor, George Bush - but then it is too late to unscramble his 'Read
my lips, no new taxes' promise which may have cost him the election.
Perhaps there should even be a copy for Margaret Thatcher, who failed to
learn from English history (including a similar fiscal debacle by King Henry
VIII) and had another go at introducing a poll tax, only to have it
withdrawn by her successor, John Major, albeit without the earlier
parliamentary assertion that such a tax was 'unsuited for England'.
Mrs Thatcher may have been weak on the history of taxation and its
implications through the ages for empires and governments. For anyone in the
same boat - just about all of us - this must be the seminal work.
Just a few nuggets from history. Did you know that biblical Israel split
after Solomon's death because his son refused to cut taxes? That Rome rose
to greatness owing to a liberal tax regime, but declined under inefficient
and corrupt ones? That in Switzerland William Tell was forced to shoot the
apple off his son's head as punishment for tax resistance? That in Britain
Lady Godiva made her celebrated ride naked on horseback through Coventry as
a tax protest? Or that Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the American
Civil war were fired, was a Customs House?
Charles Adams has spent the best part of 20 years researching this
exhaustive work, in part as a teacher of history, but mostly from his
experiences as a tax professional - in the trenches, so to speak. This book
builds on his earlier work Fight, Flight, Fraud: The Story of Taxation
(1982), but For Good and Evil contains much additional material, including a
new chapter on the miracle economies of Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South
Korea and Taiwan, which introduced low-tax, supply side economics long
before Ronald Reagan made it to the White House.
Another new section shows how some US state constitutions seek to protect
taxpayers by given them constitutional controls on taxing and spending,
perhaps the most celebrated being Proposition 13 in California. Adams also
includes a chapter called 'Taming the Monster'; he offers several reforms,
all decidedly pro-taxpayers, to make taxes work for good, not evil.
He wants taxpayers to be able to sue the tax authorities for misconduct and
(in the US) to grant voters recall powers over district directors of the
Internal Revenue Service. His lean is towards indirect taxes and away from a
direct taxation regime, quoting in support from Ancient Egypt, Greece,
Rome,Spain, France, the Netherlands and England before William Pitt and the
introduction of what, in effect, became income tax to finance the war
against Napoleon. It was to be a temporary measure, to be suspended six
months after the war ended. We know better now, and so does much of the
world, since the British have been very successful at exporting the system.
Adams' main conclusions should not be lost on today's governments. Good tax
systems go bad unless citizens are able to restrain administrations which
have a propensity to spend more than they tax; civilisations tend to
self-destruct from excessive taxation; and moderation is an important
principle in the design and implementation of any tax system.
Such moderation includes the choice of tax rates and the penalties for
evasion, the intrusiveness of tax collection, the need to treat taxpayers
equally by avoiding extremes of progressive or regressive fiscal regimes. It
is also important to leave the taxpayers with a sufficient margin to
encourage endeavour and enterprise. Roll on today's Budget.

THE NEW MARKET WIZARDS: CONVERSATIONS WITH AMERICA'S TOP TRADERS By Jack D.
Schwager HarperBusiness, Dollars 22.50, 493 pages
PERHAPS THE most revealing statement in this book comes in the middle of a
conversation between the author and trader Gil Blake.
Schwager asks whether people can buy systems developed by others and use
them successfully. Blake thinks not. He argues that systems are more useful
to the originator than to anyone else and that trading methods always have
to be personalised. Besides, he adds, successful traders do not sell their
systems.
Which rather lets the cat out of the bag. Schwager's book, and its
predecessor Market Wizards, are in the American tradition started by Dale
Carnegie which depend on the idea that you too can make a million simply by
following successful practitioners.
Needless to say you cannot - the most that can be gleaned is the odd tip.
Those who failed to make a fortune from Schwager's first book are unlikely
to do so from his current collection of fireside chats.
The format is also a little irritating. A series of verbatim discussions
offers no opportunity for analysis, save that which flows from the
interviewer's questions. To give the layman any chance of understanding the
jargon-filled exchanges, a large number of explanations also have to be
added in parentheses, breaking the flow.
Nor does The New Market Wizards offer the kind of psychological insight
which made John Train's The Money Masters such compelling reading.
There are some titbits of interesting information buried inside the 500
pages. It is surprising how often the traders' most profitable bets come
when they are convinced that they have to speculate against the consensus.
It is not that they are all permanent contrary thinkers, more that they seem
to have a feel for the right time to oppose the trend.
There is also an intriguing but inconclusive account of how the famous
traders William Eckhardt and Richard Dennis successfully taught classes of
trainees their techniques.
In the end, though, The New Market Wizards offers too much background and
too few insights. Sadly, this series of tape recordings stuck between hard
covers does not even hint at how such highly successful speculators differ
from the thousands of battery-hen traders who sweat it out in dealing rooms
around the world.

THE TRANSFORMATION OF THREADNEEDLE STREET by James J. Fishman Carolina
Academic Press, Dollars 39.95, 301 pages
SOME SEVEN years after the Stock Exchange's 'Big Bang' and the roughly
contemporaneous passage of the Financial Services Act 1986 the regulation of
Britain's financial services industry remains troubled. Several high-profile
prosecutions for fraud have failed, and the regulatory structure for the
investment industry developed under the FSA is plainly not yet in its final
shape.
James Fishman, Professor of Law at Pace University, offers the expert
outsider's view. His interest was aroused while he was a visiting lecturer
at University College, London, in 1986. The valuable contribution of the
foreigner is to add an international perspective to what can be a blinkered
and introverted debate.
Unfortunately, the author sometimes shows a slightly uncertain grasp of the
British scene, not least in the title: he does not appear to realise that
the Threadneedle Street connection relates purely to the Bank of England
rather than to the broader financial services industry. Irritatingly, too,
the map on the front of the dust jacket manages to misspell Moorgate, one of
the City of London's most famous streets. One of the basic themes - the
conflict between the 1980s desire to deregulate the markets, yet at the same
time to improve investor protection - is insufficiently developed.
However, the author has certainly done his homework. He discusses with some
sympathy the development of financial services regulation in the UK in the
1980s, but his final criticisms are fairly devastating.
Regulation of retail investment products such as life assurance should have
remained the responsibility of a separate body, he says, as was the case
right at the beginning before the Marketing of Investments Board Organising
Committee was rolled up into the Securities and Investments Board in early
1986. The SIB itself should focus upon enforcement, which he regards as the
main area of concern. 'Unless the enforcement approach is changed, the next
boom cycle in the financial markets will demonstrate the system's fatal
weakness,' he warns.
Early on there were lengthy battles between the proponents of
self-regulation - the preferred British approach - and those who wanted a
stronger element of statutory regulation on the lines of that implemented by
the US Securities and Exchange Commission. There was in the event great
reliance on self-regulatory organisations, but things began to go wrong.
Sir Kenneth Berrill, the first SIB chairman, failed to build a consensus
through dialogue, says Mr Fishman. A monstrous rule-book of 430 pages
weighing over 4lb had been built up by 1987. The Department of Trade and
Industry under Norman Tebbit and Paul Channon appeared to favour a highly
restrictive rulemaking approach, and the abrupt reversal of this under Lord
Young after the 1987 election did not entirely redeem the situation.
Berrill imposed apparently arbitrary policy choices; the introduction of
polarisation for retail investment products was done even though 'SIB had
not a clue as to the impact of such a change on the life insurance
industry's structure.' Young allowed Berrill's contract to lapse in May 1988
and replaced him with the more communicative and sympathetic David Walker,
an executive director of the Bank.
During Walker's four-year chairmanship there was progress in developing
slightly more user-friendly rules, and tempers cooled. However, the retail
side of regulation remains in a serious mess, to the extent that the third
chairman, Andrew Large, has declared the need for a 'step change' in the
standard of regulation in this area.
James Fishman says that one of the big problems has been the inability of
the SIB to differentiate sufficiently between the wholesale and retail
markets. In the former, unnecessary disclosure has increased transaction
costs and created grievances. But in the latter disclosure is essential to
correct substantial informational asymmetries between buyers and sellers.
His proposed solutions are drastic and, it has to be said, rather muddled.
He recommends that a separate retail investment oversight body should be
hived off, on the general lines of the MIB. The Bank of England itself
should take on general oversight responsibility for financial services
regulation. The SIB itself should focus on enforcement across a wide area of
fraud. 'There is a desperate need for a full-time cadre of mostly career
employees to investigate and prosecute securities fraud,' he argues.
Perhaps so, but he fails to make the case convincingly. There is little
discussion, for example, of the implications for the Serious Fraud Office or
the Fraud Investigation Group. He also appears ignorant of the extent to
which the Bank of England has been damaged by the BCCI affair. However, Mr
Fishman casts valuable fresh light on the continuing contradictions within
the British framework of financial regulation. Changes there will have to
be, even if not necessarily along precisely these lines.

CONSUMPTION AND THE WORLD OF GOODS Edited by John Brewer and Roy Porter
Routledge, Pounds 75, 564 pages
LIKE A vast jigsaw puzzle, this enormous 25-essay volume, ranging from the
encyclopaedic (patterns of English and Anglo-American consumption between
1550 and 1800) to the microscopically detailed (an examination of a
Lancashire woman's habits of consumption between 1751 and 1781) is only
fully satisfying once the final piece slots home.
Here we are in the final years of the 20th century, still without a taxonomy
of consumerism. Perhaps the subject is just too vast. The University of
California at Los Angeles has decided to try to rectify our lack of
understanding and this monster volume - at a monstrous but no doubt
justifiable price - is the first of three on culture and consumption in the
17th and 18th centuries.
Focusing on those two centuries as a perceived moment of shift from
individual into mass consumption - though several of the contributing
scholars question that premise - the presence of Adam Smith quietly
dominates. 'Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production and
the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may
be necessary for promoting that of the consumer. The maxim is so perfectly
self-evident, that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it,' said Smith.
Yet, as Joyce Appleby points out in her contribution: 'Smith was far from
happy with the human propensity to consume, characterising it variously as a
fascination for 'baubles and trinkets', a passion for accumulating objects
of 'frivolous utility' and, worse, a vehicle for deception with the false
promise that wealth will bring happiness.' If the 1980s saw emphasis on the
first Adam Smith quote, the 1990s look like promoting the second.
The contributors pose many important questions, though answers are more
scarce. Part of the effort, well elucidated in the opening section by the
editors, is to find a home within academic exploration for study of all
facets of the consumption of goods, a home which eschews crude Marxism and
does not superficially relegate such a key element of our lives to fashion.
Appleby again: 'Why, in the floodtide of Enlightenment enthusiasms for
freedom - free speech, free inquiry, free labour, free trade, free contract
 -was free consumption never articulated as a social goal? . . . Why is it .
. . that consumption, which is the linchpin of our modern social system, has
never been the linchpin of our theories explaining modernity?'
Part of the explanation for that lacuna might well come from the paradoxes
inherent in consumption, as Roy Porter so entertainingly delineates in an
essay which considers consumption as both health (eating and drinking) and
disease (tuberculosis). 'The dialectics of wealth and waste were worrisome.
Buying and selling were vital for life-giving commerce. Yet what was
spending, but the dissipation of accumulated resources, leading to economic
entropy? Conspicuous consumption was conspicuous waste.'
By the mid 19th century the subterranean revolution from individual to mass
consumption was over and Thomas Carlyle could write with conviction that
'cash payment has become the sole nexus of man to man'. Mass consumption
became used as a means of political hegemony: by 1775 the American colonies
were taking 9,000 different commodities, a trade frequently tied up by legal
prohibitions against alternative sources.
Once started, this ball keeps rolling. Jean-Christophe Agnew quotes a US
soldier from the second world war: 'I am in this damn mess as much to help
keep the custom of drinking Cokes as I am to preserve the million other
benefits our country blesses its citizens with.'
This book deserves to be widely read, for it contains the seeds of something
much greater than its own absorbing research. Sources as diverse as US
trend-spotting gurus and the Japanese advertising agency Dentsu tell us we
are in for a period of extended shunning of mass-marketed consumables, as
purchasers become more interested in individualising consumption habits.
They also tell us that will not be a phenomenon which dies when the
recession lifts. If that is so, then understanding the historical and
cultural roots of mass consumerism will be imperative. This book provides an
excellent starting point.

<TEXT>
CAPITALISM AGAINST CAPITALISM by Michel Albert Whurr Publishers Pounds
14.95, 260 pages
WHEN MICHEL Albert, president of the insurance group Assurances Generales de
France, wrote his book Capitalism against Capitalism, he wanted to warn the
European Community against the dangers of unfettered, US-style capitalism.
His thesis is that in the absence of communism as a realistic alternative,
two strands of capitalism are at loggerheads with each other. In one corner
there is what Albert calls the 'neo-American' model based on individual
achievement and short-term financial gain; in the other is the Rhine model,
of German pedigree but with strong Japanese connections. This model
emphasises collective success, consensus and long-term concerns.
The Rhine model, 'unheralded, unsung and lacking even nominal identity
papers', has shown itself to be the more efficient of the two strands, says
Albert. But in spite of this, the less efficient, more aggressive of the two
variants (the neo-American model) is in the ascendant, representing 'a clear
and present danger'.
To drive his point home, Albert has littered his book with some
astonishingly sweeping claims. Whatever the shortcomings of the US system,
it is hard to take him seriously when he writes: 'It would no doubt come as
a shock to the Brazilian lecturer, the Egyptian intellectual or the Nigerian
don to find out that there is more than one kind of market economy, to be
shown the proof that Rhine capitalism does not follow the same rules he has
seen acted out in last night's sub-titled episode of Dallas - and that its
results are, on the whole, more impressive.'
Or, another example; 'In former times the poor revolted; today, dulled to a
stupor by the drab ordinariness of their squalor (which never appears on
their TV screens), they do not even bother to vote.'
The cavalier way in which Albert advances his arguments is not the only
problem. Its main defect is that the English version (translated by Paul
Haviland) is in need of updating. Albert's thesis, that the neo-American
model is in the ascendant, is rendered less relevant by the day and many of
the book's claims sound dated.
'The veneration of Reaganism has been growing steadily since the mid-1980s.
From Brasilia to Lagos, it is today the very embodiment of the ideals of
success, prosperity and vitality,' he says, in a chapter entitled 'America
is Back' which sets out to show how Reagan's America is spreading its
influence across the globe.
Not even Americans remain devotees of Reaganomics. They have just elected a
President whose economic policy - an investment strategy to stimulate
growth, reduction of the federal budget deficit and reform of the health
care system - smacks more of the so-called Rhine model than the
non-interventionist approach of presidents Reagan and Bush.
Elsewhere too, recession has altered attitudes to economic policy. In the UK
John Major is disassociating himself from some of the more excessive
free-market policies of his predecessor and drifting towards an industrial
policy. The ex-Comecon countries that opened their arms to the
'neo-American' model in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the
Berlin wall are now taking a more sceptical approach.
The author is on stronger ground in his actual critique of the US economic
system. It is surely right to ask why America leads the advanced nations in
drug abuse and crime; why the public education system is 'in tatters'; why
the infant mortality rate is twice that of Japan. He is equally cutting
about the failings of the US financial system, where the short-term
satisfaction of shareholders comes first, to the neglect of research and
development and skills training. This, he says, stands in poor contrast to
the 'well managed consensus' of the Rhine model.
While these questions remain relevant, overall the debate has moved on too
quickly. Recent developments suggest that the two strands of capitalism are
moving closer rather than further apart. In the US, an interventionist
president has been elected while in Europe doubts about the social chapter
of the Maastricht treaty in countries other than the UK suggest opinion is
shying away from excessive regulation.
Meanwhile, it would be interesting to hear Albert's thoughts about the
strains that the recession is putting on that supreme example of the Rhine
model, Germany.

FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): Faded beauty of the
Swedish Model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SWEDISH MODEL by Hans de Geer Carden Publications
Pounds 25, 208 pages
THE Swedish Model seduced the outside world for a long time. For many
overseas admirers the paradigm of the good society - rational, efficient,
progressive - to its enemies it was Aldous Huxley's Brave New World of
stifling conformity and well-meaning authoritarianism.
Swedes themselves saw the Model less as an abstraction or prototype and more
as a way of life in which a dynamic free market economy coexisted
harmoniously with a huge and generous public sector based on high taxes.
This corporatist system worked impressively for nearly 30 years and helped
make Sweden one of the world's most prosperous economies.
Today the Model appears to be drowning beneath the stormy waves of global
recession. Sweden's mounting unemployment, its huge foreign debt and
economic stagnation have combined to undermine faith in the country's
exceptionalism. Now it is having to adjust painfully to outside pressures
with its social and economic integration into western Europe.
But adapt it will. The value of Hans de Geer's book lies in its focus on a
neglected part of the Model, namely its dependence on the active role of SAF
 -The Swedish Employers' Federation. Without the consent of capital it is
difficult to see how the Model could ever have grown to maturity.
Formed in 1902 in reaction to the rise of the LO manual worker union
federation, SAF grew rapidly into a formidable association. With centralised
sanctions over its disparate members and a firm commitment to the absolute
right of employers to manage, it established a common fund to fight strikes
and impose lock-outs. But SAF was never really an anti-union organisation.
On the contrary - as De Geer shows - it agreed to recognise trade unions and
collective agreements from its early days, while in return the trade unions
gave up the principle of the closed shop.
Sweden's industrial consensus was never a flabby middle way but a
hard-headed bargain between capital and labour on their mutual
self-interests. While SAF wanted 'unchanging labour costs' out of it, the LO
favoured solidaristic deals based on wage equality. As the author
emphasises, it was not until the mid-1950s that the central bargaining
system emerged. Over the following 15 years SAF and LO often toured the
world together selling the virtues of the Model they created.
But by the end of the 1960s Sweden's Labour Movement had launched a
workplace reform programme based on legislation, not negotiation, that
brought an end to employer prerogatives, while the rapid growth of the
public sector and arrival of an organised white-collar salariat weakened the
symmetry of SAF-LO bargaining. Wage drift undermined national pay deals and
labour costs grew uncompetitive.
The strain this imposed on SAF was considerable. It brought a clear
ideological shift with a more robust defence of free markets. In more recent
years SAF began to shed its corporatist ways and champion decentralised pay
bargaining. Its leaders talk more boldly today than they used to do about
competition and private enterprise.
But this is all a matter of degree. What de Geer calls Sweden's 'negotiation
culture' remains intact beneath the surface of its industrial life. The
power balance has shifted more towards employers and away from unions, but
not dramatically so. As the book makes clear, continuity remains as strong
as change in Sweden. The Model may after all just be having a face lift.

FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): Hammer horror story -
The man behind the Occidental myth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DARK SIDE OF POWER: THE REAL ARMAND HAMMER by Carl Blumay with Henry
Edwards Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 20, 494 pages
'THE ONLY way to build the future is to build it on lies' was the maxim of
Armand Hammer, the founder of Occidental Petroleum, who died in 1990 at the
age of 92. According to Carl Blumay's chronicle, Hammer rarely departed from
that principle.
Blumay should know. Now in his 70s, he was in charge of public relations for
Armand Hammer and Occidental for 25 years. He devoted every minute - and his
marriage - to constructing the public image that Hammer was a business
genius, a philanthropist and humanitarian, with influence over the Kremlin
and the White House. The reality, Blumay says, was a backstage drama of
bribes, manipulation, huge financial losses, a gun-toting delinquent son and
a collection of high-cheekboned mistresses on both sides of the Iron
Curtain.
When Blumay took his place in the drama in 1955 he reckoned that the
American public 'hungered for a business hero who satisfied the requirements
of the Faust legend: a capitalist with the fame and charisma of a movie star
and a thirst for power and wealth that made him willing even to sell his
soul to achieve his dreams, and that's how I decided to sell him.'
Selling Hammer meant putting out to the stock markets a stream of press
releases which inflated the value of Oxy's oil reserves. It meant helping
the company to stonewall the Securities and Exchange Commission's many years
of investigations - Oxy's executives were relieved when the SEC found only a
fraction of the 'questionable payments' that it suspected. It meant helping
hide for years one of Occidental's most damaging secrets - now seen as one
of America's worst pollution disasters - that the company's subsidiary
Hooker had contaminated land and water tables across the US with thousands
of tonnes of poisonous chemical waste.
Not all of Blumay's campaign was successful. The stock market rapidly became
hostile to Hammer's authoritarian style. On the day that Hammer slipped in
the bathtub and cracked three ribs, Occidental's market value rose by
Dollars 306m; when he died it rose by nearly 10 per cent.
But the only time when Hammer was touched by real fear of reprisals,
according to Blumay, was when accused as part of the Watergate prosecutions
of illegal payments to Richard Nixon's US presidential re-election campaign.
Overnight he exchanged his compulsive travelling between the Soviet Union,
Libya, Venezuela and California for the sanctuary of a cardiac ward. Forced
eventually to present himself in court, he appeared in a wheelchair, huddled
inside an over-large suit, wired up to heart monitoring equipment and
surrounded by lawyers who threatened the judge with lawsuits if he
collapsed. Let off with a fine, he threw away the chair and danced a victory
jig. As he said to Blumay, his body was just another corporation - and he
was in control.
Although Hammer professed that 'money is my first, last and only love', like
many tycoons he was remarkably good at losing it.
Blumay catalogues how money was frittered away on attempts at deals with the
Soviets that never stood a chance of being successful. 'He worships the
Soviet leaders because they have the kind of power he craves', Blumay told
Hammer's pet biographer.
That unprofitable courtship is just one of the many uncanny echoes of Robert
Maxwell's life, despite Hammer's proclamation that 'there has never been
anyone like me - and my like will never be seen again'. Like Maxwell, he
denied for years that he was Jewish but changed his mind shortly before his
death, despite his persistent refusal to put pressure on the Soviets to
allow Jews to leave. He left it late, though: the bar mitzvah he had planned
had to be rapidly altered to a memorial dinner.
People were drawn to work for him, as they were for Maxwell, not just by the
money but by the mischievousness of entering a world which ignored normal
rules. One executive is reported to have been 'amused by the idea of bugging
a call from the President'. According to Blumay, the sacrifices were heavy:
one executive was sent to jail, and Hammer's Russian mistress may have been
murdered because of the connection.
But Blumay is weak on the motives of Hammer's followers beyond describing
them as 'moths to a flame'. More important, he says little of his own
reasons for helping Hammer mislead the outside world for so long and then
for writing this book. He pleads at the start: 'If his were errors of
commission, mine were errors of omission'. The question is whether his
account can now be believed.
The sources throughout the book are few and hard to corroborate: largely
Blumay, Hammer himself - referred to familiarly as 'Armand' - and Hammer's
brother Victor, now dead. The book's reproduction of entire paragraphs of
Hammer's speech over three decades is implausible, and many of the
allegations of bribes are unsubstantiated. Nor is Blumay informative on
where the money came from to build the empire, despite a smattering of
references to stock issues and bank loans. The suspicion is that he never
knew the financial details.
In spite of insisting that he was 'forced to question the credibility of
everything (Hammer) told me', Blumay shows little sign that he did so. He
can be astonishingly incurious: one journalist's tip that Hammer had mafia
connections is brushed off in the phrase 'no matter what Armand had been up
to in 1934'.
The book is most convincing not on the details of chicanery, but on
recreating the distortions of Hammer's paranoia and arrogance. The SEC,
Colonel Gaddafi and Venezuela's President Perez are first magnified as
enemies bent solely on Hammer's destruction, and then swatted away as
insignificant gadflies.
This account, which is exhaustingly chronological, is in the end gripping
mainly because of the sense that eventually the truth will out. But that
happened just weeks after Hammer's death, long before this book's
publication, when financial reality forced Occidental to sell about Dollars
3bn of assets and write off Dollars 2bn against profits.
Blumay, who eventually resigned, clearly belongs to the class of
'disgruntled former employees' whose comments Hammer instructed the world to
ignore. Blumay says that in his experience these executives normally told
the truth. In his case, while the product of his pique is entertaining, it
still leaves room for a definitive book telling the whole truth about Armand
Hammer.

FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: US storm damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The massive damage wrought by what are seen as the worst storms across the
east coast of the US this century led to an initial marking down of a UK
composite insurance sector buffeted in recent years by a series of natural
disasters, capped by last year's Hurricane Andrew.
But the markdown and ensuing selling pressure proved shortlived as insurance
specialists concentrated instead on the likelihood that the latest disasters
would trigger the long-awaited upturn in US insurance premiums. The
performance of shares in the biggest US insurance groups when Wall Street
opened gave credence to London's view that premiums would almost certainly
be raised. General Re was up around Dollars 2 5/8 , Marsh &amp; McLennan 1 1/8
firmer and AIG over a point higher shortly after the US market opened.
General Accident, whose US catastrophe reinsurance is triggered if losses
rise above Dollars 40m, was seen as possibly the worst affected, and the
shares settled 8 off at 589p. Royal, with a reinsurance trigger level of
Dollars 25m, rallied sharply to end 9 ahead at 305p after an early fall to
293p. Commercial Union, with a reinsurance mark of Dollars 15m, managed a
minor rise to 607p. Sun Alliance, which has negligible exposure to the US,
rose 11 to 350p.
Industrial group IMI, which reported a decline in profits, moved sharply
forward, with the market cheered by the held dividend. The shares gained 11
at 270p in trade of 3.3m.
In spite of an upbeat analysts meeting, many remained sceptical about the
prospects for the current year and several moved to downgrade full year
profit expectations. These Included Mr Sandy Morris at NatWest Securities,
who trimmed his 1993 estimate by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 71.5m. He blamed the
cut on the continued weakness in the rest of Europe, where the company
derives around 37 per cent of operating profits, and IMI's moderate exposure
to the recovering US economy.
The signing of a joint venture agreement for cigarette production in the
Ukraine led to positive sentiment in BAT and the shares put on 8 at 956p.
Transfer Technology continued to be the subject of strong demand, following
the recent favourable figures. The shares added 33 at 558p. Vague hints of a
sell recommendation for Gestetner left the shares 12 lighter at 118p.
English China Clays rose 5 to 458p after reporting a maintained dividend.
British Airways firmed 3 to 298p ahead of confirmation that its Dollars 300m
investment into USAir has been cleared by the US government. Volume came to
3m shares.
Bid talk returned to a generally positive property sector, with Hammerson
once again the name touted as a possible target. However, one dealer
suggested that a stock shortage in one type of the group's shares had
triggered buying in the other as the two had moved apart, inflating the
rise. By the close the ordinary shares had jumped 21 to 387p and the 'A's 26
to 361p.
The building materials sector, among the market's worst performing areas
last week, staged a good rally amid hopes of a cut in German interest rates.
Wolseley moved ahead 17 to 583p, RMC 12 to 588p and Redland 10 to 455p.
Second line store issues did some catching up after Friday's strong session
for the leaders. T &amp; S Stores rose 5 to 164p, Amber Day 6 to 62p and Body
Shop 6 to 190p. The decision by Argos to close its loss-making Chesterman
furniture stores lifted the stock 9 to 295p.
There was renewed bid talk around Geest and the shares jumped a further 12
to 480p. A US food group is rumoured to be on the prowl.
Weekend press comment benefited Perkins Foods, up 7 at 113p, and United
Biscuits, ahead 5 at 383p.
A buy note from Paribas on Queens Moat Houses helped the shares advance 4 to
49p in turnover of 5.6m. The French-owned broker believes recent weakness to
be overdone and that the stock is poised for recovery. Two small but
loss-making leisure stocks, European Leisure and Whitegate Leisure, both
moved back into the black. The former rose 1 1/4 to 5 1/2 p and the latter 5
to 27p.
The recent run of big turnovers in Amstrad continued, with 11m traded
yesterday as the stock gained 2 1/2 at 38p - its highest level since June
last year. This week sees the expected launch of the company's latest new
product, a 'personal digital assistant' computer.
Delta advanced 9 to 444p following the maintained dividend, while GEC
rallied after last week's slide and settled 6 1/2 ahead at 300p; Phillips &amp;
Drew Fund Management said it no longer had a notifiable interest in GEC
shares. Shareholdings in excess of 3 per cent have to be made public,
according to the Stock Exchange rules.

FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: HSBC strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continuing wrangling over political reforms ahead of the handing over of
power in Hong Kong in 1997 caused only a mild ripple of unease in shares of
HSBC, holding company for Hongkong and Shanghai Banking and its merged
Midland Bank. HSBC was among the best performers on the London market after
it revealed a much better than expected final dividend.
The Hong Kong market itself came under heavy pressure after Chinese
officials attacked British proposals for the colony, causing a general
marking down in London of leading UK groups with significant interests in
Hong Kong.
HSBC's profits were slightly disappointing, according to dealers, but the
dividend was ahead of the most optimistic forecasts, pitched around the
15.5p to 16p mark.
The shares were tentatively marked up to 609p by dealers wary of the steep
retreat on the Hong Kong market. Buyers moved in quickly, however, and drove
the stock up to a close of 624p for a net gain of 20. Turnover was a good
7.7m.
Other leading UK stocks heavily influenced by events in Hong Kong performed
relatively well. Standard Chartered settled a net 4 higher at 704p
ex-dividend, while Cable and Wireless, which derives more than half of its
earnings from Hong Kong, settled only a fraction off at 712p, having fallen
to 698p at the outset of trading. Inchcape rose 5 to 588p.

FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Owners raided by Cook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for control of Owners Abroad, the UK tour operator fighting a
hostile Pounds 290m bid from its smaller rival, Airtours, took a new twist
yesterday as Thomas Cook made an early raid in the market to capture an 8.4
per cent stake in Owners.
The move by Thomas Cook, which is controlled by German travel group LTU,
adds further spice to the bid battle which many in the market believe is now
too close to call. The Airtours offer closes today at 1pm. Last week, Thomas
Cook made a tender offer for 12.5 per cent of Owners at 150p a share
conditional on the Airtours bid lapsing.
Dealers suggested that Thomas Cook may have purchased its stake from UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, paying 152 1/2 p a share for lines of 9m,
2.1m and 1.9m shares. However, leisure specialists said the fact that the
institution was considered supportive of the present management meant that
the dawn raid changed little in the complex arithmetic over who was likely
to win.
But there were also suggestions that Gartmore Investment Management had sold
a 1.3 per cent share interest, part of its 7 per cent stake in Owners, to
Thomas Cook. It was enough to unsettle some investors, worried that the
German move implied a shift in favour of Owners' current shareholder
supporters, who have so far been seen in the market as losing the public
relations battle to Airtours. Owners closed 9 down at 138p after turnover of
28m. Airtours slipped a penny to 338p.
Crucially, the Thomas Cook stake combined with the holdings of Owners'
directors is now more than 10 per cent and will prevent Airtours from going
over the 90 per cent required for full control, even if its offer succeeds
today. It also sent analysts home speculating over Thomas Cook's strategy in
the event of an Airtours victory, with some suggesting that it might attempt
to buy some parts of Owners' operations.

FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer ahead of the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRADING week likely to be dominated by today's Budget speech in the UK
parliament, but also by hopes for cuts in interest rates both in Germany and
in Britain, made a confident start yesterday. Ex-dividend adjustments in
several blue chip shares restrained the day's gain in the FT-SE 100 Index to
6.5; but for these technical factors, the rise would have been twice the
reported figure.
Equity strategists expect Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, to announce some fairly moderate tightening of fiscal policy
today, but believe he will avoid any risk of jeopard-ising the fragile
recovery in the UK economy; economic optimism was encouraged by news that UK
manufacturing output increased by 0.8 per cent between December and January.
At the same time, a further cut in UK base rates is certainly 'on the
agenda' and London has become significantly more confident of a reduction in
German rates following the recent trimming of the Bundesbank's money market
rates.
Early falls in the Footsie reflected the ex-dividend adjustments in such
leading names as ICI, Barclays, RTZ and Abbey National. Hardly a sector was
immune from these pricing factors and the Footsie dipped 7.2 to within 9
points of the 2,900-mark in early trading.
However, with the March future on the FT-SE 100 Index still positive with
only a few days' life left in the contract, shares soon rallied and moved
slowly ahead. At best the market was more than 12 Footsie points up, before
interest died away towards the close of the final pre-Budget trading session
in equities.
The closing reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,922.4 for a net gain of 6.5.
Seaq trading volume slipped to 578.1m shares from Friday's 769m. But all the
signs have been that retail, or genuine investor, business in equities has
remained high, reflecting improved confidence in prospects for economic
recovery and further interest rate cuts. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 12.5
at 3,112 yesterday, and non-Footsie business made up nearly 72 per cent of
the day's total.
On Friday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.54bn, bringing a total of
Pounds 8.78bn for the week. The increased level of retail business has now
extended for the past five months and has significantly improved levels of
profitability among London-based securities firms.
Underlying confidence in the outlook for interest rates across Europe was
reflected in gains in shares in UK property and building and construction
companies yesterday. Rises were strongest in UK building groups with
interests in Germany. London's hopes of lower rates in Germany were not
discouraged yesterday by a repetition of strong anti-inflation views by the
president of the Bundesbank.
A further indication of the positive mood underlying the stock market came
from bid-related activity, both in the leisure and property sectors. A
market raid was mounted on shares of Owners Abroad by Thomas Cook, the
German-owned travel agency, ahead of today's closure of the Pounds 290m
hostile bid by Airtours.
The latest developments in Hong Kong were outweighed for UK investors by
profits and an excellent dividend payout by HSBC Holdings.

FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DERIVATIVES sector once again experienced an uneventful session as
dealers waited for the outcome of today's Budget speech from the UK
chancellor, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the first trade in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index,
now in its last week of trading, was struck at 2,924, some 4 points above
last Friday's close.
Early buying saw it rise to the day's peak of 2,935 at around 10am, after
which the contract drifted lower with little follow-through buying. General
profit-taking saw it fall back to 2,925 over the lunchtime period.
The low of the session at 2,915 was seen just before the opening of Wall
Street, after which March crawled forward on bargain hunting and the
firmness in New York.
It closed at 2,921, a slight discount to the underlying cash market. Dealers
said the day's turnover of around 10,000 contracts in March was due to
rolling forward into the June contract. It saw volume of 5,556 lots.
Traded options were also dull and saw volume of 26,281 by the close of
business. Trading in the FT-SE 100 option was very poor indeed, reaching
only 3,907 lots, while the Euro FT-SE 100 option had business of 1,037
contracts.
Amstrad led the way among stock options, trading 1,788 contracts with the
September 35 puts the busiest series, followed by British Gas at 1,507.

FT  16 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies in spite of fresh
drop by bonds
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US STOCKS traded in a narrow range yesterday, holding on to modest gains in
spite of another fall in bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 14.59 better at 3,442.41, the high
for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 picked up 1.60 to 451.43 and the
Nasdaq composite improved 2.43 to 695.21. New York SE volume was light by
recent standards at 195.9m shares, and rising shares outpaced declines by
1,033 to 834.
In the wake of Friday's fall in equity prices, the share markets proved
their resilience yesterday by opening firmer, with prices showing solid
gains across the board in the first 30 minutes of trading.
But the gains proved primarily a knee-jerk reaction to the previous
session's losses. In the absence of fresh economic news, the markets
struggled to find a direction, allowing prices to slip back for a time from
their highs. Sentiment was undermined, also, by a sudden downturn
mid-morning in the bond market, where inflation-sensitive investors took
fright at a sudden rise in commodity prices.
Equities, however, were supported by continued strong inflows of cash as
investors showed few signs of turning away from stocks, which they view as
offering the best potential returns in the low interest-rate environment.
Nike jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 76 3/8 after the sports shoe and
apparel maker reported fiscal third-quarter net income of Dollars 89.5m, up
from Dollars 82.5m and a record for the company. Although the profits were
slightly below market expectations, investors were impressed by reports that
Nike's orders for the next few months were 21 per cent above the com-parable
period a year ago.
Although bank stocks, troubled by rising interest rates, recovered from
early weakness, BankAmerica failed to rally, ending Dollars 1 3/8 down at
Dollars 52 3/8 . The stock was weighed down by ratings downgrades from two
securities firms, Sanford Bernstein and CJ Lawrence. Vehicle shares were
lifted by news of strong car and truck sales for the first 10 days of March:
General Motors firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 7/8 , Ford Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 48 7/8 and Chrysler Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 3/8 .
Brokerages were higher because of the heavy demand for their services from
individual investors, which is boosting commission revenues and asset
management profits. Merrill Lynch rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 73 5/8 ,
Charles Schwab Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 and PaineWebber Dollars  3/8
to Dollars 26 1/8 .
Storage Technology, which rose sharply on Friday, added Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 27 1/8 in volume of 2.2m shares on hopes that testing of the
company's Iceberg data storage system is progressing well.
Canada
THE TORONTO market finished higher following moderate-to-heavy trading,
boosted by a modest late-afternoon rally after showing little movement
earlier in the session.
The TSE 300 index gained 14 points at 3,562.0 and rises outnumbered falls by
324 to 289. Volume amounted to 43.6m shares valued at CDollars 358m.
Eleven of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by the gold shares sector, up
1.8 per cent as the bullion price rose in New York by USDollars 1.20 to
USDollars 329.35 an ounce.

FT  16 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Political backcloth to global equity
shifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politics provided the set for last week's drama on some of the world's
equity markets.
While Hong Kong fell sharply after Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor,
enraged the Chinese on Friday by saying that he was to press ahead with
democratic reform proposals, Australia rose, anticipating a change of
government. Japan provided support for the 2 per cent gain in the
FT-Actuaries world index, as the Nikkei average closed the week at a
six-month high.
The slide in Hong Kong continued yesterday, with the Hang Seng index having
lost some 8 per cent over the two days. However, many analysts believe that
the worst is now over and anticipate short term support at the 5,800 level.
Most of the selling has come from domestic investors, with foreign
institutions remaining on the sidelines, they comment; and the excellent
results from HSBC have refocused attention on the underlying strength of
corporate earnings.
Regarding Mr Patten's efforts to seize the political initiative with his
proposals to extend democracy, Mr David Bates of Asia Equity comments that
there are doubts whether they will even win the support of the Legislative
Council. As yet a date has not been set for debate but, says Mr Bates, there
are indications that the LegCo is evenly divided.
Australia rallied as investors anticipated defeat for Mr Paul Keating and
his Labor government; but Labor, having clinched victory, the equity market
yesterday lost 2 per cent.
Mr Peter Wade of brokers JB Were in London commented that expectations that
the Liberal/National party would seek further rationalisation of the banking
sector and privatise other public sector companies had driven the market
higher in the pre-election weeks. Nevertheless, with the likelihood of cuts
in interest rates and corporate tax the downside in the market would
probably be limited.

FT  16 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Agreement on 'solidarity pact'
lifts senior bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the slump last Friday afternoon on storm signals in Russia and the New
York equity market, bourses mostly recovered yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Sentiment, especially in Germany, France and Switzerland, was lifted by the
weekend conclusion of the German 'solidarity pact', involving agreed
political, corporate and trade union initiatives in the financing of German
unification.
FRANKFURT looked undecided, the DAX index ending 4.57 lower at 1,702.57. But
this obscured the recovery from the tumble share prices had taken on Friday
afternoon.
Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, of James Capel in Frankfurt, said that on the Ibis
screen system, share prices yesterday afternoon were running 1 1/2 per cent
of Friday evening's with Deutsche Bank DM11 higher at DM723 against an
official close of DM720.80, down 20 pfg.
Turnover fell from DM6.8bn to DM6.2bn. Exceptions to the solidarity
celebration included Volkswagen and Hoechst, which closed DM7.30 lower at
DM285.50, and DM4.80 down at DM249 respectively.
Over the weekend, VW lost a senior management prospect as General Motors's
J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua announced he would stay with GM. VW subsided
further to DM283.60 in the aftermarket on industry indications that the
carmaker's dividend would be cut from DM11 to DM2 for 1992, rather than the
expected DM4 or DM5.
Hoechst hit more trouble when its Frankfurt plant suffered an explosion
early yesterday, the chemical group's fourth accident in Germany in the last
month.
MILAN reacted fairly calmly to news that Iri, the state holding group, was
to take a L340bn loan from its telecommunications subsidiary Stet in
exchange for granting it the dividend rights for three years in another of
its subsidiaries, Banco Commerciale. The Comit index, on the last day of the
March account, lost 5.82 to 508.42.
In spite of the slight losses, Stet down L13 at L2,174 and Commerciale off
L170 at L4,830, some analysts commented that the news placed doubts on the
success of the government's privatisation programme: with Stet holding some
52 per cent of Commerciale's equity it was now problematic how the latter's
planned privatisation could proceed.
Olivetti was the day's other story, although the shares were suspended at
L2,202 pending its surprise announcement of a L900bn rights issue. Mr John
Stewart of Pastorino commented that the group, in effect, was seeking the
new funds to rebuild its net assets after sustaining losses of over L1,100bn
during the last two years.
PARIS strengthened on hopes of easier European interest rates and the CAC-40
index closed 20.80 firmer at 1,986.03. However, turnover was relatively thin
at FFr2.3bn.
Interest rate-sensitive stocks were the day's main gainers in the absence of
fresh corporate news. Euro Disney advanced FFr2.40 to FFr89.35, also helped
by the warm weather which has recently boosted attendance levels. Paribas
rose FFr6.20 to FFr422.20 and Suez was up FFr6.20 at FFr320.90.
AMSTERDAM recovered from Friday's losses with a gain in the CBS Tendency
index of 1.3 to 105.5. Wolters Kluwer, the publishing group, which reports
1992 earnings today, stood 80 cents higher at Fl 89.80. Analysts expect the
group to see an improvement in last year's results of between 15 and 20 per
cent.
Fokker put on 20 cents to Fl 11.20 and announced that it was delaying
publication of its 1992 earnings, which had been due on Thursday, until
April 2 pending confirmation that the takeover by Deutsche Aerospace was to
proceed.
ZURICH took its recovery mainly in chemicals and Nestle as the SMI index
rose 28.1 to 2,157.0. Roche gained SFr80 to SFr4,090 on anticipation that
the company will simplify its share structure and will post good 1992
results, and Nestle rose SFr30 to SFr1,160.
Banks were firmer on interest rate hopes, although CS Holding stood out with
a rise of SFr40 to SFr2,270. Insurers were weak on fears that storms in the
US would lead to high claims, Swiss Re losing SFr60 to SFr3,120 and
Winterthur SFr40 to SFr3,320.
STOCKHOLM remained subdued as investors awaited tomorrow's vote of
confidence in the government. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 11.4 to
1,001.1 in turnover of SKr533m, down from Friday's SKr635m. Procordia, the
food and pharmaceuticals group, went against the trend, rising SKr2 to
SKr190, still helped by last week's publication of good 1992 earnings.
HELSINKI was pulled lower by financial difficulties facing construction
company Polar and the Hex index fell 28.2 to 963.1. Repola, which has a 12.9
per cent stake in Polar, lost FM4.30 to FM56.70. OSLO, however, strengthened
with a gain in the All Share index of 8.02 to 442.61, for a rise of some 10
per cent since March 4.

FT  16 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Basin in ferment
as Nikkei rises again

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices fluctuated on technical activity, but the Nikkei average
finally registered its seventh consecutive gain, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 48.66 higher at 18,086.18. It fell to the day's low of
17,957.16 in the morning and rose to the session's high of 18,169.16 in the
afternoon, before fluctuating on arbitrage trading.
Volume fell to 350m shares from Friday's 771m. Advances led declines by 680
to 347, with 136 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks put on 2.66 at 1,353.60 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 1.15 to 1,081.14.
Activity was led by individual speculators and dealers, while most
institutional investors remained on the sidelines. Traders said some US
pension funds were looking to increase their weightings in Japanese shares,
but that European investors, who have foreign exchange profits on their
holdings, were reducing their allocations.
Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said share prices could ease
during the second quarter of this year, and that there was little need for
hasty buy decisions. 'The market will correct after the fiscal year-end,
with 16,000 at the lowest end of the range,' he added.
Short term trading centred around companies related to Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, and the Japan Rail Group. NTT took a breather, retreating Y7,000
to Y803,000 on profit-taking. Iwatsu Electric, which has close business ties
with NTT, was the day's most active issue, forging ahead Y43 to Y538.
Nippon Express appreciated Y6 to Y825. The company is considered a
JR-related stock, due to its land holdings around JR railway stations.
Nabco, a Kobe Steel affiliate which makes automobile and railway brakes,
climbed Y80 to Y570 on a report that it had developed a new air-brake system
with JR researchers.
High-technology shares were lower on profit-taking by individual investors.
Hitachi dipped Y4 to Y753, Toshiba Y12 to Y606 and NEC Y12 to Y767.
Kyowa Hakko Kogyo surged by its daily limit of Y101 to Y1,100 on reports of
its development of an anti-cancer agent.
In Osaka, the OSE average was up 156.35 to 19,076.15 in volume of 45m
shares. The index rose above the 19,000 mark for the first time since
December 25 last year.
Roundup
EVENTS OF the weekend, and last week, had a powerful impact in the region.
HONG KONG dropped a further 5.1 per cent on China's angry reaction to
Governor Chris Patten's decision to proceed with democratic reform. The Hang
Seng index finished at 5,854.61, down 315.79 but up from a day's low of
5,792.18. However, London over-the-counter trading was more positive,
indicating an improvement in the index of about 100 points.
Turnover stayed high, totalling HKDollars 5.23bn, although down from
Friday's HKDollars 5.32bn. HSBC finished HKDollars 1.50 down at HKDollars
64.50. After the market closed, the group reported a 68 per cent jump in
1992 net profits, but shares in its Hang Seng Bank unit lost HKDollars 3.50
to HKDollars 62.50. HSBC closed later in London HKDollars 1.80 better at
HKDollars 66.30.
AUSTRALIA subsided on Labor's election win and falls on overseas markets,
the All Ordinaries index ending 35.1 off at 1,626.4 after a day's low of
1,614.0. Labor's promise of a reduction in company tax and indications that
it will cut interest rates helped to mollify investors.
Bank shares were sold as hopes of mergers were dashed by the coalition's
election loss. ANZ fell 32 cents to ADollars 3.26, Westpac 11 cents to
ADollars 3.09 and NAB 8 cents to ADollars 8.47.
Among retailers, Coles dropped 15 cents to ADollars 4.55 and Foodland
receded 15 cents to ADollars 6.75. Investors had hoped that a coalition
government would benefit retailers by scrapping payroll tax and exempting
food from its goods and services tax.
NEW ZEALAND shed 1.4 per cent on Labor's surprise win in Australia, the
NZSE-40 index closing at 1,567.04, down 21.58.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index, hurt by Hong Kong and poorer
than expected results posted by Singapore's key DBS Bank, slipped 22.07 to
1,630.81. MANILA lost 1.5 per cent in reaction to a PLDT slide on Wall
Street, the composite index ending 23.03 lower at 1,471.65. PLDT fell
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 3/8 in New York on Friday.
SEOUL rose for the third straight session, the composite index closing 10.89
higher at 645.73 on renewed hopes that the government may set aside an
announcement which would phase out widespread clandestine trading. TAIWAN
put on 2.1 per cent in thin trading, the weighted index ending 93.16 better
at 4,507.00.
BOMBAY resumed trading for one hour after last Friday's bomb blast caused
extensive damage to the stock exchange building. The BSE index finished at
2,416.28, a rise of 86.19 from Thursday's close.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar struggles to advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGREEMENT ON Germany's Solidarity Pact yesterday strengthened expectations
on the foreign exchange markets for a cut in the Bundesbank's official
lending rates, writes Emma Tucker.
Hopes that the German central bank will announce a  1/2 percentage-point
reduction in the discount rate on Thursday were buoyed by reports that
Germany's political parties, federal states, employers and trade unions had
agreed on a public financing package to underpin the east German economy.
Initially the US dollar was the chief beneficiary of the news, although by
the end of European trading it had failed to break through Friday's close of
DM1.6655.
Analysts are somewhat bemused as to why the dollar remains trapped in such a
narrow trading range after good non-farm payroll figures of a week ago,
political unrest in the former Soviet Union and strong prospects for a
German rate cut should have combined to give the currency a strong upward
boost.
Mr Christian Dunis of Chemical Bank in London said: 'I think the markets are
getting a bit impatient with the inability of the dollar to move higher, but
at the same time no-one has the guts to push it too far down because the
expectation is still that it will rally.'
Mr Dunis pointed out that the difference between US and German lending rates
remains significant as the market waits to see what the Bundesbank will do
later this week. The dollar made no gains on the day, ending easier at
DM1.6615, and in New York at DM1.6623.
The pound did not respond to the growing prospects of German monetary
easing, continuing to trade in a very narrow range ahead of today's Budget.
Although a cut in German rates would make it easier for the UK authorities
to reduce interest rates, the Bank of England and the Treasury have been
discouraging expectations of further monetary easing.
Official resolve will have been strengthened by yesterday's news that
manufacturing output rose a better than expected 0.8 per cent in January.
The figure added to evidence that a modest economic recovery is taking place
in the UK. The pound lost  1/2 pfennig to close at DM2.3825. Against the
dollar it ended barely changed at Dollars 1.4345.
Tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism were held at bay. The
escudo, which came under pressure at the end of last week following reported
differences between the central bank and the government, regained stability.
In later trade it eased to just above Es93 per D-Mark. The peseta was also
slightly weaker, closing at Pta71.41. The French franc was virtually
unchanged at FFr3.401.
Potential for strains within the system remain, however, and dealers
yesterday warned that failure by the Bundesbank to act on Thursday could put
the mechanism's weaker currencies under pressure.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARCH short sterling futures contract dipped around five basis points
yesterday, as dealers all but abandoned hopes for a Budget interest rate cut
today.
Weekend newspaper reports that tax increases in the Budget were likely to be
modest, and stronger than expected manufacturing output figures yesterday,
reduced already waning expectations.
Some dealers thought that a fiscally tight Budget would be accompanied by
another full percentage point cut in interest rates. However, reports
suggest that the chancellor is set to increase the overall tax burden by as
little as Pounds 2bn.
A 0.8 per cent rise in manufacturing output in January, compared with the
previous month, added to the feeling that pressure on the government to ease
monetary policy was lifting. The month-on-month increase compared with
expectations for a 0.1 per cent rise and added to evidence that the economy
is at a turning point.
The March contract, which opened at 94.12, moved as low as 94.06 during the
day and closed at around 94.08.
Contracts further out also fell. The June contract dropped 7 basis points
from the opening to end at 94.57 in late trading.
On the money markets, short dated cash rates were squeezed higher by a large
forecast liquidity shortage which the Bank of England had difficulty
relieving.
By midday the Bank had removed only Pounds 353m of a Pounds 1.4bn shortage
and overnight rates crept as high as 13 per cent. The Bank made better
progress in the afternoon, purchasing bills totalling Pounds 1.03bn and
providing late assistance of Pounds 20m.
Overnight rates drifted to just below 8 per cent, while the three-month
interbank rate finished unchanged at around 5 15/16 per cent.
In continental European futures trading, dealers reported that agreement on
the Solidarity Pact in Germany had improved the underlying tone of the
market, even if some doubts about a Bundes-bank easing on Thursday still
existed.
'There are still sufficient underlying tensions in the European exchange
rate mech-anism to prompt a sell-off in the Continental markets if the
Bundesbank decides not to do anything,' warned one. The market has priced in
a half-point cut in the discount rate. A full one point cut would prompt a
significant rally.

FRENCH FISHERMEN and potato farmers yesterday stepped up pressure on
France's beleaguered socialist government, now only ten days away from
parliamentary elections, with fresh outbreaks of unrest throughout the
country.
A 'commando raid' of Etaples fishermen caused between FFr4m and FFr5m
(Pounds 490,000-Pounds 600,000) of damage in a dawn raid on a fish warehouse
at Boulogne-sur-Mer. They set fire to cargoes of imported fish outside the
warehouse, then ransacked trailers of fish from Denmark and Ireland.
The mood of France's fishing ports has become increasingly heated in recent
weeks as fishermen have escalated their protests against imports of cheap
fish. Fishermen's leaders have vowed to continue the dispute until
Thursday's meeting of European Community fishing ministers in Brussels.
However, one group of Breton fishermen today plans to stage a 'humanitarian
and pacifist' protest by delivering six tonnes of fish to a food bank
outside Paris to be distributed to the needy through the Salvation Army and
other voluntary organisations.
Meanwhile potato farmers continued their battle against EC agricultural
reform by staging a tractor demonstration at Quimper yesterday morning
during which they blocked the streets with 400 tonnes of potatoes. This
followed similar protests in other towns last week.
The government also faces problems at the docks. Some of the largest French
trading ports yesterday came to a standstill as dock workers responded to
calls for a 24-hour national strike in protest at modernisation plans.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian cocoa thrives as
prices languish - One big producer is still increasing its output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD cocoa industry is in a state of crisis, with prices at record lows
in real terms. But consumers and producers continue to bicker about a new
International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) withholding scheme to support the
market.
Bucking the trend, however, is Indonesia, which remains remarkably bullish
about cocoa's prospects. While output from major producers such as Brazil
and Malaysia is in decline, the archipelago's output is rising inexorably.
In 1980-81, the country produced just 16,000 tonnes of speciality 'fine'
cocoa, which by 1983-84 had picked up to 32,000 tonnes and by 1987-88 to
65,000 tonnes as farmers began to plant 'bulk' cocoa trees.
Production doubled again by 1990-91 and the current crop year, ending
September 30, is forecast at 220,000 tonnes (of which 15,000 tonnes will be
fine cocoa) making Indonesia the world's fourth largest producer - behind
the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Brazil. Nor has Indonesia's cocoa-boom begun to
subside. Traders confidently expect production to exceed 400,000 tonnes a
year by the end of the decade, taking Indonesia into second place.
Mr Ibrahim Hasan, chief executive of the Indonesian Cocoa Association (Inca)
says the roots of the boom go back to the 1970s when high prices led to
interest among smallholder farmers.
Many of the plantation workers in Malaysia's cocoa-producing state of Sabah
were Indonesians who smuggled seedlings back when returning home. In
addition, the government and private agricultural companies set up seedling
nurseries.
This led to a dramatic change in the country's production base. In the
1970s, cocoa production was split between state plantations (90 per cent)
and private plantations (10 per cent). State plantations now account for
only 25 per cent of the crop, while private plantations provide 15 per cent
and smallholder farmers 60 per cent.
High productivity has allowed cocoa to be remunerative for farmers, despite
the collapse of international prices. Mr Hasan estimates the yield in
Sulawesi, the centre for smallholder production, at about 1.5 tonnes a
hectare, five times the level of some West African producing countries. He
estimates the yield in north Sumatra at slightly below 1 tonne a hectare.
'Indonesians are a force in cocoa. They're not on the peripheries, which
even two years ago they were,' explains one London cocoa trader. Other
producers and the ICCO, however, have been slow to pick up on Indonesia's
sudden importance.
As Mr Hasan observes: 'If you look at all the ICCO documents, Indonesia is
still classified as a 100 per cent fine cocoa producer'. One reason for the
ICCO's failure to update records may be that Indonesia has yet to join the
organisation, a fact that has significant implications for any future ICCO
price support scheme.
'Indonesia is the lowest cost producer and if it's not willing to
participate in any withholding scheme, it is that much more difficult to
work,' one cocoa broker points out.
Brokers estimate a withholding scheme must encompass 80-85 per cent of world
production to have any chance of supporting prices. Indonesia already
accounts for 10 per cent of world production and is likely to have a 15 per
cent share by the end of the decade.
Indonesian producers, however, are reluctant to join the ICCO, for as one
official explains: 'We are very worried that if we become a member our
production programme may be constrained by outside factors'.
Indonesian producers are confident that cocoa prices will pick up with or
without an ICCO scheme in place as the industry enters a period in which
world demand exceeds annual output. They are, therefore, more concerned with
structuring the domestic industry to take advantage of higher demand than
with the need for international co-operation.
The main thrust of the next five years will be to improve quality, say Inca
officials. Indonesian beans have a relatively low fat content and farmers
tend to ferment their crop inadequately. As a result, Indonesian cocoa sells
at a discount to the world market price.
'We have to be really concerned about quality if we are to fulfil the demand
of industry,' warns Mr Hakim Warsono, Inca's deputy chairman. The task may
not be easy - that Inca has yet to get its own offices is a reminder
Indonesia's cocoa industry is still in its infancy.
Inca officials, however, are brimming with confidence. In instances when
farmers have mimicked West African fermentation and sun-drying techniques
Indonesian beans 'get almost a Ghana-style taste profile' and can compete
among the world's best, says Mr Hasan.

<TEXT>
CHICAGO WHEAT prices rallied yesterday in response to Friday evening's
announcement that the US Department of Agriculture would ship 520,000 tonnes
of wheat and 87,000 tonnes of rice to Russia by July under a food aid
programme.
The USDA will have to buy the grain from the open market as government
stockpiles have been depleted.
Commercial grain shipments have been at a standstill since November, when
Russia began to miss interest payments on its US-backed grain loans.
At midsession yesterday old-crop wheat futures prices were up 6 cents per
bushel, with wheat for May delivery trading at 329. Prices for delivery
later in the summer, during harvest, also rallied, but the advance was
smaller.
Analysts said winter wheat plantings in Kansas and the Western plains states
were in excellent condition, creating the potential for record yields.
The US wheat donations to Russia had been expected, according to Mr Daniel
Basse, a grains analyst for AgResource, However, the quantity was larger
than projections. Mr Basse said that while Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's
president, encountered political setbacks over the weekend, grain traders
viewed his dispute with parliamentary hardliners as part of the normal
legislative process. 'Mr Yeltsin is still president,' Mr Basse said, 'they
didn't ask him to resign'.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nestle seeks direct milk supply
from UK farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, THE UK subsidiary of the Swiss food group, yesterday offered
contracts to 8,000 dairy farmers near its factories for direct supplies of
milk when the Milk Marketing Board statutory monopoly ends some time next
year.
The move follows the announcement last month by Northern Foods of plans to
set up the Northern Milk Partnership, a co-operative venture which hopes to
recruit more than 5,000 farmers to supply the company with up to 2bn litres
of milk a year worth Pounds 500m.
Nestle, which buys nearly 5 per cent of UK milk, aims to attract enough
farmers to supply 700m litres a year, worth about Pounds 150m, to factories
in Ashbourne, Derbyshire; Girvan, Ayrshire; Dalston, Cumbria; and Omagh, Co
Tyrone.
The contracts would not require regular renewal, but would guarantee
producers a market for three years ahead, while allowing them to sell
elsewhere without penalty by giving three months notice.
The Milk Marketing Board, which is reforming itself into a co-operative to
be known as Milk Marque, yesterday urged dairy farmers to sign nothing, but
to keep their options open. Milk Marque hopes to supply 80 per cent of the
UK's Pounds 3bn annual milk market, a share some observers believe it will
need to cover costs.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar storms to three-year
highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD SUGAR prices, already moving ahead on successive reductions in the
Thai crop estimate, surged to the highest level for nearly three years
yesterday on news that the storms sweeping up the eastern seaboard of the US
had hit Cuba.
In New York the May raw sugar contract was up 0.95 at 11.50 cents a lb in
late trading, having touched a peak of 11.83 cents earlier. In London the
August white sugar contract closed at Dollars 297.50 a tonne, up Dollars 13
on the day.
However, analysts in London were cautious over the damage to Cuba's crop,
which was already expected to be well down on last year's 7m tonnes. Some
are talking of 5m tonnes and under, but there is no hard evidence on which
to base a judgment.
Talk of damage to sugar mills and dock facilities in Cuba added further fuel
to the flames. 'The Cubans have a vested interest in allowing people to
think it's terrible, ' said Mr Chris Pack, analyst at Czarnikow. 'But it
can't have done any good to have a tremendous storm at the start of the
season.'
Last week the Thai government revised its production estimate down to 3.51m
tonnes - the lowest level for five years. At the beginning of the season
production was expected to reach a record 5m tonnes, but drought has damaged
the crop.

Exchange yesterday. The three months delivery price added Dollars 65 to the

early in the day of Chinese selling. The COPPER market was in retreat
following last week's rally and the three months price closed Pounds 11.75
lower at Pounds 1,534.50 a tonne. Dealers said the New York-inspired rise
ran out of steam as the market's high stocks and poor demand growth rates
outside North America reasserted themselves. Japanese selling started the
downturn, they added, and as buyers backed off the market became thin. The
GOLD price moved slightly higher in late afternoon as the market continued
to watch Russia for signs of a developing political crisis. At the London
bullion market close the price was 90 cents up from Friday at Dollars 328.65
a troy ounce. PLATINUM was also assisted by the Russian situation and the
London price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 325.25 an ounce, up
Dollars 1.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (7): A world
built on silicon - Paul Taylor keeps abreast of the bewildering changes in
technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past decade the electronics revolution has reached almost all
industries enabling the development of a wide range of new consumer and
business products and services.
The personal computer, fax machines, satellite television, mobile telephony,
medical scanners, compact-disc players, anti-lock brakes and engine
management systems for cars are among the many products which have been made
possible by recent advances in semiconductor technology.
Even more sophisticated applications will soon emerge, including personal
communicators, video-telephones, crash avoidance systems and car navigation
aids. The pace of change is accelerating and silicon technology will
continue to be the engine of change and innovation.
Higher-speed devices will be integrated and packed closer, in smaller, more
complex and reliable packages which cost less. But to turn these basic
building blocks into useful products requires very expensive specialist
machinery, expert knowledge and the application of the latest computerised
techniques.
Many large companies whose core business is not primarily electronics will
lack state-of-the-art equipment and expertise to take advantage of these
changes.
Others will focus on design and marketing rather than manufacture. In either
case the opportunities for the specialist contract electronics manufacturer
are substantial.
Perhaps more than any other single factor the growth of contract electronics
manufacturing has been fuelled by advances in technology - and by the switch
to SMT (surface mount technology) in particular.
From the late 1950s, when transistors and printed circuit boards (PCBs)
replaced valves, until the mid-1980s almost all PCBs were assembled using
conventional PIH/PTH (pin-in-hole or plated-through-hole) technology.
Individual components are inserted either by hand or automatically into
plated holes in the circuit board and molten solder is then forced up
through the hole using a 'wave' solder machine. When the solder dries it
attaches each component to the circuitry on the board.
However, since the mid 1980s, SMT has become increasingly popular. In SMT
solder paste - a putty-like mixture of minute solder balls mixed with flux -
is screen printed on to circuit terminals or pads on the circuit board. The
ICs (integrated circuits) and other miniature components are placed, or
'onsetted', on to the solder paste using highly accurate automatic placement
equipment. The solder paste is then melted or 'reflowed' which creates the
joint between the component and the circuit board.
SMT has some significant advantages over the traditional method. These
include smaller size, increased automation, lower production costs, better
performance and higher reliability. However there are also some
disadvantages.
In particular, SMT 'pick and place' equipment must be very accurate,
requires skilled programming and is costly. A typical automated high volume
SMT line costs around Pounds 1m, a significant barrier to entry in the
contract manufacturing business and an incentive for OEMs to subcontract
their electronics manufacturing.
Mr Derek Duffett, director of the Association of Contract electronics
Manufacturers (ACeM), recently noted that the advent of SMT had raised the
investment level needed to enter the business and was one of the major
reasons for the trend towards contract electronics manufacturing.
According to figures from Motorola, the US electronics group, two years ago
70 per cent of the world consumption of integrated circuits was for PTH
components. About 20 per cent was of SMT components with the remaining 10
per cent shared by other emerging technologies.
Reflecting the fact that contract electronics manufacturers tend to be at
the leading edge of technology, many in the UK already report that SMT
output has overtaken traditional PTH, although a lot of boards are hybrids -
combining both technologies.
The switch to SMT has often been overstated, but most industry participants
believe that by 1995 about half of all components sold will be of the SMT
variety, and that by the end of the decade SMT will have emerged as the
clearly dominant technology.
Nevertheless by then other new technologies which have been in the
development stage for many years will have also reached the market. They are
needed because the performance and density requirements of electronics
systems will begin to exceed the capabilities of discrete chip packaging,
like SMT. To overcome this will require new 'interconnection techniques'.
The latest new technique, which is already being used in the electronics
industry in Japan, the US and occasionally in the UK, is called TAB (tape
automated bonding). In this method a lead frame is attached to 'bumps' on
the edge of the silicon chip in a process known as 'inner lead bonding'.
The chip and its leads are then sealed or encapsulated in a glue-like
substance called 'glob-top' and mounted on a reel, similar to a 35mm camera
film. These tiny devices can also be placed on to little trays called 'slide
carriers'. The components are then attached to a circuit board using
thermo-sonic means or conventional reflow soldering.
Another packaging method called COB (chip on board) is very similar to TAB
but no lead frame is used. Instead the tiny silicon chip is placed directly
on to the circuit board or 'substrate' and then attached using a special
'die attach' glue. Individual wires are then bonded to terminals on the chip
and connected to the pads on the substrate. The whole assembly is then
encapsulated in glob-top.
Both TAB and COB provide greatly improved electrical performance than
earlier technologies and allow increased component packing densities on the
board - leading either to smaller boards or greater functionality. By the
end of the decade they are expected to account for up to one fifth of all
component sales.
The latest packaging technology is called MCM (multi chip module). An MCM is
made up of several bare silicon chips mounted on the substrate. Then, using
COB techniques, the chips or 'die' are connected to circuitry much smaller
and more carefully routed than those on PCBs. These MCMs provide much higher
performance than the same chips mounted conventionally on a circuit board.
In addition to these changing methods of assembly, the printed circuit board
itself is also changing. Already TFT (thick-film technology), flexible
circuits and three-dimensional substrates have emerged as means to further
increase component density.
Using these new technologies requires even more complex factory
infrastructure and sophisticated handling techniques. Optical recognition
and correction systems on the machines which place the components become
more necessary as the space between leads (the pitch) becomes narrower.
At the same time this places even more stringent demands on manufacturers'
processes and quality improvement programmes such as zero defect and
statistical process control (SPC), both advanced quality manufacturing
techniques increasingly required by customers. This in turn means most
manufacturers invest very heavily in sophisticated automatic testing
equipment.
In order to achieve the greatest efficiency and flexibility with their
equipment many contract manufacturers have installed electronic data
exchange (EDI) and computer management systems which often tie into those of
their customers and suppliers.
Meanwhile, in order to keep up with the advances in silicon technology
manufacturers must update and replace their equipment frequently. This means
there is often little time to recover capital costs and considerable
pressure to keep the machinery working 24 hours a day. But although speed is
an important factor in choosing equipment, manufacturers also stress the
need for reliability, capability and flexibility.
Finally, although electronics generally has a good environmental record,
electronics manufacturers, including those in the contract industry, are
having to focus on environmental issues. For example the use of
chloro-fluorocarbons (CFCs) in the cleaning stage of SMT board assembly is
being phased out.

probably the most northerly outpost of Scotland's contract electronics
manufacturing industry. Allgood Technology, at Foyers near Inverness, uses
surface mount technology to produce high value populated printed circuit
boards (PCBs) in low volumes.
It was founded three years ago by Mr Peter Allgood, a digital engineer who
took voluntary redundancy from BT at the age of 30 and moved to the
Highlands from Birmingham in search of a better quality of life. The company
now has turnover of Pounds 120,000 and is producing boards for products such
as professional audio equipment.
Allgood Technology is at one end of the spectrum of the Scottish electronics
industry, which employs 45,000 people, and which in 1991 accounted for 13
per cent of Scotland's employment in manufacturing and 21 per cent of its
manufactured output.
The Scottish electronics industry is dominated by multinationals. It has
original equipment manufacturers such as International Business Machines,
employing 2,200 people making personal computers at Greenock, and Motorola,
which produces both semiconductors and mobile telephone equipment at plants
in East Kilbride and Easter Inch.
But there is also a large components sector, in which multinationals play
the major role. In contract electronic manufacturing (CEM), Scotland has
several of the largest operators in the UK - offshoots of Avex, SCI and
Philips - and a number of smaller specialist producers. At the less
sophisticated end of the electronics industry there are substantial
businesses employing many people in assembly and manufacturing.
It is a frequent source of complaint in Scotland that indigenous
Scottish-based companies account for a very small part of the industry -
only about three per cent in terms of employment - and, according to a 1991
survey by Dr Ivan Turok of Strathclyde university, provide only 12 per cent
of material inputs by value. This ignores the fact that most electronics
plants in Scotland see themselves as part of a global or EC-wide industry.
Avex, for example, at East Kilbride, works for eight of the world's largest
electronics companies (though like most CEM companies it refuses to name
them), supplying their plants in Scotland, the EC and the US. It employs
about 1,000 people and can design components to order, as well as
manufacturing populated PCBs and assemble them into such things as
telephones, personal computers and complex medical equipment.
In Dunfermline, Philips Circuit Assembly, part of the Dutch multinational,
has a large plant producing populated PCBs for OEMs. About 50 per cent of
its output goes to OEM plants in Scotland and about 35 per cent is exported.
Mr Cliff Hargess, sales and marketing manager, says it has an advantage over
other CEM companies because its surface mount technology line can work to
'extra fine pitch,' with the space between components being as little as
15,000th of an inch. Philips employs 600 people.
The other major CEM company in Scotland is SCI which has a plant at Irvine
which employs about 800 people, increased by taking on several hundred
temporary workers at busy times. (SCI is dealt with in more detail in the
article below.) Another multinational CEM company is Timex Electronics in
Dundee, currently rebuilding its workforce after dismissing all its 300
production workers after they refused a new pay and conditions package.
But multinationals are not the only key players in the Scottish CEM sector.
A significant player is Keltek, part of the UK quoted Graseby group, which
is based at Kelso in the Borders. It has been operating for 20 years and
occupies a specialised niche in the market.
'We offer a complete service from concept design to turnkey delivery for
OEMs,' says Mr Bob Wardlaw, marketing director. Keltek does CEM work for
companies such as BT, Post Office Counters, BOC, Smiths Industries and
British Gas. It has annual sales of about Pounds 13m and employs 200 people.
Ms Carol Brannigan of Avex, who plays a leading role in the Association of
Contract Electronics Manufacturers (ACeM), argues that Scotland's Silicon
Glen, as it is called, has a strong infrastructure of suppliers and human
skills. But she would like to see more component manufacturers come to widen
the range of products available at short notice.
The picture of the Scottish electronics industry which emerges is one of
close cooperation between OEMs and CEMs as well as component suppliers, many
of which are only a handful of miles apart.
Avex works closely with Prestwick Holdings, a quoted Scottish manufacturer
of raw PCBs. Another important indigenous Scottish company in this field is
Exacta at Selkirk.
The trend is for OEMs to subcontract increasing quantities of their work in
order to hold down their own overheads and let other companies bear the
strain of ramping up and then perhaps running down their labour forces in
response to demand. However, there are also signs that OEMs are beginning to
use their facilities to do CEM work for others.
Digital, which makes PCs at Ayr, recently began assembling and testing
microchips there for test houses and for other manufacturers. In addition it
will be using its recently installed Pounds 1.7m surface mount technology
line to assemble modules for other manufacturers. Its subcontract work to
date has so far been worth about Pounds 1m.
At the less sophisticated end of production, Scottish-based companies do
considerable business in assembling personal computers and other PC
components. Mimtec, an electronics manufacturer owned by Murray
International Holdings, which is 88 per cent owned by Mr David Murray, one
of Scotland's leading entrepreneurs, has for several years been assembling
PCs for Scottish-based OEMs such as IBM and Compaq.
Now, to meet the big increase in demand for IBM's PCs since it introduced a
new range of products and slashed its prices, Mimtec is expected to build a
large, 400,000 square foot plant at Gourock, close to IBM's Greenock
facility, for PC assembly, with IBM likely to be involved in financing the
Pounds 13m project.
In an unusual development the ranks of companies assembling PCs for IBM have
been joined by the transport group LEP International, which has for some
time handled much of Greenock's distribution and has now started operating a
PC assembly line.
Another important player in the Scottish electronics industry is Fullarton
Fabrications, a subsidiary of the UK's Laird Group, which employs about
1,400 people in a network of plants at Irvine. Fullarton does sheetmetal
work (building boxes for PCs and other computers) and assembles keyboards
and other components, some of which are exported to Ireland, Brazil and the
US.

from outer space - Profile of SCI of Huntsville, Alabama

ONE of the fruits of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(Nasa) programme in the 1960s was that it spawned a new generation of
innovative electronics companies.
One is SCI, founded in Alabama by Olin B King, a former Nasa engineer who
began a three-man business manufacturing flight simulators for the moon
shots in his basement in 1961.
King realised, however, that there was not much volume in 18 moon shots. So
he diversified the company, initially called Space Craft Inc., into building
a wide range of electronic systems under contract.
By 1969, when the Apollo launch vehicle left the Kennedy Space centre launch
pad, it was carrying more than 400 SCI-built sub-systems providing vital
instrumentation, communication and computer functions, including some in the
lunar lander.
Eight years later, in August 1977, SCI built the plated-wire memories for
the highly successful Voyager 2 spacecraft whose systems were still
operating flawlessly more than a decade later.
When the original IBM PC made its appearance in 1981 it came with a
SCI-manufactured motherboard. SCI also manufactured the Sinclair-designed
Z88 computer.
By the mid 1980s SCI had become a Fortune 500 company in its own right.
Today it is one of the biggest and oldest contract electronics manufacturers
employing about 9,500 people in 19 manufacturing plants worldwide, and
serving mainly multinational customers in North America, Western Europe and
South East Asia where it has plants in Singapore and Thailand. Last year,
the publicly-quoted group, which is still based at Huntsville, reported net
income of Dollars 3.83m on revenues of Dollars 1.05bn despite the recession.
SCI's major worldwide IT customers in the year to June 30 last year included
IBM, Seagate Technology and Conner Peripherals, which together accounted for
almost half its total revenues. However, SCI is now a major diversified
manufacturer for both the Government and commercial markets. It designs,
manufactures, markets and services electronic products for OEM (original
equipment manufacturers) customers in many industries including the
aerospace, telecommunications, medical and banking sectors.
Its investment in electronics manufacturing technology is enormous. Overall
the group, which began to install surface mount technology (SMT) production
lines in 1985, had 75 fully automated SMT assembly lines in operation by mid
1992 together with 34 traditional lines using the older PTH
(plated-through-hole) technology.
The group is divided into five geographic regions each with multiple plants
manufacturing components, sub-assemblies and finished products for
customers, but also increasingly offering a full 'turnkey' option including
design, engineering, purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and support
services if required.
The growth of SCI's international operations, including those in Europe,
directly reflects the increasing globalisation of the world electronics
industry. SCI followed its OEM customers overseas in order to maintain its
global manufacturing relationships.
For example, SCI's European region comprises two manufacturing facilities,
one in Irvine, Scotland, and the other in Fermoy, County Cork,in the Irish
Republic.
Both sites reflect the establishment of significant offshore manufacturing
bases by global OEMs over the past decade. In Scotland, SCI followed
customers such as IBM, Sun Micro systems and Mitsubishi which needed to
establish operations in Europe and were attracted to the region by a range
of incentives.
Similarly the Fermoy plant, which employs 300 people, was set up in 1989 to
provide electronic assemblies to Irish manufacturing operations of
multinational OEMs such as Dell Computer which set up operations in Ireland
as part of their global manufacturing strategies.
'They all want to manufacture close to the market because it gives
flexibility,' says Mr Bruce Armstrong, SCI senior vice president in charge
of the European division.
SCI's size and dispersed operations are a significant advantage when dealing
with large multinational OEMs because it can offer customers considerable
flexibility. If a customer's market or manufacturing need changes by
location or demand, production can be switched to any SCI plant in a matter
of days.
For example, a complete new SMT line can be flown in from Huntsville and,
says Armstrong, 'be up and running within two weeks'. Because modern
contract manufacturing is capital intensive the cost differential between
different regions is not usually significant. 'These days the cost is a
given, but it is flexibility that counts,' when it comes to holding on to
customers, he says.
Nevertheless he accepts that the European plants have to be able to match
the Far East on the basis of 'landed' or total contract price - including
those costs which are often overlooked such as transport, inventory and
other less tangible items such as delays and inflexibility.
It is a measure of the success at Irvine in controlling overheads and other
costs while providing flexibility that it has recently succeeded in winning
some contracts back from the Far East.
The 120,000 sq ft Scottish plant was set up in 1984, mainly to supply IBM's
Greenock PC operations. Today it employs about 800 people although, like
most other large contract electronics manufacturers, SCI also uses a pool of
casual labour and the workforce is expanded by several hundred temporary
workers at busy times.
Equipment at Irvine includes 12 Fuji SMT lines, each costing about Dollars
1m, four Universal PTH lines and three system configuration lines. Currently
80 per cent of output is SMT, 15 per cent PTH and 5 per cent even newer
technologies such as COB (chip on board). But by the turn of the century Mr
Armstrong expects the proportions to be 75 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per
cent respectively.
The product mix is also changing. Five years ago 90 per cent of production
was for the IT industry. However the plant has broadened its customer base.
IT now represents about 70 per cent, telecommunications 20 per cent and
automotive 10 per cent with telecoms and the automotive sectors growing
rapidly.
SCI has also expanded its range of services and increasingly sees itself as
being in a beneficial partnership with its customers. Some customers still
only require a consignment manufacturing service - they supply all the
materials. However, Mr Armstrong says the 'more enlightened' OEMs have long
since moved towards much broader 'turnkey' contracts where services can
range from product engineering and design for manufacturing, through
procurement, manufacturing and testing to distribution.
SCI designs and manufactures some products completely. For example, it
designs and builds its own PCs, which are then badged by two big computer
companies. Mr Armstrong acknowledges that there is some temptation for SCI
to widen its business and sell products under its own name. However, he
adds, 'in the end it's about doing what you are good at'. And for SCI that
is being expert at capital intensive, high technology, flexible contract
manufacturing.
In order to maximise flexibility while minimising costs SCI uses automated
manufacturing systems and electronic data interchange (EDI) to provide
sophisticated links with its customers and suppliers and to interconnect its
own plants.
'The reason we are efficient is that each plant is a profit and loss centre.
They have to make a profit,' says Mr Armstrong. The two European plants
export 50 per cent of their production to continental Europe, and the
percentage is rising so SCI is likely to build a new plant in Europe soon,
probably in France.
When any of its plants reaches full capacity SCI builds another rather than
expanding existing facilities. This is because it believes that overheads
increase quickly when a plant becomes too large. 'Otherwise you become an
OEM,' says Mr Armstrong. 'In our business small and medium is beautiful.'

FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (4): Partnership
in an age of technical complexity - Ever more work is being farmed out

THE use of contract manufacturers in the West grew rapidly over the past
decade as managements reassessed their corporate strategies.
As a result many companies decided to concentrate on their core activities
and turn other functions, including manufacturing, over to specialist
contractors.
This reassessment was often prompted by the need to remain competitive in an
increasingly global marketplace. It also highlighted other concepts such as
total quality management and just-in-time inventory control which contribute
to the success of Japanese companies.
Contracting out of manufacturing and assembly is well established in Japan.
Recent research at Tokyo University suggests that it now accounts for over a
third of Japanese companies' total manufacturing costs and will increase to
over 40 per cent by the end of the decade. In the 1960s it was less than 20
per cent.
Most Japanese companies farm out manufacturing in the belief that
specialists can offer better quality and efficiency. It may also help them
to cut costs, scale down capital spending and concentrate on what they are
really good at - market research, product definition, product planning,
marketing and sales.
According to a survey by MHM, a market research organisation based in Ayr,
Scotland, about 35 per cent of European contract electronics customers had
no electronics assembly operations of their own.
There are many reasons why manufacturers use contract manufacturers and cost
is not always the principal one. Some studies in the US suggest that
managements who use sub-contractors principally to cut overheads and jobs
end up regretting the decision.
Most management consultants argue that contract manufacturing should form
part of an overall strategy to improve quality and competitiveness by
delivering the right products to market at the right time and the right
price.
The basis of total quality theory is to identify, and be responsive to, the
customer, produce a top quality product first time, and work to improve
quality all the time. A partnership with a contract manufacturer can help
achieve these aims.
In any case, within the electronics industry the days are gone when OEMs can
do everything themselves in order to retain most of the added value. Already
most components are bought in and, since they are now so complex, the bulk
of the cost of an assembled printed circuit board (PCB) lies in the
components it carries.
As competition in the global electronics industry has grown the competent
handling of these components, some of which may cost hundreds of pounds, has
become crucial if a company is to maintain its profit margins.
'The diversification of disciplines and expertise in modern electronics is
driving companies to reassess their core function and raison d'etre for
being in the business,' says Mr Derek Duffett, director of the Association
of Contract Electronics manufacturers (ACeM).
'The 80:20 rule applies to many aspects of business, be it range of
products, or range of activities; in other words only 20 per cent of
products or activities produce 80 per cent of the profit,' he adds.
Today companies, particularly large multinationals, are increasingly aware
of the significance of both direct and indirect costs. Contracting out
manufacturing frees capital to invest in core activities and enables the
management to concentrate on key areas which will help to maintain a
competitive edge.
In addition the advent of capital intensive processes such as surface mount
technology (SMT) has encouraged many OEMs, particularly those outside the
electronics industry, to leave such specialist activity to contract
electronics manufacturers.
Electronic controls are replacing older electro-mechanical controls in many
areas including automotive design, medical systems and a wide range of
consumer goods such as washing machines. However many manufacturers cannot
justify the cost of SMT or other automated manufacturing equipment which
would stand idle much of the time.
Similarly the use of a contract manufacturer can remove the need to recruit
and train expensive specialist staff. The contract manufacturer's employees
represent a pool of dedicated technical and production expertise which is
available to the customer. Indeed most contract manufacturers now offer a
full range of services to their clients including, if required, PCB design,
layout, manufacture and testing.
However greater flexibility and speed of response are probably the most
important advantage of using contract electronics manufacturers. Most
contract manufacturers have the capacity and flexible workforce to start
production very quickly to meet an unexpected surge in demand.
A striking characteristic of today's electronics and computer markets is the
shortening of product life cycles - in some parts of the computer industry
they have shrunk to as little as six months and OEMs need to move quickly
from one product and technology to the next.
Contract manufacturing can help to ensure this fast response and lessen the
risk associated with manufacturing and holding inventory.
Contractors can also work with a customer to reduce costs during a product
life cycle. Other potential advantages include economies of scale in
component purchasing and the use of sophisticated computerised automated
manufacturing and test sys tems to improve quality and provide
'just-in-time' deliveries. Most contract manufacturers have embraced total
quality programmes, and obtained certification.
Sometimes there are significant cost advantages to using a contract
electronics manufacturer. However, cost comparisons need to be approached
carefully. Often the true costs of in-house manufacturing operations are
obscured, for example by shared corporate functions. In addition,
comparisons between CEMs in different parts of the world can be confusing.
On the basis of labour costs alone contract electronics manufacturers in the
Far East continue to have an advantage over their counterparts in Europe and
North America. However the gap is narrowing and the use of increasingly
automated equipment means that the cost of labour is often relatively
insignificant.
Most European CEMs also say that any cost advantage of manufacturing in the
Far East can easily be offset by intangible costs such as delays in shipping
and loss of design flexibility.
Indeed a number of PC manufacturers have recently brought manufacturing back
from Far East contractors. ICL, for example, stopped buying its systems from
Acer, one of Taiwan's biggest OEM suppliers, following a feasibility study
by consultants KPMG. The machines are manufactured by ICL at its plant in
Ashton-under-Lyne.
ICL also acts as a contract manufacturer in the UK for Sun Microsystems of
the US. It says that its decision to bring manufacturing back from the Far
East was based partly on increasing volumes and partly because the market
was changing.
It found that the benefits of Far Eastern cheap labour were being
out-weighed by the disadvantages - higher import duties, reconfiguration on
arrival, the logistics of product being at sea for six weeks, arms length
quality and technology changes leading to obsolete stock.
Mr Gordon Stewart of consultants Pittiglio Rabin Todd and McGrath argues
that the demands placed on contract manufacturers have changed. 'Two issues
are shaping the future of contract electronics manufacturing: volume
flexibility and design integration.'
He says that price and quality are a given. 'The keys to competitiveness now
are responsiveness - lead times, volumes - and the capacity to integrate
manufacturing and test processes into an OEM's own product development
strategy.'
But at an ACeM conference last year he also cautioned that many contract
manufacturers fell a long way short of these expectations and only got by
because few OEMs could manage a contractor relationship professionally.
Mr Duffett, the ACeM's director, acknowledges that for many managers, who
are used to in-house manufacturing using bought-in piece parts, farming out
work with independent CEMs represents a significant change of practice,
calling for a radically new buyer/supplier relationship.
'The days of arm's length negotiations with choices based solely on lowest
price and shortest delivery are over,' he says.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (3): Born with a
silver spoon in its mouth - Profile of Quantum Electronics Manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUANTUM Electronics Manufacturing was born with an industrial silver spoon
in its mouth.
Formed in January last year after a management buyout from Mitel Telecom, it
inherited a purpose-built electronics plant in South Wales, the latest
manufacturing equipment and a skilled and dedicated workforce used to high
quality customer-driven manufacturing techniques.
The buyout, backed with Pounds 1.2m investment from 3i, the Welsh
Development Agency, Mitel and the Bank of Wales, was organised by a group of
managers who had successfully reorganised Mitel Telecom's operations in
Portskewett, South Wales, following its acquisition by BT.
The Mitel reorganisation released space for the plant, considerable
equipment and other resources.
Initially in March 1990 the managers, led by Dr Terry Summers, the plant's
materials director, won the backing of Mitel to establish a sub-contract
manufacturing operation using the plant's surplus resources.
The new manufacturing operation concentrated on low volume high technology
contracts emphasising responsiveness to its customers. But the business
required more capital investment and management time than Mitel could spare,
so the management buy-out was organised and approved at the start of last
year.
Since then Quantum's workforce has grown from 39 to more than 60, turnover
is running at an annual rate of Pounds 4m and, despite the recession, the
young company is already trading profitably. 'We are growing by the day,'
says Dr Summers, who is now Quantum's managing director. Recently 3i, Mitel
and British Coal Enterprise backed a Pounds 200,000 capital increase to
support further growth.
Its customers include National Transcommunications, Inmos, the chip
manufacturer, Research Machines, Encrypta, Thermocouple Instruments and
Rediffusion Simulation.
Altogether the company has between 15 and 20 customers who mostly require
low to medium volume contract manufacturing using leading edge technology,
sophisticated test equipment and advanced computer based manufacturing
systems organised on a cellular basis.
Like many other smaller players in the contract manufacturing business
Quantum is a niche player, mostly serving customers in the business,
industrial and professional sectors. None of its customers manufactures the
assemblies which Quantum makes. 'We are their manufacturing department,'
says Summers.
Although Quantum does not design for its customers it does like its project
engineers to be involved at the design stage to help ensure that the design
is compatible with high quality and low cost automated manufacturing.
It also prefers to buy the components because Dr Summers says this gives
Quantum more control over quality and its customers are usually happy
because 'more and more they are getting out of manufacturing'.
Production is organised on a cellular rather than production line basis and
capabilities include conventional hand assembly, automated assembly using
plated-through-hole (PTH) components, surface mount technology (SMT), mixed
technology and electro-mechanical assemblies.
Most contracts are in the 1,000-3,000 board range with values of between
Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m although Quantum does some high tech, low
volume work with contracts valued at as little as Pounds 100,000.
Where Dr Summers believes Quantum scores over some of its larger rivals is
in being able to provide customers with a highly flexible personalised
service using leading edge technology such as SMT 'normally only associated
with bigger companies'. It can also handle extremely complex products.
'Quantum's roots in an international electronics corporation gives us a
unique insight into the needs of the industry,' Dr Summers declares in the
company's sales literature.
'Our track record in the application of the most advanced manufacturing
techniques will give you the competitive edge you need.'
He also believes Quantum's niche business is more secure and less risky than
that of many of the larger players. He argues, for example, that because
volumes are low there is little incentive for customers to consider going
offshore with their business. 'They need people in the UK,' he says.

being achieved - Profile of Electronics Design and Manufacturing Services

A STATEMENT hangs on the reception wall of Electronics Design and
Manufacturing Services' purpose-built headquarters at Maldon, Essex.
It says simply: 'Our aim is to establish EDMS as a significant force in
contract manufacturing, primarily focusing on the needs of multi-technology
based companies. We will achieve this by providing a quality manufacturing
facility, with a professionally minded, technically capable workforce, and
by developing a 'Partnership in Production' with all our customers and
suppliers.'
EDMS appears to be well on the way to achieving its primary objectives. The
company was originally a department within Industrial Control Services,
supplying circuit boards for the UK-based international electronic safety
systems group which obtained a Stock Exchange listing last year.
But it became a separate, fully owned ICS subsidiary in 1986 and has since
grown quickly, moving into its custom-built 20,000 sq ft factory in 1990.
Today, according to Mr John Reid, EDMS's managing director, only 10-15 per
cent of its business comes from the parent company.
Although EDMS made a small operating loss in the year to May 31 last year,
it has moved back into profit since then. In the first half it made an
operating profit and should be profitable at the pre-tax level in the
current second half, says Mr Andrew Leeser, group financial director.
Contract manufacturing is, it seems, recession proof in terms of volume, but
not in terms of margins.
EDMS's volumes have doubled in two years from Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m-Pounds
12m this year, reflecting growing interest in contract electronics in its
prime computing, industrial, telecommunications, medical and consumer
electronics markets.
Its customer base includes companies such as Acorn (EDMS produces
motherboards for Acorn's educational computers), Reuters, Unicam and British
Telecom. It exports its products throughout the UK and Europe where it
distributes directly to Reuter's customers.
EDMS is a principally a niche player producing 'specialised products in
(relatively) small volumes,' says Mr Reid. The service spans the range from
prototype and small batch fast-turn around projects to medium volume
production.
In particular, EDMS has targeted consumer goods manufacturers who are
replacing electro-mechanical controls and incorporating sophisticated
electronics into their products for the first time.
Since they lack the capital equipment or in-house electronics expertise,
they represent a prime opportunity for innovative contract electronics
manufacturers whose design engineers can work with them and produce
electronic controls based on the latest surface mount technology (SMT).
Mr Reid sees 'a big growth opportunity' for companies whose core business
relies on using SMT. Companies moving from mechanical to electronic controls
'are going straight to SMT', he says.
These days EDMS can provide customers with a cad/cam service to lay out
cards using the latest surface mount technology. It also has a product
engineer who spends one or two days a week with customers helping to design
products to ensure that when it comes to manufacturing, 'we have taken out a
lot of cost'.
Mr Reid, who is due to become chairman of the Association of Contract
Electronics manufacturers at this month's Nepcon exhibition in Birmingham,
calls this process 'design for manufacturing' or 'cost engineering'.
EDMS is now working with three of its customers on new products from design
to manufacturing using its fully computerised cad/cam system to support
printed circuit board layout. One product is a spectrometer designed in
conjunction with a customer which has transferred all its PCB business to
EDMS.
EDMS is also working with a computer product design house manufacturing a
product to its design for the European market in direct competition with Far
East imports.
To reinforce the 'partnership' between EDMS and its customers a programmes
engineer is appointed to each new customer and retains full responsibility
for that contract including its commercial, financial, technical and
administrative aspects.
The recent rapid growth in the business means that EDMS has already outgrown
its headquarters building which houses the company's Pounds 500,000
investment in fully automated in-line surface mount capability using
Dynapert and Mydata equipment, together with comprehensive in-circuit,
functional and temperature stress testing.
Unlike big companies which need high volumes to support their heavy capital
investment, EDMS's contract volumes are much smaller, but nevertheless often
involve highly complex mixed technology boards. So EDMS uses slower, more
flexible surface mount machines capable of handling a wide range of
components together with a highly skilled workforce which can undertake hand
assembly where required.
A second 7,000 sq ft building which is being renovated will be used for
EDMS's growing board upgrade and repair service and, at the end of last
month, the company moved into a third Maldon manufacturing unit dedicated to
building complete systems.
EDMS has spent Pounds 300,000 on the latest surface mount and test equipment
for the 20,000 sq ft factory which will create jobs for 85 people in
addition to the 150 already employed by the company. All three facilities
are linked and controlled by a computer network which controls all
procurement, manufacturing and finance.
EDMS chose its location carefully. In the early days of contract
manufacturing most customers supplied all the components on a 'consignment'
basis. It was therefore important to site the manufacturing facilities close
to the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to minimise transport costs.
However, these days most customers rely upon the contract manufacturer to
provide a full service including procurement. Physical location has become
much less significant - particularly since most paperwork, and even design
work, can be handled electronically using electronic data interchange (edi)
systems.
Another distinctive feature of today's UK-based contract manufacturers is
their commitment to quality standards. For example, all EDMS operations are
governed by a company-wide quality management programme and all stages of
administration, manufacture and testing are audited to internationally
recognised quality standards.
EDMS is also working to maintain a high level of customer service. It has
opened an office in Grangemouth, Scotland, to support its developing
customer base in Scotland and Ireland. In addition, it has launched a sales
drive to find business in new niche markets in continental Europe.
Mr Reid is very optimistic about the future. 'Britain is the centre in
Europe for contract manufacture,' he says, and he is determined that EDMS
will play a significant role in the development of European CEM.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (1): Farewell to
sweat-shops - A rapidly rising proportion of electronic equipment is now
manufactured on behalf of the big international suppliers by outside
contractors. Paul Taylor probes the reasons for the emergence of this
expanding force within one of the world's predominant industries

CONTRACT electronics manufacturing (CEM) has become the fastest growing
sector of the European electronics industry and is on target to become a
Dollars 22bn global business by the mid-1990s.
In the UK a group of dedicated contract electronics manufacturers have
successfully shaken off the second-rate 'sweat-shop' image of sub-contract
and assembly work in the 1960s by investing heavily in advanced production
and test equipment, training and quality processes.
Today their big customers are blue chip multinationals such as IBM, Sony,
Bosch, Motorola, AEG, and Matsushita which require fast response times,
flexibility and first class quality, as well as cost-effective
manufacturing. These companies are using contract manufacturers as part of
their global strategies to maintain and improve international
competitiveness.
From humble beginnings the UK industry has entered what Mr Bruce Armstrong,
managing director of SCI Europe, describes as its third phase - strategic
global partnerships between OEMs and contract manufacturers which can
provide full turnkey services from design and printed circuit board layout,
through to product distribution.
A handful of factors have fuelled the growth in CEM over the past decade. In
particular, the pace of technological change has resulted in shortened
product life cycles requiring increased manufacturing flexibility and
worldwide manufacturing capability. In order to remain competitive in fast
moving consumer-led markets companies have had to reduce the period it takes
to bring new products to market.
At the same time electronic controls are replacing electro-mechanical
devices in many consumer products such as cars and medical equipment whose
manufacturers have little or no electronics manufacturing experience or
capacity.
Meanwhile, the continuing push for smaller, more portable but more
sophisticated products such as mobile phones and notebook computers requires
greater silicon integration and results in more complex devices. These are
best manufactured using advanced techniques for placing components on
printed circuit boards such as surface mount technology which require
expensive specialist machinery and expertise to design, assemble and test
and which involve considerable 'manufacturing risk' because of market
volatility.
The trend towards CEM also mirrors the move towards buying in a wide range
of service and other peripheral corporate functions, backed by the
management theory that organisations should focus on their 'core
competencies' and contract out every thing else - creating what some
observers have called 'the virtual corporation'.
Recessionary pressures have forced some managements to reconsider the 'make
or buy' decision. But generally, although contract manufacturing can result
in cost savings, most participants argue this should not be the primary
motivation.
The arrival of the single European market has encouraged many Japanese and
other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to set up locally in Europe.
As MHM, a market research organisation based in Ayr, Scotland, noted in its
latest study of the European CEM market, business from these companies 'has
fuelled spectacular expansion in at least one CEM house'.
MHM describes the growth of the UK market in the 1980s as 'spectacular'. The
turnover of the six largest sub-contract companies in the UK, SCI, Race,
Avex, AB, Philips, Welwyn and Timex, grew by an average 42 per cent per year
between 1984 and 1990.
Growth has slowed considerably since then, in part reflecting the recession
and the sharp price war in the computer and IT sector which accounts for a
still large, but declining, proportion of the CEM industry order book - a
trend which has been partly offset by increased demand from new customers in
the automotive, telecommunications and industrial sectors.
According to the Association of Contract Electronics Manufacturers (ACeM),
part of the Electronic Components Industry Federation (ECIF), formed in 1990
to provide a voice for the emerging industry, the overall UK market was
worth about Pounds 550m last year, and is growing at an underlying annual
rate of 10-15 per cent. ACeM membership now totals 48 contractors
representing 70-80 per cent of the UK CEM industry which, despite being
capital intensive, employs around 10,000 people.
'Rapid growth over the last 10 years has resulted in a fragmented industry
expanding on the back of a rapidly expanding electronics industry,' said Mr
Eric Luckwell, chairman of Datalink Services, a small Loughborough-based
CEM, in a study of the UK market.
'The capability of these organisations ranges from the very high volume and
complex technological process, such as surface mount technology and
automatic component insertion, to the very low volume and simple labour
intensive processes,' he said.
Mr Derek Duffett, ACeM director, groups the UK CEM market into four groups.
Large companies dedicated to contract electronics include SCI and Avex,
Scottish subsidiaries of US groups, which are also multinationals in their
own right and whose main business is high volume, low margin work for big
OEMs.
Their particular strengths are their capacity, sophisticated automated
manufacturing systems, substantial component purchasing power and worldwide
facilities. 'Our customers are global, so are we,' says Carol Brannigan,
Avex Electronic's European sales and marketing director and chairman of
ACeM's Promotions Committee.
'European customers and global companies operating in Europe are telling us
they need total product life cycle management services not just PCB assembly
and test,' she says. In response big CEMs are building what she calls 'a
transparent or seamless partnership' linking CEM and customer using
electronic data interchange (EDI), integrated MRP (Materials Requirement
Planning) systems, CAD/CAM design systems and electronic mail.
Medium-sized dedicated CEMs are the second group. These generally maintain
close links with OEM design houses working in specialist applications areas,
such as the industrial and professional markets. Almost half of ACeM's
membership falls into this category with most companies employing between
100 and 500 people. They include Welwyn Systems, the contract electronics
subsidiary of the TT Group which also acquired AB Contract Electronics last
year, and Race Electronics. Small start-up companies, the third group,
emphasise their flexibility and personalised service, particularly to
entrepreneurial businesses which may want prototypes built and tested or
require low to medium manufacturing volumes.
The in-house contracting departments of original equipment manufacturers.
These units have been created to fill spare capacity or diversify into new
areas. Established players include Philips Circuit assemblies and Rank-Xerox
Manufacturing Services. These companies often have access to specialised
environmental and test equipment in design and failure analysis.
Recently they have been joined by other OEMs with excess capacity which,
together with the arrival in Europe of new Far East competitors such as
Flextronics, is causing concern in an industry which arguably already has
excess capacity and thin margins.
'Presently the CEM industry can stand the additional capacity better than
many other mature electronics sectors,' said the MHM report, 'but this
situation will not continue indefinitely.'
An industry shake-out and reorganisation is widely expected amid forecasts
that the industry will become increasingly polarised between the high
volume, low margin multinational CEMs, and the much smaller niche companies.
Mr Gordon Stewart, UK director of specialist management consultants
Pittiglio Rabin Todd &amp; McGrath, told an ACeM conference in October that the
dominant feature of the CEM industry in the 1990s will be the performance
gap between an emerging super- league of multinational manufacturers and a
horde of increasingly marginalised smaller competitors.
Because the UK market is maturing most of the large CEMs are adopting the
twin strategies of trying to win back business which has gone offshore,
particularly to the Far East, while also expanding overseas themselves.
Armed with internationally accepted quality assurance standards and total
quality management programmes the UK's leading CEMs have been stressing the
importance of looking at total costs - including loss of flexibility and
transport delays - in their attempts to win back offshore business, and have
been having some success. They are also helped by the increasingly capital
intensive nature of the business, which means that labour cost differentials
are growing less important.
However, they are handicapped by the prevailing duty and tariff structure
which provides a significant incentive to import printed circuit boards or
fully built equipment, which are mostly subject to a 4.5 per cent tariff,
rather than semiconductors and other components which are generally subject
to a 14 per cent tariff. The ACeM has begun to campaign for a more even
playing field, arguing that a tariff change could help generate thousands of
manufacturing jobs in the UK.
At the same time some CEMs have begun to establish footholds on the
continent. The UK CEM market is considerably more developed than most of its
European counter parts. The Germany market in particular is expected to grow
rapidly and, together with France, is attracting attention.
Overall the European CEM market is reckoned to be worth about Dollars 6bn -
which still leaves OEMs undertaking the vast majority of electronics
manufacturing in-house. Despite their growth contract manufacturers have
still only captured a fraction of the potential European market.
Arguably, of all the changes in the electronics industry over the past
decade, the one that has gone most unnoticed, has been the emergence of
quality contract electronics manufacturers. That is now changing.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: German rate cut hopes propel European
prices higher

EUROPEAN bond prices ended mostly higher yesterday, boosted by growing
expectations of a German rate cut.
GERMAN bond prices closed  1/8 point firmer as expectations that the
Bundesbank will cut rates at its council meeting on Thursday gained ground.
A weekend agreement by the German government on a package of austerity
measures, known as the solidarity pact, has prompted strong speculation that
the Bundesbank will not be able to hold out any longer against pressure for
a cut in official interest rates. However, the market fell from overnight
highs in Tokyo.
The agreement 'makes it easier for the Bundesbank to cut rates because its
creates a more organised fiscal structure,' said Mr Klaus Baader, an
economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He added that the fundamental effect was
very small, but 'it caps the potential for chaos in public sector
financing'.
The Euro D-Mark future on Liffe also benefited from mounting expectations of
a cut. The March contract ended at 92.19, up from a previous close of 92-10.
UK GILT prices ended slightly higher in very thin trading. The market is
expected to remain in suspense until today's government Budget statement.
THE DUTCH government sold Fl 1.4bn of the new 10-year state bond yesterday.
Dutch bond prices rose in line with the German bond market.
THE Czech Republic has launched a Kcs2.5bn domestic Treasury bond issue  -
the first such issue for more than 50 years - which has been fully
pre-placed with domestic investors. The four-year issue, arranged by Credit
Suisse First Boston, carries a fixed coupon of 14.6 per cent.
'There are enough domestic investors willing to lend the government money.
The response has been better than expected for an entirely new instrument.
It also shows investors' confidence following the break-up of (the former)
Czechoslovakia (in January),' said an analyst with CSFB.
The proceeds will be used to help finance a 1991 budget deficit of Kcs9.9bn.
US Treasury prices opened firmly then fell at the long end of the maturity
range after rising commodity prices had revived fears of inflation.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/2 at 102
27/32 , yielding 6.896 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.066 per cent.
Prices opened higher, buoyed by comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, who at the weekend said that the recovery remained
'tentative'.
The market then suffered a mid-morning setback, however, after the
Commodities Research Bureau index jumped more than 2 1/2 points to 210.41.
The CRB's rise, which some dealers said was a reaction to Saturday's huge
snowstorm that hit the eastern US states and may have an impact on some
crops, showed higher prices among a broad range of commodities.
The rise in the CRB unsettled Treasury investors, who fear that inflationary
pressures may be building up in the economy as the recovery gathers pace.
Last week the February producer prices index increased more than expected,
and with yesterday's CRB rise, dealers and investors are nervously awaiting
the February consumer prices report, which is due out tomorrow.

THE SWISS federal cabinet yesterday abolished stamp tax on Swiss franc bond
issuance by foreign borrowers with effect from April 1, AP-DJ reports from
Zurich.
It was feared the 0.15 per cent tax on secondary market purchases, and 0.30
per cent tax on primary market purchases, would see Swiss franc bond
issuance by foreign borrowers move from Switzerland to foreign marketplaces.
The federal council was given the power to remove the stamp tax in a
national referendum on September 27.
Also, according to the Swiss finance ministry, a rule requiring that Swiss
franc foreign bonds be syndicated by banks located in Switzerland, would be
replaced by a regulation requiring only that the lead manager of the issue
be located in Switzerland and not the entire syndicate.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Internationa Bonds: KfW raises DM1.5bn as German currency
dominates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark sector of the international bond market was active yesterday as
domestic and foreign borrowers decided that the time was right to lock into
German interest rates.
The Bundesbank is widely expected to cut its leading interest rates at its
council meeting on Thursday, following agreement at the weekend on the
public financing for the 'solidarity pact' for the east German economy.
Syndicate managers said the rate cut had been discounted by the market.
'Many issuers feel that German interest rates are close to the bottom of
their cycle for now,' one syndicate manager at a German bank said.
KfW International Finance USA, the financing arm of the triple-A rated
German government agency for redevelopment, raised DM1.5bn through an issue
of 10-year Eurobonds.
The bonds will be priced today, and are expected to yield 14 basis points
over the 7 1/8 per cent bund due December 2003, the lower end of the
indicated range. The bund yielded 6.54 per cent yesterday afternoon.
An official at the lead manager, Dresdner Bank, said that the bonds were
widely distributed at home and elsewhere in Europe.
For some syndicate managers, the indicated yield spread on KfW's bonds
appeared to be on the safe side, in order to allow some room for
performance. They expected the spread to narrow to 12 basis points when the
bonds were freed to trade. However, Dresdner said the bonds were fairly
priced, in view of the 26 basis-point spread between yields on 10-year bunds
and domestic bonds.
By contrast, there was general agreement in the market that the pricing on
the Kingdom of Denmark's DM700m five-year Eurobond issue was tight. The
bonds yielded 10 basis points over the series 105 of medium-term German
government bonds. Some syndicate managers believed that it would be
difficult for the bonds to keep to the launch spread once they were freed to
trade, which is likely to happen early today.
WestLB, the lead manager, reported good demand for the bonds from central
banks, attracted by their five-year maturity and the fact that the borrower
is an European Community member.
Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the debt department, foreign area, at Denmark's
National Bank, said that the proceeds from the issue were for the foreign
exchange reserves of the central bank. The issue will almost complete the
central bank's first-quarter borrowing programme of DKr12bn.
Mr Sorensen said the issue also lengthened the bank's debt maturity profile,
which prior to yesterday's deal was about 1 1/2 years.
'We wanted to take out some longer-term debt now that German rates have come
down,' he said.
CCF took advantage of investors' hopes of lower interest rates in France to
raise FFr500m worth of five-year reverse floating rate notes, its second
such issue since November.
The joint lead manager, Morgan Stanley, said the bonds were sold throughout
Europe and were trading at their issue price late yesterday.

THE German Banking Federation, representing the commercial banking sector,
yesterday agreed to make a formal complaint to Brussels about new rules
allowing Germany's powerful state banks to register a big increase in their
asset base.
The big private sector banks, including Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and
Commerzbank, are furious at the new ruling which allows the state banks to
include the assets of their housing finance subsidiaries in their working
capital base, and thus greatly extend their lending activities.
Mr Eberhard Martini, president of the banking federation, said a letter
would be sent to the European Commission immediately after yesterday's
annual meeting, asking whether the new rules conformed to EC guidelines on
capital adequacy.
The main target of the banks is the Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) which
has succeeded in extending its working capital by DM4bn as a result of
consolidating the assets of WFA, the housing finance institution for North
Rhine-Westphalia.
Mr Martini said that the new ruling, made by the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das
Kreditwesen, the supervisory body for the banking sector, gave the public
sector banks a significant competitive advantage over private sector banks.

<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday said it was
reviewing the short-term debt rating of Volvo, the Swedish motor vehicle
group, with a view to a possible downgrade, following a sharp increase in
group debt and higher operating losses in 1992.
S&amp;P said it had placed Volvo's single-A1 rating on Creditwatch with negative
implications, but noted that the rating was unlikely to fall below single A2
because of the group's 'reasonable financial flexibility'.
Last week, Volvo announced a SKr4.75bn loss after financial items, compared
with a SKr1.5bn profit in 1991, with operating losses rising to SKr2.25bn
from SKr1.17bn. Net debt amounted to SKr13bn, up sharply from SKr7bn in
1991, with around SKr2bn attributed to currency fluctuations.
S&amp;P said: 'In the face of continuing difficult trading conditions in its key
markets, Volvo is constrained in its ability to contain debt useage. Debt is
expected to remain higher for the foreseeable future.'
Last December, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Volvo's commercial paper
ratings to Prime-2 from Prime-1.

INCHCAPE Timuran, the Malaysian trading group, has posted a 47 per cent fall
in group pre-tax profits to MDollars 13.34 (USDollars 5m) for 1992 from
MDollars 25.31m in 1991, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Turnover rose slightly to MDollars 376.32m from MDollars 346.52m. Inchcape
said earnings were hit by slower growth in sales of consumer products and
high interest rates while exports were hurt by the strengthening of the
Malaysian dollar.
The company was cautious about 1993, saying an easing of credit restrictions
had yet to lift sales of consumer goods.
Boustead, the Malaysian conglomerate, unveiled net profits of MDollars

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Astra makes sweeping changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA International, the Indonesian motor company, has made sweeping
boardroom changes prior to announcing its 1992 results which, brokers say,
will show a 59 per cent fall in net profits to Rp87bn (Dollars 42m).
The changes follow the forced sale in January by the Soeryadjaya family,
Astra's founders, of their majority stake in the company. Three of four
family members have left the board, including Mr Edwin Soeryadjaya, formerly
vice-president.
Mr Oskar Surjaatmadja, a former director-general of the ministry of finance
and currently chairman of the Jakarta stock exchange, has been appointed
president commissioner, equivalent to company chairman.
Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who led the consortium which bought into the
Soeryadjaya stake, has become vice-president commissioner, while his close
business colleague, Mr Henry Pribadi, has been made commissioner.
The senior management responsible for the company's day-to-day affairs
remains largely unchanged, quelling investors' fears that the sale by the
Soeryadjayas could prompt an exodus of top personnel.
The Soeryadjayas still own, directly or through nominee companies, more than
13 per cent of Astra but are expected further to reduce their stake to repay
debts associated with their privately-owned Bank Summa, which collapsed in
December owing Rp1,600bn.
Liquidators, led by the central bank, have currently agreed to repay large
clients half their deposits. They hope to raise further finance by selling
off the Soeryadjayas' extensive property interests.
Astra has yet officially to announce its 1992 figures, but brokers have been
privately informed that net profits slumped to Rp87bn from Rp210bn in 1991.
The company's vehicle sales fell 32 per cent to 97,239 units, although it
increased market share year-on-year to 56.5 per cent from 54 per cent.
The net profits are higher than brokers' forecasts, reflecting a recovery in
the last quarter.
Nevertheless, some new shareholders are reportedly keen to restructure Astra
and possibly dispose of non-core businesses, which include timber, palm oil
plantation and telecommunications subsidiaries.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Losses deepen at Aerospatiale
</HEADLINE>

FRANCE'S two leading aircraft makers yesterday provided further evidence of
the problems afflicting the industry. Aerospatiale revealed a loss of
between FFr1.5bn (Dollars 265m) and FFr2bn for last year, and Dassault
Aviation forecast a small profit on reduced turnover this year.
In an interview with Les Echos, published yesterday, Mr Louis Gallois,
president of state-owned Aerospatiale, said that the losses, after a
first-half deficit of FFr477m, had deepened in the last six months of 1992.
Turnover last year was FFr51bn, but Mr Gallois forecast that 1993 would be
'a year of dead water, without dramas but without any pick-up in the
market'.
Dassault executives said the company's turnover would fall about 10 per cent
this year from the FFr14.4bn level recorded in the past two years.
However, profit would be of the same order of around FFr100m achieved in
1992 and 1991 because the company had cut costs and personnel, with the
latter falling to 10,000 by end-1993.
But the Dassault officials were more optimistic about the company's
medium-term future. Orders booked last year rose to FFr21.5bn, thanks
largely to the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighters to Taiwan, a contract which
Dassault coyly still refuses to confirm publicly because of China's hostile
reaction to the deal.
By 1995, when Dassault's new range of business jet, the Falcon 2000, starts
rolling off the production line, the company expects turnover to start
rising again.
Senior Dassault executives said it might be 'a good idea' if the new
conservative government, which is expected to take power after this month's
elections, were to include the company in its privatisation programme and
sell some of the French state's 46 per cent stake in the company.
Sextant Avionique, the avionics joint venture between Aerospatiale and
Thomson CS, also forecast its turnover would continue to fall this year.
But, like Dassault Aviation, it recorded an increase in orders booked last
year.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Doubts put share price surge on
the line for NTT investors - A look into the background to the turnround in
the Japanese group's stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS difficult not to regard the rally in the share price of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's telecommunications group, with at least a
degree of suspicion.
After sliding steadily for the past five years, the country's most
widely-held stock has gained 31.5 per cent in just 10 days from Y616,000 on
February 26 to Y810,000 on March 12. Yesterday, the issue took a breather
and closed down Y7,000 at Y803,000 (Dollars 6,819).
NTT's dramatic rise was the force behind last week's 1,219.82-point surge on
the Tokyo stock exchange which took the Nikkei index over 18,000 for the
first time since September 25.
The ostensible trigger for the new surge in NTT has been a number of
developments suggesting the group may at last be finding its way out of a
situation in which it faces growing competition, falling market share and
slumping profits.
In the past few weeks there have been hints that the semi-private
telecommunications group may be allowed to raise its call rates, and
comments by senior government officials indicating they are keen to support
the issue. In addition, there has been talk of public investment projects in
a new telecommunications infrastructure.
The combination of these developments has spurred excitement over the
group's near-term prospects.
But the timing of the rise in NTT, just before corporate Japan closes its
accounts at the end of this month, arouses suspicions as to whether the fact
these developments have all come at the same time is merely a coincidence.
'It was very cleverly timed,' says an analyst at Nomura Research Institute,
the research arm of Nomura Securities. If any of the positive factors cited
are realised, it would be good news for NTT.
For example, reducing the time of a call from Y10 for three minutes to Y10
for 90 seconds - the likely in a rate rise - would double NTT's operating
profits by 1994, according to Mr Eric Gan, industry analyst at Kleinwort
Benson.
In recent months, NTT has been lobbying heavily for a rise, fuelling
speculation it has won some government support for its case.
'The time has finally come when we must really push for a price rebalance.
Unless we do something the situation is going to affect our capital
investments,' said Mr Tomeo Kanbayashi, vice-president. He was speaking at
the group's announcement of its business plan for 1993 which was submitted
to the ministry of posts and telecommunications last month.
The group has announced a restructuring programme to reduce the number of
employees by 30,000 over the next three years and retail outlets by a third.
Comments made by a government official last week, accepting the need for an
increase in pay phone rates, seemed to suggest government sympathy for NTT's
cause.
NTT enthusiasts argue that the government, which still owns 65 per cent of
NTT shares, has plenty of reasons for wanting to see the share price rise.
More than any other issue, NTT symbolises the hopes, and fears, of Japan's
individual investors, many of whom invested in stocks for the first time
when the government sold its first tranche in February 1987 for Y1.19m a
share. By April 22 1987, the shares had climbed to a peak of Y3.18m.
However, a series of financial scandals, the plunge in the Tokyo stock
market and concerns over NTT's business prospects led to a spectacular fall
in the share price.
In the past three years, the issue has lost 80 per cent of its value,
hitting an all-time low of Y453,000 last August.
Individual investors have become thoroughly disillusioned with NTT, with the
brokers who recommended the issue and the authorities who appeared to have
betrayed the public trust.
A strong rise in NTT would go a long way to lifting investor sentiment and
help prepare the way for the launch this August of shares in JR East, a
regional railway company created by the break-up of the state-owned Japan
Railways, and in Japan Tobacco, in future.
The ministry of finance, which has been forced to postpone a fourth sale of
NTT shares due to the market's weakness, could also do with the income to
help pay for Japan's emergency spending package.
Furthermore, a rise in NTT's share price would help many of its corporate
shareholders before the closing of their books this month.
Thus, the government could kill several birds with one stone by ensuring
that NTT's share price rises.
The third bullish factor supporting NTT's rise has been the idea of a public
works project focused on a new telecommunications infrastructure to
stimulate the sagging domestic economy.
However, there is little concrete evidence to suggest that NTT will be able
to get what it wants. The ministry of posts and telecommunications, has
publicly expressed no sympathy for a rate hike in anything but pay phones.
On the contrary, the ministry has continued to take a hard stance on an
increase in other local call rates.
'We believe that if NTT restructures its local call operations it could
actually make a profit there. If that happens, NTT may end up subsidising
its long-distance operations, where it faces competition, with profits from
its local call business, where it has a monopoly,' says Mr Kazuhiro Suda,
director of the tariff division in the ministry's telecommunications bureau.
Meanwhile, plans for a government project to build a new telecommunications
infrastructure have been roundly criticised by the ministry of international
trade and industry, which believes such a move would undermine the whole
purpose of having privatised NTT in the first place.
The question for investors then is how far those who are interested in
talking up the share price are prepared to go, and, perhaps more crucially,
how long will other investors be prepared to believe them.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Pfizer wins ruling on heart
valve case review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PFIZER, one of the fastest-growing US pharmaceutical companies, has won a
favourable ruling in a California Supreme Court regarding litigation over
the company's Shiley heart valve.
The company had petitioned the court to ask the Court of Appeal to review
two cases which would allow out-of-state recipients of the Shiley valve to
file lawsuits in California. The Supreme Court granted Pfizer's petition,
paving the way for the decision to be re-examined.
The California decision is important for Pfizer because California courts
are believed to be more supportive of consumers than other courts.
Pfizer has been trying to keep the Shiley litigation out of California,
especially for patients who do not reside in the state.
The earlier court decision ruled that foreign valve recipients did not have
the same constitutional rights as US citizens to sue in California. About
50,000 people have received the heart valves made by Pfizer's California
unit.
Pfizer, which has been trying to put the Shiley litigation to rest for
several years, last year filed a comprehensive plan in a Cincinnati court,
including a Dollars 215m class action settlement and an additional Dollars
300m in reserves to settle fracture claims.
The plan was accepted by the court but in Pennsylvania is awaiting a federal
appeals court review.
Smith Corona, the US maker of portable typewriters, has predicted a
substantial decline in third-quarter earnings. The company, 48 per cent
owned by the Hanson group of the UK, blamed lacklustre economic recovery in
the US and recession in Europe for its disappointing outlook.
Although the company expects a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings, it
expects to remain in the black. In last year's third quarter to March 31,
Smith Corona earned Dollars 4.9m, or 16 cents a share.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: A troublesome brew in Germany's
chemical industry - Recession, state intervention, a rising D-Mark and
competition are responsible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chemicals industry is dismayed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision that
the rump of its east German counterpart will be a core element in the
region's recovery programme. On the Treuhand privatisation agency's plan to
spend another DM1bn this year on restructuring in the east, Mr Wolfgang
Hilger, Hoechst chairman, (left) asks if the government is not filling a
bottomless bucket.
ONE of the more predictable features of recession is that it eventually goes
away. But there are few consolations to the other spectres stalking
Germany's chemicals industry.
Some are familiar. High labour and environmental costs have haunted
manufacturers for years. Now, with government intervention, the rise of the
D-Mark and the rapid increase in competition from low-cost manufacturers in
Asia and elsewhere, labour and environmental costs are disturbing German
management's sleep more than they used to.
The effects of medical service reforms, imposed from January by Mr Horst
Seehofer, the new health minister, have had a dramatic immediate effect on
the pharmaceuticals trade.
This was underlined this week when BASF followed its announcement of a 41
per cent profits slump last year with news that short-time working was to be
introduced at its Knoll drugs subsidiary.
BASF said sales of some prescription drugs fell by 40 per cent in the first
two months of Mr Seehofer's reforms.
Apart from prescription limits and higher charges for patients, the industry
is having to cope with stringent price controls and cuts.
Drugs, traditionally the non-cyclical buffer cushioning German chemical
company profits, now seem drained of their power to protect.
According to Mr Jochen Huckmann, a spokesman for the pharmaceuticals
industry in the state of Hesse, the net effect of Mr Seehofer's economy
package will be a reduction in earnings of between 20 and 30 per cent.
He estimates that local manufacturers, which account for almost 20 per cent
of all German drugs output, suffered an average 24 per cent fall in sales
during January.
Meanwhile, at the bulk chemicals end of the production scale, the area most
sensitive to cyclical swings, the industry has been dismayed by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's decision that the rump of east German industry is to be
retained as a core element in the region's recovery programme.
Remarking on the Treuhand privatisation agency's plan to spend another DM1bn
this year on restructuring, Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman of Hoechst,
questioned mildly if there were markets enough to absorb the east's output.
He asked, more sharply, if investments on this scale were sensible and if
the government was not committing itself to filling a bottomless bucket.
The answers appear clear enough. But, in the absence of discernible signs of
new industrial growth in the former DDR, the government is not going to
change its mind.
Meanwhile, although Bonn may ease some of its more rigorous strictures on
the health service, Mr Seehofer's intervention and trends in international
markets indicate that margins and profits will continue to be squeezed.
How successfully the German industry picks its way across this dramatically
altered landscape remains to be seen. The direction it has taken has been
clear for some time, but the pace has been slow and hesitant.
Although average profits fell by 25 per cent in 1990 and 20 per cent in
1991, it was not until last year, when earnings fell 30 per cent, that there
was serious reduction in the numbers of people employed. More than 20,000
jobs are expected to go this year - following a mere 8,000 job cuts in 1992.
Structural adjustment has also been sluggish and not always successful.
Among Germany's big three, BASF is most dependent on mainstream chemicals.
Accordingly, it has suffered most.
Ironically, most of BASF's difficulties stem from its 'non-chemical'
activities, which include heavy lossmakers such as magnetic tapes.
These businesses, which together account for some 48 per cent of sales, are
estimated to contribute just 2 per cent of profits. But change is coming -
through a DM4.6bn investment in a pipeline network, which will bring in
Russian gas and oil, plus a stable flow of profits. Energy interests already
account for around 25 per cent of group earnings.
Meanwhile, the company is trying to escape Germany's high-cost trap by
placing chemicals investment abroad.
A new steam cracker opens in Antwerp later this year, for example, and 60
per cent of the group's European spending outside the home market this year
will go to the Belgian site. In another more recent structural move, it
swapped its acrylics business for ICI's polypropylene interests.
Both strategies are driven by BASF's conviction that building up critical
mass and a cost-competitive edge in core sectors will help it resist the
capacity cuts widely believed necessary in the European chemicals industry.
It hopes this will enable it to emerge from the anticipated bloodletting in
the European chemicals sector relatively unscathed.
The recent decision by Hoechst to merge its PVC activities with Wacker
Chemie, accompanied by reorganisation at Celanese, was aimed at the same
end.
Bayer sits on its laurels as the first of Germany's big three to bite
decisively into its costs. Until now, it has been a distinct favourite among
investors, who are content with the estimated 75 per cent contribution to
profits from its drugs and information technology businesses. But last
week's 16 per cent fall in annual profits to DM2.7bn showed not even the one
of the big streamlined chemicals companies can escape the grip of world
recession.

CREDIT Lyonnais has become the first foreign bank for many years to assume
majority control over a domestic Peruvian bank.
The French bank has regained control of the Banco de Lima after having a
minority holding for a considerable time.
Legislation hostile to foreign participation had forced Credit Lyonnais to
reduce its original majority stake in the Lima bank to under 20 per cent.
Lima bank was founded in 1952.
To regain overall control, Credit Lyonnais has increased its capital in the
Banco de Lima by Dollars 8m.
The French bank said that it would seek to play a role in the forthcoming
privatisation of Peru's state-owned companies and the development of the
country's capital markets.
Credit Lyonnais holds some Dollars 200m of Peruvian debt paper, including
around Dollars 50m in short-term working capital debt - expected to be the
first to be accepted in privatisations.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: BTP rescue package agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAGNIE BTP, the French bank that specialises in finance for the property
and building sectors, has agreed an emergency rescue package to cut costs
and restructure its finances.
The plan includes a radical reduction of 35 per cent in overheads, chiefly
by shedding 220 staff. BTP, which has been badly affected by the downturn in
the French property market, is also trying to salvage its finances by
transferring FFr3.2bn (Dollars 560m) of property loans to a new company.
The new company will be controlled by BTP's existing shareholders, which
include a number of prominent names in French finance and construction,
including Credit Lyonnais and Credit National, the banks, and the Bouygues
building group.
The BTP board, led by Mr Jean Bayle, chairman, has been trying to finalise
negotiations for the rescue package since last autumn. BTP is the latest in
a long line of French financial groups to have fallen into financial
difficulty because of the precarious state of the property market.
Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled bank which owns 4.1 per cent of BTP,
last week disclosed that it produced its worst results for 20 years in 1992,
partly because of its property problems. Other banks, including Paribas and
Indosuez, have also been hit, as well as the French insurance companies.
However, BTP is one of the most vulnerable institutions given that it
specialises in property. It fell into the red with a net loss of around
FFr720m last year, after making provisions of FFr600m, from net profits of
FFr62m in 1991.
The company said it hoped to break even this year, following the rescue
plan, and to return to 'normal profit levels' in 1994.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: UAP calls on Suez to reopen
talks on Victoire

<TEXT>
UNION DES Assurances de Paris, France's largest insurance group, yesterday
called on Suez, the French holding company, to reopen negotiations about the
future of Victoire, the French insurer, and Colonia, its German subsidiary.
Suez, which has been clouded by bid speculation since the announcement
earlier this month that it made its first-ever loss in 1992, last year broke
off the Victoire talks. UAP, a minority investor in both Suez and Victoire,
had for years hoped to swap its Victoire shares for control of Colonia.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, UAP chairman, said the negotiations 'must be reopened,
sooner or later'. The breakdown of the Victoire talks was seen as a personal
blow for Mr Peyrelevade, a socialist appointee whose position at UAP may be
vulnerable if, as the polls suggest, the conservatives win the elections.
However, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, has refused to reopen
negotiations. Suez said the issue was not on the agenda although it was 'not
inconceivable' that talks would resume in the future.
UAP yesterday also secured shareholder's agreement to acquire a 37.35 per
cent stake in Nordstern, the German insurer which is the most profitable
part of Colonia, from Winterthur, the German financial group, in return for
FFr1.5bn (Dollars 260m) of UAP shares.
The Nordstern investment has been interpreted as an attempt by Mr
Peyrelevade to step up the pressure on Suez by trying to restrict Colonia's
control over the company.
Mr Peyrelevade's manoeuvres might be helped by Suez's recent problems. Suez,
which made a FFr1.8bn loss last year, has been badly affected by the
economic slowdown and by the effects of the Paris property crisis on its
banking activities.
Mr Peyrelevade stressed UAP had not participated in the recent buying of
Suez shares. 'Like many other shareholders, we are very concerned with the
situation at Suez and hope the management can address its problems,' he
said.

ISS, the international industrial cleaning group, reported a 9 per cent
increase in net profits to DKr266m (Dollars 41.49m) in 1992 from DKr244m
last time. Pre-tax profits were up by 15 per cent to DKr374m from DKr332m.
Sales were down to DKr11.35bn from DKr11.80bn, due to divestments, adverse
foreign exchange developments and difficult trading conditions in Sweden and
Brazil.
Earnings per share increased to DKr61 from DKr56. An unchanged DKr10 per
share dividend was proposed. The board also proposed a scrip issue of one
new for five old shares and a share split by which shares of DKr100 face
value will be split into five shares of DKr20 each.
Sales increased in Scandinavia to DKr5.07bn from DKr4.98bn, but operating
profits slipped to DKr288m from DKr305m. Sales were down in both the other
main divisions, to DKr2.94bn from DKr3.34bn in Europe and Brazil and to
DKr3bn from DKr3.21bn in North America.
Operating profits in Europe and Brazil were down to DKr159m from DKr177m,
and in North America to DKr127m from DKr133m.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Euroc profits decline to SKr129m
as sales slide
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROC, the Swedish building materials group, saw 1992 profits after
financial items fall to SKr129m (Dollars 16.9m) from SKr151m a year earlier,
with efforts to cut costs and release capital largely offsetting a big
downturn in the building market. The dividend is being maintained at SKr2
per share.
Sales slumped to SKr9.5bn from SKr10.5bn, with a particularly severe decline
in Sweden and Finland where sales were down 20 to 30 per cent. Operating
income dropped to SKr542m from SKr740m.
The group's performance was helped by a sharp reduction in net financial
expense which fell to SKr396m from SKr593m, after a scaling down of
operations in some markets.
The group sold its stake in Valenciana, the Spanish cement and ready-mix
company, incurring a SKr279m extraordinary loss, but it says the move will
cut its annual financial costs by SKr150m.
Euroc's cement operations improved earnings to SKr124m from SKr39m, but the
building material activities saw profits fall to SKr84m from SKr204m. Losses
within building materials distribution deepened to SKr29m from SKr14m.
Euroc forecasts that it will remain in profit in 1993.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield doubles loss,
holds payout

AVESTA SHEFFIELD, which has become Europe's largest stainless steel group
following the recent merger of Avesta and British Steel's stainless steel
operations, yesterday disclosed a SKr564m (Dollars 72.33m) loss, after
financial items, for 1992.
Weak market conditions were aggravated by merger expenses and the costs of
starting up a new mill, the company said.
The deficit was more than double 1991's SKr248m loss and led the company to
scrap its dividend after a SKr1 per share pay-out in 1991.
'The most important reason for the negative result is that product prices
have fallen more than raw material prices,' the group said. It blamed
industry over-capacity and increased nickel exports from the former eastern
bloc for the fall in prices, while noting that demand was restrained by
recession in many important markets. It said European demand for hot rolled
plate, pipes, tubes and long products fell, while demand for cold rolled
products rose just 1 per cent, compared with a normal 4 to 5 per cent.
Sales amounted to SKr7.59bn, compared with SKr7.39bn in 1991, with SKr842m
generated by British Steel's stainless operations in the two months
following the completion of the merger on November 2. Excluding this
contribution, sales were down 9 per cent.
The overall loss would have been lower but for SKr171m adverse movement in
inventory prices, SKr50m in merger costs, and SKr101m related to the
start-up of the group's hot strip rolling mill in Avesta.
The group originally expected the merger to produce SKr400m of annual cost
savings from 1995, but now says it expects the benefits to be greater and to
take effect as early as 1993.
British Steel owns 40 per cent of the group.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: French dairy products group
static at FFr354m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BONGRAIN, the fast-expanding French cheese and dairy products group, made
static profits of FFr354m (Dollars 62.51m) last year.
The group, which has grown rapidly in recent years through a series of
acquisitions culminating in last summer's deal whereby it took managerial
control of ULN, the ailing French dairy co-operative, also saw sales
stabilise at FFr9.7bn in 1992.
Mr Jean-Hughes Vadot, finance director, said Bongrain had been affected by a
slowdown in consumer spending across all its markets, with the exception of
Germany. He said there had been a sharp slowdown in France, still the
group's biggest market with 47 per cent of sales, particularly in the second
half of the year.
Despite the competitive climate, Bongrain would have registered an increase
in net profits for its ongoing businesses of 7.2 per cent had exchange rates
remained stable.
However, the franc's strength since the autumn currency crisis reduced the
contribution from exports and overall net profits grew below the rate of
inflation by 1.1 per cent from FFr350m in 1991 to 1992's FFr354m.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc Rorer share
buy-back
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC Rorer, the pharmaceuticals unit of France's largest chemicals
group, plans to buy up to 5m of its own shares, worth Dollars 236m at
yesterday's opening price.
The move, intended to support RPR's flagging share price and obtain cheap
capital for an employee benefits trust, is routine in the US. It is unusual
in France, though Rhone-Poulenc, RPR's parent, did announce it was buying
RPR shares last month. Yesterday's operation will lift RPR's earnings per
share by reducing the number of shares outstanding, said the group.
RPR's share price had fallen by roughly 20 per cent over the past nine
months, said Mr Patrick Langlois, chief financial officer. This was in line
with a general fall in US drug companies' shares, which were hit by
investors' fears over the Clinton administration's plans to cut healthcare
spending plus a general shift of interest to industrial companies likely to
benefit more than pharmaceuticals from the US economic revival. 'The whole
sector is undervalued. We think that RPR has significant potential not
recognised in the share price,' he said.
RPR will buy the shares, which amount to 3.6 per cent of its 138.3m shares
in issue, in the open market over an unspecified period starting now. Last
month, Rhone-Poulenc bought an extra 2.05 per cent of its subsidiary, now
68.68 per cent owned by the state-controlled chemicals group. Rhone-Poulenc
said it wanted to show confidence in RPR at a time when RPR's share price
did not reflect its full potential.
The shares being bought by RPR will go into an employee trust to finance a
range of benefits such as savings and stock plans, pensions and healthcare.
Over time, the trust will be free to allocate or sell the shares.
Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest provider of computer services, yesterday
announced that it would offer Pounds 137m (Dollars 196m) to buy out the
remaining 30 per cent minority stake in Hoskyns, its UK subsidiary.
CGS bought 69.3 per cent of Hoskyns, which manages companies' computer
systems, in 1990 and undertook at the time to offer to buy out the rest
before mid-March 1993.
Minority investors are being offered 469p per share, slightly more than the
most recent market price of 462p. CGS paid Pounds 199m, or 330p per share,
for control of Hoskyns in 1990.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ransomes in the black with Pounds 900,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER GRASS growing conditions helped Ransomes, the grass cutting machinery
maker, return to profitability in 1992. The group, however, remained highly
geared.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 900,000 and replaced losses of Pounds
4.6m on turnover 6.7 per cent higher at Pounds 156.6m (Pounds 146.7m).
Aggregate turnover at the America and commercial divisions rose to Pounds
112.7m (Pounds 110.7m) and gave an aggregate operating profit ahead 64 per
cent, from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 6.9m.
The consumer division increased turnover by 22 per cent to Pounds 43.9m
(Pounds 36m) giving an operating profit of Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 600,000).
Tax more than doubled from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.3m - an effective
charge of 48 per cent of profits before the exceptional item - largely
arising out of unrelieved overseas losses.
Currency movements contributed to a rise in gearing from 175 per cent to
about 250 per cent.
Losses per share worked through at 9p, against 17.3p last time.
A Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.5m) exceptional charge was provided for the write
down of assets on the transfer of the Brouwer operation from Canada to the
US.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Tough US trading hits JIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH trading conditions in the United States insurance market and
international reinsurance markets depressed pre-tax profits at JIB Group,
the insurance broker, to Pounds 18.2m in 1992, against Pounds 20.1m.
Lower interest rates also affected the result to leave earnings per share
down 26 per cent, from 13.6p to 10.1p.
A final dividend of 5p is proposed, making a total for the year of 7.5p.
Last year there was a single final of 5p.
'In difficult markets and difficult times we have not done too badly,' said
Mr Nick Cosh, finance director of the company, which is a subsidiary of
Jardine Matheson Holdings.
Turnover increased to Pounds 175.9m (Pounds 168.9m). There was a lower
contribution from the US of Pounds 79.5m (Pounds 80.6m), offset by increases
in the UK and Ireland to Pounds 71.7m (Pounds 66.8m) and Asia Pacific to
Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 21.5m).
Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 176.3m (Pounds 165.2m), partly
because of a number of one-off costs.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Claremont Garments advances to Pounds 8.47m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAREMONT Garments (Holdings), which last summer expanded its business with
Marks and Spencer through the purchase of J&amp;J Fashions, increased pre-tax
profit by 35 per cent, from Pounds 6.28m to Pounds 8.47m, over the 12 months
to December 26.
The share price gained 5p to close at a new high of 345p. It has climbed
from 154p in July 1991, the month that Claremont demerged from Alexon, the
retailer.
J&amp;J and Alexander Milnes, a much smaller buy, added Pounds 27m to turnover,
which increased 60 per cent to Pounds 81.5m (Pounds 50.9m) - of which about
95 per cent goes to M&amp;S. The acquisitions were included for five to six
months.
A 2-for-5 rights issue raised Pounds 22.1m towards total spending of about
Pounds 29m on acquisitions. The extra equity limited the advance in earnings
per share to 19 per cent at 16.4p (13.8p).
Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman, said three of J&amp;J's factories had been closed
and some of its work transferred to Claremont factories. About 400 jobs had
been shed.
A final dividend of 3.95p makes a total of 7.25p (6.5p).
COMMENT
Claremont has benefited both from the resilience of M&amp;S and from its own
management rigour in wringing impressive margins from that business. The
tantalising prospect of similar discipline being imposed on J&amp;J has helped
drive the share price forward. The only surprise in yesterday's results was
the pleasant one of cashflow being much stronger than expected. Most of the
acquisition debt plus Pounds 1.9m of reorganisation costs were rapidly
cancelled out. For the future, apart from J&amp;J, the main scope for organic
growth seems to lie in exports to the Continent. The corporate wear business
has promise but is small and the M&amp;S cocoon becomes a bit of a straitjacket
when the group considers selling to other retailers. A more serious prospect
for medium-term growth is that Claremont will acquire further M&amp;S suppliers.
A conservative pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 11m this year gives a
prospective p/e of nearly 19 times. This is well up with events, but it
remains worth holding as a quality stock.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN LEISURE, the disco and snooker hall operator which is being
investigated by the Serious Fraud Office and is beset by high debt, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 54,000 for the six months to December 31.
Last year there were losses of Pounds 45.8m after a Pounds 34.6m exceptional
charge to cover losses on disposals. Sales fell 10 per cent to Pounds 35.3m
(Pounds 39.1m).
The net interest charge rose from Pounds 3.76m to Pounds 4.1m. Debt was
unchanged at Pounds 76.6m for gearing marginally higher at 227 per cent.
Losses per share were 0.65p (28.6p).
Distributable reserves remained inadequate to pay either the preference or
the ordinary dividend.
Mr Ian Rock, chief executive, said SFO investigations over the takeover of
Midsummer Leisure were continuing but did not affect the daily operation of
the company.
Its bank facilities expire in July by which time it hoped to have worked out
a programme to take the group forward.
During the year the group sold 23 units, and withdrew almost entirely from
France. There were six loss-making units in the UK still to be sold. Mr Rock
said that at this stage he did not envisage the need for more provisions
covering disposal losses.
Debt had not fallen as the units sold had made losses and because there had
been investment in the remaining 125 profitable disco and snooker units, Mr
Rock said.
'There is nothing wrong with the business,' he added. 'The future is
dependent on finding a proper solution to our debt problem.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGOS, the catalogue showroom retailer, is closing its four Chesterman
furniture stores less than a year after they opened, due to disappointing
sales. Chesterman was Argos's first diversification away from its
traditional catalogue business since its demerger from BAT Industries in
1990, writes Neil Buckley.
The retailer said the economic climate had changed since the stores were
conceived, and Chesterman's sales of only Pounds 3m in the trading year to
January 2 were 'significantly below expectations'.
Start-up costs and operating losses for last year were Pounds 6.2m, while
the stores had incurred an operating loss in the trading year to date of
Pounds 1.5m.
The closure costs, estimated at Pounds 12.7m, will be taken as a charge in
the full-year results.

CLAREMONT Garments (Holdings), which last summer expanded its business with

The share price gained 5p to close at a new high of 345p. It has climbed

which increased 60 per cent to Pounds 81.5m (Pounds 50.9m) - of which about
95 per cent goes to M&amp;S. The acquisitions were included for five to six

Claremont has about 10 per cent of the M&amp;S ladies wear market, according to
Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman.
A 2-for-5 rights issue raised Pounds 22.1m towards total spending of about
Pounds 29 on acquisitions.
The extra equity limited the advance in earnings per share to 19 per cent at
16.4p (13.8p).
Mr Wiegand said three of J&amp;J's factories had been closed and some of its
work transferred to Claremont factories. About 400 jobs had been shed.
Much of J&amp;J's senior management had gone, he said. The group also parted
company with Mrs Jenifer Rosenberg, one of the founders, in an out-of-court
settlement involving the payment to her of roughly Pounds 100,000.
Mr David McGarvey, managing director, said the manufacturing side of J&amp;J had
been neglected. It had been a turnover and design-led company rather than
'exploiting the profitability that comes from volume'.
J&amp;J's pre-acquisition operating margins had been about 4 per cent compared
with 13-plus at Claremont. It was hoped to get the combined group average up
from about 8.5 to 10 per cent this year.
Net debt rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3m. On expanded shareholders' funds
gearing stayed at about 15 per cent - lower than expected at the time of the
acquisition.
A proposed final dividend of 3.95p makes a total of 7.25p (6.5p).

Pounds 11.8m, against Pounds 7.6m. Sales rose 62 per cent, from Pounds 29.7m
to Pounds 48m.
Operating profits rose 61 per cent to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 6.77m), and
interest received was Pounds 941,000 (Pounds 823,000) after capitalising
Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 3.1m) of interest payments.
Earnings per share growth was slower, at 20 per cent to 12.1p (10.1p),
because of the full year impact of the share issue in September 1991. A
final dividend of 1.2p (0.6p) is proposed for a total of 1.8p.
Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said the reforms to state funding of care for
the elderly chronically ill, which take effect from April 1, were now
clearer. Funding of Pounds 524m for 1993-94 was adequate, he said, with a
majority commited to the independent sector. The principle of patient's
choice of home had been enshrined in the reforms.
Takare has been in talks with all the social security departments in areas
where it has homes and expected to agree prices and admissions policies with
them all before April 1, Mr Bradshaw said. It had also signed long term
contracts with three health authorities since details of the new system were
announced last autumn.
During 1992 Takare increased its beds from 2,625 to 4,335 and has since
opened another 450 with 720 under construction due to be completed by April
1. Gearing rose from 10 to 41 per cent.
Mr Bradshaw said that although Takare could fund development costs of Pounds
75m over 1993 and 1994 from existing resources, that would take gearing to
an unacceptable level. At the time of the last share issue Takare promised
not to raise more equity for two years. He said the group was looking at
fixing interest rates on its debt.
COMMENT
Takare's impressive growth continues, and there is no reason to doubt that
it can take advantage of the opportunities its market offers. The community
care reforms may cause some short term confusion, but should strengthen its
hand. The only question is of funding the expansion, though even this should
become less of a problem as the base gets larger. Taking capitalised
interest into account, interest cover is slim, and there is every chance of
a rights issue once the moratorium runs out in September. Even so, Takare
has produced good earnings growth even with share issues, reflected in a
prospective p/e of up to 17 on forecasts of about Pounds 14m pre-tax.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ransomes in the black with Pounds 900,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER GRASS growing conditions helped Ransomes, the grass cutting machinery
maker, return to profitability in 1992.
The group, however, remained highly geared.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 900,000 and replaced losses of Pounds
4.6m on turnover 6.7 per cent higher at Pounds 156.6m (Pounds 146.7m).
Aggregate turnover at the America and commercial divisions rose to Pounds
112.7m (Pounds 110.7m) and gave an aggregate operating profit ahead 64 per
cent, from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 6.9m.
The consumer division increased turnover by 22 per cent to Pounds 43.9m
(Pounds 36m) giving an operating profit of Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 600,000).
Tax more than doubled from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.3m - an effective
charge of 48 per cent of profits before the exceptional item - largely
arising out of unrelieved overseas losses.
The charge include a Pounds 200,000 write back of advance corporation tax.
Currency movements contributed to a rise in gearing from 175 per cent to
about 250 per cent.
The debts arise mainly from the 1989 takeover of Cushman in the US and other
acquisitions.
Losses per share worked through at to 9p, down from 17.3p last time.
A Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.5m) exceptional charge was provided for the write
down of assets on the transfer of the Brouwer operation from Canada to the
US.
One analyst said: 'The company will not be able to trade out of its current
difficulties.' Ransomes pointed out, however, that its principal bankers and
institutional lenders continued to be supportive.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Tough US trading leaves JIB at Pounds 18.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH trading conditions in the United States insurance market and
international reinsurance markets depressed pre-tax profits at JIB Group,
the insurance broker, to Pounds 18.2m in 1992, compared with Pounds 20.1m.
Lower interest rates also affected the result to leave earnings per share
down 26 per cent, from 13.6p to 10.1p.
A final dividend of 5p is proposed, making a total for the year of 7.5p.
Last year there was a single final of 5p.
'In difficult markets and difficult times we have not done too badly,' said
Mr Nick Cosh, finance director of the company, which is a subsidiary of
Jardine Matheson Holdings.
Turnover increased to Pounds 175.9m (Pounds 168.9m). There was a lower
contribution from the US of Pounds 79.5m (Pounds 80.6m), offset by increases
in the UK and Ireland to Pounds 71.7m (Pounds 66.8m) and Asia Pacific to
Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 21.5m).
Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 176.3m (Pounds 165.2m), partly
because of a number of one-off costs.
The closure of the Philadelphia and New York offices cost Pounds 1.5m.
Although the dollar strengthened towards the end of the year, foreign
exchange losses earlier in 1992 cost another Pounds 1m.
Income from associated undertakings rose to Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 416,000),
and interest payable fell to Pounds 3m (Pounds 4.5m).

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: The Telegraph recommends purchase of
Southam stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TELEGRAPH, the newspaper group 68 per cent-owned by Mr Conrad Black's
Hollinger Group, has written to shareholders giving details of the proposed
Pounds 72.3m purchase of a stake in Southam, the heavily-indebted and
loss-making Canadian newspaper group, from Hollinger.
The deal is subject to approval of shareholders other than Hollinger, a
Canadian holding company, at a special meeting on March 30. The shares fell
3p to 330p.
The Telegraph's independent directors, advised by NM Rothschild, the
merchant bank which handled The Telegraph's flotation last summer, are
recommending the deal. Shareholders with 8.3 per cent of the group's equity,
more than a quarter of the non-Hollinger shares, have agreed to vote in
favour.
In the circular shareholders were told that the deal would dilute earnings
in the short term, although not significantly, and that The Telegraph would
not receive dividends from its investment 'until towards the end of 1994'.
It expects to equity account the stake, which will be held through a joint
company owned 50:50 with Hollinger.
The independent directors said that the investment in Southam represented 'a
unique opportunity'. Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph, said
it would be able to influence Southam through three directors nominated by
Hollinger and The Telegraph.
He said Southam would benefit from recovery in the Canadian economy, from
improving its marketing and cutting overmanning - with advice from The
Telegraph - and could sell its non-newspaper divisions.
Hollinger agreed to buy the 22.5 per cent stake in Southam on November 8
last year at a cost of CDollars 258.6m (Pounds 145.2m), or CDollars 18.10
per share, a 15 per cent premium to the then market price. The deal was
completed on January 8. The Telegraph will buy half that stake paying the
same price as Hollinger did, although the Southam share price has since
fallen to CDollars 13.50.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wiltshire cuts loss to Pounds 979,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wiltshire Brewery, the USM-traded brewer and distributor in which the UB
Group of India late last year gained management control, yesterday reported
a reduced annual deficit.
On turnover at Pounds 2.47m for the the 12 months to November 30 (Pounds
2.5m for 14 months), losses before tax were Pounds 979,000 (Pounds 1.39m),
struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 297,000 (Pounds 460,000). Losses
per share were 8.58p (15.93p).
At the operating level, however, the company returned to the black with
profits of Pounds 38,000 (losses of Pounds 207,000).
The figures did not reflect December's Pounds 6.9m refinancing and purchase
of 37 pubs. Mr Vijay Mallya, chairman, said that gearing had dropped from
354 per cent to 102 per cent on a pro-forma basis.
Mr Mallya attributed the improvement at the operating level to the
conversion of loss-making houses into tenancies, thereby reducing overheads
and generating rental income. Some 83 per cent of the estate is now
tenanted. However, the company still has a bad debt problem.
The company plans to change its name to United Breweries.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Watmoughs rises 51% to Pounds 12m and wins
magazine contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATMOUGHS (Holdings), the Bradford-based printer, yesterday announced a 51
per cent increase in 1992 full year profits and said it detected a 'slight
improvement' in the UK newspaper colour supplement and magazine markets.
At the same time Mr Patrick Walker, chief executive, revealed that the group
had won the contract to print the News of the World's Sunday colour
supplement, Britain's biggest circulation magazine with a weekly print run
of 5.2m copies.
Mr Walker said News International had signed a letter of intent for the
group to begin printing the supplement in April next year, when the present
contract with a German printer expires.
Watmoughs has yet to decide on whether to buy a new press to service the
contract.
Pre-tax profits for 1992 increased to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 8.1m) on turnover
which rose to Pounds 118.9m (Pounds 107.4m) despite difficult trading
conditions, industry excess capacity and pressure on margins.
After adjusting for the Pounds 22.3m rights issue early last year, earnings
increased to 26p (20.6p). A recommended final dividend of 8.8p makes an
11.5p (10.5p) total.
The profit improvement reflected the recovery from a temporary downturn
experienced in the 1991 second quarter, coupled with lower interest charges
of Pounds 456,000 (Pounds 2.54m) following the receipt of the proceeds of
the rights issue and lower interest rates.
Mr Walker said the group had managed to increase its share of the market for
high quality long run colour supplements, magazines, mail order catalogues
and retail brochures.
Export sales from the UK continued to grow reaching Pounds 5.86m (Pounds
3.75m) last year. Supported by its strong cash flow the group has been
investing heavily in new technology and expanding its presence in
continental Europe.
Capital expenditure last year totalled Pounds 59.3m including a substantial
investment on new presses in the UK and Pounds 31.6m on the group's new
gravure plant in Madrid which begins printing next month.
The group ended the year with net borrowings of Pounds 26m and gearing of 29
per cent (30 per cent).
COMMENT
Watmoughs has been investing heavily in its future. In the three years to
December 1993 it will have spent Pounds 58m on capital investment in the UK
and Pounds 46m in Spain and Hungary. The Madrid plant will begin with three
titles, the group's recently acquired Hungarian subsidiary, Revai,is already
contributing profits and, helped by a weak pound, the group is winning
business back from the Continent. Meanwhile in the UK it has won new orders
for substantial retail catalogues and says it detects a upturn in the
newspaper supplement and magazine markets. But even without a recovery,
profits should grow to about Pounds 14.2m this year producing earnings of
some 30p per share. The stock has been climbing since last summer and, after
gaining another 15p to reach a new high of 620p yesterday, is trading on a
lofty prospective p/e of 20.7.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: DAP gives lift to Wassall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, reported a
73 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 after a
first full 12 month contribution from DAP, a US supplier of DIY products.
Profits rose from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 17.8m on increased sales of Pounds
251.1m (Pounds 165.2m).
DAP, which was acquired in August 1991, contributed Pounds 8.9m to operating
profit of Pounds 20.6m. Margins increased from 5 to 8 per cent, just below
the group's average of 8.2.
The US company's diverse product range was rationalised, leading to the
elimination of 500 stock-keeping units, accounting for Dollars 10m (Pounds
7m) of sales. This was more than recouped by aggressive marketing of DAP's
more profitable products.
The number of plants is being slimmed down from 9 to 7, which Wassall
expects to lead to more opportunities to increase margins.
With the conglomerate's other businesses reporting a 17 per cent increase in
operating profits from Pounds 10m to Pounds 11.7m, Mr Chris Miller, chief
executive, believes he is under no pressure to make another takeover.
However, he said: 'People invest in us to do deals and we are already
looking at various opportunities.'
In the light of its failed bid for Evode, the chemicals and plastic group,
Mr Miller said: 'We have learnt the lessons that there will always be a big
risk of a white knight when targeting a good company.'
Laporte, the chemicals group, won the battle for Evode earlier this year,
easily outbidding Wassall with a recommended Pounds 129.4m bid. Wassall
covered the costs of its bid by selling its 3.5 per cent stake in Evode for
Pounds 1m.
Consumer products, which includes DAP, reported operating profits of Pounds
10.5m (Pounds 3.99m); Closures, the bottle top maker, made Pounds 9.3m
(Pounds 8m), and industrial and commercial activities turned in Pounds
900,000 (Pounds 800,000).
Earnings per share increased to 10p (8.7p). The final dividend rises to 1.7p
making an increased total of 2.5p (2p).
COMMENT
Good companies at rock-bottom prices are hard to find, which is why some
conglomerates may turn out to be bigger sellers than buyers this year. Not
so Wassall. After failing to win its hotly contested bid for Evode, it is
back on the takeover trail. The next target is more likely to be private
than publicly quoted. This is partly because Wassall does not want to find
itself in a bidding war and partly because private companies like doing
business with people who have cash. With interest rates at record lows on
both sides of the Atlantic there are not many arguments in favour of keeping
Pounds 31m in the bank. With forecast earnings of Pounds 25.5m the shares
are on a prospective multiple of 20.7. As long as it can find another
acquisition which can repeat DAP's success, its high rating continues to be
justified.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Abbott Mead slips 6% to Pounds 4.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBOTT MEAD VICKERS, the advertising group, yesterday exceeded analysts'
expectations by turning in pre-tax profits 6 per cent lower at Pounds 4.72m
for the year to December 31, on turnover up 5.6 per cent at Pounds 167.8m.
Operating profits were up by 5 per cent at Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 4.24m), and
a recommended final dividend of 6.3p makes a total of 9.3p (8.4p), payable
from earnings of 18.71p (22.09p) per share.
Operating margins were down slightly at 15.5 per cent (16.6 per cent). The
group ended the year with no debts, and net assets of Pounds 10.1m.
The advertising agencies within the group gained Pounds 50m in new business
through 1992, including significant accounts such as Seat, Adidas, Gillette
and Cellnet.
The group said that three small companies which the group started in 1992,
in sales promotions and investor relations, would be in profit this year,
and that its purchase of some of Clarke Hooper Communications - which went
into receivership in late 1992 - was already showing profits.
Staff levels reached 391 (352) last year, but income per employee levels
were almost stable, at Pounds 73,701 for 1992, against Pounds 74,691 in
1991.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Price rises in pipeline as Rugby edges up
to Pounds 57.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING MATERIAL price increases are starting to be forced through by
producers according to Rugby Group, which supplies cement, joinery, steel
and glass to the UK, European and US construction industries.
Rugby's share price rose by 6 per cent yesterday, from 222p to 236p, after
pre-tax profits edged ahead from Pounds 57.3m to Pounds 57.6m over 1992
despite deep recession in the UK construction industry.
Mr Peter Carr, managing director, said that there were clear indications
that material producers believed the time was right to try to recover lost
margins by pushing up prices.
Increases announced at the beginning of this year of up to 13 per cent by
British Steel and 8 per cent by Pilkington, the UK glass manufacturer, so
far had held firm, he said.
'The closure of large manufacturing capacity means that supply and demand is
coming back into line. With the prospect of revival in the housing market
there appears to be a concerted attempt among manufacturers to make price
rises stick.'
Foreign manufacturers suffering from sterling's devaluation were in no
position to undercut price moves by British companies. In the case of glass,
continental European manufacturers had followed Pilkington's lead and raised
their own prices by a similar amount according to Mr Carr.
He said that steel, glass, plasterboard, timber and other product price
price rises could increase UK building material bills by up to 6 per cent
this year. This could be damaging for contractors and sub-contractors which
had taken on fixed-price construction contracts at little or no profit
margin.
Rugby, Britain's third largest cement manufacturer with about 20 per cent of
the market, needs to buy steel, glass and timber for its constructional
steel, steel reinforcement and joinery businesses. Cement prices, unlike
those for other building materials, have seen small rises during recession
but have not been increased this year.
A 15 per cent fall in UK trading profits to Pounds 29.4m (Pounds 34.8m) was
offset by a 41 per cent increase in overseas profits from Pounds 16.6m to
Pounds 23.4m. International profits were helped by the devaluation of
sterling.
A 7 per cent increase in Australian dollar profits, for example, became a 20
per cent gain in sterling at year-end exchange rates.
UK cement profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 16.8m following a 5 per fall in
volume sales. Rugby said that it expected sales to decline by a similar
amount in the current year.
Interest received rose from Pounds 4.43m to Pounds 4.82m and helped maintain
earnings per share at 13.1p. An unchanged final dividend of 3.6p holds the
total for the year at 6.45p.
COMMENT
Currency translations had a mixed effect on Rugby's results, enhancing the
sterling profits of overseas operations but depressing by Pounds 17m the
value of cash reserves which during the year fell from Pounds 24m to Pounds
12m. Devaluation will reduce the amount of interest receivable in the
current year offsetting further trading improvements in Australia and the
US. As a result profits seem likely to show little change. Rugby is a well
managed group, with a strong balance sheet and adequate dividend cover,
which has shown itself capable of funding necessary capital expenditure out
of cashflow. A prospective p/e of 18 on maintained earnings, however,
suggests that these virtues have been recognised in the share price.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: IMI suffers 7% fall to Pounds 68m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMI, the international engineering group, held the decline in its profits
before tax for the 1992 year to 7 per cent.
The pre-tax outcome of Pounds 68m compared with Pounds 73.2m last time.
Earnings were 13.6p (15p) and the total dividend is maintained for the third
year running at 10p via a final of 5.8p.
The stock market viewed the figures benignly enough to push the shares up
11p to 270p, checking the decline of last week when the shares dipped some 6
per cent.
Turnover advanced from Pounds 968m to Pounds 1.01bn, producing operating
profits down on margin pressure to Pounds 75.6m (Pounds 78.1m). Interest
payments increased from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 8.4m, reflecting both an
increase in gearing over the year to 26 per cent (22 per cent) and, more
significantly, foreign exchange variations towards the end of the year.
The group is now nearing the end of recession-induced rationalisation.
'Major job losses: we think that is now behind us in 1992,' said Mr Gary
Allen, chief executive, noting that the net loss of jobs during 1992 was
1,100, taking the total payroll at the end of the year to 17,500.
'The high level of capital spending we have undertaken in recent years puts
us in a good position to recover quickly in any general upturn in activity,'
said Sir Eric Pountain, chairman.
In the last financial year, IMI spent Pounds 54m on fixed capital
investments and Pounds 20m on acquisitions. Over the three years of
recession its capital expenditure - Pounds 160m - has been running at 1.5
times the rate of depreciation and its acquisition spending has reached
Pounds 120m.
Of the main operating divisions, drinks dispense and fluid power were the
strongest, underpinning operating profits. Earnings were lower in the fluid
power and special engineering divisions, the last containing the troublesome
titanium operations which continued to lose money.
COMMENT
Given a flat UK economy, divining IMI's immediate future is the art of
balancing the brightening US economic prospect against the darkening
continental European market. The group has helped itself to the extent that
it has now, after heavy investment, sorted out its copper tube operations
and is gaining market share. Titanium should stop losing money this year as
the market firms, but fluid power remains a worry in Europe and the best
year for selling building products in Germany has passed. Small wonder it is
looking for expansion in the Far East. Still, drinks dispense looks strong
and recent capital investment will flow through to the bottom line this year
making 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 75m look feasible. That would produce
earnings per share of 15.5p, giving the shares a prospective p/e of 17.4,
high enough until the European clouds lighten.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Delta hit by US cable problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHDRAWAL from an Australian business and continuing problems in US cables
further undermined profitability at Delta, the electrical engineering group,
last year.
Pre-tax profit for 1992 fell 14 per cent to Pounds 55m (Pounds 64m) on
turnover of Pounds 785.9m (Pounds 774m). This followed about Pounds 3m of
rationalisation costs at Surprenant, a US cables company badly affected by
defence cuts, and a dent in profits of more than Pounds 6m in Australia.
Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said disposals and closures in Australia
accounted for 80 per cent of the Pounds 8.2m profit fall in the industrial
services division, which made Pounds 12.8m pre-interest on Pounds 160.1m
(Pounds 191m) sales.
Losses in North America were the main factor behind a 33 per cent decline in
profits in the cables division to Pounds 8.68m (Pounds 13.1m) on Pounds
263.8m (Pounds 279.4m) sales. The impact of severe competition in the UK was
offset by exports.
The biggest profit earner was the engineering division, including plumbing
products and control equipment. It rose to a record Pounds 22.2m (Pounds
21.3m) on Pounds 320.1m (Pounds 295.1m) turnover, thanks to continuing
growth in continental Europe. However, continental demand slowed in the
second half.
In circuit protection, profit recovered to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 13.6m) on
Pounds 132.7m (Pounds 110.8m) sales. New products, particularly a circuit
breaker for industrial use, had improved market share.
The results included a Pounds 1.69m profit on a business disposal and a
Pounds 2.71m currency gain on an investment related to an aborted US
acquisition. Mr Easton said Delta backed out of the purchase, worth about
Dollars 200m (Pounds 140m), because of a last-minute problem arising from
the due diligence exercise.
It would have been debt financed, taking gearing to between 50 per cent and
60 per cent, as the group retains its aversion to equity issues.
Year-end gearing rose from 13 per cent to 18 per cent, on net assets of
Pounds 322.2m. The main purchase was the outstanding 36 per cent stake in
Delta Crompton Cable for Pounds 37m from BTR.
Earnings per share slipped from 27p to 23p. The proposed final dividend is
held at 9.8p to give an unchanged total of 14p.
COMMENT
Delta faces another year of swings and roundabouts as recession in
continental markets is expected to halt the record run in engineering and
offset any gains from recovery in the UK and US. The pound's devaluation
should help exports from the UK as well as providing gains in translation
this year. Restructuring costs should also be lower this year. The balance
sheet is comfortable and an acquisition would certainly liven up views on
the company, which has come to be seen as solid and unexciting. A pre-tax
profit forecast of Pounds 57m gives a prospective p/e of nearly 18 times
after yesterday's 9p rise in the share price to 444p. This looks about
right, bearing in mind the continental impediment to a proper recovery in
group profits.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help boost BPP to Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DROP in spending on language training by large international companies
restricted growth in 1992 at BPP Holdings, the education and training group.
However, pre-tax profits still increased from Pounds 6.39m to Pounds 7.08m
thanks to a full-year contribution from acquisitions during 1991. Sales rose
from Pounds 42.4m to Pounds 48.7m.
Linguarama, the language training subsidiary, encountered increasingly
difficult trading conditions. An exceptional charge of Pounds 650,000
covered redundancies and the closure of language schools in Japan and
France.
Mr Richard Price, chairman, said this reorganisation would result in a more
competitive business comprising 34 schools in 10 countries, although trading
was likely to remain difficult in Japan and continental Europe.
Operating profits from language training were Pounds 857,000 (Pounds 1.16m)
on turnover of Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 18.3m). A breakdown of profits and
turnover showed publishing at Pounds 3.29m (Pounds 1.95m) on Pounds 14.3m
(Pounds 9.53m), professional training at Pounds 2.47m (Pounds 1.88m) on
Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 10.1m) and academic education at Pounds 306,000 (Pounds
484,000) on Pounds 4.36m (Pounds 4.42m).
Net cash at the year-end was Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 6.7m). In spite of
considering a number of candidates, BPP made no acquisitions in 1992.
Earnings per share fell from 17.3p to 16p, thanks mainly to an increased tax
charge of Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 2.09m). The group said that given the
cash-generative quality of the business, it had decided to increase the
final dividend to 5.3p, giving a total for the year of 8p (6.9p).

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Amersham expands in the US via Dollars 69m
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERSHAM International, the UK health science group, is to acquire United
States Biochemical, a privately-owned supplier of reagents to the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, for up to Dollars 69m (Pounds
48m) in shares and cash.
Amersham will pay Dollars 52m immediately to the group of investors headed
by Mr Thomas Mann who are selling USB. Further payments up to Dollars 17m
will follow over the next three years, depending on sales of USB products.
USB - founded 20 years ago in Cleveland - is known particularly for making
enzymes that genetic researchers use to determine DNA sequences. It is
expected to make pre-tax profits of Dollars 3.6m in the year to April 30, on
sales of Dollars 36m.
'This represents a strategic step forward for our life science business,'
said Mr Bill Castell, Amersham chief executive. 'Joining with USB will give
us a leading position in both radioactive and non-radioactive sequencing and
will provide critical mass in the vital American marketplace.'
In 1990 Amersham bought the US-based Medi-Physics business for Dollars 46m
and sold its clinical reagents business to Kodak for Pounds 84m.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Waiting for the griffin to pull its weight: HSBC's results
since acquiring Midland Bank last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sculpture of two intertwined brass coils rising from a solid base sits in
Midland Bank's head office in London. Called 'Union', it was given by Sir
William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, after it acquired Midland last
July. 'They're obviously going to screw us into the ground,' said one
Midland director on seeing it.
As HSBC yesterday announced the first results for the new bank, the mood was
less nervous. The first months of a merger that created the world's 15th
largest bank have demonstrated some of its benefits. An example is the
mixture of four styles of signs in Midland branches. The backing of capital
from HSBC, parent of Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, has allowed
it to spend Pounds 18m this year unifying the style.
Even such small amounts were hard to spare at Midland in the late 1980s.
Still stricken by its 1981 purchase of Crocker National Bank in California,
Midland incurred a Pounds 261m pre-tax loss in 1989 and only made Pounds 11m
the next year. 'None of what we're doing now costs a lot a money, but we did
not have any before,' says Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive.
The prospect of HSBC dominating Midland has been lessened by the mixing of
executives. Mr Richard Delbridge, Midland's finance director, has become
HSBC group finance director. Mr Pearse professes to be content. 'I have
found my masters very receptive. I'd be very surprised if they went against
anything I thought was right.'
Mr John Bond, HSBC's group chief executive, says Midland will maintain its
style. 'We do not go around the world trying to export our culture. We have
a few central principles, but each bank has its way of doing things,' he
says. He lists the principles as strong capital and liquidity, a stress on
information technology, and rigorous control of costs.
Yet the continuation of such harmony depends on Midland performing a lot
better than in the past. It now makes up 40 per cent of HSBC's assets, but
contributed only Pounds 184m to the group's Pounds 1.2bn attributable
profit. The Hong Kong shareholders who needed persuading last year that
Midland was worth Pounds 4bn will watch for an improvement.
The imbalance between HSBC's Asia Pacific operations and Midland is
striking. Mr Robert Law, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, estimates that
HSBC's Asian operations earned a 50 per cent pre-tax return on capital last
year. Midland would need to make Pounds 800m even to achieve 20 per cent,
which is well above its highest ever pre-tax profit of Pounds 693m in 1988.
It has moved to remove overlap, spending Pounds 122m on restructuring in the
second half of 1992. The London-based treasury and capital markets
operations have been merged and moved to a new building.
Cost savings and the increased size have produced benefits: the combined
treasury operation costs 20 per cent less, and has raised turnover 17 per
cent. Mr Pearse says corporate customers are now attracted to the merged
Midland/HSBC because of its size, its greater capital strength and its
resources in operations such as trade finance.
Outside large corporate business, the merger remains unproven. HSBC's
hardest task is to improve profits in the personal and small corporate
business carried out through branches. Unlike Lloyds Bank, which made a
counter-bid for Midland before withdrawing, HSBC cannot reap cost savings
through eliminating overlap in branch networks.
HSBC's most likely edge over other clearing banks is in technology. UK banks
have allowed operations to develop incompatible systems: Midland's treasury
operations alone had 22 systems.
The bank has also used 'front office' technology for such things as credit
scoring more extensively than British UK banks. Loans to small businesses
are cleared by local managers within Midland; at Marine Midland such loans
are assessed at a lending centre in New York state.
How Midland will be affected by HSBC's preference for using technology to
automate credit decisions while controlling staff costs is unknown. Midland
cost-to-income ratio is 68.6 per cent compared with 56.6 per cent for HSBC
as a whole. But Mr Pearse says the network of 1,800 branches is the right
size, and the primary task is to pass more income through it.
The suggestion that costs could be saved by automating small business
lending gets a sceptical response from Mr Pearse.
'It may be a sign of my old age, but I would have to be convinced about
that. I still believe that the capital structure of most small businesses in
this country mean you have to be involved face-to-face with them,' he says.
Mr Bond puts a different stress on the balance of cost and income, given
sluggish loan demand in recession-hit OECD countries.
'The only thing you really have under your control at the moment is costs,'
he says. He emphasises HSBC's preference for 'very short lines of
communication', without thick layers of head office middle management.
For the moment, the different traditions are a matter for debate rather than
argument. Mr Bond is still assessing the acquisition after coming to London
in January, and Mr Purves does not arrive until the autumn.
But Mr Pearse's approach will soon have to bear fruit in transformed
profits; HSBC's patience may otherwise wear uncomfortably thin.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Barings chairman quits after policy dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Christopher Heath, the man who built Baring Securities into one of the
UK's most successful securities houses in the late 1980s, yesterday resigned
along with a large part of his senior management team after a policy dispute
over the company's future.
Mr Heath and his team are believed to have pushed for Barings to expand its
securities and derivatives business in a move that could have led the group
to sell a stake to another bank.
Mr Andrew Tuckey, deputy chairman, said no specific proposals had been put
to the board, but added that 'none of these initiatives have any appeal to
us, because we have neither the capital nor the inclination' to expand the
business.
The move comes six months after Barings, one of the UK's oldest merchant
banking groups, announced that its securities arm had plunged into loss in
the first half of 1992, cutting group profits by more than a half to Pounds
11.8m. More than 100 jobs were shed at that stage, and yesterday's
departures raised the prospect of further cuts in the securities arm and its
80-strong derivatives unit.
Mr Tuckey said the parting had been amicable and that Mr Heath, the
company's chairman and once the UK's highest-paid director, would remain as
a consultant to the group.
Others directors to depart were Mr Ian Martin, head of derivatives, and Mr
Andrew Baylis, head of European operations, while Mr Jim Reed, head of New
York, and Ms Vanessa Gibson have also left the Barings Securities Board.
One of the executives who stepped down said that discussions over the future
of the company had come to a head last weekend: 'One route would have been
more exciting and expansionist - and, yes, might have required more capital
and an extra partner. The other was more consolidating. At the end of the
day, it's very difficult to back something you don't agree with.'
Two other directors, Mr Andrew Fraser and Mr Diarmaid Kelly, have been made
deputy chairmen. Mr Peter Norris, put in by Barings as chief operating
officer last autumn, takes over as chief executive.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Government admits defeat over contracting-out case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has conceded defeat in a court case over the contracting out
of public services after legal advice that EC employment legislation which
protects the jobs, terms and conditions of staff transferred to the private
sector applies more widely than previously thought.
The decision comes after a union campaign against contracting out of public
services which has in the past led to job cuts and inferior employment
terms.
The decision to concede defeat has angered contractors which believe that
the government will find further progress on contracting out stalled.
'The government has effectively thrown in the towel,' said Mr Cliff
Davis-Coleman of Clause 26, a contractors' pressure group.
Mr Davis-Coleman said this could mean that Tupe, the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981, the legislation
which implements EC laws in the UK, will be applied to all public-sector
contracts. 'It makes a nonsense of the government's entire market-testing
and privatisation programme,' he added.
Ministers believe the decision could make it harder for existing staff to
bid for their work in future programmes of contracting-out. If the jobs, pay
and conditions of staff are protected, there would be no need to invite an
in-house bid from the staff.
The court case was over a decision by South Glamorgan health authority to
contract out the canteens of three hospitals in Cardiff. The health service
union Cohse applied for a judicial review over the failure of the authority
to apply Tupe.
Due to be heard next week, the case has been halted on the instructions of
the Welsh Office, after legal advice that the Tupe regulations applied to
the contract. Government lawyers are negotiating with Cohse over costs and
other details.
Ministers accept most contracting out of public services will be covered by
the legislation after attempts to have the EC exclude contracting out
foundered.
Mr Padraig Flynn, EC commissioner for social affairs, said on BBC-TV's On
The Record there was no wish to amend the Acquired Rights Directive: 'It
must be remembered that we are concerned about the protection of workers and
their rights.'
Confusion over the scope of the legislation has delayed the government's
market-testing programme under which almost Pounds 1.5bn of Civil Service
work has been put out to tender.
Notices of dismissal to 180 employees of the computing and financial
services arm of four London boroughs were rescinded yesterday after the
company accepted that the Tupe regulations applied.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Yeltsin fears communist revival: President's aides signal
plan for plebiscite under international supervision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday accused his parliamentary
opponents of seeking to restore communist rule. His aides signalled that he
planned to secure popular support in a plebiscite under international
supervision.
In a statement issued by Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, his press secretary, Mr
Yeltsin accused the Congress of Peoples' Deputies of denying the people the
right to a referendum and of 'violating the constitution'. Its decisions
during last week's four-day session were 'an attempt to . . . return the
levers of government to the communist nomenklatura'.
Mr Yeltsin would give his response in the next few days, Mr Kostikov said,
adding in a later interview: 'I think that Boris Nikolayevich (the
president) intends to act as decisively as he showed himself capable of
doing in the fatal days of August 1991' - a reference to the failed
communist putsch against president Mikhail Gorbachev.
The latest clashes between the president and his hardline opponents in
parliament came as western leaders repeated their support for Mr Yeltsin.
German chancellor Helmut Kohl warned that not only Mr Yeltsin's domestic
reforms but also the entire process of peaceful international co-operation
was threatened by the political backlash in Moscow.
A similar message is expected to be delivered by French president Francois
Mitterrand when he arrives in Moscow on an official visit today.
The expressions of international concern follow a weekend meeting of
officials from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations in Hong
Kong. However, beyond considering more effective ways of targeting their aid
for Russia, there is little sign that western governments are any closer to
agreeing increased financial assistance.
Mr Yeltsin's tactic now appears to consist of proceeding to a plebiscite on
who governs the country. Mr Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister and now
chief economic adviser to the president, said yesterday that Mr Yeltsin
could constitutionally hold a plebiscite under the existing law on
referendums.
Mr Gaidar said 'probably it would be a good idea to hold such a plebiscite
involving international observers.'
Mr Yeltsin's opponents, by contrast, insist that Congress is the
constitutional authority. Mr Konstantin Zlobin, the spokesman for the
Russian parliament, yesterday rejected the president's allegations and said
that the 'democratic gains' made by the Congress last week 'significantly
reduce the possibilities of legal cover for the destructive activities' of
Mr Yeltsin's advisers.
To broaden his political support ahead of a plebiscite, Mr Yeltsin may also
consider appointing some centrist figures to his cabinet, according to Mr
Gaidar.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Amato says Italy faces north-south break-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GIULIANO AMATO, the Italian prime minister, yesterday said his country
faced the risk of a break-up between north and south unless it made urgent
changes to its electoral laws.
Mr Amato coupled his warning of possible secession with a strong call for
the establishment of a new political class to steer the country out of its
crisis over corruption.
Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Amato said revelations of
widespread illicit financing in business and politics gave Italy no choice
but to 'renew its ruling class'.
If elections were held now under the proportional electoral system,
dissatisfaction with established parties would lead to 'the inevitable
success of extremist parties'.
The right wing Lombard League, which favours detaching the prosperous north
from the poor south, would probably be the strongest party in parliament, Mr
Amato said.
'If we can change the system towards the smallest amount of proportional
representation that Italians are capable of introducing, then the danger (of
fragmentation) would be smaller,' Mr Amato said.
Italians vote in a national referendum on April 18 on a series of
constitutional issues, including reforming the electoral system. The outcome
is expected to increase pressure for an early general election.
Mr Amato, who has already announced his prospective retirement from
politics, spelt out his vision of a 'peaceful revolution' throughout Italy's
ruling elite.
His eight-month-old coalition has been at the centre of the political storm.
Several ministers have been among more than 1,000 politicians, businessmen
and officials implicated in the scandals.
As the scale of corruption unearthed during the last few weeks has
increased, expectations of the future make-up of the Italian political
system had 'changed totally', Mr Amato said.
The aim in coming months was to 'get new people out of the professions -
ordinary citizens - into parliament, because the old people will not be
acceptable any more,' he said.
Speaking of the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties at the centre of
scandals, Mr Amato said: 'I don't expect these parties to be players in the
new game. I don't expect these men (the parties' present leaders) to be
leading figures in the new system.'
Mr Renato Altissimo, leader of the small Liberal party, yesterday became the
third head of an Italian political party to be caught up in the net of
investigations.
Magistrates said he had been told he was under investigation for alleged
corruption.
He was one of at least seven new parliamentarians served with such notices
yesterday.

<TEXT>
BA is delighted that the first Dollars 300m stage of its investment in USAir
has been temporarily approved. In truth, the US transportation secretary had
no alternative under existing aviation agreements. The crucial question is:
what follows?
Mr Federico Pena will press hard for a revised bilateral aviation agreement
with the UK government giving US carriers greater access to the European
market. BA will then face a tricky calculation whether to cede some Heathrow
slots in the hope of receiving US regulatory approval for the next two
phases of its link up with USAir. These stages would bring the real
operational rewards.
But such considerations may be academic. In its current mood, the US
Congress would bristle at approving any agreement allowing BA fuller access
to the domestic market no matter what Mr Pena may agree.

FT  16 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: English China Clays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having abandoned its adventure in housebuilding, English China Clays now
finds itself becalmed. Selling kaolin to paper makers will remain
unrewarding until demand for the end product catches up with capacity. Given
the cyclical downturn in Europe, that point may not be reached until well
into 1994. Meanwhile, ECC is in no position to reverse the downward pressure
on margins. The move into Pacific markets and an upswing in the US should
offset the worst of the damage. The 1990 acquisition of Georgia Kaolin now
looks well-timed. But without further steps in that direction, the growth
prospects are far from obvious.
ECC could usefully raise as much as Pounds 150m by disposals from its land
bank and redeploy the funds where growth prospects are better. Given the
groggy UK housing market, though, it would not do to count on an early
realisation. A debt-funded acquisition would be another way forward. Having
replaced most of its auction-market preference shares with last year's
rights issue, ECC's balance sheet is strong. The worry is that higher
interest charges would eat into free cash flow. That might undermine the
secure 5.8 per cent yield on which the shares now depend.

FT  16 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between Airtours and Owners has become an unedifying dogfight.
Thomas Cook's last-minute move to buy 8.4 per cent of Owners' shares in the
market at 152 1/2 p apiece may have tilted the balance in the defence's
favour. If so, Cook could then proceed with its tender offer for a further
12.5 per cent of Owners' shares at 150p enabling the two parties to
consummate their strategic alliance.
This may serve Cook's interests well. It is not clear if it is as good for
all Owners' shareholders. The guiding principle of the Takeover Code
suggests that an offeror should treat all the offeree's shareholders
equally. Cook has not made a bid and therefore has no such obligation.
Nevertheless, it has cynically tried to curb Owners' shareholders' freedom
of choice. Although not prepared to bid, Cook is prepared to scupper a rival
offer by dislodging some loose institutional holders of Owners' shares. It
would then be able to deter further bids with its large blocking stake.
Wavering shareholders should reject such tactics. The Airtours' offer still
looks the best alternative.
Sadly, this tale confirms how some bids have degenerated into back-room
deals between companies and fund managers. Small shareholders might be
forgiven for feeling cheated.

<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings is clearly pleased with the diversification represented by
last year's acquisition of Midland Bank. But the 68 per cent increase to
Pounds 1.01bn in the Hongkong Bank's attributable profits shows where the
group's most dynamic growth still lies. Even without the currency conversion
factor and the Pounds 270m gain from the sale of the Cathay Pacific stake,
income in the Asia-Pacific region continues strong. Midland is unlikely ever
to match the Hongkong Bank's astonishing return on average shareholders'
funds of over 30 per cent.
The danger remains of over-estimating the bank's resilience if the Asian
boom falters. At some stage, though probably not before 1994, rising US
interest rates and narrower margins on Hong Kong business could produce a
noticeable dent, especially if the political situation remains tense.
Midland's profits should rise as provisions fall. HSBC's computer systems
could bring remarkable efficiency gains, but they will take years to flow
through and the bulk of the cost-cutting in Midland is complete.
HSBC may thus not yet have found the complete answer to its diversification
dilemma. It is still heavily dependent on its volatile traditional market.
The eventual answer might yet be to float all or part of the Hong Kong
operation locally. The bank says nothing could be further from its mind when
it is making so much money there. Indeed, but the chance could vanish for
good if political trouble really strikes.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Prepared for a purge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French opposition leaders will be tempted to celebrate their likely election
victory at the end of this month by purging state industry of the company
chairmen most loyal to the Socialists.
It might seem curious that this is possible in a modern and competitive
European economy, yet there is pressure on both sides of the right-wing
RPR-UDF alliance to put supporters of the new government at the head of
state companies before they are privatised.
There is also the urge for revenge. The conservatives have not forgotten the
wholesale management changes staged by the Socialists during the
nationalisations after their 1981 election victory. Heads have rolled,
though not so many, after each change of power since then.
The prospect is said to have brought decision-making in some state groups to
a near halt, for fear that a new chairman might follow a different strategy.
Foreign partners are worried, notably Volvo, which is keeping its fingers
crossed that there will no change in the management of Renault, the
government-owned carmaker in which it holds a 20 per cent stake.
Mr Edouard Balladur, tipped as a leading prime ministerial candidate for the
conservative RPR, has told his team that he does not want a witch-hunt. He
is sensitive to the fact that French state industry's foreign competitors
suffer no such political risk.
Whether moderates like him get their way depends on the election results.
Even though the outcome is not clear, the vulnerable company chiefs are:
Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf Aquitaine, the oil group which is
France's largest company in terms of turnover.
The right is thought unlikely to want to leave a close friend of President
Francois Mitterrand in charge of this strategically important company. The
previous conservative government kicked Mr Le Floch- Prigent out of his last
state industry job, as chairman of Rhone-Poulenc in 1986 and might drop him
again, to the applause of his enemies at the influential Treasury, but
possibly to the alarm of his private sector shareholders.
Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's largest
banks.
He is blamed for the bank's high-risk expansion and its exposure to
embarrassing problems such as Hollywood's MGM studios, which have frustrated
right-wing hopes of a quick privatisation for Credit Lyonnais. Mr Haberer's
close links with Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, count against him,
though he also has highly placed friends on the right.
Mr Rene Thomas, chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris.
His management is respected, but Mr Thomas, 64, is due to retire at the end
of the year, offering the right a convenient opportunity to hand this
important job to a supporter.
Shadows are hanging over the futures of Mr Gilles Menage, a former chief of
staff to Mr Mitterrand, who now runs Electricite de France, and over Mr Jean
Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP, the biggest state insurer.
Also at risk are Mr Alain Gomez, the Socialist appointee who has run
Thomson, the troubled electronics group for the past 11 years, making him
the longest-surviving chairman of a state-owned group, and Mr Yves
Lyon-Caen, chairman of the Credit National bank and a close colleague of
former Socialist prime minister Mr Michel Rocard.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Leading Article: German pain postponed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH BROAD smiles and much fraternal back-slapping, Germany's political
establishment has demonstrated that its famed consensual model lives on.
Many observers feared that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's solidarity talks were an
excuse for inaction in addressing Germany's mounting fiscal problems. But
this weekend's package confounds them by raising income tax 7.5 per cent,
through a reintroduced solidarity surcharge from January 1 1995, and by
increasing public borrowing for east Germany by some DM60bn. Yet these
actions do not solve Germany's problem. For while the agreement brings some
clarity to the fiscal muddle, it does so mainly by illuminating the fact
that Germany's structural budget deficit is here to stay.
The solidarity pact must be judged first in political terms. The minds of
both main political parties have been concentrated by the large falls in
their combined vote in the recent Hesse municipal elections. On these terms,
the cross-party deal, finalised in 2 1/2 days of fraught negotiations, was
an admirable success. Mutual compromises have enabled the government to
squeeze from western Germany's federal and state budgets the extra DM110bn
it needed to finance transfers to the eastern states in 1995. It also
rebalances the division of tax revenues between the federal and lander
governments.
Economic fudge
Yet it is unlikely that the Bundesbank's medium-term fiscal fears will be
allayed by Mr Kohl's agreement, even if the bank is convinced that falling
output and moderating western wage demands justify faster rate cuts now and
is therefore prepared to bow to increased political pressure to accelerate
the slow easing of short-term interest rates that has been under way since
last September. Good politics the pact may be, but in economic terms it
bears all the hallmarks of an unsatisfactory and misconceived fudge.
Judged as a solution to the problem of sharing the burden of transfers to
the east, it is unbalanced, vague and almost certainly insufficient. Almost
all of the extra financing will come from higher taxes and increased
borrowing, while Germany's fat welfare budget will remain untouched. Half of
the modest DM9.2bn in spending cuts comes from concealed tax increases
achieved by cutting tax allowances; another DM1.8bn is dubiously expected to
come from reduced welfare fraud; and at least DM1bn in spending cuts will
come from sources as yet unspecified.
The package is expected to reduce the federal budget deficit to DM63.8bn in
1995, DM7.8bn higher than previously forecast. But the projections are based
on the overly optimistic assumption that output will grow by 3 per cent in
both 1994 and 1995, despite the higher taxes and long-term interest rates
that the package is likely to inflict on west German industry. If the
economy recovers at a more realistic 2 per cent a year, then the total 1995
deficit, forecast at 4 1/2 per cent of GDP, looks decidedly structural.
Deeper problem
The structural deficit is evidence of a deeper problem. Domestic demand in
the east now exceeds eastern production by 87 per cent. But rather than
trying to close that gap, the pact merely finds a less-than-satisfactory
means of financing it. Productivity in east German manufacturing industry is
70 per cent below that in west Germany and engineering wages already stand
at 70 per cent of those in the west. But rather than trying to close the gap
between eastern wage costs and productivity, the pact merely finds ways to
continue subsidising east Germany's 'core' but unprofitable industries.
The sad fact is that German-style consensus, while adept at tinkering with
the symptoms, is still failing to solve the underlying problem that is
undermining the east German economy - the rapid pace of convergence of wages
between the eastern and western lander. And while the government celebrates
its success, IG Metall, the engineering union, continues to plan a series of
strikes next month in support of a 26 per cent pay rise for those of its
eastern members who still have a job. Unless this process is arrested, and
the threatened strikes are averted, then Germany's solidarity pact could
quickly unravel.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Leading Article: How not to run the BBC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK, the governors of the BBC meet in an atmosphere of crisis.
Following revelations about the unseemly pay contract of the corporation's
director-general, there are widespread calls for resignations and
dismissals. The board is badly split.
Deja vu. In 1987, one director-general was dismissed in controversial
circumstances. Four years later, a second's desire for a further term of
office divided the board and resulted in a two-year fudge in which the BBC
was hobbled with a director-general and a director-general-in-waiting, Mr
John Birt. It is now Mr Birt's future which sets governor against governor.
Given that the single most important managerial task of the governors is to
select and then monitor the progress of the director-general, such an
accident-prone system cannot be said to be working well.
The problem is that the governors do not know what they are there for. A
miscellany of academics, artists, Whitehall types and business executives,
the law says they are responsible for ensuring that parliament's wishes,
enshrined in the corporation's constitution, are fulfilled. In its clearest
sense, their mission is to regulate, standing between politicians and
broadcasters. In practice, governors make their influence felt by
controlling the most senior appointments and discussing any issue which
takes their fancy.
Blurred boundaries
This has meant that the governors do not do much well. Their ability to
supervise standards of taste has been judged so defective that other bodies
have entered the vacuum. Individual governors openly differ on whether they
should exercise the right to view programmes before transmission.
On the managerial front, they have tried to work more closely with
management, holding more joint meetings. It is not surprising that in this
atmosphere of blurred boundaries, nobody has been precise about who should
do what. Do all top appointments have to be by open competition? Some think
so, but many have not been. Who determines the terms and conditions of
senior managers? The whole board? A remuneration sub-committee? Whoever the
chairman happens to invite in for a drink?
It is against this background that the affair of Mr Birt's contract must be
judged. That he made a serious misjudgment in believing he could be the
corporation's first freelance director-general is beyond doubt. To the
ordinary citizen, these accountancy fictions, with their unidentified
secretaries and glamorous-sounding expense accounts, are a fiddle.
Not indispensable
The mitigating circumstances are that his tax arrangements were legal,
approved by the Inland Revenue and accepted by his employer. Mr Birt has
apologised, put his arrangements in order and should now be allowed to get
on with the job. He is not indispensable to the future of the BBC, but it is
primarily his vision which informs the case the BBC has made for a new royal
charter. Most who wish to see him ousted would prefer a more comfortable
notion of the BBC's future, but this is fantasy. The real question about Mr
Birt's vision is whether it is radical enough.
The other reputation on the line is that of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of
the board of governors. Mr Hussey's achievement has been to find Mr Birt and
to back him, against much mutiny, in the pursuit of a more efficient and
accountable BBC. He has helped put the BBC in a stronger political position
than it has enjoyed for decades.
But Mr Hussey is a schemer, a Fleet Street alley cat. He has alternately
charmed, bullied and excluded governors unsympathetic to his purpose. This
is not a style appropriate to the reformed mode of governance the BBC itself
envisaged in its recent response to the government's green paper. That
document calls for less meddling, clear structures, defined reporting lines,
consistently monitored standards and effective mechanisms for complaint.
Mr Hussey has performed a public service in kicking the BBC towards a more
realistic view of its future. The government should now ask him to prepare,
in an orderly fashion, to hand over to a successor.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Assault on the state's frontiers: The privatisation of
French industry will accelerate sharply if, as expected, the conservative
parties form the next government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French state's industrial frontiers have slowly, sometimes painfully,
receded over the past decade as economic deregulation has started to take
root in what has long been one of Europe's most interventionist countries.
The conservative team expected to succeed the Socialist government after the
general election at the end of this month is preparing to surrender yet more
of the state's role as a manager and owner of industry. Just how far the
alliance of the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF is prepared to let go will
set the tone for French industry pol-icy for the life of the next
government.
Conservative advisers are putting the finishing touches to an ambitious
privatisation programme to raise up to FFr200bn (Pounds 25.1bn) over four to
five years according to the most optimistic opposition plans. It will mark a
sharp acceleration of the partial privatisations under the Socialists, worth
FFr16bn last year, and aims to complete the privatisations started by the
conservatives during their last government from 1986 to 1988, when FFr120bn
worth of state companies were sold.
All state-owned banks, insurers and industrial companies will be on the
block, promises the opposition. The candidates for the first round of sales
include Elf Aquitaine, the oil group; Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company;
and Banque Nationale de Paris, the second-largest state-owned bank. All
three of these groups are already partly privatised and performing well. One
of the three big state insurers, UAP, AGF or GAN, is also expected in the
initial batch of sales.
The government will choose the rest of the disposals from the uncompleted
privatisations on its 1986 hit list of 65 companies, of which 29 were sold.
The list includes stars such as Pechiney in aluminium and packaging, which
is already quoted on the stock market. But there are already some industrial
headaches like Bull, the loss-making computer group which last week
announced a FFr4.7bn loss for 1992, and Thomson, the struggling electronics
company.
There will also, say opposition advisers, be one important new candidate not
on the 1986 list: Renault, the carmaker, which three years ago started on
the road to privatisation by exchanging minority stakes with Volvo, the
Swedish automotive group. The privatisation of Renault would be an important
step in the decline of interventionism because the group has been used as a
crucible of industrial and social policy experiments by successive postwar
governments.
'We have no doubt that Renault will come on to the market, perhaps after the
first wave of new privatisations. It is highly symbolic and also happens to
be one of the state's best assets,' says Mr Willy Douin, president of CS
First Boston France, the Paris branch of the Swiss merchant bank.
The actual candidates will be published in a privatisation law, to be
presented to the national assembly in the spring. Partial privatisations of
state utilities such as France Telecom and Electricite de France are also
under study, although these are thought to be a few years off.
The threat of recession facing the French economy means this round of
privatisations will be more difficult at first than the last round of
wholesale sell-offs. This took place over an economically euphoric 14
months, ended by the 1987 stock market crash and the conservatives'
political defeat.
Yet the signs are that the new sell-off candidates could pass more
completely into the private sector than the last lot. In many cases, the
former right-wing government managed to keep some control of privatised
companies by selling stakes in them to so-called noyaux durs or hard cores
of companies owned by Gaullist RPR party support-ers.
The Socialists tried to dismantle these groups by enlarging the ownership of
state companies, although they maintain the principle that some kind of
national control is needed. The Socialist-appointed chairman of Renault, Mr
Louis Schweitzer, for example, argues that his company must remain majority
French-controlled, if privatised.
But this time, it will be harder to press-gang noyaux durs into action.
Corporate France has less spare cash in these tough economic times than in
the late 1980s. The growth in foreign investment in French companies means
their boards now have to concentrate more on increasing earnings than
keeping on the right side of their political friends. Some noyaux durs
members received a poor return on their investments in the last round of
privatisations - both in profits and power - and so are cautious over being
drawn in again.
Big French corporate investors in new privatisations, therefore, will be
motivated more by industrial, rather than political logic. One example is
Alcatel Alsthom, the privatised telecommunications and engineering group,
whose chairman, Mr Pierre Suard, is close to the RPR. He says he is
interested in taking a stake in France Telecom, the state telecommunications
operator.
Other privatisation candidates might use this opportunity to speed up their
strategy of seeking share exchanges with foreign partners, like BNP and its
existing German partner, Dresdner Bank.
Despite the problems, few doubt that the privatisations will get off the
ground, cautiously at first because of the fragility of the Paris stock
market's recovery since the beginning of the year, but faster as the economy
picks up.
The programme is likely to be successful for two reasons. First, the
political will is there. The new government is likely to get a record
majority in the national assembly and should be able to impose its policies
with ease.
Second, there is more than enough pent-up demand. France's top industrial
companies are far less represented on the Paris stock exchange than their
competitors are on their domestic markets. The capitalisation of the Paris
stock market is equivalent to just 30 per cent of gross domestic product,
less than half the 65 per cent of US GDP represented by US stock markets,
estimates CS First Boston.
On the political front, Mr Edouard Balladur, who as former finance minister
masterminded the last round of right - wing privatis-ations and might be the
next prime minister, believes the process is essential.
He argues that it will make it easier for former state sector companies to
raise capital independently of the cash-strapped state; that it will
encourage more efficient management; and that the proceeds from the
programme will help the government fund the tax cuts needed to stimulate
France's flagging economy.
Privatisation is prominent on the joint RPR-UDF election manifesto, where it
commands more of a consensus among an otherwise divided coalition than other
economic matters, such as monetary policy. This is no surprise, for Mr
Balladur's sell-offs were one of the few real successes of the last
conservative government.
On the demand side, the opposition has several reasons to be optimistic.
First there is the FFr1,300bn of mainly private investors' savings now
sitting in lightly taxed Sicav money market funds.
A lot of that cash is likely to be seeking a new home in future, because the
ceiling below which Sicav disposals are tax-free was reduced in January from
FFr317,000 to FFr158,000 a year. For the first time in three years, the
total invested in Sicavs has started to fall, also helped by the launch of a
tax-exempt equity savings plan. A fall in interest rates, plus the extra tax
breaks for long-term private investments promised by the opposition, would
push more of French households' savings into equities.
Foreign institutional investors will be another big source of demand, if
they continue to increase their exposure to the French stock market.
According to the Banque de France, 28 per cent of French publicly quoted
shares are now in foreign hands, up from 21 per cent two years ago. If
foreign investors believe, as most analysts in Paris do, that the opposition
will be able to hold the line on the 'franc fort' policy, they will have a
clear interest in buying more shares in well-managed privatisations on the
brink of recovery.
What is unclear is just how much the new government will be able to curb the
temptation to meddle in its newly privatised companies. 'French industry is
still run by members of a small elite who move in and out of industry and
pol-itics,' explains a US securities analyst.
He adds: 'They need to purge the system, because it is so alien to what
their competitors are doing, but they are not ready to let go.'
Here the opposition is divided both on generational lines and between the
free-market UDF and the more interventionist RPR. Some of the older leaders
still believe in a degree of state intervention, while young reformers,
among them Mr Alain Madelin, former UDF industry minister, are strong
upholders of free markets.
An important test of whether or not the urge to intervene has receded will
be just how many Socialist-appointed public sector company chairman the
conservatives decide to throw out after the election. At least half a dozen
bosses of state companies will be particularly anxious about the first few
weeks of the next French government.

Not content with one begging letter, the Turks have just come up with five
in the hope of persuading the rest of the former Soviet Union's quintet of
Turkic states to join Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan in abandoning Cyrillic
notation in favour of Roman script.
Turkey's decision to increase the alphabet by the five new letters is a
historic gesture. It is the first such change since the western reforms of
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1928 when the Turks themselves adopted the Roman
script in place of the Arabic used under the Ottomans.
The additions, agreed after a four-day conference in Ankara, represent
sounds already voiced in the dialect of Turkish used in the republics.
Besides an additional e (written as a backwards E), the letters are a w, an
x, a q, and an n with the reverse of a French circumflex over the top.
As an added incentive to join the alphabetical alliance, Turkey is offering
the republics printing machinery and substantial technical assistance.

Not just one, but two feathers in its cap can be claimed by the outplacement
consultancy, Coutts, a subsidiary of the DC Gardner Group.
The first - helping to find new jobs for about 1,400 ex-employees of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International - is a fair feat in itself,
considering that no less than former CIA director Robert Gates publicly
rechristened BCCI 'the Bank of Crooks and Criminals International'.
But the second achievement is surely greater. According to DC Gardner's
chairman, Sir Kit McMahon, Coutts has been paid in full for the work by Abu
Dhabi's Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan - which is more than can be
claimed by most of BCCI's disgruntled creditors.

Some pretty improbable-sounding charities - such as the Solicitors

in The Henderson Top 1000 charities guide which has just been published by

But there is no disguising the fact that it is increasingly difficult to
differentiate big business from charity when it comes to jargon. One
contributor to the guide enthuses about improvements in 'donor base
technology' but warns that 'cold donor acquisition rates' are slipping below
the threshold of commercial viability on first mailing.
Not sure what it means, but no doubt it is all in a good cause.

One of the puzzles about HSBC Holdings is why no high-powered image
consultant has come up with a better handle. It's a funny name for one of
the world's top 10 banks. Cast an eye down the list of the world's blue-chip
lenders and one has to look a long way before finding a more forgettable
name than HSBC Holdings. Apparently, there was once talk about rechristening
Honkers and Shankers something rather airy-fairy like Trade Winds or
Mercator. But that idea was soon shot down as a bit too racy.
If the powers that be can't think up anything else, and given that two of
HSBC's main banks are called Midland, it might even be worth renaming the
group Midland Bank International . . . after a decent interval, of course.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Observer: Kerry's turn to roll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who stands to lose the most from Australia's rejection of the conservative
opposition parties in Saturday's general election? The answer is probably
not John Hewson, the luckless conservative leader, but Kerry Packer,
Australia's richest gambler.
In the past, Packer has made money under both Labor and conservative
governments. But the latest election result means there will be no change in
Australia's banking and media laws. That is bad news for Packer, who owns 10
per cent of Westpac Banking Corporation, and has recently acquired 5 per
cent of Fairfax - Conrad Black's Australian newspaper group.
Packer would like to bid for both groups, but is prevented by Labor
legislation which limits him to 15 per cent of each. He could have a tilt at
Fairfax if he sold the Channel Nine television operation, but that would
mean giving up control of Australia's top-rated tv channel, which is also a
big money-spinner.
However, Packer has been dealt worse hands before and come up trumps. He is
still showing a profit on his Westpac punt, and the underlying profitability
at Fairfax suggests he isn't going to lose a fortune there. Nevertheless, it
would be surprising if Packer were content to remain a passive investor for
long.
Although Westpac doesn't want Kerry on its board, perhaps Conrad Black
should hedge his bets by inviting him to join his Fairfax board. Even Black
might feel happier with Kerry on the inside.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Mr Major's talking head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Norman Lamont rises to de-liver the Budget this afternoon, watch Mr
John Major. You should be attentive to what will be one of the remarkable
phenomena of the week. Observe: words will come out of the chancellor's
mouth, but you will not see the prime minister's lips move. Mr Lamont's jaw
will waggle up and down, but there will be no indication that Mr Major's
hand is up the back of his jacket.
You may be forgiven for thinking that your eyes are deceiving you. The
Budget will be read out as if by Charlie McCarthy, America's most famous
wooden effigy; the ventriloquist will be Mr Edgar Bergen, aka John Major.
Some chancellors - Lord Lawson springs to mind - never sat on their prime
ministers' knees, although even in the latter's case there was always
something he wanted in the Budget that Lady Thatcher didn't, and vice-versa.
Some rely for their jobs, their reputations, their very political existence,
on the whims of their immediate boss. In the present instance the dependence
is two-way: Edgar Bergen desperately needs Charlie McCarthy to perform well;
Charlie cannot perform without him.
Old hands will protest that 'it was ever thus'. Chancellors meet prime
ministers once a week or so for 'bilaterals'. It is always important that
the prime minister of the day concurs with the strategy for managing the
economy put to her or him by the chancellor. It is therefore unfair to Mr
Lamont to argue that he is mouthing Mr Major's policies.
Possibly. The truth is that there is something more important at stake this
afternoon than whether this particular chancellor remains in office until
this summer, next summer, or the one thereafter. Today's Budget is regarded
by Downing Street as a part of the slow and necessarily painful process of
putting Britain's administration back together again. It is intended to help
reconstruct the authority that was shattered on Black Wednesday. For Mr
Major and his chancellor have yet to rebuild the nation's confidence in
their ability to do the jobs they are paid to do. If their remuneration was
performance-related, and assessed according to public esteem, they would be
living on social security.
The pair of them are in the same boat, up the same creek, searching for the
same paddle. If, as many believe, the chancellor irretrievably lost his
honour when he failed to resign on that fateful Wednesday, what of the prime
minister? Both had defended Bri-tain's position in the exchange rate
mechanism with equal fervour, Mr Major because he believed in it, Mr Lamont
because he had to. Both had spoken of the irresponsibility of abandoning the
fixed exchange rate, right up to the moment that sterling was ejected from
the mechanism. Some of their ministerial colleagues believe that the
chancellor should have offered himself as a sacrifice, thus deflecting
criticism from Mr Major. We do not live in such heroic times.
The prime minister does of course have the authority to replace Mr Lamont,
but he remains to be convinced that it would be politically profitable for
him to do so. It is probable that the success or failure of the chancellor's
current energetic efforts to win a sympathetic hearing will weigh at least
as heavily for or against him as the actual contents of today's Budget. The
prime minister can influence or control the fiscal stance. He can pull the
strings on that. Image is another matter. Only the chancellor can turn
himself into an effective persuader.
It is becoming fashionable for politicians to recognise that that is what
they need to do. President Clinton, learning the lesson taught with such
brilliance by President Reagan, is showing that he understands that direct
communication with the electorate, always a necessary part of democratic
government, is indispensable in the age of television. Mr Douglas Hurd, one
of the British government's few skilled practitioners of electronic
persuasion, spoke last Friday about a growing ten-sion between 'achievers
and critics'.
The burden of the foreign secretary's remarks was that the critics,
especially when they 'hunt as a pack', create 'stereotypes which can lead us
astray from reality'. Mr Hurd is right. Britain's media gather as baying
hounds upon this prey or that, nearly always collectively. The foreign
secretary's remarks also suggest that doers are of greater importance than
those who merely carp. As a former doer, but now one of the latter breed, I
bow my head in acknowledgement - adding only that when achievers make a mess
of things, we critics get inordinate enjoyment out of feeding on their
flesh.
That is what has happened to the government. Its more sanguine ministers
believe - hope - that the pack will start baying a different tune when
economic recovery is seen to be under way. The little matter of the bill to
ratify the Maastricht treaty must also be over and done with. As to that,
the government's chief whip, Mr Richard Ryder, accepts that he cannot cobble
together a majority unless Labour abstains. Procedural motions, and
amendments for which Labour proposes to vote in favour, will be lost. But
Labour needs to abstain on the big issues, in order to maintain its own
unity.
You will see from this summary of its position to date that the government
has positioned itself on a ladder of achievement, upon which it aims to
climb away from the critics' jaws. The first step was last autumn's public
spending statement. The second is this afternoon's Budget, the third the
passage of the Maastricht bill. Economic recovery is the final leap.
It will not be so easy as that sounds. The autumn spending controls were
relatively painless; it is the current search for long-term cuts that is
truly difficult. The economic recovery will have to run long and strong
before the fear of unemployment is eliminated from Conservative voters'
minds. The Maastricht bill remains a gamble.
Tomorrow's verdict on the Budget, almost certainly favourable, will be
premature. As the late Iain MacLeod used to say, you should not judge a
Budget until the finance bill is published. That is about a month away.
Meanwhile, to save himself, and his mentor, Charlie McCarthy will have to
keep talking, swivelling his head round to whoever will catch his eye.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Watching the whirlwind: The battle for a car executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON, CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bizarre tug of war between two of the world's leading automobile groups
for the services of an idiosyncratic Spaniard who calls his staff 'warriors'
appeared to have ended yesterday in victory for Germany's Volkswagen and
defeat for General Motors of the US.
GM announced in Detroit yesterday afternoon that 52-year-old Mr J Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, its colourful head of worldwide purchasing, had
definitely quit - apparently to take up a contract of employment with
Volkswagen - after five days of wavering between the two companies.
However, a bemused Mr Jack Smith, GM's chief executive, told a news
conference, scheduled to announce that Mr Lopez was staying in Detroit, that
'it is not clear to me what his intentions are, or where he is at the
present time.'
Volkswagen had spent weeks carefully wooing Mr Lopez, but GM fought a
furious last ditch campaign to persuade him to stay, including an offer of
promotion to executive vice president of GM and the presidency of its North
American automotive operations.
But, despite the promotion and entreaties from tearful members of his
purchasing team, Mr Lopez decided to leave.
Whatever the factors prompting the departure, such an intense battle over a
man who just a year ago was unknown outside the automobile manufacturing
world illustrates how VW and GM's North American operations share some
serious problems in common, notably bloated cost structures.
Mr Lopez, who was head of parts purchasing for GM Europe, based in
Russelsheim, West Germany, between 1988 and 1992, was a key member of the
team which turned GM Europe from losses into one of the world's most
profitable vehicle businesses - and a stark contrast to the company's core
North American operations, which have lost Dollars 12bn over the past two
years.
He radically altered GM's relations with its European suppliers and shifted
a large quantity of work from high cost German parts companies to cheaper
manufacturers in other parts of the region. GM ended up with one of the
lowest cost bases of any European assembler.
In May last year Mr Smith, a former head of GM Europe, summoned Mr Lopez to
Detroit to do the same in North America as part of a belated restructuring
which also involves the closure of 21 plants and loss of at least 75,000
jobs over the next few years.
Mr Lopez set about the job with gusto. He infuriated some of GM's outside
suppliers by insisting that they slash their prices by 20 per cent or more.
He initiated a system where hit-squads, so-called Picos teams, went into
parts factories inside and outside GM, looking for ways to improve
production methods.
Critics argued that his cost-cutting demands could have endangered the
quality of some GM parts, or discouraged suppliers from carrying out
research and development with the company. But Mr Lopez and his supporters
pointed out that he had been offering much longer-term contracts to those
parts companies which could meet GM's quality, service and price
specifications.
Whatever the truth, his campaign saved GM hundreds of millions of dollars
and his presence in Detroit was one of the most powerful catalysts for
change inside the slow-moving, bureaucratic company, sending a powerful
signal to employees and suppliers alike that it was deadly serious about its
restructuring.
With an engaging smile, and in broken but passionate English, he repeatedly
warned the American motor industry that western industrial society risked
defeat at the hands of the Japanese.
'We must transform the Western ability to create intelligent excuses into
positive creativity,' he declared in a speech earlier this month, taking a
swipe at suppliers who complained he was making impossible demands of them.
His personal idiosyncrasies have added to the impression of fundamental
change. For example, one of his first actions on arrival in Detroit was to
issue staff with a booklet describing his preferred 'warrior diet,' which
eschewed 'poisonous' sugar and potatoes and encouraged the consumption of
only fruit for breakfast.
However, the Lopez revolution is a long way from completion - he was
planning more than 1,000 Picos workshops in suppliers' plants this year, and
more than 1,300 in GM ones - and his departure for Volkswagen after only 10
months in the job will almost certainly slow the momentum of the company's
reforms.
Volkswagen, for its part, is in urgent need of fundamental reform and Mr
Ferdinand Piech, chief executive since the beginning of the year, is
expected to announce Mr Lopez's appointment as part of a radical upheaval of
senior personnel to be disclosed after today's supervisory board meeting.
Mr Piech already has two former, but more junior, GM managers on his staff
at VW's Audi subsidiary. Mr Erich Schmitt, a one-time member of Mr Lopez's
cost-cutting team, was recently appointed director in charge of buying,
finance and organisation.
Mr Jurgen Gebhardt, Audi's new production director, was poached from Adam
Opel, GM's German subsidiary, where he was plant manager at the low-cost
showpiece works in Eisenach, eastern Germany. Opel has dented VW's
self-esteem by stealing market leadership in the former GDR - even though
the VW brand was recognised by more than 60 per cent of former east Germans
before reunification, compared to less than 30 per cent for Opel.
VW is thought to have made an operating loss of DM1bn in its core VW
division last year and is woefully inefficient compared to other European
and Japanese volume manufacturing competitors.
While its rivals began rationalising more than a year ago, VW is only now
taking the hard decisions which will enable the group to weather what Mr
Piech last week termed the worst downturn in the German motor industry since
1945.
VW needs to drastically reduce its cost structures over the next 12 to 18
months. In part this could be achieved by reducing personnel - hard enough
in Germany under any circumstances, even harder at VW, where the supervisory
board is (unusually for Germany) dominated by union representatives and
where 20 per cent of the shares are owned by state of Lower Saxony,
currently governed by a Social Democratic/Green coalition.
VW has also begun to realise that it needs to reform its relationship with
its suppliers. Audi's Mr Schmitt recently said the group had set the goal of
reducing the prices of components purchased from outside suppliers by 25 to
30 per cent over the next four to five years.
Mr Lopez could, therefore be the change agent VW needs - although his
mercurial, Hamlet-like behaviour over the past five days might make Mr Piech
wonder just what kind of one-man whirlwind he is getting.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Not so much tropical rainforest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof GHILLEAN T PRANCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I should like to correct the alarmingly optimistic figure for the area
of this planet which is covered by tropical forest, given in your article,
'FAO cuts estimate of tropical forest loss' (March 9). This states that 37
per cent of the planet is covered in tropical forest.
It states correctly that, according to FAO figures, 1.75bn hectares of
tropical forest remain; however, this is not 37 per cent of the planet. It
is 3.4 per cent of the total area of the planet and 11.6 per cent of the
total land surface of the planet.
More alarming for those of us trying to preserve the biodiversity of the
species-rich tropical rainforest is that it has now been reduced to 0.83bn
hectares, or only 5.5 per cent of the total land surface.
There is no room for complacency if we are to preserve this ecosystem which
is so vital for the functioning of our planet.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Perfectly clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr INNES HAMILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your comment ('Major must persevere', March 10) that 'Paddy Ashdown
wants his party to be noticed' and use of the word cynically were
regrettable and unworthy.
The Liberal Democrats have made it perfectly clear that they will use every
endeavour to obtain ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Equally that they
will do all possible to ensure that the social chapter is included. Nothing
could be clearer than those aims and I am sure they will vote accordingly.
It is a pity that others are less clear and constructive.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Only one justification for no tax increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof DOUGLAS MCWILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I hesitate to question Mr Samuel Brittan's analysis, though my
hesitation is not increased by the fact that he can pray in support six of
the government's allegedly wise men. The quality of an economic judgment
seems to be inversely proportional to the number of economists putting it
forward simultaneously - witness the 364 co-signatories of the 1981 letter
to the Times or 4,000 ex-employees of the East German ministry of economics.
But Mr Brittan's argument that a tax increase should be delayed (Economic
Viewpoint, February 25) appears to be based on an inconsistent theory of
expectations formulation. If a tax increase is considered to be probable, in
the real world most people will take this into account in their behaviour
even before it is announced. So the case for delaying an inevitable tax
increase is weak.
The only justification for Mr Lamont avoiding a rise in taxes in his Budget
is that he may feel that taxes will not need to be raised at all. If he
feels confident that Mr Portillo's review will deliver sizeable cuts in
public spending, this would justify a neutral Budget, leaving the revised
levels of public spending to be announced in November.
While the government continues to borrow Pounds 1bn a week, it remains
subject to the moods of the financial markets. And these markets have tended
not to give Mr Lamont the benefit of the doubt. Their confidence in UK
economic prospects is only likely to revive when the chancellor puts forward
a programme to eliminate public borrowing based on something more credible
than Ms Rosy Scenario (who made an unwelcome reappearance in the Autumn
Statement). Such a programme would improve the trade-off between interest
rates and the exchange rate and create scope for further cuts in interest
rates if the recovery fails to gain momentum.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Ford chief spells out how UK government must aid
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN MCALLISTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader about manufacturing on March 8, you said that the answer
to previous difficulties lies partly in government policies but also in the
hands of industrialists. This is true, and for our part at Ford we have been
working with some success to improve our basic design, engineering and
assembly capabilities. Also, we have been investing in new products right
through the recession. Our aim, along with many other manufacturers, is to
provide more exciting, safer products, with higher quality and lower costs.
From the government, in the near term, we hope that in today's Budget there
will be no measures that will stifle the first indications of recovery in
car sales, and that revisions to company car tax will not result in tax
bands that would continue to cause distortion of the market at threshold
levels.
More fundamentally, we believe that the government should support industry
through the provision of better scientific, technical and management
education. Further, we consider that any education or training programme
should recognise the importance of developing professional standards, at all
levels of industry. Government should also assess the merits of establishing
a new science and engineering college with the ambition to earn a reputation
for excellence similar to that of universities such as MIT in the US.
The government can help industry by creating the right economic environment.
This includes stability in policies, investing in the nation's
infrastructure, the creation of a true common market in Europe, and a
conclusion of the Uruguay Round.
With respect to investment from Japan, Britain should examine carefully
whether it is likely to strengthen or weaken the base of vital research and
engineering skills in this country. For example, Japanese cars produced in
the UK, together with the components they contain, are largely designed and
engineered at centres in Japan.
Finally, the powerful long-term causal links between manufacturing success
and success in key service businesses should not be forgotten. The huge
success of Japanese manufacturing exports of the last decade made possible
the dramatic growth of Japanese banking around the world; not the other way
around.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Economic reasoning is faulty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT SOLOMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lester Thurow's Personal View (March 10) on the need for the expanding
US economy to 'decouple' from its trade partners contains some remarkably
faulty economic reasoning.
Ha argues that a surge in manufactured imports would create increased
unemployment as the US 'locomotive' moves ahead faster than other countries.
Yet that surge in imports would depend on a much larger surge of demand and
gross domestic product in America.
Imports of manufacture constitute only 5 per cent of America's GDP. Thus to
get Thurow's Dollars 45bn surge of such imports, GDP would have to move
ahead by Dollars 900bn or 15 per cent. That would create many more new jobs
than the Dollars 45bn of additional imports would displace.
This is rather obvious first-level economics, and it is surprising that the
Dean of the Sloan School at MIT needs this lesson.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Reality of PowerGen pay talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The headline to your report on PowerGen's pay offer ('PowerGen grants
pay deal of up to 5 per cent', March 12) talked the level of the settlement
up to 5 per cent but, as was correctly reported in the latter part of the
story, the reality is different. Such exaggeration damages the process of
open and fair negotiation.
The offer which is now to be subject to a ballot of the trades unions'
members in PowerGen is for a 2.5 per cent increase in basic salaries for all
staff. A further one-off lump sum bonus in recognition of productivity
improvements is attached to the offer. Both sides recognise the substantial
nature of such 'improvements', which have come from staff reductions of
about 1,000 in the last year and nearly 4,000 since privatisation.
Although the government does indeed still own 40 per cent of PowerGen it has
maintained a consistent refusal to take an active role in the company's
affairs (even when the coal crisis may have justified it). I have no
hesitation in defending the freedom of both sides in the negotiations to
reach an agreement tailored to PowerGen's circumstances.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Donizetti's 'Roberto Devereux' - Opera in Genoa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The building of a new opera-house is such an expensive business and so
fraught with potential problems that it is only the rash or the
exceptionally well-funded who would be advised to contemplate it at all. In
the last decade neither the Bastille in Paris nor the Muziektheater in
Amsterdam met with an unqualified chorus of rapture.
The Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa has won more harmonious applause. Strictly
speaking, it is not a new building, as the shell of its predecessor remained
after war damage in 1943. It has also taken the best part of 15 years to
reach fruition even from the selection of the definitive project (the Royal
Opera will know about this problem). But for an opera-house totally
re-conceived and built afresh, amply spacious, lavishly appointed, it is
difficult to think of a city luckier than Genoa.
As befits its original frontage, the interior of the theatre has kept in
touch with classical features, albeit interpreted in a modern style. The
auditorium (about 2,000 seats) is unlike any other in Italy, or anywhere
else for that matter. The side walls are fashioned to resemble Venetian
houses with their balconies forming the traditional side boxes, looking down
on the stalls as though over a central piazza - a novel idea, which gives
the theatre a thoroughly Italian atmosphere of its own.
All this, however, is a mere counterpoint to its triumphant main theme: the
excellence of the acoustics. According to a recent opinion-poll the sound
qualities of the new theatre have won almost unanimous approval, and I am
not surprised. The voices project with remarkable clarity. At the
performance of Donizetti's Roberto Devereux which I saw on Sunday each
singer had only to step to the front of the stage to ensure an enormous
vocal impact.
What with La Favorite in Cardiff and L'assedio di Calais at London's
Guildhall School of Music in the last fortnight, it would seem that
Donizetti's serious operas may be inviting re-appraisal ahead of his
bicentenary in 1997. Roberto Devereux is one of the most red-blooded of all.
To succeed, a performance needs to work up a real head of steam in the royal
show-down that crowns Act 2 and that is what Jan Latham Koenig achieved
here, conducting the very respectable Genovese orchestra.
With the exception of the main character of Elizabeth I - the Polish soprano
Jolanta Omilian, not a great voice, but dramatic and strong, able to stamp
her authority on the opera - the roles were cast with some of the best of
the younger Italian singers. Vincenzo La Scola was the stylish tenor Earl of
Essex; the baritone Roberto Frontali sang a well-focused, firm Duke of
Nottingham. Best of all was Gloria Scalchi, who showed no sign of strain at
all in tackling the high mezzo part of Sara: clearly a notable talent.
Audiences in Genoa are liable to express their displeasure at modern
productions, so there was no suggestion of updating this piece of Tudor
historical fiction to the era of Thatcherite domination or Italian political
corruption scandals. The staging was grandly traditional, with luxurious
drapes and tapestries providing opulent spectacle for its Palace of
Westminster locale. On its own terms it all worked splendidly and was a
first-rate advertisement for a company happily settled in its new home.
With four years to go, the Royal Opera in London might also want to think
about extending its repertoire to more of Donizetti's historical operas. The
addition of Roberto Devereux, arguably the most exciting musically of the
three works, to its existing Anna Bolena and Maria Stuarda, would make a
properly regal trilogy.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Peter Grimes - Opera in concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high point of Mstislav Rostropovich's current Britten Festival at the
Barbican was intended to be the two concert performances of Peter Grimes. Up
to a point, the intention was realised.
On Sunday, the excellence of the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus was
the ballast of the performance. Since the principal gain of such
operas-in-concert is the host of opportunities offered for close-up
examination of the score, the fine quality of the playing only enhanced
admiration for the myriad fine detail of the music. A beautifully poised
viola solo launching the Passacaglia offered a notable instance; so too the
pithily characterful utterance of the Act 3 dance band, placed just close
enough to allow the listener to note anew how subtly Britten worked its
nippy pleasantries into the fabric of gathering dramatic tensions.
A front-rank cast had been engaged: again, the pleasures of witnessing its
most assured members in action fed one's admiration for the phrases Britten
wrote for their characters. A singer's aim on such occasions should be the
nicely judged infusion of characterisation into the smooth, clear delivery
of notes. Such sharp-profiled singer-actors as John Dobson (Boles), John
Connell (Swallow), Anne Collins (Mrs Sedley), Menai Davies (Auntie) and the
sparky Jason Howard (Keene) - all experienced in the Grimes productions of
Glyndebourne, ENO or Covent Garden - hit home their points with vivid
economy. It was good to hear Ryland Davies taking a character role, the
Rector, with such elegance. Platform entrances and exits added to the
concert-drama - not, though, the addled boo-hoo-ing of the female
chorus-member filling in for the boy apprentice.
But the three principals, newcomers to their roles, revealed their
inexperience in ways that sometimes rocked the concert-opera balance. Bryn
Terfel's preening of his youthfully magnificent bass-baritone made only a
superficial connection with Balstrode. Nancy Gustafson, dressed as a
handsome West Coast belle with a glitter of diamonds in her hair, sang with
a generalised warmth that too rarely found the centre of Ellen's precisely
placed notes.
It can be no easy matter to undertake one's first Grimes in the city where
Peter Pears and Jon Vickers have held sway. The Canadian Ben Heppner, a
heroic singer of uncommon intelligence, sensitivity and bounteous vocal
gifts, struggled with those portions of the vocal writing most closely
linked with Pears's tenorial idiosyncrasies. He will surely find his way
deeper into the role, and should be fervently encouraged to do so - but, let
us hope, under a conductor less far removed from the opera's 'real world'
than Rostropovich. To be brutally frank, it seemed to me that on this
showing, and for all the conductor's generosity and musicianly enthusiasm,
he hasn't a clue of how Peter Grimes actually goes.
Second Barbican Grimes concert tomorrow

FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Pop go the Sixties - William Packer both admires and
questions the exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first thing to say of this large exhibition of British art in the 1960s,
that David Mellor - he of Sussex University - has selected and documented so
copiously, is that it is beautifully presented, fascinating and extremely
enjoyable at every turn. The second, which follows inevitably upon anything
whatsoever to do with 'the Sixties' - to those of us, that is, whose early
career was coincidental with them - is that of course it is misconceived.
The exhibition's faults are the creatures of its virtues, for Mellor is so
taken with his material, in all its aspects, that he offers us neither a
thorough documentary nor a straight-forward celebration of the art, shown on
its own terms for its own sake. We are taken down the byways of the social
history of the times, tramping along the road from Aldermaston, reading
Private Eye and the International Times, gazing at Christine Keeler, mocking
Harold Macmillan, or Harold Wilson as the case may be, listening to the
Beatles and The Who, sitting in at Hornsey.
And as we browse, so we find ourselves chewing on the art - tachisme, or
'action painting'; colour-field abstraction; Pop painting, hard-edge and
optical; New Generation sculpture and incipient conceptualism. So again we
are deflected back to the documentary, to the places and the circumstances,
to the loose and shifting affiliations and interests of artists throughout
the period. Back we go to the Royal College; the studios and bomb-sites of
Notting Hill of the late 1950s; and to the wharfs and warehouses of Saint
Katherine's Dock 10 years on. The photographs in particular are marvellous,
by Roger Mayne, Roger Coleman, Roger Freeman, Lewis Morley and Don McCullin
 -all those fresh, young, earnest, ambitious faces. I had expected such
stuff to make me feel rather old. I can only say that I came away feeling
not as old as all that.
It is all wonderfully indulgent and enjoyable, but the doubts remain, even
so. The problem with any such survey is that it can never be at once
hermetic and inclusive, particular and comprehensive. And with the Sixties,
saddled with that tendentious reputation and over-simple label, the problem
becomes acute. What were 'the Sixties', and when, if ever, did they begin?
For anyone of my generation, born in the late 1930s and early '40s, they
began, if ever, long before, with Elvis and Brando, Osborne, Kerouac and
Traditional Jazz, Suez and Hungary. By 1965 or so, with satire and Profumo,
the minicar and Jean Shrimpton's legs, they were over. The Sixties of
Wilson, Flower Power, Protest, Prague and Paris, Sergeant Pepper and Peace &amp;
Love, were always another age, another world.
In eliding the two periods, Mellor rather misses the point, and the
opportunity, both in sociological and creative terms. Nor does his basic
premise hold: that here is a period now so neglected as to be in dire need
of critical rehabilitation. Where has he been all these years? Private View,
the Russell, Robertson, Snowdon encapsulation of his early period was
published in 1965, and to turn its glossy, stylish pages today is hardly to
move back into a vanished world.
Where are they now, Caro and Paolozzi, Freud and Auerbach, Jones and Blake,
Caulfield and Hoyland, Riley and Hodgkin, King and Hockney? Well, still
here, I suppose. The world has moved on, and while some artists have fallen
into obscurity, following generations, of sculptors especially, have had
their day in their turn. But, for all that, we are hardly addressing total
eclipse.
Mellor speaks of 'realigning parts of the hidden history of British art',
and quite rightly draws attention again to the work of William Green, with
his action painting; to Tony Messenger and his expressionist image of James
Dean's crashed car; to Pauline Boty, who died young, with her definitive
Marilyn, 'The only Blonde in the World'. But where are the kitchen-sink
painters and where, in particular, is Bratby, with his paintings for the
film of 'The Horse's Mouth', with Alec Guinness as Gulley Jimson? And if
there are to be the compendium and collage-based paintings of Boty, Blake
and Phillips, where are those of Anthony Donaldson? And if the St Martin's
sculptors are well represented, why is there so little of Paolozzi, and why
nothing at all of the Royal College sculptors of the time, Hall, Panting,
Plackman and the rest?
But we are all experts on the Sixties, and to carp too much is too easy. I
wish that Mellor had confined himself to the earlier period, but, that said,
I can only admit that he has most admirably caught the energy and sense of
engagement that so characterised it. In those early, still comparatively
innocent days, it was an energy directed above all upon the work itself and
the doing of it. Hopes were that it would attract notice, that it would
sell, that a name would be made thereby - but which young artist has not
hoped as much? The important thing was that the work was done anyway, for
its own sake, and today its essential integrity still shines out.
Most of all it is apparent here in the 'Situation' abstraction, shown by the
Arts Council in 1963 - the first flush of maturity in the work of such as
Gillian Ayres, the Cohen brothers, Hoyland, Law, Irwin, Mundy, Plumb, Smith,
Vaux and Young. There they all were, European in sensibility yet responding
to what was coming out of New York, looking about them but remaining quite
themselves. They were professional enough - the professional ethic would
come later. Mellor is quite right in this respect, that here is an authentic
British school we have consistently undersold.
The Sixties: art scene in London; the Barbican Art Gallery, the Barbican
Centre EC2, until June 13, supported by the Hulton Deutsch Collection; Apple
UK; Atlantis European. David Mellor's excellent and substantial book on the
exhibition - more than a mere catalogue - is published by Phaidon, Pounds 22

Mr Lamont is due to stand up in the House some time after 3.30 but,
broadcast news being what it is these days (heavy on speculation) you can
choose from programmes which begin anything up to an hour earlier. Budget 93
on BBC2 starts at 2.30 and fields the heavy brigade: David Dimbleby, Peter
Snow and Peter Jay. At 3.00 Radio 4 gets under way with PM Budget Special
presented by Wendy Austin and Frank Partridge. For ITV's Budget 93 starting
at 3.15 the presenters are John Suchet and Nicholas Owen, with Julia
Somerville at Westminster and Dermot Murnaghan in the City. Then, at the
sensible starting time of 3.30, Radio 2 joins in with Jimmy Young and
Dominick Harrod presenting Budget Special. They promise not only comment and
analysis but music: irresistible, surely. Assignment considers the
peculiarly powerful position of soap opera in Brazil (7.45 BBC2). Secret
Nature is a series about wildlife in the English Channel (8.30 BBC2).
Camille Paglia's contribution to Without Walls was notorious long before
today's screening since she talks about the Princess of Wales as sex goddess

FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Frank Pig Says Hello - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Pig Says Hello at the Royal Court Upstairs represents a type of play
increasing its popularity in studio venues: a tight, two-handed psychodrama
which asks actors and designer to be versatile, and in order to make itself
understood urges the audience to sever contact with the rational world. But
this makes deadly, wearisome and stultifying theatre.
Patrick McCabe's first play is an adaptation of his own fine novel, The
Butcher Boy, midway between Patrick McGrath's Spider and Ian McEwan's The
Cement Garden. It comes from the Gate Theatre, Dublin after winning  -
inexplicably - a Dublin 'New Play' award last year.
The stage action centres on the mental life of Francie 'Piglet' Brady, his
daydreams and his psychoses. The play eschews plot, and opts for series of
revisited and altered scenes from Brady's childhood intercut with episodes
from later life. He turns out to be a sad child enslaved to fantasies from
1950s comics. He is disruptive at home and school, in league with a
real-imaginary friend who becomes his alter ego in later life. His mother
kills herself, his father dies and stays unburied in the parlour, while
Brady takes a job in an abattoir.
The verbal interplay between past and present is a technical triumph for
actors David Gorry and Sean Rocks, who deliver quick-fire Irish banter, but
it makes woeful dialogue on stage: 'I had news for Philip. Philip, I have
news for you. News? Yes, News. For me? Yes.'
This play fails because, despite director Joe O'Byrne's ingenuity in
switching between scenes, the play makes no concerted impact. No one scene
causes another one; the logic of psychosis means that anything can happen at
any time, and that removes suspense. The narrative moves quickly, but by
telling everything, it prevents tensions, affections and events from being
shown and acted out. The appearance of a character with a red handkerchief
is preceded by 'He had a red handkerchief in his pocket, and the crease on
his trousers would cut your hand.'
Elsewhere, the action leans on musical effects: Glen Miller's 'Don't Sit
Under The Apple Tree' recurs periodically to punctuate the scenes, as does
Brady's own song, 'I'm a little baby pig I'll have you all to know, with my
little curly tale and my nose that turns up so.'
The result is a confusing, difficult and annoying play which fosters a short
attention span. Such works have altered the course of theatre. But this
offers neither information nor moral challenge. It settles into an
intellectual game. It makes its effect not in the situation which it creates
for the characters, but in the smiles and scowls of the actors. It is a
shame and a waste that the piece is so well acted.
Royal Court Upstairs until April 3, then on a national tour through April
and May

FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Arditti String Quartet - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday the Purcell Room was packed for the Arditti's third recital (of
four, concluding this Friday) in their survey of Schoenberg and his
associates. Reporting on the first, Andrew Clements wrote here that their
ultra-assured playing disclosed too little searching passion; but this time
they warmed to their task at once, to much more exciting effect.
They began with Webern's sole 'twelve-note' quartet, op. 28. With its spare,
intricate, serenely unfolding patterns, it is not obviously a thing to stir
the blood - but the composer's rigorous economy has potent charms. A
performance so attentive as the Arditti's was to paragraphing and natural
breathing, to balance and to the vital nodes of the music, cannot but
re-create Webern's original passion for combining abstract inquiry with
precise appreciation of string-sound. Everything told; it was a clairvoyant
account, and one to remind us why Webern's later music struck a postwar
generation of composers with more revelatory force than Schoenberg's own.
For contrast the Arditti threw in Webern's 1906 'Rondo", a recent exhumation
and a loquacious, skittery exercise in chromatics which shows what Webern -
and Alban Berg too - might have stuck at, had their individual passion for
deeper organisation (and Schoenberg's own stern example) not propelled them
onward.
Hearing Schoenberg's 1927 Third Quartet next made the point vividly.
Post-tonal writing could aspire to a Beethovenian density, but only if its
defining rules were as tough as Beethoven's period-tonal ones had been. This
Third, like Bartok's Fourth, used to have a reputation for pursuing an ideal
of the New all too single-mindedly (where their later quartets were supposed
to aim at friendlier compromises). The Arditti performance proved that
intelligent loyalty to the new plan can attain complete expressive
conviction without cheating, without falling back upon stock Romantic
echoes.
That bracing result was only slightly compromised, after the interval, by
the Arditti's coolly rapturous account of Schoenberg's Verklarte Nacht
sextet (with two distinguished guests from the Alban Berg Quartet). Might it
be a precondition for playing later Schoenberg so well that the players must
have fathomed earlier Schoenberg, post-Romantic but pre-'dodecaphonic', with
such sympathy?
From the start of the 1899 sextet, where the Arditti turned the usual thick
bass-swells into hard, doomy throbs, thus sharpening the drama of the piece
immeasurably, it was clear that this 'Transfigured Night' would be freshly
transfigured. And it was: the later contrapuntal strife transparently
argued, the apotheosis made luminous by professional care for the notes,
without super-added sentiment. Before and after his single-handed musical
revolution, Schoenberg earned just such searching executive attention - but
inspired champions of the Arditti order have been few and far between.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: No clear-cut favourite - The three
options for reforming the law on abuse of market power by dominant companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government is shortly expected to announce its preferred option for
reforming the law on companies abusing their power in the marketplace to
stifle competition. In a green paper published last November, Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, canvassed three options. These
are:
to retain the existing case-by-case approach under the 1973 Fair Trading Act
and 1980 Competition Act for dealing with anti-competitive practices. Under
this option, the Office of Fair Trading would be given stronger
investigatory powers and businesses would be made liable for damages and
possible civil penalties for continuing abuse;
to introduce a general prohibition on abuse of market power based on Article
86 of the Treaty of Rome, backed by tough investigatory powers for the OFT
and fines on companies of up to 10 per cent of worldwide turnover;
to introduce a general prohibition, give tough investigatory powers to the
OFT and authorise stiff financial penalties, but retain the investigation
provisions of the Fair Trading Act, which allow for industry-wide monopoly
inquires.
Initial reading of the green paper suggested that the government favoured
the third option. This in itself was a big shift from its position just two
years ago. Speaking about competition policy in July 1990, Mr John Redwood,
then corporate affairs minister, said: 'Existing UK competition law has
plenty of powers to enforce open and fair markets. There are already several
statutes giving extensive investigatory powers to the authorities. The
government has decided not to introduce a prohibition-based policy on abuse
of dominant position but to concentrate on effective use of existing
powers.'
The change in attitude since 1990 reflects growing pressure for
comprehensive reform. The government remains committed to reform of
restrictive practices legislation, and is aware of the contradiction of
changing the law on anti-competitive agreements while leaving the law on
abuse of market power unchanged.
Since 1990, subsidiarity - allowing decision-making to be carried out at the
lowest appropriate level - has emerged as a leading issue within the EC.
Brussels has made it clear that in future it will deal only with the most
significant competition infringements or cases which are likely to advance
the law, leaving the rest to the national courts.
There is also genuine concern that the present UK system is not working. It
is weak on deterrents, and the 1980 Competition Act has provided slow and
ineffective procedures for tackling abuse.
In light of such pressures, those businesses hoping that the consultation
exercise will result in a decision not to change the law on monopoly power
are likely to be disappointed. The key question, however, is whether the
responses to the green paper have persuaded the government to shift ground
since November, away from a position close to option 3 - calling for a
general prohibition - to one based on option 1 - retaining the case-by-case
approach. Mr Heseltine's problem is that no clear consensus on the best
option has emerged.
The Confederation of British Industry, after extensive consultation with its
own members, is broadly against any reform, but if the government is
determined to press ahead, then it would favour some variation based on
option 1.
Businesses used to competing with a dominant player in the market, such as
Mercury Communications, are generally behind option 3. The Consumers'
Association also supports it. 'Restraints on competition almost always act
against the consumer, by encouraging inefficiency, by limiting choice and by
enhancing the power of vested interests,' says Mr Stephen Locke, CA's
director of policy. 'What is needed, and already exists at Community level,
are clear prohibitions, substantial penalties for breaching them and full
rights for third-party redress, enforced by an agency with strong powers of
investigation.'
The views of competition lawyers appear to vary with the position of their
corporate clients. But when they divorce their views from their clients'
interests, most appear to favour options 2 or 3.
The government, too, finds itself in a quandary in that a prohibition on
abuse of a dominant position would have a huge impact on the regulated
utilities, such as telecommunications, gas and electricity. It retains a
golden share in most of them and might understandably be reluctant to adopt
a regime which could have a big effect on the way they currently do
business. On the other hand, the government is aware that there can be no
justification for a prohibition not applying to the regulated utilities.
The view of the CBI will undoubtedly carry weight. The employers'
organisation says a prohibition is too inflexible and 'an inappropriate tool
for ensuring that markets are competitive'. Even dominant companies must be
in a position from which they can react to competitive pressures, it says.
The CBI wants to retain a system which enables cases to be dealt with on an
ad hoc basis rather than attempting to devise rules which make generalised
distinctions between competitive and anti-competitive practices and ban the
latter. It is unacceptable, the CBI adds, 'that business could become liable
for fines for behaviour which at the time it was undertaken was believed to
be legal'.
The CBI also believes a system based on prohibition would impose very high
costs on business in the form of compliance and these costs would not be
offset by any benefit resulting from the change - a view which is partially
supported by many competition lawyers.
This looks like a 'big industry' response to the issues raised by the green
paper. But the CBI insists that it represents the views of its members
across the board. The CBI's smaller-companies council is particularly
concerned that small and medium-sized enterprises would bear a
disproportionately high percentage of the costs imposed by a prohibition
system.
The views of companies such as Mercury (which has competed against BT, the
dominant player in telecommunications, for the past 11 years) cannot be
ignored, however. In contrast to the CBI's 'if-it-ain't-bust-don't-fix-it'
message, Mercury believes that if the present system is proven to be
inadequate then tinkering with it should not be an option. It believes that,
for the regulated industries, industry-specific rules are not effective
enough to deter anti-competitive behaviour. Instead, it argues, a radical
solution is needed. It favours the introduction of a prohibition system
making anti-competitive conduct per se unlawful, backed by a choice of
effective remedies including the right to bring private legal actions.
Bringing private legal actions would be extremely difficult, however. It
would take a long time to gather the necessary evidence, and the English
courts have no experience in judging such complex economic issues. But
Mercury says the intention is not to overload the courts with lengthy cases.
Rather, it wants a system under which the 'deterrent effect will be
sufficiently strong to replace the existing incentive to abuse market power
until told to stop'.
Mr Heseltine faces some tough choices. The underlying pressure to beef-up
the law on abuse of market power and to bring the UK into line with its
European partners remains. But the government will also be wary of imposing
a heavy new burden of costs on UK industry as it begins to emerge from
recession.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Selection process for Commission jobs
attacked - European Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointments of two directors to the European Commission
Directorate-General for Fisheries have been annulled by the European Court
of First Instance, because the successful applicants were chosen by the
Commission not because of their qualifications but because the EC countries
from which they came were 'owed' the jobs.
The case was brought by two of the unsuccessful applicants for the posts,
who were rejected on the grounds that they were insufficiently qualified in
spite of both having worked on EC fisheries policy. The two successful
applicants were economists from Spain and Italy.
The Court found that the two previous holders of the posts had been Spanish
and Italian and that, in spite of advertising the jobs openly, the
Commission had already decided who the new directors would be before the
applications of the other candidates had been considered properly.
The case brings into the open the political nature of the selection
procedure for Commission jobs. It is hoped the Court's judgment will lead to
greater transparency in Commission appointments.
T-58/91: Booss and Fischer v Commission, CFI 4CH, March 3 1993.
Luxembourg birth and maternity allowances discriminatory
The European Court last week upheld an action brought by the Commission
against Luxembourg for imposing discriminatory rules for the grant of birth
and maternity allowances.
Under Luxembourg law, ante-natal allowances were payable to pregnant women
on condition that they were legally domiciled in Luxembourg and post-natal
allowances were payable on condition that one of the parents of the child
had been legally domiciled in Luxembourg for at least one year at the time
of the birth. Maternity allowances were also available for any pregnant
woman or mother legally domiciled in Luxembourg.
The Court ruled both types of allowance were social security benefits under
EC law and thus should be capable of being enjoyed by both migrant as well
as purely national workers.
The Luxembourg government argued that the rules were not discriminatory
because they applied to both Luxembourg nationals and nationals from other
EC states. The Court rejected that argument, as it found that the conditions
were more easily fulfilled by a Luxembourg national than a national from
another member state.
C-111/91: Commission v Luxembourg, ECJ FC, March 10 1993.
Belgian environmental legislation in breach of EC law
The European Court has ruled Belgium in breach of EC environmental laws on
air quality norms for nitrogen dioxide.
The EC legislation sets certain limits for the amount of nitrogen dioxide in
the air. These limits can be reduced by individual Community countries, but
only after consultation with bordering states which may be affected by lower
limits.
The legislation also obliges member states to consult one another in the
event of a pollution incident which results, or is likely to result, in the
limits being ex-ceeded; to keep the Commission informed of any
consultations; and to give it the opportunity to participate.
Belgium implemented all the legislation except for the provisions relating
to the consultations. The Belgian government submitted that these provisions
did not need to be implemented as Belgium did not envisage taking any action
which would lead to the consultation procedure being opened.
The Court rejected that argument. The provisions relating to the
consultation procedure were an indispensable element of the legislation.
Failure to implement such provisions constituted a breach of Community law,
in that Belgium had failed to implement fully the EC legislation as
requested.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Outside advice - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An independent survey commissioned by City lawyers Taylor Joynson Garrett of
Britain's top 1,000 companies shows that 68 per cent are using more or the
same amount of legal advice from outside law firms this year compared with
1992.
In-house legal departments are still contracting, however, with 53 per cent
of companies saying they would be employing the same number or fewer
in-house lawyers this year. Lawyers working in medium-sized companies with
smaller legal departments are particularly at risk, with 15 per cent of
companies in this category expecting to make cuts in their in-house legal
teams in 1993.
The survey also showed that 20 per cent of the top 1,000 companies had
recently taken advice on corporate recovery matters, and that 10 per cent
had sought advice on issues connected with the future viability of their
businesses or part of them. The companies all agreed that law firm fees were
'very high', but that cost was only the fifth most important factor when
choosing legal advisers. Specialist expertise came top.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: High cost of failure to carry out
reforms - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Commission, the UK government's law reform body, complained last
week that government failure to implement its proposals for reform,
particularly in the area of property law, was costing the UK millions of
pounds in unnecessary legal fees and court costs. More than half of the
40-plus reports produced by the commission since 1984 remain either under
consideration or unimplemented. This is in sharp contrast to 20 years ago.
Of the 30 law reform reports submitted to the government between 1966 and
1973, 28 were implemented in an average time of two years.

THE HACKER CRACKDOWN by Bruce Sterling Viking Pounds 16.99, 328 pages
ONE CAN appreciate the fun. You are hunched over the computer in your
bedroom, while Mom and Dad are relaxing downstairs in front of the other
kind of screen. You are hooked up to the telephone for hours, but it is not
costing a cent because the first call you make is to the phone company's
billing computer to tell it to forget the charges. Routine stuff; but then,
after hours of trying different numbers and different passwords - you hit it
big.
Pages and pages of telephone numbers and switching codes scroll down your
screen. This is no junk. The computer sending it is in the telephone command
centre. It thinks you are a supervisor and waits, like Aladdin's slave, to
do your order. So what? Well, how about this for a crazy thing? You re-route
everyone who dials the Palm Beach County Probation Department (in Delray
Beach, Florida) to Tina in New York State. She sells them pornographic
phone-sex.
Then you call up a bulletin board (a dial-up computer used as a message
centre by fellow crazies) to tell them, and particularly the Legion of Doom,
what a smart-ass you are. You sign on as Fry Guy, like usual. The other
phone phreaks, they laugh good. They say (but you disbelieve them) that they
have pulled many smarter raps. Then you go buy pizza.
Unfortunately, some people who read your message are not so completely
amused. They write it all down in spiral notebooks and then ask some even
less humorous guys: what kind of a perv would connect citizens who need the
Miami probation service to an East Coast phono-tart? And they say, maybe his
next little joke will be to call up some goddam computer and tell it to fire
a cruise missile at Wall Street . . .
So, a few months later, you are engaged in amusing converse with the Legion
in your bedroom when all the house doors are burst open by men with guns.
'You Fry Guy?', they say. 'Place your hands on your head and move real slow
away from that machine.' Mom and Dad say this is unbelievable.
But it happened. Fry Guy, a 16-year-old schoolboy who also admitted
infiltrating the MacDonald's payroll computer to give two of his friends a
raise, was convicted on May 31 1990, and put on probation.
The case thoroughly alarmed the US federal authorities. It showed that a
teenager with the simplest computer and a phone line could penetrate the
innermost fastnesses of the telecommunications network and re-program the
computers that control it. What mischief could he then do] Calls diverted or
monitored, accounts changed at will, telephone numbers deleted, altered or
created out of thin air; all this and more was within the grasp of the
hackers - and that 'more' was the ability to wipe out the whole telephone
system, including emergency services, for hours - possibly days.
Bruce Sterling has done a good job in describing the authorities' crackdown
since then on a group of hackers with sinister names, such as Legion of
Doom, Prophet, Urvile and Leftist, whose fun, it seemed, was becoming far
beyond a joke.
During the 1970s and early 1980s, the US authorities had been more tolerant
of computer pranksters. One reason was that they refused to believe that the
network of thousands of academic, defence and company computers linked by
global telecommunications could be penetrated seriously by outsiders.
Intrusions were difficult to detect, and any that were discovered seemed to
do relatively little damage. Even when hackers were using telephone lines
without paying, the 'theft' of time from the network seemed rather abstract.
However, by the mid-1980s, as home computers became more sophisticated, some
spectacular break-ins were occuring. By far the best account is in Clifford
Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg, which explains how a German hacker hijacked the
international telecommunications system and broke into high security
computers all over the US, including one at the Pentagon.
Sterling tells the story of a concerted counter-move by the authorities. In
Operation Sundevil, during three days in May 1990, 40 computers were seized
with some 23,000 floppy disks containing, stolen passwords and credit card
numbers, programmes and logs of information exchanged by hackers over the
network.
Sterling, unlike Stoll, shows some sympathy for the more 'responsible'
hackers (ie those doing it as an intellectual game rather than with criminal
intent), but he acknowledges that the line is difficult, if not impossible,
to draw. He also explores libertarian issues, such as the damage caused by
the security services to innocent computer users.
This is an interesting but uneven book, in which fascinating facts are
sometimes padded out with generalisations and a bit too much discussion of
issues. A newcomer to the field should start with Stoll's superb 'whodunnit'
of cyberspace. Sterling is better than adequate in explaining what happened
next.

stays out in the cold

<TEXT>
THE INSIDERS by Judi Bevan Piatkus Books Pounds 14.99, 385 pages
GOLDSCAM by Peter Miller Lindsay Ross Publishing Pounds 14.99, 430 pages
WITH THE end of the Cold War dealing a terrible blow to the conventional
spy-thriller, publishers are searching for a new genre. What other
professions can furnish the spy's best-selling combination of exotic
locations, high living, beautiful women, skulduggery, dirty tricks, esoteric
jargon and the sense of being on a secret inside track behind the headlines?
FT readers will know the answer.
Enter the 'Financial Thriller'. Surely international business is the very
stuff of unputdownable drama - or ought to be. But it is not working: there
is no sign of the Deighton or the Le Carre, even the Ludlum or the Follett,
of the tombstone and the blue chip. The two latest examples are depressing
confirmation of my point.
Judi Bevan gives us the sad story of Jack Armstrong of Butler's Biscuits, an
ultra-ambitious MD of the mid-1980s and a financial innocent who ventures
into the City to launch a mega takeover bid where he is out of his depth in
the world of concert parties, insider trading, smooth merchant bankers,
share support indemnities - that sort of thing.
Bevan is a financial journalist and her book can no doubt be read as a roman
a clef, though she is careful to provide walk-on parts for Seelig, Saunders,
Ronson, Halpern, and all the rest of the '80s crew. There has never been a
novel in which the FT was more frequently quoted (and my Lex colleagues so
taken in vain). The detail, whether of Savoy lunches or the changing figures
on the Topic screen, will have its own fascination for many FT readers.
Goldscam relies on the same verisimilitude of detail. Here's a
geologist/consultant with a Midas touch recruited to help a South African
mining house move offshore. Peter Miller all too evidently knows his
Southern Africa and also this world of orebodies in which the central scam
distinguishes between 'parts per million' and 'ounces per ton'.
But there's no way to evade the point . . . You can't write a Financial
Thriller if you can't write.
Judi Bevan may be a competent financial journalist but - I'm sorry - she's
not a novelist. Peter Miller may well be a brilliant metals analyst but he's
no Joseph Conrad, nor Nadine Gordimer either. Bevan and Miller are
adequately convincing in their own fields but they both insist on writing
about things like sex, in which they are both cringe-makingly appalling.
Takeover bids are eminently suitable subjects for a novel; sex - and love -
are more difficult, as the world's better novelists know.

ideas
</HEADLINE>

   By PRABHU GUPTARA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOM PETERS has been the most popular (if also most controversial) management
guru through these difficult times, and his Recession As Opportunity: Smart
Moves for Tough Times (Euromanagement, Pounds 745) is a straight recording
of his 1991 lecture on the subject. So why issue it a year later and - more
to the point - why review it in 1993? Because business conditions have not
changed and because what he had to say then is no less relevant now.
This recession is unlike previous recessions, Peters thinks, in that, even
after the economy picks up, intense global competition will be here to stay.
His recipe for surviving, and even profiting, from this recession is
therefore six-fold.
First, redouble employee involvement and continuous improvement. Second,
inculcate trust through the asymmetrical distribution of pain - that is, job
losses, salary cuts or bonus cuts (as and where relevant) must be most
severe at the top of the corporation and gradually less severe as one moves
down towards ordinary workers. Third, improve and speed up stakeholder
involvement. Fourth, keep up the attack on ensuring that you have
world-class manufacturing. Fifth, the battleground for the 1990s is speed
and the problem is that if you lose this battle you do not have a chance of
ever catching up. Lastly, increase your professional development and
advertising budget.
You can see why Peters is controversial. Even if you disagree with him,
however, you cannot deny that he makes you think - which is not something
that can be said for all so-called gurus. I continue to carp, however, at
straight videoing of lectures. Whether the perorations are given by gurus or
by others, the medium militates against the form. If business videos are to
be anything more than home-movies, they must accomplish something more than
simply record.
*****
A pack that tries to accomplish more is Market-led Strategic Change (NPC
Associates, Pounds 750). Nigel Piercy can be equally fresh and uncomfortable
in what he has to say about how to introduce and drive such change through
an organisation; there is at least a presenter with whom there is some
interaction, and there are various bits of drop-in footage. Why, then, is
the video ineffective as video? Principally because Piercy allowed himself
to work with a video-team who did not understand his message sufficiently,
or perhaps did not have the clout to put it across effectively. The result
is that Piercy's presentation style may be terrific in person, but is less
effective on screen.
That is not to detract from the importance of what he has to say and,
fortunately, the rest of the pack more than makes up for this weakness: it
includes his widely-praised book on the subject, the Trainer's Manual is
good and the Worksheet Manual (consisting of Diagnostic, Implementation

GLIMPSES OF HEAVEN, VISIONS OF HELL by Barrie Sherman and Phil Judkins
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 12.99, 224 pages
VIRTUAL WORLDS: A JOURNEY IN HYPE AND HYPER-REALITY by Benjamin Woolley
Blackwell Pounds 16.95, 274 pages
JUST BEFORE Samuel Taylor Coleridge fell asleep to create the Kubla Khan, he
was browsing in a devotional book, Purchas his Pilgrimage. He read: 'What if
a man should sleep, and in that sleep should dream, and in that dream should
go to paradise. And what if he should be given a flower as a token that he
had really been there? And what if he should wake with that flower in his
hand? Aye, and what then?'
Two hundred years on, the answer is Virtual Reality - the potential to
create any world while staying in this one. John Walker, founder of
Autodesk, the Californian software company, puts it succinctly: 'When you
are interacting with a computer, you are not conversing with another person.
You are exploring another world.'
This other world, Virtual Reality (VR), comes from a computer-based
technology which gives the illusion of immersion in an artificial world, or
of presence in a remote location in the physical world. State-of-the-art VR
enables you to move around in the computer-generated environment and
interact with it. It is interactive, intensive, immersive, illustrative and
intuitive.
VR became commercially available in March 1991 before being academically
understood. The machine evolved faster than the legal or moral concepts it
required. It has spawned a clutch of histories and interpretations, the film
Lawnmower Man (March 1992) and Howard Rheingold's fine book Virtual Reality
(1991) prominent among them.
Now two books, Glimpses of Heaven, Visions of Hell: Virtual Reality and its
Implications, and Virtual Worlds, show a broadening response to VR. The
former is as bullish as the latter bearish. But both agree that VR is
morally and legally still unhatched; that technologically it is a fledgling;
and that, commercially, it is ready to leave the nest.
Morally, VR offers the difficulty of what appears to be another
consciousness, created at will, out of our own, which interacts with ours.
What happens now, when consciousness is no longer an inward domain but out
there, made palpable?
Technologically, the three essentials are already in place. To create the
virtual world visually, you need either a stereographic helmet containing
miniature televisions sending images to each eye, or stereo cameras, or a
wrap-around screen. To instruct the computer, you need a 'dataglove',
joystick or 'mouse' that allows the computer to plot your position and
respond when you grasp a virtual object in the virtual world. To run the
whole 'reality engine', you need a string of computers.
Commercially, there are five players in the VR game: manufacturers (VPL
Research); industry users (Boeing, British Aerospace); researchers (the
University of North Carolina, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
University of Salford); arcade games and software companies (W Industries);
and assorted lawyers, artists and philosophers. But the rush for market
share is just starting.
Glimpses of Heaven is a brisk, positive book, chancily argued but written
with brio and excitement. There is a dodgy chapter on why women, heretofore
supposed to be incompatible with computers, will fare better in an intuitive
and metaphoric world, a kind of computemancipation, and some airy social
theory on VR re-entry problems, underclasses, and new forms of labour.
But the book's strength is its free play of intelligence. It asks simple
questions. Is it a bad thing to get what you want, albeit virtually? If this
is bad, do legislators have the right to prevent others from having it? What
happens when VR crosses national boundaries? Who owns the 'virtual space'
between people immersed in the technology?
In contrast, Virtual Worlds finds a scepticism born of Woolley's long
contact with the hypes and hopes of VR. This is a serious collection of
stimulating essays on the philosophical questions raised by VR. If Galileo
was right to see the universe as a book written in mathematics, Woolley
asks, what can be reduced to maths? Of that, what is computable?
There is a wonderful chapter on parallel universes. Here, we do not know
which one of an infinity of universes we might be in until it happens. Then
you discover you are in the 'my bridesmaid/girlfriend has run off with the
best man' world, and no other.
AT the moment, VR is still crude in effect. The last thing you think of
during VR immersion is reality. But virtual realities are real in our
reaction with them, not in what they are. Computer guru Jaron Lanier
believes it is not the idea of artificial reality that is strange but the
idea of reality itself. Coleridge should be told there is now a VR-related
project called Xanadu. He would turn in his sleep.

FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (29): Guruship in context
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILF ALTMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT GURUS by Andrzej A Huczynski Routledge, Nov. 92, Pounds 19.99,
352 pages
WHY DID the 19805 generate such vast interest in new management ideas and in
the gurus who propounded them at conferences and seminars, in books,
newsletters, videos and cassettes? What makes a management guru?
The author of this well-researched book puts guruship into its historic
context and shows the relationship between demand - as organisations become
larger and more complex - and the diversity of supply.
The trend probably began 100 years ago, with F W Taylor, the 'Father' of
scientific management, and other pioneers like Fayol, Mayo and Maslow. In
the seventies and eighties, Ted Levitt revolutionised managements' views of
marketing and more recently Peters &amp; Waterman's In Search of Excellence has
had a powerful impact.
The author, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow's Business
School, groups six 'families' of popular management ideas or specialisms,
such as scientific management and human relations, each of which produced
its own gurus. Management ideas and their values, he argues, stem from the
originator's position, or involvement, whether in academic research, or
consultancy or experience of management. At the top of the hero-manager
category, according to Fortune's list of best-selling books in the US
1979-1988, we find Lee Iacocca's autobiography, followed by Peters &amp;
Waterman's In Search of Excellence and Trump on The Art of The Deal.
This is a useful step by step guide for those who aim to achieve guru
status, as more aspirants at business schools, in business journalism and in
industry seem likely to. But where are the latterday gurus able to help
companies cope with the turmoil of recession and survival and the aftermath?

THE FINANCIAL TIMES ON MANAGEMENT edited by Christopher Lorenz and Nicholas
Leslie FT/Pitman Pounds 25, 232 pages
I FIND it extraordinary that so few financial journals or business pages
follow developments in the art of management itself, in spite of the fact
that it is obvious that the difference between successful companies and
their less successful brethren lies in the skills and abilities of their
management.
There is no lack of advice to the manager. There was a time when I could,
and did, read almost every new management book as it appeared, but it is
impossible to do so today. The Financial Times Management Page has long been
required reading for me because of my continuing fascination with the study
of management, and it is also something that I look forward to each week.
Like most practising managers I have little empathy with the 'instant
solution merchants.' Every management problem is unique; in my experience
there is never a single solution. In the ideal company, management is
ultimately about the concerns and efforts of groups of people working
together to achieve a common goal. The skill of the manager lies in making
the choices which lead to success.
The Financial Times Management Page is invaluable. It features factual
reports on what a variety of managers are actually doing. Moreover, it sets
these reports in both an international and a financial context. It therefore
acts as a sort of look-out, scanning the horizon and alerting us to what
others are thinking and doing.
One seldom reads an article without it jogging some internal response. The
Management Page does not set out to tell you what to do - rather it sets out
to tell you what others are doing and the successes or difficulties they
have encountered.
As a regular reader I had not expected that Financial Times on Management
would provide me with new perspectives since, apart from new commentaries,
it relies largely on reprinting articles published during the past two
years. However, I was wrong. I now realise that, as well as reading and
mentally noting the articles, I could have gained a lot by filing them under
various headings and re-reading them from time to time.
The sub-title - 'grappling with change and uncertainty' - says it all. The
only certainty for the future is uncertainty, and the sure knowledge that we
are all going to have to cope with unpredictable change at an ever
accelerating rate. Change can be either a threat or an opportunity - and it
is a cruel exposer of management inadequacies. By the use of many examples
the book underlines the need continually to change and adjust to these
forces and clearly shows the fate of those who fail to be flexible in their
thinking and strategies. Dealing with change is not simple, and it only
works if the culture is changing in harmony with the organisational or
operating concepts.
The introduction sets out 12 messages, illustrated throughout the book. The
responsibility of the manager is to select the particular ones needed by his
organisation, and then to transfer the ownership of such ideas to his
people. Despite the complexity of business situations and the need for
tolerance of ambiguity and differences of approach, the manager can only
cope with a very small number of objectives at a time. Business messages
have to be made simple if they are to be believed and acted upon, but they
also have to be consistent and sustained if they are to result in action.
The book demonstrates clearly the dynamic nature of business management and
the fate of those who believe that there is a safe haven where they can rest
and 'consolidate.' The increasing trends towards globalisation and the
enabling power of the computer age have produced yet another pressure on
business, this time for speed of reaction. Time has always cost money, but
lack of speed of change in a company can often lead to a fatal loss of
competitive advantage. It is now essential not only to know where you want
to go and what you want to do, but to do it faster than your competitors.
If I have a criticism it is that, in spite of the efforts to encompass the
needs of small businesses, there is not enough reference to the special
opportunities and difficulties they face. More than 80 per cent of our
businesses are small, and they employ the majority of people in the UK.
Small businesses face many of the problems of the large, without the
resources to cover mistakes, as well as having a vast array of unique
difficulties of their own. Our future national economic success is heavily
dependent upon the ability of small businesses to fight their corner against
the best in the world. They need all the help they can get.
Good managers are constantly seeking to improve their skills and always
looking at the practical experience of others for ideas they can emulate, or
warnings of pitfalls to be avoided. The Financial Times on Management
contains plenty of both and, thanks to the paper's ubiquitous coverage of
the business world, it culls its examples from every country and every type
of industry. It is essential reading for us all.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: CRA makes hostile bid for Cail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COAL and Allied Industries (Cail) is likely to wait two weeks before
responding to a hostile ADollars 11.50-a-share takeover offer from CRA, the
Australian mining group, Mr Tony Haraldson, managing director, said
yesterday.
Mr Haraldson said directors would seek an independent valuation of the
company before responding to the offer, which values Cail at ADollars 716m
(USDollars 511m). CRA owns 40.4 per cent of Cail following a ADollars 7.85 a
share offer in March 1991, and the purchase of a further 2.9 per cent stake
yesterday morning.
The offer is conditional on approval by Australia's Foreign Investment
Review Board because CRA is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Pacific Dunlop sees brighter
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Dunlop, the Australian industrial and food group, yesterday
announced a 14 per cent increase in net profits to ADollars 121m (USDollars
86m) for the first half to the end of December, on sales up 11.6 per cent to
ADollars 3.2bn.
Mr John Gough, chairman, said the group was 'over the worst of the
recession', and forecast that full-year profits would increase
'significantly'. The group maintained the dividend at 10.5 cents, 55 per
cent franked.
Pacific Dunlop said sales increased in all its Australian operations, which
range from fashion clothing and processed food to packaging, automotive
products and telecommunications cables.
The Petersville Sleigh food division, acquired in 1991 from the Adelaide
Steamship group and renamed Pacific Brands Food, increased earnings before
interest and tax by 45 per cent to ADollars 29m.
The group said its international medical and battery businesses accounted
for 38 per cent of profits and 33 per cent of turnover, compared with 29 per
cent and 31 per cent in the comparable period of the previous year.
Mr Gough said the group was reaping the benefits of restructuring and
rationalisation in the previous two years. He said a tentative upturn in
demand for industrial products was being matched by a strengthening in
retail demand, but profit margins remained under pressure.
Mr Gough said trading conditions remained difficult.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Packer pays ADollars 49m for 5%
stake in Fairfax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NINE Network, the Australian television group controlled by Mr Kerry Packer,
yesterday revealed that it paid ADollars 49.7m (USDollars 35.5m) for a 4.98
per cent stake in John Fairfax Holdings, the newspaper group controlled by
Mr Conrad Black.
The announcement prompted speculation that Mr Packer was planning a bid for
Fairfax, which owns the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial
Review and The (Melbourne) Age.
However, the re-election on Saturday of Australia's Labor government means
there is little prospect of a change in the law regulating cross-media
shareholdings, which would be required before Mr Packer could bid.
The conservative opposition coalition had indicated that it might change the
law, which prevents broadcasting operators from acquiring shareholdings of
more than 15 per cent in newspaper groups.
If he wished to bid for Fairfax, Mr Packer would have to dispose of his
controlling 38 per cent shareholding in Nine Network, which would free him
from the cross-media ownership restrictions.
Mr Packer sought to take a 15 per cent stake in Fairfax when it was acquired
in 1991 by a consortium led by Mr Black, chairman of Hollinger, the Canadian
media group and proprietor of the UK Telegraph group. He was forced to
withdraw from the consortium after widespread criticism of his prominent
role in the Australian media threatened the success of Mr Black's bid.
Nine Network said it had bought the Fairfax shares as an 'attractive
investment'. There were no 'current plans' to increase the shareholding.
Nine Network also announced a 1.3 per cent increase in net profit to
ADollars 39m for the six months to the end of December. The board declared
an interim dividend of 7 cents, fully franked, compared with nil last year.
The board said Mr Packer would resign as chairman, as previously announced.
He will be replaced by Mr Bruce Gyngell, who was head of TV-AM, the former
British television broadcaster.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Westpac to reduce costs by
cutting 2,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC, the troubled Australian bank, yesterday said it planned to make
2,000 staff redundant as part of a restructuring of retail operations
intended to cut operating costs by ADollars 150m (USDollars 107m) a year.
Mr Robert Joss, managing director, said most of the staff in question would
leave over the next three months as the retail business was split into
separate consumer and commercial divisions.
'This new structure will enable us to better serve the different needs of
our business and household customers, and presents an important step forward
in making Westpac the best retail bank in Australia,' he said.
The announcement, which was expected, comes in the wake of a wide-ranging
review of Westpac operations following a record loss of ADollars 1.5bn for
the year to the end of September.
The bank announced last week that it planned to dispose of many of its Asian
operations, and consolidate its US operations into one office, as part of a
restructuring of international activities.
Mr David Morgan, head of retail banking, said the redundancies would raise
the bank's retail productivity to world class levels, but would not affect
customer service.
Westpac said last year that it would probably make up to 4,000 of its 20,000
staff redundant in an attempt to reduce its higher than average expenses to
income ratio.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Adsteam provision leads to
ADollars 61m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADSTEAM group of companies, formerly controlled by Mr John Spalvins,
announced substantial losses yesterday, indicating that interest costs and
falling property prices continue to plague the group.
Adelaide Steamship, formerly the group's flagship, announced a net loss of
ADollars 61m (USDollars 43.5m) for the six months to the end of December,
compared with a loss of ADollars 69m for the comparable period of the
previous year.
The company said earnings before interest and tax rose 23 per cent to
ADollars 241m, while financing costs fell 13 per cent to ADollars 290m.
However, the deficiency in shareholders' funds grew by 13 per cent to
ADollars 620m.
Mr George Haines, managing director, said the result included an abnormal
loss of ADollars 107.8m, mostly related to provisions against the value of
the group's UK property portfolio, held through Markheath, a 61 per cent
subsidiary.
'Adsteam directors have deemed it prudent to make a one-off full provision
against the group's Markheath involvement,' Mr Haines said. Mark-heath's
discussions with its banks were 'proceeding constructively'.
Other companies in the group also fared badly. David Jones, the up-market
retailer, lost a net ADollars 59m, compared with ADollars 53m, and Tooth and
Co, the industrial group, lost a net ADollars 58m, compared with ADollars
40.5m.
The bright spot was Industrial Equity (IEL), owned by Adelaide Steamship,
David Jones and Tooth, which re-ported an improvement in net profit to
ADollars 79m from ADollars 27m.
IEL said the improvement would have been larger but for the ADollars 19m
cost of deferring the flotation of its Woolworths supermarket subsidiary,
and ADollars 6.4m in other abnormal charges.

FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Warning over Indonesian banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S listed banks have mostly announced an increase in pre-tax
profits for 1992, although bankers warn the sector remains poorly regulated
and burdened by non-performing debt.
Of the six largest listed banks, five improved on their 1991 performance.
Pre-tax profits at Bank Internasional Indonesia (BII) rose 62.4 per cent to
Rp122.1bn (Dollars 59m), while Lippobank's increased to Rp53.6bn from
Rp24.6bn a year earlier.
Bank Danamon's pre-tax profits rose from 11 per cent to Rp51bn, Bank Bali's
increased from 17.6 per cent to Rp84.1bn, and Bank Niaga's grew 12 per cent
to Rp36.5bn. Bank Duta was alone in seeing a pre-tax profit fall from
Rp35.9bn in 1991 to Rp26.2bn last year. In a year of general consolidation
in the Indonesian banking sector, which remains dominated by five
state-owned banks, the growth in the listed banks' outstanding loans either
slowed or, in two instances, was reversed.
Bank Danamon's loan portfolio grew most rapidly to Rp3,600bn from Rp2,950bn
in 1991, while Lippobank's loans rose 17.5 per cent to Rp2,150bn.
Bank Bali and Bank Duta posted a marginal fall in outstanding loans, down 7
per cent to Rp1,960bn and 4.5 per cent to Rp1,700bn respectively.
Brokers say the banks are more bullish for growth next year. BII forecast a
50 per cent loan growth this year, after an 8 per cent rise to Rp3,680bn in
1992.
Lippobank and Bank Bali are forecasting loan growth in excess of 20 per
cent, while Bank Niaga is anticipating a more modest 15 per cent rise. The
government has forecast a 17 per cent rise in banking sector credit this
year.
Brokers, however, warn that higher net profits and an increase in credit may
flatter the banks' actual performance. The results need to be accompanied by
a now-perennial warning that banks may be under-provisioning for
non-performing assets, they say.
Banks should be providing a minimum of 2.3 per cent of productive assets for
non-performing assets, brokers say, but they believe that none of the listed
banks reaches this figure.
In the worst case, brokers estimate that one of the six is providing less
than 1 per cent of its productive assets. An increase in provisions to 2.3
per cent would wipe out twice-over the bank's 1992 net profits.
Banks anticipating high credit growth this year will also need to watch
their capital adequacy ratios. Brokers estimate all the six listed banks to
have capital adequacy ratios in excess of 7 per cent of risk weighted
assets, a level set by the central bank for the end of this month.
But if the banks meet their targets for credit growth, most will need to
raise new capital by the end of the year.
Brokers say this could lead to a call on shareholders for new finance or
restricted dividend payments to allow banks to retain profits and boost
their capital base.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Gearing surprise as Laporte drops 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAPORTE, the speciality chemicals group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits
down 10 per cent, from Pounds 96.4m to Pounds 86.6m, for the year to January
3.
The shares fell 9p to 676p, as analysts were surprised by the group's
gearing. Although debt at the year end had been Pounds 125.6m, Mr Ken
Minton, chief executive, said during a presentation to analysts that it had
deteriorated since January to about Pounds 190m.
Most of the deterioration - about Pounds 25m - had been caused by adverse
currencies and in particular the rise of the dollar. Debt at Evode, a recent
acquisition, had been higher than expected (Pounds 10m) and the group had
bought about Pounds 8m of Evode's shares during the takeover. A further
acquisition (Pounds 5m) and seasonal changes (Pounds 6m) had added to debt.
Mr Minton said the group would be cash-positive during 1993.
Mr Minton said the results had been in line with predictions and that he
felt pretty good about the prospects for Evode and the group generally.
The results were achieved on turnover down from Pounds 616m to Pounds 608m.
The pre-tax profits included Pounds 9.6m from the Interox business which was
sold on May 21. Sales of Interox until that date were Pounds 74m.
The organic speciality division's operating profits were Pounds 15.8m
(Pounds 4.9m) on turnover up from Pounds 33.6m to Pounds 81.7m thanks to the
acquisition of the peroxy speciality business at Interox. The existing
business increased from Pounds 33.6m to Pounds 41m. The peroxy business
added Pounds 9.4m to the profits.
Sales at the absorbents division increased 12 per cent from Pounds 81m to
Pounds 90.8m, while trading profits rose from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 12.1m.
Mr Minton said the figures masked a distinct improvement in margins during
the second half of the year from 10.7 per cent to 15.9 per cent. The
improvement was due to significant investment and rationalisation.
The construction chemicals division reported operating profits up 69 per
cent from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 17.9m on sales of Pounds 141.1m (Pounds
105.9m). Rockwood, a recent acquisition, generated Pounds 25.7m of the
Pounds 35.2m increase in turnover.
The hygiene and process chemicals division posted trading profits up 14 per
cent from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 16.1m on sales of Pounds 96.3m (Pounds
89.3m). The metals and electronic chemicals division's turnover was up 3 per
cent from Pounds 94.4m to Pounds 97.5m. Operating profits fell 7 per cent
from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 14.2m.
Capital expenditure, which the company described as heavy, was Pounds 74m.
Earnings per share fell 2 per cent from 40p to 39.2p. The board proposed a
final dividend of 12.5p, making a total for the year of 19.5p (18.9p), a
rise of 3 per cent.

With insufficient turnover to make use of its showrooms and ancillary
services 1992 pre-tax losses at William Bedford, the antique dealer and
restorer, increased from Pounds 210,000 to Pounds 272,000.
The USM-quoted company added that unless there was an unforeseen increase in
turnover the present year would again be difficult.
Turnover was Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.63m). Losses per share were 5p (2.6p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigroup, the building materials manufacturer and distributor, lifted
pre-tax profits from Pounds 304,000 to Pounds 466,000 in the six months to
December 31.
The result reflected an upsurge in profits from the timber products division
and also the cessation of activities on the clothing side where an operating
loss of Pounds 122,000 was recorded in the 1991 interim period.
Turnover advanced from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.7m and operating profit
from Pounds 562,000 to Pounds 845,000. Sales in the timber products division
increased from Pounds 4.46m to Pounds 7.71m and operating profits from
Pounds 670,000 to Pounds 797,000.
Earnings per share were up from 0.58p to 1p.

Metalrax Group, the specialist engineer, continued its growth in the year to
December 31 with pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 7.21m to Pounds 7.31m, on

With a higher tax charge of Pounds 2.36m (Pounds 2.27m), earnings per share

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Record Holdings, the maker of hand and bench tools,
plunged from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 1.25m in 1992.
Group turnover increased to Pounds 28.5m (Pounds 26m) with exports up more
than a quarter, while UK sales declined to Pounds 16m, against Pounds 16.2m.
Redundancy costs increased sharply from Pounds 132,000 to Pounds 891,000 as
the group lost more than 100 employees.
It made an exceptional provision of Pounds 395,000 against the cost of
transferring plant from Warrington to Sheffield, which was partly offset by
Pounds 134,000 exceptional profits (losses Pounds 189,000) on disposal of
property in Canada.
The board proposes to hold the final dividend at 2.45p maintaining the total
for the year at 3.6p uncovered by earnings per share of 2.2p, compared with
6.9p last time.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Whitegate Leisure in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED trading, lower interest rates and the disposal of its loss-making
French businesses enabled Whitegate Leisure to return to the black in the
six months to February 28.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 682,000 for the period compared with losses of
Pounds 1.51m last time and a Pounds 3.03m deficit for the 8 months ended
August 31 1992.
Whitegate's core business - mass market leisure in the Midlands and the
north of England - performed better, but turnover was still suffering as a
result of low levels of general economic activity. UK leisure profits rose
to Pounds 3.37m (Pounds 2.3m) on turnover of Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 8.7m).
The USM-quoted company said it continued to offer its healthcare businesses
for sale and considerable interest was being shown. These operations turned
in profits of Pounds 103,000 (Pounds 3,000 losses).
Last year's group losses were after an exceptional charge of Pounds 784,000
for restructuring costs and write down of assets. Interest took Pounds 1.66m
(Pounds 1.98m) and earnings per share were 2.4p (5.6p losses).

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BM poised for losses after heavy
write-downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM Group, the construction equipment and engineering concern, is likely to
fall into the red this year after substantial losses on business disposals
and other write-downs.
The group announced yesterday that it would take an exceptional loss of
about Pounds 13m on the recent sale of Blackwood Hodge UK and Spain to
International Machinery Company.
The share price, which collapsed last summer after the departure of the
chairman Mr Roger Shute, fell 6p to 54p yesterday.
A root-and-branch review has been carried out under the new chairman Mr
Moger Woolley, with the help of a new merchant bank - Robert Fleming has
replaced Hambros - and new auditors - Price Waterhouse for Kingston Smith.
Analysts estimate that exceptional losses could run to Pounds 20m-Pounds
30m. This would push the group into the red even before interest costs on
trading profits thought to be running at Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m for the year
to June 30. Last June net debt stood at Pounds 61.1m.
The interim results have been delayed until April.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: HSBC doubles to Pounds 1.7bn - Strong
growth in Hong Kong and Asia Pacific operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG PROFITS in Hong Kong and the Asia Pacific region helped HSBC Holdings
to raise pre-tax profits by 94 per cent in sterling terms to Pounds 1.7bn
for 1992 compared with Pounds 880m.
The increase expressed in Hong Kong dollars was 56 per cent to HKDollars
20.1bn (HKDollars 12.8bn).
Asia Pacific operations made a Pounds 1.3bn pre-tax profit (Pounds 878m).
They contributed Pounds 430m of the rise in pre-tax profit, helped by an
exceptional profit of Pounds 270m on the sale of a 10 per cent stake in
Cathay Pacific Airways.
The charge for possible bad debts more than doubled to Pounds 1.19bn (Pounds
502m) after taking in Pounds 321m attributable to Midland, Pounds 297m from
Olympia and York, and Pounds 90m from Concord Leasing, Pounds 49.5m of which
relates to shipping loans.
Provisions against Olympia and York now amount to 60 per cent of the Pounds
500.1m exposure. Mr John Bond, chief executive, said it was 'extremely
unlikely that we would take another stand alone position like that in the
future'.
Sir William Purves, chairman, said that although economic growth in Asia had
been robust, recession in several of its markets made 1992 quite a difficult
year and resulted in 'a significant increase in the level of provisioning'.
Sir William said this would be 'a year of consolidation' for Midland. 'The
highest priority is for Midland to get its domestic retail business firing
on all cylinders, and to improve service to customers," he said.
HongkongBank's profit attributable to shareholders after tax and exceptional
items rose to Pounds 1.01bn (Pounds 599m). Hang Seng Bank, in which
HongkongBank has a 61.4 per cent shareholding, contributed Pounds 486m
(Pounds 311m).
Both Marine Midland, the US subsidiary, and HongkongBank of Australia
returned to profit. Marine Midland showed a profit of Pounds 79.3m (Pounds
94.9m loss), while HongkongBank of Australia made a profit of Pounds 3.5m
(Pounds 18.4m loss).
Profits of James Capel, the group's stockbroking subsidiary, fell to Pounds
7.6m (Pounds 17.7m), after restructuring and other charges. European results
were 'disappointing,' while Asia and the US were 'highly profitable'.
Net interest income grew to Pounds 3.34bn (Pounds 1.84bn) and other
operating income grew to Pounds 2.63bn (Pounds 1.2bn).
Despite a rise in operating expenses to Pounds 3.37bn (Pounds 1.78bn) the
cost to income ratio fell to 56.6 per cent (58.4 per cent).
The group's ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets stayed constant at 12.3
per cent, although its tier 1 capital ratio fell to 7.4 per cent (9.6 per
cent).
Its property revaluation reserve under tier 2 capital rose to Pounds 1.05bn
(Pounds 381m).
Earnings per share were 72 per cent up at 62p (36p).
The final dividend is 14.2p, increasing the total to 19p (12.71p).
Shareholders' funds rose to Pounds 8.01bn (Pounds 4.82bn) and assets grew to
Pounds 170.5bn (Pounds 85.79bn). The return on average assets rose to 1 per
cent (0.7 per cent).
HSBC's 75p ordinary shares closed 20p higher at 624p.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Turnround in exceptionals behind 25%
decline at ECC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at English China Clays, the industrial minerals and
construction materials group, fell 25 per cent in 1992 to Pounds 86.2m,
compared with Pounds 115.4m for the previous year.
There was an exceptional charge of Pounds 14.3m, against a credit of Pounds
2.2m, mainly relating to the write down of housing land announced in
September. Group sales fell 4.5 per cent to Pounds 966.3m.
Lord Chilver, chairman, said the European markets were 'unlikely to show
much progress' in 1993, but there were signs of recovery in the US.
He said the group expected to at least maintain the dividend in 1993 at the
1992 level of 20p, itself unchanged from 1991. The shares rose 5p to 458p.
Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said there had been 'intense pressure from
customers for substantial price reductions' as the paper industry, the main
user of china clay, struggled with overcapacity. He said ECC had resisted
and volumes had been maintained.
He said the group was in the middle of a five year programme to change the
company around. 'We have done all the obvious things' he said, such as
cutting costs, selling businesses and sorting out the balance sheet.
The group was now the world's leading supplier of kaolin following the
purchase of Georgia Kaolin in the US, at the end of 1990.
The next step was to seek out business opportunities, such as expanding
sales into the Pacific area, supplied from the US, and developing new uses
for its industrial minerals.
Operating profits from ECC International fell to Pounds 90.5m (Pounds
97.7m), although sales were marginally higher at Pounds 589.8m.
Profits from construction materials, largely hard rock used in road
building, fell to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 24.1m). Sales rose 2.4 per cent to
Pounds 352.4m, as strong volumes were offset by price weakness.
The housebuilding division, now being wound down, contributed Pounds 8.3m
(Pounds 14.3m) in profits, and generated cash of Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 23.8m)
as land was sold. Since 1990 Pounds 52m had been raised from this division,
and the total could reach Pounds 200m.
The interest charge was Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 16.5m) following the Pounds
209.2m rights issue last year. Net debt rose by Pounds 40.3m to Pounds
172.8m, 21 per cent of shareholders funds. The translation of overseas debt
at lower sterling rates added Pounds 45.2m to debt.
Earnings per share fell 30 per cent to 21.87p. An unchanged final dividend
of 13.4p is proposed.
Under FRS 3, which the group will apply to its published accounts, pre-tax
profits rose from Pounds 79m to Pounds 100.2m, mainly because of the
reclassification of an extraordinary profit of Pounds 16m. Earnings per
share were 27.26p, up from 15.09p.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sterling's collapse helps MAI advance by
12% to Pounds 33.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI, the financial services and media group headed by Lord Hollick, the
Labour peer, increased pre-tax profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 33.9m in the
six months to December 31, against Pounds 30.2m.
The core money and security broking business was again the main engine,
accounting for all but Pounds 25m of turnover, which was up 9 per cent at
Pounds 204.5m (Pounds 187.2m). Broking operating profit was up 16 per cent
at Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 18.8m) in what analysts described as peak conditions
with governments worldwide seeking financing for deficits.
With 60 per cent of profits accruing overseas, mostly in dollars, the
company benefited from the sterling crash following 'Black Wednesday' last
September.
Lord Hollick said translation was at an average of Dollars 1.69, compared
with Dollars 1.75 for the 1991-92 year. With the rate now running at about
Dollars 1.43, the benefit would be greater in the second half, he said.
MAI added, however, that profits had been held back by a sharp decline in
foreign exchange activity in the Far East, particularly Japan, where there
was no sign of a sustained improvement.
Meanwhile, Lord Hollick declined to comment on his relations with fellow
directors at Mirror Group Newspapers. He has distanced himself from a recent
statement from the board expressing support for the current management but
refused to be drawn on reports that he might resign. 'I am still a
director,' he said.
He was more forthcoming about Meridian Television, which won the south of
England ITV franchise with a Pounds 36m bid and began broadcasting on
January 1.
He said advertising and audience figures were slightly ahead of target. It
was premature to speak of a sustained upturn in TV advertising, but
prospects seemed good.
MAI is investing Pounds 30m most of which has already been spent, with a
targeted profit for the company in 1994.
Profits increased at the Wagon used car finance company, the mainstay of
retail financial services, despite sluggish motor sales. Analysts said Wagon
had increased its market share and appeared to have overcome the worst of
its bad debt problems. Wagon said it had refinanced more than Pounds 200m of
bank loans on a medium term basis.
Profits in the information side, which includes the NOP market research
organisation, were also well ahead at Pounds 2.1m, compared with Pounds
1.2m, on turnover of Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 22.9m).
The interim dividend is raised to 2p (1.4p) to reduce disparity. Earnings
per share were 6.5p (5.8p).

FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Traffic side bolsters Peek
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PEEK reported pre-tax profits up 18 per cent, from Pounds 6.06m to Pounds
7.13m for 1992, on turnover ahead 6 per cent from Pounds 84m to Pounds
88.8m, despite a setback in its field data business.
The traffic division, which includes systems for junction signals and road
offence monitoring in the US, Europe and the Far East, saw operating profit
rise 75 per cent to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 3.77m). Most of this was
attributable to acquisitions - notably of four companies in Denmark,
Finland, Norway and Sweden - which helped push turnover up 56 per cent to
Pounds 54.1m (Pounds 34.6m).
Results for the field data side declined with sales of Pounds 34.8m (Pounds
49.5m) and operating profit of Pounds 2.12m (Pounds 3.54m). Peek said this
was due to weak performance of Peek Measurement, which produces measuring
equipment for the petrochemical and water industries in Europe.
Earnings per share advanced to 4.2p (3.6p) and an unchanged final dividend
of 2.35p is recommended for a maintained total of 3.4p.
Mr Allen Standley, group managing director, said he was relatively cautious
about 1993, noting there was a reluctance in the present economic climate in
Europe for customers to make commitments to big capital investments such as
traffic systems. He predicted profits growth in single figures this year.
Peek was optimistic, however, about prospects for growth over the next
decade, particularly in 'smart' traffic systems which increase efficiency of
road use. It is looking to expand in the Far East and has negotiated a 41
per cent holding in a control systems company based in Chengdu, China.
Mr Standley said Peek was also planning to concentrate on producing strong
growth in its field data side. This will come through its wholly-owned Husky
computers subsidiary, which last year introduced two new 'rugged' computers
and increased turnover and profits.

FT  16 MAR 93 / General Motors says Lopez finally decides to leave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors announced yesterday that Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
its head of worldwide purchasing, had finally decided to quit GM, apparently
to join Germany's Volkswagen, after a bizarre five days of wavering between
the two companies.
Mr Lopez, one of the best-known figures in the US motor industry, appeared
to have decided over the weekend to remain at GM. The US company even
scheduled a press conference yesterday afternoon to announce this and to say
he had been promoted to executive vice-president of the company and
president of its North American automotive operations.
However, Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, told the news conference that a
friend of Mr Lopez had submitted a letter of resignation from him at
lunchtime yesterday. The letter offered no explanation for his move. Mr
Smith added: 'It is not clear to me what his intentions are or where he is
at the present time.' However, he guessed that Mr Lopez would be joining
Volkswagen with whom he signed a contract of employment last week.
Volkswagen seems likely to announce that Mr Lopez is joining the company
after a meeting today of its supervisory board, which is expected to approve
a management shake-up.
The news could also boost Volkswagen shares, which fell DM7.30 to DM285.50
yesterday when the German company appeared to have failed in its efforts to
poach Mr Lopez.
GM's failure to keep Mr Lopez is a blow to its efforts to slash its car
manufacturing costs in North America, where the company has lost Dollars
12bn (Pounds 8.4bn) over the past two years. Mr Lopez led a team which
demanded big price cuts from parts manufacturers and offered them workshops
to improve their manufacturing techniques.
The reasons for his vacillation and ultimate departure from GM remained
unclear yesterday, though several factors appeared to have played a role.
GM acknowledged that it had sought to keep him last Thursday by offering him
the promotions which were to be announced today. In spite of these new
positions, which would have given him substantial power over all North
American manufacturing operations, Mr Lopez initially decided to join
Volkswagen.
He appeared to change his mind after meetings with members of his purchasing
staff and further weekend discussions with Mr Smith. Mr Lopez had not asked
for anything, but had been weighing up personal considerations.
Mr Smith said Mr Lopez had told him at one point that his family wished to
return to Europe and he had a contract with Volkswagen.
The GM chief executive acknowledged that Mr Lopez, who hails from Spain's
Basque country, had been urging the construction of a plant there using
manufacturing techniques, capable of assembling a car in only 10 hours.
However, GM had decided not to go ahead with such a project at the present
time.

FT  16 MAR 93 / HSBC leaps 94 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings yesterday announced a 94 per cent rise in 1992 pre-tax profits
to Pounds 1.7bn, from Pounds 880m the previous year, following its
acquisition of Midland Bank last July.
The strongest increase in profits came from operations in the Asia Pacific,
which contributed Pounds 1.3bn of pre-tax profit. American operations
incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 24m, while European operations made a
Pounds 303m pre-tax profit.
HSBC disclosed a Pounds 297m provision against its exposure to Olympia &amp;
York, the property developer, and made a Pounds 321m provision on Midland
loans. The O&amp;Y provision amounts to 60 per cent of the bank's Pounds 500.1m
exposure to the company.
The bank's earnings per share rose 72 per cent to 62.07p (36.6p). It
declared a final dividend of 14.2p, making a total of 19p, a 50 per cent
increase on 1991.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Thomas Cook buys 8.4% of Owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS Cook, the German- controlled travel agency, yesterday bought an 8.4
per cent stake in Owners Abroad, the holiday company defending a hostile bid
from rival Airtours.
The purchase may prove to be decisive in ensuring that Owners Abroad retains
its independence, allowing it to progress with its proposed commercial
tie-up with Thomas Cook, and its sister company, LTU, the German tour
operator.
Last night Owners Abroad and Airtours were awaiting the decision of
Gartmore, a 7.6 per cent shareholder in Owners Abroad. The offer closes at
1pm today.
Advisers to Owners Abroad said Thomas Cook had bought the shares from a
variety of institutions at a cost of about Pounds 21m.
Thomas Cook's offer of 152.5p was aimed at investors who were believed
likely to accept the offer, they said.
Gartmore was understood to have sold some of its stake to Thomas Cook.
A spokesman for Gartmore would not comment on whether it planned to to
accept the Airtours offer.
Airtours also yesterday produced new information on the cost savings it
expects to make from a merged Owners and Airtours.
It said it hoped to make Pounds 20m savings in the full 1993-94 financial
year and the same the following year.
These figures compared with Owners Abroad's assessment of benefits from its
tie-up with Thomas Cook of Pounds 9m and Pounds 11m in the two years.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said Pounds 8m of savings would come
from an average 2 per cent saving on the purchasing of bed nights.
A further Pounds 4m saving would come from a car rental deal in the US.
Other savings would come from passenger handling, and economies in running
the two airlines.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, described Airtours statement as a
'a last minute response to a glaring omission in its arguments to date'.
He said Owners' brands had limited overlap with Airtours. Airtours appeared
to have ignored the effect of loss of market share which would occur if its
bid were successful, the company said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James McKinnon, who steps down as director general of the Office of Gas
Supply (Ofgas) in September, could soon pick up his first company
chairmanship. He is replacing Sir Graham Day as deputy chairman of MAI, Lord
Hollick's financial services and media group.
Sir James, 63, one of Britain's more combative regulators, announced last
month that he was retiring a year earlier than planned. Sir James has known
Sir Ian Morrow, who has been chairman of MAI since 1974, since their days
together at the Scottish Institute of Chartered Accountants - of which they
have both been president.
However, Sir Ian has turned 80 and now that Sir Graham has decided to
relinquish the deputy chairmanship of MAI, Sir James, a former finance
director of Imperial Tobacco, would seem a natural successor to the MAI
chair. Sir Graham, chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, remains a non-executive
director of MAI.
John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics, is David
Sainsbury's first non-executive appointment to the board since he took over
as chairman of supermarket chain J Sainsbury last November.
Ashworth says that the directorship 'formalises' a long-standing involvement
with David Sainsbury. Ashworth is a trustee of the Gatsby Charitable
Foundation and the two families have known each other for years. He adds
that, as far as he is aware, the Sainsburys have never given any money to
the LSE.
Knowing 'nothing' about retailing, Ashworth, 54, says he has been recruited
rather for his biological expertise with its application to food science.
Starting out in the department of biochemistry at Leicester University,
Ashworth subsequently became professor of biology at Essex. Before his nine
year stint as vice chancellor of Salford University, he worked at Cabinet
Office as chief scientist in the central policy review staff.
He notes that as a Gatsby trustee he has had a hand in evolving its policy
towards plant science and in helping set up the Sainsbury laboratory which
carries out research into disease resistance in plants.

FT  16 MAR 93 / People: Founder Jones shares out top job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharelink, Europe's largest execution-only stockbroker, has recruited
Richard Fielding (right), former chairman of insurance brokers CE Heath, as
non-executive chairman of the holding company.
Founder David Jones, who had combined the roles of chief executive and
chairman, explains that since last May's management buy-out the company had
said it intended to seek a non-executive chairman. 'It has just taken a long
time to get around to it; we have all been very busy.'
Sharelink has grown rapidly during its six year existence; Jones claims it
now sees up to 10 per cent of all stock market transactions in the UK, with
a market share of 15-20 per cent of the country's private client business.
He is already confident of being able to exceed 'significantly' this year's
budgeted profit of Pounds 2.5m.
Fielding, 59, retired as chairman of CE Heath last July. Having risen to the
position of managing director at the insurance broker in the early 1970s, he
left to form his own company, Fielding Insurance Holdings. The latter was
merged with Heath in 1986. Fielding became group chief executive and
chairman the following year.
Approached for the Sharelink opening by headhunters, Fielding says he had
never been headhunted before and that he 'enjoyed the novelty'. Jones,
meanwhile, reckons his new chairman combines the 'right personal qualities
and style' in addition to having the experience of building a business from
scratch into a large organisation. 'And insurance is not a million miles
from stockbroking - lots of paper, to begin with,' adds Jones.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Rekindling the creative
flame - The decline in Japan's entrepreneurial spirit may have far-reaching
economic consequences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan is facing a crisis of entrepreneurship. The sharp downturn in the
Japanese economy has brought small business confidence close to the lows it
reached at the depths of the 1975 recession caused by the rise in oil
prices.
Small business bankruptcies are about 40 per cent up on a year ago, compared
with about 4 per cent for large companies. Employment in family enterprises
is falling at an annual rate of about 10 per cent a year, compared with a
continued moderate rise in salaried employment at large businesses. This
downturn comes after a lengthy period of stagnation in small business
performance, with declining rates of start-up and falling labour and capital
productivity.
Japanese small companies have been a vital spark of creativity in Japan.
Many of the household names of Japanese manufacturing had their roots in
entrepreneurial companies, founded after the second world war. The Honda
Motor corporation started in a motorbike repair shop and Matsushita, the
largest integrated electrical appliance maker in the world started as a
small components manufacturer.
Small businesses are a vital source of flexibility, acting as
sub-contractors to larger groups. They have also provided employment
stability.
Between 1981 and 1991 the share of employment accounted for by small
companies, employing less then 300 workers, was stable in construction and
real estate and fell marginally in manufacturing, retailing, financial
services, transport and services. About 80 per cent of the Japanese
workforce is employed in small companies.
The stability of small businesses' share of employment in Japan has been one
of the main reasons for the country's low unemployment rate which did not
rise above 3 per cent in the 1980s. But there is mounting evidence that the
economic downturn has hit Japanese small businesses at a time when they were
already running out of steam. A combination of structural factors and the
sharp cyclical downturn means small businesses could be facing a shake out
which could have far-reaching consequences for the economy.
The rate of business start-ups declined from about 7 per cent of all
enterprises in the early 1970s to close to 4 per cent in the late 1980s. The
net rate of business creation, the number of openings minus the number of
business closures, stands at just under 1 per cent, according to official
statistics gathered by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
But even that understates the decline in entrepreneurship. Start-ups by
independent entrepreneurs now account for less than half of new enterprises.
The rest are subsidiaries of large businesses.
Moreover Japan's small businesses have gradually become less dynamic. In
1975 they were 62 per cent as productive as Japan's large companies. In 1990
they were only 50 per cent as productive, according to Miti figures.
One of the main reasons for the fall in labour productivity is that since
the 1970s small businesses have been a vast 'labour-sponge' soaking up
workers displaced from manufacturing companies. These have maintained their
international competitiveness by streamlining their factories.
Now small companies are facing a number of pressures which will force them
to restructure too, making it more difficult for them to soak up labour
which is being shed from larger companies.
As small companies get about 60 per cent of their finance from banks, they
are vulnerable to a more restrictive approach to lending by the banks which
are burdened by mounting bad loans. Banks are taking a more cautious
approach to lending to risky small businesses, after a rapid expansion of
lending in the mid-1980s.
In manufacturing small sub-contractors will feel the brunt of moves by large
companies to cut costs by lengthening product cycles and reducing the number
of model variations. This means manufacturers will need fewer components
made by fewer suppliers. Small businesses in manufacturing are heavily
exposed as about 56 per cent of them are sub-contractors.
Small manufacturers generally make less sophisticated products than large
companies and are thus more vulnerable to mounting competition from rapidly
industrialising low-wage economies. Deregulation in retailing is making it
more difficult for small companies to compete with large groups. Between
1988 and 1991, the number of large retail outlets grew by 9.4 per cent,
compared with a fall of 1.8 per cent in the number of small shops, according
to Miti.
Many small companies are trapped by the rise and fall of Japan's land
prices. The rise in land prices during the speculative bubble economy of the
late 1980s made it difficult for small companies to get started. However,
small businesses which used land holdings as collateral to increase their
borrowing now face a tight financial squeeze. According to Miti's estimates
a 30 per cent fall in land prices would require small businesses to reduce
their outstanding debts by about 27 per cent to maintain a constant ratio of
debt to assets.
Commercial land prices have fallen by between 4 per cent and 20 per cent and
are still falling, according to official surveys. The implication is that
small businesses will have to devote a growing share of their earnings to
paying off debts, rather than investing.
In the short term small businesses' hopes of salvation rest with the
government. Small businesses are a vital source of support for the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party. The government has begun to cushion them against a
credit crunch imposed by the banks restricting their lending.
In February, the Ministry of Finance wielded its influence over the
commercial banks by officially asking them not to refrain from lending to
small businesses.
The government has also increased public lending to small businesses through
the public sector Peoples' Finance Corporation and the Small Business
Finance Corporation.
Bank of Japan statistics show public-sector lending is growing in an attempt
to offset a sharp fall in the growth rate of bank lending to small
companies.
At its height in 1987, commercial bank lending to small businesses grew by
18.7 per cent, while the Small Business Finance Corporation's lending
contracted by 3.3 per cent. However, since 1990 the roles have been
reversed. In 1990 commercial bank lending to small business grew by 11 per
cent but public lending rose by almost 20 per cent. In June last year public
lending was rising at an annual rate of about 8 per cent, while commercial
lending was growing at only 1.3 per cent.
Yet the government will be less able to offset the slowdown in commercial
bank lending than it was during past downturns. The rise in private-sector
lending to small businesses in the 1980s means they are now more heavily
dependent upon the banks. In 1983 public sector lending to small businesses
was worth about 25 per cent of bank lending, but by last year this figure
was only 13 per cent of the bank's outstanding loans.
Moreover, the rise in public-sector lending will do nothing to relieve the
longer term problems - intensifying competition from the rest of Asia,
weaker relationships with their main Japanese clients, sluggish domestic
demand and weak balance sheets.
The waning of the entrepreneurial spirit is becoming a source of official
concern. The government has just begun to address what could prove to be a
prolonged period of restructuring. A recent Miti report on small businesses
said: 'Considering the major contribution made by active business opening to
boosting the country's industrial vigour, the decline in new start-ups,
especially by individual entrepreneurs has come to a point where we really
need to worry about its grave consequences for the future of the Japanese
economy.'

The Management Charter Initiative, set up to improve the performance of the
UK's managers, has launched a campaign to spread best practice in the field
of small business initiatives.
The Managing for Growth campaign comprises the publication of recent
research into small business problems, seminars and consultancy help. The
aim is to ensure small business organisations do not 're-invent the wheel'
but will be able to obtain information on schemes which are already working.
Among early examples of good practice identified by the MCI are a programme
which provides high-level women managers as role models for their
counterparts in small and medium-sized businesses and secondments of
unemployed large company managers to small businesses.

<TEXT>
A two-pronged attack on the European Commission and on its directorate
general for enterprise (DG23), for failing to do enough for small
businesses, has been made by Ann Robinson, head of policy at the Institute
of Directors.
The commission has failed to take into account the needs of small and
medium-sized firms in devising the rules for the single market, while DG23
has proved a disappointment in defending their interests, she told an IOD
small business conference in Belfast.
'The rules of single market appear to have been designed for big business
and bureaucrats,' she said. 'Some of the most burdensome regulations for
small firms have passed through the council of ministers without so much as
a peep from DG23.'

FT  16 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Cutting support for
consultancy - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to cut subsidies for the Enterprise Initiative Consultancy
Scheme, which provides consultancy help in fields such as marketing, quality
and design, Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said.
Support will be reduced from two-thirds to half of the cost to businesses in
assisted and urban programme areas and from half to one third of the cost
elsewhere, with effect from March 24.
When the consultancy scheme ends, as planned, in March 1994, it will be
replaced with a programme delivered locally through 'one-stop shops' and
Training and Enterprise Councils, Heseltine said last week in a written
answer to a parliamentary question.
The new programme will consist of a diagnostic service, a consultancy
brokerage and continuation 'in some form' of consultancy support and
technology-related advice.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Technology: Big science on the back burner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outlook has never been more uncertain for what were supposed to be the
two biggest US science projects of the 1990s: the Dollars 30bn (Pounds
20.9bn) space station and an Dollars 8bn atom smasher, the superconducting
super collider.
Although President Clinton favours both, many observers believe his
commitment is far from wholehearted. They doubt whether he would invest much
political capital in trying to save either project in the face of intense
pressure from congressional budget-cutters.
According to John Gibbons, the new White House science adviser, big science
projects may have been given too much urgency 'compared with other
priorities in terms of our national recovery and putting in place an
investment strategy for future economic progress'.
The Clinton administration's proposal for the SSC is to persevere with the
existing plans to build the world's largest particle accelerator in an 86km
tunnel beneath the plains of Texas, but to postpone the 1998 completion date
by at least two years in the hope of defining more closely the complex
equipment required and attracting international partners.
European nations will not contribute because they prefer to invest in their
own accelerator at Cern, Geneva. Asian countries have resisted US requests
to join the SSC and, even if Japan succumbs, foreign contributions are
unlikely to come close to the Dollars 1.7bn originally expected.
There is no question about the SSC's scientific value, says Gibbons:
'They're trying to solve some eternal questions about the nature of matter.'
By recreating on a small scale the conditions of the early universe soon
after the Big Bang, physicists hope to gain a new understanding of
fundamental forces and particles.
But cynics suggest Clinton's support for SSC may be more closely related to
shoring up his reputation in Texas, where there is an election in May for
the Senate seat vacated by Lloyd Bentsen, than to his interest in the
origins of the universe.
In the case of the space station Freedom, Clinton has told Nasa to undertake
a complete redesign to cut costs, currently estimated at Dollars 31bn. 'We
want to take a fresh look at this and not just take the existing station and
start peeling away the pieces,' said Daniel Goldin, Nasa administrator.
The space station has suffered several scaling-down exercises since
President Reagan initiated the project in 1984, with the goal of having
Freedom in orbit by 1994. The likely operational date has now slipped to
2000, although Nasa has already spent Dollars 8bn on preparatory work.
The latest design review and accompanying political uncertainties have left
Freedom's supporters in Congress and the aerospace industry feeling confused
and apprehensive.
'My biggest fear is that the whole programme could be lost if Congress votes
against it when the new design is presented in June,' says Tom Williams of
McDonnell Douglas. Space station contracts keep 2,500 people employed at the
company's aerospace centre in southern California.
The fate of Freedom will have ramifications well beyond the domestic
aerospace industry because the project has international partners, notably
Japan and the European Space Agency. Their representatives are now in
Washington working with Nasa's redesign team.
Esa plans to spend Dollars 2.9bn over the next seven years on its
contribution, a manned laboratory to be attached to the main US space
station. 'This could come out positively for Europe, if our support becomes
more important to Nasa because they have to drop some of what they were
planning to do,' says Daria Robinson of Esa. 'Or it could turn out
negatively if the Americans cut down the project to the point where it is no
longer interesting to take part.'
To keep its options open, Esa is also discussing co-operation on future
space stations with Russia. Esa may provide a module for the Russian Mir-2
in the late 1990s.
But Nasa too is talking about bringing Russia into its plans and optimists
believe there is now an opportunity of making the space station into a
global project.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Technology: Stoking up the engine - Bill Clinton has pledged
to make technology a central focus of his administration. FT writers look at
what the investment really means
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE GESTALT of the gigabit' is President Bill Clinton's new catchphrase for
the high-technology focus of his administration. He has proposed a Dollars
17bn (Pounds 11.9bn) four-year plan for new and expanded federally-funded
technology projects and tax incentives.
Creating new 'high-value jobs' is the primary goal of the Clinton technology
policy, which the president unveiled during a visit to Silicon Valley last
month. He called for the creation of a 'public-private sector partnership'
that will generate investment in technology development and encourage the
formation of high-tech companies.
We want to 'generate more of these kinds of companies, more technological
advances to keep the US always on the cutting edge of change and to make
sure that we'll be able to create a lot of good new jobs in the future,' the
president told workers at Silicon Graphics, the computer workstation company
where he unveiled his technology initiatives.
Almost 40 per cent of the proposed technology budget is in the form of
research and development tax credits designed to encourage private-sector
investment. Responding to industry demands, the president has proposed the
tax credit be made permanent. Over the past few years the tax credit has
been enacted each year, but only after it expired, so companies could not
count on it when drawing up their R&amp;D budgets.
The president's broader economic plan also includes tax incentives for
long-term investment in small companies and some tax relief on capital
investments for larger companies. However, the tax cuts will be at least
partially offset by an increase in corporate tax rates.
On the spending side, the Clinton technology policy proposes a significant
shift in the use of federal funds to back non-defence research. In the 1993
fiscal year, the civilian share of the total federal research and
development budget was approximately 41 per cent, or Dollars 27.9bn,
according to the administration. The president aims to increase this to more
than 50 per cent, or Dollars 36.6bn by 1998.
In future, the US government will play a direct role in helping companies to
develop and profit from innovations rather than funding defence or space
missions that serendipitously provide 'spin-offs' for the commercial sector.
The flagship of the technology plan is the 'information superhighway'
scheme; a nationwide high-speed broadband communications network linking
businesses, schools, libraries, hospitals, government offices and,
ultimately, homes.
Another example of 'industry-government partnership' in the Clinton
technology policy is the advanced manufacturing initiative which will
provide matching funds to industry consortia, using Sematech, the US
semiconductor industry research group, as a model.
The federal government will also match state and regional funds to create a
national network of 'manufacturing extension centres' that disseminate
information on the latest manufacturing technology.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology's advanced technology
programme will be significantly expanded to provide matching grants to
industry-led research and development projects including consortia such as
Sematech. Funding for Nist will be increased from Dollars 381m in 1993 to
Dollars 1.2bn in 1997. Other national laboratories will also be drawn into
the effort to boost industrial competitiveness.
The Clinton policy sets a target of 10 to 20 per cent of the budgets of the
labs being devoted to research and development partnerships with industry.
Clinton also aims to cut spending on 'big science' projects, while
maintaining basic research as a high priority.
Although sceptical about how much impact these programmes will have, US
high-technology industry executives are generally happy with the Clinton
administration's increased focus on technology. 'We are pleased to see the
new administration emphasising the high-technology segment as the key to
rebuilding the manufacturing infrastructure of the US,' said William Reed,
president of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, an
industry trade group.
The president's leadership in establishing programmes and policy directions
geared to advancing the development and use of technology will have more
impact than the money being spent on technology policy, says Ed McCracken,
president of Silicon Graphics.
The high-tech industry is also responding keenly to the president's call for
industry-government co-operation. Semi, for example, is proposing a
government-backed consortium to develop manufacturing technology for flat
panel displays, such as those used in portable computers. Currently, Japan
dominates this market.
The readiness of US high-tech industry groups to accept a more activist role
by government is in some ways surprising. Silicon Valley, in particular, has
long been known for its independent, entrepreneurial companies. 'There is
still a cowboy spirit in Silicon Valley, we like to think we can take care
of ourselves,' says McCracken.
Nonetheless, he believes that an 'arm's length' relationship between
industry and government no longer makes sense. 'With the issues facing our
country today, in particular the need to create jobs, I believe that we have
to work together.'
Yet to be seen, however, is whether the policy will produce a net increase
in employment. Although a sampling of almost 700 venture capital-backed
start-up companies created over 22,000 jobs last year, according to a recent
survey, total employment in the US electronics industry has declined in each
of the past four years.
New companies are not creating jobs as fast as established companies are
laying off workers. It is also evident that technology eliminates jobs - on
the factory floor and in the office. Yet to remain competitive companies
have to become more productive and cannot afford to be afraid of losing
jobs, industry executives say.
'If you assume that those jobs are going to go away, then you have to deal
with the problem. One of the things I like about the Clinton programme is
that he seemed to be ready to tackle this issue,' says McCracken.
The ability to adjust to the rapid changes brought about by technology
advances is one of the trademarks of a successful high-technology company.
The government, Clinton says, must work more like that, adopting the
philosophy of the high-tech industry, or the 'gestalt of the gigabit'.
'I believe my job as president is to try to adjust America so that we can
win in the 21st century, so that we can make change our friend and not our
enemy.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flagship of the Clinton technology plan is the development of
'information superhighways', a nationwide communications network.
Building on a programme established in 1991 by legislation sponsored by
Vice-President Al Gore when he was in the Senate, the scheme is an ambitious
effort to 'jumpstart' the construction of networks that the administration
says: 'have the same effect on US economic and social development as public
investment in the railroads had in the 19th century'.
Key elements of the plan include increased federal funding for R&amp;D in
supercomputers, high-speed networking and software and a programme to
subsidise the construction of networking linking schools, hospitals and
libraries.
Sensitive to charges that the programme is an example of 'high-tech pork',
administration officials stress that the government will not award big
contracts to one or two companies. 'We are trying to energise the private
sector, create the competition that will ensure that the best technology
gets out quickly and provide the leadership so that everyone is moving in
the same direction,' says Mike Nelson of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy.
Already, there has been an enthusiastic response to the information
superhighways proposal in Silicon Valley, according to Ed McCracken of
Silicon Graphics.
The local telephone and cable companies are accelerating plans to install
high-speed lines. 'Potential uses of high-speed networks - in health,
education and business - have become the subject of cocktail conversation,'
he says.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown warns of cut in spending on
unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL EXPENDITURE on the unemployed is due to fall to Pounds 565 per capita
in 1993-94 or less than half the Pounds 1,188 a head spent when Mr John
Major took office as prime minister in 1990, according to Mr Gordon Brown,
the shadow chancellor.
Mr Brown told Labour's finance and industry group that the early release of
the 1993-94 Supply Estimates, usually published on Budget day, had revealed
a Pounds 100m cut in schemes to assist the unemployed and business.
Among the cuts were a 7 per cent reduction in the Training for Work
initiative and a 14 per cent cut in the One Stop Business Services scheme.
Other savings include a Pounds 10m cut in regional assistance and 15 per
cent reduction in funding for business start-ups, now expected to total
Pounds 133m.
Mr Brown's calculations on spending on the unemployed are based on adding
the total allocations made through the Training and Enterprise Councils
(Tecs) to special initiatives for the unemployed.
According to his figures, calculated at 1992-93 prices, the outturn in
1990-91 was Pounds 2.38bn compared to a forecast Pounds 1.69bn in the coming
fiscal year. Over the period, total unemployment has risen by about 1m.
The Department of Employment last night said it had been unable to check Mr
Brown's figures, but added that expenditure on the unemployed was due to
rise by Pounds 177m - or 1 percentage point - in real terms in 1993-94.
Mr Brown was winding up Labour's three-month campaign for a 'Budget for
jobs'. Restating Labour's goal of full employment, he used a leaked trade
and industry department report on industrial competitiveness to underscore
the need for intervention.
'Any Budget that does not begin to reverse that industrial decline by a
long-term plan to tackle the critical failure to invest in people in
industry and in our social and economic fabric is a Budget that will fail
Britain,' he said.
Earlier, Mr Brown forecast that today's Budget would include another
'underfunded' temporary jobs programme, the 'reannouncing' of the Heathrow
rail link, the sale of a further tranche of BT shares and the masking of
petrol tax rises as 'help for the environment'.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM firm on summer target for
Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is sticking to his target of ratification of the Maastricht
treaty by the end of July in spite of last week's defeat in the Commons.
Amid signs yesterday that some 'soft' Tory Euro-sceptics were reconsidering
their opposition to the government, senior ministers said that the proposed
timetable for the legislation still allowed for ratification before the
summer recess.
The prime minister has told close associates he is determined that, if
possible, Maastricht should not be allowed to wreck October's Conservative
party conference for the second year in succession.
To avoid a damaging confrontation similar to that last year the bill would
have to pass all the remaining hurdles - including the House of Lords -
before the summer recess begins at the end of July.
The ministers acknowledged that the government still faced possible defeat
on a number of opposition amendments. There remains a risk also that the
legislation will be derailed if opposition parties are successful in
pressing new amendments to remove Britain's opt-out from the social chapter.
But barring a dramatic setback on the social chapter, the plans now
pencilled in by the government assume that the present committee stage of
the legislation will be completed before the second Danish referendum on May
18.
That timetable is based on the fact that six groups of amendments have still
to be discussed in the committee stage. Each of those could be expected to
take one or at most two days in the Commons.
With two days a week allocated to the legislation, that implies a further
five or six weeks in committee. Allowing for intervals necessitated by the
Budget debate this week and for a two-week Easter recess, the committee
stage would then be wound up in mid-May.
Ministers are increasingly optimistic that the report stage for the
legislation - necessitated by the passage of opposition amendments - will be
relatively short. That would provide for the concluding third reading debate
by MPs to take place at the end of May or early in June. That in turn would
give the House of Lords at least a month to debate the treaty.
The government acknowledges that a hard core of between 30 and 40 Tories
will continue to harry the legislation at every opportunity. But an
announcement yesterday by Mr George Walden, the former minister, that he
would drop his opposition was seen as a signal that some Tory MPs who have
previously abstained are now willing to support the bill.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Facing a cultural shift at the
coalface - Miners' unions remain sceptical about changing work patterns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKPLACE reform is expected to be a vital ingredient in the government's
white paper on the coal industry.
The viability of all Britain's pits, not just those facing immediate
closure, will be seen to depend on the willingness of miners to accept
sweeping new labour practices.
British Coal requires changing work patterns to cut deep-mine operating
costs by 28 per cent over the next five years and raise output per man-shift
from 5.95 tonnes to 9.37 tonnes by 1997-98.
Managers say this will mean a sharp break with the working culture that has
dominated the industry since nationalisation in 1947. They want an end to
what they see as an over-centralised bureaucratic structure where unions
exercise substantial power over decision-making. The recent Commons trade
and industry committee report stressed the need to reform working practices
'including the passing of any necessary legislation where this would reduce
costs without compromising safety'.
The unions remain sceptical. They see reform as the end of the joint
consultation system that gave them enormous influence in the workplace.
British Coal wants more power for local managers.
The Department of Trade and Industry is pressing ministers for a repeal of
the five-day-week agreement which sets the length of a miner's shift and the
operating week from Monday to Friday.
'We would not seek to increase the amount of working time per man but to
repackage it into fewer long attendances, some of which could be rostered
for the weekend,' British Coal said in a private briefing paper. 'The
colliery would work more intensively to achieve lower costs, but each man
would not work more hours.'
It believes miners would not resist longer shifts and more flexible working
patterns. British Coal believes, for example, that longer shifts are
advantageous in the north-east where men face long travelling times to the
coalface.
A 10-hour shift working the same basic hours over a period of eight weeks
would mean a miner working 29 10-hour shifts as opposed to 40 shifts of 7
1/4 hours. This would give miners an extra 11 days off over the eight-week
period and in a full year more than 60 additional days off.
British Coal also wants to amend the Mines and Quarries Acts to increase
efficiency in administration by simplifying procedures without endangering
safety. On top of this it is demanding repeal of section 46 of the Coal
Industry Nationalisation Act which lays down joint consultation and
conciliation procedures.
At present all unions are unenthusiastic but their members may be more
willing to adapt. Certainly in the eight years since the miners' strike
miners have shown their readiness to accept an enormous shake-up in the
industry.
There has been a 79 per cent cut in manpower on the coalfields, with the
loss of 135,000 men. The number of collieries has dropped from 133 to 50
while output per man shift has climbed from 2.72 tonnes to 5.31 tonnes.
British Coal argues that in a more decentralised, market-driven industry the
working practice reforms could ensure that UK miners become even more
competitive against those overseas. Only in this way, it says, can they
expect to ensure the survival of their industry.

Mr Michael Alison, the Conservative MP for Selby - who represents the Church
Commissioners in the Commons - gave the undertaking during oral questions.
Publication date had not yet been determined, he told Mr Frank Field, Labour
MP for Birkenhead.
The report was commissioned following criticism last year of the Church
Commissioners' investment performance. Last July, the Financial Times
reported that the commissioners had suffered Pounds 500m investment losses.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers resist leasehold rent move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans for leasehold reform survived a cross-party move to favour
the tenants' interest yesterday, Alison Smith writes. Peers resisted by 162
votes to 117 - a government majority of 45 - a bid to remove the 'low rent'
test from the proposals.
Last week, the government relied on cross-party support as it managed to
fend off an attempt by more than 100 Tory backbench peers to lessen the
impact on landlords. The peers sought to limit the reforms, which allow long
leaseholders to buy the freehold of their properties, to resident
leaseholders only.
An earlier move to end the provision that a property must be let at a low
rent to qualify under the proposals was defeated in the Commons.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pits study piles pressure on
British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL faces severe difficulties in closing Grimethorpe colliery - one
of 10 pits where production has ended - after an independent consultant
yesterday rejected its argument that the mine is financially unviable.
The support for the South Yorkshire colliery by John T Boyd, a consultancy
appointed by the government, will add to British Coal's problems when it
returns to the High Court probably next month to put its case for the
closures.
Meanwhile it emerged yesterday that the cabinet is unlikely to discuss coal
at its weekly meeting on Thursday. This raises the possibility that a white
paper on the issue, promised last October after the government was forced to
back down on plans to close 31 pits, will be delayed beyond next week.
The cabinet committee on coal will later this week be given an update on the
DTI's latest proposals. It is likely to discuss problems posed by a further
delay, not least for British Coal which has no contracts with electricity
generators for coal sales after the end of this month.
Boyd, in its final report on the 10 pits earmarked for early closure, gave
some comfort to British Coal by concluding that it was preserving the fabric
of the collieries in accordance with an undertaking to High Court judges.
The judges last year ruled that closure of the 10 was illegal and ordered
that an independent scrutineer should assist on future decisions. Unions
have rejected British Coal's and the government's contention that Boyd can
provide that role.
Boyd's final report re-affirms its conclusion in an earlier draft that
Grimethorpe failed to meet closure criteria because, according to Boyd, it
was profit-making and could remain so. The pit could 'reasonably' be
projected to be profitable, although performance would have to be improved
over the next three years.
Boyd found that Taff Merthyr, another of the 10, did not meet BC's closure
criteria because it could have been viable for several weeks longer. Boyd
does not recommend re-opening it but says miners should be compensated for
loss of earnings.
Boyd found Markham could become economically viable if there was weekend
working and longer shifts, but the colliery would require an extensive
amount of development and a 'substantial im-provement' in the work ethos.
Although miners at Grimethorpe will welcome the Boyd report, they will be
hard-pressed to win their case that the mine stays open.
British Coal was placing considerable emphasis yesterday on Boyd's
acknowledgement that the profitability of any operation is dependent on
there being a market for its product. The white paper is unlikely to provide
a market, and therefore a lifeline, for even half of the 31 threatened pits.
'The retention of Grimethorpe would be at the expense of another colliery
with more realistic prospects of maintaining viable operations.'
For Labour, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said
that the report showed Mr Heseltine had 'got it wrong again.'
'Last October he told parliament all 10 pits must close because they were
clearly uneconomic. Now his own consultants have concluded he was wrong,' Mr
Cook said.
Monktonhall Mineworkers, the consortium of miners which runs an Edinburgh
colliery leased last year from British Coal, has agreed a five-year deal
with ScottishPower to supply the electricity company with 100,000 tonnes of
coal a year.
But it was not clear last night whether the contract, the second big order
the company has won, would stave off a severe financial crisis caused mainly
by delays in bringing the mine back into production.
It emerged at the weekend that the 160 miners, each of whom has invested
Pounds 10,000 in the company, had gone without wages for seven weeks after
Bank of Scotland refused to advance more loans.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd wins backing over call to
China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, for the Chinese
government to end the 'stalemate' over political reform in Hong Kong
yesterday won rare all-party backing from the Commons.
His decision to combine support for plans by Mr Chris Patten, governor of
Hong Kong, to extend democracy with a renewed invitation to China to restart
negotiations was supported by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
With only a handful of backbench MPs challenging his strategy, the foreign
secretary said that the 'talks about talks' with Beijing which broke down
last week could resume at any time.
'We will continue to pursue steadily the path of co-operation with China: we
look to the Chinese side to do the same,' he added. Mr Hurd said Britain's
objective remained 'sensible arrangements for the future which could be
continued after 1997'.
He was joined by Mr Jack Cunningham and Sir David Steel, his Labour and
Liberal Democrat counterparts, in warning Beijing that Britain could not
ignore the strong pressures for greater democracy in the colony before its
transfer to China.
Mr Cunningham said Labour would support efforts to 'safeguard' the
legitimate interests of the people of Hong Kong alongside its willingness to
hold talks with China without preconditions.
That view was echoed by Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the Commons
foreign affairs committee, who said Mr Patten's proposals would simply put
into practice agreements already made with China.
Sir David, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said that if
Beijing considered that Mr Patten's proposals broke previous agreements on
the future of the colony, the matter could be referred to the International
Court of Justice.

MONKTONHALL Mine-workers, the consortium of miners which runs an Edinburgh
colliery leased last year from British Coal, has agreed a five-year deal
with ScottishPower to supply the electricity company with 100,000 tonnes of
coal a year.
But it was not clear last night whether the contract, the second big order
the company has won, would stave off a severe financial crisis caused mainly
by delays in bringing the mine back into production.
It emerged at the weekend that the 160 miners, each of whom has invested
Pounds 10,000 in the company, had gone without wages for seven weeks after
Bank of Scotland refused to advance more loans. At the end of February the
company said it was seeking a partner or outside investor to overcome
funding problems.
Yesterday Caledonian Mining, a firm of mining consultants based in Newark,
Notts, confirmed that it had had discussions with Monktonhall Mineworkers
and its advisers Price Waterhouse. It said it was interested only in having
overall control of the company.
The mineworkers are reluctant to cede control to Caledonian Mining, which
was their rival in seeking to lease the mine from British Coal.
Caledonian said it wanted more information about the production levels
achieved by the miners, the problems which had caused the financial crisis
and the mine's marketing position.
It said it did not agree with the mineworkers' current mining method and
questioned their company's 'ability to support the mine as a long-term
viable proposition.'
Caledonian indicated that it would not buy out the miners for the full
amount they had invested, which totals Pounds 1.6m. It would introduce
different mining methods.
ScottishPower said it had decided to place a long-term order with
Monktonhall after a 12,000-tonne test load proved satisfactory.
Monktonhall has an 87,000-tonne order to supply domestic coal to British
Coal.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government disavows workfare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has no intention of introducing a workfare-type system
compelling claimants to work in return for benefit received, a junior
minister told MPs yesterday, David Owen writes.
On the eve of a Budget likely to include a range of unemployment-related
measures, Mr Alistair Burt, a junior social security minister, said the
government had been trying to provide 'practical' help for the unemployed.
His comments followed Labour attacks on the burden which high unemployment
imposed on the social security department's annual budget.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said the Pounds 10.4bn
the department expected to spend in the coming year on the unemployed -
equivalent to 12 per cent of the department's total spending - was a
'frightening' figure and a 'condemnation' of government policy.
Mr Dewar urged the government to recognise that the best way of cutting back
on this spending was to reduce the dole queues and to support policies that
would have that effect. He called for the principle of workfare to be
rejected.
A redesign of schemes for the unemployed to provide programmes combining
temporary work with job-hunting and involving some element of compulsion is
believed to be in the pipeline.
Today's measures may include a relaxation of the rule on the hours someone
can study before becoming ineligible for benefit.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Electrical engineering output rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG output by the steel and computer industries was behind the good
performance by manufacturers in January highlighted in government figures
released yesterday.
Metals production jumped by a provisional seasonally adjusted 17 per cent
between last December and the following month - mainly a result of stronger
steel output following shutdowns during the Christmas break.
Over the same period the output of electrical and instrument engineering
including computers rose by 3.2 per cent.
In the three months to the end of January, metals production was down 3.5
per cent compared with the previous three months.
On the same three-monthly basis electrical and instru-ment engineering
increased by 2.9 per cent, while the whole of the engineering sector saw an
output rise of 0.2 per cent.
Chemicals and artificial fibres showed a three-monthly increase in
production of 2.7 per cent while textiles and footwear registered a 0.3 per
cent rise.
Between the two consecutive three-month periods output of food, drink and
tobacco, and of minerals and related products recorded declines of 1.6 per
cent and 3.4 per cent respectively.
Elsewhere in engineering, vehicles and components suffered a 5.2 per cent
production decline on the same three-monthly basis.
Metal and mechanical goods registered respective falls of 0.6 per cent and
0.2 per cent.
In the latest three months - compared with the corresponding period a year
ago - engineering production increased 0.9 per cent, while metals output
fell by 7.1 per cent.
Minerals and related products registered an output fall on the same basis of
5.9 per cent, and textiles, chemicals, and the food, drink and tobacco
sector recorded production increases of 3.4 per cent, 1.7 per cent and 0.4
per cent respectively.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Housing market points to revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE sales continued to rise strongly last month, a survey of 30 of the
country's largest estate agency chains showed yesterday.
The survey by the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents (OCEA), an
industry-appointed body, provides further evidence of a revival in the UK
housing market this year.
There have been signs of a slight cooling in the market, although
transactions are still running ahead of last March, as potential purchasers
hold back from completing deals in case the Budget produces any surprises.
The 30 large estate agency companies covered by OCEA handle about half of UK
house transactions. Last month they agreed 40,534 sales after taking account
of cancellations. That was 11.2 per cent more than in February last year and
the highest monthly total for at least 15 months.
Net sales last month were 27 per cent higher than in the previous month. A
sale is recorded only if finance has been arranged, solicitors have been
instructed and no chain is involved, says OCEA, which started compiling
sales figures in December 1991.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, said: 'These latest results are encouraging. I would expect the
housing revival to be resumed in April and May provided the chancellor does
nothing in the Budget to damage confidence in what remains a fragile
market.'

THE COST of Britain's welfare state will continue to rise unless services
are targeted at the poor, Professor Dennis Snower of Birkbeck College,
London, said yesterday.
He said in a pamphlet published yesterday by the non-partisan Centre for
Economic Policy Research that middle-income groups should be helped to make
their own provision.
He says most welfare services are inherently resistant to productivity
growth. Their real cost will rise inexorably, threatening the ability of the
welfare state to help those in genuine poverty.
Prof Snower says redirecting welfare services is the only way to maintain
society's responsibility to its poorest sections. But it would also allow
tax cuts for the middle classes, leaving everyone better off.
He says loans against human capital would be the best way for most people to
cover periods of unemployment, pay for healthcare and finance education and
training.
Thus employed people could borrow against future earnings, making them more
willing to retrain or accept alternative jobs. He says students should
borrow more of the cost of their higher education so that they would
'internalise' its costs and benefits.
Banks are unwilling to lend against human capital because they find it hard
to collect debts. Prof Snower says the government should guarantee such
loans as it can trace people through the tax system.
He also endorses wage subsidies for the unemployed, a measure ministers have
been considering in the run-up to today's Budget. He says un-employed people
should be given the option of using their benefits to provide vouchers for
employers that hire them - with the voucher worth more the longer the person
has been unemployed.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Upbeat forecast for Scots economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish economy is forecast by Mackay Consultants, a firm of economic
consultants, to resume growing in 1993 after declining in 1992. Mackay
believes Scotland will benefit from the devaluation of the pound because its
industries are more oriented towards exporting than the UK average.
Mackay predicts that the Scottish economy will grow by 1.4 per cent in 1993.
This compares with the Treasury's forecast in the 1992 Autumn Statement for
the whole UK economy of 1 per cent, although the average for the UK made by
independent commentators is now 1.4 per cent.
Although the government's estimate for Scotland's gross domestic product
only goes up to 1991, when it showed a 0.2 per cent decline, Mackay
concludes that in 1992 Scottish GDP fell by 1.3 per cent, slightly worse
than the UK economy as a whole which fell by 1.0 per cent, according to the
Treasury.
Unemployment in Scotland went below that of the UK as a whole in February
1992 for the first time in living memory. In January 1992 it was 9.9 per
cent on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with the UK figure of 10.6 per
cent, giving Scotland a lower unemployment rate than all regions of the UK
except for the east Midlands and East Anglia.
Mackay expects the large Scottish electronics industry to be one of the
strongest manufacturing sectors in 1993.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Ofgas to act over power plant supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFGAS, the gas industry regulator, will take action next week to force
British Gas to change the destination of gas sold to National Power.
The gas supply, sold three years ago for Pounds 1.5bn over 15 years, is
earmarked for a gas-fired power station at Didcot in Oxfordshire. But
National Power asked British Gas last year if it could transfer the supply
to Little Barford in Bedfordshire.
The electricity generator has started construction of the Little Barford
680MW power station, which should be operational in 1995. But it has put
plans for its Didcot station on hold amid uncertainty surrounding gas-fired
power while the government conducts its energy review.
British Gas was reluctant to make the supply change because it did not want
to be seen to encourage gas-fired generation while the subject is
politically sensitive.
Ofgas started legal proceedings against the company in December and is due
to serve an enforcement order on British Gas next week. An enforcement order
is Ofgas's highest legal power - it gives British Gas 28 days to comment on
the matter, after which it becomes effective.
'We can't see why the issue is so controversial, but we've been discussing
it with British Gas for nine months and each time we get near a resolution,
they back away from it,' said Mr Greg McGregor at Ofgas. The enforcement
order could allow other power generators to change the delivery site for
their gas, but so far National Power is the only company to apply to do so.
Ofgas's enforcement order will state that British Gas must come forward with
new contractual arrangements for customers buying gas for power generation
under the same terms as National Power. This will enable the company to
change the site at which the gas should be delivered.
British Gas is wary of making any changes to its gas contracts because it
does not want to pre-empt the government's white paper on energy, due to be
published in the next two weeks.
National Power said yesterday it was 'very pleased' with Ofgas's action, and
it had little sympathy with British Gas's view that the issue was
politically sensitive.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Charities targeted by unions' bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITY Trust Bank, the small bank set up by the unions and the Co-operative
Wholesale Society, is to step up its competition with the high-street banks
by extending its services to charities and and voluntary organisations, Mr
Gordon Beesley, the bank's managing director, said yesterday.
The bank will offer small charities with a turnover of less than Pounds 5m a
year free banking, while larger charities will be offered no-interest,
no-commission services. The bank believes charities are suffering as a
result of increased bank charges.
It also plans to launch a campaign to encourage employers to provide
occupational pension schemes for low-paid workers in conjunction with other
employers and the bank. It estimates that between 7m and 9m workers have no
provision beyond the state pension.
Sir Dennis Landau, the bank's new chairman, announced the broad outline of
its plans at the same time as its annual results for 1992. Those showed that
the bank made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 368,000 after a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.7m the previous year.
The bank's risk-asset ratio - the standard for assessing balance-sheet
strength - rose from 18.5 per cent to 22.7 per cent last year while the
number of its accounts rose 11 per cent to more than 15,000 with just over a
quarter from outside the union movement.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Simplify equality laws, says EOC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission yesterday urged the government to
simplify 'grotesquely complex' laws on equal pay after the settlement of a
seven-year case involving five women.
The women were employed by H. &amp; J. Quick, a Manchester-based Ford dealer, as
administrators and financial clerks.
They were awarded a total of Pounds 15,000 after a tribunal found that their
work was of equal value to that done by higher-earning men who worked as
parts salesmen, van drivers and car cleaners.
The company has decided to withdraw its appeal against the ruling and has
paid them the difference in wages. Only one of the women still works for the
company.
Quick said it 'felt it was the right time to settle'. It added that the law
was very complex and that much management time had been spent on the issue.
The Equal Opportunities Commission wants to see the existing acts covering
sex discrimination and equal pay replaced with a single equal treatment act.
There are now long delays before cases are brought before tribunals, and
independent experts commissioned by tribunals to evaluate jobs take an
average of 12 months to complete their reports. Cases going to appeal take
on average a further 18 months.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Calling time on drinking with the boys: How women see their
role in the unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS WOMEN trade unionists gather for their annual conference in Blackpool
this week they will be forced to confront one unpleasant fact. The movement
itself - far from being able to report gains in promoting women to top jobs
 -appears to be going backwards.
In 1990 there were five female general secretaries of TUC-affiliated unions.
Today only one is left: Ms Elizabeth Symons, who leads the small Association
of First Division Civil Servants.
According to one woman union official, many men in unions 'are still making
the right noises, but have done very little to shift their attitudes'. The
apparent decline in the fortunes of women within unions has been partly
structural and partly cultural, she says. Women have often lost out - or
given up the battle of working in an often hostile environment - as tiers of
union management have been stripped out to save costs.
'Women working for unions have to work extremely hard to prove themselves,'
the official continues. 'If they're not endlessly drinking with the boys
then they're considered not to be playing the game and they don't get on.
Some women have decided to get out and make their contribution to the labour
movement in some other way. To some men, that's seen as bottling out - not
being able to stand the pressure.'
Two of the unions which will be calling at the conference for a law to make
employers publish annual figures on the number of women they have promoted
have themselves lost their female leaders. At the Association of University
Teachers, Ms Diana Warwick has moved to a new job and has been succeeded by
a man; at the National Union of Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades, Mrs
Helen McGrath lost her general secretary's job to a male competitor as the
result of a merger.
The trend towards fewer, larger unions has been responsible for other
casualties. Ms Brenda Dean, as general secretary of the Sogat print union,
was the best known woman trade unionists of recent times. She disappeared
from view after the union's merger with the National Graphical Association
and has recently reappeared as head of the watchdog body which monitors
premium-rate telephone services. The merged print union is led by former NGA
general secretary Mr Tony Dubbins. The Health Visitors' Association, in the
past always female-led, has been subsumed into the male-led MSF general
technical union.
The loss of female figureheads is arguably bad for unions' public image at a
time when efforts are being made to broaden appeal. Women are less likely to
join unions than men, but are becoming an increasingly important part of the
workforce and now make up about a third of union membership. As traditional
male jobs in manufacturing are lost, unions are promoting themselves to
women in order to keep up their memberships.
It could be seen as just bad luck that the movement is now down to one
female general secretary. However, representation at the next level down is
also poor and apparently getting worse. According to the Labour Research
Department, seven of the 10 largest unions have seen a decline in the number
of female national full-time officials in recent years.
The greatest progress seems to have been made on national executive
committees - the top ruling bodies - where almost all of the biggest 10
unions have improved their female representation. The new 'super-union'
Unison, which comes into being on 1 July, will have at least 44 out of 67
seats on its executive occupied by women. About 1m of the 1.4m membership of
the new union, formed out of Nalgo and Nupe, the local government unions,
and Cohse, the health service union, will be female.
However, even in this female-dominated union, the very top jobs will held by
men for some time to come. Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, will
lead the new body until he retires in 1996.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Revival predicted for construction equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UPTURN is in sight for the construction equipment industry after three
consecutive years of 'devastating' decline, according to the Corporate
Intelligence Group.
Unit sales of construction equipment such as excavators, loaders and
dumptrucks fell 3 per cent last year to 8,910, it said. Demand in unit terms
was the lowest recorded for more than a decade - sales were barely a third
of the peak of 22,544 units in 1988.
The group said the mood of more than 40 leading equipment distributors and
manufacturers interviewed last month was bleak 'with an overwhelming
resentment against the government for doing so little to relieve the
situation'.
But, it said, there was a general consensus that the worst was behind the
industry. Recovery would be patchy and slow to begin with, but demand should
harden by mid-1993, resulting in a full year's increase of 21 per cent.
The group said a number of factors supported its forecast:
Interest rates are down to an acceptable level, and end-users can
contemplate new purchases with realism.
Good second-hand equipment is hard to find, with a significant proportion of
the stock of used machines having been shipped overseas in the last two
years.
Machines sold at the peak of demand are coming up for renewal. Although the
machines will not be replaced on a one-for-one basis, the trend will start
to give some comfort to hard-pressed dealers.
The group says demand will probably recover first from sales to the
plant-hire sector, resulting in sales increases for backhoe loaders, smaller
crawler excavators, mini-excavators and skid-steer loaders. Larger equipment
types - rigid dumptrucks, heavier crawler excavators and bigger wheeled
loaders - will be slower to recover.
The forecast assumes that the government will do little more to stimulate
the economy. If it does, and business confidence is partially restored,
equipment demand could recover to 12,000 units next year, the group
believes. Even that, however, is 20 per cent to 25 per cent below what it
believes is a viable and profitable level of business.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Dumptrucks seller hopes to scale the peaks again: How one
importer has coped with the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Chris Rees shows a picture of the 'Matterhorn' to visitors to his
office near Cambridge, the last thing on his mind is a skiing holiday in the
Swiss Alps.
This 'Matterhorn' is a graph of the UK market for articulated dumptrucks.
The summit was in 1989 when 869 trucks were sold, according to statistics
from London-based RB Research. 'Happy days,' comments Mr Rees.
Last year sales languished at 293 units. Mr Rees, managing director of VME
Construction Equipment GB, the UK importer for the Brussels-based group,
says he is 'hoping for twin peaks'.
For the first eight months of last year, VME - best known in the UK for its
Volvo BM loaders and dumptrucks - coped with the recession relatively well.
It increased the market shares of its main products, sticking to a policy of
premium prices and a high level of customer support. Dropping prices too
far, says Mr Rees, would in turn depress the high resale value of the plant
 -a crucial selling point.
Employment has been reduced sharply - 265 in the UK compared with 400 in
1989 for VME and the much smaller UK workforce of Akermans, a Swedish
hydraulic excavator company acquired in 1991. Employees have agreed a pay
freeze for this year.
On top of the recession, Mr Rees and his team had a short, sharp shock in
the autumn. Unlike big multinational rivals such as Caterpillar and Komatsu,
VME has no UK manufacturing plant, and the devaluation of sterling in
September triggered what Mr Rees calls 'two months of hell'  - VME imports
95 per cent of its products, and all its parts, from Sweden. Then came the
devaluation of the Swedish krona in mid November, and it was back to square
one.
Until September 15, Mr Rees was looking to turn in a profit of Pounds 1m for
the year, but Black Wednesday changed all that. 'We sat in this room that
afternoon wondering what the hell we were going to do,' he says.
The effect of a 15 per cent reduction in margins was felt immediately, as
the company carries very little stock. After discussing the situation with
his head office, Mr Rees and his national sales manager, Mr Bob Watterson,
decided to continue trading as if the devaluation had not occurred.
The company badly wanted to avoid disorderly pricing if the increases were
reversed a few weeks later, and passing on the effect of the devaluation to
customers would have hit sales volume.
'Volume is critical,' says Mr Rees. 'We need to keep up sales of machines to
support our parts and service operation in two or three years time. It's a
balancing act between short-term profits and long-term benefits.'
After a big sales push in December, VME broke even last year. Trading in the
first quarter has been better than a year ago, and some confidence has
returned, says Mr Rees. What customers need now, he says, is stability.
But those cherished twin peaks remain a long way beyond the horizon. A
gentle upward gradient is the most that can be hoped for this year.

FT  16 MAR 93 / FT Conference: EC to review water standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUARTER of Europe's rivers fall below European Community environmental
standards, the European Commission said yesterday. It announced a
wide-ranging review this year of all its directives on water quality.
Mr Tom Garvey, deputy director-general of the environment directorate, said
some EC standards might be modified or dropped in the light of new
scientific evidence.
But Mr Garvey, speaking in London at a Financial Times conference on the
European water industry, said he was disappointed at the lack of improvement
in EC water quality in the past 20 years.
UK water companies and their Continental counterparts have been campaigning
fiercely for a review of the EC water directives, some of which were issued
in the 1970s. They say many unnecessary and expensive to implement.
The companies have also been concerned that the National Rivers Authority,
the water quality watchdog, could add billions of pounds to industry
spending by a severe interpretation of the directives or by setting its own
statutory water quality objectives.
Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of the economic regulator Ofwat and
responsible for setting price rises, told the conference that 'an unending
escalation in prices would be intolerable' and that prices were 'now in
danger of being driven ever upwards by new obligations'.
Lord Crickhowell, chairman of the authority, accused the water companies and
Ofwat of exaggerating the likely costs of measures such as water quality
objectives when the objectives had not yet been set. The water industry has
estimated that this decade's capital spending to bring UK water in line with
environmental standards could be between Pounds 30bn and Pounds 45bn.
The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large water and
sewerage companies of England and Wales, yesterday welcomed the commission's
proposed review.

ISLINGTON Borough Council in north London has decided to appeal against last
month's High Court decision that it should repay more than Pounds 1m made
under invalid swap agreements to WestDeutsche Landesbank.
The ruling was made in the first test case since the Lords ruled two years
ago that councils had no power to enter interest-rate swap agreements. The
Lords' decision left 80 banks facing losses of Pounds 560m.
On Friday, Kleinwort Benson won a second test case against South Tyneside
council. It was awarded almost Pounds 2m in principal and interest payments.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Olympic symbol to become copyright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OLYMPIC symbol is to become the subject of exclusive copyright in
Britain, Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, announced yesterday, Gillian
Tett writes.
Under legislation expected to be passed soon, the British Olympic
Association will have sole UK control over the five-ringed Olympic symbol,
with rights to sell the symbol to promoters. Until now use of the symbol has
been unregulated. with a number of businesses across Britain adopting
versions for their marketing.
Mr Brooke said the move underlined the government's support for Manchester's
bid to host the 2000 Olympics. The International Olympic Committee required
countries hosting the games to provide a copyright guarantee for the symbol.
The British Olympic Association said that companies wishing to use any
version of the symbol would have to pay 'at least a six-figure sum' to
become official sponsors.

FT  16 MAR 93 / More heavy job cuts expected soon at Daf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER round of job cuts at Leyland Daf is expected in coming weeks as
the receivers cut excess stocks and bring vehicle output into line with
forecast demand.
Several hundred jobs are thought to be on the line.
The administrative receivers of Leyland Daf, the UK subsidiary of Daf, the
Dutch commercial vehicle maker which collapsed into receivership six weeks
ago, last month cut 1,715 of the company's 5,500 strong UK workforce.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, joint administrative receiver, said yesterday the
company was 'likely to be trading in receivership for months rather than
weeks; we must make sure that the balance between sales and production is
correct.'
The company had 'twice as much free stock as we should have' he added. 'Our
stocks must be much leaner and we must make sure that things are in
balance.' All three Leyland Daf plants were back in production, and the
receivers are studying what level of output could be sustained in the
present market.
The truck assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, was producing 100 to 125
trucks a week of which around a third would be accounted for by Leyland
Daf's two military truck contracts from the UK Ministry of Defence. Van
output is running at 230 to 250 a week.
Mr McKillop warned it was unlikely that there would any funds available for
payment to unsecured trade and other creditors of Leyland Daf 'The question
is what will be the shortfall to the syndicate of banks,' he said.
The most advanced plan for rescuing the constituent parts of the Leyland Daf
operations concerns the proposed management buy-out of the van business
based in Birmingham.
'I think there is a good chance that something will happen,' said Mr
McKillop. 'They have had encouraging discussions with institutions. I would
hope to be able to formalise plans in the next few weeks.
'Now that we have stabilised production, we are looking at keeping the
operations running for as long as it takes, for months if necessary.'
Mr McKillop has held talks with Paccar, the North American truckmaker, to
explore its interest in the Leyland truck plant, but and a management
buy-out is being explored.
The future of the UK truck operations is complicated by the continuing
confusion over its future relations with Daf Trucks, the new Dutch/Belgian
company formed to take over the core medium and heavy truck operations of
the old Daf group.
The success of a management buy-out or outside acquisition of the Leyland
plant appears to hinge on its ability to gain access to Daf Trucks'
Continental dealer network for sales of its UK-built 45 series light truck
range.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Names win stop-loss claims ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 100 Names yesterday won a High Court ruling allowing them to
recover directly claims on stop-loss insurance policies - personal
reinsurance which covers heavy losses.
Lloyd's unsuccessfully argued that the claims under the policies should
first be paid into premium trust funds, which contain premium income earned
by Lloyd's underwriters from insurance business.
The ruling could ease the cashflow problems of some loss-making Lloyd's
Names, who are among several thousand facing heavy losses at the insurance
market.
Mr Justice Tuckey in the Commercial Court ruled that Names - individuals
whose assets support the Lloyd's market - are entitled to receive recoveries
directly from brokers.
Mr Tuckey held that recoveries were not payable directly to the premium
trust funds unless specifically stated in the policy or unless the Name had
signed an 'irrevocable' letter of authority assigning the money to their
premium trust fund. A directive that all stop-loss recoveries must be paid
to the trust fund issued last year by Mr David Coleridge, then chairman of
Lloyd's, was ruled invalid.
A two-week moratorium on the ruling was agreed so that Lloyd's could
consider whether to appeal.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Hunt for tourism chief is widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has turned to headhunters Tyzack Accord to find a new
chairman of the British Tourist Authority after failing to attract a
suitable candidate to replace Mr William Davis, who will leave at the end of
this month.
Tourism industry managers fear a new chairman will not be in a position to
start immediately and that the authority might begin the run-up to the
summer tourist season with an interim head.
Tyzack has also been asked to find a new chief executive for the BTA to
replace Mr Michael Medlicott, who is to become European vice-president of
Delta Air Lines, the US carrier, next month.
One travel industry executive said Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage
secretary, should not have terminated Mr Davis's appointment without having
a replacement in mind. Mr Davis, a former editor of Punch, was told at the
end of January that he was unlikely to be reappointed when his three-year
term ended on March 31.
Potential candidates are believed to feel that two aspects of the Pounds
35,000 part-time post make it unattractive. The first is that the BTA head
will also chair the English Tourist Board, which is having its grant cut
from Pounds 15.6m last year to Pounds 9.1m in 1995.
One industry insider said: 'The BTA at least has the government's support
and commitment. The ETB has not got the government's support and its morale
is low. The BTA is an attractive job. The ETB is a poisoned chalice.'
The second drawback is that the post is for only two days a week. Mr John
Lee, a former tourism minister who lost his seat at the last general
election, said the post should be full-time.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Study of City trials procedure published
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE scope for transferring fraud cases out of the criminal justice system to
be dealt with by regulatory agencies is limited, according to research
published yesterday by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice.
The study is the first large-scale review of serious fraud since the 1986
Roskill report. It finds that, although there are cases or parts of
prosecutions which could have been dealt with outside the criminal justice
system, there is much doubt in the City about whether self-regulatory
organisations would have taken disciplinary action unless put under
political pressure.
The report says a problem remains over what to do about people such as Mr
Roger Levitt, head of the collapsed Levitt Group, and Mr Asil Nadir, former
chairman of Polly Peck, both of whom are due to stand trial in September and
who are not required to be members of any authorised body.
Professor Michael Levi of Cardiff University, author of the report, says the
changes to pre-trial procedures in serious fraud cases introduced after the
Roskill report have not yet bedded down.
That is partly because of the absence of sanctions in cases where the
defence does not co-operate in pre-trial stages, but also because there is
no process by which 'the system' or individual judges can learn from the
experiences of others.
Most judges do not want to conduct many fraud trials, and once they begin to
learn how to handle them, they stop. Then others who admit to having little
knowledge of fraud are selected because it is 'their turn'.
Professor Levi also casts doubt on the benefits to be gained from the
introduction of a formal system of US-style plea-bargaining in England and
Wales. He says UK sentencing practice after guilty pleas leaves less scope
for significant bargaining.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Loss from fraud 'likely to rise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING institutions and individual investors face the prospect of mounting
losses through increasingly sophisticated and widespread financial fraud, a
seminar organised by the International Chamber of Commerce heard yesterday.
'There is a need for the banking industry to tackle this problem and come
out openly and strongly against it,' said Mr Eric Ellen, chief executive of
the chamber's Business Security Services. 'The problem is widespread and
waiting to erupt.'
Delegates, including senior bankers, private investigators and police
officers, were given a large restricted-access file compiled by the ICC's
Commercial Crime Bureau identifying types of fraudulent banking transaction
which appear to be increasing.
The seminar focused in particular on fraudulent standby letters of credit. A
standby letter of credit is a guarantee from a bank to a customer that it
will honour that customer's trade debts to a third party. The letter can be
used as collateral to borrow funds.
Professor James Byrne, a US commercial law expert, told the seminar that
fraudsters were taking advantage of the proliferation of laws and the
complexity of international guidelines to couch documents in highly
legalistic language.
The quality of documents was in many cases enhanced by highly developed
copying machines and intercepted swift codes - swift is a fast
computer-based communication system banks use to transfer messages on
transactions and which can replace telexes.
One senior police officer told the conference one problem in pursuing fraud
cases was that banks sometimes refused to co-operate on the grounds of
confidentiality.
Without more support from the banks the police did not have the resources to
deal with the problem. 'Unless the banking fraternity gets its act together,
financial fraud is just going to mushroom,' he told the seminar.
A vice-president of a US bank said that the international recession had
brought about a 'cocktail of circumstances' in which fraudsters were
flourishing.

Such a level of increase could not be sustained, he said. The drugs bill

FT  16 MAR 93 / People: EBRD picks chief economist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has hired
a heavy hitter as chief economist to replace John Flemming, who leaves in
September to become warden of Wadham College, Oxford.
Michael Bruno (right), governor of the Bank of Israel between 1986 and 1991,
will take over in October. He was approached indirectly by the EBRD about
six months ago and opted for the London-based bank after turning down an
offer to be chief economist at the World Bank in Washington. Bruno is
currently Melchior Professor of International Economic Policy at the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem and president of the International Economic
Association.
At 60, Bruno is no stranger to the problems of radical economic change and
has been willing in the past to take a tough line with politicians.
He was one of the architects of a successful Israeli economic recovery
programme in the mid-1980s and later, as bank governor, had to cope with the
economic strains caused by mass immigration from the former Soviet Union.
Bruno has advised Mexico, the former Yugoslavia and Poland on economic
reform and wrote a book on stabilisation and reform while he was a visiting
professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At the Israeli central
bank, he was often embroiled in controversy with the Likud-led government.
In 1989 he took the brave step of urging cuts in the Israeli defence budget
to curb increases in government borrowing.
Such policy-making experience will be invaluable in his dealings with the
new democracies of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet
republics as well as with the Byzantine bureaucracy of the EBRD itself.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Amnesty plan for Salvadoran abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS at the UN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EL SALVADOR'S President Alfredo Cristiani has proposed an amnesty for active
and former high-ranking military officers blamed by a United Nations report
for some of the worst atrocities of the country's 10-year civil war.
The report, released yesterday, cites 'substantial proof' that General Rene
Emilio Ponce, who resigned as defence minister on Friday, and four other
military officers ordered the killing of six Jesuit priests in 1989. It says
the late Mr Roberto D'Aubuisson, extreme right-wing leader of the Arena
party, ordered the murder of Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980. The US-trained
Atlacatl battalion was held responsible for the massacre of a thousand
civilians at El Mozote in 1981.
The murders, assassinations and other human rights abuses were committed
during a civil year that pitted the US-backed army and civilian government
against left-wing guerrillas. The US gave the army and government around
Dollars 6bn in aid during the 1980s, despite accusations by human rights
observers that the Salvadoran military was guilty of the crimes now
described in the report.
The two sides reached a peace agreement last year, with the Salvadoran
government agreeing to give the rebels land, purge the military, and reform
the police and judiciary, and set up a commission to investigate the worst
acts of violence.
The UN report was written by Mr Belisario Betancur, former Colombian
president, Mr Reynald Figueredo, former Venezuelan foreign minister, and US
jurist Mr Thomas Burgenthal.
They also accuse leaders of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front of killing and kidnapping civilians, mayors of cities under government
control, dissidents in the rebel movement, judges and US military personnel.
The commission urged that those named in the report be barred from public
office for 10 years, and be prohibited from ever holding military or
security responsibility. It called for a special investigation into the
death squads that killed tens of thousands of Salvadorans in the 1980s,
believing that they continue to be a 'potential menace'.
According to the commission Gen Ponce, Gen Juan Orlando Zepeda, deputy
defence minister, and Gen Juan Rafael Bustillo, former air force commander,
met on the eve of the murder of the six Jesuits, their housekeeper and her
daughter and ordered Colonel Guillermo Benavides to have them killed
'without any witnesses'. Col Benavides was convicted of the Jesuits' murder,
and is serving a 30-year prison sentence.
At a ceremony in New York to release the report, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary general, appeared to offer some support to Mr Cristiani's
amnesty proposal.
Observing that the country had made great strides, but that peace-building
was far from over, Mr Boutros Ghali said Mr Cristiani deserved the
international community's encouragements in his efforts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New York Post yesterday filed for bankruptcy protection and failed to
publish amid a newsroom mutiny.
The seemingly indestructible tabloid has bounced back from the verge of
death several times in recent years, but the latest crisis may prove fatal.
It was triggered by a staff revolt following plans to sack about 270 people
by the Post's latest potential publisher, Mr Abe Hirschfeld.
On Friday, a bankruptcy court judge ruled that property investor Mr
Hirschfeld could acquire the paper. He immediately ordered dismissal of the
editor and threatened to fire about a third of its staff.
Although the paper's current owner, property developer Mr Peter Kalikow,
filed for protection from creditors in 1991, the paper was not part of his
bankruptcy petition. Mr Kalikow continued to run the paper until January,
when bank pressure forced him to put it up for sale. The Post lost about
Dollars 5m last year.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Philosophical investors push up
share prices despite probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDETERRED by the almost daily spectacle of new boardroom-level arrivals
into Milan's decrepit San Vittore prison on corruption allegations, Italian
shares have risen by about 12 per cent this year.
The resilience of equities to the revelations now involving most leading
companies suggests that most investors are unconcerned by the arrests.
Rather than tumbling with each new leak about kickbacks on contracts, the
capitalisation of most companies has surged in 1993.
The reasons lie in expectations of lower interest rates, the benefits of a
cheaper lira for exporters and last summer's deal between unions and
employers to abolish the scala mobile wage indexation system. Concern about
corruption has so far been contained to a handful of cases.
The pace of the rises also reflects many investors' under-weight positions
in Italian stocks. Once sentiment began to shift last month, topping up
depleted portfolios created a bandwagon effect. 'Once the ball started
rolling, most investors had to start buying not to miss the market's
performance, even if they had doubts about the fundamentals,' says one
analyst.
Concern about individual arrests has been brushed aside in the context of
broader corporate prospects. 'Institutional investors understand that the
companies are still in business. Arresting Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli,
Fiat's chief financial officer, doesn't mean it has stopped making cars. The
question is whether the new Uno will be a good car, not whether a given
executive is in jail,' says Mr Gianluca Codagnone, an analyst at Milan
brokers Aloisio, Foglia, Ventura.
Fiat's share price has climbed steadily this year, reaching L5,560
yesterday. That compares with L4,810 on February 17 last year, when Mr Mario
Chiesa, the Socialist administrator whose testimony triggered the
investigations, was arrested.
Yet the general rise in prices on the bourse masks differing sectoral
performances. Construction has been hit hardest. Shares in Fiat's
Cogefar-Impresit building subsidiary have dropped to L2,730 from L3,443 when
Mr Chiesa was arrested. Last May, Mr Enzo Papi, the group's former managing
director, spent 55 days in San Vittore under interrogation by magistrates.
The virtual freeze in public works contracts still dampens the sector's
performance.
The problems in the building sector have spilled over into related
industries. Italmobiliare, the holding company for Mr Giampiero Pesenti, the
industrialist detained last month and now freed, have sunk to L40,000 from
L64,200 when Mr Chiesa was arrested last year. Italmobiliare's main
subsidiary is Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement group. Like other cement
and building materials concerns, it has been hurt by the building slowdown
and problems at Ciments Francais, the French cement maker it bought last
year.
Companies dominated by single individuals embroiled in the investigations
have also suffered disproportionately. Shares in the Filippo Fochi plant
engineering group tumbled on the arrest of Mr Roberto Fochi, its chairman
and managing director. His subsequent release from jail, combined with a big
Iranian contract, was greeted by a marked recovery in the stock price.
Sometimes negative factors have coincided, triggering particularly sharp
falls. The Premafin group of Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Milan property
magnate arrested on corruption charges last year, stands out.
Shares in Mr Ligresti's Grassetto building concern have tumbled by more than
half since Mr Chiesa's arrest. Premafin's share price fall has been even
more dramatic, reflecting the role of Mr Ligresti in the group. Premafin's
shares have plummeted to L5,500 from L11,075 in mid-February 1992.
Shares have also fallen in a handful of cases where investors believe
companies may face one-off costs as a result of the investigations. Ferruzzi
Finanziaria, one of Italy's biggest private-sector holding companies, and
Montedison, its big chemicals and agro-industrial arm, both saw their shares
slide when magistrates turned their attention to the ill-fated Enimont
chemicals joint venture.
Enimont was wound up in late 1990 when the state-owned Eni energy and
chemicals group bought out Montedison's 40 per cent stake. The L2,800bn
price paid is now under examination, amid allegations of deliberate
over-valuation linked to kickbacks to political parties.
The Enimont inquiries have already involved some of Italy's best-known
entrepreneurs. Mr Raul Gardini, chairman of Montedison's parent company at
the time, and Mr Sergio Cragnotti, former Ferruzzi executive who used to be
Enimont's managing director, have been told by magistrates they are under
investigation.
In spite of the uncertainty created by the investigations, many analysts
believe the corruption scandal will eventually help Italian companies. 'It
will eventually be much easier for the market to judge companies on their
skills and competitiveness, rather than the quality of their political
contacts,' says Mr Codagnone.
The demise of contracting through private tenders, which paved the way for
many of the inflated public-sector deals now under investigation, may even
help some state groups facing heavy investment programmes.
One analyst points out that at least part of a contract - the part which
might have represented kickbacks - would not now have to be paid.
Most of his colleagues fear the close scrutiny likely to be given to big
contracts may slow decision-making.
However, they agree the greater transparency that should ensue will cut
costs and improve efficiency in the end.

laundrymen

IT SEEMS that whenever there is an Italian scandal, there is a Swiss
connection.
From the Chiasso affair in the late 1970s through to the Tangentopoli affair
that is now shaking Italy's entire political system, Swiss banks always
appear in a prominent, if rather sleazy, role.
Last week yet another connection emerged when Mr Pierfrancesco Pacini
Battaglia was named as one of the main intermediaries funnelling kickbacks
from Eni, the Italian state energy group, to political parties.
Mr Pacini Battaglia, now under arrest, apparently managed his funds through
a small Geneva private bank called Banque Karfinco, of which he is a
director.
Now, however, there are signs that not only the Italians, but also the
Swiss, are tiring of what has been a mutually convenient arrangement for
decades.
Last weekend, police in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino confirmed that
Mrs Carla Del Ponte, the chief prosecutor, has been receiving special
protection for several months. She has been particularly vigorous in
investigating Mafia cases.
Later this year, the Swiss federal government plans to pass a package of
tough penal law reforms aimed at preventing criminals everywhere from using
Swiss banks.
And leaders of the Swiss financial community are urging the authorities to
accelerate appeal procedures behind which suspects have been able to hide
for years.
'The appeal process is too complicated. It is not in our interest to slow
down the process,' Mrs Gertrud Erismann of Union Bank of Switzerland says.
UBS is the other Swiss bank that has been publicly linked so far with the
political corruption scandals in Italy. Mr Silvano Larini, a close associate
of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Italian prime minister, opened the so-called
'Protezione' account at UBS's Lugano branch in 1979.
Over the subsequent two years, Mr Roberto Calvi, then president of Banco
Ambrosiano, paid Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.9m) into it, and it is alleged that Mr
Craxi and Mr Claudio Martelli, the former justice minister, subsequently had
access to the account.
UBS was embarrassed by demands from the Geneva police last autumn for
information on the account, which were accompanied by an insistence that the
client not be informed. UBS felt obliged to appeal on behalf of the client,
even though it did not want to hinder the investigation. Geneva police have
since allowed the client to be informed and UBS has withdrawn from the
appeal.
Switzerland was slow in responding to changing international attitudes to
dirty money. In the early 1980s, Bern enraged US authorities by being less
than helpful in US demands for help in a few insider trading investigations.
In the late 1980s, the country came to be seen as a main centre for drug
money laundering, especially by the Italian Mafia. A 1989 federal
parliamentary commission accused the public prosecutor of laxity in pursuing
narcotics investigations, and a book with the cheeky title Switzerland
Washes Whiter became a best seller.
As so often though, once the Swiss decided to act, they moved quickly and
effectively. In August 1990, amendments to the penal code were passed making
it an offence for a Swiss banker knowingly to accept money that had been
made from criminal activities.
The Swiss Federal Banking Commission backed up the new laws by making clear
that it would regard the acceptance of dirty money through negligence as a
possible contravention of the banking law's stipulation that the conduct of
business be above reproach. Also, banks were henceforth obliged to know the
real beneficial owners of their accounts.
This tightening has already had a significant impact. According to one
leading Lugano banker, any Italian who reveals that he comes from southern
Italy stands little chance of opening an account in Switzerland these days.
However, it does have weaknesses. Swiss bankers point out, for example, that
many of the individuals being named in the current Italian scandal would
have been welcomed as clients because of their high standing.
Now a second reform package is on the way. Justice ministry officials say it
will make membership in a criminal organisation an offence. This is
particularly significant with respect to the Mafia and the P2 Masonic Lodge.
Switzerland has treaties of mutual assistance on criminal cases with most
countries, including Italy. However, the Swiss will only co-operate with a
foreign government if the crime being pursued is also a crime in
Switzerland. Thus, it will become easier for the Italian authorities to
pursue Mafia and P2 cases in Switzerland.
The new law will also give Swiss bankers the right, if they are suspicious
of a client, to tell the police without risking prosecution for violating
bank secrecy. This will bring an end to the potential for conflicts of
interest that tormented bankers after the 1990 reforms.
The Justice department also intends to set up a specialised office for
dealing with organised crime and to establish liaison officers abroad,
notably in Washington and at Lyons, the headquarters of Interpol.
All this does not mean that Swiss banks are going out of the financial haven
business. For Italians, or anyone else, seeking to avoid tax, it is business
as usual. Tax evasion is not a criminal offence in Switzerland.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Foreign competitors may win the
ultimate kickback - Scandal threatens to count against Italian companies
seeking public sector deals at home and abroad
</HEADLINE>

BUSINESS as usual is the motto at most Italian companies, whether the
minority tainted by arrests and allegations of paying kickbacks or the vast
majority so far unaffected.
However, the unwinding scandal has not gone unnoticed by Italy's exporters
or the thousands of foreign companies operating subsidiaries in the country.
Leading exporters largely brush off the effects of the scandal on their
businesses, describing the affair as being limited to domestic public-sector
contracts. However, there are already signs that their foreign competitors
may be trying to turn matters to their advantage.
So far, there have been no examples of big contracts being lost. However,
with other European markets in recession and competition in many of the
industrial sectors in which Italians specialise growing ever more
cut-throat, it may not be long before an important deal slips through a
company's fingers because of the impact of the scandal.
Some state-owned companies may already be feeling the impact. Italstrade,
the big civil engineering arm of the Iri state holding company, believes it
may have lost its chances of winning a tunneling contract for London
Underground's Jubilee line extension because of financial problems at its
parent and adverse publicity.
The company, which is part of IRI's loss-making Iritecna building and
general contracting subsidiary, has already signed a letter of intent to
build a tunnel under the Thames for a section of the new line. But hopes to
construct a further part from London Bridge Station appear to be receding
after requests for more information and guarantees about the position of the
parent company.
Mr Eberhard von Koerber, the deputy chairman of the multinational ABB
engineering group, who is also responsible at board level for the Italian
market, has had ample reason to get to know the Italian market. ABB is
believed to be interested in both the big state-owned engineering groups on
the privatisation list - Nuovo Pignone, the turbines and compressors
subsidiary of the Eni energy and chemicals concern and Breda Costruzioni
Ferroviarie, the railway equipment group owned by the Efim state holding
company, now in voluntary liquidation.
Mr Von Koerber was blunt: '. . . The Italian managers with whom I met to
discuss (privatisation) are either in jail, disappear at night, or have been
fired. That would be inconceivable in Germany.'
Last week, Mr Franco Ciatti, Nuovo Pignone's chairman, was arrested on
allegations linked to the corruption scandal. So far, the investigations
have not touched BCF.
But ABB itself has been caught up in the net. Earlier this year, Mr Umberto
di Capua, head of its big Italian subsidiary, was arrested and briefly
detained in San Vittore prison on allegations of kickbacks linked to orders
for Milan's new third metro line. The allegations followed the interrogation
last year of Mr Ivo Braglia, another ABB executive.
'We all knew that in Italy, things tended to be done differently than in
other countries,' said Mr Von Koerber. 'But if there's a strong state role
in the economy and legislation which is not very clear on financing parties,
it's possible to arrive at the sort of situation which is now being
dismantled.'
Italian exporters have had a strong reputation for innovation, technical
expertise and a strong commercial sense. Of late their competitive edge has
been sharpened by the devaluation of the lira against most major currencies.
But with stiff competition in the markets, few should be surprised if their
foreign competitors start benefiting as the domestic corruption scandal
rumbles on.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Privatisation candidates in the
spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S ambitious privatisation programme avoided the taint of the growing
scandals until last week, when a series of raids by Milan magistrates
against subsidiaries of Eni, the state energy and chemicals group, brought
prime candidates for privatisation directly under the scandal spotlight.
Last Monday Mr Franco Ciatti, chairman of the Nuovo Pignone turbines
subsidiary of Eni, was arrested on corruption charges, along with Mr
Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman, who was also accused of illegal funding
of political parties.
On Wednesday night, Mr Raffaele Santoro, Mr Pio Pigorini and Mr Giovanni
dell'Orto, chairmen of Eni's Agip petroleum, Snam gas distribution and
Saipem exploration subsidiaries respectively, were detained on charges of
illegal party funding and falsifying company accounts.
Nuovo Pignone is one of the most prominent candidates for privatisation,
while both Agip and Snam had been hoping to float part of their capital
under a long-heralded scheme to bring in private shareholders.
The latest developments will complicate a privatisation programme which had
already received a cool response from potential buyers. Recession and
unattractive strings attached to some of the biggest privatisation
candidates mostly explain the lack of enthusiasm.
But matters have been exacerbated by differences within the government over
privatisation. Last month for example, Prime Minister Giuliano Amato tried
to push aside Mr Giuseppe Guarino, his industry minister, who had become a
substantial obstacle to privatisation.
Mr Guarino's refusal to resign his portfolio in favour of Mr Paolo Baratta,
who was later appointed privatisation supremo, highlighted the continuing
strength of the political opposition to piecemeal sell-offs. Ministers hope
the transfer of responsibilities for privatisation from the Industry
Ministry will help get the programme off the ground.
Only a handful of transactions have been concluded since the government made
privatisation one of its priorities after taking office last year. And the
deals which have been completed are small in scale compared with those still
to be sold.
Still pending are the disposals of Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth biggest
bank, and Nuovo Pignone. both of which were announced in September. Another
big privatisation yet to be concluded is that of the food production side of
the SME foods, retailing and catering group, and the planned flotation of an
initial stake in the Ina insurance group.
SME should be the easiest to sell. The disposal of its food manufacturing
activities - and possibly its supermarkets and catering business at a later
stage - was advertised this month, and the deal should cause few problems.
But it could still go awry if opponents of the sale try to use the courts to
block the complex division of the group into the three or four separate
companies essential to the disposals.
Moreover, SME's Naples headquarters are occupied by dissident workers
opposing the proposed break-up. They have prevented the retrieval of
important documentation needed to pave the way for a sell-off.
There are convincing reasons for the delays in bringing other transactions
to fruition. For example, it is believed that Merrill Lynch, the US
investment bank sounding out buyers for Credito Italiano, has failed to find
a suitable candidate.
Its remit has been complicated by the likely L6,000bn (Pounds 2.7bn) price
tag for the 67 per cent stake held by the Iri state holding company and the
public tender offer that would subsequently be required under new bourse
laws for the remaining shares floating on the stock market.
The sale has also been stymied by poor timing by the government. Efforts to
dispose of the well-regarded bank have been complicated by the forthcoming
sale of Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's most prestigious
financial institutions. Many buyers, especially the consortia of domestic
financial and insurance interests seen as the most likely candidates, are
waiting for BCI to come on the block.
The outlook for selling the big Treasury-owned IMI investment banking and
insurance concern to a group of savings banks, led by Milan's Cariplo,
remains unclear as the long-running saga, now well into its second year,
rolls on.
Nuovo Pignone should have been relatively easy to sell, given its strong
reputation for turbines and compressors. However, Mr Ciatti's arrest and the
fact that much of its business comes from Eni complicates assessments of its
value and saleability. The works' council at Nuovo Pignone's Florence
headquarters this week called for privatisation to be suspended.
Plans to float Agip and Snam have also been tainted by the corruption
scandal. The latest setback comes on top of existing differences in the
government over Eni. While some officials want the flotations, probably
involving 10-20 per cent of the shares in each subsidiary, to go ahead
quickly, others are still pressing for a flotation of Eni itself.
The latest wave of arrests at the group could, surprisingly, speed that
process. While the next few months are likely to be turbulent, the call for
a 'fresh start' - probably linked to privatisation - could prove
irresistible. The blow to some of the group's most powerful subsidiaries,
which were previously stressing their independence, may strengthen the hand
of those calling for flotation of the group, rather than its subsidiaries.
The Ina insurance group represents one of the government's most attractive
candidates. Yet an embarrassing and highly public difference of opinion
between the group's chairman and managing director over its restructuring
means plans to privatise the company could still be delayed.
Setbacks to the government's timetable mean some smaller privatisations may
jump the queue. Prominently placed until last week's arrests were Eni's
Savio textile machinery operation and the Agip Coal natural resources
operation. However, both transactions may now be held up.
Progress may also be forthcoming in disposing of some of the more attractive
assets of the Efim state holding company, now in voluntary liquidation.
Formal bids for Efim's big Siv glass subsidiary are expected to be invited
later this month.
There has also been considerable behind-the-scenes activity among potential
buyers for Efim's Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie railway equipment maker. In
both cases, however, the proceeds will be little more than a drop in the
ocean of the government's overall privatisation targets, given the modest
financial performance of the two companies.
