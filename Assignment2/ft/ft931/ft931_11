FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Magistrates hold key to
unlocking Tangentopoli - They will set the investigation agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<TEXT>
OVER the weekend the Italian media felt obliged to comment on a non-event.
No new arrests had taken place in any of the country's ever more numerous
corruption scandals which centre on the illicit funding of political parties
through bribes on contracts.
Such arrests are now such a part of daily life that it is an occasion when
nothing happens. But this is only a pause.
The anti-corruption drive has gone too far to be halted easily and is now
attacking the heart of the post-war politico-economic system. The
traditional balance of power has altered and the politicians no longer
control the judiciary; or rather that part of the judiciary which matters,
the investigating magistrates.
A weak government and a fractious parliament have tried, and failed, to
impose a political solution which would limit the scope and consequences of
the corruption investigations. As a result the magistrates, particularly
those in Milan, are setting the agenda. The speed and scope of the
investigations will be determined for the foreseeable future by the ability
and willingness of the magistrates to proceed. The public is firmly behind
them. Anger is rising as proof accumulates of what has been little short of
the rape of the state during the last two decades.
The need for a political solution, which prime minister Giuliano Amato began
to explore last month, was and remains real. If Italy's system has been so
permeated by corruption, the very institutions of democracy risk being
weakened if the judicial surgery is too abrupt and all-embracing.
Second, there is the issue of how guilt is apportioned in such a corrupt
system, and whether individuals are to be punished or whether society as a
whole should be blamed. Finally, the sheer volume of work at both the
investigative, prosecution and the appeal stage threatens to bring an
already torpid and bureaucratic judicial system to a standstill.
Italy cannot afford to have the corruption scandals carried through the
courts for the next six to 10 years without political instability and
serious economic disruption. Already, Italian companies are worried about
their image abroad.
It is now clear that the scope for investigation is limitless. What started
out a year ago with Milan being dubbed Tangentopolis (literally bribe city)
has become Tangentopoli (bribe cities).
Large and small cities alike have seen their favourite sons indicted or
their reputations ruined. Milan, Naples, Turin and Rome - the four biggest
cities - are without political guidance as the ruling coalitions have been
decimated by a combination of arrests and alliances broken in the fall-out
from corruption scandals.
In northern and central Italy the political elite is on the retreat, if not
disappearing. Political control of the public sector, through state
companies and thousands of municipally owned entities, which has been the
central element in the corrupting process, has been undermined. To some
extent all the big state concerns are involved - Iri, the state holding
company; Enel, the electricity authority; Efim, the industrial holding
company in liquidation; Eni, the state energy company and Anas, the roads
authority.
The enormous bounty of power station contracts in Enel's patronage is
emerging as a key source of bribes paid by contractors to the political
parties. But Eni is rapidly becoming the centre of attention. Last week, Mr
Gabriele Cagliari, the Eni chairman, along with the heads of the company's
four main subsidiaries, was arrested on charges of illicit party funding and
falsifying accounts.
Magistrates are investigating three main areas of Eni activity:
The involvement of Eni with Banco Ambrosiano prior to the latter's collapse
in 1982, and the payment into a Swiss bank account of money for the
Socialists;
The reorganisation of the chemicals industry with Ferruzzi's Montedison in
1989-90;
The use of Eni's subsidiaries in providing funds to parties based on foreign
contracts (such as gas supplies from Algeria) and the profits derived from
dealing in oil and other hydrocarbon commodities through Swiss associates.
All these promise explosive revelations concerning the scale of money taken
by individuals and the parties through manipulation of state companies, as
well as exposing the 'Swiss connection' in Italian business dealings. The
issue of individual enrichment in taking kickbacks has not been touched. At
least 30 per cent of the L5,000bn - L6,000bn (Pounds 2.7bn) believed to have
been taken annually in 'commissions' went not to political parties but to
individuals in kind or cash. Milan magistrates have left this issue to one
side.
Other areas which have yet to fall within the magistrates' net include
government investment and procurement for the railways, which is planning
massive investment in a high-speed train network, and the defence sector.
The civil service itself is only just beginning to be touched with
investigations into public works, overseas aid controlled by the Foreign
Ministry and export credit guarantees.
Equally, the investigations remain essentially a phenomenon of north and
central Italy. This is because the grip of the Christian Democrats and
Socialists remains strongest in the south and the judiciary there is more
susceptible to political pressure. In the south, too, the thrust of
magistrates' energy tends to be directed at organised crime.
The party most visibly affected has been the Socialists, but smaller parties
have also suffered.
The only parties to emerge with a clean sheet so far are the communist
splinter group, Reconstructed Communism, La Rete (The Network, the
Sicily-based reform movement), the neo-fascist MSI and the Lombard League,
whose rise to power derives precisely from its opposition to the corrupt old
system in the north.
These are calling for the corrupt to be punished and would probably be the
main beneficiaries if elections were held under the present system of
proportional representation. Yet even they recognise that the old system is
unworkable in the long term. Only a new parliament elected on a fresh set of
electoral regulations is likely to have the moral authority to deal with the
issues raised by Tangentopoli.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: A tale from two cities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rome: The wreckage wrought on the body politic
May 1992
The effects of the scandal reach the capital. Milan's magistrates ponder
whether to ask parliament to waive immunity on the outgoing Socialist
minister of tourism and a recently re-elected Socialist deputy who is also
the brother-in-law of Bettino Craxi, the long-time leader of the Socialist
party and former prime minister. Craxi is widely expected to head the
government being formed in the wake of last months' national election
stalemate.
Jun 1992
The outgoing minister for public works is served notice by Rome's
magistrates that he is under investigation. Craxi agrees to withdraw
candidature for prime minister. Giuliano Amato, former Socialist treasury
minister and head of the special commission looking into Milan scandal,
forms government.
Jul 1992
Chamber of Deputies agrees to waive parliamentary immunity on five MPs. A
total of 13 MPs and former ministers are now under investigation by Milan
magistrates. Nine more are being investigated in other parts of the country.
Dec 1992
Craxi is told he is under investigation by Milan magistrates. Parliament
agrees to waive immunity of Socialist deputy leader and former foreign
minister Gianni de Michelis so that Venice magistrates can investigate
allegations against him. Socialist party executive postpones decision on
Craxi's leadership.
Jan 1993
Craxi served with second notice by Milan magistrates, who ask parliament to
waive his immunity. The plight of Mr Craxi and the Socialist leadership
again raises question mark over fate of Amato coalition, in which Socialists
are principal partners alongside Christian Democrats. Rome magistrates
investigate purchase by Treasury of buildings in Rome. Forty-four people,
including senior civil servants and a former treasury director-general, are
charged. Police raid offices of Socialists.
Feb 1993
Claudio Martelli, Socialist justice minister, resigns after being told he is
under investigation in Milan. The number of separate investigation notices
to Craxi increases to six. Craxi resigns as party leader after 16 years in
the job. Gabriele Cagliari, president of Eni, told by Rome magistrates he is
under investigation. Two under-secretaries in Budget and Interior ministries
are warned. Prominent figures in parties other than Socialists are
increasingly involved in investigations. Health minister Francesco De
Lorenzo resigns after deputies vote to remove immunity. Finance minister
Giovanni Goria resigns. Although not under recent judicial investigation, he
has been embroiled in another long-running investigation. Tension rises as
magistrates in Rome, Milan and other cities order a wave of arrests.
Republican party leader Giorgio La Malfa resigns immediately after being
informed he is under investigation. More than 50 deputies and senators are
now caught up in the various investigations.
Mar 1993
A hitherto obscure television programme presenting court cases becomes mass
viewing. Craxi says magistrates are in co-ordinated plan to decapitate
Socialist influence. Amato's four-party coalition agrees on legislation that
would transfer the investigation of illegal political funding from
magistrates to politically appointed regional prefects. There is public
uproar, Milan magistrates object, Environment minister Carlo Ripa di Meana
resigns in protest, and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refuses to sign the
government's decree that would open way for a political solution. Amato wins
backing of coalition parties after turbulent parliamentary debate, but
widespread protest continues. Amato leaves proposed legislation with a
divided parliament. More than 1,000 senior politicians and businessmen are
now under investigation, but this is likely to prove to be only the tip of
the iceberg.
Milan: The sword hanging over the business community
Feb 1992
The beginnings of what will become known as 'the Milan corruption scandal'
is revealed almost accidentally. A Socialist apparatchik is caught taking a
L7m (Pounds 3,200) kickback for a cleaning contract at an old peoples' home.
Milan's magistrates have been on trail of corruption ever since.
May 1992
The scandal enters its third month with the charging of two leading figures
in the construction industry. Six other prominent people in the industry
have already been charged. Most notably, Enzo Papi, managing director of
Fiat's big building subsidiary, is detained. In all, 26 businessmen,
municipal officials and local politicians have now been arrested.
Jun 1992
Number of accused prominent businessmen and politicians rises to more than
40. Police announce that a prominent Socialist killed himself after going to
see authorities investigating alleged city hall corruption in Milan.
Jul 1992
Salvatore Ligresti, the king of construction in Milan and one of Italy's
richest men, is arrested and shares in companies under his control fall
sharply. Seventy-six local and national politicians have been either charged
or are under investigation and focus is shifting to industrialists. Scandals
claim second suicide victim with death of head of Como-based building group.
Dec 1992
The lira, already buffeted by turmoil in the ERM, for the first time comes
under pressure because of Italy's political uncertainty. The government
unfreezes L10,000bn (Pounds 4.4bn) in payments overdue to construction
companies for public works contracts. Disbursement had been delayed by
corruption inquiries.
Jan 1993
Magistrates announce that Paolo Berlusconi, the younger brother of media
magnate Silvio Berlusconi, will be put on trial. He is latest of 35
businessmen and politicians who magistrates say will go to trial.
Magistrates widen investigations to include reorganisation of chemicals
industry in 1990. Under investigation are Eni, the state oil concern, the
Ferruzzi Group's Montedison, and Anas, the state road building authority.
The number of persons arrested since the beginning of the scandal passes
100.
Feb 1993
Financial markets are rattled by fears of political chaos. Heavy selling of
shares, and the lira slides. Intervention restores calm to markets. A total
of 105 businessmen, politicians and civil servants are said to have
confessed to taking part in a system whereby public contracts were awarded
on the basis of illicit payments to fund party organisations. Latest line of
investigation centres on the electricity generating industry. More arrests,
increasingly involving prominent business figures. Two top Fiat executives
are arrested in their Turin homes, one of whom is the group's chief
financial officer. Magistrates announce that Raul Gardini, former head of
Ferruzzi-Montedison, is under investigation.
Mar 1993
Milan magistrates order arrests linked to reconstruction work in 1987
Valtellina floods disaster. Two officials of state road-building agency Anas
among those held. Italy's credit ratings begin to be affected. Standard &amp;
Poor's announces downgrading after Moody's places the country's debt under
review. The move by Moody's provokes rebuttal from Bank of Italy and
Treasury which accuse agency of failing to take account of measures to
tackle public sector deficit. Gabriele Cagliari, president of Eni, arrested.
Share prices fall, and Bank of Italy forced to support lira. Calm restored
to markets. Chairmen of four big Eni subsidiaries arrested, and police raid
group's operating headquarters. Head of Sace, the state-run export credit
guarantee agency, arrested.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Politicians start feeling
downside of family ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOSE-KNIT nature of the Italian family is proving to have some
disadvantages as the reputations of politicians and businessmen become
damaged by close relatives caught up in the scandals.
Take the case of Mr Francesco de Lorenzo, a member of the Liberal party who
resigned on February 19 as minister of health. That morning his 89-year-old
father, Ferruccio, had been arrested on allegations that he received an
illegal commission of L1.7bn (Pounds 741,000) for a series of property
deals. Mr de Lorenzo owed his political career to contacts of his father in
his political fiefdom of Naples.
His father, a prominent Naples doctor, has been three times a parliamentary
deputy, a former under-secretary of health and for years head of the
national medical association. The allegations of corruption centred on the
property purchases for the doctors' health insurance association which
Ferruccio de Lorenzo headed.
Although resignation is rare in Italian politics, Francesco de Lorenzo, as
minister in charge of the medical profession, was left with little
alternative.
The activities of Mr Michele de Mita forced his well-known elder brother,
Ciriaco, to resign from his key post as head of the joint parliamentary
constitutional reform commission on March 2. This followed Michele's arrest
in connection with an alleged foodstuffs fraud linked to the 1980 earthquake
at Irpinia, southern Italy.
Ciriaco, a former Christian Democrat prime minister and heavyweight on the
left of the party, is the local potentate around Avellino, one of the areas
most affected by the earthquake and where misuse of disaster relief funds
has been most keenly felt.
Others have been more fortunate in limiting the damage caused by the
involvement of some family members with the law. Mr Bruno Tronchetti
Provera, head of Mariani, a company involved in a consortium setting up a
gas distribution network in Milan, was arrested for allegedly paying a bribe
of L1.6bn (Pounds 697,000) to a Republican party politician. Although Bruno
is brother of Marco, chief executive of Pirelli, and although Mariani is
linked by shareholdings to the tyre group, the two have managed to stay
separate.
On the other hand the higher public profile of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
media magnate, has also brought his links with the Socialists under
scrutiny; and he has had to make very clear that his Fininvest is no longer
involved in Milan property dealings.
Mr Craxi, who risks losing parliamentary immunity to face charges of alleged
corruption, never ceases to castigate the press and the magistrature for
singling out his family for vilification.
According to Mr Mario Chiesa, a Socialist party functionary and the first
person caught in the scandal and to confess to Milan magistrates, he helped
'Bobo' (Bettino's son) into politics using funds illicitly collected from
contract kickbacks. 'Bobo' has now withdrawn from politics.
Stefania, Bettino's daughter, has been portrayed by the press as unfairly
benefiting from her father's influence and the Socialists' control of the
second state television channel to set up a TV production company.
Mr Craxi is also foisted with the plight of his brother-in-law, Mr Paolo
Pillitieri, former mayor of Milan, who faces charges of illicit party
financing.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Billions paid in public sector
contract bribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FROM confessions of businessmen, politicians and civil servants it has
become clear that virtually all transactions from the mid-1980s onwards in
the public sector were subject to bribes and commissions. This was also true
of a considerable slice of private construction activity, as well as supply
contracts.
How much was creamed off in bribes and illicit commissions each year? How
much did this cost the economy?
Total public spending in 1992 was L135,000bn (Pounds 59bn)-L70,000bn (Pounds
30bn) on the purchase of goods and services and L65,000bn (Pounds 28bn) in
investments.
According to confessions to the investigating magistrates, supply contracts
routinely carried a commission of between 5 and 10 per cent.
Public works contracts, which totalled L30,000bn, carried a 3 per cent
commission. But this rose to 4 per cent in the case of private treaty deals
with Anas, the roads authority (which accounted for 10 per cent of public
works contracts).
Building permits and property development permissions carried a commission
of 6-8 per cent of the value of the project. The construction industry had a
turnover of L156,000bn in 1992.
On a crude median of 5 per cent for both supply and investment projects, and
total public spending of L135,000bn in 1992 - then L6,750bn (Pounds 3bn) was
paid out last year in bribes. If this is reduced because some expenditure
reflects projects on which commissions have already been paid, then the
figure could be cut to a minimum of L5,000bn (Pounds 2.2bn).
But this figure only includes public sector spending. Public works contracts
represent a mere 20 per cent of the construction industry's annual turnover
of L156,000bn.
When building permits and permissions for property developments are factored
in, it would not be unreasonable to put a figure of around L6,000bn (Pounds
2.6bn) per year being creamed off.
How much of this went into private pockets and how much to the political
parties is hard to tell.
According to those who have confessed to the magistrates, at least 30-40 per
cent of total bribes paid went directly to personal enrichment - much more
in the case of the private construction sector and the granting of building
permits.
It is also difficult to distinguish between benefits in kind which have been
connected to party work - free travel, gifts, apartments, telephones,
etc-and direct self-enrichment.
The cost to the economy has to be measured partly by:
the extent to which contract values are increased to absorb the
bribes/commissions;
the increased cost of contracts due to the absence of competition. Ministry
officials say public works contracts could well have been inflated by 15 per
cent or more.
There is also the hidden cost of high public spending, reflected in the
public sector deficit equivalent to almost 11 per cent of gross domestic
product and the expense of both borrowing and servicing Italy's huge
national debt, equivalent to about 107 per cent of GDP.
This latter element is extremely important: if at the beginning of the 1980s
corruption had a silver lining, in that it encouraged greater private
consumption expenditure and even investment into the economy, by the end of
the 1980s the accumulated impact was simply to fuel ever-higher public
spending, thus substantially raising the national debt.

FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Delors to meet Clinton on trade row - The
meeting may offer an opportunity to defuse escalating US-EC tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, European Commission President, will hold talks with
President Bill Clinton in Washington on Thursday, a long-planned meeting
which will offer a chance to defuse the escalation in EC-US trade tensions.
A senior EC official said Mr Delors would urge Mr Clinton to resist the
temptation to act unilaterally to resolve trade disputes and to co-operate
with the EC on a growth initiative to revive the world economy. 'This is an
important meeting for them to start a good working relationship,' the
official said.
The Clinton administration's focus on rebuilding US competitiveness has
unnerved Brussels, where fears of a resurgent America taking advantage of a
politically and economically weakened EC are rife. Mr Delors himself has
occasionally raised the threat of US hegemony, rather than the balanced
partnership of equals.
The EC was taken aback last Friday after the Clinton administration
unexpectedly withdrew from talks aimed at settling a dispute over 'Buy
European' and 'Buy American' clauses covering rules for government
procurement. The move escalated tensions already inflamed by EC-US
disagreements on commercial aircraft subsidies, steel subsidies and the
stalled Gatt Round.
Last Friday, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said the US would
'most probably' bar European companies from winning certain federal
contracts in telecommunications and power generation, starting from March
22.
A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external affairs, said
the Commission was considering all options, including retaliation.
EC officials described the US trade representative as 'unpredictable.' His
abrupt decision to call off negotiations embarrassed Sir Leon who claimed a
recent trip to Washington had cemented relations with him.
Mr Kantor broke off negotiations after learning the EC would not waive
Article 29 in the EC utilities directive which gives EC companies a 3 per
cent price preference over foreigners and favoured treatment to EC bidders
offering more than 50 per cent local content.

FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Brussels 'open skies'ambitions scotched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC transport ministers yesterday agreed to co-ordinate more closely the
external civil aviation agreements each member state now negotiates
bilaterally.
But they scotched European Commission ambitions to negotiate 'open skies'
deals on behalf of the EC as a bloc, except on a case-by-case basis
requiring a prior mandate from the Twelve.
The Commission said immediately it would take the EC Council of Ministers to
the European Court - 'in the next few days', said Mr Abel Matutes, transport
commissioner.
Brussels has long argued for a common external aviation policy to win better
access for EC airlines, and prevent a free-for-all inside Europe which might
put at risk its own hard-won deregulation of air transport.
But ministers decided member states 'shall remain fully responsible for
their relations with third countries in the field of aviation unless and
until action has been taken by the Council.'
The Council based itself on the transport articles of the EC treaty, whereas
the Commission maintains that external aviation agreements come under the
the treaty's commercial clauses, which give Brussels broad competence.
Ministers did agree, however, that the EC should establish common rules on
aviation relations with other countries. The Twelve and the Commission will
thus set up an experts group to:
Exchange information on and consult on external negotiations;
Sort out conflicts of interest between states, and possible infringements of
EC law;
Identify areas of common interest where the Community should negotiate as
Twelve.
They also agreed yesterday on common equipment standards for air traffic
control. These are aimed at integrating 54 control centres, using 31
incompatible systems and 70 different computer languages.

FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Kantor seeks new rules in free market game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN he cancelled this week's talks with the EC, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US
trade representative, was saying that the rules of the game must change.
His message was that his patience for the squabbling and last minute bandage
'solutions' which he believes have produced little gain for American
companies in the past was running out.
Senator John Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia, summed up the US
mood on Capitol Hill last week when he said: 'Our policy has been that we
are for free trade, that we are for improved market access and a Uruguay
Round, while our strategy has been, in any given crisis, to do the minimum
necessary to avoid some kind of congressional action. Neither that policy or
strategy has accomplished much.
'Marathon trade negotiations are now well into their seventh year. Our trade
deficits have begun to rise again. Numerous bilateral problems, particularly
with Europe, seem permanently on the table.'
Mr Kantor has said much the same, though more diplomatically, since taking
office.
Mr Kantor has repeatedly stated his aim: 'Comparably open markets.' The
'comparable' can be defined unilaterally by the US through sanctions or
through real negotiation. He has also clearly defined his key role as the
enforcer of US trade laws. The 1988 Trade Act required the administration to
report on the extent to which foreign governments discriminated against US
products and services in government procurement, and to act appropriately to
remove the discrimination.
In 1991 Mrs Carla Hills, then the US trade representative, said France,
Germany and Italy had discriminated against foreign suppliers of heavy
electrical equipment or telecommunications equipment. Consultations were
requested and Mrs Hills vowed that, if US concerns were not resolved within
60 days, the president would implement sanctions to take effect by January
1993.
Two months after that deadline, Mr Kantor is prepared to act. He would also
'be pleased to sit down with the EC,' he said.
Meanwhile, he has been taking comments from US companies, most of which
support the initial sanctions. There could be a second tranche of if the EC
retaliates - a move Mr Kantor said he does not expect.
Most US companies do not recommend the US withdraw from the Gatt procurement
code, a step Mr Kantor is considering. Many believe the US should bring a
complaint to Gatt on the grounds the EC utilities directive fails to provide
national treatment for US companies.
The EC can be pardoned for its 'surprise' at Mr Kantor's impatience. For
four years it dealt with a trade representative who believed it to be 'a
failure' if sanctions went into effect. Mr Kantor has seen the results of
past US accommodation. He has not liked what he sees.

NEGOTIATIONS on Chinese membership of Gatt resumed yesterday in Geneva, but
little progress is expected over the three days of talks following
unsuccessful discussions between China and the US earlier this month, writes
Frances Williams in Geneva.
Neither the US nor the EC has sent senior negotiators to Geneva, and part of
the US team has been delayed by severe weather. China had hoped to rejoin
Gatt this year, but US officials now say membership is a long way off.

FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Credit insurance protest in Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT proposal to allow Canada's Export Development Corporation to
enter the domestic credit insurance business has drawn strong protests from
British and US-owned insurance companies in Canada.
It is the most contentious part of a draft bill, expected to be introduced
in parliament this week.
The EDC, Canada's export finance and credit insurance agency, wants to
expand into underwriting domestic credit risks to help it win back export
business which it has lost in recent years to private-sector insurers
offering both domestic and export coverage.
The corporation has seen some of its biggest export accounts move to
foreign-owned underwriters, notably subsidiaries of Trade Indemnity of the
UK, and American International Companies and Continental Insurance of the
US.
These companies have expanded aggressively in Canada over the past few
years. Trade Indemnity, which set up in Ottawa in 1989, already underwrites
about CDollars 4bn in sales, split roughly equally between domestic and
export business. Mr Rick Doyle, its president, says: 'If big exporters have
found better service and one-stop shopping in the private sector, why should
the government come in?'
The private insurers complain that the EDC's status as a government agency
gives it many advantages, including tax-free status and the absence of
requirements to set up reserves against liabilities. 'It would be difficult
for us to compete against a company that could basically buy the market,' Mr
Doyle says.
The EDC declined to comment on the legislation until it is presented.
However, it is said to be concerned that the private insurers are
'cherry-picking', in other words, taking its biggest and best export
insurance customers, and leaving it with the more risky business from
mid-sized and small companies.
The new legislation will also expand the EDC's export-finance mandate, with
a view to making it more competitive with European and Japanese
export-finance agencies. The Corporation is expected to become more active
in pre-export financing, including the ability to make direct loans against
inventory and working capital assets. The EDC will also be empowered to
enhance a financing proposal by taking an equity stake in a company or a
project, and will be given greater leeway to provide support for leasing
machinery and equipment.
Canadian exporters have complained that the EDC's services are increasingly
falling behind those offered by other countries' export finance and credit
insurance agencies.

FT  16 MAR 93 / UN general hopeful of Bosnia aid breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Philippe Morillon, the French commander of United Nations forces in
Bosnia, said yesterday he was hopeful a convoy would bring aid to the
besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia today and evacuate
women and children.
The flamboyant general, who has set up a command post in Srebrenica in a
gesture of solidarity with its thousands of suffering people, made his
announcement after talks with General Ratko Mladic, the Serb commander, near
Bratunac, a Serb-held town some 15km away.
A UN spokesman in Sarajevo said it was planned to send in a medical team to
evacuate 35 to 40 seriously wounded women and children along with a convoy
carrying food and medicine. 'We are 99 per cent certain this convoy will get
in,' the spokesman said. Gen Morillon told French radio: 'I hope that
tomorrow morning we'll have a road convoy coming here that will in turn
evacuate women and children.' Srebrenica has been under siege for 11 months
and its population of about 60,000 has not received any aid by road since
December, although some supplies have been dropped into the area in recent
days by US aircraft.
In another interview, the general told French television that he may leave
Srebrenica today. The general has promised to stay in the town until relief
supplies were allowed through. At the same time, the UN commander said he
had informed his superiors before embarking on his controversial trip and
denied he had exceeded his mission.
He said that in his talks with the Serbs yesterday he had discussed his
demands for an immediate Serb ceasefire and a halt to the fighting. The Serb
commander, Gen Mladic, had demanded a statement from the Bosnian presidency
cancelling a planned counter-offensive on Srebrenica.
Bosnia's deputy president, Mr Ejup Ganic, said after speaking by telephone
to Gen Morillon that the UN commander indicated the Serbs expressed their
willingness to have a ceasefire in the Srebrenica region and his government
had agreed.
Bosnian radio said that several thousand more refugees arrived in Srebrenica
yesterday as the Serbs continued their offensive. Mr Laurens Jolles, an
official of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees who left Srebrenica on
Sunday, said up to 40 people were dying of cold and hunger daily.
'I have seen scenes I would never have expected in the 20th century,' Mr
Jolles said. 'Thousands of women and children living together in the snow,
without any shelter, huddled around fires. Most have not eaten for four to
five days.'

FT  16 MAR 93 / Banks fail to face brave new world: Report says European
banking is ill-prepared for Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST European Community banks are dangerously unprepared for the business
and technical changes required to adapt to monetary union.
They have only a vague idea of when and how union will come about and only
rough estimates of the time and cost of the changes - running as high as
FFr1.5bn (Pounds 180m) per bank over at least two years, and possibly as
many as five.
There will be upheaval on the European currency markets immediately prior to
the fixing of exchange rates. That will be followed by intense international
competition, which will see weaker banks going out of business as corporate
and private customers take advantage of the single currency to seek the
keenest prices and best services across frontiers.
Trading between European currencies will then tail off, to be succeeded by
more active, and hence riskier, trading between the European currency, the
dollar and the yen.
That is the alarming picture in a study published today by the Paris office
of KPMG Peat Marwick Consultants after interviews with more than 50 leading
European Community banks - one of the most detailed assessments yet of the
practical impact of monetary union.
'There is real danger of the banking industry being harmed if the
uncertainty. . . continues,' warns the report, which calls on governments to
agree a firm date for monetary union and decide how it is to come about.
Most EC banks reckon that full monetary union will happen, but not until
1999 or later, in any case well after the Maastricht treaty timetable. They
assume it will start with an inner core of countries, based on Germany,
France and the Benelux trio and that national currencies will run in
parallel with the single European currency for a while. This twin system
will be more costly to banks, retailers and businesses than a straight
switch. But bankers think politicians will want a twin-track transition with
two currencies to reassure the public.
Broadly, monetary union will sharply accelerate the greater integration of
European banking and the cross-border alliances between banks already under
way.
In detail, banks' currency departments will be the hardest hit. Their
revenues will fall sharply with the expected decline in trading between
European currencies.
Banks, including continental ones, expect a trend towards centralised
currency trading in London in the aftermath of union. That is irrespective
of whether or not Britain rejoins the EMS and is because of lower UK taxes
and the relative ease with which underperforming traders can be fired,
thanks to Britain's opt-out of the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, says
the survey.
Retail banking will be the next hardest hit by increased competition, with a
fall in profits as market inefficiencies are exposed. Banks are expecting to
concentrate on selling existing products, especially plastic cards, to new
foreign clients, rather than developing new products in this high-risk
environment. Retail banks will lose income from the declining need for
travellers' cheques and exchange services. They know heavy investment in
cross-border payments for small transactions will be needed, but believe
this will cut operating costs in the medium to long term, says the study.
Competition will also intensify in corporate banking, where the ease with
which customers will be able to compare pricing across Europe will make it
harder for individual banks to persuade business customers that they offer
special value.
As in retail banking, customers will demand better international payment
systems. One practical hurdle here is how to reconcile the high-speed
payments systems practised in continental Europe, where data only is
exchanged between banks, with the UK system where banks physically exchange
payment instruments. Bankers say they want a single European payment
mechanism for large commercial transactions, in contrast to the several that
today exist alongside Swift, the dominant Belgian-based payment system.
Investment banking will be less affected, since services such as mergers,
buy-outs and project finance are more linked to general European integration
than to the detail of monetary union. However, a successful and solid single
European currency could help attract more cash to European equities.
Monetary union will boost moves towards a single European equity trading
system by making it easier for buyers and sellers to compare share prices in
different community stock markets, says the study.
European banks have not experienced an upheaval like this in recent memory,
and are finding it hard to identify exactly where the main costs will arise.
The biggest cost will probably be changing computer systems for handling
payments, customer information, automatic cash machines and - for retailers
 -redesigning point of sale terminals. Banks also expect to spend more on
training.
Beyond that, the nearest parallel is the upheaval British banks experienced
with the introduction of decimal coinage in 1971. Barclays alone purchased
Pounds 10.5m of bronze coins, weighing 3,500 tonnes and shifted them to
1,000 storage centres before distribution to branches on the change-over
day. That exercise took two years.
More recently UK banks took six months to phase in a new Pounds 10 note.
European monetary union will be on an awesomely different scale.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Spate of accidents at Hoechst leads to safety concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE person died and another suffered third degree burns yesterday after an
explosion and fire at Hoechst's main plant near Frankfurt.
This is the sixth accident that Hoechst has suffered in less than a month -
the first involving the loss of life - and it immediately prompted calls
from regional and national politicians for tougher safety controls on the
entire German chemicals sector.
The explosion took place at 7.44 am when two men were preparing a section of
plant used in manufacturing polyvinylalcohol, or Mowiol, for repair works.
Hoechst said the cause of the accident was as yet unknown.
The accident comes less than a month after Hoechst accidentally released 10
tonnes of chemicals - some potentially toxic - from its Griesheim plant. The
chemicals descended on the Frankfurt suburb of Schwanheim.
Although no-one was hurt, dozens of residents visited doctors after the leak
and there was an expensive and high-profile clean-up campaign.
Since the incident in late February, the company has been plagued with a
series of accidents. Only last Friday, Hoechst inadvertently discharged 100
litres of a poisonous solution into the Rhine from a plant in Wiesbaden.
Hoechst said yesterday it regretted the loss of life in the latest accident
and would co-operate with investigations launched yesterday by the local
police and legal officials from the state of Hesse.
Mrs Ursula Tober, a Hoechst press officer, said that the company was
saddened and bewildered by the series of accidents. 'We simply cannot
explain it to ourselves why all this has happened all at once.'
Mr Klaus Topfer, Germany's federal minister for the environment, yesterday
vowed to intensify pressure on the chemicals industry to improve safety
standards. Hoechst had already begun an examination of its safety and other
procedures in the wake of the first accident last month.

THE European Commission is considering fresh measures to stimulate growth

'jumbo' meeting of finance ministers from the Twelve and the six members of
the European Free Trade Area on April 19 in Luxembourg.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Bundesbank backs deal on solidarity pact

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING figures in Germany's banking community and members of the Bundesbank
council yesterday welcomed the cross-party agreement on finance for a
solidarity pact for east Germany, in spite of concern about a rise in public
sector borrowing.
Mr Reimut Jochimsen, president of the state central bank in North
Rhine-Westphalia, and a leading Bundesbank council member, described the
deal as a great success. He greeted it with 'great relief', while stressing
that many of the figures had yet to be agreed in detail.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, believed the central
bank would not be entirely satisfied, but would continue to relax its
monetary policy.
The deal is expected to provide a substantial increase in funds for
investment in east German industry, and double the money available for a
housing modernisation programme from DM30bn (Pounds 12.7bn) to DM60bn.
Interest payments on the credit will be directly subsidised by the federal
budget in Bonn, and the central government will also assume responsibility
for servicing DM31bn in outstanding debts on the east German housing stock.
The costs are all likely to add to the government's net borrowing
requirement in the next three years. A further rise in borrowing in the
current year is almost inevitable, because of an agreement to provide an
extra DM2bn for job creation schemes, pushing up the 1993 borrowing
requirement of the central government from DM51bn to DM53bn.
However, the Finance Ministry in Bonn said yesterday that no figure had been
put on the increase in the borrowing limit of the Treuhand privatisation
agency, reported at the weekend also to be raised by DM30bn.
A spokesman for the ministry said it was intended to keep the borrowing
increase of the Treuhand within an agreed 'buffer' of DM8bn per year for
1993 and 1994, on top of the DM30bn per year it is currently allowed to
borrow. The extra money is intended both for restructuring 'core industries'
which cannot immediately be sold, and for cleaning up the ecological damage
caused by the old industries.
Overall, the solidarity pact will provide the five eastern states with
DM55.8bn from 1995 to finance their running costs, DM51bn at the expense of
the central government, and DM4.9bn from the western states.
The Bundesbank council meets on Thursday amid continuing market speculation
about the likelihood of further interest rate cuts.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday issued a ringing endorsement of
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, warning that not only his domestic reform
policy but the entire process of peaceful international co-operation was
threatened by the political backlash in Moscow.
In a statement on political developments in Russia, Mr Kohl declared that
the reforms pursued by Mr Yeltsin and his government were in the interests
not only of Russia and its people, but also of all other countries, above
all Germany. 'I therefore emphatically endorse this process,' he said.
President Francois Mitterrand of France will be carrying a similar message
of support for Mr Yeltsin when he arrives in Moscow today. The visit will be
'a chance for the French president to reaffirm how strongly France wants
Russia to recover its balance', an Elysee spokesman said.
In his statement, Mr Kohl said: 'President Yeltsin and the political groups
which support him, striving for democracy and the rule of law, a market
economy and not least, a policy of peaceful co-operation with the world
community, are increasingly threatened by forces which want to stop the
reform process in Russia.'
Although Germany had reached the limits of its financial capacity to support
Russia, the debate within the G7 over further ways of providing economic
assistance 'underlines the importance the western countries attach to the
continuation of the reform process,' he said.
The German government also attached vital importance to its bilateral
relations with Russia, he added, in a statement which could be clearly seen
as a direct warning to Mr Yeltsin's opponents in the Russian Congress of
Deputies.
'Russia and Germany today enjoy relations which are free of tension,
trusting and friendly. This is due in good measure to the achievements of
Boris Yeltsin. We want these relations to be developed in mutual interest
and trust, so that a free, democratic Russia, based on a market economy,
remains a peaceful, calculable and stable partner both for Germany and for
all our neighbouring states.'
Meanwhile, Japan seems set for a clash with the US, France and Germany over
its opposition to an emergency summit to sanction further aid to Russia. The
Japanese government is opposed to a summit meeting to consider the issue
even though a meeting of G7 officials in Hong Kong over the weekend agreed
to consider plans for further aid.
Japan insists it cannot consider further aid until Russia accepts Japan's
claim to sovereignty over the four islands off the northern tip of Japan
known as the northern territories.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday reserved the right to make
the final decision on whether to introduce the controversial energy tax
proposed by Brussels to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions.
Their proprietorial move came as the current Danish presidency of the EC
confirmed it was calling a special meeting of environment and energy
ministers on April 23 to try to break the logjam on the tax and the EC's
overall emissions strategy.
There are still serious reservations among the Twelve about how the tax  -
which would rise to the equivalent of Dollars 10 a barrel of oil by 2000 -
would work. But introducing it at all has been made conditional on the EC's
main trading partners following suit.
The finance ministers yesterday said they were encouraged by the recent US
proposal to introduce a fuel tax, but emphasised it was still not clear what
was planned by the EC's other main competitors, such as Japan.
Denmark is nevertheless still hoping a decision can be reached at June's
meeting of finance ministers.

IT IS now clear that Mr Boris Yeltsin means to fight for supremacy. The

possible with his hardline opponents in the Congress of People's Deputies,
and that he will strive, within constitutional limits, to beat them.
As Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former premier and now a key presidential aide, said
yesterday: 'The result of the Congress was to show that the policy of
compromise has more or less reached its limit.'
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister who was singled out for
personal attack in the Congress session that ended on Saturday, agreed.
Speaking in London yesterday during an official visit, he said the Congress
had 'destroyed the balance of power' in Russia, and that the president's
response would be 'strong and active, within the framework of existing
laws'.
The tactic now being considered by the president is to proceed to a
plebiscite which, his advisers believe, he can do within the law on
referendums. They say this law allows a poll of the population through the
initiative of the citizens themselves, through the collection of 1m
signatures. This plebiscite, likely to ask whether the people wish to see
the president or the parliament in control of policy and perhaps also if
they wish to see private ownership of land, may be supervised by
international observers to ensure fair play.
At the same time, according to Mr Gaidar, the president may wish to secure
support from the centre by appointing to the cabinet figures from the centre
of politics - in particular from the Civic Union bloc, which includes the
Russian Union of Industrialists, Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi's Free
Russia party and other forces.
That support from this quarter is still possible for Mr Yeltsin was
underscored by Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, the young deputy who is secretary of the
constitutional commission of parliament and leader of the Social Democratic
Centre party. Noting that 'one main feature of the last Congress was that
the centre did not make their views known', he said that 'the solution to
the deepening political crisis can only be found with the involvement of the
centre forces'.
In contrast to the veiled threats by Mr Yeltsin to take special measures to
enforce his rule, most aides are anxious to avoid an authoritarian solution.
Mr Chubais said: 'A lot of deputies thought last week that they would be
arrested in the Kremlin. That is not the president's decision; he will take
the legal course.'
The parliamentary leadership, for its part, is certain that a referendum
cannot be undertaken constitutionally. Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the first deputy
chairman of parliament who in a speech on the second day of Congress last
week unequivocally demoted Mr Yeltsin to second place after the parliament,
said flatly at the weekend that 'any move to a referendum which involves
spending state funds must be regulated by law and needs to get parliamentary
consent'.
However, the constitutionality of the parliament's behaviour will now be
challenged in the Constitutional Court. A group of 57 deputies from the
pro-presidential Democratic Russia bloc yesterday published a statement
disputing whether the decisions taken last week, and at the Seventh Congress
in December, were constitutional.
The terrain of the struggle is the constitution but the prize is raw power,
and the right to conduct reform. Mr Chubais said a positive result in the
proposed referendum would be the start of a process leading to new elections
and the adoption of a new constitution. On the other hand, he warned, if Mr
Yeltsin's parliamentary opponents retain the upper hand, 'at the next
Congress (scheduled for June), we will lose the presidency or the president
himself'.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Rise in output lifts recovery hopes: Lawson calls for Pounds
6bn tax increase to curb fiscal deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP RISE in manufacturing production has provided a favourable
background for today's Budget by adding to expectations about a UK recovery.
Manufacturing production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent in January
compared with the previous month, well above expectations in the City.
News that manufacturing output was the highest since August 1991 coincided
with growing speculation that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will seize
the opportunity in his Budget speech to raise taxes from 1993-94 to curb the
growing fiscal deficit.
Pressure on Mr Lamont to take bold action on this front increased last night
after Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor, said failure to raise taxes
by Pounds 6bn would be a 'serious mistake', as he became the latest in a
series of former Tory cabinet ministers to urge tax rises.
At a conference on currency markets in London, Lord Lawson said a tax rise
of this magnitude 'could prove a political and economic turning point that
is so badly needed'.
Also, in a surprising departure from his previous enthusiasm for the
European exchange rate mechanism, Lord Lawson said it was 'only a matter of
time' before the ERM broke down after the pressures of German unification
and the drive towards a single currency robbed the system of its
flexibility.
Further indications that the economy may be turning came yesterday with a
survey by Trade Indemnity, credit insurers, showing that exporters have
increased their order books in the past three months, taking advantage of
the 15 per cent devaluation in sterling since the UK left the ERM in
September.
The Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents, an industry-appointed body,
provided further evidence of a revival in the housing market by reporting a
strong rise in sales last month.
In recent weeks, Mr Lamont has been advised by many in the City and by his
own backbenchers that he should head off the possibility of Britain moving
towards Italian-style budget deficits through a tough tax increase.
According to this argument, the more favourable auguries about the economy
mean that the risk of stifling an upturn by a fiscal tightening has been
greatly reduced.
With many City economists expecting the gap between government spending and
income to reach some Pounds 50bn in the financial year starting next month,
the word from Whitehall yesterday was that Mr Lamont is planning to make his
Budget speech about half an hour longer than the normal 60 minutes or so in
order to deal adequately with an explanation of fiscal policy.
Yesterday's release of the manufacturing figures was accompanied by a
warning from the Central Statistical Office that the monthly data may have
been distorted by the timing of the Christmas holidays. Even so, in the
three months to the end of January, manufacturing output rose by 0.7 per
cent against the same period a year earlier.
All production industries - including energy, water and manufacturing -
showed a 0.4 per cent drop in output between December last year and January.
Output of oil and gas fell 6 per cent between the two months, largely
because of operating diffiintends culties in the North Sea.

FT  16 MAR 93 / BA wins temporary approval for USAir link-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, NIKKI TAIT and DANNY GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US gave temporary approval yesterday to British Airways' plans for a
partnership with USAir but demanded that London and Washington renegotiate
their aviation treaty to allow US airlines greater access to British
airports.
Mr Federico Pena, US transportation secretary, agreed to BA's request for
'code-sharing' with USAir, which the two carriers hope will create a
'seamless service' by listing USAir's US flights and BA's transatlantic
flights under the same codes in computer bookings systems.
He also approved plans for USAir to lease aircraft and crews to BA for
London-Baltimore and London-Pittsburgh flights, but not for
London-Charlotte.
Mr Pena said BA's initial Dollars 300m (Pounds 210m) investment in USAir did
not breach US laws restricting foreign ownership of US airlines to 25 per
cent, but that the second and third phases of the proposed deal, under which
BA would invest a further Dollars 450m, could not be completed unless the US
Congress changed the law on foreign ownership.
This, he hoped, would provide the incentive for the UK to renegotiate the
Bermuda 2 treaty: 'If Congress doesn't act, British Airways will have
invested Dollars 300m and cannot proceed further. That is the hook.' He said
he would review the deal in a year.
The 'big three' US carriers - American, United and Delta - which lobbied
against the code-sharing arrangement, reacted to the announcement with
'disappointment and puzzlement'.
'There's not a bit of it which makes any policy sense,' said one adviser.
BA welcomed Mr Pena's statement, saying it would begin the code-sharing
arrangement to three US cities - Cleveland, Syracuse and Rochester - on May
1, as previously announced.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said he was delighted that passengers
would be able to fly more easily between airports on the two airlines'
networks.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said he broadly welcomed the
arrangement and hoped it would attract more passengers to BA from airports
it does not serve directly. He added, echoing Mr Pena's comments on
bilateral co-operation, that he remained committed 'to achieving greater
liberalisation between our two countries across the Atlantic.'
Mr Pena said that, although he did not like the terms of the Bermuda 2
treaty between the UK and the US, the US could not disregard it while
insisting that Australia and Japan abide by the provisions of their
bilateral aviation treaties with Washington.

FT  16 MAR 93 / Chinese premier accuses Patten of breaking pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON, TONY WALKER and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, BEIJING, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Li Peng, the Chinese premier, yesterday accused Mr Chris Patten, Hong
Kong's governor, and the British government of 'perfidiously' dishonouring
agreements on the colony's transition to Chinese rule in 1997.
Mr Li, addressing the opening session of China's parliament, departed from
his prepared text and made one of the sternest attacks yet by a Chinese
leader since relations deteriorated last year after Mr Patten disclosed
plans to extend Hong Kong's democratic reforms.
The speech followed the publication on Friday of Mr Patten's legislation to
enact such reforms. Beijing's reaction hampers any early resumption of talks
on the colony's future, and adds to pressures on Mr Patten from an
increasingly nervous local business community.
The Chinese premier's address sent Hong Kong share prices sharply lower. The
Hang Seng index fell 315.79, or 5.1 per cent, to close at 5,854.61, leaving
it a full 10 per cent below its peak, reached a week ago.
Senior business leaders called for calm. Sir William Purves, chairman of
HSBC Holdings, the owner of Hongkong Bank and of Midland Bank of the UK,
said he remained optimistic about Hong Kong's future in spite of the
political problems between the colony and China.
He warned, however, that domestic business confidence could be affected and
that foreign investors might be 'frightened off' if the row dragged on. 'I
very much hope that they (Britain and China) can sit down and devise a way
forward for the 1995 elections,' he said.
Britain stressed that it remained willing to hold 'unconditional' talks with
Beijing on its plans for political reform in Hong Kong.
But in an otherwise conciliatory statement in the House of Commons, Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, insisted that London would not accept the
downgrading of Hong Kong's role in any negotiations. Speaking with the
overwhelming support of MPs from all the main parties, Mr Hurd stressed
there was still time for talks with Beijing to modify Mr Patten's plans.
But the foreign secretary flatly rejected a charge by Mr Li that Mr Patten's
proposals were in contravention of the Basic Law governing Hong Kong's
future. Referring to Beijing's demand that the status of Hong Kong officials
in any talks be downgraded, he said: 'The implication of that was not one we
could accept'.
Mr Li told some 3,000 delegates at the National People's Congress that Mr
Patten's democratic reform proposals ran completely counter to Britain's
'commitment' to bring Hong Kong's system into line with the
Chinese-controlled 'Special Administrative Region' after 1997.
'The British government,' he added, 'shall be held exclusively responsible
for all serious consequences arising from its latest action.'
Mr Li described as a 'sacred right' China's resumption of sovereignty over
Hong Kong in 1997 which 'shall not be interfered with and sabotaged in any
way.' But he also observed: 'We hope for co-operation, not confrontation.'
Hong Kong politicians, stockbrokers and political analysts, noted that he
had not ruled out talks.
Mrs Selina Chow, a senior member of Hong Kong's conservative political
grouping known as the Co-operative Resources Centre, said: 'It seems that
there is room for further discussion.'
But it emerged yesterday that a planned meeting of the Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group for this month was unlikely to proceed. A Foreign Office
official said the two sides had not discussed an agenda for the meeting.

FT  16 MAR 93 / BBC governors to hold private talks over Birt affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY, DAVID OWEN and GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNORS of the BBC are expected to meet privately tonight to try to find a
solution to the row over Mr John Birt and his tax affairs before their
formal meeting on Thursday.
The private dinner in London will be the first time the governors have met
collectively since the revelation that Mr Birt was for six years a freelance
consultant rather than a BBC staff member - in spite of being deputy
director-general - and was paid via his private company, John Birt
Productions.
The dinner echoes a meeting two years ago when Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC
chairman, pushed through the controversial decision not to advertise the
post of director-general but to nominate Mr Birt as director-general
designate.
Mr Stuart Bell, the Labour frontbench spokesman on the City, yesterday
called for Mr Birt and Mr Hussey to resign.
He said the taxpayer was entitled to 'better standards' from the BBC and
Inland Revenue and pledged to raise the matter in the house. 'Why did the
Inland Revenue accept such schemes when it was clear that the person who was
self-employed had only one employer?'
However, support for Mr Birt came yesterday from the BBC board of management
and a group of senior correspondents. BBC vice-chairman Lord Barnett last
night described criticisms of Mr Birt as a 'grotesque slur on a very fine
man'. The director-general, he said, had been given unanimous support from
the board of management which had a letter to that effect published in
yesterday's Times.
Six senior BBC journalists, led by Mr Peter Jay, the economics editor, sent
a similar letter of support to the Times.
The position of Mr Hussey seems less secure, with some governors extremely
angry that they were not told about Mr Birt's employment status.
Mr Hussey yesterday returned to Broadcasting House, the BBC's headquarters,
after a visit to Australia and Hong Kong, apparently determined to tough out
one of the most controversial episodes in the corporation's recent history.
Mr Hussey is understood to be prepared to take the resignations of other
governors, if necessary, rather than resign himself. Five of the board of
governors retire between now and July, including three of the most
influential: Mr Keith Oates, the managing director of Marks and Spencer; Mr
Bill Jordan, the trade union leader; and PD James, the novelist.
Mr Oates has revealed that he knew a month ago how Mr Birt was paid during
negotiations on his new contract as director-general, and has expressed
opposition to such an arrangement.
Tomorrow provides a further opportunity for the governors to assess the
situation when they meet the General Advisory Council of the BBC, the
41-member nationwide group whose views are sought on a variety of BBC
issues.

FT  15 MAR 93 / People: Ritchie switches off from Tyne Tees TV
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Ritchie is this week leaving his post as Tyne Tees Television's managing
director, following his decision not to stand for re-election as a board
member of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Group at Friday's agm in Leeds.
Ritchie will be succeeded as Tyne Tees managing director by John Calvert,
currently the group director of personnel. No announcement has yet been made
on who is to fill Ritchie's other role of group deputy chief executive.
Although Ritchie's departure has been officially described as amicable,
insiders say it reflects tension within the group over the extent to which
Tyne Tees TV, headquartered in Newcastle, could maintain its autonomy
following last year's merger with its larger Leeds-based neighbour,
Yorkshire Television.
A week before Friday's AGM, an executive board meeting of the group
discussed plans for a radical restructuring, under which Tyne Tees would
have played a much more subsidiary role within the merged company. 'That was
the final battle at which Ian lost the war,' said one insider.
He said he understood the Independent Television Commission's support had
been sought for the restructuring, but it had said it could only comment
once plans had been implemented.
Yesterday, however, Yorkshire Television firmly denied that it was running
down the Tyne Tees operations and dismissed suggestions that Mr Ritchie had
left after disagreements with Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees managing
director.
'Tyne Tees will continue to have a strong production base,' the company
said, adding that nothing would be done 'that would affect the licence
commitment of the company, or the commitments given at the time of the
merger'.
Yorkshire and Tyne Tees were among the highest bidders for franchises in
1991, paying Pounds 37.7m and Pounds 15m respectively - a combined weekly
payment of more than Pounds 1m. Last November the group announced 292 job
losses, at that time nearly a quarter of the combined workforce.
Calvert joined Yorkshire Television as director of personnel in August 1988;
previously he was director of industrial relations for the ITV network,
based in London. He became a director of Yorkshire Television Holdings in
1989.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Arts: Parisian cathedral of culture - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I do not often sit down to a candlelit dinner in a French cathedral but last
week I had the opportunity, between mouthfuls of lamb and couscous, to study
the Romanesque sculptures of the cathedral of St Lazare at Autun. At the
same time I was able to contemplate the outstanding 12th-century carvings of
the tympanum of the Vision of the Apocalypse at the abbey church of Moissac;
and I scarcely had to turn my head to see the remarkable relationship
between architecture and sculpture at the basilica of St Madeleine at
Vezelay. Within reach of my table were the slender sculptures from Chartres
as well as columns, capitals, chancels and Carolingian conceits from all
over France.
I was, of course, in a cathedral of culture, at an elegant Parisian event to
mark the re-opening of the Musee National des Monuments Francais at the
Palais de Chaillot. The story of this museum goes back to the 1880s when the
architect Eugene-Emanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879) had the idea that the
French public should have the chance to see, in Paris, the high points of
French architecture and sculpture of the Middle Ages. He put together this
remarkable assembly of cast copies of important elements of buildings in
what was then the new Palais du Trocadero, which had originally been
designed by the architect Davioud for the Paris Universal Exhibition in
1878.
The display was always intended to be didactic, offering the visitor the
opportunity to make comparative analyses of stylistic developments.
Viollet-le-Duc was a scholar and historian and his architectural activity
consisted principally of repair and restoration, including work on monuments
including Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. He wrote a dictionary
of French architecture and this museum is an effective monument to his
conviction that architects can and should learn from the past. He saw the
parallels between Gothic structures and the development of 19th-century
engineering.
As the original progenitor of the museum, Viollet-le-Duc would have approved
of the way it has suddenly taken on a new lease of life. The original
Trocadero was transformed in 1937 by the architect Carlu into the Palais de
Chaillot, as the centrepiece of the Paris Universal Exposition of that year.
Today these former exhibition buildings gather around the steps and stylish
fountains of the Trocadero, paying homage to the Eiffel Tower. They remain
resolutely of the 1930s and provide an extraordinary contrast to the
architectural collections housed there.
For a long time the casts have been seen as little more than dusty relics,
stranded in the 1930s splendour of the Chaillot. It has taken the dramatic
energy of Mr Jack Lang and his ministry of education and culture to see the
potential of this important museum. It has also taken an enormous amount of
work and inspiration from the young curator  - Mr Guy Cogeval, who came here
from the Louvre; in only six months he has achieved a considerable
transformation.
It begins in the new entrance hall which has been designed by a young
architect, Jean-Christophe Denise. This is a handsome light space in the
spirit of Carlu. It has a most stylish cafe-restaurant with a marvellous
view of the fountains of the Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower (the furniture
is based on Carlu's original art deco designs); there is also a new
bookshop. The clean lines of this hall provide a cool setting for the four
giant fragments of the reproduction of the sculpture - 'la danse de
Carpeaux' - originally created by Paul Landowski in 1931. These look
dramatic and surreal, mounted at a high level on large plinths.
The hall is accessible to all visitors to the museums in the Palais de
Chaillot, including those of the theatre and cinema. (The Musee du Cinema is
likely to enjoy a close relationship with the renovated Musee national des
Monuments Francais because of Mr Cogeval's great interest in film and his
plans to create events that explore both the plastic and the cinematic
arts.)
To visit the great halls upstairs that house the maquettes, casts and models
is a thrilling experience, although in time the displays will probably be
reordered and captioned to make them both more instructive and more
enjoyable. Mr Cogeval is anxious to make more of the amazing collections of
topographical and architectural photographs stored here. They will form part
of the large programme of temporary exhibitions.
The first exhibition to be held is called 'Marseille a Paris', a version of
the very successful exhibition held in Marseilles. Its subject is the city
in the 19th century, considering both the physical character of the changing
city and the artistic activity within it at the time. A large variety of
artefacts ranging from contemporary models and maps to paintings and plans,
drawings and sculptures is displayed to convey the commerce and creativity
of one entire city at a peak moment of its growth. (The installation here is
sometimes inevitably in conflict with the permanent installation of the
museum, but in 1994 there will be a full-scale temporary exhibition space.)
Marseilles grew and prospered in the 19th century, its artistic flowering as
aesthetically mixed as any other city at the time. It is probably right to
show the whole range so that comparisons of quality can be made. Relatively
unknown history painters are shown as seriously as old masters, and posters
and plans rub shoulders with fine drawings. It is a complex and dense
exhibition, giving a sense of a city touched by the exoticism of its African
trade and yet solidly rooted in the Second Empire in its architecture and
monuments.
The renewal of this museum in Paris is important for the broadening of our
architectural culture. It will take a lot of imagination to build on the
solid foundations of the unique collection. The resurrection has just begun,
but I am sure Mr Cogeval will ensure that it continues with both scholarship
and excitement. It is a museum to watch.

FT  15 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Biscuits' full-year results on Thursday will be heavily scarred by
the profits collapse at Keebler, its US subsidiary, and a consequent
restructuring charge. With margins still under pressure, analysts forecast
group pre-tax profits of about Pounds 160m, down from Pounds 211.3m last
time.
The McVitie's division is thought to have benefited from a stronger
year-end, as well as from contributions from European acquisitions. A small
improvement is forecast for the Ross Young's frozen foods business, though
KP Foods' results fell back slightly.
Annual profits from English China Clays, due today, will reflect the
problems of the paper industry, its major customer. Paper makers have been
trying to share their pain with suppliers while ECC is also suffering
competition from the US. Analysts are looking for a fall in profits from
1991's Pounds 115.4m pre-tax to Pounds 85m-Pounds 95m. However, under FRS 3
the numbers should look better, with a rise to around Pounds 100m from
Pounds 79.3m.
The end of the UK-quoted banks reporting round comes today with results from
HSBC Holdings. HSBC, which acquired Midland Bank last summer, is expected to
announce pre-tax profits of between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.8bn for 1992.
Guinness, on Thursday, is expected to report a 17 per cent decline in 1992
pre-tax profits to Pounds 795m, with an exceptional charge of Pounds 125m
for the reorganisation of the group's Scotch whisky operations and Spanish
brewing business accounting for most of the shortfall on 1991's Pounds 956m.
Spirits' trading profits will reflect the impact of difficult conditions in
the UK, Japan, and some European markets. A 1.5 per cent rise to Pounds 760m
is expected. Brewing profits are forecast to rise from Pounds 244m to Pounds
265m. The contribution from LVMH, the French cognac and champagne group, is
likely to be about Pounds 23m lower at Pounds 100m.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the papermaker, is likely to report on Thursday a
drop in pre-tax profits of around one-third to Pounds 160m. It is suffering
from the slowdown in the continental economies and excess capacity.
Laporte, the UK chemicals group, reports its full-year results today. During
the takeover of Evode earlier this year, the company predicted that its
pre-tax profits would fall from Pounds 97.2m to Pounds 86m. Analysts expect
the full-year dividend to rise from 18.9p a share to between 19.3p and 19.7p
per share. Analysts will be more interested in the group's forecasts for the
remainder of the year. More than a third of Laporte's sales are in north
America.
Rentokil, the pest control, plant hire and environmental services group, is
expected to report on Thursday another big jump in pre-tax profits for 1992.
Analysts are expecting profits of about Pounds 115m-Pounds 122m (Pounds
94.6m). A full-year dividend of 2p-2.5p (1.7p) is forecast.
Pre-tax profits at IMI, the Birmingham engineer reporting today, were
running 9 per cent down on 1991 at the halfway stage. That trend looks
likely to have continued for the full year as the problems of the UK economy
and the particular problems of the titanium market outweigh the strength of
the building products business in Germany and the drinks dispense division.
A likely outcome is taxable profits of about Pounds 64m for 1992 with a
maintained final dividend of 5.8p.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Boost for Lib-Lab pact advocates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVOCATES of an electoral pact between Labour and the Liberal Democrats
received a boost yesterday when an opinion poll revealed that together the
opposition parties would sweep the country, Ivo Dawnay writes.
The Gallup findings, taken from a sample of 1,034 voters in the first week
of February, showed 58 per cent would support a new Lib-Lab pact while just
26 per cent would vote Conservative.
The result is certain to be brushed aside by the Labour leadership, which
dismissed a call from the party's candidate in Newbury, Berkshire, at the
last general election to allow the Liberal Democrats a free run in the
coming by-election. Mr John Smith, the party leader, has always argued that
Labour must win elections outright.
Furthermore, Labour's relations with the Liberal Democrats have been more
than usually strained recently because of Mr Paddy Ashdown's decision in
November to back the government in the so-called Maastricht paving debate -
won by the Conservatives by just four votes.
Mr Alan Clark, the former defence minister, has confirmed that Newbury
Conservatives have rejected him as their candidate for the by-election. He
has not been included on the shortlist of 18.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Bombay Stock Exchange plans to resume trading today
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bombay Stock Exchange is planning to resume trading today and re-open
sooner than expected in a bid to restore business confidence in India's
commercial capital, writes Stefan Wagstyl.
Trading will be carried out in a makeshift trading room set up over the
weekend to replace a large new trading centre which has been destroyed.
Trading will be limited to an hour.
Exchange officials were persuaded to try to re-start today after meetings
with Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and Mr Sharad Pawar, the
chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes Bombay.
Bombay police found and defused a bomb hidden in a scooter parked near a
busy railway station in the city centre. The police said the scooter had not
been moved since Friday and had probably been placed by Friday's bombers.
Mr A S Samra, the city's police commissioner, said last night that police
had questioned several people in connection with the bombings, but none was
suspected of being involved, and no one had been detained.

private cellular arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Telekom, the German telecommunications state monopoly, will create
a private subsidiary to operate its cellular telephone networks and fight
mounting competition in the domestic market, Mr Helmut Ricke, the chief
executive announced.
The subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom Mobilfunk, will have a basic capital of
between DM300m and DM1bn and will start operating in January 1 1994. Sales
for the first year are expected to be DM3.5bn (Dollars 2.1bn) and to grow to
DM8bn by 2000.
The move could pave the way for the group to privatise other divisions,
except its traditional telephone services which, according to the national
constitution, must be under state administra-tion.
The company has been urging the government to push ahead with full
privatisation. Talks on the issue reopened last week in Bonn between the
ruling coalition parties and the opposition Social Democrats, whose approval
is needed to change the constitution.
The subsidiary will operate the existing C and D1 cellular telephone
networks, which compete with the D2 network operated by Mannesman, the
German engineering group.
Other competitors include a consortium headed by Thyssen and Veba, the
German industrial groups, Bellsouth of the US and Vodafone of Britain which
was recently awarded a licence to develop and operate a new network, with 3m
subscribers expected by the end of the decade.
Deutsche Telekom also announced it will join forces with Preussag, the
German steel and engineering group, and Alcatel Sel, to form a company which
will recycle electronic goods.
The company also announced the creation of a venture with a consortium of
Ukrainian companies to develop telecoms in the former Soviet republic.

FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Company News: 11% stakeholder decides to reject Airtours'
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILLIPS AND Drew Fund Management, a 10.8 per cent shareholder in holiday
company Owners Abroad, is understood to have decided not to accept the
Pounds 294m hostile bid from rival Airtours.
The decision follows the news last Friday that Mercury Asset Management
would cast its 15 per cent shareholding behind Airtours
PDFM's decision will revive confidence in the Owners camp ahead of the close
of the bid tomorrow. Its loyalty could turn out to be the deciding factor
that narrowly allows Owners to retain its independence.
Both holiday companies will be anxious to see whether Thomas Cook, the
travel agency, enters the market to buy Owners shares this morning.
The German-controlled group and its sister, LTU, the German tour company,
have proposed a commercial tie-up with Owners and last week made a
conditional offer for 12.5 per cent of Owners' shares at 150p if the
Airtours' bid fails. At Friday's close Airtours' paper offer was worth
149.3p.
Meanwhile, Airtours is today likely to switch the focus of its attack. The
company will argue that shareholders should examine the likely shape of the
Owners' share register and the number of large shareholdings that would
overhang the market should the bid fail.
MAM and Airtours, with seven per cent of Owners' shares at the moment, would
be likely sellers as would other shareholders who assented the offer,
Airtours will argue. Up to about 20 per cent of Owners would be held by
either directors or Thomas Cook.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said yesterday that this would
severely restrict liquidity and the Thomas Cook stake would effectively give
the Germans a blocking interest and control.
'The downside of an independent Owners Abroad is a frightening scenario,' he
said. 'The Germans are still trying to get control of a public company, and
a fairly substantial one, in England.' He added: 'Owners Abroad will end up
a satellite of the German company which will view it as bid proof.'
The Airtours' chairman said that the tie-up had been 'cooked up to spoil our
bid.'
Owners' advisers rejected the argument about the potential overhang. They
said Thomas Cook's tender would soak up some of the shares and that there
were buyers of Owners if its price fell. There could also be yield support
about 130p.
'People's understanding of Thomas Cook deals is much better now,' an adviser
said. 'Institutions and markets may re-rate Owners Abroad.'

FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sotheby's falls to Dollars 6.5mas auction
income dives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Sotheby's Holdings, the auction house which is controlled
by the Detroit-based Taubman family but still quoted in London and New York,
tumbled from Dollars 21.5m to Dollars 6.49m, or Pounds 4.57m sterling, in
1992.
The main cause of the fall was that pre-tax income from auctions declined to
Dollars 4.02m (Dollars 18.9m) on revenues up slightly at Dollars 200.9m
(Dollars 193.9m), though profits from financial services slipped to Dollars
5.21m (Dollars 7.81m) on revenues down at Dollars 14.5m (Dollars 20.6m).
However real estate profits grew to Dollars 2.09m (Dollars 312,000) on
revenues ahead at Dollars 9.63m (Dollars 7.83m).
The company said: 'Auction sales increased modestly' to Dollars 1.13bn
(Dollars 1.1bn). Operating income emerged at Dollars 1.1m (losses Dollars
3.82m), though this excluded income from Sotheby's principal activities
sharply down at Dollars 1.77m (Dollars 15.9m) and one-off restructuring
costs of Dollars 4.86m. This resulted in operating losses from the auction
activities of Dollars 1.99m (profits Dollars 12.1m).
Earnings per share dropped to 7 cents (25 cents).
The company said there had been improvements in certain areas and that the
Impressionist and Modern market had been more stable. Here the Dollars 10m
barrier was broken for the first time since 1990 when Henri Matisse's L'Asie
was sold for Dollars 11m. It added that in 1992 it had sold 70 works for
more than Dollars 1m, against 51 in 1991.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Salvador defence minister bows to US pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EL SALVADOR'S defence minister has offered to resign, after the US
threatened to withhold military aid unless he and other blacklisted officers
were removed in 15 days.
The offer by Mr Emilio Ponce, described by El Salvador's vice-president as a
'patriotic and positive gesture', came as the United Nations prepared to
publish today a long-awaited report on human rights atrocities in the 1980s.
The report is expected to name high-ranking military officers, politicians,
businessmen and some guerrillas as responsible for war crimes and human
rights abuses.
President Alfredo Cristiani, under pressure from the army and his right-wing
party, has struggled to block the publication of the report, arguing that
this would further inflame tensions and damage the process of national
reconciliation.
Mr Ponce was one of more than 100 military officers who had to be purged
under the UN peace accords signed last year, but Mr Cristiani refused to
sack him and 14 other senior officers. The pressure from the US to remove
offending officers is the first sign of its flexing its muscles in Central
America.
After announcing his offer, Mr Ponce published a Defence Ministry analysis
of the dangers facing El Salvador: 'Communism has not disappeared. In El
Salvador, its immediate objective is the destruction of the armed forces to
consummate its assault on power.'

FT  15 MAR 93 / Senior BBC staff rally behind Birt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH THE BBC board of management and a group of senior BBC journalists have
rallied publicly to the support of beleaguered director-general Mr John
Birt.
The moves follow the intervention of Sir Tim Bell, the public relations guru
who tried, unsuccessfully, to save Mr David Mellor from having to resign as
national heritage secretary last year.
The arguments now being used, and endorsed by senior journalists such as Mr
John Simpson, Mr Peter Jay, Ms Polly Toynbee and Mr Martyn Lewis in a letter
in today's Times newspaper, is that Mr Birt has to be supported to save his
programme of reform at the corporation.
Mr Birt, who joined the BBC staff only last week after revelations he had
been a freelance consultant with his own private company for the six years
he was deputy director-general, is committed to making the BBC more
efficient.
There was growing speculation last night that attempts to save Mr Birt may
be at the expense of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman. The Daily
Telegraph newspaper today quotes an influential BBC governor, Mr Keith
Oates, managing director of Marks and Spencers, saying he made clear a month
ago that he disapproved of Mr Birt's freelance status and tax arrangements.
It is noticeable that not a single governor has so far publicly endorsed the
position of either Mr Birt or Mr Hussey. The issue will be discussed at a
BBC board of governors meeting on Thursday.
Friends say that Mr Birt has been deeply shocked by the events of the past
week but that with the support of Sir Tim, who has been a public relations
adviser to the BBC for some years, he is determined to fight to keep his
job.
Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of network television, yesterday admitted
in a BBC radio interview that both Mr Birt and the corporation had been
damaged by the revelation that Mr Birt he had been paid through a private
company, John Birt Productions. But Mr Wyatt insisted that the
director-general should not lose his job.
His comments followed calls by several Sunday newspapers for the resignation
of Mr Birt, and of Mr Hussey.
Mr Hussey last week vigorously defended Mr Birt. It later emerged that
several BBC governors had not given their support to his statement, and some
had not known of Mr Birt's freelance status.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BIG US airports along the east coast were closed for more than 24 hours by
the brutal weekend storm, stranding thousands and creating a nightmare for
national and international travel, Reuter reports from New York.
The New York area's three main airports - LaGuardia, John F Kennedy and
Newark - closed for more than 24 hours on Saturday and yesterday after the
worst winter storm of the century pounded the region with hurricane-force
winds and up to three feet of snow.
Thousands of airline ticket holders, trapped at the airports because of
cancelled flights, spent the night sleeping in plastic airport chairs and on
carpeted floors.
'The staff was very co-operative, they brought blankets and pillows,' said
one stranded passenger at Kennedy airport. 'But that floor has concrete
underneath it.'
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports,
said more than 3,400 people were stranded by the storm. 'It was not a good
day to be a ticketholder for a flight out of New York City,' said
spokeswoman Lynn Tierney.
The airports were expected to reopen late yesterday after thousands of
connecting flights all over the country and the world were disrupted.
Boston's Logan Airport reopened early yesterday but in Washington, Dulles
and National airports both remained closed. Philadelphia International
Airport reopened early yesterday.
In Atlanta, Delta Air Lines said it resumed limited flights yesterday
morning from the city's international airport after cancelling 1,000 flights
nationwide on Saturday.
A spokesman for President Bill Clinton said assessment teams were already
calculating the damage and would have a rough national figure in 24 to 48
hours.
Presidential spokesman George Stephanopoulos said Florida, hit by some 50
separate tornadoes, was the only state so far to request federal disaster
assistance.

As the Whitehall equivalent of the Squidgy tapes, bootleg recordings of a

becoming a collector's item in officialdom.
When the song was rendered at a staff party organised by Bill McLennan, the
Australian head of the Central Statistical Office who took over a year ago,
he was so impressed that he insisted the choir put the number on record. As
the official song includes references to Her Majesty's Treasury, Budget
purdah forbids full disclosure.
But the chorus will give a flavour:
Testing the market, testing the market,
Who'll come a -testing the market with me?
And he sang as we sighed and we waited to be Ozzified,
Who'll come a-testing the market with me?

Whether or not anyone knows quite what's what in the arcane sector of
finance known as 'derivatives', we now have a Who's Who therein - thanks to
a joint effort by Risk magazine and Intercapital Brokers.
What's more, by asking the sector's inhabitants about their 'lifestyle' in
the questionnaire, the publishers attempted to make all the so-called rocket
scientists with multiple degrees in nuclear physics sound a shade more
human.
'They are a cosmopolitan bunch, moving at ease between jobs in Tokyo, New
York, London, Paris . . .' oozes the accompanying blurb. But apparently
somewhat literal minded with it, a note at the front of the volume suggests.
Having asked the whizz kids taking part in the early stages to name their
'pet hate', the compilers were dismayed by replies expressing a 'high level
of distaste' for domestic animals. So the questionnaire was later amended to
ask: 'What do you most dislike?'
Alas we're not told whether the derivatives specialist who answered 'my
wife', was an early or a late participant.

Can the epic saga of the Dollars 25bn buy-out of RJR Nabisco work as
television comedy? While the critics must make up their own minds, certainly
plenty of laughs came from the elite Manhattans at the private preview of a
new Home Box Office television movie.
Called Barbarians at the Gate, it is based on the best-selling tale of Henry
Kravis, Ross Johnson and the battle for RJR Nabisco. Indeed, the preliminary
reception was graced by one of the book's co-authors, Bryan Burrough, who
left The Wall Street Journal recently for a highly paid perch at Vanity
Fair. But he ducked out of the show as soon as the lights went down.
Of the subsequent cackles, the most hysterical outburst was a true sign of
changing times on Wall Street. It came when the story moved to the home of
Jim and Linda Robinson, the former power couple from American Express. As
their telephone rang, a trimly dressed maid interrupted her task of ironing
dollar bills, and answered the call with: 'Robinson residence'.
The 1980s must really be over.

Whatever may befall John Birt's director-generalship of the BBC, wax
effigies of him transfixed with pins may soon be found in the hands of
Britain's self-employed.
Thanks to the furore over his arm's-length contractual arrangements with the
BBC while on his way through the deputy dg's job to the pole position, it
seems the chancellor of the exchequer might foreshadow a change of the rules
for the self-employed in tomorrow's Budget.
Gurus at the Institute of Taxation, the UK's professional body concerned
with said topic, believe Norman Lamont may begin introducing self-assessment
for the self-employed - on the lines of the pay and file system used for
corporation tax.
But mercifully, since it's proving difficult to devise a workable way of
saddling them with a brand new system of current-year taxation instead of
allowing them to earn now and pay later, the project is expected to take a
while to perfect. Perhaps another three years, the gurus say.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Observer: Exchanging bosses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not sure what it tells, but turnover in stock exchange bosses is starting to
pick up again. Only a day after Peter Rawlins stepped down as chief
executive of the London Stock Exchange last week, Rudiger von Rosen, chief
executive of the Deutsche Borse, announced he was quitting. Perhaps the
leaders of the New York Stock Exchange and the Paris Bourse ought to inspect
their employment contracts to see what they say about security of
employment.
The irony is that, while Rawlins left under a cloud, von Rosen leaves after
a record of considerable achievement. He joined the Frankfurt stock exchange
in 1986 from the Bundesbank where he had been head of communications for
Karl Otto Pohl, then president of the German central bank.
By most accounts, he did a good job persuading Germany's eight regional
bourses to bury their age-old rivalries in the interests of creating a
nationwide Deutsche Borse at the beginning of the year. But now he is being
replaced by a former Swiss management consultant, Werner Seifert, 44, who is
five years younger and works for Swiss Re in Zurich. He is said to be an
ally of Deutsche Bank's securities chief, Rolf Breuer, who also doubles up
as chairman of the Deutsche Borse.
If von Rosen had a fault it seems to have been his independent streak of
mind, which has irritated the big German banks. Only last week he said that
his ambition was to see Frankfurt dislodging London as Europe's leading
stock exchange, citing its technological edge. Breuer has the same objective
but feels happier about having a less controversial figure in place. Perhaps
London should follow suit when it comes to picking its next stock exchange
chieftain?

FT  15 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Keating's party trick
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE time came, Mr Paul Keating said, he would flick the switch to
vaudeville. And so he did. The Australian prime minister's victory in
Saturday's election is a triumph for his political skills and street-brawler
instincts. When he ousted Mr Bob Hawke in December 1991, the best hope of
the Labor party was that he would limit the extent of an apparently
inevitable defeat. Instead, he won by making the opposition's modest tax
reform plan, which was similar to one he himself had once advocated, appear
to be a fundamental attack on egalitarian Australia's way of life.
The conservatives become the latest opposition to rue tax proposals that
could be portrayed as increases likely to hit the broad electorate. In fact,
the general sales tax proposed by Mr John Hewson, the opposition leader,
would have been accompanied by abolition and reduction of other taxes. Food
prices might have fallen. But Mr Keating pressed every button guaranteed to
win votes: the GST would cause a blanket 15 per cent rise in prices of
everyday goods; it would benefit the rich at the expense of the poor; it
provoked Canadians into ejecting prime minister Brian Mulroney (at best,
only partly true).
That Labor should win a fifth consecutive term is the more remarkable given
that voting is compulsory and more than 1m of a population of 18m are
unemployed. Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, federal treasurer for eight years,
cannot carry all the blame for the recession from which Australia is
emerging. Financial deregulation in the 1980s brought an explosion in
financial assets and entrepreneurs' excesses.
Biggest problem
As a result, Australia's recession began earlier than those in the rest of
the industrialised world. But, overall, Labor's policies of opening up the
economy - reducing tariffs, floating the currency, deregulating markets,
freeing labour markets, and shifting the attention towards Asia - were what
Australia needed.
The biggest problem for Labor was that, like the Republicans in the US and
the Conservatives in Britain, the party ran out of new ideas. Mr Keating's
campaign provided little evidence that he has yet hit upon any. However, the
fact that he has now definitively established his party leadership may allow
him to force new blood into government.
After the pain of the recession, the new administration inherits a
fundamentally favourable situation, with the economy growing moderately,
inflation squeezed virtually to zero and rising demand generating higher
productivity. Its challenge - one in which Australia is scarcely unique - is
that the economy's projected growth, even after promised fiscal stimulus and
a likely further easing of monetary policy, is unlikely to be fast enough to
reduce unemployment.
Basic approach
This is not easy for any government to correct. However, a renewal of
Labor's basic approach of the 1980s would help the economy to grow along
lines likely to lead in the end to faster job creation. Labour reform has
slowed: exporters would be more competitive if labour market rigidities in
the docks and in domestic freight services were addressed. Tariff cuts need
to be implemented with greater determination, to help make the automobile,
textile and sugar industries more competitive. That would help redirect
investment capital into areas, such as computer software development, where
Australian industry is showing promising signs. Remaining curbs on financial
markets should be lifted.
The irony is that, while the ruthless campaign has narrowed his options, tax
reform should nevertheless be on Mr Keating's agenda. The current structure
is biased against exports and savings, both of which Australia, with its
heavy foreign debt burden, needs urgently to increase.
Mr Keating has made it clear that he sees Australia's future in Asia. Given
the extraordinary dynamism of the region, this is a sensible attitude which
he should develop further, even though its aim is partly a defence against
European and American trade blocs. If he is to hold office with as much
skill as he showed in winning it, however, he has to demonstrate that he has
a freshness of vision across other areas of policy as well.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Chancellor's opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET that will be delivered by Norman Lamont will be historic,
regardless of its content. It is to be the first of two due this year and
the last in which decisions on public spending are to be separate from those
on revenue. The question is whether what it contains will be worthy of the
stature historians are bound to accord it. The chancellor does, in fact,
enjoy a great opportunity, something that few may now believe after a
recession that has lasted two and a half years. Yet a chapter of accidents
has given the UK an excellent chance for sustained non-inflationary,
export-led growth.
What has created this opportunity? First, an ERM-induced monetary policy
tighter than any the UK is likely to have sustained on its own has pushed UK
underlying inflation - including its most important determinant, pay
inflation - towards levels not seen for a generation. Second, an abrupt,
unwanted, but fortuitous exit from the ERM has left sterling at a
competitive level. Third, the rapid deterioration in the performance of the
continental economies should lead to lower interest rates and so allow the
UK to sustain an aggressive monetary policy, without serious risk to the
exchange rate. Finally, the debt overhang has ended the damaging conflict of
the 1980s between the interest rates needed for domestic monetary control
and those allowing a tolerably competitive exchange rate.
Different views
How should the government exploit its opportunity? One thing it should not
do, as probably it knew all along, is pay too much attention to its panel of
seven wise men. It is not just that they have radically different views of
how the economy works. It is rather that from past experience their
recommendations are most likely to be wrong where there is the greatest
agreement. In this case, the most likely mistake is the consensus of six out
of the seven that tax increases, even if needed, should be postponed.
The fundamental question is whether the UK possesses a large structural
fiscal deficit. The chances are that it has one of 5 per cent of gross
domestic product or more. If so, either tax increases or radical curbs on
spending will be required to prevent an ultimately explosive increase in
public debt. Such an explosion is not merely a threat for the distant
future. The fear that it could happen is also likely to limit what could be
the most valuable single development of the next several years, namely, a
sustained reduction in the nominal interest rate on long-term bonds.
Nascent recovery
The good reason for postponing tax increases is fear of what they might do
to the nascent recovery. That may be a reason for delaying introduction of
tax increases until 1994-95, but the intention to make those adjustments
needs to be announced now, which may itself rob the postponement of its
benefits. The case for postponement has, in any case, been weakened by exit
from the ERM, which allows any adverse effects of tax increases, almost
certainly exaggerated by unreconstructed Keynesians, to be offset by a
sufficiently aggressive monetary policy.
The job of the chancellor is to convince the markets that tax increases or
spending cuts equivalent to a fiscal adjustment of at least 3 per cent of
GDP will be introduced over at most the next two years. It is also to
introduce changes in the tax system that would reduce its distorting effects
on the economy. It would be wonderful if the chancellor managed to combine
the needed credible commitment to fiscal rebalancing with imaginative tax
reform. But it may be too much to ask for.
One member of the Treasury's panel of forecasters has argued that an outcome
of less than 1 per cent growth this year would be a 'disaster'. This
exaggeration does much to explain the persistent instability of British
macroeconomic policy, which has, in turn, done so much damage to the British
economy. What would, indeed, be a disaster is for the present opportunity
for sustained growth to be frittered away in yet another unsustainable
expansion, followed by a deeply damaging recession later in the 1990s. Even
the UK should be able to learn from past failures. The time to show it has
done so is now.

FT  15 MAR 93 / The deal they were condemned to do: The state of the German
economy helped drive the politicians to agree a solidarity pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delight, relief and exhaustion were apparent in almost equal proportions on
the faces of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Bjorn Engholm, the German
opposition leader, on Saturday night.
After two and a half days of almost unrelieved negotiations over the fine
details of the long-awaited solidarity pact to finance German unification, a
deal on the central component - public finances and burden-sharing - had
been done.
When it comes to analysing the figures, the holes in the pact are certain to
emerge. But at 8pm in the chancellor's office in Bonn, where they had been
shut away so long from a gloriously sunny, premature spring weekend, nobody
was picking holes. It was time for mutual congratulation.
The entire German top political establishment - the chancellor and his
principal ministers, the leading figures in all the main parliamentary
parties, and the 16 prime ministers of the German federal states - had
thrashed out a political agreement on the soaring cost of subsidising east
Germany for the foreseeable future. They had agreed on how to split the cost
between the central government and the wealthy western states. And they had
done it at a time when the overwhelming majority of observers doubted their
ability to do so, and had even begun to question their very powers of
leadership.
Mr Kohl, that master of the understatement, called it 'a good result' and 'a
very considerable achievement'. Everybody had had to compromise, he said,
and all had been willing to do so.
Mr Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who had put his
own political credibility at stake in the exercise of reaching cross-party
agreement, went further. 'We have taken a huge stride towards the
realisation of German unity,' he said. 'That was the aim, and that is the
result. Seldom before have I found two and a half days so useful and so
fruitful.'
As for the prime ministers of the German Lander, whose budgets face a
critical squeeze from unification in the coming years, they were also
overwhelmingly positive.
Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the Christian Democrat prime minister of Saxony, the
industrial heartland of east Germany, called the deal 'a success for the
federal Germany, and a success for a united Germany.
'Many doubted whether it was possible for 16 Lander to agree with the
federal government on such a complex deal,' he said. 'We have succeeded in
cutting the Gordian knot and in reaching a tolerable conclusion.'
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD premier of the Rhineland Palatinate in the
west, said it was above all 'a success for the major parties and perhaps a
signal that the endless to-ing and fro-ing is at an end'.
The deal they have done is certainly less than ideal. The aim of the package
was to squeeze western Germany - both the central government and the states
 -in order to finance a transfer to the eastern states in 1995 of DM110bn
(Pounds 46.6bn), including DM40bn for servicing the accumulated debts of the
east. That has to be done while the western economy is in recession, after a
sharp downturn in the last quarter.
Mr Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, his finance minister, wanted to cut western
spending, including the bloated social security budgets; to postpone any tax
rise until 1995, to allow the economy time to recover (and the 1994
elections to take place); and to keep any call on the capital markets to a
minimum, to encourage the German Bundesbank to carry on cutting interest
rates.
Mr Engholm and the SPD wanted no cuts in social spending and a much earlier
tax rise to meet the immediate spending gap.
In the event, the deal will raise taxes from January 1995 by a painful 7.5
per cent surcharge on income tax, and an increase in the wealth tax: the
amount is about double what Mr Waigel had intended, but at least it will not
come into effect until 1995.
He has agreed to give the Lander nearly DM20bn in extra tax revenues, to
help them pay for transfers to east Germany, by raising their share of value
added tax receipts from 37 to 44 per cent. That will relieve them of what
they all regarded as quite unbearable pressure on their spending plans.
Public sector borrowing will rise significantly, thanks to an increase in
the borrowing limit of the Treuhand privatisation agency by DM30bn, to allow
it to finance further restructuring of 'core industries' which it cannot
sell, and to clean up the ecological havoc they have caused. At the same
time the Bank for Reconstruction will be allowed to raise its borrowing
limit from DM30bn to DM60bn to finance housing modernisation in the east.
As for savings measures, Mr Engholm won an absolute commitment that there
would be no cuts in social spending. So the two sides simply agreed on a
figure for savings - DM9.2bn at the central government level - and
instructed the finance ministers to identify the necessary cuts. However, if
they fail to meet the target, the Lander will have to forfeit the
corresponding amount from their VAT revenue: that is Mr Waigel's secret
weapon.
It all seems to fall well short of what the Bundesbank was looking for: a
clear commitment to budget cuts, and no increase in the overall public
sector indebtedness. Last night, the Bundesbank was studiously, if somewhat
sceptically, refusing to comment on the deal.
Yet it would be wrong to underrate the importance of the deal, for it is,
above all, a political as opposed to purely financial agreement. 'This is a
vital step in bringing unification into our consciousness,' Mr Biedenkopf
said yesterday.
It will also provide certainty and reassurance for the private sector, at a
moment when the investment climate is gloomy, Mr Scharping said. 'That is of
decisive importance for the Bundesbank.'
The state of the German economy was decisive in driving the negotiators
towards a deal, and in reinforcing the government's resistance to any tax
rise before 1995, but equally in weakening the government's insistence on
firm spending cuts to be agreed before they went home.
The key to the deal was the tax trade-off, reached by Mr Waigel and the main
body of state premiers in a working group on Friday night. That is where the
deal between a higher VAT take for the Lander, against a higher solidarity
surcharge for the central government, was done.
The other key was the question of social spending cuts. Everyone agreed they
would try to find savings of up to DM3bn from clamping down on
social-security swindles. Mr Kohl wanted the savings to be identified by May
 -and, if not, the original cuts to be reinstated. Mr Engholm flatly
refused. Mr Kohl got the tax deal, Mr Engholm the social spending.
In spite of the overwhelmingly sceptical view of the German media that the
pact would never come to pass, most of those involved always said they were
'condemned to agree'.
Mr Engholm, in particular, was clear that he wanted an agreement and would
get one. He, like Mr Kohl, is instinctively a man of consensus and
compromise. That is why both are accused of failing to give clear
leadership. When they left Saturday night's closing press conference, Mr
Kohl took Mr Eng-holm's arm and squeezed it, a gesture which said more about
their temporary alliance than any words.
There is no doubt that the local election results from the state of Hesse,
just six days before, concentrated minds powerfully. Mr Kohl's Christian
Democrats did badly - losing 2.3 per cent on a previous bad score. Mr
Engholm's SPD did even worse, losing 8.4 per cent of its share of the vote.
Both men were reinforced in their determination to show they could do
business in Bonn - not simply shout slogans at each other.
The question now is how the pact, in all its inevitable pain, will be sold
to the nation, and whether the lower ranks in the leading parties will still
try to pull it apart. That is precisely where the leadership powers of both
Mr Kohl and Mr Eng-holm will be challenged.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Personal View: Myth of America's decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J BOSKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The notion that the American economy is in a long-run structural decline has
been advanced over the last decade by academic and media pundits. These
pundits clamour for expanded government spending programmes, protectionist
trade policies and government subsidies for special commercial technologies.
In Europe and Japan pundits gleefully proclaim that the US has been
eclipsed, and that the next century 'belongs' to Asia or to Europe.
The declinists insist that America is lagging behind its economic
competitors (especially Japan and Germany), is de-industrialising, and that
economic collapse is just around the corner. In a revisionist history, the
declinists - some now occupy high positions in the Clinton administration -
blame the 'decline' on the 'failed policies of the 1980s'. The declinists'
allegations form the premise for President Clinton's economic programme.
The American economy does, indeed, face serious challenges, most importantly
raising productivity growth, but even with a healthy discount for political
hyperbole, these allegations are nonsense.
The US remains the world's largest, richest and most productive economy.
With less than 5 per cent of the world's population, it produces about a
quarter of the world's total output of goods and services. The average
standard of living - measured by the total value of output per person -
exceeds that of any other leading industrialised country, being 20-30 per
cent higher than in Germany and Japan. Productivity is also higher, as is
average private sector pay, than in these other nations.
The fortunes of particular industries have ebbed and flowed, but America is
not de-industrialising. Neither is it losing its overall competitive edge.
The US is the world's leading exporter and, although many US manufacturers
face stiff competition in markets with high volume and low profit margins,
America has maintained or enhanced its technological edge in areas such as
microprocessors, advanced telecommunications, biotechnology, aerospace,
chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
The American economy is currently faring far better than those of the other
leading industrialised countries. The US is producing about 3 per cent more
industrial output than a year ago, while Germany, France and Italy are
producing 4 per cent less, and Japan 8 per cent less.
What happened in the 1980s? The longest peacetime economic expansion in the
nation's history, from late 1982 to mid-1990, followed a successful, but
costly, taming of the 1970s double-digit inflation, as 20m new jobs and
millions of new businesses were created. Real GDP grew 30 per cent.
Productivity rebounded slightly, real wages continued to grow slowly, and
the wage premium for educated workers increased, but less-educated young
workers faced bleaker prospects. Persistently large budget deficits
developed, as federal spending grew relative to GDP, while revenues were
stabilised by cutting tax rates and indexing for inflation. The national
debt rose by Dollars 2 trillion, but private wealth increased five times as
much.
In short, it was a decade of generally successful economic performance,
although serious problems remained and new ones emerged.
I agree with the pundits of decline on one point: America will not remain
the world's strongest economy unless productivity growth improves
substantially.
America saves and invests too little. Its federal government spends and
borrows too much. Its education system is woefully in need of reform. Its
tax system has become less conducive to entrepreneurship, saving and
investment. The government regulates too much private activity. The legal
system imposes unnecessary costs on consumers and companies, and stifles
innovation. Too many Americans depend on a welfare system that penalises
work, saving and intact families.
An aggressive reform agenda focused on these issues, as well as a successful
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt, is America's best bet for
achieving sufficiently rising standards of living to provide a better legacy
of prosperity to its children, and opportunity to the disadvantaged.
The new administration seems intent on addressing these problems with new
government programmes, higher tax rates, increased and less flexible
regulation, and trade protection - rather than through reforms that empower
individuals and families, and strengthen the market system. If implemented,
such a programme, inspired by the declinists, eventually might become a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Vision of peace starts to flicker: Mideast peace talks have
stalled since Yitzhak Rabin's election in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Yitzhak Rabin meets President Bill Clinton in Washington today, he will
present the US leader with a symbolic - if unoriginal - statuette of the
dove of peace.
Though Mr Clinton may be charmed by its elegance, many people in the Middle
East may wonder whether it is an appropriate gift from a man whose
commitment to push for peace in the region has been called into question
since he was elected prime minister of Israel last June.
Such were the hopes and expectations that accompanied Mr Rabin's triumph
over the long-dominant Likud party and its obdurate leader, Mr Yitzhak
Shamir, that it was not uncommon to hear the new premier compared as an
agent of change with President F W de Klerk of South Africa. Mr Rabin
himself spoke of reaching within nine months a critical first-stage
agreement with the Palestinians on the keystone issue of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Now those nine months have almost passed and such a breakthrough does not
seem much closer. Instead, Mr Rabin and Mr Clinton will discuss how to
salvage the process of peace negotiations between Israel and its Arab
neighbours begun under Mr Shamir, but which has faltered since last
December.
Over the past three months, the talks have been derailed by Mr Rabin's
decision in mid-December to expel summarily more than 400 Palestinians to
Lebanon following a spate of killings of Israeli soldiers by Moslem
fundamentalists. The shock that the unprecedented expulsions caused has been
compounded by a spiral of violence in the occupied territories that has
pushed casualty tolls back towards the levels of the early days of the
intifada, the five-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule. So
far the Palestinians have refused an invitation by the US and Russia,
co-sponsors of the peace process, to reopen negotiations next month.
The Palestinians - some of whom had imagined that Mr Rabin might do for the
West Bank and Gaza what French President Charles de Gaulle did for Algeria -
express exasperation. 'Rabin is simply not ready to make peace,' says a
senior West Bank leader. Instead of de Gaulle - or de Klerk - they see an
old military foe who led such bitter campaigns against them as the mass
expulsions of Arabs from the towns of Lydda and Ramle during the 1948
Arab-Israeli war and the crushing defeat of the 1967 six-day war.
But is the irascible Mr Rabin really little more than a tough ex-general who
lacks the vital extra dimension of peacemaker? Certainly, he never could be
described as a dove. In his own Labour party, he has long been the leader of
its hawkish faction, scorning colleagues who would negotiate openly with the
Palestine Liberation Organisation and accept, ultimately, Palestinian
statehood in the West Bank and Gaza.
He will never, say his aides, negotiate directly with what he calls 'the
Tunis gang' - the Tunis-based PLO leadership of Mr Yasser Arafat - which
most Arabs argue is as vital to the peace process in the Middle East as is
the African National Congress to negotiated change in South Africa.
But this is by no means the full story. Mr Rabin is prepared, in line with
Labour policy, to cede 'land for peace' - that is, to return to Arab rule
large portions of the West Bank and Gaza. He offers no shift on Israel's
determination to maintain control over all of Jerusalem and its environs and
he sees Palestinian sovereignty as being expressed through a union of sorts
with Jordan, not independence. But he has made no bones about his belief
that Israel can achieve peace only through making territorial compromises.
Most strikingly, Mr Rabin has repeatedly said he is willing to sanction a
significant Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights as the price for peace
with Syria, Israel's most threatening neighbour. Since the election, he has
been encouraged by what he sees as positive signals from President Hafez
al-Assad in Damascus - and discouraged by the lack of progress on the West
Bank and Gaza. As a result, he has reversed his earlier strategy of dealing
first with the Palestinians before negotiating seriously with Syria.
Moreover, this apparent willingness to make concessions reflects Mr Rabin's
sense that he is playing a historical role. He had a prominent part as a
young commander in Israel's fight for independence in 1948; he was chief of
staff when the West Bank, east Jerusalem, Gaza and the Golan were captured
in 1967. Now, at 71, he wants to be the leader who achieves a broad-fronted
peace. 'It is his last chance and he doesn't want to lose the chance,' says
a close associate.
However, while de Gaulle and de Klerk took decisive paths, Mr Rabin is
hesitant over how to proceed. This stems in part from his fear of the
opposition he might face from Israel's volatile and often violent right
wing. At the same time, he seems to lack conviction about how far he should
go.
Mr Rabin's tightly knit circle of officials and advisers now says that
Labour's election victory - which enabled it to form a coalition with the
left-liberal group Meretz and the Shas religious party - did not constitute
a mandate for a sharp change in policy. One called it 'an accident' in which
concerns over the economy, corruption within the Likud and the swing vote of
Russian immigrants delivered the shift from the Likud's unyielding 'greater
Israel' stance to the 'land for peace' policy of Labour and Meretz.
'Rabin knows it better than anyone - that Israel still thinks Likud,' said
the same official. The argument is that, in the absence of a dramatic event
such as a summit between Mr Rabin and President Assad, public opinion will
take time and careful education to change.
A move has been made - mainly through speeches and interviews by Mr Rabin -
to plant the idea among Israelis that important concessions will be needed
on the Golan and, eventually, in the West Bank and Gaza as well. But the
limits have not been defined, nor the time-scale set out.
Mr Rabin has said that the opportunity for a breakthrough in the peace talks
will not last long. He fears that Islamic fundamentalism and a resurgent
Iran may pull regional developments in a more menacing direction for Israel
if agreements are not reached soon - perhaps by the end of this year. The
Israeli public, too, may have limited patience if he cannot fulfil his
election promises of peace. What seems to be missing is a clear vision of
what has to be done to achieve it, and a willingness to carry it through.
'Peace does not mean paradise, but if there is no peace there will be hell
and Rabin is aware of that,' says Professor Yehoshafat Harkabi, an expert on
the Arab-Israeli conflict and intelligence adviser to Mr Rabin.
'The problem is what price he is willing to pay for peace. I am suspicious
that he himself is not sure how far he is prepared to go.'

FT  15 MAR 93 / Letter: 'Wise man' letter a serious contribution to public
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor TIM CONGDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised by your economics correspondent's account of my open
letter to the Treasury Panel (' 'Wise man' attacks wisdom of fellow
economists', March 6). I would not dream of embarking on public criticism of
my fellow panellists' intellectual capabilities, for which I have in any
case a high regard. The point of my letter was to suggest their professional
interests have been misdirected. In particular, I believe they have been
mistaken in failing to integrate money and banking into their analysis and
forecasting of Britain's economy.
Your readers may be interested to know that I proposed during the panel's
discussions that a section on 'monetary developments' be included in the
report. I received no support for this proposal from any of the other
panellists.
I regard the future behaviour of the British economy as strongly influenced
by the rate of (broad) money growth. Specifically, if broad money growth
between now and end-1994 is 30 per cent I would expect the level of economic
activity and prices in 1995 to be very different than if it were 5 per cent.
But one member of the panel - Mr Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs - said
explicitly in his submission that he was sceptical that faster monetary
growth (due, say, to a change in funding policy) would have any significant
impact on the economy. As far as I can tell, none of the panel thought that
changes in the rate of monetary growth could cause subsequent changes in
economic activity.
I am, of course, open to correction and would like to think that I have
misunderstood my fellow panellists' views on this matter. May I suggest two
questions for them to clarify their views? They might perhaps answer in your
columns.
Is the equivalence of the demand for and supply of money balances an
important aspect of macroeconomic equilibrium? If so, what definition of the
quantity of money is relevant to the determination of that equilibrium?
I would also like to express surprise at the various comments on my open
letter made by some of the panellists. These included references to
'immoderation', 'excitability', 'unhelpfulness', even 'craziness' and the
possibility of libel proceedings. As a matter of fact, none of the
panellists had been sent the letter when they ventured these remarks, as it
was still at the printers or in the post over the weekend in question. I
intended the letter to be a serious contribution to a public debate which is
of vital importance to the future of our country. I had hoped it would be
taken in this spirit.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Letter: Recognition for role of engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOHN C WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The 'Personal View' of Dr Pendlebury and Mr Shipley (March 3) should be
read by all who want to stem the recent tide of decline in manufacturing in
the UK. The task may not be as difficult as might be imagined.
Recognition that an engineering career is vital to the wealth creation
process is recognised in France and Germany, where a university engineering
course is prized by students and encouraged by parents. In Singapore, an
early education incorporating experience and practice in engineering is
understood to be an excellent entry into senior positions in government,
commerce and business. Surely it should not be difficult to appreciate that
this hands-on experience is more relevant to national success than an
Oxbridge 'greats' degree.
The mood of change could be rapid as evidenced by the prime minister's
reported comments on the importance of manufacturing ('Major urges companies
to be aggressive', March 4). However, it is also vital that the industrial
leaders in manufacturing recognise this change and promote the training and
recognition of all engineers.
I would thus only add to the Personal View the comment that chartered
engineers have a prime responsibility to ensure that the support role of
incorporated engineers and engineering technicians is championed as well.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Letter: Settlement crucial to protecting profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LAURENCE D PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I fully concur with your leader ('Taurus done to death', March 12).
However, I contend that it contains a flawed argument in respect of
settlement. The success of the Stock Exchange's Seaq International dealing
service has not been achieved despite the shortcomings of settlement in
London, as in almost all cases settlement of these transactions takes place
in the domestic location of the particular stock, ie Paris for French
stocks, Frankfurt for German stocks.
As a settlements manager with more than 20 years' experience in the City I
also venture to suggest that if one was to ask the principals of any leading
securities house or investment bank whether or not settlements were crucial,
the answer in the 1990s would be a resounding yes. Increasing competition
and ever-decreasing margins on front-end profitability mean that accurate,
prompt and efficient settlement of transactions is the only way of
protecting a firm's hard-earned profit.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Letter: Labour not cynical in pressing its Maastricht
amendment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JACK CUNNINGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You seem either unable or unwilling to understand why Labour moved and
voted for the successful amendment on the Committee of the Regions ('Major
must persevere', March 10).
The import of the sanctimonious message in your leading article is that we
should 'rubber stamp' a government bill to which we always have had
fundamental objections. How can you legitimately describe as cynical an
opposition party which expresses its view clearly, moves an amendment to
legislation, and states its intention to vote for it?
Our aim was to ensure that our delegation to the committee is truly
representative of the nations and regions of the UK when dealing with the
institutions of the European Community. Our argument that elected
representatives from local government should make up the 24 members was
accepted by the Commons on March 8.
As you rightly say it is Mr Major's own rebels who are filibustering on the
Maastricht legislation. They have not been bought off by the Tory leader's
opt-out on the Social Chapter - the first of many miscalculations by the
prime minister over Maastricht. You fail to mention it was Mr Major who, in
a state of panic last November, promised to delay third reading of the bill
until the second Danish referendum.
Your charge of cynicism would be more appropriate to a prime minister who
promised delay and now complains of opposition amendments.
To say the 'government's tactics have been less than brilliant' is a
laughable understatement of reality. But serious government misjudgments are
no reason for an opposition to refrain from pressing its own ideas in the
House of Commons.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Taken out of service: How BR's privatisation will affect its
pension plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The politics of privatising British Rail are fraught enough as it is. But
the implications for British Rail pensioners are turning out to be almost as
big an irritant for ministers and officials as the restructuring of the rail
system. Controversial proposals advanced by the government in January have
prompted a host of anxious retired rail folk to make full use of a commodity
with which they are richly endowed - time - to deluge the Department of
Transport with letters and phone calls. The result is that a chastened
government is preparing to beat a rapid retreat in the face of pensioner
power.
The government's problem is that the railways are being privatised
piecemeal. A single employer will be replaced by several employers ranging
from the manager of the track-owning company, Railtrack, to the holders of
franchises to run passenger services. With more than 200,000 pensioners and
deferred pensioners in the British Rail pension schemes, far outnumbering
existing employees, it would be difficult to allocate pensioners to the
successor companies after privatisation.
Existing BR employees have been promised pension benefits in a joint
industry scheme that will be no less favourable than the present
arrangements. This looks reasonable enough, although it remains to be seen
whether other rights such as representation on trustee boards turn out to be
comparable. But the deal offered to pensioners is more controversial.
The government has offered two options. The first involves putting money
into a closed scheme, where pensioners would be dependent for security on
future investment performance. There would be no government undertaking to
provide a continuing guarantee of either the fund's solvency or the
index-linking of benefits.
The second option would, in effect, involve the nationalisation of the
pensioners' money. The government would agree to pay the same benefits
promised in the existing rules, rising in line with the retail price index.
Further improvements in pension benefits would be ruled out. Because the
government would be taking on a commitment to pay pensions in exchange for
acquiring the scheme's assets, the Treasury would then have to dispose of
Pounds 8.5bn of mainly equity-type investments. This would be helpful in
funding a soaring public-sector borrowing requirement since it would take
pressure off the gilt market. But once the marketable equities had been
sold, it would leave a headache for the hapless officials required to manage
a rump of less liquid investments, ranging from great tracts of
Aberdeenshire to office blocks in the capital.
Neither of the two options is very palatable for the pensioners, most of
whom receive very modest weekly sums from their fund. In a closed fund with
no new cash flow, trustees would be obliged to run a low-risk, low-return
investment policy. That is dismal news, especially for older beneficiaries
on low pensions, for whom recent high investment returns have been a boon.
Not only would their hopes of any uplift in benefits in future be dashed;
they would also lose the security they enjoy in the present scheme. Under
option two, they would enjoy full, inflation-proof security, but no uplift
in benefits arising from good investment performance.
On the face of it, the pensioners would be short-changed, since at present
most of them enjoy both index-linking and the fruits of good investment
performance. The government has nonetheless argued that the index-linking in
the main BR scheme is not cast-iron. A clause in the trust deeds allows BR
to wind up and distribute the funds if they fall into deficit. Yet the
circumstances in which this would happen are almost impossible to conceive.
The BR schemes are not like private-sector pension funds in which the
employer guarantees to meet the balance of the cost of pensions after
employees have made a fixed contribution. BR and the employees share an
agreed proportion of the cost of meeting the level of benefits specified in
the rules. As long as BR's continuing monopoly was not in question,
contributions could have been adjusted on actuarial advice to ensure that
deficits were only transitory. So the winding-up clause was academic and the
index-linking secure.
Officials now privately concede that the two options proposed in January are
dead in their existing form. The question is whether they can be turned into
something more promising. On the index-linked formula, some consideration
has been given to offering an alternative to the RPI. But a link to earnings
would be politically difficult after the state scheme's move from
earnings-related pensions to the less costly RPI. And a notional link to the
performance of the joint industry fund would raise questions about how the
government would provide security for pensions.
An alternative approach now being actively pursued is to find a way of
putting the pensioners into the joint industry fund alongside members still
in employment. But to do this, the actuaries would have to overcome an
uncomfortable demographic fact: 40 per cent of the members who are still in
employment would be supporting 60 per cent who are existing and deferred
pensioners. The Inland Revenue would also have to be satisfied that there
were no cross-subsidies between the various employers before granting its
approval. And the government would probably have to offer some kind of
security guarantee. This it would be reluctant to do without retaining a
right to interfere in order to protect the taxpayers' interests.
At this stage it looks like an intellectual and political minefield. But
ministers still have one possible card up their sleeves. An actuarial
valuation of the fund is due on April 1 and the results will be known by
autumn. They are expected to show a much diminished surplus. If that causes
militant pensioners to conclude that, even without privatisation, uplifts in
benefits in the existing fund would have been much rarer in the 1990s than
in the 1980s, they could be more open to the government's ideas when they
emerge. But at this stage all that is certain is that the saga will run and
run.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Arts: Radiant Ravel - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Except in the most ingenious and tactful productions L'Enfant et les
Sortileges, the 'fantaisie lyrique' Ravel wrote with Colette, is rarely as
enchanting on stage as it can be in concert. Colette's little moral fable
animates such a variety of things - chairs and crockery, birds and beasts,
wallpaper and the fire on the hearth - that the stagecraft may detract from
the radiant tenderness of the score.
On Friday, Simon Rattle and his City of Birmingham Symphony brought it off
charmingly in the Festival Hall. Elise Ross sang an appealing Child, neither
too winsome nor too fretful, though 'Toi, le coeur de la rose' can never be
simple enough (and wasn't here). Lillian Watson made a gracious Princess,
though in quite unintelligible French; and was it her choice or Rattle's to
take the Fire's music so slowly? No sparks there; the Ashes who swallow her
up were more effective, with a good chamber choir from the Welsh College of
Music and Drama.
The rest of the personnel, doubling and tripling roles as required, were
first-rate. In even more roles than that, Christine Cairns was delightful,
starting with reproachful Maman; the duet of her Chinese Cup and Peter
Hall's Wedgwood Teapot was both magical and funny. Mary King and David
Wilson-Johnson yowled the X-rated Cats with high relish (and uncommon
accuracy, too).
The other sub-principals, Lynda Russell and David Thomas, were no less in
the spirit of the thing, and Rattle - once past a rushed opening (the
winding oboes were too sprightly to suggest the right static torpor) - lit
up many pages of the score: a tripping beat in the shepherds' music, a
haunted garden-vista with night birds (the muttering animals a touch too
loud, though), an elegant dragonfly ballet.
This fetching performance deserved a fuller house. Perhaps the first half of
this 'Toward the Millenium' programme failed to entice: middle-period Frank
Bridge, and his 14-year-old pupil Benjamin Britten. Bridge's Enter Spring is
bright and well-made, very much of its period, and thoroughly English in its
gait and manner despite all its Debussyisms. Somehow it has never seemed to
take a firm hold on concert-goers' imaginations: too sturdily made, perhaps.
As for Britten's Four French Songs, delicately limned here by Lynda Russell,
they are precocious and eclectic, but too jerry-built to be satisfying
rather than 'interesting'. It does the composer no service to pretend that
they belong to the real Britten canon - they are curiosities, not grown-up
concert fare.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Arts: Weber's 'Der Freischutz' - Opera in Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ruth Berghaus fan club is growing - if you judge by the number of
continental opera house managements playing along with her theatrical
riddles. The east German director's footprints are now so commonplace that
the novelty value of her pioneering west European productions has given way
to predictability, in the way she approaches each work and the extreme
reactions she provokes. But the new staging of Der Freischutz at the Zurich
Opera House was different, if only because she was working for the first
time with Nikolaus Harnoncourt.
Harnoncourt has been searching for a compatible operatic partner ever since
the death of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, with whom he worked so profitably on
Zurich's Monteverdi and Mozart cycles. On the surface, Berghaus and
Harnoncourt have something in common. They approach the work in hand without
preconceptions based on tradition or received opinion. Both are a fund of
stimulating ideas and insights, and both challenge you to think: there is
never a dull moment. Nor can you ignore the exactness of observation and
execution they bring to everything they do.
There the similarities end. Where Berghaus uses each opera as a floor for
her own theatrical fantasy, Harnoncourt's priority is reading the composer's
mind - based on textual fidelity. Rarely can Weber's early Romantic score
have sounded less folksy-sentimental or so expressionist. The music emerged
full of unvarnished timbres, unexpected instrumental voices, sudden impulses
and unsettling harmonies. You hear what Wagner heard in Weber, the Wolf's
Glen scene providing a clear pre-echo of Alberich's 'Horst du, Hagen, mein
Sohn?'. None of the tempo extremes were gratuitous: even the beautifully
still opening to 'Leise, leise' seemed to heighten the music's inner
tension.
Above all, Harnoncourt reminds us that the Freischutz of Weber and Kind lies
somewhere between heaven and hell. Berghaus's Freischutz, by contrast, is
all hell - a nightmare vision of humanity. The devil-figure of Samiel is
ever-present, dancing across stage at the start of each scene in the same
black hat and cape as the rest of the cast. The Hermit and Ottokar have no
identity other than as spokesmen for church and state within a drab
Brechtian society. There is no forest, the action unfolding instead against
a background of abstract panels (designed by Hartmut Meyer). Nor is there a
glint of hope: in the final scene, the people brush themselves clean from
the preceding unpleasantness, as history prepares to repeat itself.
All this tells us more about Berghaus, her political beliefs and theatrical
influences, than it does about Freischutz. As usual, she has nothing to say
about individual characters, and the Wolf's Glen - Weber's masterstroke as a
musical dramatist - is flattened into a series of pretentious choreographic
routines. After Achim Freyer's landmark Stuttgart production of the early
1980s, it would be a poor soul who wanted to return to Freischutz with stage
extras dressed up as wild boars. But with Berghaus, the drive to
demythologise Freischutz as one of the great German cultural emblems goes
too far.
Matti Salminen's Kaspar dominated the Zurich cast with his giant figure and
bear-hug of a voice, probably too generous in timbre for the role. Reiner
Goldberg's Max, playing a bookish Faust to Salminen's grandiose Mephisto,
sounded like someone who has sung a part too often. Inga Nielsen was a cool
Agathe, Malin Hartelius a pretty, unsoubrettish Aennchen.

<TEXT>
Hopes that BBC2 might resist the proletarianisation of television proceeding
so fast on other channels look slim when series such as Soundbites start to
arrive (7.30 BBC2). Like 'Harry Enfield's Guide To Opera' this assumes that
those who grew fond of 'Nessun Dorma' during the World Cup and 'The Four
Seasons' now that soccer fan Nigel Kennedy has recorded it, will go for
other classical music provided it is camouflaged heavily enough. Thus today
we are promised that the 'soundbites' will include a mouthful from
trombonist Christian Lindberg 'in full leather bike gear'. Oh good. Horizon
sets out to discover 'Whatever happened to star wars', Ronald Reagan's super
wizzo giant ray gun system for shooting enemy missiles out of the sky (8.00
BBC2). World In Action reveals that almost half the UK's ambulance services
are failing to meet government standards. Perhaps we ought to have a
patients' charter . . . (8.30 ITV). At the beginning, the young doctors in
Medics spent as much time visiting one another's beds as their patients'.
Now it is just another bedpan and face-mask hospital series (9.00 ITV).

FT  15 MAR 93 / Arts: Squirrels - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Mamet's short comedy at the King's Head in Islington is a gloriously
superficial play on words and meanings, here magnificently performed by the
cast of three. Whether it would stand up to acting and direction any less
good must be open to doubt, for I am beginning to think that the best of
modern American theatre depends on style and playing rather than writing and
substance. John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation comes to mind.
Squirrels is about writer's block, or at least that is the ostensible
subject. It could be equally about anyone losing their grip on words, memory
and associations and picking them up from other people, except that it is
pitched at quite a high intellectual level. It is like Harold Pinter, with
more wit and less menace, and played faster.
The writer with the block is called Arthur. Was this a dig at Arthur Miller
before his Indian summer? There must be some association here. Anyway, this
Arthur is a short story writer. Played by Edward Petherbridge (no less), he
is in search of a symbolic story involving squirrels (or perhaps just one)
in New York's Central Park. The pursuit has been going on for some 15 years.
'The squirrel,' says Arthur's young assistant (Steven O'Shea), 'is a
potentially non-representational animal.' The real question, however, is
whether a squirrel has guts, and the question behind the question is whether
Arthur can put guts into his story.
They try it on the drawing board. They try the opening sentences over and
over again, the assistant gaining an increasingly assertive role. There is
also the influence of the cleaning woman (Sara Kestelman) who has writing
aspirations of her own. In the end, squirrels get nowhere: Arthur turns to
geese, but not without diversions along the way. There is a marvellous line
about a lady walking in Central Park who has forgotten to feed her Doberman
for three weeks.
In the meantime, we have been through quite a lot of literary theory. 'What
is a metaphysical restaurant?' 'Oh, it's just an idea really.' 'What does it
mean?' 'To me, or in general?' And so it goes on, gently, lightly,
amusingly.
The cast is terrific. The key to Petherbridge's Arthur is not that he has
given way to drugs, cosmic boredom or anything like that: he has genuine
writer's block. The blank sheet of foolscap can begin to fill him with
fright. As his assistant, O'Shea has no special hang-ups either. He is a
literature graduate who just wants to write: at the start he even wears his
college tie, (Arthur being in a base ball cap). Ms Kestelman does a lot of
her playing by looks: sometimes quizzical, sometimes inviting, always
captivating, permanently sure of herself. This is not the kind of part that
would come from a British writer. She appears utterly classless, and no one
comments.
Mamet's new play Oreanna, about academic sexual harassment, will be
presented at the Royal Court in June directed by Harold Pinter. The mouth
waters.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Office development plan in Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A joint venture between COSTAIN (AFRICA) and JOHN SISK &amp; SON (PVT) has been
awarded a contract by Old Mutual Properties for a major office development
in Harare, worth Pounds 24m.
The project, which is believed to be the largest of its kind in Zimbabwe,
includes 26,000 sq metres of office space in two identical blocks, separated
by an eight-storey atrium, which will provide an American-style indoor
shopping mall, with more than 50 shops. The development includes an unusual
passive ventilation system, which will provide comfortable conditions within
the building, without resorting to air conditioning.
The scheme, developed by the architect, Pearce Partnership and engineers Ove
Arup &amp; Partners, uses the concrete structure of the building to produce cool
air.
The Costain-Sisk joint venture has reduced the anticipated construction
programme by offering an alternative design for the substructure works. This
allows the two-storey basement car park to be constructed using a bored pile
perimeter retaining wall, which will be geonailed back to the surrounding
soil to give temporary lateral support whilst the permanent construction is
under way.
Work on the development is scheduled for completion in 34 months time.

Costain, the struggling construction and mining company, has opted to
promote its internal candidate, chief financial officer Alan Lovell, to the
position of finance director following an outside search to fill the job
vacated by Tom Slee at the end of last year.
Group chief executive Peter Costain says the headhunters short-listed three
outside candidates. 'We wanted to test the market because Alan had only just
started at the time. But in his four months with us he has impressed all
those working with him, including the banks.' He reports that the other
candidates available amounted to 'a very good selection.'
The sale of Costain's Australian coal mining interests has been interrupted
by complex legal proceedings in the US, in turn raising a questionmark over
the group's recent refinancing arrangements which are consequent on the
sale.
Lovell, 38, joined from Conder Group, where he had been chief executive for
five months before the company went into receivership last autumn. He had
been at Plessey between 1980 and 1989, in a series of positions, including
as finance director of Plessey Avionics. In 1985 he was seconded to the
corporate finance department of Kleinwort Benson, working on the defence of
Plessey against the first GEC bid.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Bruce, who quit as head of finance and administration for the London
Stock Exchange shortly after Peter Rawlins arrived as chief executive, has
accepted the same job at an even more troubled City institution, Lloyd's of
London. His appointment represents the final step in a process of
streamlining of senior management initiated by new Lloyd's boss Peter
Middleton.
The head of finance, John Gaynor, took early retirement at the age of 57 at
the end of last year, and the head of administration, Bob Woodford, retires
at the beginning of April at the age of 62 after five and a half years in
the job. The two jobs have now been combined, leaving just four senior
executives - the other three responsible for regulatory services, marketing
services, and systems and operations - reporting to Middleton.
Bruce, 46, moves from Guinness Mahon, where he had been finance director
since 1990. An old Etonian, his first years in the City included spells at
Peat Marwick and Cazenove. He got an early taste of Lloyd's when serving on
the Wilson Committee set up in 1977 to review the City. He says he 'mugged
up' on the market before it was decided that Lloyd's should be studied by a
separate commission.
In 1979 he moved to Royal Dutch Shell, ending up as treasurer and controller
of Shell UK, before moving to the stock exchange in 1986. Passed over as
chief executive, he left shortly afterwards; the finance department was
subsequently thoroughly overhauled. Rawlins, chosen in his stead, resigned
last week over the Taurus fiasco.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Building jails in Pennsylvania
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION INC, a Pittsburgh-based company, has won two
contracts worth Pounds 47m (USDollars 65m) for jails in Pennsylvania.
The largest is a Pounds 40m (USDollars 55m) subcontract to build the main
structure for the new Allegheny County Jail, Pittsburgh.
Work has recently commenced on the building which will be 16 storeys at its
highest point and will contain 1,800 cells. The company must complete the
main structure and cast the cells by the end of this year so that other
subcontractors can begin installing detention systems and mechanical and
electrical works. Four tower cranes will be used to ensure that this
demanding construction programme is met.
Once the main structure has been erected, work will begin on the jail's
brick and curtain wall exterior and finishes to the 975,000 sq ft interior,
including the installation of security ceilings, painted block walls and
epoxy coated floors. Completion is scheduled for 1995.
Work has also commenced on a Pounds 7m (USDollars 10m) contract to construct
a two-storey county jail in Erie. Trafalgar House Construction Inc is
demolishing a building and clearing 17 acres of woodland before carrying out
a cut and fill operation.
The 175,000 sq ft building will contain 200 cells when it is completed at
the end of this year.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Management: A timely tip for manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alistair Frame, a former denizen of boardrooms from RTZ to the old Davy
and now chairman of both British Steel and Wellcome, has an urgent message
for fellow chairmen and chief executives: take some time out from running
your companies.
Sir Alistair, who is chairman of the CBI's 15-month-old National
Manufacturing Council, is not suggesting they should quit their posts en
masse. Rather, he says, they need to find space for thinking about new
ideas.
Whatever the distractions of running their companies in tough conditions,
there should always be time, he says, to learn from the experiences of other
UK companies, and from successful manufacturing companies overseas.
As the first signs of light emerge for recession-bound UK manufacturers, and
the government talks of industry taking advantage of sterling's devaluation
to boost exports, the issue of the UK's manufacturing effectiveness becomes
increasingly important.
The point is not lost on the council, which is perhaps best known for its
role as one of the many organisations lobbying the government on the
importance of providing the right environment for manufacturing industry to
flourish.
That, says Sir Alistair, is going reasonably well, but is one of only four
key tasks that the council has set itself. The others are to improve the
relationship between industry and the financial world, in particular the
City; to improve the image and status of manufacturing industry across
society; and to lobby businesses to improve their competitiveness.
Surprisingly, perhaps, Sir Alistair believes this internal lobbying process
is the most important, focusing as it does on issues such as how industries
can improve their service to customers, marketing, innovation, product
quality and other ingredients of competitiveness.
Getting all these things right is the route to what is commonly called
'world class' manufacturing. But the consensus among observers of the UK
manufacturing scene seems to be that, while all the brightest ideas in
manufacturing can be found in use in the UK, they are not applied nearly
frequently enough.
That was borne out by a survey last month co-sponsored by the Design Council
and EDS-Scicon, the biggest UK information technology services company. This
found that less than half of UK manufacturing companies claim to practise
concurrent engineering, a process which cuts product development times by
enabling design and manufacturing to take place simultaneously.
Clearly, an important way to spread the word about new methods in
manufacturing is for companies to share their experiences.
The evidence suggests larger companies are more confident about doing that
without always worrying that they are giving away commercially sensitive
information. But the council is hoping to attract companies of all sizes to
a series of seminars beginning next month, at which executives from
different companies can learn from each other.
Sir Alistair will also be addressing a conference called Winning the Market
 -Industry on the Move, on April 28 and 29, organised by the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers.
The conference, to be held at a hotel in Hertfordshire, will be similar to
the well-attended Cambridge Manufacturing Forum series in the 1970s. Senior
European industrialists will be examining the importance of understanding
and developing markets, the coherent integration of marketing, design and
manufacturing, and the management of technological advantage and innovation.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Management: What's up for grabs? - A report on new
opportunities for service companies to bid for government contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opportunities to sell business services to a customer with a triple-A credit
rating are rare in the present recession. The UK government's market-testing
programme to put Pounds 1.5bn of civil service work out to tender has
therefore excited widespread interest among service companies in the UK and
abroad.
Two conferences staged by the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit to sell the
programme to business (the most recent on Friday) have each attracted 500
executives to learn more about the work being market-tested and how to bid
for it.
Bidding for government contracts is a well-established part of business for
companies in the defence industry. And service companies in fields such as
office cleaning, catering, security guarding and printing have been winning
contracts from government departments, local authorities and the health
service since the start of the 1980s.
But the government's latest programme of market-testing represents a 50-fold
increase in its contracting-out programme.
For the first time, core civil service activities such as collection of
statistics, management of government computer facilities and fishery
protection surveillance operations are to be put out to tender. And many
more support services are on offer, including payroll, audit, accountancy,
office services and legal advice. Many are advertised in the press;
alternatively, companies can find out what work is available by contacting
government ministries or the Efficiency Unit.
There is also a drive to attract small and medium-sized enterprises into the
market, since ministers are keen to stimulate competition for contracts.
According to the Efficiency Unit, more than 300 of the 350 contracts on
offer in this first round of market-testing involve fewer than 200 jobs  -
and 83 currently employ less than 10 people.
Executives attending the Efficiency Unit conferences have been keen to know
more about what would be expected of them and if previous experience in
contracting for government will be necessary.
According to Ian Williams of the Efficiency Unit, those in charge of
awarding contracts will be looking for reliability, quality of staff and a
track record in providing the sort of services out to tender.
Competing bids will be judged on three sets of criteria:
Capability - has the bidder the people and skills to do the job? Particular
attention will be paid to the management and supervisory back-up to be
provided.
Technical assessment - whether the bid meets the requirements set out in the
specification. BS5750 - a quality management standard - will not generally
be a requirement.
Financial standing - the robustness of the bid given the commercial and
financial strength of the company.
A common concern among potential bidders is that there will be an element of
bias towards the in-house team, which will normally be competing to retain
the work. Sir Peter Levene, the government's efficiency adviser, says great
efforts have been made to ensure there will be 'fair and open competition'
for contracts.
Those responsible for drawing up contract specifications and evaluating bids
will be separated by 'Chinese walls' from the staff currently doing the
work. New costing guidance has been drawn up to ensure that in-house bids
fully reflect overheads and start-up costs.
The responsibility for ensuring fair play will ultimately lie with the
National Audit Office, the government expenditure watchdog, Sir Peter says.
Another concern is whether contract specifications will be too rigid to
permit contractors to develop new and more flexible approaches to doing the
work. 'Bidders will be encouraged to offer innovative or novel proposals,'
according to Ian Williams. 'The successful bidder's proposal, as modified
during discussions, will form part of the contract document.'
Winning the business will not be the end of the process, however. Extensive
arrangements will be put in place to check quality standards and monitor
services - including random checks, regular inspections and audit of
complaints.
A second round of market-testing will be launched by the Efficiency Unit in
the autumn, with at least a further Pounds 1bn of business put out to
tender.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Management: Tupe or not Tupe. . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could it be the Thatcherite nightmare is coming true? That British
legislation to promote the free market in the UK, namely Compulsory
Competitive Tendering in local and central government, is being thwarted by
European legislation to protect the rights of workers, namely the transfer
of undertakings regulations?
The UK's transfer regulations, known as Tupe, stem from the EC's 1977
Acquired Rights Directive which was designed to protect some employee rights
when businesses or undertakings are transferred from one employer to
another. The government insists Tupe will rarely apply to contracting-out,
while trade unions and many lawyers insist it will invariably apply - making
it harder for private business to make money on government contracts by
cutting the wages bill. Private contractors want clarification on their
potential liabilities before tendering.
The government has been lobbying hard in Brussels for the directive to be
revised to exclude contracting-out. But the UK is unlikely to get what it
wants unless the unions abuse the leverage Tupe seems to give them or unless
a wave of retrospective Tupe claims are unleashed.
There are two important questions about Tupe: what do the regulations
require and when do they apply? Both questions are difficult to answer
definitively.
The regulations insist staff cannot be dismissed as the result of a
transfer, although it may be possible to dismiss people soon after for other
reasons. The regulations also insist terms and conditions of employment
cannot be changed without consent and collective deals and union recognition
must be carried over.
There is less clarity about two further things - whether pension terms can
be altered and how long the previous employment conditions must be
maintained. The Acquired Rights Directive specified a period of one year but
that was not mentioned in the UK's Tupe regulations.
When the regulations apply depends on the definition of a 'transfer' and an
'undertaking'. To take two extremes, the regulations would normally apply if
a contractor was employing substantially the same staff as before on the
same premises with the same equipment. The regulations would not normally
apply if the contractor employs none of the existing staff and conducts his
operation at different premises with his own equipment.
Recent judgments at the European Court of Justice suggest EC judges favour a
broad definition of both a transfer and an undertaking which would capture a
broad range of the services currently being prepared for contracting-out. It
is even possible to be caught when a council or government department
terminates its existing service and buys in a new service.
In general terms manual worker operations are more likely to be caught by
Tupe than white collar administrative functions. That is unfortunate for
contractors as manual operations are usually easier to save money on through
job cuts and wages are usually more generous than the private sector.
What are the solutions? Contractor lobby groups believe Tupe will have a
greater effect than the government has admitted.
But the lobbyists believe that even without legal clarity there are things
that could be done. Departments could slim down and reorganise prior to
contracting out, although that might still transgress the regulations and
seems unpopular with the government. The government could indemnify
companies against Tupe-imposed costs or extend contract periods to make it
easier for companies to recoup the extra costs.
Alternatively public authorities should be required to make a 'realistic'
return on capital on services such as cleaning. The current requirement for
cleaning is 5 per cent which allows them to pay wages on average 10 per cent
above the private sector.
But according to John Hall of the Cleaning and Support Services Association
the preferred, but not foolproof, method of Tupe avoidance for companies
will be the refusal to take on existing staff unless they agree to changes
in their terms and conditions.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Economics: Focus turns to UK Budget outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE have been few clues as to what tomorrow's Budget will deliver in the
UK. But with the public sector borrowing requirement set to rise to between
Pounds 45bn and Pounds 50bn in the next financial year, the chancellor is
expected to announce some revenue raising measures.
An alteration to the VAT system is one possibility. The chancellor has the
option of either raising the rate of VAT - currently 17.5 per cent  - or
extending its base to include items such as food, newspapers and children's
clothes.
One drawback would be the upwards pressure such a move would put on the
retail prices index. But as the RPI figures at the end of this week are
expected to show, the government still has plenty of room on inflation.
The rest of the week will be taken up with other UK figures, including
manufacturing output, unemployment figures and the February PSBR.
Other economic highlights of the week follow. The figures in brackets are
the consensus of economists forecasts from MMS International, a financial

1-10.
Tomorrow: UK, Budget statement, February PSBR (Pounds 4.5bn); US, February
housing starts (1.25m), February building permits, Q4 current account,
Johnson Redbook week ended March 13; Canada, January manufacturing orders
(up 1 per cent on month), January manufacturing shipments (up 0.5 per cent
on month); Japan, February trade balance (Dollars 11.9bn).

February Treasury Budget.
During the week: Germany, January retail sales, February WPI (up 0.3 per
cent on month), February PPI (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 0.7 per cent on
year), February M3 (flat); Spain, January CPI (up 5 per cent on year);
Netherlands, February CPI (up 0.3 per cent on month, up 2.4 per cent on
year), January trade balance; Italy, January PPI (up 2.5 per cent on year),
January WPI (up 4.4 per cent on year), January industrial production (down

FT  15 MAR 93 / Gloom recedes on job prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS are more optimistic about job prospects for the second quarter of
this year, Manpower, the employment services group, says.
In its survey of employment prospects published today Manpower says there
are signs of an improvement in manufacturing, but warns of pointers to a
sharp fall in public-sector employment during the next three months.
While 17 per cent of employers covered by the survey forecast increased
staffing, 18 per cent believe there will be further job losses - a balance
of 1 per cent expecting staff cuts. However, this represents a clear
improvement on the balance of 16 per cent expecting cuts in the first
quarter of this year and the balance of 2 per cent expecting a decrease in
staffing for the second quarter last year.
Manufacturers were more optimistic this year than at the same time last
year, with a balance of 5 per cent expecting more jobs against 2 per cent
for the second quarter of 1992.
Ms Lilian Bennet at Manpower said: 'There are, encouragingly, some positive
indicators in the results. This is endorsed by our experience in the
marketplace where employers are using more temporary staff while assessing
the strength of recovery and to give themselves greater flexibility.'
The survey reports an improvement in job prospects in the electrical and
electronic engineering industry, with a balance of 9 per cent of employers
expecting to increase their workforces against only 2 per cent for the same
period last year.
However, prospects in the public sector have grown bleaker. Manpower says
that 29 per cent of public-sector employers forecast job losses, while 9 per
cent expect an increase, giving a balance of 20 per cent expecting a decline
in staff numbers. In the same period last year a balance of 11 per cent
expected cuts.
On a regional breakdown, employers in only three areas forecast
improvements. A balance of 8 per cent of Scottish employers expect to
increase their workforces, against balances of 5 per cent in the west of
England and 5 per cent in Yorkshire and Humberside. All other regions
expect, on balance, that job numbers will fall.
Manpower's survey is based on contacts with 1,941 companies during February.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Lords set to attack union fee proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government to modify its plans to change the check-off
arrangements through which trade union subscriptions are deducted
automatically from employees' pay will intensify this week.
Tomorrow the House of Lords will have its first chance to amend the
government's union reform legislation.
Under proposals outlined in the bill, employees would have to indicate their
continuing approval of the arrangement every three years. At present there
is no obligation to indicate approval.
Both Labour and Tory peers have put down changes to the government's
proposal, reflecting disquiet about the move from unions and employers
alike.
The point was the one on which the government came closest to making a
concession when the bill was discussed by MPs.
Many at Westminster believe it will not survive unchanged during the
line-by-line consideration of the bill in the Lords which starts tomorrow
and continues over the next few weeks.
Ministers are determined not to shift on the point of principle that
approval of check-off arrangements by employees would have to be renewed,
but they may be forced to make renewal last for longer than three years.
Another point that has concerned employers is the proposed greater freedom
for individuals to choose the union they join. The government believes it
can defuse criticism over the move by underlining that the measure would not
affect single-union deals because the law would not introduce new
requirements about recognition of unions.
Cross-party alliances among peers on aspects of the maternity provisions
will also test the government's handling of the legislation.
This new set of likely difficulties for ministers in the Lords comes as the
government still faces disquiet from Tory peers over its plans for property
leasehold laws.
Discussion of the Housing Bill resumes in the House of Lords today. But over
the leasehold reform provisions the government can rely on support from
Labour and Liberal Democrats to save it from defeat by Tory rebels who want
to restrict the new rights for long-leaseholders.
The common ground on some issues between employers and unions over the
planned union reforms is a much more serious threat to the Conservative
majority in the Lords.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Industrial chiefs lead skills drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUSINESS-LED advisory council to bring fresh impetus to transforming the
skills of the workforce and to speed up the introduction of National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), will be announced by the government today.
The National Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets (Nacett)
will be chaired by Mr Peter Davis, deputy chairman and chief executive of
Reed Elsevier, the magazine publisher. Other members include Mr Dominic
Cadbury, chief executive of Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft
drinks manufacturer, and Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering
and electrical union.
Five years ago the government authorised NVQs to help improve Britain's poor
skills record, but implementation has been slow. Based on an individual's
ability to do a task, NVQs stretch from level one (semi-skilled) to level
five (higher professional), and provide comparability between different
occupations and between vocational and academic qualifications.
The Confederation of British Industry last year led an initiative to set
national targets for take-up of NVQs. By 1997 80 per cent of young people
should have achieved NVQ2 or its academic equivalent. The figure now is
about 50 per cent.
The government endorses these targets but has fought shy of giving them full
backing. The establishment of Nacett, with a parallel body in Scotland,
indicates that it is becoming more involved.
Most employers pay only lip service to NVQs. Reasons for this include:
The Department of Employment has done little promotion.
Many employers have feared that the government would abandon the reform.
NVQs can be expensive, with accreditation fees in addition to extra training
costs. To introduce them for the 30,000 weekly paid staff of J. Sainsbury,
the retailer, would cost Pounds 3.2m on certification alone.
Some employers argue that NVQs are too broad, others that they are too
narrow. Critics say standards will vary because assessment is done in-house.
Some employers fear that workers might demand more pay for attaining NVQs.
Acquisition of the new Investors in People quality standard for in-company
training and development is not dependent on a company training to NVQ
standards.
Nacett will monitor progress towards the targets, publish an annual report,
and advise the government. The council will report to the secretaries of
state for education, employment, and Wales. It replaces the National
Training Task Force, which was also made up of business leaders.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Boycott threatens school rankings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS' boycotts could make it impossible to carry out testing in schools
as part of implementing the national curriculum, Mr John Patten, education
secretary, has been warned.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the NAHT, the largest union representing
headteachers, has warned Mr Patten in a letter that industrial action
against tests threatens the compilation of school performance league tables.
On Friday the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union, instructed its
members to boycott assessment and testing associated with the government's
national curriculum. The NUT, the largest teaching union, will ballot its
members in May over plans to boycott just the English tests for
14-year-olds.
Mr Hart said that headteachers could not always be expected to administer
the tests if the boycotts occurred.
A boycott would be the first industrial action by teachers over a
professional issue, he said, and heads may be unwilling to instruct other
teachers to do the work.
In some cases heads may have to cancel tests in one or more subjects, Mr
Hart said, if boycotts meant that the results would not 'properly reflect
the performance of the school'.
He added: 'This means that the results would not be reported to parents,
governors or local education authorities and they would not be forwarded for
national collation or publication. A head cannot be expected to insist upon
testing taking place where the extent of industrial action would lead to a
flawed picture.'
The test results are used in compiling school performance league tables, a
central plank of the government's education policy. The government's scope
to compel heads to administer tests appears to be limited, according to Mr
Hart.
Teachers could do more to use test results to plan their work, according to
the Ofsted, the schools inspectorate.
Reviewing progress in implementing the national curriculum, the inspectors
say that the results are often ignored by teachers in planning school work.
Ofsted says pupils' strengths and weaknesses as revealed in tests should be
used to prepare work which reflects their differing abilities.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Fears grow for charities as cash crisis worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARITIES are stretched to their financial limits and face a growing funding
crisis, says a survey published today.
The Top 1,000 charities guide published by Hemmington Scott is the first
attempt to compare financial information across so many voluntary
organisations. It shows that most are struggling to match expenditure by
income.
Expenditure was found to be growing faster than income, with 97 per cent of
income spent in the most recent financial year compared with 95 per cent in
the previous year. Net asset cover dropped sharply.
Total assets of the charities are more than Pounds 20bn. But most charities
cannot rely on assets for future income - most assets are concentrated in a
few charities.
The study includes 1,365 charities that are ranked in the top 1,000 by one
or more of the categories of income, expenditure or assets. It is based on
the most recent annual reports.
The wealthiest charity, the Wellcome Trust, has Pounds 5.1bn in funds, while
the top five alone account for nearly half of all the assets held by the
leading 1,000.
'There are tremendous demands on charities which are not going to be met by
increased income,' said Mr Peter Scott, the guide's compiler. 'They have
stretched things as far as they can. There is going to be a real problem.'
Auditors to eight of the charities expressed doubts in the accounts about
their continued survival, including the London Zoological Society, the Royal
Opera House at Covent Garden, and the Aldeburgh Foundation music charity.
The highest contribution of money or resources to charities among quoted
companies came from BP, with Pounds 28.1m, followed by British
Telecommunications, British Gas and National Westminster Bank. More than 670
quoted companies gave no money in their most recent financial year.
The survey revalued assets shown in charities' accounts by Pounds 7.7bn to
bring them into line with market prices. That is still a substantial
under-estimate because many values cannot be readily determined.
A quarter of the top 1,000 charities derived some income from trading
operations, but 21 made a loss on these activities, including the British
Red Cross Society and the Marie Curie Foundation.
Oxfam spent more than any other charity on publicity and fundraising -
Pounds 12m in 1992 - followed by Barnado's, Save the Children Fund and Help
the Aged. Average spending on fundraising was 10 per cent of voluntary
income generated.
Mr Scott stressed that most charities were efficiently run.
The analysis highlighted a tremendous diversity of accounting practices. For
example, many charities put figures in their reserves rather than showing
them in the profit and loss account.
That is an issue which will be addressed on Thursday when the Charity
Commission publishes a new draft statement on accounting practice.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Leaked report embarrasses Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, yesterday found himself
trying to contain the political fall-out from a leaked report written by his
department that shows a depressing outlook for manufacturing industry.
The confidential report, prepared as a background paper for Mr Heseltine by
the DTI's industrial competitiveness unit, was leaked to The Sunday Times
newspaper.
The report underlines the structural problems faced by industry and the
uphill struggle needed to bring about an export-led recovery. The paper
concludes that UK industry is beset by weak management and products and
underinvestment in new technology.
Mr Heseltine, speaking on BBC radio yesterday, appeared to play down the
accuracy of the report while at the same time confirming its authenticity
and partially agreeing with some of its conclusions.
'Of course it is a leak and it gives a very superficial impression,' he
said.
Mr Heseltine defended the government's record over the past 10 years in the
creation of small businesses, privatisation and industrial relations.
But asked whether he agreed with the report's main findings that Britain's
product base was weak and deteriorating and that any adjustment would take
many years, Mr Heseltine said: 'I do accept that.' He added: 'This is a
long-term process and this is what makes it so difficult in PR terms.'
Earlier Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, called on the
government to publish the leaked report in full.
He told the party's Scottish conference: 'There are now only 4.5m people
working in manufacturing industry in Britain. If present trends continue
this government will achieve a new economic first . . . we will have fewer
people at work making things than we will have really out of work making
nothing.'
During his interview Mr Heseltine would not be drawn on whether the
government would publish the full report.
He said: 'If we feel there is a case for making aspects of it available we
will. But we are not simply prepared to provide a propaganda exercise for
our international competitors to pick up bits and pieces and say 'look, the
British themselves feel this is not their strongest point'.'

FT  15 MAR 93 / Two options for Channel tunnel rail link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is days away from announcing two possible routes to central
London for the planned high-speed rail line linking the capital with the
Channel tunnel.
It is also expected to announce in the Budget tomorrow that the Pounds 2.5bn
project will be a candidate for joint financing by the public and private
sectors under new guidelines drawn up by the Treasury.
The more controversial approach to central London would follow the route of
British Rail's North London Line from Stratford to Dalston Kingsland in east
London but run under the track in a tunnel. It would then surface to join
the existing four-track North London Line through Canonbury, Islington and
Barnsbury.
After passing through Caledonian Road and Barnsbury station, trains would
run south at a new junction and run into St Pancras station, where there is
said to be enough room for an international terminal.
The less controversial alternative route would go through a tunnel all the
way from Stratford, ending at a new underground terminal beneath King's
Cross station, which is next to St Pancras.
The government has been forced to publish two alternative proposals because
of a behind-the-scenes row over where the London terminus should be.
Union Railways, the BR subsidiary in charge of the project, favours the St
Pancras option because it is much cheaper than the King's Cross one. It
fears that a more expensive project will not go ahead.
British Railways Board, however, is fighting to preserve the King's Cross
option because construction of an underground terminal forms part of its
ambitious plans for a Pounds 1.4bn upgrade of the InterCity and suburban
railway interchange at the station.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is believed to favour the Union
Railways plan, but British Railways Board has refused to abandon its
position. Rather than continue the argument, Mr MacGregor has decided to put
both options to public consultation.
The Union Railways option is likely to worry north London residents near the
overground sections of the route because the link will carry high-speed
commuter trains from Kent into central London as well as trains running
between London, Paris and Brussels.
Union Railways believes the line could be open by 2000 provided legislation
is introduced this autumn and the funds are available.
The government had hoped that the private sector would finance the scheme
using revenues from train operators and property profits from the
development of adjacent land. However, the depressed state of the property
market means a contribution from the public sector is likely to be needed if
the project is to go ahead.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Days off sick cost employers Pounds 13bn a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABSENTEEISM because of sickness is costing employers Pounds 13bn a year,
says a survey published today by the Confederation of British Industry.
The survey shows that the average worker is absent from work for eight days
in the year because of sick-ness.
Workers in the National Health Service and local government took the most
time off. In those two sectors absenteeism was 41 per cent higher than the
national average.
Percom, the personnel software company that carried out the survey,
suggested that the result may have been caused by private companies
monitoring and controlling absence from work more effectively than the
public sector.
The differences in absenteeism could also be related to the composition of
work forces, with the public sector employing large numbers of blue-collar
workers.
According to the survey, full-time blue-collar workers in both manufacturing
and service sectors had almost double the level of absenteeism of
white-collar workers.
However, absence rates through sickness are falling. Mr Robbie Gilbert, the
CBI's director of employment, said: 'Sickness absence overall fell sharply
last year by almost 0.5 per cent of working time from the 1991 figure of 4
per cent. This compares with the 1987 figure of 3.6 per cent, which rose to
3.9 per cent for both 1989 and 1990.'
Most companies used computers to keep track of staff absences, with 94 per
cent having notification procedures; 83 per cent enforced disciplinary
procedures; and 82 per cent operated recruitment checks to eliminate
work-shy candidates.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Scottish attack on economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE QUARTERS of Scotland's top companies believe the government has no
effective economic policy, a poll commissioned by accountancy firm Pannell
Kerr Forster and BBC Scotland has found. The same proportion believe Mr
Norman Lamont should not continue as chancellor.
Half of the chief executives polled were optimistic about their companies'
prospects, while only 35 per cent voiced concern.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Customs climbdown over curb to VAT concession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise has backed down over its plans to restrict from next
month the value added tax that holding companies can reclaim.
The decision to defer the move follows intensive lobbying by business and
professional groups, and could cost the Treasury up to Pounds 100m in lost
revenues.
Customs is expected to announce today that it will delay implementation of
its policy at least until October 1 to allow further consultation.
It is still unclear whether it will modify the policy or use the extra time
to allow companies to prepare for the change.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, approved the delay on Friday.
Customs originally issued a statement last October declaring that holding
companies owning operating subsidiaries would no longer be entitled to
recover VAT incurred on their 'basic business activities' such as
professionals' fees.
It was based on an interpretation of the implications of a ruling by the
European Court of Justice on a holding company called Polysar.
After strong opposition caused by concern over the costs and the speed of
implementation, it initially deferred the starting date until April.
Pressure came from groups including the Confederation of British Industry,
and legal action was threatened by a consortium of businesses led by
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Mr John Arnold, a tax partner with Coopers,
said: 'This is a victory for British business and shows that Customs
listens.'

FT  15 MAR 93 / Farmers fearful of a ministerial sea change: Coastline
policy that could lead to loss of land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE tides which threatened coastal fields this week added to a concern which
will not recede so quickly.
Some farmers fear their land could be abandoned to the sea following a
review by the Ministry of Agriculture which called for a more
'environmental' policy to protect the coastline. At stake are the sea walls
and other shore defences which protect more than 1,250km of the coast -
mostly around East Anglia, which is particularly vulnerable to flooding as
the coastline is gradually sinking into the sea.
More than 1,000km of these defences are maintained by the National Rivers
Authority or local authorities, with financial support from the Ministry of
Agriculture. In Essex alone, 36,053 acres of low-lying farmland are
protected in this way.
But a statement by Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, that 'in some
areas setting back the line of defence might be the most effective coastal
defence option' suggests the ministry may abandon some of the more isolated
 -and expensive - stretches of sea wall.
The ministry insists that the proposal stems from a desire for a more
'environmentally sensitive' policy, using natural defences instead of walls
and buffers, and operating programmes of 'managed retreat'. An experiment of
letting farmland revert to salt marshes is under way in Essex.
'We are looking at each area on a case-by-case basis,' the ministry said. It
insisted that most farmland and all residential areas would be protected.
In the 1992-93 financial year the rivers authority spent Pounds 250m on
flood defences - Pounds 20m more than the previous year. Some small sea
defences cost more to maintain than the land behind them was worth.
Mr Mark Dixon, an environmental specialist at the authority, said: 'This is
not perceived to be good value for the taxpayer.' He pointed out that in
part of East Anglia about Pounds 650 a year was spent protecting each acre
of farmland - almost a third of the value of the land.
The proposals have been welcomed by environmentalists, but have provoked an
angry response from farmers.
Mr Brian McLaughlin, head of the National Farmers' Union land use
department, said: 'We are not wanting to adopt a 'King Canute' approach but
we do not think the government's proposals have been adequately researched.'
The union is demanding compensation for farmers if sea defences are
abandoned.
Mr McLaughlin said that if a field was flooded, neighbouring land was also
affected by salt. He added: 'If you remove protection for land you undermine
the value of the farmers' main asset in the eyes of the bank.'

FT  15 MAR 93 / Truck and van sales fall 7.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGISTRATIONS of new commercial vehicles fell by 7.49 per cent last month,
compared with February last year, figures from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders show.
The rapid plunge of Leyland Daf from leadership of the truck market in the
wake of its collapse is also highlighted. Its rivals, led by Iveco Ford,
have moved swiftly to capitalise on the market opportunities presented by
the halt in Leyland Daf truck and van production last month.
The receivers have restored production at both the Leyland truck plant and
the Birmingham van plant, with separate management buy-outs of each now
under discussion. However, the collapse meant that last month Leyland Daf's
truck sales fell by more than a third, to 373 from 584 in February last
year.
The Fiat-controlled Iveco group, which includes Iveco Ford, small UK
truckmaker Seddon Atkinson and imports of Iveco-built trucks from the
continent, saw its truck registrations leap last month by 54.7 per cent to
874 against February last year. Sharp rises were also recorded by Mercedes,
up 20 per cent, Volvo (23 per cent) and Scania (20 per cent). The
intensified market struggle has, however, left ERF, the UK's last publicly
quoted independent heavy truckmaker, caught in the crossfire. Its
registrations were down by a third to 65.
In spite of the big changes in individual company sales, total sales of
trucks - vehicles of 3.5 tonnes and over - were only 3.7 per cent higher
last month at 2,585. This gives substance to concern about a
slower-than-hoped recovery from the worst commercial vehicle recession since
the second world war.
Indeed, registrations of heavy trucks over 15 tonnes - the mainstay of the
UK's haulage industry and a good barometer of economic activity - are
running so far this year at nearly 2 per cent below the levels of a year
ago.
The contrast between the 7.5 per cent drop in total commercial vehicles
registrations, to 15,085 from 16,307 in February last year, and the 16 per
cent rise in car registrations is a sharp one. However, some industry
analysts believe that around six percentage points of the car rise may be
accounted for by dealers or manufacturers registering cars for which there
are, as yet, no final buyers in an effort to boost apparent market share and
to keep assembly lines busy.

FT  15 MAR 93 / BBC management board backs Birt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR managers at the BBC today rally to the defence of Mr John Birt, the
director-general at the centre of a row about his tax arrangements, saying
he has their 'unanimous support'.
In a letter to The Times newspaper today, the 10 members of the BBC's board
of management, responsible for the day-to-day running of the corporation,
say the controversy surrounding Mr Birt has obscured the most important
issue in broadcasting - the need for the BBC to have a clear vision in order
to safeguard its future after its charter expires in 1996.
'In January John Birt laid out that vision of a wide range of high-quality
programmes, greater efficiency and accountability with value for money for
licence payers,' the letter says.
The letter adds: 'We . . . believe that John Birt is the best person to lead
the BBC and he has our unanimous support.'
The letter may strengthen Mr Birt's position ahead of Thursday's meeting of
the BBC'S 12-strong board of governors which is expected to hear calls for
his resignation.
Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of network television, yesterday admitted
in a BBC radio interview that both Mr Birt and the corporation had been
damaged by the revelation that he had been paid through a private company,
John Birt Productions. But Mr Wyatt insisted that Mr Birt should not lose
his job.
'He's clearly been damaged by it, John knows he's been damaged by it and . .
. he'll need the help of his colleagues, which he will get, to get over it.
But we believe it is get-overable.'
Mr Wyatt said he did not believe there was a conspiracy against Mr Birt, but
suggested that 'factions who would like to stop change in the BBC' might be
under the impression they could do so by destabil-ising the
director-general.
Mr Wyatt's comments followed calls by several Sunday newspapers for the
resignation of Mr Birt, and of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman who
approved his financial arrangements.
Mr Hussey last week vigorously defended Mr Birt. It later emerged that
several BBC governors had not given their support to his statement, and some
had not known of the director-general's status as a freelance consultant.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Buy-out plans for two Daf operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT buy-out proposals are being prepared for two further operations
within Leyland Daf, the truck and van maker in administrative receivership.
Mr Arthur Zammit, managing director of Daf International, based at Eindhoven
in the Netherlands, is leading a UK-based team seeking to take control of
Leyland Daf's truck assembly and distribution activities in Zimbabwe,
Zambia, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi.
Managers at Leyland Daf's parts distribution operations at Chorley,
Lancashire, are also understood to have begun talks with the receivers on a
possible buy-out.
Meanwhile the management team seeking to buy Leyland Daf's vans operation in
Birmingham has acquired a non-executive chairman-designate. He is Mr Ned
Dawnay, a director of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, which is 50 per cent
owned by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Mr Dawnay, a former
non-executive director of Rover Group, is understood to have been introduced
by former Rover chairman Sir Graham Day.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Inland Revenue seeks adjudicator for complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue has begun its search for candidates for the post of
independent revenue adjudicator to deal with complaints from taxpayers.
Job advertisements placed in national newspapers last Saturday said the job
would pay Pounds 55,000 a year pro rata, with an initial estimate that the
time required would be 20 hours per week.
The candidate will be expected to have extensive business experience or
involvement in managing a large organisation, but need not have any
background in tax issues.
The adjudicator's position was announced last month as part of the
department's contribution to the government's Citizen's Charter initiative.
The Revenue hopes to have an adjudicator in place by May to deal with
complaints from the beginning of the new tax year.
The job will investigate complaints about the way the Revenue has handled
tax affairs, such as excessive delays, errors, discourtesy or the way in
which discretion is exercised. It expects to deal with 20 to 50 complaints a
week.
There will be a small team of seconded Revenue staff initially to help the
adjudicator.
The Revenue said it had no plans to appoint a headhunter to help in the
search for candidates.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Bombay stays calm in the face of horror: The city seems
determined to put Friday's outrage behind it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay
stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken
concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255
people killed and over 1,200 injured.
'I'm lucky to be alive,' he said from his hospital bed. 'Who did this? Who
can stop this happening again?'
Across Bombay people were asking themselves the same questions this weekend.
They sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred
the city in December and again in January. Those were caused by a
traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem
hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya. The weapons
used were mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles.
Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology
terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers,
efficient organisation and money.
The only comparable previous incident was the assassination in 1991 of Mr
Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger
terrorists.
But that was a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosions in Bombay were
designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital. Bombay accounts for
35 per cent of India's exports. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister,
described the blasts as an attack on India's economy.
The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of
Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign
help.
But these suggestions were seen in Bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect
attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects -
Moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit India
after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including
700 in Bombay.
If Moslems are found to have staged the attacks, the Indian authorities will
certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a Moslem country,
notably Pakistan.
The implications would be vast. Breaking diplomatic relations would be the
minimum step Delhi could take on a dangerous road.
Mr Rao chose his words carefully during his visit to Bombay: 'There is a
definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country. I do
not want to name anybody because it will have ramifications within and
outside the country.'
There is no evidence linking the attacks to Moslem extremists, let alone to
Pakistan. Even if Moslem groups are found to be responsible for the
bombings, they could have been supplied from other Moslem countries. India
would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale.
For the moment, such concerns seem remote from the streets on Bombay, where
the atmosphere yesterday was calm. Workmen were clearing away rubble at the
blast sites, including the blackened stock exchange building.
Bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them. At the Gymkhana
Club and dozens of other sports grounds, hundreds of men and boys were
playing cricket as they do every Sunday. Others were walking along the
seafront by the arch of the Gateway of India.
The stock exchange authorities plan to re-start trading as soon as they can
 -probably today - using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last
year.
Businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life
and injuries and the damage caused to blasted buildings.
They did not expect the same widespread disruption to production as occurred
during the riots.
Some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and
the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troops to help
patrol sensitive districts. But much more should go to the people of Bombay,
who, so far at least, have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the
bombers.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Victorious Keating begins big reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, yesterday began work on a
wide-ranging ministerial reshuffle after unexpectedly retaining power in
Saturday's federal election.
With five seats still in doubt late last night, Labor was expected to win an
overall majority of at least seven seats in the 147-seat House of
Representatives. It had a majority of six in the last parliament.
The victory gives Mr Keating substantial freedom to introduce fresh faces
into the ministerial team he inherited after defeating Mr Bob Hawke, the
former prime minister, in a 1991 leadership battle.
Mr Bob Hogg, Labor's national secretary, said there was likely to be 'a fair
turnover' in the cabinet. However, Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance
minister), is expected to retain his post.
The government also signalled during the campaign that it would approve a
cut in interest rates soon, unless the Australian dollar failed to maintain
its recent recovery.
Mr Dawkins forecast yesterday that economic growth would accelerate from 2.4
per cent to 3-4 per cent by the end of the year, helped by recovery in other
developed countries.
Labor's victory followed a late surge of support, not identified by
published opinion polls until election day. Labor's private polling also
failed to identify the swing.
The main factor was Mr Keating's attacks on the coalition's plans for
radical reform of industrial relations and tax, including the introduction
of a goods and services tax.
The result was a triumph for Mr Keating, who was one of only a handful of
Labor leaders who believed Labor could win in spite of high unemployment and
slow economic growth.
'This is the sweetest victory in the world. This is a victory for the true
believers; the people who in difficult times kept the faith,' he told
supporters at his Sydney headquarters.
Mr John Hewson, the Liberal/ National party coalition leader, announced a
review of opposition policies and forecast that the GST plan would be
dropped. He said he was sure of 'strong support' in a leadership election to
be held shortly.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Australian hero sheds villain image: Keating has broken
shackles of Labor's mistakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S re-elected Labor prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, must feel a
little like Superman. For 15 months, since he took over from Mr Bob Hawke,
Mr Keating has been shackled by past mistakes. On Saturday, with one bound,
he was free.
As treasurer (finance minister) until March 1991, Mr Keating was one of the
most unpopular politicians in the country, widely blamed for triggering the
1990-91 recession through mistaken handling of monetary policy.
His image nosedived further after he successfully challenged in December
1991 for the Labor leadership, bringing a premature end to the career of Mr
Hawke, Labor's longest serving and most popular leader.
Mr Keating has spent much of his time since then trying to refashion his
image by airing a diverse range of emotive issues designed to show that his
vision for Australia embraces more than effective economic management.
In the process he has wooed Aborigines with promises of reconciliation with
white Australia, nationalists with promises of republicanism and a new flag,
and parents with a campaign against television violence.
He has also cleaned up his language, largely eschewing colourful phrases
such as 'scumbag' which were well-received by parliamentary colleagues, but
notoriously unpopular with voters.
He has been unable, however, to do anything about the level of unemployment,
which rose to 11.1 per cent of the workforce or more than 1m people during
the campaign.
Until late on Saturday night, there was almost unanimous agreement among
opinion pollsters and commentators that the government's economic record
would hand a narrow victory to the opposition Liberal/National Party
coalition.
But neither the opinion polls nor the pundits had picked up a late swing to
Labor as voters heeded repeated warnings by Mr Keating that the opposition's
radical taxation and industrial relations policies would lead to chaos.
Much of his campaign was based on the dubious claim that the coalition's
proposals for a goods and services tax (GST), similar to the European value
added tax, would cause an irreversible change in the Australian way of life.
Mr Keating also scored a significant victory in the last two days of the
campaign with an attack on the coalition's plan to deregulate the labour
market, which he claimed would open workers to exploitation.
When all the votes are counted, Labor seems likely to achieve a majority of
between seven and 17 seats in the 147-seat House of Representatives,
compared with six in the last parliament.
Even the bottom end of the range would represent a startling victory against
the odds, especially as Labor appears likely to become the first government
since 1966 to increase its vote at a general election.
For the coalition, the result is a disaster comparable to the British Labour
party's failure to wrest power from the Conservative government in last
year's UK election.
Mr John Hewson, leader of the Liberals, the coalition's dominant partner,
said he would fight on.
However he said the coalition would drop the GST proposal and establish a
wide-ranging policy review, suggesting that the conservatives may take some
time to recover their direction.
For Mr Keating, the election was the final act in a two-year transformation
from villain to hero. His victory gives Labor a fifth successive term in
government and suggests that the party is close to achieving Mr Hawke's
vision of it as the natural party of government.
At the least, Mr Keating has far exceeded the expectations of Labor MPs, who
made him leader in the hope that he would contain the scale of what most saw
as inevitable defeat.
The signs are that Mr Keating intends to take full advantage of the
circumstances of his victory, which could make him an unusually powerful
Labor prime minister.
The new government's priorities will be to encourage economic recovery and
complete the wide-ranging structural reforms begun under Mr Hawke, such as
the tariff reduction programme.

FT  15 MAR 93 / LDP godfather on income tax evasion charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE politicians were wondering last night who would be next to be
investigated for tax evasion after Mr Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced godfather
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was charged with evading Y118m
(Pounds 690,000) in income taxes.
The prosecutors' pursuit of Mr Kanemaru follows public complaints that they
treated him with undue lenience for an earlier violation of the Political
Funds Contral Law, and there were calls yesterday for an investigation into
the finances of other leading politicians.
Mr Kanemaru, 78, faces further charges, as the Y118m arises from fiscal 1987
and it is believed that prosecutors intend to take action against him for
alleged evasion in each year up until last year.
Prosecutors also charged Mr Masahisa Haibara, 49, Mr Kanemaru's former aide,
with evading Y26m in income tax on undeclared income of at least Y50m in
1987. Mr Haibara also faces further charges, as the first indictments were
rushed through to beat a deadline set by the statute of limitations.
The indictments follow raids on Mr Kanemaru's home and office which
uncovered cash, debenture certificates and gold bullion worth almost Y7bn,
apparently used to maintain his influence as the head of the LDP's largest
faction. He faces a maximum of five years' imprisonment and a Y5m fine.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said that the indictments are 'truly
regrettable', as 'public distrust for politics is worsening due to
consecutive scandals.'
But the LDP is still divided over reforms to political funding legislation,
in particular a suggested ban on donations to the support groups which
bankroll most politicians.
Most party members apparently agree that there should be tougher controls on
funds received by individuals but are reluctant to agree a ban on the
funding of these support groups.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Korea central bank gets new governor

SOUTH KOREA'S new government has completed its appointment of senior
economic officials by naming a new central bank governor.
Mr Kim Myung-ko, the head of the central bank's Office of Bank Supervision,
will replace Mr Cho Soon, who was forced to resign at the weekend after
serving only a year of his four-year term as the Bank of Korea governor.
Mr Cho repeatedly challenged the government last year, which probably
contributed to his departure. He is a strong advocate of financial
liberalisation and greater autonomy for the BOK.
His removal reflects the central bank's lack of independence from political
interference. The BOK staff held a protest meeting after Mr Cho's
resignation was announced.
His main achievement at the BOK was to persuade the government to adopt a
tight monetary policy to cool the overheated economy. Inflation slowed to
4.5 per cent last year from 9.3 per cent in 1991.
But he was criticised by business for causing an economic slowdown, leading
to a record number of bankruptcies and falling profits.
When the government recently decided to revive growth by cutting key lending
rates, Mr Cho at first opposed the step. He relented after the government
agreed in return to deregulate most interest rates, a key step in financial
liberalisation.
The government is now debating whether more stimulative measures are needed
to achieve its target of at least 6 per cent GNP growth this year against
4.5 per cent in 1992.
Mr Kim said his priority as BOK governor would be to stabilise the currency.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Veterans of Long March leave stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE parliamentary session beginning today marks the end of an era for
China's veteran communist leaders who joined the Long March to safe bases in
northern China in 1934 to 'live to fight another day', writes Tony Walker.
It will be the first time since the founding of the People's Republic in
October 1949 that Long March veterans will be absent from top-ranking state
posts, including the presidency, premiership and chairman of the Central
Military Commission.
The official Beijing Review reported that 'veteran revolutionaries'
President Yang Shangkun and Mr Wan Li, chairman of the National People's
Congress, intended to retire. Mr Wan made a farewell appearance yesterday at
the Congress presidium, which prepares parliamentary sessions. The Beijing
Review said that Mr Yang, 86, and Mr Wan, 77, were making way for 'young
blood'.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Congress looks to Deng's reformist legacy: China's
rubber-stamp parliament is meeting at a significant time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN delegates of the rubber-stamp Chinese parliament convene today, the
event will be of more than its usual significance. It may well be their last
chance further to strengthen legislative support for the reformist legacy of
maximum leader Deng Xiaoping.
About 3,000 delegates to the National People's Congress, theoretically
representing a quarter of mankind, will be asked to endorse a revised
constitution to enshrine economic reforms and to approve personnel changes
designed to ensure that Mr Deng's work will be carried on after his death.
As China prepares for transition - Mr Deng is 83 and has aged noticeably in
the past year - formal events like the Congress assume special importance;
they provide an opportunity for the dominant faction to strengthen its grip
through new appointments and constitutional reform.
Congresses run for five-year terms, meeting annually. The timing of this
eighth Congress, marking a new cycle, is perhaps fortuitous. It coincides
with accelerated efforts to prepare for an orderly passage to a post-Deng
regime, although personal ambition and ideological differences make the
likelihood of such a smooth transfer problematical.
Much emphasis in these next two weeks will be given to strengthening the
underpinnings for the collective leadership to rule after Mr Deng goes to
'meet Karl Marx', words he sometimes uses to refer euphemistically to his
death.
Thus, the consensus figure of Mr Jiang Zemin, party boss, is expected to
assume the dual role of president, or head of state: Mr Li Peng, the
premier, who is identified with the conservative faction, will be 'elected'
to a second five-year term; reformist economic tsar Mr Zhu Ronji, heir
apparent to the premiership, is tipped to be designated 'senior', or
executive, vice-premier, to distinguish him from the other four
vice-premiers.
In this leadership soup, Mr Deng and his supporters no doubt hope that a
reasonable balance will have been achieved between various trends, ranging
from the cautious Mr Li to the adventurous Mr Zhu.
Mr Jiang, referred to in the official press as the 'core' leader, is
expected to mediate between competing trends, a role Mr Deng, with his
immense authority, has been performing since his re-emergence from political
disgrace in the late 1970s.
It is a moot point whether the 67-year-old Mr Jiang, who has no reputation
for banging heads together, is capable of mediating effectively. But his
elevation to the presidency is obviously designed to increase his authority
and reflects concerns about the fairly urgent need to find someone capable
of settling disputes among squabbling officials in the post-Deng period.
The promotion of Mr Jiang, to go with the general secretaryship of the
Communist party, marks something of a step away from an earlier commitment
to separate, where possible, functions of party and state. In fact, this
Congress will be marked by a strengthening of the party's hand in state
business, a sign that it is determined to retain both symbolic and actual
control in a period of accelerated economic reform.
The other main task of the Congress, apart from endorsing revised economic
growth targets for the coming year, is to approve a re-drafted constitution
(a fifth version in China's post-1949 history) to incorporate China's
commitment to a 'socialist market economy', or, in Mr Deng's words,
'socialism with Chinese characteristics'. Both these phrases appear in the
draft and reflect key resolutions adopted by the 14th Communist party
Congress last October, which gave the party's somewhat belated formal
blessing to the move away from rigid central economic control that had been
under way for some years.
The importance attached to the market, as opposed to planning, in the new
draft is indicative of the revolution that has taken place in Chinese
thinking. Thus, simple new wording - '(China) practises socialist market
economy' - has been substituted for the previous (1982) version, which
relegated the role of the market to one quite subsidiary to 'economic
planning'.
Much attention will probably focus on Premier Li's 'work report', which will
effectively be China's policy blueprint for the coming year. Mr Li has made
no secret of his worries about recent high rates of economic growth of more
than 12 per cent last year leading to overheating.
The Chinese-language press in Hong Kong has suggested that Mr Li was
resisting a four-square endorsement of the Deng faction's insistence on
accelerated reform. But, perhaps, he has been obliged to fall into line as a
price of holding on to his premiership for another five years. Still, his
report seems certain to mention dangers of excessive growth.
This Congress is not expected to produce any surprises. It will be carefully
stage-managed. Failure to adhere to the script would almost certainly ensure
delegates would not be returning next year.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Beijing accuses Britain of 'colonialism': Harsh criticism
follows Patten's move on democratic reform in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday bitterly attacked Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's decision
to proceed with democratic reform, accusing Britain of returning to a
colonialist path.
The harsh criticism seems certain to be reflected in remarks made at the
National People's Congress by, among others, Premier Li Peng, who is due to
address the opening session of the parliament today.
Using language reminiscent of some of the worst moments in the sometimes
turbulent Sino-British relationship, People's Daily, the Communist party
newspaper, accused Mr Patten of undermining the Beijing-London accord on
Hong Kong's future.
'This is another serious step taken by Patten to break the Sino-British
joint declaration,' the paper charged. 'We feel shock and regret at such an
act. Through these disputes, more people will see the old-brand colonialists
in their true colours.'
British officials in Beijing say they cannot predict where the Hong Kong
issue may go from here, although they note that the media attacks
conspicuously have not ruled out a continuation of diplomatic contacts.
Hopes were raised earlier this month that the delicate 'talks about talks'
involving Britain's ambassador in Beijing and Chinese officials would lead
to a resumption of direct discussions on the democratic reform. But these
contacts foundered when China adamantly refused to accept the participation
of Hong Kong representatives as equal partners in any talks.
The latest Chinese blast seems certain further to rock Hong Kong capital
markets. The Hang Seng stock market index fell more than 3 per cent on
Friday after Mr Patten announced that he was proceeding with his
controversial legislation under which the people of Hong Kong would elect
more than half their legislators at a poll due in 1995.
China insists that Mr Patten's plan runs counter to understandings reached
with London on the transition to Chinese rule in 1997. Officials in Beijing
argue that broad-based elections favoured by Mr Patten would undermine an
agreed status quo.
In Hong Kong, the community appears split between reformers urging Mr Patten
to proceed with his legislation, gazetted on Friday in preparation for its
introduction to the Legislative Council, and an increasingly nervous
business community.
The People's Daily editorial mirrors a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement
which also expressed 'shock' at Mr Patten's announcement.
Mr Patten defended his decision on Friday to go ahead with the legislation,
saying that he was sticking to his principles. 'Nobody should think that
being accommodating, being conciliatory, is the same as abandoning your
principles,' he said.
However, he left open the possibility of further discussions with China.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Behind the public face of the Swedish labour model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE SWEDEN's unemployment record was the envy of the developed world in
the 1980s, at home the popularity of Swedish-style social democracy waned.
But the last two years of conservative government have yet to provide an
attractive alternative. So far Prime Minister Carl Bildt's attack on the
public sector has delivered a deep recession, a rising budget deficit and an
increase in unemployment to very un-Swedish proportions. If his minority
government loses next week's vote of confidence, forcing a general election
in the summer, then the Swedish labour market model may yet be granted a
reprieve.
The evidence of the last two decades certainly suggests that voters should
think twice before ditching Sweden's labour market institutions. From
similar starting points in the early 1970s, Sweden's unemployment rate
remained around 3 per cent throughout the 1980s while rates in most other
OECD countries soared into double figures. Sweden's average unemployment
rate actually fell by 0.2 percentage points between 1968-73 and 1985-90
compared to a rise of 5.1 percentage points in Germany and 5.9 percentage
points in the UK.
Yet the conventional explanations for Sweden's success - centralised
pay-bargaining and re-training schemes for the unemployed - do not seem
satisfactory. Even countries such as Australia, which had relatively
successful co-ordinated pay-bargaining systems and thus above average real
wage flexibility, suffered a large rise in structural unemployment in the
1980s. And while Sweden's active labour market programmes pushed a quarter
to a third of outflows from unemployment into relief work and training, the
OECD has not been able to find empirical evidence to suggest that they
actually improved the job prospects of participants. In any case, they
absorbed on average less than 3 per cent of the labour force in the 1980s.
The missing element in Sweden's success story is public sector employment.
Sweden has traditionally had a larger government sector than other European
countries, as the chart shows. But while the share of government employment
in total employment rose by 2.1 percentage points in Germany between 1974
and 1990, and actually fell marginally in the UK, it rose by 6.9 percentage
points in Sweden over the same 16-year period.
Sweden was not alone. Aside from the dramatically small size of Japan's
government sector, the striking feature of the chart is the rapid growth of
public employment across the Nordic countries, all of which, with the
exception of Denmark, maintained very low unemployment rates by European
standards in the 1980s. This growth of public sector employment also helps
how the Nordic countries were able to avoid the rise in wage inequality that
plagued many other developed countries as a result of the declining demand
for unskilled labour. The growth in part-time employment among unskilled
workers in the UK and US in the 1980s, largely in the private sector,
required a large fall relative in the wages of low paid workers. But in
Sweden, the burden was borne not by low paid workers but by taxpayers who
financed the growth in better-paid public sector jobs. By 1988, total
Swedish taxes had risen to 55 per cent of gross domestic product, compared
to a European average tax share of 41 per cent.
The choice for Sweden's voters ought now to be relatively clear: a smaller
public sector should allow lower marginal and average tax rates but it will
also mean European-style unemployment rates. Sweden's wage-bargaining system
has again delivered a rapid fall in inflation by international standards but
this time Mr Bildt's public sector cuts mean it has been accompanied by a
rise in unemployment to more than 7 per cent of the labour force. Yet there
is one complication: unemployment benefits in previously low unemployment
Sweden are worth 90 per cent of previous earnings, much higher than in other
countries. So unless the government is prepared to cut welfare payments
while unemployment is still rising, it may find tax cuts hard to deliver, a
fact which could simplify the electorate's choice.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Election '93: Uphill struggle on the
stump - David Buchan finds voters in Normandy griping about the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER normal circumstances, Mr Pascal Lamy, head of Mr Jacques Delors's
private office, would have been in Hong Kong this weekend, scaling the
heights of international diplomacy. As the European Commission president's
'sherpa', he would have been helping to prepare for the Group of Seven's
June summit in Tokyo.
Instead, Mr Lamy was in deepest Normandy, campaigning as the Socialist party
candidate in the Eure department's fifth electoral district, but virtually
certain to taste defeat in the elections for the French National Assembly
next Sunday and on March 28.
Why is he making his first bid for election when the prospects for the
Socialists are so bad? 'Precisely because times are so terrible for the
Socialists,' says Mr Lamy. When the incumbent Socialist deputy decided not
to run, Mr Lamy, who has family roots in the region, was asked to take his
place. His quixotic gesture will earn him credit in whatever is left of the
Socialist party.
But the candidate readily acknowledges his obvious handicaps. After eight
years in Brussels, he is regarded as the outsider Eurocrat running against
local politicians.
All Socialist candidates have an uphill struggle in this election, but Mr
Lamy is a natural target for complaints about the European Community in
general and of the reform of its Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) in
particular, in this half-rural constituency which voted 56 per cent against
the Maastricht treaty in the referendum last September.
Mr Jean-Claude Asphe, hard-line Gaullist RPR mayor of Vernon and expected to
win the parliamentary seat, makes the most of this: 'We need a quick
revision of the CAP reform to be able to present a very tough position in
the Gatt (farm trade) negotiations with the Americans. These negotiations
cannot be left to EC officials, but to elected politicians.'
On Friday, Mr Edouard Balladur, the opposition's favourite candidate to be
France's next prime minister, arrived in Vernon to rub in the point in: 'We
cannot accept the CAP reform; we cannot accept the set-aside of so much land
from production. France is the world's number two agricultural exporter, and
there are not so many strong points in our economy that we can afford to
ignore any of them.'
The RPR leader goes on to demand 're-nationalisation of part of the CAP, so
that all is not decided far from us (in Brussels).'
For a French leader to urge even a partial break-up of the CAP strikes Mr
Lamy as nonsense: 'I can imagine John Major (UK prime minister) calling for
this but not Mr Balladur, because France has been a major beneficiary of the
CAP.' However, he supports Mr Balladur's call for French farmers to get more
compensation for price cuts and set-aside requirements.
'There are technical flaws which need correcting,' Mr Lamy says, because the
yield of farmers of the Eure, and therefore their claim to compensation for
not producing, has been under-estimated by Brussels. In more general terms,
Mr Lamy detects a pronounced swing towards protectionism in France. 'France
has never had a tradition of economic openness,' he points out in a
living-room meeting with Socialist activists at Les Andelys. Protectionism
in France is 'like a rheumatic ache - it always gets worse in bad weather',
like the country's current recession.
Like most other Socialist candidates, Mr Lamy prefers to find such domestic
remedies as work-sharing to reduce France's jobless total, near 3m.
The conservative opposition still has to overcome serious internal divisions
if it is to agree on a more aggressive external policy in government. The
rift over Maastricht is as evident as ever inside the RPR.
Mr Asphe, among the 70 per cent of the party's rank and file which voted
against the treaty, says he is still dead against this form of European
union. Yet it was Mr Balladur, as finance minister in 1987, who first
proposed a European central bank.
At Vernon on Friday, Mr Balladur smoothly proclaimed there was party
consensus that 'France should co-operate very closely with its partners, but
remain master of its destiny.' Whether such words can continue to paper over
the RPR's cracks may soon be tested in government.

THE conservative opposition alliance is heading for a resounding victory in
the French parliamentary elections on Sunday and March 28, but the level of
abstention is likely to be a record, according to the final opinion poll of
the campaign.
Violence erupted yesterday at a public meeting at Gardanne, near Marseilles,
addressed by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the far-right National Front.
Police had confiscated knives and missiles from NF supporters. Four people
were injured when protesters pelted the police with bottles and vegetables.
This was a rare outburst in the French election campaign, which has been
notable for a subdued tone. This hints at a high rate of abstentions which
an IFOP opinion poll in Journal du Dimanche yesterday reckoned could be 26
per cent - some six points above the norm.
Political pundits this weekend said that the high level of abstentions, with
voting intentions having changed little since campaigning began, was
indicative of the electorate's apathy. 'Everything suggests the campaign has
washed over the electorate like water off a duck's back,' said Liberation
newspaper.
The final IFOP poll confirmed these views by suggesting that the
conservatives would win 42 per cent of the votes, against 43 per cent in a
January sounding, leaving them with more than 400 of the 577 National
Assembly seats. The ruling Socialist camp is expected to emerge with 89-109
seats after mustering 20.5 per cent of the votes.
The ecologists, who had been gaining ground in the campaign, have slipped.
The poll yesterday suggests they will attract 14.5 per cent of the votes,
making them the largest protest grouping, ahead of the NF with 10.5 per
cent, and the Communists with 9.5 per cent.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Danes launch drive in support of energy tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Danish presidency of the EC is launching an effort to mobilise support
for the controversial energy tax put forward by the European Commission last
year to combat global warming.
As talks on the tax resume today at an EC finance ministers' meeting in
Brussels, Denmark is expected to announce it has scheduled an extraordinary
'jumbo' council of environment and energy ministers of the 12, on April 23
in Luxembourg.
The tax plan, part of a package to meet EC commitments to stabilise carbon
dioxide emisions at 1990 levels by 2000, has been sidelined since Brussels
adopted it last May, and has been made conditional on the US and Japan
taking analogous measures.
The conditionality is to safeguard European industrial competitivity.
The new push comes in the wake of President Bill Clinton's plans to
introduce a fuel tax in the US, and growing evidence that the EC cannot meet
its emissions targets through more conventional measures.
Before Washington's move last month, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, EC environment
commissioner, warned that, while Brussels remained committed to the energy
tax, its emissions strategy could take a long time to emerge from the EC
legislative pipeline.
Since then, the commissioner has been co-operating closely with the Danish
presidency and, according to his officials, is now 'talking up' the
possibilities of achieving a package including the tax.
If approved by the 12, the tax would start at Dollars 3 a barrel of oil
equivalent, rising to Dollars 10 a barrel by 2000. The mixed levy would fall
half on the fuel content of all non-renewable energy and half on its carbon
content.
It would be offset by tax reductions in other areas, such as social security
and corporate tax payments, which its advocates believe could help
job-creation.
Spain, however, remains strongly opposed to the tax, arguing that the richer
countries which emit most carbon dioxide, and have most resources to spend
on energy-saving and clean technology, should be set higher reduction
targets.
The Commission is looking at ways to rebalance the tax to shift more of the
burden from power generation - the costliest element for the poorer member
states - to transport. But the senior Commission official warned, 'you would
never get agreement on target-sharing' as demanded by Madrid.
Recent Commission studies on emissions, revealing that the most optimistic
forecasts of emissions by the 12 show that the EC would fall far short of
its stabilisation target, have added urgency to the debate.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Philippe Morillon, the French commander of United Nations troops in
Bosnia, has vowed to stay in the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica until a
stranded aid convoy arrives, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
He has set up headquarters in the eastern Bosnia town, which has been under
Serb siege for 11 months, said Mr Laurens Jolles of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees, who left Srebrenica yesterday.
The decision by Gen Morillon, who reached the town on Saturday, was warmly
endorsed by the French government. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy said:
'There are moments when one man can change the course of events.'
The UN aid convoy that had set out for Srebrenica yesterday was turned back
by Serb police backed by an armoured car. UN officials said the convoy,
carrying 125 tonnes of aid, travelled only 12 miles before being forced
back. About 60,000 people in Srebrenica have received no aid by road since
December, but the US Air Force dropped supplies by parachute into the area
on Saturday night. Thousands of refugees rushed to the hills when they
spotted aid palettes brought by parachute and several were reported to have
been killed in the scramble for food.
Mr Jolles said that thousands of ragged refugees were crowding the streets
of the town because there was no housing: 'There are streams of people
coming in. At night, you can see thousands of small fires in the streets
with people sitting around them.'
Gen Morillon went to Srebrenica with a small team after Dr Simon Mardel of
the World Health Organisation had reported that sick and wounded people
there were dying at the rate of 30 a day.
Dr Mardel described yesterday how Moslems in the area were dying in large
numbers from starvation or wounds from Serb artillery bombardments. He said
in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, that the torment he had witnessed in
Srebrenica and nearby Konjevic Polje surpassed his experiences in Ethiopia,
Liberia or Afghanistan.
Gen Morillon yesterday told the French TF1 television channel that the
arrival of the convoy was 'a matter of life or death'. He urged the US to
concentrate its aid effort on Srebrenica.
A third of Bosnia's lawmakers yesterday endorsed a new package of positions
on a peace plan presented by President Alija Izetbegovic, AP reports from
Sarajevo. Serb forces prevented other deputies from crossing siege lines to
attend. Acceptance came after Mr Izetbegovic and about 30 deputies - those
from Sarajevo - had discussed the peace plan drafted by negotiators Lord
Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance. The legislators prevented from entering Sarajevo
will meet today in Zenica.

FT  15 MAR 93 / West warned of retaliation by Gulf oil ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GULF OIL ministers yesterday expressed angry opposition to proposed energy
taxes in Europe and the US, with some threatening economic retaliation if
the west proceeds with such levies.
Mr Ali al-Baghli, Kuwaiti oil minister, said Gulf oil producers should raise
taxes on imports from the west if energy taxes are introduced.
Mr Youssef Shirawi, his Bahraini counterpart, said Gulf states should
retaliate by cutting oil exports and curbing planned increases in production
capacity.
The remarks followed a weekend meeting of Gulf Co-operation Council oil
ministers in Jeddah, after which ministers issued a statement opposing any
rise in taxes on oil by consumer countries. The communique asserted the
GCC's 'determination' to safeguard 'the continuation of the flow of their
exports without obstacles or restrictions.'
The GCC states - Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain
and Qatar - control almost half of global oil reserves.
All but Oman and Bahrain are members of the Organisation of
Petroleum-Exporting Countries, which has led a concerted campaign against
energy taxes being contemplated by the European Community and the US.
However, oil industry executives in the Gulf were highly sceptical that the
GCC statement would move far beyond rhetoric. 'Gulf producers have already
invested too much money in increasing oil output for threats of cuts to be
taken seriously,' said one. Several pointed out that the Gulf states rely
too heavily on the west for military protection to wish to jeopardise
relations.
Furthermore, it has long been the strategy of Saudi Arabia, the dominant GCC
country and the world's biggest oil exporter, to safeguard the long-term
security of oil supplies to the west, and thus the market for its main
export.
'Any action to oppose energy taxes is likely to be played out through Opec,'
said one Gulf oil executive. 'We all know how successful Opec is at agreeing
things.'

THE ISRAELI cabinet yesterday announced measures aimed at tightening
internal security, following a spate of attacks against civilians and
soldiers in the past week.
The cabinet convened for its weekly meeting as public anxiety over security
was further exacerbated by the police chief's call on all citizens licensed
to carry weapons to do so at all times.
Some 230,000 Israeli citizens, including most Jewish male adults in the
occupied territories, have gun licences.
Mr Yacov Terner, police chief, made his unprecedented call after a Jewish
woman had been hacked to death with an axe in the Gaza Strip and the body of
an Israeli soldier, shot dead, was found outside Jerusalem on Friday.
The police chief came under criticism at the cabinet meeting by ministers
who said his call to carry arms had provoked hysteria around the country.
To bolster security, the cabinet announced it would increase the number of
policemen stationed around the country by 2,000, bolster the civil guard and
provide incentives to Israeli employers to hire Jewish rather than
Palestinian workers.
The recent spate of attacks against Israeli citizens began after a
month-long hiatus following the expulsion of 415 Palestinians on December
17.
After the cabinet meeting, Mr Micha Harish, industry and trade minister,
said the defence establishment had been ordered 'to take all legal measures
to strengthen the war against terrorism'.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Germany disrupts the flow of traffic: Cabotage and the EC's
single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN Italian lorry driver sets off from Milan with a truckload of white goods
and delivers them three days later in Edinburgh. Faced with the prospect of
driving an empty truck back to the Continent, he would jump at the chance to
pick up a load of whisky and deliver it to London on his way. But single
market or no single market, he cannot do so under EC rules - unless, that
is, he has the necessary permit.
The free movement of goods and services, one of the basic preconditions of
the single European market, has a hollow ring about it when it comes to road
haulage in the Community. Three months into the new era of supposedly
unrestricted trade, hauliers still cannot ply for hire within other
countries' borders except under a quota system.
The harmful effects of this lack of accord spread far beyond the haulage
industry itself. Up to 20 per cent of lorry mileage in the EC is estimated
to be empty running. If more efficient use were made of the vehicle fleet,
transport costs would fall and the problems of congestion and pollution
could be sharply reduced.
As it is, long-running negotiations over liberalising the haulage regime
have become bogged down in an argument between member states over road
charges: an argument that will continue today as EC transport ministers meet
in an attempt to reach a solution.
Taken by itself, the issue of cabotage - EC jargon for the right to ply for
hire in another's territory - might not have proved particularly
controversial. Although some member states were concerned about the possible
impact on their domestic haulage industries, all would probably have agreed
on a gradual transition to a liberalised regime.
Progress was blocked, however, when Germany linked the issue to a much wider
debate about whether member states should be allowed to charge other
countries' lorries for the use of their roads.
Germany's complaint was that its geographical position at the heart of the
EC meant it was bearing by far the heaviest burden of international road
traffic. As a result, it needed to invest large sums in roads.
German lorry owners were already contributing towards the cost through heavy
annual road taxes, it pointed out. In contrast, vehicles from other
countries were not only getting free access to Germany's roads, but in most
cases paying much lower annual road taxes in their own countries too.
The solution Germany proposed was to require all lorries using its
motorways, whether German or international, to pay an annual fee of up to
DM9,000 (Pounds 3,800) for a licence or vignette to be displayed in their
windscreens. At the same time the road tax on German lorries would be
reduced.
The proposal caused uproar in the EC and was ruled unlawful in 1990 by the
European Court on the grounds that it would be discriminatory. But Germany
continues to insist that there can be no deal on cabotage without an
agreement on road charging, too.
At first sight, the row over the German scheme may appear inexplicable:
tolls, after all, are already found on many EC motorways and bridges. But
the difference between these tolls and the German road charges is that
existing tolls were introduced to pay for specific pieces of transport
infrastructure. The German charges, in contrast, were seen as a general tax.
Conceivably, the German plan would have attracted less opprobrium had it not
been linked to reductions in the annual road tax for German lorries. But
with other countries also looking for new sources of revenue to meet the
rising costs of providing transport infrastructure, road charging has now
turned into a significant issue in its own right.
Germany apart, several countries - France, Spain, Italy and Britain, for
example - favour road charging under certain conditions. Some of the smaller
member states, however, are deeply suspicious of the idea on any terms.
Among them are countries like Ireland that are dependent on transit through
a neighbouring country (in this case, the UK) for access to the rest of the
Community.
Others say if every country adopted the German scheme, the consequences
could be farcical: drivers crossing the EC would need so many vignettes they
would be unable to see through their windscreens.
The smaller member states want to see a uniform system under which everyone
needing access to other EC countries' roads would pay the same annual fee,
and the money collected would be distributed to EC countries according to
how much international traffic they carried. That plan, however, runs into
two obstacles: it would look like the imposition of a common tax at EC
level, and the allocation of the funds would cause perpetual rows.
Where the debate will end, nobody knows. Ultimately, the ideal would be for
lorries to be charged according to whose roads they used, not according to
the country they were registered in. But the technology needed to achieve
that goal is complex - and the politics, more complex still.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Cautious US backing for Yeltsin: Clinton unhappy with other
countries' response
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration has not sought to advise Mr Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian president, on how best to handle his current confrontation with the
Russian parliament, according to Mr Les Aspin, the US secretary of defence.
Interviewed on television yesterday morning, Mr Aspin reported that Mr
Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, had told his opposite number in
Moscow, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, on Friday only that the US hoped that whatever
course of action Mr Yeltsin chose was 'consistent with reform and human
rights'.
President Bill Clinton himself sent a further signal to other industrialised
countries on Saturday that more needs to be done financially and
economically to help the cause of economic reform in Russia.
He said other nations with a vital stake in the future of Russia had given
him what he called 'an inadequate response to date'. He added that 'a more
co-ordinated and aggressive approach' was required but did not indicate
whether he thought progress had been made at the meeting of Group of Seven
and Russian officials in Hong Kong over the weekend.
Asked if he was putting too much faith in Mr Yeltsin, the president
responded: 'We will work with what we have to work with, whatever happens.
But I think we should support him because he has been elected, after all.
'No-one knows what is going to happen, but the man is an honest democrat,
small 'd', and he's passionately committed to reform. I'm going to keep
working with him.' Mr Clinton and Mr Yeltsin are due to meet in Vancouver on
April 3-4.
He sidestepped questions about Mr Yeltsin's possible recourse to emergency
powers, including the use of the Russian military, to circumvent the
parliament and pursue reform. 'I don't think it would serve any useful
purpose for me to try and interpet the Russian constitution right now,' he
said.
Neither Mr Clinton and Mr Aspin minimised the importance of the power
struggle in Moscow.
The defence secretary said that arms control agreements, such as Start,
co-operation in foreign policy from Bosnia to Iraq, and the proposed
reductions in the US defence budget were potentially at risk.
Some senior officials have suggested that the US would not formally object
if Mr Yeltsin resorted to special powers, including the suspension of the
parliament, but would draw the line at a military crackdown. This seems to
be the broad import of Mr Christopher's message to Mr Kozyrev on Friday.
Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican from Indiana, said yesterday that the
US could 'conceivably' accept the temporary use of military power, but only
if it was invoked as an explicit prelude to proper elections in Russia. He
thought an early session between the US and Russian finance ministers would
be useful.
Senator Bill Bradley, the Democratic from New Jersey, also said it was
important for the US to keep open all lines of communication with other
centres of power, including the parliament, the army and the Russian
Orthodox Church.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA and Ukraine have failed to reach an agreement on the former Soviet
Union's foreign debt. After a meeting led by their prime ministers in Moscow
on Friday the two Slav countries appear further apart then ever.
Their failure may jeopardise the recent initiative by G7 leaders to cobble
together an aid package to bolster Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
beleaguered government.
However, Ukrainian officials claimed a breakthrough on energy prices and
supply, saying that, for the first time, Russia had agreed 'in principle' to
take into account transit fees for goods imported and exported through
Ukraine.
However, the prime ministers' meeting, promoted as the forum at which the
escalating economic conflict between the neighbours would be resolved, did
not produce a single specific agreement and was overshadowed by the power
struggle being waged a few blocks away in the Russian parliament.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister, said he would seek
a return to a temporary accord according to which Russia would assume the
management of the foreign debt but a final resolution of the division of the
debts and assets would be postponed.
BAT Industries, the leading British tobacco company, yesterday acquired a
majority stake in Ukraine's largest tobacco factories.
The Prylucky tobacco factory, 125km east of Kiev, produces nearly a fifth of
Ukraine's total cigarette output and is one of the most coveted prizes in
the fierce battle between western tobacco companies for a share in the
Ukrainian cigarette industry.
BAT will control 65 per cent of the new A/T BAT- Prylucky Tobacco Company,
and the management and workers of the Prylucky plant will initially hold 35
per cent. This is part of a wider trend in the industry to compensate for
declining smoking in the west.

FT  15 MAR 93 / W Europe car sales decline sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe plunged in February by 16.9 per cent, as demand
dropped steeply for the second month in succession.
According to industry estimates, new car sales fell in February to 925,000
from 1.1m a year earlier, led by sharp falls in four of the five leading
volume markets.
For the first two months of the year new car sales in west Europe have
fallen by around 20.6 per cent to 1.88m.
In Germany, the single biggest market in Europe, sales fell in February by
an estimated 22.7 per cent to 245,000, compounding the 27.5 per cent decline
suffered in January.
New car sales in Italy fell in February by 13.9 per cent year-on-year, while
new car registrations in France dropped by 21.5 per cent, and sales in Spain
fell by 33 per cent.
The UK, slowly emerging from over three years of recession, has become one
of the few markets in Europe to show growth, with a 16.1 per cent rise in
registrations in February.
UK sales have been higher than a year earlier in five of the last six
months, and have risen by 11 per cent year-on-year in the first two months
of 1993, albeit from a depressed level.
Overall, new car sales both in February and in the first two months of 1993
have been lower than a year ago in 14 of 17 markets across west Europe with
higher sales only in the UK, Ireland and Norway.
Losses are mounting at several car makers in Europe, as plants are forced on
to short-time working and thousands of jobs are eliminated.
Five of the big six volume carmakers in Europe, the Volkswagen group,
General Motors, PSA Peugeot-Citroen, Ford and Renault, have suffered a drop
in sales of more than a fifth in the first two months of the year.
European motor industry leaders are forecasting a decline in west European
new car sales for the full year of 9-15 per cent, after four years in which
demand has held steady at close to 13.5m.
In the first two months of the year only Rover, the vehicle subsidiary of
British Aerospace, has achieved a small increase in new registrations,
supported by its still heavy dependence on its domestic UK market.
Among the leading volume carmakers the Fiat group of Italy, which includes
Lancia and Alfa Romeo, has gained ground in market share and has moved into
second place, helped by the more moderate fall in demand in Italy than in
Germany, France and Spain.
Japanese carmakers' sales in west Europe in the first two months fell by an
estimated 16.8 per cent.

FT  15 MAR 93 / British Gas offers to decentralise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is to propose a compromise to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission to counter radical proposals by its regulator for a full-scale
break-up of the company.
British Gas is understood to have proposed splitting its UK gas business
into three wholly-owned subsidiaries, covering sales to the industrial
market, household supply and pipelines. The company could then disband its
central gas purchasing function, leaving its two sales units to buy their
own gas from the North Sea.
British Gas submitted itself to an MMC inquiry last August as a way of
preserving 15,000 jobs in its gas business. Regulatory demands on the
company, including a tough pricing formula, would have forced it to reduce
costs by Pounds 400m over five years and it would still have been incurring
a loss of Pounds 300m on its household sales business by 1997.
The MMC is due to present its report on April 30 to Ofgas, the industry
regulator, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Two weeks ago Ofgas called for British Gas to be broken up into 12 regional
companies, a purchasing arm and a stand-alone pipelines company.
British Gas believes a full break-up could cost as much as Pounds 3bn over
10 years, including Pounds 2bn to provide extra storage.
In addition, the company is understood to be fighting to keep its monopoly
over household supply, arguing that removal of the monopoly could compromise
safe-ty standards, endanger security of supply and service to disadvantaged
customers, and mean the end of uniform gas costs across the country.
British Gas contests claims by competitors that UK households would see
substantial savings - 10 per cent a year on gas bills - from the
introduction of competition to domestic supply.
The company says that if prices reflected the full cost of supply, some 12m
of its customers would pay more and 6m would pay less. Prices for customers
using less than 100 therms a year would nearly double.
By splitting up the gas purchasing arm, British Gas would make it easier for
independent gas shippers to have more access to North Sea supplies. The
company has been the dominant buyer in the North Sea for many years and
rival gas marketing companies have complained they could not compete with
its purchasing power.
The company is also believed to be discussing the creation of a market in
peak gas supplies which would address the problem of opening up the
interruptible supply sector to competitors. Interruptible customers are the
largest users of gas, paying less in return for being cut off during periods
of peak demand in the domestic market. The peak trading market could herald
the start of a spot market in gas sales.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Budget likely to help jobless and small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY was last night making final preparations for tomorrow's 1993-94
Budget which is expected to increase Britain's tax burden moderately but may
also strengthen Mr Norman Lamont's reputation as a fiscal innovator.
The chancellor's third Budget - and the last of the traditional spring
revenue-raising budgets - will contain a package of measures to help the
long-term unemployed and reduce the number of officially registered jobless
from more than 3m at present.
It is also expected to provide encouragement for small businesses, which Mr
John Major, the prime minister, believes can do most for job creation once
the UK pulls out of recession.
As Budget day has approached, speculation has increased that Mr Lamont will
partially offset tax increases by extending significantly the bottom 20 per
cent tax band, which he introduced last year for the first Pounds 2,000 of
taxable income.
Such a move would be a step towards turning the 20 per cent band into the
tax rate for the average citizen. It could be financed by freezing tax
thresholds for the higher paid and possibly by converting the personal tax
allowance - the amount that people can earn before they pay income tax -
into a tax credit that might apply at either the 25 per cent basic rate or
the 20 per cent rate of income tax. At present, allowances are deducted from
gross income to give disproportionate benefit to payers of the higher 40 per
cent tax rate.
The news blackout surrounding the chancellor's Budget plans has been tighter
than ever this year. But commentators believe Mr Lamont will announce a
radical and innovative package in an attempt to boost the government's
flagging political fortunes and his own chances of staying in office.
Apparently ruled out is a Budget Day cut in bank base rates from their
current 6 per cent level. In recent weeks, Mr Lamont and the Bank of England
have tried to discourage expectations of an early rate cut. The authorities
not only believe that 6 per cent is the right level to encourage economic
recovery but are concerned that lower rates could undermine sterling and so
rekindle inflationary pressures.
Mr Lamont's main objectives will be to encourage economic recovery and
convince financial markets that he will take no risks with inflation by
allowing the UK's large government deficit to spiral out of control.
Polls of City institutions, taken by the financial information companies MMS
International and IDEA, suggest that London's financial markets expect Mr
Lamont will raise taxes by Pounds 2bn to Pounds 2.25bn in tomorrow's Budget
and by Pounds 4bn in the first unified taxing and spending Budget in
November.
The markets are hoping for relatively good news on the deficit. The
consensus forecasts published by MMS and IDEA suggest the City expects Mr
Lamont to announce a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 35bn for
1992-93, down from the Pounds 37bn forecast in the government's Autumn
Statement. On the strength of the Budget measures, he is expected to predict
a deficit of about Pounds 45bn for 1993-94, below recent expectations of
Pounds 50bn.
The chancellor will take a relatively upbeat view of Britain's prospects:
according to an interview with the Independent on Sunday yesterday, he
believes Britain is heading for a 'period of normal and sustained growth'.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Brussels warns of tit-for-tat war with US on trade: Row
centres on Dollars 50m of federal contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISK of a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war rose yesterday after
senior EC officials warned that the Community might retaliate if the US were
to bar European companies from bidding on telecommunication and public
procurement contracts.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, called the
Clinton administration's unexpected withdrawal from talks on the procurement
dispute 'a very negative step' which was 'surprising and completely
unnecessary'.
His criticism followed Friday night's decision by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US
trade representative, to call off talks scheduled to take place in Brussels
today, and a clear US threat to impose sanctions later this month.
Sir Leon avoided threats of retaliation, but other EC trade officials said
Mr Kantor's abrupt move made it difficult to avoid a confrontation on March
22, the deadline which the US has set for the EC to dismantle allegedly
discriminatory procurement rules for water, gas, electrical and telecoms
contracts.
Mr Kantor said on Friday that the administration would bar European
companies from between Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) and Dollars 50m of federal
contracts if the EC failed to waive Article 29 in the EC utilities
directive, which came into force in January offering EC companies an
advantage in contract bidding within the Community.
A senior EC official said the scale of US sanctions was minimal in
comparison to the multi-billion dollar public procurement market, but the
timing could not have been worse. It comes near the climax of the French
parliamentary election campaign and with the Gatt Uruguay Round trade talks
poised on a knife-edge.
The official warned that the EC might be forced to make a political gesture
in response to 'blatant political pressure', raising the risk of a
retaliatory trade war.
The US and EC have been sparring over government procurement rules for
months.
The US claims that bidding opportunities worth Dollars 16.8bn were offered
to EC contractors under the Gatt government procurement code in 1990,
compared with Dollars 7.8bn in EC contracts open to US companies.
The EC agrees that in absolute terms the 1990 Gatt figures confirm that the
US is more generous, but Brussels officials argue that the value of EC
contracts open to US companies rose sharply between 1985 and 1990, while the
value of US contracts fell over the same period.
Sir Leon was apparently not informed of Mr Kantor's announcement before it
became public.
Speaking from Prague, Sir Leon suggested that the US had missed an
opportunity to discuss constructive ideas which might have led to a
resolution of the dispute.
EC officials said these ideas revolved around introducing reciprocity in
EC-US government procurement, with the EC using Article 29 as a bargaining
chip to gain access to lucrative transport and energy contracts at state
level, or so-called 'sub-Federal procurement'.
A spokesman for Sir Leon said in Brussels yesterday that the Commissioner
was determined to avoid public threats of retaliation. 'We are going to play
the game properly right down to the wire.'
However, the spokesman agreed that Mr Kantor's threats of sanctions had
raised the stakes in US-EC relations, putting even more pressure on the US
trade representative's planned talks with Sir Leon in Brussels on March 29.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Kohl clinches pact on east Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BEAMING Chancellor Helmut Kohl, accompanied by opposition leader Mr Bjorn
Engholm and state premiers from east Germany, announced agreement at the
weekend on the public financing package to underpin a 'solidarity pact' for
the east German economy.
The cross-party deal, finalised in 2 1/2 days of almost uninterrupted
negotiations, puts into place the last main element in the pact which Mr
Kohl has been seeking since September with the opposition, the 16 federal
states, employers and trade unions.
The package of tax increases, spending cuts and increased subsidies and
credit for the east was welcomed across the political spectrum as a deal
which would revive the standing of the leading political parties in Bonn.
There was no immediate reaction from the German Bundesbank which has been
watching the talks closely as the key to future public spending control.
The central bank was not prepared to give any indication to financial
markets about its future interest rate policy, seeking merely to play down
speculation that a solidarity pact agreement would automatically lead to
further relaxation. The agreement received a cautious welcome from German
industry.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and principal architect of the package,
said it would have a positive impact on international attitudes to Germany
and in giving the Bundesbank room for manoeuvre. 'It will have a positive
effect on the financial markets, and I am sure it will also have positive
effect on the future decisions of the Bundesbank.'
Mr Waigel spelt out the details on Saturday night of a package which will
raise income tax by 7.5 per cent through a reintro-duced 'solidarity
surcharge' from January 1 1995, and raise public borrowing for east Germany
by some DM60bn (Pounds 25.4bn).
The increased borrowing consists of DM30bn for the Treuhand privatisation
agency to finance the continuing restructuring of unprivatised 'core
industries' in east Germany and DM30bn for housing modernisation to speed up
privatisation of dilapidated state-owned apartments.
In return for a delay in the tax rise, Mr Engholm's Social Democrats have
won agreement that no social spending will be cut in a package of DM9.2bn in
central government budget savings. They have agreed that a campaign against
false social security and unemployment claimants should be launched.

Residents check the damage to their neighbourhood in Gainesville, Florida,
after it was hit by winter storms which left a trail of devastation along
the Atlantic coast of the US. Up to 66 people were killed, motorways and
airports were closed by heavy snow and flooding, and millions of homes were
left without electricity. A state of emergency was declared by governors in
12 states, and President Bill Clinton ordered emergency aid to parts of
Florida. By late yesterday, airports had re-opened, though delays were

<TEXT>
While working in London, Boris Fyodorov used to send advice to the reformist
Russian government in the form of 'Notes from Afar' - a joking reference to
Lenin's commentaries on the revolution which began without him in 1917.
After returning to Russia as deputy prime minister for economics and finance
in December, this pugnacious 35-year-old is now at the centre of a battle to
save a market revolution begun by others.
Two years ago, he quit as finance minister in protest against Mr Boris
Yeltsin's failure to even start reform, and went to work abroad. Now, he
says the government will fight on for its policies regardless of last week's
bruising defeat by the Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian
president, whom he describes as 'our main hope and support'.
The obstacles are formidable to the government pulling the country back from
the brink of hyperinflation and pursuing economic restructuring. Its room
for manoeuvre is limited by parliament, which wants not only to reduce Mr
Yeltsin to a figurehead role but reverse his radical reform course.
Meanwhile, the central bank, no doubt anticipating a change of cabinet, is
refusing to adjust monetary policy to the government's economic strategy.
'Either you send sailors to occupy the central bank,' Fyodorov joked in an
interview, referring to Lenin's use of force to break up Russia's
constituent assembly in 1918, 'or probably the central bank should assume
all responsibility for the economy and run it. Then we shall see how they
want to stimulate long-term investment at very low interest rates with
inflation at 1,000 per cent.'
Joking aside, he said after the congress that it was a 'matter of life or
death' for the government to get on with its job and for the central bank to
co-operate. 'Either order is restored to this country, or it will continue
to slide further and further into economic crisis.'
For this reason, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, joined
President Yeltsin last week in calling for the central bank to be
transferred from parliament to government control.
Fyodorov wants the central bank to agree to fixed limits for the growth of
credit to the state and state-owned enterprises, even if it means telling
the government there is no more money to finance the budget deficit.
'If the central bank did this, I would applaud them,' said Fyodorov, a
former banker who was passed over for the central bank's chief job last year
but makes no secret of the fact that he could have achieved far more there
than in his present role.
'The government would then be forced to think better how to use scarce
resources and get into policymaking - like social security and unemployment
benefit - instead of trying to deal with kilos of milk and each state-owned
enterprise.'
Next he wants an end to the subsidising of former Soviet republics through
the issue of unbacked Russian central bank credits, which accounted for 25
per cent of credit expansion over the past year. He says these 'technical
credits' and the continuing deliveries of rouble banknotes by Russia are
delaying a decision by other republics on whether to introduce their own
currencies, or follow strict conditions to keep the rouble as their
currency.
Brought into the government to balance the appointment of an industrialist
without an economic background as premier, Fyodorov advocates a 'normal'
western-style solution to the plight of Russia's impoverished neighbours.
'If loans to these republics are necessary, we should have loan agreements,
with terms, collateral and an interest rate,' he says, describing the
present system of printing money for them as a 'real disaster'.
Attempting to use the good connections he kept while abroad, he has already
tried and failed to convince opposition politicians to avoid 'at least
superfluous disagreements' over economic policy.
Other obstacles he faces include a scarcity of reliable economic data and of
skilled professionals within the state bureaucracy. 'In the two years I've
been away . . . the better people have already left (for the private
sector).'
Hinting at nostalgia for the bureaucracies he encountered while at the
European Bank for Reconstruction and the World Bank, he also bemoans 'the
dozens of signatures required on the back of any paper', and the time he has
to waste meeting people 'who have nothing to do with policy'.
But ambitious for himself and his country, he has no regrets over trading a
comfortable, but comparatively dull, life in the west for what is likely to
be the toughest fight of his life.
'I want to see this country changed so it becomes a normal country and I
don't have to intervene,' he explains.
Fyodorov saw the need for radical change early on. Like many Russian
politicians and professionals of his generation, he joined the Soviet
Communist party as a means to get ahead. But between completing his doctoral
thesis in economics, and working for the party's policymaking central
committee, he had already become committed to a pro-market ideology.
In 1990, he helped draft the radical 500-day programme for market reform,
which was buried by the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. In June 1990, he
joined Mr Yeltsin's first administration in the hope that at least small,
practical steps could be taken to build a market system in the biggest
Soviet republic.
Today, he cannot say whether he will succeed, but he believes that the
tumultuous collapse of the Communist party's rule while he was away shows
that 'anything is possible in Russia'.
'Cutting the budget deficit and producing a normal central bank is a much
easier task than ousting the Communist party. That I would never have
believed possible 10 years ago. But now I can imagine radical reform
happening in Russia.'
The politician in Fyodorov makes him say he is not counting on foreign help
 -an unpopular subject in Russia following the failure of the pro-western
strategy pursued last year by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister.
But he suggests that it will be almost impossible for painful reforms to
succeed without it.
'We're not Chinese,' he says, referring to the success of economic reforms
under authoritarian rule in China. 'The question is: can we find mechanisms
to substitute for dictatorship or occupation forces (such as those which
pushed through economic adjustment in Germany and Japan after the second
world war). Foreign aid could be a good substitute.'
Asked to prepare Russian proposals for Mr Yeltsin's April 4 meeting with US
President Bill Clinton, Fyodorov was in Hong Kong yesterday to brief
representatives of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations on how the
west might prop up reforms in Russia.
His suggestions include a social fund to help support the unemployed if
tight credit policies are instituted, plus a programme to encourage the
growth of small businesses to create new jobs. He would also like funds to
help stabilise the rouble and restructure state-owned industry.
But he says Russia must first institute restrictive financial policies,
without which 'everything else would be wasted', and to devise mechanisms so
that foreign cash is not squandered.
'There is no point in receiving assistance if it is not targeted (at
specific problems). The question is how to receive this money properly, how
to organise it - this is very, very difficult and frustrating,' he says,
talking from his experience of the small flows of western finance trickling
into Russia.
Despite his determination to press ahead whatever the west does, western
guarantees of support over the coming weeks could play an important role in
domestic Russan political battles. But Fyodorov stresses that such money
should only become available if and when Russia can keep its side of any
bargain. 'We have talked far too long. It is now time for action.'

FT  15 MAR 93 / A subtle battle of monetary wills: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central bankers and elected politicians have an uneasy relationship in most
democracies. The US is no exception. Although the Federal Reserve has
historically enjoyed far greater independence than, say, the Bank of
England, it is careful to describe itself as independent within, rather than
of, government. Many Democrats, moreover, are pressing for reforms to make
it more open and accountable.
Mr Donald Riegle, chairman of the Senate banking committee, is one of
several senior Democrats sponsoring bills that would increase Congress's
leverage over the Fed. Flexing his political muscles last week, he summoned
all 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks to Washington to
deliver their first ever testimony en masse before his committee. The
presidents were squashed together like a row of sardines and solemnly
lectured on the need for 'teamwork' in the conduct of monetary and fiscal
policy. Following President Bill Clinton's election, the nation was
expecting 'more accountability from everybody', Mr Riegle declared, before
departing early for a more important meeting at the White House.
The hearing was civil, although some of the presidents seemed disconcerted
by the lordly demeanour of the senators, who wandered in and out of the
hearing room, sometimes leaving their guests with hardly anybody to talk to.
The presidents were kept sitting in place for more than four hours, finally
being dismissed well after the normal lunch break. But the meeting has set a
precedent: if and when inflation starts to rise and the Fed shows signs of
tightening policy, the presidents will be hauled in for a public roasting.
Even in today's benign economic climate, senators were seeking assurances
that presidents would loosen monetary policy if deficit-cutting legislation
retards growth.
The presidents are a target because they hold, in rotation, five of the 12
votes on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that sets the
level of short-term interest rates (and hence strongly influences the
short-run jobless rate). The Fed's board of governors, headed by Mr Alan
Greenspan, holds the other seven votes. Yet while the Fed's governors are
appointed by the White House and subject to Senate confirmation, the
regional presidents are elected by private-sector boards and thus escape
direct scrutiny by Congress.
Mr Riegle is co-sponsoring a bill introduced by Mr Paul Sarbanes, a
colleague on the banking committee, that would strip the presidents of their
right to vote on monetary policy decisions. The legislation is supported by
Mr Jim Sasser, chairman of the powerful Senate budget committee, and in the
House of Representatives by such heavyweights as Mr Lee Hamilton and Mr
David Obey, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
A separate bill championed by Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the house
banking committee, goes further. It would keep the FOMC but subject regional
presidents to the same selection and confirmation process as governors. It
would mandate a more diverse FOMC, with positions reserved for women,
minorities, community groups and unions. It would tackle excessive secrecy
by subjecting the Fed to the Freedom of Information Act and by requiring the
timely release of videotapes of FOMC meetings. Finally, it would ask a
review body to investigate whether the geographical distribution of the
regional Feds (which are clustered in the east) is appropriate given huge
population and income shifts in the past 80 years.
The critics have some good points. As private citizens partly responsible
for public policy, the regional presidents do have an anomalous role. There
are few, if any, parallels abroad: even in Germany, the Land presidents who
sit on the Bundesbank's policymaking central bank council are nominated by
the Bundesrat (the upper house of parliament) and formally appointed by the
president.
And last week the regional presidents - 12 middle-aged white males -
inadvertently underlined the lack of diversity at the Fed. There has only
ever been one female regional Fed president. No black or Hispanic has ever
held the top job, not even at the Atlanta Fed, which covers much of the
south.
The Fed is clearly vulnerable to the criticism that it does not promote
minorities or women. But it is likely to resist any other changes on the
grounds that the present system, even if anachronistic, seems to work quite
well. The Democratic critics, for their part, are not likely to push their
legislation too hard. With the economy reviving, the Fed is much less
unpopular than at the height of the recession. Mr Greenspan, moreover, is a
canny opponent, having already put himself in Mr Clinton's good books by
warmly endorsing the president's economic plan - a move which is spurring
the recovery by helping drive down long bond yields.
But this does not mean the Democratic campaign is not succeeding. The real
goal is to intimidate the Fed's policymakers, to make the institution more
malleable. The US is at a monetary turning point: depending on decisions in
the next few years, the Fed will either firmly establish price stability for
the first time since the 1950s or permit short-sighted politicians to embark
on yet another inflationary cycle. The economic stakes could not be higher.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Wanting it both ways: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the French first elected a conservative majority to parliament, in
1986, to serve alongside their sitting Socialist president, they called it
'cohabitation'. Some said it proved the stability and the democratic
maturity of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic.
But history rarely repeats itself. Next Sunday's election will again bring
the right back to power. But this time the swing of the pendulum will be so
fierce that cohabitation may test the constitution close to destruction.
The Socialists face the prospect of a humiliating defeat. Its severity will
certainly shake the Socialist party to its foundations; the lesson may have
equally seismic repercussions on the whole of the French political system;
but its most immediate constitutional effect may be to undermine the
political authority of the president.
The conservatives are virtually certain to win an overwhelming majority in
parliament. The Gaullist RPR party and the UDF centre-right grouping could
between them get over 400 seats; the Socialists could drop to as few as 100.
This must lead to frequent tests of will between the government and the
president. And they are likely to be more intense than in 1986-88, because
the right will have a much bigger majority. Some conservatives talk as if
the scale of their prospective majority will give them the power, and even
the right, to force President Mitterrand out of office. If so, France would
be facing not cohabitation, but a major constitutional crisis.
This crisis may not occur. First, the conservative parties are deeply split
on policy, and these splits are likely to gape wider as a result of the size
of the conservative majority. Second, the leaders of the conservative
parties are already locked in near-mortal combat for the presidential
election looming two years away, and this struggle will become their top
pre-occupation the day after the parliamentary election. So the new
government majority may be much weaker than its size would imply.
A third factor could precipitate a constitutional struggle, however. In
their election campaigns, Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, and Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader, both included protectionist commitments
on agriculture, which could threaten serious conflicts with France's
European partners and with the wider world of international trade. They have
called for a renegotiation of the European farm policy reform package agreed
by the 12 a year ago; both have rejected the farm deal provisionally agreed
last year between the European Commission and the previous US
administration.
President Mitterrand may not be one of nature's free traders; with high and
rising unemployment, he may even believe that some reversion to France's
atavistic protectionist reflexes would be politically popular; but his
commitment to the closer integration of Europe is absolute. If Chirac and
Giscard seek a major battle with the Community over the farm policy, this
could provoke a fight with the president; and it is not clear, under the
constitution, who would win.
The fundamental question posed by this election, however, is not whether the
constitution can handle a political conflict between the president and the
National Assembly; it is whether the political system in general can offer
answers to the country's problems.
The Socialists will be repudiated on a grand scale: they have been there too
long, and they are too contaminated by corruption. But there is no wave of
popular enthusiasm for the conservative parties: the prospect is for a large
protest vote. The ecologists, the Communists and the extreme right-wing
National Front could between them rack up some 35 per cent of the total.
The huge conservative majority will be mainly due to the French voting
system, which penalises small parties. A second reason is that part of the
Gaullist party has shifted sharply to the right; it is eating into the
support of the National Front by openly espousing nationalist and
anti-European nostrums. Last year the Maastricht treaty votes revealed deep
hostility among a majority of Gaullist members; the party is likely to have
even more anti-Community members next time round.
However, the conservative leaders are trying to have it both ways. They are
promising a leap back in history, in the hope of appealing to the farmers
and the anti-Europeans; Chirac even promises to boycott the Community, in
order to block an EC-US farm deal. On the other hand, they insist on
France's continued commitment to the strong franc policy, and they promise
new initiatives to strengthen monetary links with Germany, coupled with the
independence of the Banque de France.
The explanation for this contradiction is simple: the election victory is a
poisoned chalice for the conservatives. They do not have an answer to the
central political problem, which is unemployment; and they have no
alternative economic policy to that of the Socialists. By the time of the
1995 presidential election, they will have been in power long enough to be
held responsible, but will not have been able to bring down unemployment.
In addition to the scapegoats from the past (the Socialists), therefore,
they must set up external enemies, in Brussels and Washington. You may think
it rather difficult to combine a protectionist policy on agriculture with an
integrationist policy on money; so does Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister. But if you were Bill Clinton, toying with the pros and cons of
starting some trade conflicts with the outside world, you would have one
reason to hold your hand: the French may take the blame for firing the first
shot.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Budget test for Pounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Budget is expected to make an impact on the currency markets this
week although analysts are divided as to how sterling will react, writes
Emma Tucker.
Many analysts have ruled out another UK base rate cut following comments
from the Bank of England that it is concerned not to see sterling drop below
its current level of around DM2.39. Nevertheless, if Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, announces severe fiscal tightening measures tomorrow, the
foreign exchanges may react badly in anticipation of further monetary
easing. In the longer term, however, a tight budget would improve prospects
for the currency.
With the economic recovery still fragile, it may be that the chancellor
confines himself to outlining plans for reducing the public sector borrowing
requirement in the medium term.
The other big event for the currency markets this week is Thursday's regular
Bundesbank council meeting. The German bank has eased the rates on its 14
and 28-day repo funds, but this is no guarantee that it will announce a cut
in its discount and Lombard rates on Thursday.
Mr Julian Jessop of Midland Global Markets believes the Bundesbank will not
cut its discount rate until it is satisfied that the Solidarity Pact has
been fully agreed.
This will be of little comfort to the French, however, whose currency may
suffer speculative pressure ahead of the first round of national assembly
elections next weekend. French opposition parties, which are expected to win
the vote, face the dilemma of wishing for a substantial cut in interest
rates while at the same time maintaining the franc's link to the D-Mark.
The peseta, the krone and the escudo may also come under attack. On Friday
there was intense selling of the escudo as the markets reacted with
hostility to apparent differences between the finance ministry and the Bank
of Portugal.

FT  15 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Dresdner Bank goes to the top of the
D-Mark table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the first quarter coming to a close, the volume of new D-Mark Eurobond
issues so far this year puts Dresdner Bank ahead of Deutsche Bank in the
D-Mark underwriting league table.
Excluding in-house deals, Dresdner has launched DM11.55bn worth of D-Mark
issues since the start of 1993, compared with DM10.90bn for Deutsche,
according to the new international bond issues tables published daily by the
Financial Times.
The figures also show that the two banks have consolidated their dominant
position in the D-Mark sector - Commerzbank comes a poor third with DM1.7bn,
excluding an in-house deal - and that the profile of foreign banks remains
low.
Observers believe that Dresdner's emergence at the top of the table, as well
as its recent success in winning mandates such as the DM2.9bn Eurobond issue
for the European Community, reflects a sweeping re-organisation of the
bank's new issues department.
The man wielding the broom is Mr Hansgeorg Hofmann, who joined Dresdner at
the end of 1989 from Shearson Lehman. Insiders say that Mr Hofmann has
galvanised his team into embracing a more international approach to the
syndication and trading of new issues.
For example, it was Dresdner which introduced the fixed price re-offer
concept to the D-Mark sector when it arranged a DM2.5bn issue for Sweden
last October.
This mechanism, which had been adopted several years earlier in the other
sectors of the international bond market, makes the pricing of issues more
transparent for the investor. It has also made the new issues business more
profitable for the banks involved in underwriting the deals.
Before the introduction of the fixed price re-offer, the D-Mark sector was
still geared to Europe's army of retail investors. But since then, the
market has opened up more to international and institutional investors.
Dresdner's fresh approach to the new issues business has coincided with a
marked increase in demand for D-Marks over the last year. The collapse of
the Ecu market, following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty,
heightened the currency's 'safe haven' attraction for investors.
At the same time, the D-Mark sector was one of only a few areas of the
Eurobond market which offered sufficient liquidity to sovereign borrowers
seeking to replenish their currency reserves after the turmoil in the
exchange rate mechanism.
Not surprisingly, sovereign and supranational borrowers have dominated the
D-Mark sector so far this year. Most of the deals slated to appear in the
first quarter have been launched, though one further issue of up to DM2bn
could emerge by the end of the month.
Borrowers are being discouraged by the widening of yield spreads on D-Mark
sovereign paper over German government bonds, following the downgradings of
the foreign-currency debt of Italy and Finland.
For example, the yield spread on Italy's 7 1/4 per cent Eurobonds due 1998
has widened to 65 basis points over bunds compared with a spread of 47 basis
points at the launch in January. The spread on Finland's 7 1/2 per cent
seven-year Eurobonds has increased to 80 basis points from 53 basis points.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Risk and Reward: Wave of FRNs helps to meet surprise demand
in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG run in the US Treasury market has brought long-bond yields down
to new lows. With deposit rates languishing at around 3 per cent, investors
are keener than ever to find a way to enhance their returns. And they have
become increasingly willing to take positions to express their views on the
market.
The latest trend is for plays on the shape of the yield curve, or on bond
yields, as well as on short-term rates.
While short-term interest rates in European markets are still expected to
fall, US short-term rates are widely believed to have reached their lows.
But when they will start to rise, how the shape of the yield curve will
change and which way bond yields will move are questions which investors are
addressing.
The result has been a wave of structured products to meet a demand the depth
of which has surprised bankers. In the US market, the US agencies have
issued a spate of CMT floating-rate notes, a structure which pegs the coupon
rate to 10-year Treasury yields (the reference yield is the
constant-maturity treasury or CMT).
The concept has now been brought to the Eurobond market by Lehman Brothers,
whose brand name for the instrument is the SURF - step-up recovery floater.
The coupon of these seven-year instruments is reset every six months to
equal half of the CMT rate plus a predetermined margin. In addition, the
notes offer a minimum interest rate of interest of, say, 5 per cent.
With 10-year Treasury yields around 6 per cent, an investor would
theoretically receive 4 1/2 per cent, so the minimum coupon of 5 per cent
appears attractive. This is below current seven-year yields - the seven-year
US Treasury yield is quoted at about 5.6 per cent - because the interest
rate is reset every six months, but the investor has some upside potential
from an increase in 10-year yields, whereas a fixed-rate bond holder loses
capital if yields rise.
The structure represents a play on the yield curve. The investor is taking
the view that the US yield curve will remain steep over a period of time -
or that if it flattens, rates will be low across the curve - and expects the
downside protection of 5 per cent to be sufficient compensation if this view
proves incorrect. Many market professionals are taking the opposite view.
Dealers report a high level of activity concentrated on plays on a
flattening of the US yield curve.
'Basically, a lot of people are buying the long end and shorting the front
end of the US Treasury market,' said one trader.
The CMT floater structure is economically viable because the derivative
products used to create it are relatively cheaply available in the OTC
market. This reflects an assumption among many traders that the yield curve
will flatten. The spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries has already
declined from around 370 basis points in the autumn to below 300 basis
points.
The theory is that economic recovery is on the way in the US, so short-term
interest rates will start to rise slowly; but the relative lack of
inflationary pressure and hopes that President Clinton will be able to
reduce the budget deficit will prevent yields from rising substantially at
the long end of the market.
Last week also saw a revival of activity in the market for collared floating
rate notes - floating rate notes with minimum and maximum coupon levels. The
buyers of these notes have been largely continental European investors, keen
to lock in coupons of about 5 per cent, at a time when current money market
rates are more than 1 1/2 points lower. Since the market opened in July,
there has been more than Dollars 11bn of collared floaters in the dollar
market, as retail demand has vastly exceeded expectations.
In order to structure these transactions, the issuer sells a cap and buys a
floor, using the money raised by selling the cap to pay for the floor. When
the Treasury market falls, the value of the cap increases, making the
process more attractive to the issuer.
The flaw is that as soon as money market rates rise above 5 per cent, much
of the value of the paper will be instantly eroded, and investors may face
large capital losses.

FT  15 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Producer price index rise triggers
sharp reversal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS ONE particularly sagacious technical analyst on Wall Street pointed out
last week: 'A tree does not grow to the sky.'
This literary flight of fancy was meant to encapsulate the bond market's
recent performance. In less elegant terms, what the analyst implied was that
prices cannot go on rising for ever; what goes up, must come down. And the
bond market last week came down, in no uncertain terms.
The benchmark 30-year government issue tumbled almost 1 1/2 points on
Friday, pushing the yield up to 6.87 per cent at one stage. Over the week,
the yield rose about 20 basis points, 'bringing to an end a string of eight
consecutive weeks in which the long bond yield was lower on a
Friday-to-Friday basis,' noted Smith Barney's credit market analyst Mr Doug
Schindewolf.
Why the sudden turnround? The trigger for the dramatic sell-off was the
February producer price index, which rose 0.4 per cent during the month  - a
bigger increase than the market had expected. The rise in producer prices
was broad-based; everything from cars to capital equipment, tobacco and
household appliance prices rose significantly last month.
Moreover, the core rate of inflation - which excludes the volatile food and
energy components - has risen at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent so far this
year, not of itself desperately worrying but suggestive nonetheless of an
upward trend that could become dangerous if unchecked. Additionally, the
announcement of the PPI data came against a background of rising commodity
prices, and not too soon after the oil producing countries of Opec agreed to
cut production.
Comments on Friday afternoon from Mr Wayne Angell, the Federal Reserve
governor, to the effect that rising prices reflected economic growth that
was probably stronger than realised, did not help sentiment either.
Despite all this, the PPI figures and Mr Angell's remarks would not normally
have warranted such a dramatic reaction from bond investors were it not for
the fact that the bond market had grown too complacent about the inflation
threat. Consequently, the news on producer prices served to waken investors
from their slumbers with an overdue and not unwelcome shock.
No one, however, is ringing any alarm bells, at least just yet. While
describing the PPI report as 'one of the most disturbing we have seen in
months,' Nikko Securities chief economist Mr Bob Brusca believes that the
figures do not foreshadow a quickening in the pace of inflation. He says:
'Money growth trends are still down, worldwide growth is weak and the US
economy is again in more uncertain growth territory.'
Whether the bond market over-reacted to the PPI figures or not, there is no
doubting that this week's release of the consumer price index for February,
scheduled for Wednesday, will be more closely watched than ever.
If the CPI figure is at or above January's unexpectedly strong 0.5 per cent
increase, market sentiment is likely to take another turn for the worse.
Analysts, however, are predicting a rise in February consumer prices of
between 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent.
Their confidence that there will not be a repeat of January's figure is
based partly on the belief that that month's increase was fuelled by a
variety of temporary price pressures (such as a tobacco tax rise and the end
to airline fare breaks), and partly on a faith in historical precedence.
A look back over the past decade shows that consumer prices have risen
sharply in January, only to slow again in February. It is a phenomenon that
no one seems to have a particularly strong explanation for, other than to
blame it on adverse weather conditions.

FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Gilts: Pre-Budget nervousness is evident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gilts market is divided over the steps Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
should announce in his Budget speech tomorrow to tackle the rising public
sector borrowing requirement.
As Mr Lamont ponders the gap between public spending and borrowing, he is a
bit like a man with a festering boil. He is undecided on whether to leave
the deficit alone, or to administer surgery which could ultimately misfire.
The nervousness in the market before the Budget was evident last week.
Trading was volatile as many investors took profits after the run of several
weeks of falling yields at the long end of the market.
During the week, the short end of the market showed a small price rise, with
yields for five-year bonds falling by about 10 basis points to 6.4 per cent.
The move was more the result of technical switching down the yield curve
rather than any strong sentiment about an imminent fall in bank base rates,
now at 6 per cent.
Some gilt practitioners reckon that - even with the PSBR set to reach about
Pounds 50bn in 1993-1994 after a likely Pounds 37bn or so this year - Mr
Lamont should resist the temptation to tackle the deficit through fiscal
tightening. They reckon such a move would hit consumer and business
confidence, and deal a blow to recovery hopes. A new leg to the UK recession
could mean the deficit would go up even more over the next few years,
because of reductions in tax income and higher social security spending.
Another body of opinion thinks drastic action to curb the deficit is
necessary. According to this view, without a fiscal tightening the PSBR
could soar to Pounds 60bn to Pounds 70bn by the mid-1990s. That would
depress gilt prices because of the large volumes of bond issues which would
be necessary. This school of thought favours a large tax rise of some Pounds
5bn in the coming financial year, possibly accompanied by a cut in interest
rates to 5 per cent.
In between these two views is the position of Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK
economist at New York bank Goldman Sachs. He would like Mr Lamont to
announce a package of tax increases, but delay their implementation until
1994-1995. This, he reckons, would reassure financial markets of the
government's determination to reduce the PSBR, but stop short of damaging
short-term prospects for an upturn.
That argument fails to convince Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura, the
Japanese securities house. He thinks Mr Lamont should ignore the PSBR. 'The
Budget should be as boring as possible,' he says. 'History has shown that
bold budgets often do more harm than good.'
According to Mr Dillow's analysis, the PSBR will fall naturally as the
economy recovers - something he thinks is on course. That view is supported
by evidence such as last week's announcement by the Confederation of British
Industry that retail sales volumes in February showed strong year-on-year
growth for the second month running.
Mr Dillow says any increase in income tax or value added tax would increase
inflation, either because of the push these measures would give to wage
inflation or because of the direct impact on consumer prices. He thinks the
negative effects for gilt yields of a tax rise would more than offset any
immediate positive impact gained through reduced need for new bond issues.
Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at the capital markets division of
National Westminster Bank, says aside from any decisions over taxation the
gilt market would gain most satisfaction if Mr Lamont changed the funding
rules to allow purchases of gilts by bank and building societies to count
towards financing the PSBR.
He thinks the government would earn high marks by going back to broad money
targeting as a set of guidelines for economic management to replace the
discarded nostrums of the European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  15 MAR 93 / French Bonds: A signal from Germany more vital than poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of a general election should in theory cast a cloud of
uncertainty over the bond market, but, in practice, France's forthcoming
parliamentary elections have done nothing of the sort.
There are less than two weeks to go before the final round of voting in the
French elections. The conservative opposition has such a strong lead over
the ruling socialists in the opinion polls that a change of government seems
inevitable. But the right's economic policy is so similar to the left's that
the Paris bond market has been spared the usual spate of pre-election
nerves.
'The election isn't really a factor for the bond market,' said Mr
Francois-Xavier Chauchaud, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'The big
issue for French bonds is the same as always - interest rates.'
French bonds have been waxing and waning for months on speculation about
whether - or, more recently, when - the Bundesbank will signal a serious
reduction in German rates, thereby paving the way for the Bank of France to
cut French rates.
For the past two weeks the Paris market has been buoyed by a surge of
interest from international investors, particularly from the US, in the
expectation of action from the Bundesbank.
The market rallied again on Thursday, on the news of rate reductions in
Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands, only to waver on Friday when the
foreign exchange markets renewed their pressure on the franc.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bonds stood at 7.36 per
cent by the end of trading last week, against 7.28 per cent at the end of
the previous week and 7.78 per cent a month before.
However the spread between French and German bonds, which rose as high as
100 basis points earlier this year when the markets mounted another assault
on the franc, is still relatively steep at around 80 basis points.
Economists expect the spread to fall steadily after the elections, providing
interest rates come down. 'The medium term outlook for French bonds is
fairly promising,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, French economist at
Salomon Brothers. 'The Germans really must make significant cuts in interest
rates soon, not only because of their commitment to the European Monetary
System but also because of the growing pressures on their own economy.'
Mr Chauchaud of Banque Indosuez suspects the spread could fall as low as 50
basis points by mid-summer, by when he reckons the yield on 10-year OATs
should be 7 per cent. He expects a further fall in the spread from autumn
onwards as the effects of lower interest rates alleviate the strains on the
French economy.
However a lingering cause for concern is whether the next French government
will really be as stalwart as the socialists in its commitment to a strong
French currency. The joint manifesto of the RPR and the UDF says they will
be. Leading figures in both parties have dutifully pledged their support to
the franc fort policy.
The UDF is seen as much more solid on the currency front than the RPR, which
includes a number of outspoken right wingers, notably Mr Charles Pasqua and
Mr Philippe Seguin, who led the anti-Maastricht campaign in last autumn's
referendum and have since called for the devaluation of the franc.
The RPR has edged ahead of the UDF in the latest polls, thereby raising
fears that an RPR prime minister, such as Mr Edouard Balladur, finance
minister in the last conservative government, could come under pressure to
devalue from the Pasqua/Seguin faction.
'The bond market is waiting for firm proof that the right's campaign
promises will really become policy,' said Salomon's Mr Mercier. 'The new
government will have to act quickly to reassure the market or French bonds
could become very jittery.'

FT  15 MAR 93 / International Company News: Italy's final step to private
pension funds - The imminent move has already bolstered the stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost 11 years ago, Mr Enzo Berlanda, then a senator in the Italian
parliament and today chairman of Consob, the country's companies and stock
exchange watchdog, first drafted legislation for the creation of private
pension funds.
This month, the government gave the funds the green light, putting another
of the missing pieces of Italy's financial jigsaw into place and bringing
the country closer in line with its big European neighbours.
Although still to be debated in parliament, the government's decision to use
a decree law, by-passing lengthy discussion, means official approval for
pension funds could come as early as next month.
That has already bolstered the stock market, where the prospect of a large
injection of fresh institutional money has helped drive up prices.
The inauguration of private pension funds could also help the government's
ambitious privatisation programme. One of the main obstacles has been the
relatively small size and limited liquidity of the Milan bourse; any
increase in the amount of funds flowing into the market should smooth the
way for flotations or capital increases by cash-hungry state-owned
companies.
The new law has boosted insurance stocks in particular. They are seen as the
biggest potential beneficiaries from private pensions in view of their
actuarial expertise and existing know-how in life insurance.
Mr Angelo Marchio, managing director of RAS, is bullish about prospects.
'We're ready to go ahead as soon as the law is approved,' he says. RAS is
already active in pension or pension-related activities, by running pension
plans for some big private companies or through its own life insurance
policies for the public.
Like other insurers, Mr Marchio is keen for established insurance companies
to play a central role in running the new private pensions. Although some
details are still unclear, private pensions will be available in a variety
of ways. Individuals will be able to take out their own schemes, while
collective bodies, such as trade unions or professional associations, will
also be able to offer private pensions to members, as will smaller companies
which do not operate group pension schemes at present.
The insurers see a role both as agents, collecting and administering
premiums and pension payments on behalf of organisations running their own
schemes, and as principals, offering private pension plans directly to the
public.
Mr Marchio also expects insurers to be active in managing funds. While some
insurers might contract out administration to third parties, such as a bank
or a Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare, Italy's new brand of securities
house, others will manage the money internally. RAS is already one of
Italy's biggest institutional investors, with about L7,000bn (Dollars 4bn)
in the 13 investment funds it now administers.
Some observers have predicted that the arrival of private pension funds
could reshape Italian capitalism by creating a new source of long term risk
finance for the stock market. The new, professionally-managed money could
help to stabilise what is still a highly-speculative market and, some
believe, persuade more of the country's privately-owned companies to go
public.
However, both Mr Marchio and Mr Gianmario Roveraro, managing director of
Akros, a leading investment bank, are cautious as to whether pension funds
on their own will do all that is expected.
'Our priority will be to pay pensions, so the risks of our investments will
have to be examined very closely,' says Mr Marchio. 'If equities offer
acceptable dividend yields and potential capital gains, they would be an
obvious investment.' But he says pensions funds in particular, which need to
consider payment obligations well into the future, tend to require
carefully-balanced portfolios involving a wide variety of assets.
'First you have to ask how much new money might be available - one theory is
around L5,000bn a year,' says Mr Roveraro. 'Then you need to think how much
of that will go into shares rather than bonds.
'Even in countries, unlike Italy, where shares offer better yields than
bonds, and where the legislation covering the mix of pension fund
investments is relatively liberal, only a relatively limited proportion of
funds find their way into equities,' he cautions. 'I don't think the effect
on the bourse will be dramatic. I see pension funds as one of a variety of
measures which will help to create a bigger and more liquid equity market.'
Mr Roveraro thinks the biggest impact will be on the bond side, where the
new institutional money may help to deepen Italy's capital market by
creating a pool of cash for long-term corporate borrowing.
At present, long-term domestic bonds are dominated by the government, which
offers relatively high returns and tax incentives to entice private savings
into funding the budget deficit. That has crowded out big corporate
borrowers, which have been forced to use the Euromarkets, while smaller
companies have fallen back on bank lending.
The arrival of private pension funds, which are natural buyers of long-term
fixed-income securities, could help create a new long-term credit market,
thinks Mr Roveraro. Borrowers could either be companies, or one-off issuers
linked to essential public-works projects, such as new bridges or motorways.
'Why not issue a 25-year, index-linked security to fund a new highway
project, for which big insurance companies would be natural takers?' he
asks. Provided the new securities were granted equal treatment with
government bonds, the paper would be highly appealing to institutional
investors looking for fixed, inflation-protected returns, while broadening
Italy's capital markets as a whole.

FT  15 MAR 93 / International Company News: IRI in L340bn funding deal with
telecoms unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCREASINGLY serious financial crisis is forcing IRI, the principal
Italian state holding company, to squeeze funds for the second time in five
months from Stet, the cash-rich subsidiary controlling its
telecommunications holdings.
In an unprecedented move, IRI has reached provisional agreement to cede to
Stet for three years the dividend on 440m shares held in Comit, the
commercial bank.
Stet would in turn pay L340bn (Dollars 215m) in advance to IRI at the rate
of an average annual return of 23 per cent from the Comit shares. The return
on income has been computed to include a complex system of tax breaks.
The deal has yet to be formally approved by both parties but leaked details
were later confirmed by IRI.
Indeed, Stet management has already begun to defend what promises to be a
controversial arrangement at a time when the group needs heavy investment,
and is due to see IRI's 53 per cent controlling stake privatised.
IRI was already criticised last October for selling off to Stet for L671bn
control of Finsiel, its main software company.
Despite both sides claiming the sale represented a match of synergies,
analysts believed it was a means of IRI obtaining cash through the sale of
Finsiel shares at an advantageous price.
This reasoning led to an immediate 23 per cent fall in Stet shares which
only recovered after an extensive damage limitation exercise by the
management.
The latest arrangement bears all the hallmarks of dire necessity. IRI
management has suffered two major setbacks recently. The privatisation
process has proved slower than expected with deals such as the sale of its
foodstuffs and supermarket group, Sme, and its banking assets being behind
schedule.
More important, estimates of 1992 losses in Ilva, its steel arm, and in
Iritecna, civil engineering, have increased almost five times to total
L3,900bn.
While these losses need to be covered, IRI is also having to meet
obligations on its consolidated debt totalling L70,000bn.
The combination of these two elements is putting enormous strain on IRI's
financial resources, producing expedients like the proposal to cede
dividends rights in Comit to Stet. Over the weekend critics argued that the
Stet deal would not even ease the problems of Ilva and Iritecna losses.
Stet itself has to demonstrate its investments plans will not be affected by
the cash hand-out to IRI. The Stet case appears to rest largely on being
able to take advantage of take breaks on the deal.
In 1991 ENI, the state oil concern, a little noticed move ceded to a value
of lire 475bn dividend rights in its subsidiary Snam, to Agip its
exploration and production arm.

FT  15 MAR 93 / International Company News: Consortium to cover Comptoir's
urgent cash needs
</HEADLINE>

   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of financial institutions has agreed to cover the immediate
cash needs of Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, a French 145-year-old property
bank crippled by bad loans on commercial property, pending a FFr1bn (Dollars
176m) recapitalisation.
The Banque de France, the French central bank, said the main credit
institutions in Paris had agreed to refinance CDE's treasury needs, but did
not reveal their names or the amount. The move is the latest example of the
French financial authorities' strategy of trying to defuse the worst
financial impact of the Paris commercial property crisis, and as such is
likely to be welcomed by the market. CDE made a consolidated loss of just
over FFr1bn last year after heavy property write-downs.
CDE's shareholders, led by AGF, the state-owned insurer, are putting the
finishing touches to a FFr800m issue of fresh equity and FFr200m of
perpetual subordinated securities, to be presented at the next board meeting
on Wednesday. Other leading shareholders include Depfa, a German mortgage
bank, and UAP, the largest French state insurer.
The group was founded in 1848 to provide state-subsidised loans for cheap
housing but expanded into normal commercial and private property lending
after that role was wound down in 1984. It now has FFr10bn of risky loans to
property industry professionals, on which it has made FFr2bn of provisions.
CDE's management is urging the government to guarantee more of the group's
own borrowings, which it says is essential to restoring its credit rating.
Because of CDE's financial problems, the S&amp;P Adef French credit rating
agency recently lowered its ratings on CDE.
Currently, the state guarantees FFr34bn of CDE's debts, left over from its
old role as a financer of cheap housing, on top of which the group has
another FFr42bn of debt, including FFr28bn of property bonds. The government
has so far been cautious over extending this kind of support.

FT  15 MAR 93 / International Company News: Promodes ahead 19% in sluggish
retail sector

PROMODES, one of France's largest retail groups, managed to increase net
profits by 19.4 per cent to FFr555m (Dollars 98m)in 1992 from FFr465m in
1991 despite the slowdown in the French economy and the pressures on the
retail scene.
The group, already one of the largest participants in France's dynamic
hypermarket sector and which has recently been expanding its international
activities, notably with the 1991 acquisition of Plaza in Germany, saw
turnover rise by 10.3 per cent to FFr84.2bn last year from FFr76.37bn in
1991.
Last year the French retail sector came under pressure because of the
general strains on the French economy. The combination of high real interest
rates and fears of rising joblessness has depressed confidence and consumer
spending was static during the year.
Promodes produced a 32.5 per cent increase in operating profits to FFr1.76bn
in 1992 from FFr1.33bn in 1991.
The group said that it lost money on some of its new international
subsidiaries, but countered this with a strong performance from its existing
interests.
Earnings per share rose by 19.7 per cent to FFr33.5 last year from FFr28.0
in 1991. The board proposed raising the dividend by 20 per cent to FFr7 a
share for 1992.

from Wills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PLATON International, the USM-quoted instrumentation group fighting a
hostile Pounds 2.88m bid from Wills Group, has issued its formal defence
document urging shareholders to ignore Willis' 27p-a-share paper offer.
In its letter to shareholders the Platon board, led by Mr Robin Meyer,
chairman, again describes the Wills offer as 'wholly inadequate,' and urges
them to take no action on the bid.
Wills, an industrial, electronic and automotive products company, acquired
30,000 Platon ordinary shares (0.03 per cent) at 26 1/2 p each 10 days ago
and has received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from
shareholders holding a further 15.7 per cent.
The offer closes on Friday.

<TEXT>
Kosset Carpets, the biggest carpet manufacturer in the UK, has been bought
for an undisclosed sum by Shaw Industries of the US. Shaw, the largest
carpet manufacturer in the world, has no European manufacturing base.
Kosset emerged from the ruins of Coloroll, the home furnishings group run by
Mr John Ashcroft, which collapsed in 1989, via a Pounds 10m management
buy-out engineered by Kosset's chairman and chief executive, Mr John Parker.
Mr Parker will retain his position at Kosset.
Shaw has guaranteed the 720 jobs at Kosset's manufacturing plant in Bradford
and is expected to invest heavily in an expansion plan.

FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff launches bid for Aberdeen
Petroleum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITTENCRIEFF, the acquisitive Edinburgh-based oil and gas group, has
launched a conditional Pounds 7.5m all-paper offer for Aberdeen Petroleum
which is itself embroiled in a hostile takeover bid for fellow energy
explorer, Brabant Resources.
The company said its offer is conditional upon Aberdeen's bid for Brabant
not succeeding.
Under the terms of the bid Pittencrieff would swap two of its shares for
every 49 Aberdeen shares. Pittencrieff's stock closed at 356p on Friday and
the company claimed its offer values Aberdeen's shares at just over 14 1/2 p
each. Aberdeen's stock was unchanged at 15 3/4 p ahead of the announcement.
Pittencrieff said it was making the offer in order to further expand its oil
and gas development and production activities in the US and Canada where
Aberdeen's assets are mostly sited.
The bid was immediately rejected as 'totally inadequate' by Aberdeen, which
successfully fought off a takeover bid worth Pounds 5.5m from US rival
Bellwether Exploration in January before launching its own hostile all-paper
bid for Brabant last month.
Aberdeen claimed that the Pittencrieff bid represents a 47 per cent discount
to its net assets, and that its combined reserves with Brabant would be 2.5
times those of Pittencrieff. Mr David Hooker, Aberdeen's managing director
said: 'We remain convinced that the oil and gas sector should be
consolidated in order to add value for shareholders. However, Pittencrieff's
current offer completely fails to realise the full value of Aberdeen's
assets.'
Pittencrieff's move had been widely expected since the company acquired a
16.6 per cent equity stake in Aberdeen at the end of January - a stake which
has since grown to 19.1 per cent. The market has been expecting a
rationalisation of the smaller UK oil 'minnows'.
In support of its bid Pittencrieff claimed that its offer represented a 73
per cent premium over Aberdeen's closing price on January 8, the day before
Bellwether announced its abortive bid.

FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Company News: The risks of bluff and counter bluff - The
concern surrounding GPA's Dollars 5.5bn restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group's shareholders and its banks are involved in a game of bluff and
counter bluff.
At stake is the future of the aircraft leasing company which hopes to
complete its Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.87bn) restructuring by the end of the
month.
Lenders to GPA have made it clear that the restructuring is dependent on
investors taking part in a Dollars 200m rights issue of convertible
preference shares. But some shareholders are having difficulty in taking the
banks at their word. After all, what is Dollars 200m, asked one investor, to
a group with debts of Dollars 5.5bn?
Most of GPA's banks have already agreed to support its plan of halving its
borrowings over the next three years. GPA confidently expects others to
follow suit in the next few weeks.
The aircraft manufacturers have also agreed in principle to cancel or change
contracts, reducing firm orders for new aircraft from nearly Dollars 11bn to
between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn.
Having got this far, some shareholders doubt whether the banks would be
willing to jeopardise the company's survival by saying no to a restructuring
just because they failed to raise Dollars 200m.
The banks, however, say they could not be more serious in warning of the
dire consequences if shareholders do not come up with the cash. By not
taking up the convertible - which convert into shares at Dollars 1  - they
would be saying something about the perceived price of the shares which most
lenders do not want to hear.
As one of the bankers involved in the restructuring put it: 'If GPA's
investors do not think it is worth subscribing for new shares at Dollars 1,
with a yield of 7 per cent, then they are effectively saying they are not
worth anything.'
One of the group's US shareholders has already effectively said this by
writing off its entire GPA stake. Overseas Shipholding Group, one of the
biggest publicly-quoted bulk shiping companies with a market capitalisation
of Dollars 552m, is providing Dollars 13.1m against its GPA investment.
OSG reissued its fourth quarter results for 1992 to take the provision
retroactively. As a consequence its net income for last year fell from the
previously reported Dollars 29.1m to Dollars 16m.
Ms Catherine Mathis, director of OSG's corporate relations, said: 'The
write-off of our investment was based upon information that recently became
available'. Although she would not elaborate it is understood that the
company was referring to GPA's decision to price its convertible preference
shares at Dollars 1.
GPA's advisers have made it clear that the third attempt to raise cash in
less than a year is the last. It is not as if they could come back with yet
another proposed preference share issue with an even lower conversion price.
Nomura International, the Japanese investment house working on the
convertible, has told shareholders that without their participation the
banks will have no choice but to take effective control of the company. By
not underwriting the issue Nomura, which itself has 1.75m GPA shares bought
at an average of Dollars 20 a share, has made it clear that only
shareholders' involvement can ensure the company's survival.
If the group was forced to abort the rights issue its lead banks might look
at the possibility of reducing the burden of borrowings through a debt for
equity swap. But with more than 100 banks involved in the restructuring the
biggest lenders do not think they would stand a chance of winning approval.
Yet it is still not clear that investors will subscribe to the new shares.
Mr Jack Hersch, director of research at MJ Whitman, the Wall Street firm
specialising in bank debt trading, said: 'GPA's new shares are being sold as
an option on the basis that the company manages to survive without more
restructuring. The low option price signifies the low likelihood of
success.'
Nomura has accepted that around 80m of the shares will have to be marketed
to new institutions. But existing GPA shareholders will have to subscribe
for at least 120m new shares if the issue is to succeed.
The company must be hoping that a majority of its investors do not call the
banks' bluff by refusing to take part.

FT  15 MAR 93 / SE in move to sell information wholesale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange is close to contracting out its Topic information
system in a move designed to turn it into a wholesaler of stock market
information, rather than a retailer. Together with its desire to hand over
settlement to a new clearing house in the wake of the Taurus fiasco, this
would leave London with a slimmed-down stock market authority with
operations only around half of their present level.
The plan to contract out Topic, known within the exchange as 'Project
Jupiter', has replaced earlier moves to sell what is the leading carrier of
price information and news for the UK stock market. The exchange will
benefit from a royalty from future profits on Topic, and could eventually
sell it to the new operator.
Selling information and charging settlement fees last year contributed
Pounds 101m of the exchange's Pounds 194m of income. By largely pulling out
of these businesses, the institution - still reeling from its costly failure
to complete the Taurus automated settlement system - would fall back on
charging trading fees to its members and listing fees to companies.
The exchange intends to remain a low-cost wholesaler of share price
information. It is planning to spend Pounds 18m on a new 'ticker plant'  -
to take share price information from the market's central computers and
provide electronic information feeds to retailers such as Reuters and the
new Topic operator.
'The board has taken the decision to exit the end-user terminal business,'
said one director. 'The Topic base is under lots of pressure. Its system is
old hat now.' The exchange is currently upgrading the Topic system, and is
likely to want to continue to have an influence in its development once it
is contracted out.
Telerate, the US provider of financial information, is believed to be the
exchange's favoured contractor, although discussions are also continuing
with the Swiss-based Telecurs and at least two other companies.
In spite of the blow to the stock market's morale caused by the abandonment
of Taurus, believed to have cost the securities industry Pounds 400m or
more, the exchange seems likely to move ahead with another ambitious
technology project, to build a new trading system. This project, which is
estimated to cost the exchange Pounds 75m, has already been attacked by some
securities houses as a 'white elephant' on a par with Taurus. The exchange's
board plans to review the system again at its next board meeting in April.
Exchange chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, and directors contacted by the
Financial Times, all agreed that the so-called Technology Transformation
Project would have to proceed if London's dominance of share trading in
Europe was to be secured.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Search for glittering prizes beneath the Canadian ice:
Digging for diamonds in the frozen Northwest Territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anybody who works outdoors at this time of year in Canada's Northwest
Territories must have a very good reason. Temperatures plummet as low as
 400C, and feel even lower when fierce winds whip across the snow-covered
Arctic tundra. A shovel's metal blade becomes so brittle that it is liable
to snap when weight is put on it. Trucks and machinery must be kept running
around the clock to prevent their engines freezing.
A group of drillers and geologists employed by BHP, the Australian steel and
mining group, are braving these conditions on a frozen lake 310km north-east
of Yellowknife. Shielded from the wind by tarpaulins, they are working
12-hour shifts, day and night, around two 15-metre high drilling rigs. The
men have five days of emergency rations in case blizzards cut them off from
their base camp 4km away.
By the time the ice starts melting in late April, the drills will have
extracted 400 tonnes or more of kimberlite rock from beneath the lake, and
at least one other site nearby. BHP and its partners are confident that the
samples will contain enough high-quality gems to move towards construction
of North America's first diamond mine.
Mr Hugo Dummett, BHP Minerals' exploration manager in North America, says he
will be disappointed if a mine does not materialise. 'We're minimising our
chances of failure,' he says. BHP, which would have a 51 per cent stake in
the project, plans to spend at least CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.68m) on the
drilling programme this year.
Mr John Lydall, mining analyst at First Marathon Securities in Toronto, said
if a mine was built, it could supply about 7 per cent of the world's diamond
market.
The hunt for diamonds in the Northwest Territories has turned into one of
the biggest stampedes in North American mining history. Besides BHP, a
cluster of companies ranging from heavyweights such as De Beers and
Kennecott, to junior exploration outfits such as Kalahari Resources, have
staked claims covering 103,600sq km, an area about the size of Portugal. One
timber supplier in Yellowknife said it has sold 210,000 wooden stakes in the
past 12 months to mining companies, compared with 25,000 in a normal year.
The staking frenzy is reflected in the share prices of some of the players:
Dia Met Minerals, BHP's Canadian partner, now has a market value of almost
CDollars 450m, with its share price zooming up from less than a dollar in
late 1991 to CDollars 43 now. Two French banks, Societe Generale and Credit
Lyonnais, are in the process of buying CDollars 13m worth of Dia Met stock.
The story of diamond fever in the frozen north goes back to the early 1980s
when Mr Dummett, who then worked for Superior Oil, was tipped off by a bush
pilot that De Beers was prospecting along the Mackenzie River. Under cover
of darkness, Mr Dummett and Mr Charles Fipke, a Canadian geologist and Dia
Met's founder, landed a helicopter close to the De Beers camp and picked up
some samples.
Over the next few years, the search moved eastward towards the source of the
vast ice sheet which millions of years ago scraped up - and then deposited -
metal-bearing rocks across northern Canada.
The BHP-Dia Met joint venture, which was formed in 1990, made a breakthrough
in late 1991 in the Lac de Gras area, 350km east of the Mackenzie River.
Samples from a kimberlite pipe beneath Point Lake yielded 101 carats of
diamonds, equal to about 70 carats per 100 tonnes, which is well above the
grade normally required to justify a mine.
The purpose of this winter's drilling programme is to extract bigger samples
from other kimberlite pipes on BHP's 875,000 acre claim. The frozen samples
are transported by truck to a Dia Met processing laboratory in Colorado. The
results will be made known later this year.
BHP wants to have a sample of at least 2,000 carats before it decides
whether to press ahead with construction of a mine.
The partners are already confident that the quantity of diamonds in the Lac
de Gras kimberlite pipes is sufficient to support a mine milling around
10,000 tonnes of ore a day. Their optimism is based largely on the results
of research by Professor John Gurney, a geo-chemist at the University of
Cape Town.
Prof Gurney's theory, which appears to be supported by almost every diamond
discovery around the world, is that a kimberlite pipe is virtually certain
to contain diamonds if the purple-grey garnets in the pipe combine a high
chrome content with less than 4 per cent calcium. According to the BHP team,
the calcium content of the garnets found around Lac de Gras is 0.7 per cent
or lower.
What still remains to be established however, is the quality of the Lac de
Gras diamonds. According to Mr Fipke, 'we can predict diamond grades. But no
one can predict the per cent of gem quality.' Roughly one out of 200
kimberlite pipes contain diamonds, but only one in 20 of those has a high
enough proportion of gemstones to justify a mine.
The Northwest Territories diamond rush may yet come to naught. In spite of
the excitement, mining analysts caution that the shares of the companies
involved are for speculators only.
But if all goes well at Lac de Gras, BHP and its partners could have a mine
in operation by 1997 or 1998. They are unconcerned by the recent glut in the
world diamond market.
With many of the alluvial mines on the west coast of southern Africa as well
as the big Argyle property in Australia likely to run out of stones within
the next decade or so, the hope is that any new mines in the Northwest
Territories will come on stream at just the right time.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Lopez shuns VW by staying at GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUG-OF-WAR between General Motors and German rival Volkswagen over the
services of Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former head of worldwide
purchasing at the US carmaker, appeared resolved yesterday when GM said Mr
Lopez would not be leaving the company. A GM spokesman said: 'I can confirm
that he will be staying at GM.'
The announcement came just three days after Mr Lopez apparently delivered a
blow to GM by unexpectedly resigning his position. At the time, it was
reported that he was leaving to join the board of Volkswagen.
Reflecting VW's dismay at the decision, the German carmaker yesterday blamed
GM for putting pressure on Mr Lopez to stay. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chief
executive, said Lopez had come under 'persistent interventions' from GM
colleagues and the pressure for him to stay had proved impossible to resist.
Mr Lopez's decision to stay at GM will be a big boost to the US company. He
had been the key figure in a drive by GM to cut its costs through a radical
reorganisation in the way it buys parts in North America.
VW said that at Mr Lopez's request his contract of employment with VW, which
both sides had already signed, was to be set aside. Under the terms of the
contract, which was to have been ratified at a meeting of VW's supervisory
board tomorrow, Mr Lopez was to have started work at VW's Wolfsburg
headquarters within a matter of weeks. 'What was originally on the agenda
for (tomorrow's) board-meeting in relation to Mr Lopez is no longer on the
agenda,' said Mr Ortwin Witzel, VW press spokesman yesterday.
Mr Witzel said that both Mr Lopez and VW had agreed to talk about Mr Lopez's
future with the European company later in the year. This may 'perhaps' lead
to a decision to employ Mr Lopez later in the year, Mr Witzel said. It seems
unlikely, however, that Mr Lopez would continue to work at GM while
entertaining the possibility of moving to work for a competitor.
Mr Lopez is credited with giving GM's European operations the most
competitive cost structure of any European volume carmaker while VW labours
under probably the worst cost structure.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Economics Notebook: A map to put Sweden on the path to
recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sweden's political and economic woes were on full display last week, with
the government plunged into crisis over its budget proposals and a string of
large companies reporting huge losses. Aside from the risk of a summer
general election, which will take place if the government loses a confidence
vote on Wednesday, there is deepening gloom about the economy's prospects
for early recovery.
There could hardly have been a better time then for the independent panel of
economists, led by Professor Assar Lindbeck, to present its analysis of the
deep-seated problems in the Swedish economy. Commissioned by the government
in December, just three weeks after the government was forced to float the
krona, the report's task was to map out a course to sustainable economic
recovery.
It pulls few punches in its analysis of Sweden's economic plight. As
symptoms of the malaise, it cites a 10 per cent drop in industrial
production in 1990-91, an unemployment level of 12 per cent (if various
training schemes are included) and a budget deficit in the current fiscal
year of about SKr200bn (Pounds 18.2bn), or 13 per cent of GDP.
'We are in a very deep crisis and the worst lies ahead of us,' said
Professor Lindbeck, 'It will be a long and painful process before several
decades of mistakes and recklessness can be put to rights.'
The report is nothing if not comprehensive. It presents no fewer than 113
recommendations, calling for radical reform of the political and economic
system, and covering everything from income policy to lengthening the school
day. Although it gives some proposals more weight than others, it urges them
to be considered as a whole.
The banking crisis, the budget deficit and unemployment are identified as
top priorities. The commission broadly endorses Sweden's current monetary
strategy, calling for the central bank to continue its policy of cautiously
lowering interest rates, rather than adopting the UK approach of sharp and
rapid cuts. To follow the UK example, it says, would risk inflation and
reduced domestic demand.
But it is highly critical of current bank borrowing charges, which it says
are doing more to cripple small business than high money market rates. This
requires a quick resolution of the financial crisis, because banks are
charging borrowers high rates to rebuild capital bases ravaged by huge
credit losses. The shake-up requires new capital as well as new competition,
including from foreign banks. Where the state has to take over a bank, the
good and bad parts should be promptly separated, with the good part being
sold back to the market within a year.
As far as the budget deficit goes, the report warns that on current trends
Sweden's public debt: GDP ratio is set to reach 70 per cent by the turn of
the century. It therefore calls for further savings of up to SKr70bn in the
next five years to stabilise debt at 40-50 per cent of GDP by 1998. Most of
these savings would have to fall on the years from 1995 onwards, simply
because the economy is currently too weak to absorb more cuts. To help with
the savings programme, further reductions in Sweden's welfare payments are
proposed, including cuts to sickness and unemployment benefits.
High long-term unemployment is identified as the most serious risk for
Swedish society. But Professor Lindbeck also wants the country to get better
value for money out of the SKr90bn a year which it already spends on the
problem. That means cutting the pay within some schemes and shifting towards
less expensive programmes.
What the report does not recommend is any general reduction in Swedish tax
levels - significant in that this was an important plank of policy when the
centre-right minority coalition government, under prime minister Mr Carl
Bildt, came to power in 1991. But the omission only emphasises the
seriousness of the country's financial position, which has already forced
the Bildt government to abandon its tax-cutting plans.
The commission is as insistent on the need for political reform as it is for
economic change. It calls for an extension of government's current
three-year mandate period, fewer MPs and standing committees, a
strengthening of the budget process and reduced interest group influence
over policy. It presents a timetable for very little of the package, but
makes it plain that time is not on Sweden's side.
Professor Lindbeck is a respected economist both at home and abroad, as well
as being the head of the committee which chooses Nobel Prize winners in
economics. There is no doubt that his views carry weight. But will they be
implemented?
Officially, the report now goes out to consultation to give a wide range of
different organisations the opportunity to present their comments before it
is reconsidered by the government later in the year. Unofficially, the
government is free to act on its recommendations much earlier, possibly
incorporating some of them in next month's supplementary budget.
Most of Sweden's leading economists believe the report comes up with the
right measures to revitalise the country's economy. The reception given to
it by politicians and various interest groups last week was predictably more
mixed. The government was certainly enthusiastic, saying it provided strong
support for its existing policies. Even the opposition Social Democrats
appeared to go along with much of it, although they did not like what it had
to say about labour market reform. Only the unions appeared to be overtly
hostile.
One danger is that only the 'easy' parts of the programme will be
implemented, not the painful ones. Another is that the recommendations are
not carried out as swiftly as the commission feels they should be.
A more immediate risk, however, is that the current political turmoil will
distract attention away from proper consideration of the document. Given the
extent of Sweden's economic difficulties, the country can ill afford three
months of uncertainty which a summer election would entail.

FT  15 MAR 93 / GPA seeks outside investors for share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP is looking for outside 'strategic investors' to take up to 40 per
cent of the Dollars 200m convertible preference share issue necessary for
its survival.
Nomura International, the Japanese securities house, the aircraft leasing
company's leading adviser on the rights issue, has told it that its existing
shareholders are unlikely to subscribe more than 120m of the 200m
convertibles on offer. These effectively value the shares at Dollars 1,
compared with a price less than a year ago of Dollars 30.
Nomura has asked shareholders to give indicative responses before Friday,
when the group's temporary waivers of the banking covenant breaches expire.
According to one of GPA's banks, around 80 per cent of the group's lenders
have agreed to the Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.8bn) debt restructuring
proposals, but only on condition that the preference issue takes place.
The company needs the debt restructuring to be completed soon so that it can
raise finance in the bond markets.
Many of GPA's shareholders have indicated that they are unlikely to take
part in the issue unless an outside institution invests in the company.
Shareholders are also watching whether the company's four biggest investors,
with 35 per cent, support the issue. One shareholder said: 'Everyone is
waiting to see how the big four jump. No one wants to be first to put up any
money.'

FT  15 MAR 93 / Embattled Yeltsin weighs options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian President, retreated to his country dacha
yesterday to consider his political future following his bruising battle
with the country's supreme parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies.
Government sources yesterday said Mr Yeltsin had little choice but to
proceed with a controversial referendum or plebiscite on the country's
constitutional future, in the face of congressional opposition.
Many of Mr Yeltsin's radical ministers are in favour of the declaration of
presidential rule, and the carrying of their campaign to reform the economy
to the country. However, the powerful heads of Russia's regional
authorities, who would normally organise the holding of a referendum and who
have already expressed their opposition to it, are now increasingly
sceptical of the president's authority.
Senior US administration officials have suggested that the US would not
formally object if Mr Yeltsin resorted to special powers, including the
suspension of the parliament, but would draw the line at a military
crackdown.
The Congress, led by Mr Yeltsin's rival Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, ended a
stormy session on Saturday after voting which appeared to give it the upper
hand in the struggle with the president over who rules Russia.
On Saturday the Congress adopted a resolution condemning the President for
'adventurism' and has asked the smaller Supreme Soviet to vote on further
limits on presidential power, on early elections, and on parliamentary
control of television, radio and the main news agency Itar-Tass.
Mr Yeltsin is expected to address the country today, although the main
television channel has been on the alert for such a broadcast since Friday,
when he strode out of the Congress after it defeated his request for an
April referendum.
Russia yesterday urged the Group of Seven industrialised countries to target
their aid in such a way that Mr Yeltsin's reforms could be seen to be
working, said officials close to a G7 'sherpas' meeting in Hong Kong.
G7 officials said Russian deputy prime minister Mr Boris Fyodorov's message
was well received by the meeting, the first gathering of 'sherpas' before
the G7 Tokyo Summit in July. One European official noted: 'Balance of
payments support and debt relief do not translate into things people can
see.'
However, officials said they would have to report back to respective
governments and take account of an International Monetary Fund investigation
of the Russian economy, under way in Moscow, before any concrete initiatives
could be contemplated.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Lamont to act on project funding: Budget statement likely to
ease logjam on private-sector financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to act in tomorrow's Budget
statement to answer concern in the construction and banking sectors that the
Treasury has been slow to approve projects involving private sector
investment in public sector projects.
He is widely expected to refer to the Pounds 300m plan by British Rail and
BAA, the airports operator, to build an express rail from London to Heathrow
airport. He may announce other projects.
Construction companies and investment bankers have become frustrated by the
length of time it is taking to get projects approved, and are concerned that
there is a gulf between the Treasury and potential investors over what
should constitute a reasonable balance between risk and reward.
Officials and ministers outside the Treasury are irritated that despite
fresh impetus given to the initiative by Mr Lamont in the public spending
statement last November, little progress has been made on schemes which have
been put forward.
They accept that the new Treasury guidelines on private finance were
published only in December, but believe some suggestions are being dismissed
without being given proper consideration.
In particular, there is concern over the Birmingham western orbital toll
road, where the government has indicated that it might allow joint funding
arrangements. The four interested consortia say they have been waiting for
specific proposals since the autumn statement.
Mr Patrick de Pelet head of project finance at Kleinwort Benson merchant
bank, said: 'There is a lack of momentum and a danger that companies which
have invested large sums of money gaining experience and building up teams
could become disenchanted.
'A lot of other countries are looking to finance infrastructure investment
privately. British companies and banks have a good track record in this
field and it is important that this reputation be maintained. Opportunity
for much needed infrastructure at home and export orders abroad, could be
lost.'
Mr John Hackett, director general of the Federation of Civil Engineering
Contractors, said the industry had appeared to be making real progress when
the Treasury published its guidelines permitting private companies and
public authorities to invest jointly in projects.
'Since then there have been plenty of suggestions but no real progress. It
is not clear who is in charge of the private finance initiative.'
The Treasury vehemently rejects this criticism, emphasising that talks are
progressing on how the initiative might apply in the health and prison
services and that some Scottish schemes, including a proposal for a
privately financed Forth road bridge, have been announced.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Jobseekers over the hill at 45, says survey of
advertisements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   IF YOU'RE over 45, don't bother to apply
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that is the message from UK employers to jobseekers, according to an
analysis of more than 4,000 job advertisements.
Almost a third of advertisers specified an age bar, an increase from a
quarter four years ago when the independent research group, Industrial
Relations Services, last monitored job advertisements. Four out of five
employers giving an age preference wanted someone under 45.
Even companies describing themselves as 'equal opportunity' employers in job
advertisements appeared willing to exclude some candidates on the grounds of
age.
IRS cites a Nissan Motor (GB) advertisement for a personnel controller and a
management development controller where the 'successful candidates will be
aged about 25', Pearl Assurance wanted a training manager 'in their early to
mid-thirties' and Group Four Total Security was looking for a 'personnel
professional aged 25-40'.
The Institute of Personnel Management strongly discourages members from
imposing age bars.
In a guidance note it states: 'It does not make good business sense
deliberately to exclude suitably qualified candidates on the basis of age.'
Although 1993 is the European Year of Older People, a recent European
Commission advertisement spotted by IRS insisted that candidates for the job
of administrative assistant should 'have been born after October 9 1956'.
The Commission's justification is that it wants to hold on to employees for
several years.

FT  15 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow's meeting of Volkswagen's supervisory board will reveal how far the
company is prepared to go to catch up speedier rivals. Although VW's
consensual style enabled it to grow into the biggest European car
manufacturer, it has lately stifled its response to the industry's
rapidly-changing dynamics. VW's failure to change out-dated working
practices has left it perilously exposed as Europe's car market lurches
downwards. Its European sales could fall by 340,000 units this year.
VW's new chief executive, Mr Ferdinand Piech, has signalled a fearsome
intent to tackle VW's problems head-on. He has been assembling a strong
management team, although the last minute failure to appoint Mr Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, who was credited with turning round General Motors'
European operations, is a big setback. There may be old-guard departures at
senior level, but what matters most tomorrow is whether Mr Piech can at last
produce a concrete plan for quickly cutting labour costs. Only that will
show whether he has persuaded the trade union and regional government
officials on VW's board of the need for drastic redundancies. The sense of
crisis at VW may be his greatest ally.
Unlike many of its rivals, VW's balance sheet is in reasonable shape. German
car sales may fall 20 per cent this year, but they would still exceed those
of 1990. Having already come to terms with the prospect of a dividend cut,
the stock market may be right in anticipating better times ahead.

FT  15 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The exodus of Names from the Lloyd's insurance market has squeezed the
agencies which stand between them and underwriters. Sturge and A J Archer,
the two quoted agencies, underperformed the stock market by 90 per cent over
the last five years. Their response to plunging commission income has been
consolidation: witness last week's acquisition by Archer of the unquoted
Castle Holdings. The deal allows Archer to spread the cost of developing
technology for analysing the performance of underwriting syndicates. If the
reforms under consideration allow companies to commit capital to Lloyd's,
such expertise may be a matter of survival.
But there are pitfalls in empire-building. In a litigious business like
Lloyd's, acquiring other agencies - contingent liabilities and all - can be
risky. Big agency groups must also be wary of conflicts of interest. Both
Archer and Sturge now own managing agents which act for underwriters, and
members' agents which represent the interests of Names. The last round of
Lloyd's legislation stopped insurance brokers owning managing agents. The
coming proposals may demand a root and branch reform.
So long as the market is shrinking, though, Lloyd's agencies will be under
pressure to take out costs. That points to further mergers. Sturge and
Archer can pay for unquoted rivals with quoted paper. Consolidation alone
will not bring a reversal of fortunes. That requires a return to
underwriting profits. But whatever structure emerges for Lloyd's, the strong
will be best placed to benefit.

FT  15 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is a case for breaking up British Gas into many competing
companies, Sir James McKinnon has not made it. Ofgas's submission to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission was long on diagrams but short on numbers
and its protestations that the proposed structure would cost only Pounds
250m a year look implausible. Equally, British Gas has failed to persuade
that it deserves to be preserved as a 'national champion'. Its arguments
that a break-up would be unsafe and an administrative nightmare are thin and
self-serving. British Gas has a nasty history of championing the status quo
in the interests of British Gas.
So it sticks in the craw to go along with the company. Yet with the
advantages of a break-up highly uncertain there is a case for settling
nearer the company's position than Sir James's. Some of the nastier
political questions - such as the obligation to supply small consumers that
no-one really wants - might be avoided. A tight price cap will squeeze costs
out of the business. Stronger Chinese walls within the company would make it
easier to break up later if insufficient competition flows through.
On one issue, however, everyone seems to be wrong. Cheap interruptible gas
supplies to large industrial customers are really needed because of
variations in demand from domestic users. The costs and benefits should be
considered together and priced against the alternative of increased storage
capacity.

FT  15 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: The franc marks time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the doom-mongers were to be believed, we should have been in the middle
of another ERM crisis now that the French election is approaching. That the
strains on the system have been limited is in part due to the troubles of Mr
Boris Yeltsin which have conveniently depressed the D-Mark. Some pressure on
the franc has been masked by intervention, particularly on Friday morning.
Above all, expectations of a cut in Germany's official interest rates have
held the more timid speculators at bay. That means, though, that this
Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting has assumed increased importance
whether the bank likes it or not.
Some recent statements from bank officials suggest it regards the quarter
point cut in its money market repurchase rates as enough for the time being.
But, given expectations this cut has engendered, the disappointment if there
is no follow-through would be significant. The bank would be sending a
powerful signal that it would only cut rates slowly despite the
deterioration in the German economy.
That could immediately expose the French currency to speculative pressures
that are currently more repressed than cured. It might also revive the
debate over how long other ERM countries can survive with real interest
rates far too high for the good of their economies. Last week again saw
rumblings of concern in Portugal and Spain, while it is striking that, even
after devaluation, Ireland still has to endure short-term interest rates of
11.5 per cent. It was always the case that the clouds over the ERM would
lift only when the Bundesbank finally took decisive action on rates. It has
not done so yet.

BLACKSTONE GROUP, the New York investment bankers, has dropped its CDollars
1.03bn (USDollars 828m) offer for all the shares of Univa, Canada's second
biggest food distributor.
The bid, set at CDollars 11 per Univa share, was structured so that a new
company 80 per cent owned by Blackstone and 20 per cent by Montreal
entrepreneur Mr Bertin Nadeau would have merged with Univa.
Mr Nadeau, who owns 26 per cent of Univa and is its largest single
shareholder, would then have had a 20 per cent stake, with the option of
buying back control within seven years.
The Caisse de Depot, the CDollars 41bn Quebec public pension fund which owns
17 per cent of Univa, objected saying the merger would have doubled Univa's
debt to CDollars 1.25bn, endangering its future survival. All shareholders
were not being treated in the same way and CDollars 11 a share was too low,
it said.

FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: American Express in Dollars 1bn
disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AMERICAN EXPRESS, the troubled financial services and travel group,
yesterday formally announced the Dollars 1bn sale of the retail broking and
asset management businesses of its Shearson Lehman arm to Mr Sandy Weill's
Primerica financial services group.
The deal will lead to the creation of Smith Barney Shearson after Primerica
merges its Smith Barney securities subsidiary with Shearson. The combined
entity will have more than Dollars 112bn of assets under management, 10,500
brokers and almost 500 branch offices.
As a result Mr Weill is now in a position to challenge Merrill Lynch's
position as the leading US brokerage house.
The deal will cause first quarter write-offs at American Express of about
Dollars 730m for transaction-related costs such as severance, relocation and
systems modifications plus a write-down of Dollars 750m in Shearson's
goodwill.
American Express stressed that the first-quarter losses it expects to suffer
on the Shearson deal would be offset in part by the previously announced
plan to sell The Boston Company for Dollars 1.47bn and anticipated gains
from the sale of Dollars 1bn of stock representing majority control of First
Data Corporation, the group's data processing subsidiary.
The Shearson takeover was hailed on Wall Street yesterday as a coup for Mr
Weill, who built Shearson in the 1970s and sold it to American Express in
1981 for Dollars 900m. Following this deal, Mr Weill became the president of
American Express, only to resign in 1985.
The 59-year-old Mr Weill, who yesterday named Mr Frank Zarb, Smith Barney's
chairman, to head the new brokerage house, has agreed to pay American
Express Dollars 850m in cash, Dollars 125m in Primerica convertible
preferred stock and Dollars 25m in Primerica common equity warrants.
In addition, Primerica will pay American Express future contingent amounts
based on the new unit's performance - up to Dollars 50m a year for three
years plus 10 per cent of after-tax profits that exceed Dollars 250m a year
over the next five years.
Primerica will finance the deal by issuing Dollars 550m of new debt
securities and Dollars 500m of equity-equivalent securities.
Lehman Brothers is not part of the Primerica deal, but American Express said
yesterday that among its options would be a public share offer of Lehman
stock.
Shearson Lehman last year suffered Dollars 116m of losses. Smith Barney last
year had Dollars 170.1m of earnings.
Mr Harvey Golub, the American Express chief executive who took over last
month after the departure of Mr James Robinson, yesterday moved quickly to
outline a new group strategy that will focus on a leaner business based on
its three main subsidiaries.

FT  13 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Claim for discount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 20th March 1993) appended to this article.
MY WIFE owns a small cottage which is registered in her name. I believe she
is entitled to a 50 per cent council tax discount on it as 'a second home.'
But the local authority claims that 'a property which is not a sole or main
residence but is furnished will not be subject to a discount,' according to
a decision taken by the council. This appears to contravene the literature
published by the Department of the Environment?
While you would be entitled to a rebate on an empty property (for up to six
months), the property is not regarded as empty while it remains furnished;
hence, the council would appear to be correct. This is not a decision 'taken
by the council' but an application of the rules which govern the new council
tax.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
CORRECTION
The owner of a second home in England or Scotland will be entitled to a 50
per cent discount from the council tax. Special rules applying in Wales mean
that the district council can decide whether to apply a discount of 50 per
cent, or 25 per cent, or none at all. An answer published last week about
this issue was incorrect.

FT  13 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sears easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long-standing rumours that the Fayed brothers might be seeking to place
their 10.5 per cent stake in Sears, the high street retailing group,
resurfaced yesterday. Dealers reported that one leading securities house had
been approaching institutions in what seemed to be a pre-placing exercise.
Some market traders believed the Fayed Brothers, owners of the House of
Fraser group, want to use the proceeds of a Sears placing to fund a hotel
building programme. The share price weakened 2 to 97p in turnover of 2.4m.
However, analysts were somewhat dismissive of the reports, largely on the
grounds that the Fayeds, who paid around 140p apiece for their shares six
years ago, would be unlikely to accept such a large loss. A spokesman for
House of Fraser also dismissed the rumour, asserting that the Fayed brothers
remained long-term investors in Sears. No one was available for comment at
Sears.
A substantial and unreservedly bullish research document from BZW, joint
broker to Zeneca, the intended pharmaceutical arm of the demerged ICI,
helped drive shares in the blue chip chemical group sharply higher in an
otherwise depressed stock market. The shares also benefited from impact of
several institutional presentations by ICI itself.
Income funds were also said to have been supporters of the shares which go
ex the 34p dividend on Monday.
The BZW health and household team described the Zeneca demerger from ICI as
a 'bold initiative, already benefiting shareholders and company alike, the
former from a steadily rising share price as demerger benefits unfold, the
latter from a sharper management focus'. ICI closed 9 higher at 1272p.
The market was caught on the wrong foot by Pilkington's purchase of Heywood
Williams' glass merchanting business. Dealers had braced themselves for a
series of profits downgrades earlier in the week after Pilkington called in
a number of selected analysts for a briefing.
The deal was accompanied by Heywood's preliminary figures, showing a steep
decline in profits but a maintained dividend. The market's reaction was to
mark Heywood shares sharply higher on the view that the board had achieved a
good price for the assets. They closed a net 53 higher at 239p after
turnover of 4.7m shares. Pilkington closed 7 higher at 108p on turnover
6.5m.
Shares in Thorn EMI weakened for a second session as rumours of problems
with one of its US subsidiaries combined with some technical selling
pressure. There were suggestions from New York that an official inquiry
might be launched into Rentacentre, Thorn's US subsidiary. The company rents
and sells white goods, but, according to analysts, has come in for criticism
over disclosures to potential customers of rates and terms. The shares
closed 8 adrift at 853p.
The steep fall on the Hong Kong market upset HSBC, which was also affected
by a bout of nervousness ahead of Monday's preliminary figures. It dropped
37 to 604p. Cable &amp; Wireless dipped 10 to 713p. Inchcape fell 26 to 583p.
Around 32 per cent of the company's 1991 earnings came from the Far East.
Standard Chartered on the other hand, rallied strongly from an initially
depressed 694p to close a net 11 higher at 714p.
Bass rebounded from its recent underperformance as Kleinwort Benson turned
from seller to hold.
Activity in the traded options market focused interest on Forte as one
institution decided that the hotel group's results next month could prompt a
volatile time for the shares. Forte was the top traded option, with the
equivalent of over 3m shares traded. In the equity market, the shares shaded
3 to 203p in turnover of 3.3m.
In a largely resilient stores sector, Storehouse responded to positive
pressure from NatWest Securities, the shares up 2 to 192p.
Hopes of debt restructuring plans boosted ADT and the shares put on 25 to
463p.
Among engineering and aerospace stocks, TI Group, which raised the dividend
this week as it reported figures, was in demand and the shares added 5 to
321p in trade of 4.4m.

property developer

<TEXT>
A NEW YORK bankruptcy judge yesterday turned over The New York Post, the
loss-making tabloid newspaper, to Mr Abe Hirschfeld, a local property
developer, following a four-hour court hearing.
The hearing had been called to discuss the finances of Mr Steven Hoffenberg,
the owner of a debt collection agency who for the past few weeks has seemed
ready to take over the newspaper.
After more than a dozen lawyers appeared and the court was rocked by
frequent laughter, Judge Francis Conrad ruled that Mr Hirschfeld was in a
better financial position to save the newspaper, which has run out of
operating capital.
Mr Hoffenberg, who was earlier viewed as the paper's saviour, has had
problems lately in the wake of a legal victory by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC accused Mr Hoffenberg of fraud and won
control of Towers Financial, a company he controls.

UPJOHN, the US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday received a favourable

writes Karen Zagor in New York.
A jury in Texas found no liability on the part of Upjohn or its
co-defendant, a physician who prescribed the product. In the case Mr William
Harley alleged he had been stabbed by an assailant acting under the
influence of the drug.
Halcion was banned in the UK last year. Sales have fallen sharply, although
it still has approval for US marketing.

A COURT in New York has dismissed Olympia &amp; York's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
case, allowing its Canadian restructuring to be consummated by the March 15
deadline, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
O&amp;Y will now emerge from Canadian bankruptcy court protection. O&amp;Y had filed
for US Chapter 11 protection in respect of certain US properties. It later
asked the court for a dismissal to satisfy creditors.
In Canada a court-appointed administrator will now take charge of the
property company and an unsecured creditors' monitoring committee will
assume its duties.
O&amp;Y's Canadian creditors had refused to consummate the Canadian
restructuring while the US Chapter 11 case was outstanding. In Canada
creditors are already seizing O&amp;Y buildings to satisfy debt and the
Reichmanns have already ceded operating control.

<TEXT>
LONDON Electricity yesterday became the first of the privatised electricity
companies to withdraw completely from retailing. It announced a management
buy-out of part of its loss-making retail business and closure of the rest.
The Pounds 6m buy-out, headed by Mr Clive Vlotman, London Electricity's
retail operations controller, will cover 66 of the company's 96 retail units
 -19 stores and 47 retailing concessions granted to Debenhams, the high
street retailer. Capita Corporate Finance is providing the funding.
Of the remaining stores, 17 will close and 13 will be converted to customer
service centres, to add to the 18 centres already operating.
London Electricity's 1992-93 results will show an exceptional charge of
about Pounds 20m to cover the cost of the withdrawal, including a write-off
of fixed assets and a discount to the MBO for existing stock.
In 1991-92 the retail business incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11m on
turnover of Pounds 33m. Interim results for this year included a Pounds 4m
pre-tax loss on retailing before pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.3m on all
activities.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Fishermen blockade port to repel French trawler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRENCH trawler was last night prevented from entering Milford Haven
harbour in west Wales when three trawlers blockaded the entrance and warned
that no French boat would be allowed into the port.
The French trawler was forced to remain at anchor outside the harbour last
night, unable to land her cargo.
More British boats are expected to join the blockade in time for high tide
this morning when another French trawler is expected at Milford Haven with a
cargo of fish. Trawlermen are protesting at the effect of imports on local
prices and claim that some of the French fish landed at the Welsh port are
re-exported to France.
Jimmy Burns writes: Earlier yesterday fishermen's leaders called for a
European Community import ban on Russian cod but held back from supporting a
blockade of ports.
Officials of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which
represents most fishermen in England and Wales, called for the ban at a
meeting in Grimsby, where fishermen this week stopped lorries from
delivering Russian fish to the local market.
The UK Association of Frozen Food Producers yesterday warned that any import
ban could lead to a shortage of fish by the summer.
Mr Geoffrey Molloy, the association's chairman, said: 'Banning cod imports
will not help the consumer and will certainly not help prices. The increases
in landings which the fishermen complain about are, in fact, caught by UK
fishermen themselves.'
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said yesterday the
government would not back the fishermen's call for a ban at next week's EC
council of fisheries ministers.

FT  13 MAR 93 / New facts in hunt for Salvation Army cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLICITORS acting for the Salvation Army were yesterday studying new
information as part of their efforts to recover more than Pounds 6m
allegedly missing from the charity's funds, Jimmy Burns writes.
The information is contained in the form of an affidavit signed by Mr Mark
Duffy which was handed to Slaughter &amp; May, the army's solicitors, prior to a
High Court hearing yesterday.
The hearing was related to a court order under which Mr Duffy and 14
defendants named in a writ were required to disclose information relating to
the whereabouts of the sum of Dollars 8.8m, formerly standing in an account
held at Banque Continentale du Luxembourg.
Mr Mark Duffy was named in the writ because of his association with Mr
Stuart Ford, a Birmingham-based businessman who is alleged to have conspired
to defraud the Salvation Army. There is no claim of wrongdoing against Mr
Duffy.
In his affidavit Mr Duffy blames his failure to submit information earlier
to the Salvation Army on the fact that he had temporarily had to leave the
country to avoid the attentions of the media.

VENEZUELA'S attorney general has asked the Supreme Court to rule whether
President Carlos Andres Perez can be charged with fraudulent use of Dollars
17m (Pounds 11.9m) in government funds.
The attorney general, Mr Ramon Escovar Salom, asserted in documents filed
with the High Court that Mr Perez and two former ministers misused funds
from a secret state account managed by the president, the minister of the
interior and a limited group of high officials.
However, the constitutional grounds for such unprecedented action in
pressing criminal charges against a sitting president are not clear in
Venezuela.
Mr Perez began his five year presidential term in February 1989.

A council resolution, passed unanimously, 'strongly condemns' violations by
Unita of peace accords, its failure to take part in political institutions,
its withdrawal from the new Angolan armed forces and 'its seizure by force
of provincial capital and municipalities'.

FT  13 MAR 93 / German leaders struggle towards solidarity pact

<TEXT>
AS SPRING sunshine broke through the winter gloom of Bonn yesterday, the
entire German political establishment was locked away behind the closed
doors of the chancellor's office, searching for signs of daylight in the
fine detail of their 'solidarity pact' for east Germany.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with a string of top government ministers, the
leaders of all the main parliamentary parties, the 16 prime ministers of the
federal states, and their finance ministers and advisers, agreed to carry on
negotiating in working groups all evening, and meet again today, in an
attempt to forge the political consensus they have been seeking since last
September.
A formula has to be found to finance a spending gap of DM110bn (Pounds
46.6bn) in 1995 to pour more money in-to the collapsed eastern economy.
The signs last night were that there was clear movement towards a political
compromise, although the final figures - at least on the burden sharing -
may take a little longer to agree. The opposition Social Democrats, led by
Mr Bjorn Engholm, prime minister of Schleswig-Holstein, have won the first
key battle to block any big cuts in social spending.
Instead, they have agreed on a campaign to clamp down on unemployment and
social security swindles, and to identify further savings of more than DM3bn
in other parts of the budget.
The other main move was a concession to the new states of east Germany for
the government to shoulder a share of their DM51bn housing debt, thus
freeing the way for faster privatisation of the dilapidated state-owned
housing stock.
What remains are the toughest nuts of all to crack:
When and by how much to raise taxes through a new 'solidarity surcharge': Mr
Kohl is adamant it must not come before 1995, and the SPD looking for a tax
rise this July.
How to split up the whole burden between the budgets of the federal
government and the 16 Lander, and share the pain between the rich states and
the poor.

FT  13 MAR 93 / West ponders how to aid Russia: Tight economic policies
needed to stop waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS President Boris Yeltsin's political troubles help focus western minds on
the need to accelerate assistance for his economic reforms, the question of
how to deliver help becomes more urgent than ever.
One reason why the west has not produced large-scale finance for Russian
economic reform is because of doubts that it would achieve its purpose. The
banking and distribution systems are extremely primitive, capital flight and
corruption are big problems, and the bureaucracy is slow and inept.
Even Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for economics and finance
who arrives in Hong Kong today for talks with the Group of Seven
industrialised countries, agrees that stopping aid from being wasted is the
biggest headache. Without tight economic policies, all would be lost.
The stakes are high. If the aid does not reach its targets, the risk of a
political backlash against reform in Russia is heightened. If aid is not
controlled, it might just provide a financial cushion to delay reform.
There is also pressure for aid to go beyond new loans. Much of the Dollars
24bn (Pounds 17bn) package promised by the west last year was limited to
loans guaranteed by western governments for imports of western goods and
equipment. A new emphasis would target western cash at projects to show
concrete benefits and even help Russia generate hard currency.
The World Bank would lead such efforts, which include, for example, a plan
to finance equipment to cap gas flares in Russia's oil industry.
This thinking is even being applied to the International Monetary Fund, last
year charged with administering western financial assistance to Russia in
return for reforms which never materialised.
Diplomats say the G7 is now considering the creation of a special fund, to
be run by the IMF, to finance specific programmes. One - approved by the
Russian premier, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin - would organise five model
bankruptcies in key sectors. This would send a warning to enterprises
squandering state support and instruct officials and judges on how to
implement Russia's first bankruptcy law in 70 years.
Another idea is for the IMF to take on the burden of subsidies at present
provided by Moscow to the former Soviet republics through the issue of
credits from the Russian Central Bank. Mr Fyodorov says that last year
Russia spent the equivalent of Dollars 18bn subsidising the former
republics.
Technical assistance might also draw more on examples which have worked well
so far. One model is the work of the International Finance Corporation, the
World Bank's private sector development arm, which is working in the
provinces to help local authorities privatise shops, big enterprises, and
even land.
Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, who last year headed a government commission to fight
corruption until it was disbanded, suggests that plants equipped with
western machinery but not completed under inefficient state management
should simply be given to western companies. Completed and run by
westerners, they would provide models of efficiency and jobs.

SHELLING by Serbs killed and wounded a number of women and young children
blockading British soldiers in a Moslem village in east Bosnia yesterday,
Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
Major Martin Waters, at the headquarters of the British UN battalion in
Vitez, central Bosnia, said two doctors were performing operations on the
victims without the use of anaesthetic. 'There are quite a few dead, and six
children under five were seriously injured, two with their legs blown off.'
Five British soldiers are being held hostage in the besieged village of
Konjevic Polje by Moslems demanding a ceasefire, the stationing of UN
monitors in the region and humanitarian aid.
The soldiers, in two armoured cars, were escorting a UN medical convoy to
Konjevic Polje on Thursday when they were surrounded by Moslems demanding
their wounded be evacuated.
After spending the night in the village the five soldiers continued talks
with a group of villagers, most of them old people, women and children.
The British soldiers were joined by a third armoured car yesterday.
Artillery from surrounding mountains opened up and shells hit the crowd.
'The fire was very well-aimed, they obviously had an observation post in the
mountains,' Major Waters said.

Nervousness over political developments in Russia and Hong Kong caused the
already depressed London stock market to take a turn for the worse in
mid-afternoon when the FT-SE 100 index dipped to within five points of the

market staged a comfortable rally in late dealings. The final loss of 37.5

<TEXT>
UNITED Biscuits' full-year results on Thursday will be scarred heavily by
the profits collapse at Keebler, its US subsidiary, and a consequent
restructuring charge. With Keebler's margins still under pressure, analysts
forecast group pre-tax profits of about Pounds 160m, down from Pounds 211.3m
last time.
The McVitie's division is thought to have benefited from a stronger
year-end, as well as from contributions from European acquisitions. A small
improvement is forecast for the Ross Young's frozen foods business, though
KP Foods' results fell back slightly.
Annual profits from English China Clays, due on Monday, will reflect the
problems of the paper industry, its major customer. Paper-makers have been
trying to share their pain with suppliers, while ECC is also suffering
competition from the US. Analysts are looking for a fall in profits from
1991's Pounds 115.4m pre-tax to Pounds 85m-95m. However, under the new FRS 3
accounting standards, the numbers should look better, with a rise to around
Pounds 100m from Pounds 79.3m.
The end of the UK-quoted banks' reporting round comes on Monday with results
from HSBC Holdings. HSBC, which acquired Midland bank last summer, is
expected to announced pre-tax profits of between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds
1.8bn for 1992.
Guinness, on Thursday, is expected to report a 17 per cent decline in 1992
pre-tax profits to Pounds 795m. An exceptional charge of Pounds 125m for the
re-organisation of the group's whisky operations and Spanish brewing
business accounts for most of the shortfall on 1991's Pounds 956m.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the paper-maker, is likely to report on Thursday a
drop in pre-tax profits of around one-third to Pounds 160m. It is suffering
from the slowdown in the continental economies and excess capacity.
Laporte, the UK chemicals group, reports its full-year results on Monday.
During the takeover of Evode earlier this year, the company predicted that
its pre-tax profits would fall from Pounds 97.2m to Pounds 86m.
Analysts expect the full-year dividend to rise from 18.9p a share to between
19.3p and 19.7p. Analysts will be more interested in the group's forecasts
for the remainder of the year: more than a third of Laporte's sales are in
north America.
Rentokil, the pest control, plant hire and environmental services group, is
expected to report on Thursday another big jump in pre-tax profits for 1992.
Analysts are expecting about Pounds 115m-Pounds 122m (Pounds 94.6m) and a
full-year dividend of 2p-2.5p (1.7p) is forecast.
George Wimpey, the house-builder, is heading for a full-year loss om Tuesday
of around Pounds 70m before exceptional charges of Pounds 20m. Some recovery
is expected this year.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Budget squeeze on BES? - Speculation
centres on non-recourse and university schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMETH the Budget, cometh the BES speculation. Last year's announcement that
the business expansion scheme would be axed at the end of 1993 might have
put an end to the whispers which are always used to justify a rushed BES
investment on the eve of a Budget. But the whispers will continue, and
speculation centres on two areas: non-recourse loans and university schemes.
Non-recourse loans allow the investor to exit from the BES company after
only six months - not the five years intended originally. The Inland Revenue
could make them harder to operate by deeming a non-recourse loan to be an
effective disposal of the BES shares. This would sacrifice the tax relief.
Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, attacked non-recourse schemes this
week, pointing out the huge benefits they provide to top-rate taxpayers for
low risk. This intensified speculation that they will be axed, as even BES
advisers concede that the schemes are 'pure arbitrage.'
The Revenue itself is the source for the speculation surrounding university
schemes, having refused provisionally to allow tax relief for some companies
sponsored by Johnson Fry which bought accommodation for University College,
London. It has forced companies which have a contracted exit after five
years to spend the cash they raise as quickly as possible. Sub-letting to
foreign students or summer conferences will now be more difficult, as
universities must show that there is some financial benefit to the student.
Universities must also take care to show that the accommodation bought by
the BES company really is vacant.
What is likely to happen? The Revenue's dislike of university schemes -
particularly those where accommodation owned already by the university is
sold to the BES company, and no extra housing is built - is plain, but it
might already have been manifested in its clampdown.
Meanwhile, non-recourse loans were allowed only after careful consideration.
The schemes as they operate are almost offensively generous to top-rate
taxpayers while excluding basic rate-payers, and the subsidy for repossessed
housing is sent by an absurdly circuitous route.
But abolishing them now would - in the words of David Toplas, of Terrace
Hill Capital - 'deny the building societies a source of funding literally
weeks after it was first made available to them.'
A more cynical, but probably correct, view comes from Ian Pugh, of the
Allenbridge Group: 'Politically, it still looks dreadful, but it is a
discreet form of government subsidy to banks and building societies. That's
the effect of it.'
For all these reasons, a headlong dive to invest in the BES before the
Budget, if the scheme would not otherwise make sense to you, seems
ill-advised.
More schemes came on to the market this week and supply is now at an
unprecedented level. Competition has pushed up the rates on offer. According
to Pugh, Pounds 509m has been raised by non-recourse loan schemes to date,
with another Pounds 134m available for investment.
The following list, provided by Allenbridge, shows all the companies now on
offer which allow either non-recourse loans after six months, or a
contracted exit after five years, or both. Figures given are per Pounds 1
initially invested.
Accumulus III (76p after six months, Pounds 1.06 after five years).
A Priori (74p after six months, 78.31p after one year, 87.71p after two,

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Income shares: expect the unexpected
 -Philip Coggan on a complex, and sometimes risky, investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCOME SHARES appear to be all the rage at the moment. In the recent launch
of its Split fund, Schroder received so much demand for the shares that it
was forced to increase the size of the trust and buy large chunks of the
other classes of share itself.
The popularity of income shares is largely due to falling interest rates.
With returns from building societies more than halved over the last two and
a half years, investors are on the lookout for any product which can offer
an above-average rate.
Holding the shares tax-free within a personal equity plan (the Schroder
shares yield 8 per cent after charges) puts the icing on the cake. But
income shares can be complex instruments and investors need to consider the
risks carefully before buying.
Income shares receive all the dividend income of a particular investment
trust. Because they constitute only part of the capital of the trust, the
yield on each share can be much higher than on a conventional trust share.
There is a catch. In return for taking first claim on the trust's income,
holders allow other classes of share (usually zero dividend shares) to have
prior claim on a trust's capital.
Thus the danger for a private investor is to concentrate purely on the
current yield offered by an income share. Very often the shares will have a
set repayment value - which will often be less than the current price, and
in some cases, such as Contra-Cyclical, will be virtually zero.
What normally happens is that, in the early years of the trust, investors
are attracted by the running yield and push up the price; as the date
becomes due for the trust to be wound up, the share price falls rapidly
towards its repayment price. Those who buy such shares at the wrong time
will lock themselves into a capital loss.
This can also be true with the so-called 'hybrid' shares, which sometimes go
under the innocent-sounding name of 'ordinary income' shares. The repayment
value of such shares is not set, but dependent on what is left after
repaying the other classes of capital.
The value of hybrid shares can thus be highly volatile and dependent on the
manager's success in growing the assets of the trust.
There may well be investors who want securities which pay a high rate of
income but which run down capital - income shares could be an alternative to
an annuity, for example.
Such shares might also be useful for creating capital losses to offset
against gains elsewhere in the portfolio for CGT purposes. Remember,
however, that you cannot do this with income shares held in a Pep, which is
outside the CGT system.
But there may be many people who buy these shares without realising what
kind of investment they are getting. A reader wrote to the Weekend FT last
year, complaining that his income shares in Fleming Income &amp; Capital had
declined from Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 4,000 by the time he received his first
Pep statement. 'I may never see my Pounds 6,000 again,' he lamented.
In fact, by the time his letter arrived, his shares had rebounded so he was
back in profit. That is the kind of bumpy ride which hybrid income shares
can provide - and not all investors will enjoy it.
As we reported in January, Fleming and Kleinwort Benson wrote to investors
in their split capital trusts to warn them of the dangers involved in
reinvesting the income on high income shares.
Income shares were unpopular for a while in 1992 as investors worried that
UK companies were cutting dividends sharply as a result of the recession.
The fear was that many income shares would be unable to maintain their
dividends. But the period since Black Wednesday has seen a revival.
'As a sector, they have had a pretty good run as people have switched due to
falling interest rates elsewhere. It is becoming a fairly fully valued
sector. One has to search to find reasonable value,' says John
Korwin-Szymanowski, investment trust analyst at S G Warburg Securities
We asked Korwin-Szymanowski to recommend a few income shares that offered
the best returns. The table below shows four shares, with their current
price, the years before they will be wound up, the flat yield (the current
income divided by the share price) and the gross redemption yield, assuming
either no growth in the trust's income and assets or 5 per cent per annum
growth.
All this illustrates how complicated the calculations for the investor can
be. Take the M&amp;G Dual shares, which stand at 350p. The running income on the
shares is a whopping 26.3 per cent. But when the trust is wound up in under
four years time, the shares will be repaid at just 100p. So those who buy
Pounds 3,500 worth of shares now will get back Pounds 1,000.
If you allow for this, the gross redemption yield (assuming dividends stay
static) is 12.7 per cent. But because most of this return in the form of
income, the net redemption yield after basic rate tax is just 2.9 per cent
per annum. Even if one assumes dividend growth of 5 per cent per annum, the
net yield is just 6.6 per cent.
So this share, Korwin-Szymanowski points out, is only really suitable for
non-taxpayers. Other shares, which have lower flat yields, have more
attractive net redemption yields. One of his tips, General Consolidated, has
already cut its dividend but Szymanowski thinks the worst is over and the
shares are only marginally above the repayment value. So while the running
yield is lower than on M&amp;G Dual, the net redemption yield is higher.
Shares in Tor participate in some of the trust's capital growth, so the
redemption yield increases sharply on optimistic assumptions about the stock
market.
Because so much of the return is in the form of income, top rate taxpayers
should only consider income shares inside a Pep (and even then beware of the
capital losses). Once they have used up their Pep allowance, they will
normally be better off looking for capital gain than seeking extra income.
Few investors use up their annual CGT allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93).
Income shares can have their attractions. But it is not a good idea simply
to look in the papers for the stock with the highest yield. The expert
advice of a stockbroker is essential.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Few mourn the death of Taurus -
Richard Waters surveys the ruin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE MONSTER is dead. Private investors should just breathe a big sigh of
relief.' That was the reaction of David Jones, chief executive of discount
broker Sharelink, to this week's decision to pull the plug on the Taurus
computer. As the London Stock Exchange's plans for a paperless settlement
system were declared dead, it was a sentiment echoed in many quarters.
Taurus was never popular with the brokers who deal with individual investors
 -or with the investors themselves. The plan to do away with share
certificates and stock transfer forms, replacing them with a computerised
system for share ownership and transfer, aroused deep antipathy among many
investors. It was difficult to see what benefits the changes would bring,
and brokers hinted darkly that it would lead to higher costs.
The demise of the system (it proved too complex to build) does not mean that
nothing will change. The Bank of England has now picked up the baton and is
bent on forcing through quick changes to the settlement arrangements. In
fact, things could now move much faster than they would have if Taurus had
been kept alive. No decisions have yet been taken, but a number of things
are clear.
First, the interest of private investors will be given much higher priority
than they were last time around. Bank of England officials said this week
that some interest groups could suffer in the search for a swift solution to
London's settlement traumas - but it was a high priority to ensure that
private investors were not disadvantaged. That is an important political
priority after the Taurus fiasco.
Second, whatever developments replace Taurus, private investors are likely
to be treated differently from institutions, since their demands differ.
Institutions want to move quickly to a simplified version of Taurus,
involving a computerised system. Private investors are likely to be left
alone while this objective is pursued.
Third, most brokers have moved on since development of the Taurus system
began seriously in the mid-1980s. Most have given more management attention
to their back offices and automated more of their activities. Stephen Cooke,
of stockbroker Gerrard Vivian Gray, says: 'A firm like ours has halved its
settlement costs since 1987.' That has made settlement more efficient and
brought down the cost.
One aspect of this development has been the effort made by many brokers to
put private client's shares into their nominee companies. Some broking
services, such as Barclayshare and the Share Centre, operate exclusively on
a nominee basis. Also, most personal equity plans are managed through
nominees.
Nominee accounts are more efficient to manage than individual shareholdings:
brokers control the share certificates, and make transfers on behalf of
their clients. The arrangement effectively replicates many of the functions
of Taurus.
Of course, many investors do not want to use nominees. Most brokers charge a
fee for them. Also, being in a nominee account makes it impossible to claim
rights as a shareholder, for instance to receive a company's annual report
and attend its annual general meeting.
If nominees are the way of the future after Taurus, then the Bank of England
should give careful attention to how they can be made to operate more
effectively for private shareholders.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Markets: The components of recovery - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU go by headline figures alone, it was a good week for three UK makers
of motor components.
GKN, biggest of the three with annual sales of Pounds 2.53bn, increased
pre-tax profits by 77 per cent to Pounds 121.8m. T &amp; N gained 56 per cent to
Pounds 63m; BBA, 53 per cent to Pounds 47.4m.
They all had a familiar theme: stringent cost-cutting had enabled more
profit to be made out of sluggish sales. With the majority of their turnover
being overseas, they had some insulation against the prolonged UK recession.
It must be said that profits were recovering from a low base. With the new
FRS3 accounting rules bringing past rationalisation costs above the line,
GKN's 1991 pre-tax profit was reduced to a third of 1989's Pounds 206m peak.
More ominously, none of them bounced back far enough to cover their dividend
payments, which exceeded earnings per share for the second year running.
GKN's earnings were not far off its 20.5p pay-out, but T &amp; N managed to
cover only 55 per cent of its 10.85p dividend.
All three have made little change to the payments in three years, inspiring
relief among investors, who may have feared cuts, and consternation among
observers who believe too much has been distributed.
It would be wrong, however, to over-stress the comparability of the three
stocks and, as the chart shows, the market has treated them very differently
over the past six years.
GKN is the only one to have recovered the ground lost when cyclical stocks
were out of favour. Before the UK recession hit, its core businesses were
settled, particularly driveline components and pallet hire. 'It had stopped
mucking about,' said one analyst, whereas both T &amp; N and BBA had incomplete
hands and kept acquiring.
A related strength has been the much-admired GKN balance sheet. Net debt has
nearly halved since December 1989. Its latest figure for debt-equity gearing
was only 23 per cent, compared with 61 per cent for BBA and 45 per cent for
T &amp; N - rising to 60 later this year when a German acquisition is brought
in.
At the other end of the scale T &amp; N has effected the biggest transformation
from the least promising roots: in asbestos-ridden building materials. This
has, however, been funded by a string of rights issues. The sheer weight of
shares coupled with weak earnings has hit the price. Its 1987 issue - post
the AE acquisition - was priced at 205p; its 1991 issue - post JPI in the US
 -was only 140p.
BBA comes in between. It has settled down since its 1991 rights issue, which
eased the balance sheet after 14 deals in less than three years. Indeed it
has made a virtue of being more of an industrial holding company than an
auto engineer, playing down its dependence on any one market. With 35 per
cent of sales derived from north America, it is the best placed to benefit
from the recovery under way there.
Although only BBA's share price made progress this week, all three stocks
are trading near their 12-month highs. There is one big question that
affects their prospects: how far will the continental European car market
fall this year?
Forecasts from the car makers make sobering reading. Louis Hughes, president
of GM Europe, recently said new car sales in western Europe were expected to
fall from 13.4m to 12.3m this year, with Germany, Italy, France and Spain
all in retreat. GKN is thought to have the most exposure to the continent -
although T &amp; N is making a German acquisition just as that market dips.
Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman and chief executive, said this week that any
financial progress this year would again depend mainly on the group's
ability to cut costs and improve productivity. That means more job losses -
a pattern echoed elsewhere.
If doubts creep in about the prospects for earnings growth, worries will
also recur about dividends.
Those who have trusted the dogged determination to maintain, characterised
by Colin Hope at T &amp; N, have been rewarded in terms of yield. The companies,
however, have dipped into their reserves and been hit through the tax system
 -hence Sir David's call for ACT relief in the Budget.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Markets: Don't be rushed by the taxman - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS easy to get hurried into making investment mistakes at the end of the
tax year. The pressure of the April 5 deadline, the advertisements in the
papers and the brochures in the mail, the feeling of guilt at having
neglected their finances for the rest of the year: all conspire to persuade
investors to unleash their chequebooks.
Two products are receiving most of the attention; the business expansion
scheme and the personal equity plan. John Authers gives details of the
latest BES offers on page IV. Some are exploiting the quirks of the system
to offer high - and reasonably safe - returns over six months; such deals
often sell out within days.
But it is far from true to say that all BES offers are good deals. The
dangers of rushing into these investments are illustrated by Johnson Fry's
difficulties over its University College, London, scheme which was part of
two hastily-assembled offers at the end of the last tax year.
With personal equity plans, we cannot stress too often the danger that, in
some cases, the charges may outweigh the tax benefits.
The short-term tax gain is, in fact, fairly small; even if a Pep yields 5
per cent after charges, then a basic rate taxpayer who invests Pounds 6,000
is saving just Pounds 75 a year in tax. In some cases, it may be better to
buy the equities direct.
It is, of course, a good thing that investors are diversifying away from
their dependence on the building societies. Investors should have a balanced
portfolio of gilts, shares and cash. Furthermore, the evidence suggests
that, over the long term, equities are the best investment.
But the key words in that sentence are long term. If you take out a Pep now,
you are taking out a Pep with the UK stock market at an all-time high. You
must be prepared for the possibility that your investment might fall in
value in the short term.
Often, it is only when shares have been hitting new highs that investors
start to feel they might be missing out and pile into the market. Persuading
investors to buy at the bottom is far more difficult.
Back in November 1991, when the yield on the market was above 5 per cent, I
wrote a column urging investors to put money into the UK stock market.
Figures from M &amp; G then showed that there had been 30 years between 1919 and
1989 when the yield on the All-Share was more than 5 per cent at year end.
In every single case, investors in shares earned a positive real (after
inflation) return over the following five years; the average real return was
14 per cent per annum.
On the day the column appeared, the All-Share stood at 1182.51; it is now
1437.25, a rise of 21.5 per cent. And investors will have enjoyed income of
5 per cent or so on top.
Of course, for every journalist's prediction which is correct, there is
another that is wildly wrong. But the figures do show the benefits of buying
near the bottom of the market.
By contrast, the same M &amp; G analysis shows that there were 12 years when the
market ended the year yielding under 4 per cent. Following 10 of those 12
years, investors suffered a negative real return on equities over the
following five year period. The All-Share is yielding just over 4 per cent
at the moment.
This is not to say that investors should avoid equities, or Peps,
altogether. There is a good case for arguing that the budget deficit will
eventually force the government to raise taxes; and that will make the tax
concessions involved in a Pep more attractive. But it could mean that a
savings scheme approach, which smooths out the peaks and troughs of the
market, might be far more sensible.
The end of tax year rush tends to make investors forget about savings
schemes because they want to get the full Pounds 6,000 allowance into the
market. There is, however, a nice compromise: the phased approach (offered
by Fidelity, Henderson and Mercury, for example). This involves giving the
management group Pounds 6,000 up-front before April 5; it then drip-feeds
the sum into the market over the following year.
Alternatively, you could just wait for the stock market to retreat from its
euphoria. The old saying is 'Sell in May and go away'; shares often decline
in the summer months and you could well find the market looks more
attractive in, say, August. If you miss this year's Pep deadline, it is not
the end of the world.
Furthermore, those who are buying Peps for income should concentrate on
whether the dividend payments will be maintained or increased. Provided they
can be, and the present yield is better than building society interest, they
can try to ignore the capital element.
Of course, investors should be wary of plans which turn capital into income
(see the article on income shares on page III). But if investors are getting
a high income, they should be prepared for very little growth in their
capital.
Above all else, investors must be patient. Some of those who bought Peps
early in 1987 are breaking even only after 5 1/2 years. Others may already
have sold out in disgust. Come 1995, you might wonder why you bought that
Pep early in 1993; but by the year 2000, the reason should be crystal clear.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Markets: Down behind the U-bend, horror lurks - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THURSDAY, disaster befell the London Stock Exchange's plans to overhaul
its plumbing, and the plumber left abruptly, leaving a nasty-smelling mess
behind.
The hoped-for new plumbing was the exchange's Taurus scheme to abolish share
certificates and computerise the process of transferring them from seller to
buyer. The plumber was Peter Rawlins, the exchange's chief executive, who
resigned.
The dirty job of salvaging the situation will go to the Dyno-Rod team at the
Bank of England, by now well used to peering into the City's dark corners in
search of the unspeakable.
The City reacted to all this much as you might expect the tenants of a
ramshackle building to respond to distant rumblings in the pipes. They
complained that London was the laughing-stock of Europe, they blamed each
other, they said 'I told you so' - and they didn't let it make a blind bit
of difference to everyday life.
The market learnt the first tidings of Taurus's imminent demise on
Wednesday; that day the FT-SE 100 rose 6.8 points to 2,956.7, less than a
point away from the record close set on Monday. On Thursday, when the
cancellation became official, the index dropped only 3.3 points. Almost all
that loss was attributable to a further slide in the shares of Glaxo, until
recently the City's darling.
All glamour stocks get their come-uppance in time, and in principle there is
nothing remarkable in Glaxo's fall from favour. In practice, though, there
are two striking features. One is the sheer bulk that Glaxo has assumed in
the UK's financial landscape. Last autumn, it was the second most valuable
company in Europe, ranked by market capitalisation, and the most valuable
purely UK company. (The top-ranked group was Royal Dutch/Shell, which is
only 40 per cent British.)
Though Glaxo has now slipped back behind British Telecom in market
capitalisation terms, it is still worth around Pounds 20bn, making up 3.3
per cent of the FT-SE Actuaries 350, the stocks likely to be of interest to
the typical institutional fund manager. When Glaxo sneezes, the market
catches cold.
The second striking feature about Glaxo is that, for the bluest of blue
chips, it is a rather idiosyncratic company. For the last 13 years, it has
been dominated by Sir Paul Girolami, its chairman, who has dragged it from
obscurity to its present status as one of the two darlings of the world drug
industry. (Merck of the US is the other.) Sir Paul, now 67, has already
showed one chief executive the door, and this week he did it again, ushering
Ernest Mario firmly out.
Just as the management is dominated by one enormously powerful and talented
individual, so the profits are dominated by one enormously successful
product, the ulcer-drug Zantac. Both will soon be reaching the point at
which their contribution to the company starts to taper off; investors are
understandably nervous about the prospect.
Mario's departure pushed the shares down by 6 per cent in the immediate
aftermath of the announcement. They recovered much of that during that day,
and moved sideways on Friday, closing the week at 665, up 5p. Any
uncertainties about Glaxo's management were offset by the thought that the
company would now scarcely be likely to make a rights issue to finance a big
acquisition, one of the market's recent fears. Still, management succession
is an issue; the transition from a powerful chairman is never easy.
Look at BTR, another company associated in the public mind with a
strong-minded and creative chairman. That man, Sir Owen Green, stepped down
this week. The new chairman, Norman Ireland, is eminently qualified for the
post, having just ended a successful spell as chairman of Bowater.
So far, so smooth. Seen from another point of view, however, the transition
is an incomplete one. Ireland is 65 years old, and is best known for the
years he spent at Owen Green's side, as one of the triumvirate who ran BTR
in its years of fastest growth. His appointment raises the suspicion Sir
Owen was not yet ready to hand over full power to a younger generation.
The stock market paid less attention to such thoughts, however, than to
BTR's results, announced on the same day: an 18 per cent rise in profits to
Pounds 1.09bn, and evidence that the acquisition of Hawker Siddeley in late
1991 had not affected the group's traditionally healthy trading margin. The
shares ended the week at 610 1/2 p, up 26 1/2 p.
Other results were less reassuring. SG Warburg's running assessment of how
company results compare with its analysts' expectations shows a surprisingly
poor figure - a drop in pre-tax profits by 20 per cent compared with the
previous year, twice as bad as had been expected. For manufacturing
companies, where expectations had been rosier, the disparity was greater.
Investors appeared to be taking little notice of these figures, partly
because - Barclays apart - there have been no real individual horror
stories, and partly because much of the impact is ascribed to the switch to
the new FRS3 accounting principles.
Also at work was a traditional pre-Budget rally: BZW's Richard Kersley
calculates that over the past five years, the FT-SE 100 has risen some 3 per
cent in the month before the Budget, then dropped back exactly that amount
in the month that follows.
Still, on Friday the rumbling in the pipes grew louder: the drop in the Hong
Kong stock market dragged down the FT-SE 100 though its impact on HSBC
Holdings, the London holding company for Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corporation. HSBC shares fell 5.7 per cent, ending the week at 604p, down
12p. The index dropped 37.5 points, closing at 2915.9, a fall of 6.2 on the
week. Has anyone seen the plunger?

Britannia is offering first-time buyers an eye-catching 3.99 per cent
mortgage (8.1 APR). However the new rate, available from Monday, is fixed
for only six months before reverting to the standard variable rate,
currently 7.99 per cent.
Alternatively, potential buyers can opt for 5.99 per cent (8.3 APR) fixed
for the first year. To qualify for these rates potential buyers have to put
down a 10 per cent deposit. Higher rates are available for those who can
only put down 5 per cent. The rates apply to all types of mortgage but two
insurance related products must be taken out from the society.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Black Wednesday looks as though it should be re-christened White Wednesday
as far as the long-dated gilts market is concerned. Initial reaction to the
UK's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism stoked fears of
higher inflation in future, and long-dated gilt prices fell. But once base
interest rates began to fall, the market took off. As the graph shows,
anyone with the courage to buy gilts at their lowest point should be sitting
on a rise, once income is included, of 17 per cent in less than six months.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Markets: Inflation threat undermines the euphoria - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of inflation again alarmed Wall Street this week, sending stock
and bond investors scurrying for cover just two days after they had lifted
prices on both markets to record highs. The news that prompted yesterday's
heavy selling (in the first 30 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average tumbled more than 50 points and bond prices dropped sharply, sending
the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond back up past 6.8 per cent) was the
0.4 per cent increase in the February producer price index, a
closely-watched inflation indicator.
Although analysts were expecting a smaller increase in the PPI, the number
itself was not especially shocking, coming in no more than one-tenth of a
percentage point higher than the median of forecasts. So why was there such
a dramatic reaction from financial markets?
Essentially, the PPI number was, as they say on Wall Street, 'a wake-up
call.' Over the past year, both stock and bond investors, particularly the
latter, have grown complacent about the threat of inflation, which has been
running at an annual rate this past year of about 3.3 per cent.
More important to investors, the inflation outlook has consistently been
bright. Economic growth might have picked up in the past few quarters but it
has been remarkably uninflationary, and economists - who are forecasting
growth this year of between 3.0 and 3.5 per cent - expect it to remain that
way.
The reason is that they expect improvements in growth to remain primarily a
function of rising productivity which, over the past year, has helped to
keep unit labour cost inflation extremely low. If, in spite of accelerating
economic growth, the labour market remains depressed for the foreseeable
future, then the markets need not worry too much about wage inflation.
Yet, what about that extraordinary February employment report of just over a
week ago, when a wholly unexpected surge in non-farm payrolls spread
temporary panic in the bond markets? Was that not proof that the jobs market
was, finally, catching up with the recovery?
Not necessarily, if the most recent weekly jobs data are to be believed.
Thursday's report, showing a big rise in the number of people claiming state
unemployment insurance during the final week of last month, contradicted
directly the February employment figures.
However, not everyone was convinced by the news. There are those on Wall
Street who follow the weekly jobless claims numbers - which, they believe,
are both more accurate and more up-to-date - while others prefer to
concentrate on the monthly employment report, a supposedly less exact
measure but one that is less prone to volatility and a better measure of
longer-term trends.
Making sense of the conflicting economic evidence is not easy. The most
sensible response to the recent numbers would be to conclude that economic
growth will maintain a steady, if unspectacular, pace this year; that jobs
growth will remain sluggish; and that inflation, while still weak by
historical standards, will soon assume an upward trend.
Making sense of the stock and bond markets is another matter. Both look
distinctly overbought, which is probably why investors panicked slightly
yesterday when the inflation data proved worse than expected.
Equities still look expensive - the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 is trading at 23
times earnings - and bonds have been supported as much by short-term
technical factors (investors switching out of mortgage-backed securities
because of prepayment fears, and continued speculation that the Treasury
will slash the size of future long bond issues) as they have been by the
economic fundamentals. This means prices are vulnerable to sudden reverses.
On the positive side, money continues to flood in from investors seeking
better returns than from low-yielding certificates of deposit and money
market funds. This should provide a bedrock of support for share prices, and
please the mutual fund managers and stockbrokers.
Among the latter, Charles Schwab revealed this week that it executed a
record number of trades for customers during February, an illustration of
how much individual investors still like stocks.
This must have cheered Sanford Weill, who yesterday concluded a Dollars 1bn
deal that will merge the Smith Barney broking subsidiary of his Primerica
group with the Shearson brokerage unit of American Express.
The new creation will rival Merrill Lynch as a powerhouse in retail broking
 -an extremely profitable business to be in these days.

FT  13 MAR 93 / The Long View: Closing escape hatches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS a time for the vision thing. Alas, we are unlikely to get much of
this scarce commodity in Norman Lamont's Budget statement next Tuesday, but
it is important to turn aside from the narrow focus on occasional greenish
shoots of recovery and instead take, to coin a phrase, the long view.
Serious errors of domestic economic policy have plagued us but the most
important influence is exogenous. As the vast potential of China is being
unleashed upon the global traded goods market, with 1 bn people willing to
work for Dollars 1 an hour, several hundred million more are entering the
global economy in Eastern Europe.
It is not just a question of cheap Russian fish, which seems to be the
latest point of friction: the point is that the market value of low-skilled
labour in Britain is tumbling generally. There appears to be acceptance of
this, albeit reluctant; in my district this week, bus drivers confronted
with a pay cut of some 10 per cent did not even obey a one-day strike call.
For Lamont the serious budgetary consequences include a reducing tax take
and rising benefit costs. These structural problems cannot be cured in the
short term by any conceivable economic growth rate. So the government's
responsibility is not to engineer some kind of economic miracle, but rather
to establish a stable financial framework and to attempt to reconcile people
to the real world. And while the labour market crisis is painful it does
present important opportunities.
The immediate budgetary challenge is that the government will have to
finance large deficits for several years ahead. There is a feeling that they
might not be quite so large as pessimists have been fearing, and the public
sector borrowing requirement to be posted for 1993-94 may be nearer Pounds
40bn than Pounds 50bn. The chancellor may have a tactical opportunity to
please the markets. But in any event it will be a huge figure.
Luckily we are starting from the base of a relatively low debt burden of
about 40 per cent of GDP and, although massive deficits could raise that to
perhaps 60 per cent in about four years, the burden would be no more than in
the early 1980s. But the cost of borrowing will prove increasingly
important. Fortuitously, the global bull market in bonds has helped to drag
the cost of issuing long-dated British government securities down from over
9 per cent to about 8 1/4 per cent. But the official central expectation of
inflation, on the basis of the 1-to-4 per cent target range, is only 2 1/2
per cent.
Is the government seriously prepared to fund at a real rate of nearly 6 per
cent? The big deficits of the 1970s were financed at a zero real rate. There
is profound disbelief among professional investors: the inflation rate
implied by the real interest rate on index-linked gilts is still 4.8 per
cent. Norman Lamont cannot deliver an economic miracle next Tuesday, but he
could attempt the humbler task of undermining these inflation assumptions.
How? Well, the reason for the City's cynicism, besides bitter past
experience, is that the government is still clinging to inflationary escape
hatches: the modest debt-financed recovery in consumer spending in January
has been officially welcomed, and there are still dreams of a new wave of
mortgage lending at cheap rates that might raise house prices and bail out
busted borrowers and shaky lenders alike. The underlying reality, however,
is a collapse in earnings growth that is cutting real incomes and is making
a house price recovery impossible.
This should above all be a Budget for cutting interest rates, long as well
as short. The obvious comparison is with Geoffrey Howe's notorious
tax-raising 1981 Budget to which 365 Keynesian economists laid unavailing
siege (some are still camped outside the gates). But there are big
differences. Howe had to contend with a much higher inflation rate of 12 1/2
per cent, but at the same time there was a balance of payments surplus so
the country was able to borrow and consume its way out of recession. This
time around we must invest and produce towards recovery.
These are technicalities, but short-term rates must go down in order to
steepen the yield curve, especially between one and five years, and thus to
increase the relative appeal of longer-term government paper. This in any
case will need to happen if the so-called full funding rule is relaxed with
the objective of financing part of the Budget deficit through the banking
system. But sterling in these circumstances would be vulnerable, and in the
past, most recently in 1988, uncontrolled credit surges triggered by low
interest rates have proved highly inflationary.
This is the right moment, therefore, to tackle the short-termism of the
housing market. Tax relief on mortgage interest should be withdrawn except
in respect of loans on which the interest rate is fixed for at least five
years. Efforts should also be initiated to redirect small business finance
through new longer-term institutions rather than the banks, which no longer
want most of this business anyway.
Such measures would alleviate fears of inflation because they would tend to
reduce the growth of the broad money supply. Moreover the
politically-sensitive interest rate paid by home owners would become linked
to the long-term one rather than the short-term money market rate. Readers
would demand that the sterling long bond yield should be listed on the FT's
front page.
To keep mortgage rates low the government would need to follow prudent,
non-inflationary policies. Signs of irresponsibility would send up rates and
tend to produce weakness in the housing market, whereas at present
imprudence is often associated with lower short-term rates and therefore
with political popularity.
Just supposing you were a Downing Street visionary, even higher taxes could
have their good side.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Carnival: a dance to the music of crime - It's famous and
it's fun, as Christina Lamb discovers when she dances the samba through the
streets at dawn. But the reality is that Rio's showpiece festival hides a
dark underside, crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE illuminated clock tower of Rio Central railway station told me it was
4.15 am. I was balancing three plastic peacocks, each a metre high, on my
head and a pair of sequin-encrusted plasterboard wings on my shoulders. My
torso was contorted by a body stocking several sizes too small and my legs
tottered on silver boots. I reflected that I had never really wanted to
parade, clad like this, before 60,000 people. Especially at this hour.
With my centre of gravity somewhere behind my neck, an armpiece fell off if
I moved my legs. If I waggled my arms, the head-dress started to slide. As
if to accentuate my discomfort, a group of wayward birds started a jarring
rendition of the dawn chorus. The dull thud of a hangover was pounding my
temples and my smile was a grimace.
I was about to compete in Rio's yearly carnival parade as one of the 4,500
dancers defending the reputation of the Mangueira samba school - and still I
had not mastered the samba despite the valiant efforts of Carlinhos de
Jesus, my fleet-footed teacher.
The shout went up. It was our turn. Fireworks exploded and drums thundered
until the whole road shook and the air quivered with excitement and
anticipation. Our feet pawed the ground like racehorses. Pushing us into
lines, a man with a stick yelled 'Move it] Open your mouth] Sing]'. Then we
were off, running suddenly into the glare of a thousand lights. All around
in the stands, a blur of faces were waving pink and green flags - the
school's colours - and cheering 'Mangueira]'
The digital clock marking our progress moved slowly. We had 65 minutes to
pass along the 540m avenue. For the first 10, I thought I would never make
it. My throat rasped like sandpaper as, over and over, I croaked out the
words of our song: 'I'll devour this mango, even the core.' Sweat poured
down my face, glitter in my eyes. Suddenly, though, propelled by the energy
surging from the crowd, my feet began skipping in an extraordinary way. I
became part of an enormous magical opera, a wealth of feathers and glitter,
of floats bearing giant golden elephants, painted zebras and fearsome
warrior heads.
Carlinhos had said that samba moves people because its rhythm is like the
beat of the heart - and he was right. It was addictive, I never wanted to
stop.
The parade, which stretches from dusk to dawn on two nights, is the
glittering centrepiece of carnival, the biggest, most lavish party on earth.
A week-long jamboree, it involves hundreds of thousands of people and brings
the whole of Brazil to a stop. But, unknown to the mesmerised tourists, the
glamour and glitz hides the fact that it is funded largely by organised
crime.
The sponsors of the party are the bicheiros, the men who run the jogo do
bicho, or animals' game - an illegal gambling racket - and whose tentacles
spread through the underworld of Rio. Maria Laura Cavalcante, an expert on
carnival from Rio's Institute of Folklore, says: 'Beneath the parade's
beautiful face of light and art lurks a dark underside of crime, killing and
urban violence.'
It was not always so. Carnival has religious origins: the date marks the
start of Lent and the name derives from the Italian carne vale (goodbye to
meat). It began last century with European costume balls and parades for
royalty, based on the Italian Commedia dell'Arte. At the same time, the
African slaves on the sugar plantations in Brazil's north-east had their
own, far humbler carnival when one man would dress up as king for the day.
The two fused late in the 19th century after abolition of the trade and a
searing drought in the north-east sent many former slaves to Rio. The
pounding samba beat was the result of a suggestion by a Portuguese named Ze
Pereira that all the members of his carnival club should play their drums at
the same time.
Founded in the 1920s, the first samba schools were so-called because they
used school grounds for their rehearsals. Today, there are 60 schools in
Rio, mostly in the poorest areas after which they are named, and they have
become the heart of their local communities. The 14 top clubs, or Premier
League, compete annually in the main parade. This used to be in Avenida Rio
Branco, the city's main commercial thoroughfare, but in 1984 it was
transferred to the Sambadrome, a specially-constructed stadium designed by
Oscar Niemeyer and consisting of a long cement corridor lined with rows of
boxes and stands.
What really turned carnival from a somewhat ramshackle affair, with the poor
scraping together their own costumes and floats, into the grandiose
spectacle of today was the bicheiros. The jogo do bicho is as old as the
republic, having been launched by a certain Baron Joao Batista Drummond to
raise funds for his private zoo after the Portuguese empire ended in 1889.
The lottery - in which different animals represent different numbers - was
such a success that it was copied and multiplied, going underground when
gambling was declared illegal in 1946.
Despite being illegal, there are gambling points visible on almost every
street corner and around 300 bicheiros in Rio run a network of 1,200
lotteries employing some 40,000 people. It costs just Cr1,000 (3.5p) to bet
and the game is so popular, particularly among Rio's 3m favela (slum)
dwellers, that it moves millions of dollars each week. No one cracks down
because the police receive kickbacks, the politicians often have their
campaigns funded by the bicheiros, and the people can dream of winning
fortunes.
Bicheiros have long contributed to samba schools to gain support in the poor
communities where most of their clients (and much of the electorate) live,
but their patronage has become more explicit since the 1970s. The turning
point was 1975 when a bicheiro known as Anisio hired a top carnival
designer, Joazinho Trinta, to produce a spectacular parade with huge
papier-mache animals, spinning roulette wheels and fabulous costumes for his
school, Beija Flor. Since then, the bicheiros have thrown money at the
schools in attempts to outdo each other. In 1984, they created the Premier
League, in which only the Mangueira school is not run by them but by an
elected president.
Samba schools each spend an average of more than Dollars 1m on the parade
and some as much as Dollars 4m, up to 50 per cent of which is bicheiro
money. Such large sums mean that the parade has, increasingly, become
professionalised. Schools hire directors and keep dancers and singers on fat
retainers, swapping and selling them like football stars. Watched live on
television by 50m, the splendour of the costumes and floats has superseded
the importance of energy and dance skills in judging each parade.
My school, First Station of Mangueira, is one of the oldest. It was founded
in 1924 at Rio's first suburban railway station. In its fierce struggle to
retain some independence, it has obtained some sponsorship from companies
such as Shell. But the bicheiros are infiltrating; they have taken one
directorship already and the jaws of the big-timers who do not yet control a
school are snapping at the door. The last-but-one president was assassinated
and rumour has it that drug money is rife.
This year, a series of misfortunes suggested that Mangueira could keep out
the bicheiros no longer. Already-scarce funds were frozen last month when a
judge ruled in favour of a woman who claimed that Mangueira had stolen her
song. Rehearsals were cancelled and fierce squabbles broke out. Dona Neuma,
the school's 70-year-old First Lady and daughter of one of the founders,
attacked the 'new administration' and said she would not parade for the
first time in 64 years. Roberto Firminho, the president, retorted furiously
that 'the old lady should retire and stay at home with her mouth shut.' The
case was, however, resolved a week before carnival and Dona Neuma relented.
Four weeks before the big night I visited the barracao, the school's centre
of preparations in an enormous concrete hangar with a corrugated iron roof
and a pink gate, guarded to prevent rivals taking a sneak preview. Reeking
of carpenters' glue, hammers were banging and drills whirring everywhere.
Disembodied papier-mache figures and limbs lay discarded on the floor: here
a cow's head, there a count's leg. It seemed they could never be ready on
time and the work force was buzzing with talk about other schools' sumptuous
special effects. Firminho sauntered out to greet me. Rubbing his moustache,
he claimed not to be worried. 'It's always like this,' he smiled,
unconvincingly.
He was right, though. The week before carnival, the barracao had been
transformed into a magical kingdom of medieval castles, French drawing rooms
complete with marble columns, green brocade, gilded mirrors and chandeliers,
Portuguese galleons on a silver sea, 10 ft-high elephants, and zebras
dancing around an enormous African warrior head.
A man with a clipboard of pencil sketches was barking orders at 100 people
working round the clock on 10 floats, scurrying up and down ladders with
hammers and paint brushes, creating marvels from foam, fibreglass, wire and
paints of myriad colours. Ilvamar Magalhaes is the carnavalesco, the man who
creates the Mangueira 'look.' Having chosen this year's mango theme almost a
year ago, he buried himself in libraries to discover how the fruit came to
Brazil and to design the floats and costumes (known as fantasias) to tell
the story.
Carnival is an enormous industry, bigger even than shipbuilding.
Preparations for the big week provide permanent employment for 80,000 people
including musicians, architects, carpenters, electricians and sculptors.
Samba schools are the main breeding ground for musicians and dancers, who
spend the rest of the year giving demonstrations. Some of the painters in
the barracao are well-known artists.
Parade day dawned cloudy and rain-laden but could not dampen the general
glee. Inflation of 30 per cent a month and searing recession were forgotten
as society people and slum-dwellers mingled, worry lines falling from faces
before my eyes. Walking towards the lights of the Sambadrome through a
warren of tiny streets littered with beer cans and bits of fantasias, Cosmi
Tudo, a drummer from Mangueira - resplendent in white silk tunic and gold
turban and unrecognisable as a construction worker - said: 'We're poor and
no one notices us but, for one day of the year, we're kings.'
As we watched the other schools parade, our spirits soared. Surely, we said,
the Mangueira song is catchier, its floats prettier. We laughed cattily as
the Salgueira school's flag-bearer slipped, someone lost a hat, and a dancer
from Estacio fainted. On and on went the processions of warriors, Indians,
voluptuous women in rhinestoned bikini bottoms (their breasts splendidly
naked and surely silicone-enhanced), cavemen under showers, giant insects,
mermaids, and older women whirling in wide, hooped skirts held up with
hosepipes.
We marvelled at the giant steamships of Salgueira and the gadgetry of
Mocidade with its flying model helicopter, lasers and video screens. It
seemed an incredible waste in such a poor country for so much luxury to be
created for just one night and then thrown away, but Trinta explained:
'Intellectuals want poverty but the masses don't. They want luxury.'
Finally, it was our turn as the last school of the second night, the pink
glow of dawn visible already over the lights of the favelas. The roar of the
audience sent us into ecstasy - except for five breath-stopping minutes when
the mast of our Portuguese caravela got stuck under the television tower.
Afterwards, Magalhaes was jubilant: 'It's definitely our best since 1987
(the last time the school won).'
Convinced we had come second, the results announced the following afternoon
were a huge disappointment: Mangueira was placed a poor fifth and Salgueira
had clinched its first victory in 17 years, scoring top marks in all
categories from choreography to floats, story, costumes and music. A
devastated Firminho said the school would appear at the champions' parade
for the top five schools wearing black headbands. He complained: 'Some
judges always try to appease the most powerful.' Dona Neuma was more
philosophical: 'Mangueira has been parading 68 years. We're used to such
results. I cry.'
Over at Salgueira, it seemed the celebrations would never stop. King of it
all, in a white suit and banana grin, was Waldemir Garcia, known as Miro - a
bicheiro who describes himself as a farmer. Only a week earlier, he had been
in court - bracketed by heavily-armed security guards in dark glasses -
facing charges for drug trafficking and running gangs.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Search starts for Taurus successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England task force considering a new stock market settlement
system for London yesterday focused on a two-tier system which would treat
individual investors and big institutions differently.
At a two-hour meeting, the 10-member task force agreed to look urgently at
using an existing stock exchange system, Talisman, as the basis for a new
institutional settlement system. Whatever the outcome there will be
wide-ranging consultation before any decision is taken.
The task force, drawn together hastily this week, was meeting the morning
after the stock exchange scrapped its ill-fated Taurus project and accepted
the resignation of Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive.
Talisman was introduced in 1979 as an automated settlement system for
marketmakers, who hold shares in what are known as 'Sepon' nominee accounts.
One person present at the task force meeting said afterwards: 'The Sepon
system is perfectly capable of doing the job. There's no reason why it
shouldn't be used for institutional investors.'
Similar ideas were expressed widely in the City yesterday by brokers and
custodians. However, there were some doubts whether Talisman could be
adapted to handle the extra volume of trades.
A quick move to Talisman - regarded as possible before the end of this year
 -would enable institutional investors to settle transactions soon after
they have been carried out, perhaps after only three days. For private
investors, the time taken to settle their trades would be longer.
Talisman could also be made available to nominee companies which pool the
shareholdings of individual investors, the task force member said.
This would effectively allow some individuals to settle trades in the same
way as institut-ions.
Mr David Jones, chief executive of Sharelink, the stockbroking firm which
regularly handles up to 10 per cent of the bargains on the stock market,
said: 'The banks and the registrars have got to be told that they cannot run
this industry for their own interests.'

FT  13 MAR 93 / Bombay blasts leave 200 dead: Federal troops flown in after
wave of bombings on commercial targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last
night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200
people and injuring more than a thousand.
The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a systematic attack on India's
commercial heart. All exploded within 90 minutes in the afternoon. Among the
targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a
shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
The identity of the bombers was unknown, but the attacks were a severe
setback to India's attempts to heal the wounds created by recent
intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India.
More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after
the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on
December 6.
The bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to
undermine efforts by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the
economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.
One of the targets was close to the headquarters of Shiv Sena, a Hindu
nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riots, in which
most victims were Moslems.
National and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent
a renewed outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumours
after the 'inhuman and criminal bomb blasts'.
Mr Sharad Pawar, the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief
minister of Maharashtra state, said all roads into Bombay had been blocked
and the army put on alert. He said: 'It is aimed at disrupting the economy
and it appears a conscious effort because only Bombay seems to be the
target.'
Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament
in New Delhi: 'We suspect an international conspiracy.'
The Indian High Commission in London said the attacks were 'part of the
externally supported terrorism which has targeted India for some time'.
However, Indian officials stopped short of directly accusing Pakistan, the
country's arch-enemy.
The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at
the city's better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which
victims were mainly poor.
At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people were on the
second-storey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car
park, hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street. Some
victims were crushed in the stampede to escape. Outside, burned bodies lay
among litter from shattered buildings.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Birt pay scheme row revives as BBC governors voice concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK, DAVID OWEN and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE increased yesterday on Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, and Mr
Marmaduke Hussey, his chairman, over Mr Birt's tax affairs and his years as
a freelance consultant at the corporation.
As more BBC governors broke with tradition and spoke anonymously of their
concerns about damage to the BBC's reputation, it emerged that the
Department of Trade and Industry is investigating other company accounts
prepared by Mr Michael Henshaw, the accountant employed by Mr Birt.
Nearly two weeks after the revelation that Mr Birt as deputy
director-general had been hiring himself to the BBC through his private
company, John Birt Productions, and thereby saving tax, with the agreement
of Mr Hussey and vice-chairman Lord Barnett, the row shows no sign of
fading.
On Monday Mr Birt expressed regret and applied to join the staff. The row
was revived the next day by his refusal to name the secretarial assistant
paid Pounds 15,000 by his company and the subsequent revelation that she was
his wife Jane, who also received a Pounds 14,000 fee as a director.
Lord Bonham-Carter, a former vice-chairman of the BBC governors, said last
night: 'I think John Birt's position is becoming increasingly difficult as
one revelation follows another.' He said the governors had 'every reason to
be extremely angry if they were not informed about the nature of this
arrangement'.
One senior governor said he was 'concerned very deeply' that he had not been
told about a 'non-standard arrangement' such as Mr Birt's contract.
The governors meet on Wednesday at a dinner in honour of Sir Michael
Checkland, the retiring director-general. Mr Birt will attend the dinner.
His future and that of Mr Hussey could be decided at Thursday's formal
meeting of the governors.
Yesterday the Labour MP Mr David Winnick called on Mr Birt to resign. 'There
is a growing feeling in political circles and I am sure within the BBC that
the best course of action would be resignation,' he said.
Some 64 MPs, including several members of the Labour front bench, this week
signed a parliamentary early day motion criticising BBC management.
The DTI probe will cover a number of companies created by well-known
individuals from the media who have been advised by Mr Henshaw.
It follows revelations that the 1991 accounts of John Birt Productions
failed to comply with a range of auditing and accounting requirements, such
as not signing the auditor's report. This will embarrass Companies House,
the official depository of corporate information, which should reject
accounts which do not have a signed audit statement.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Patten presses on without China deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China have failed to agree a basis for talks about Hong Kong's
political future, Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, told the local
legislature yesterday.
He ordered immediate publication of his democracy legislation.
Mr Patten told a packed Legislative Council (LegCo) that the UK and Hong
Kong governments had done all they reasonably could to achieve agreement
with China. But Beijing had refused to accept Hong Kong government officials
as part of the British team and would not commit itself to a date for the
start of talks.
China's reaction was swift. A senior Chinese government official said the
governor's action meant Sino-British talks could not proceed. Mr Zheng
Guoxiong, vice-director of Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, said Mr Patten
had 'deliberately ruined the foundation of talks'.
The Hong Kong stock market reacted badly. The Hang Seng Index, which only
earlier this week had risen to record levels, fell sharply in the last hour
of trading. The index ended 201.44, or 3.16 per cent, lower at 6,170,40.
Mr Patten said he remained prepared ready to talk to China about
arrangements for the colony's 1994-95 elections. He would not present the
bill to LegCo on Wednesday, as would be normal, but would judge 'in the
light of subsequent developments' when best to do so.
The governor made it clear that China's conditions for talks were totally
unacceptable. 'I cannot myself see how (diminishing the standing of Hong
Kong government officials) demonstrates sincerity or how it demonstrates a
commitment to make a success of talks, a success that I would like to see.'
He told BBC radio he was not prepared to 'humiliate' Hong Kong by agreeing
to China's demand that talks should be between Beijing and London without
Hong Kong representatives. 'What I'm not prepared to do is to confuse being
accommodating and conciliatory on the one hand with having absolutely no
principles on the other.'
A British Foreign Office official said last night it was hard to escape the
conclusion that China had engaged in an elaborate exercise of deception.
From virtual agreement to talks on Thursday morning it tried to change the
basis for talks on Thursday afternoon and yesterday morning.
Reaction within LegCo to Mr Patten's decision divided largely along party
lines. Liberal politicians supported his stand while conservative
legislators reacted with disappointment.
Mr Allen Lee, leader of the main conservative bloc in LegCo, said he could
not envisage a situation where Britain and China confronted each other for
the next four years.

FT  13 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Drinks sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The near 10 per cent relative decline of the UK drinks sector this year
reflects not only its fading defensive attraction. Alcohol is an obvious
target for a chancellor wrestling with a PSBR of more than Pounds 40bn. Not
surprisingly, the industry is busy inventing reasons why increased duties
could be counter-productive. The tax take might suffer when domestic
consumption of beer and spirits is dropping and personal imports from the
continent are growing.
Where beer is concerned, these arguments look self-serving. Duty indexation
would add less than 1p to the price of a pint. That is much less than the
large price increases imposed a couple of years ago by brewers and which
contributed heavily to the fall in demand. Slight over-indexation of duty
would not now make matters significantly worse. Though personal imports
account for nearly 10 per cent of the take-home trade, the share was 6 per
cent before allowances were increased in January. The trend will be clearer
by the November Budget.
The spirits case is stronger. The alcohol in spirits is taxed more heavily
than in beer and wine, and markedly more than in cider. High UK duty
undermines producers' ability to argue against duty increases in European
export markets. But EC harmonisation is a long-term issue. There have been
some sharp wholesale price increases in spirits this year. The stock market
is probably right to assume that the chancellor will be letting those
responsible off lightly if he opts for mere indexation.

FT  13 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK engineering
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's clutch of engineering company results once more showed the
corrosive effect of advance corporation tax on foolhardy companies which
earn profits overseas. Given that the chancellor is strapped for cash, there
is unlikely to be much help on Tuesday, despite the government's hollow
rhetoric about overseas trade. Still, at least most of the companies seem to
have learned one lesson from the last recession. They cut costs early and
used real business levels, rather than Mr Lamont's claims on the economy, as
a strategic guide.
Other defensive measures have been less well rewarded. International
diversification has meant that companies which had to endure the long
Anglo-Saxon recession will now have to follow on with a long continental
European decline. While distorted, January and February's 23 per cent fall
in continental car sales is a chilling indication of how bad things might
get. And despite the strengthening US recovery, the UK car component
manufacturers' greater exposure to Europe will mean another very tough year
ahead. The flawed logic of balancing aerospace interests with motoring
business has been exposed by the severe downturn in both areas. Rumblings
from Boeing suggest that it will have to cut production once more.
The clearest victim of these problems is Lucas, which has yet to report. It
is slap-bang in the target zone, has been persistently over-optimistic about
trading and held back from cutting costs. Small wonder that it is proving
tough to find a new chief executive.

FT  13 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington looked rather silly three years ago when rival Saint Gobain swept
up the Solaglass distribution business and strengthened its grip on the UK
market. The acquisition of Heywood Williams' glass merchanting arm helps
spare its blushes.
The deal gives Pilkington 24 per cent of the distribution market, delivering
a firm customer base and the critical ability to increase the utilisation
rates of its float lines. The move makes so much strategic sense that one
wonders why Pilkington did not act before. After all, such vertical
integration is common in most other European markets.
The main worry is the cost. Pilkington is doubtless right that it could not
afford to pass up the opportunity. Nevertheless, Pounds 95m looks a lot for
a business that made profits of just Pounds 2.7m last year. Although the
purchase will enhance earnings and will ease Pilkington's ACT burden, it
will also nudge year-end borrowings close to Pounds 1bn.
Yet events are beginning to swing Pilkington's way. The pound's devaluation
has enabled it to recapture market share. Its 8 per cent price rise in the
UK has a reasonable chance of sticking. The likely sale of its US Sola
business in the early summer seems set to realise more than Pounds 200m.
Even so, Pilkington will face a dilemma whether to maintain another
uncovered dividend. The company must hope that its recovery prospects by
then will be strong enough to render such worries obsolete. It is a tight
call.

FT  13 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Red noses, red screens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 37-point fall in the FT-SE 100 index injects a note of realism
into UK equities. Unfolding events in Russia and Hong Kong, combined with a
tumbling US equity market, provided the excuse. But the results season so
far has been something of a mixed bag. Given the potential for upset in next
week's Budget, and the continued flow of rights issues, good reasons for
caution can be found closer to home.
There are some striking contrasts in the latest crop of company results.
Figures from companies as diverse as BAT Industries, BTR, and GKN proved
well up with the market's best expectations. Companies which cut costs and
maintained investment through recession now have the operational gearing to
deliver earnings growth.
There are notable exceptions. The Pounds 184m pre-tax loss and dividend cut
announced by Rolls-Royce on Thursday was a reminder that sections of UK
manufacturing are still fragile. Equally, Vickers and WPP are not last in
the queue of companies hoping to repair damaged balance sheets with a rights
issue.
Selective buying, then, may be the best strategy. The strength of the FT-SE
100 index relative to small and medium-sized companies suggests that the
blanket buying of cyclical stocks seen this winter has come to an end. That
is not before time. There is still an outside chance the chancellor will be
tempted into an early tightening of fiscal policy on Tuesday. If that was
seen to prejudice the chances of recovery, companies travelling hopefully
for the last six months will look vulnerable indeed.

FT  13 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drops after heavy selling
in bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices fell sharply yesterday after an unexpectedly strong February
producer prices index sparked heavy selling in the bond market amid fears of
a revival in inflation, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.18 at 3,427.82,
above its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
finished 3.92 lower at 449.80, while the Amex composite ended down 1.22 at
421.09, and the Nasdaq composite 1.50 lower at 692.78. Volume on the NYSE
was 247m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 1,376 to 545.
The news that prompted the selling yesterday was the 0.4 per cent rise in
the February PPI and although the increase was only slightly higher than
forecast, equity investors reacted badly to the figures - partly because of
the sell-off in the bond market that they triggered. In late trading the
benchmark 30-year bond was down almost 1 1/2 points at 103 7/32 , pushing
the yield up to 6.867 per cent.
Investors were also selling because of a lack of confidence in the market's
recent rally, which only on Wednesday lifted the Dow to a record high.
Stocks look expensive in relation to corporate earnings, and recent
statistics have cast some doubt on the outlook for the economy.
Analysts also said that concern about the political situation in Russia may
have contributed to declines.
Primerica rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 49 1/2 and American Express added
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 28 after the two groups concluded a Dollars 1bn deal
in which the latter's Shearson broking subsidiary will be merged into
Primerica's Smith Barney brokerage unit.
Under the terms of the deal, American Express will get Dollars 850m in cash,
Dollars 125m in convertible preferred stock and Dollars 25m in warrants from
Primerica. American Express said it would take a first quarter charge of
about Dollars 630m, which would include taxes, transaction-related costs and
a reduction in goodwill of Dollars 750m.
General Motors eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 3/8 in volume of 2m shares
as investors shrugged off the unexpected departure of Mr J Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortura, the head of worldwide purchasing at the carmaker and a key
figure in the company's cost-cutting campaign.
Cyclical stocks were hit by selling, primarily because they had enjoyed big
gains earlier in the week when optimism about the economy was sweeping
stocks to new highs. Caterpillar lost Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 57 3/4 ,
International Paper slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 64, General Electric
tumbled Dollars 1 to Dollars 86 1/2 , Goodyear dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 74 1/2 , and Alcoa fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 1/2 .
Canada
IN TORONTO a late rally brought stock prices back from their lowest levels
of the day to close with only a small loss. According to early figures, the
TSE-300 index fell 4.36, or 0.12 per cent, to 3,548.06, for a gain on the
week of about 24 points. Declines led advances 358 to 272, and the volume of
48.594m shares was well below yesterday's 65.787m shares, and trading value
fell to CDollars 468.1m from CDollars 573m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAST minute buying by foreign investors and arbitrageurs boosted the Nikkei
index above the 18,000 level for the first time since September 25.
The Nikkei closed up 132.73 at 18,037.52, its sixth consecutive rise and 7.3
per cent higher on the week; it moved between 17,823.52 and 18,043.95,
fluctuating in the morning session on price fixing for March contracts of
stock index futures and options.
Volume rose to 800m shares against 444m. Some 500m shares changed hands
during the first hour on futures and options-related trading. Domestic
institutions, which close their books for the March year-end, liquidated
arbitrage positions, while foreign investors and public funds were the big
buyers.
Gains led losses by 695 to 316, with 153 unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks rose 6.60 to 1,350.94 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index edged up 0.44 to 1,085.40.
Traders said that continued selling by investment trusts and corporate
investors was countered by foreign buying. The Tokyo stock exchange
announced that foreigners were net buyers of Y10.3bn worth of stocks during
the first week of March, turning buyers for the first time in four weeks.
Investment trusts sold a net Y32.1bn worth of shares, while individual
investors sold Y32.8bn. Banks became net sellers for the first time in 26
weeks, selling Y2.9bn.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone continued to lead the rise, advancing Y15,000
to Y810,000. Corporate holders of NTT shares were also strong, with NEC,
which holds 8,000 shares and was the most active issue of the day, rising
Y18 to Y779. Hitachi, which owns 6,000 shares, rose Y12 to Y757.
On the other hand, air transport was the worst performing sector of the day,
falling 2.94 per cent. A sharp fall in Japan Airlines, which closed down Y28
to Y563 on rumours of heavy foreign exchange losses, weighed on the sector.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 85.58 to 18,919.80 in volume of 31.5m shares.
Roundup
BOMBAY's stock market was badly damaged after a bomb exploded near the
trading floor, one of more than a dozen that were detonated in the city
yesterday. Hong Kong lost more than 3 per cent after Mr Chris Patten, the
governor, said that he was to press ahead with democratic reform proposals.
HONG KONG fell sharply after Mr Patten's announcement, which came just
before the close of trading. The decision surprised investors, many of whom
had been expecting a resumption in Sino-British talks. The Hang Seng index,
which had earlier seen a high of 6,447, closed 201.44 lower at 6,170.40, a
fall of 5.1 per cent on the week. Turnover fell slightly to HKDollars 5.04bn
from HKDollars 5.10bn.
The selling continued in London as over-the-counter share prices declined
strongly, indicating a further fall in the Hang Seng of some 200 points.
Analysts forecast that the Hang Seng could fall to 5,850 before the low
prices begin to attract foreign investors.
Declines were widespread with HSBC Holdings down HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars
66 and Hang Seng Bank, which reports 1992 earnings on Monday, HKDollars 2
lower at HKDollars 66. Jardine Matheson fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 50.
AUSTRALIA tried to extend its gains but a bout of pre-election nerves left
the All Ordinaries index up just 0.4 at 1,661.5, off its morning high of
1670.9 but 3 per cent better on the week.
Coal &amp; Allied rose ADollars 2.05 to ADollars 11.10 on news of CRA's ADollars
11.50 a share takeover offer. Analysts said that CRA should win control.
BANGKOK's SET index rose 19.50, or 2.2 per cent to 916.26, up 1.9 per cent
on the week, in turnover of Bt6.85bn. There were rumours that Thailand's SEC
could be considering reducing the level of punishment for those involved in
share manipulation.

Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES subsided yesterday afternoon, following an unfounded claim in Moscow
that armed troops had entered the Kremlin, and a distinct lack of enthusiasm
for equities on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT shelved interest rate prospects for worries about Russia, and
uncertainty about the outcome of talks between Bonn and the regional German
states on the financial aspects of a solidarity pact. The DAX index ended
10.26 lower at 1,707.14, still 1.4 per cent higher on the week.
Turnover fell from DM7.6bn to DM6.8bn. Among blue chips, VW rose DM3.60 to
an official DM292.80 close on news that GM's purchasing chief, Mr J. Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortura, is joining VW. Mr Lopez, a tough cost-cutter, would
likely to help VW improve profit margins, dealers said. VW lost DM5.70 after
hours.
Daimler dipped on the news of lower 1992 profits, closing at DM623 and
ending the afternoon a net DM10.70 down on the day at DM66.50.
PARIS struggled throughout the day, the decline accelerating as Wall Street
opened. The CAC-40 index closed 23.70 down at 1,965.18 after a high of 1,980
and a low of 1,957, as turnover remained static at FFr2.6bn.
In the absence of fresh corporate news, activity was concentrated on the big
blue-chip stocks: among financials Suez, leading the actives, dipped FFr5.20
to FFr314.70, Societe Generale FFr6 to FFr638 and Paribas FFr11.10 to
FFr416.
Credit Lyonnais CI's slipped FFr15 to FFr520 after the chairman estimated
that the bank's 1992 results were the worst for 20 years.
In the car sector Peugeot lost FFr2 to FFr567, having been a little stronger
on Thursday following Renault's better than expected results. Valeo eased
FFr10 to FFr785.
AMSTERDAM retreated with a fall in the CBS Tendency index of 1.6 to 104.2,
down 2.3 per cent on the week. Prices were generally depressed with even ABN
Amro losing Fl 1.20 to Fl 53.80 after reporting a satisfactory 9.6 per cent
rise in net profit.
VNU declined Fl 3.20 to Fl 104.20 after confirming that it was holding talks
with another Dutch company over a possible partnership in its printing
operations.
Commenting on this move, NatWest Securities in London said that while some
investors may have been disappointed that VNU had not found an outright
buyer for the division, long-term prospects remained positive.
MILAN remained weak ahead of Monday's end of the March account with a 6.46
fall in the Comit index to 514.24, down nearly 4 per cent on the week.
The construction sector built on Thursday's losses after a parliamentary
committee blocked a government decree which would have allowed public works
projects, halted because of the current political corruption scandals, to
have proceeded. Cogefar Impresit fell L40 to L2,690 and Grasseto lost L550
to L6,400.
Sip, the telecommunications group, eased just L2 to L1,654 as investors
showed little reaction to its L850bn rights issue.
BRUSSELS engaged in profit-taking after a moderately active session with the
steel stocks, Arbed and Clabecq, the main centre of attention. The Bel-20
index closed 7.23 lower at 1,238.75, up 1.5 per cent on the week.
The Luxembourg-based Arbed closed BFr250, or 8.3 per cent lower at BFr2,750
and Clabecq dropped BFr48, or 12.6 per cent to BFr332.
STOCKHOLM was weaker as the country's own political crisis remained
unresolved. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 13.5 to 1,012.5, a fall of
1.8 per cent on the week as turnover fell to SKr635m from SKr845m.
Volvo lost SKr14 in the B shares to SKr380 after its disappointing results
on Thursday.
ZURICH tumbled on the Russian news, the SMI index closing 37.2, or 1.7 per
cent lower on the day at 2,164.4, a fraction lower on the week. After gains
in cyclicals earlier in the week, Brown Boveri was the most active stock of
the day, the bearers falling SFr50 to SFr4,020, but Nestle bearers fared
worse with a decline of SFr40 to SFr1,130.
HELSINKI reacted to Thursday's downgrading of its foreign currency debt

FT  13 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Madrid awaits a key interest rate
decision - But the authorities are cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week could be the one that the Spanish bolsa has been waiting for. Not
for a long time has there been such a strong feeling that domestic interest
rates will come down.
Hopes went on hold this week, especially yesterday when the general index
fell 3.04 to 237.41 on profit-taking, declines in other bourses and after
0.2 per cent negative GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1992.
However, underlying sentiment has been lifted by the prospect of lower
domestic inflation figures, due at the beginning of next week, and by the
expected easing of key rates in Germany.
What the market is looking for is a cut of perhaps a half-point in the
current 13 per cent benchmark intervention rate when the Bank of Spain holds
the repurchase tender of its certificates on March 22.
The forecasts of a rally coincide with what appears to be a key change in
foreign perceptions about the domestic market. Foreign institutions which,
demonstrably, had underweighted Spain last year, seem to have cottoned on to
the fact that the bolsa is relatively inexpensive.
With the general index hovering at around 240, the bolsa has put on just
over 12 per cent in value since its nadir at the beginning of this year.
By the end of 1992 the Madrid market was undervalued by perhaps as much as
40 per cent and by the end of this year, in the present bullish mood,
professionals have estimated that the bolsa could climb to 280.
'People are not selling Spain now,' says Mr Juan Bastos of the Madrid
brokers Ibersecurities. 'Investors are not asking whether they should come
into but when they should come in. That's a very important switch in
perception.'
What seems to have occured is a general decision that the bolsa has hit rock
bottom, and that it is time to change positions. If the sentiment in 1992
was to sell in order to come back in at a later date, the mood now is that
the later date has more or less arrived; any delays could make the return
more expensive.
The upcoming partial privatisations of Repsol, the state-controlled energy
group, and of Argentaria, the state-controlled banking corporation, have
created an opportunity for investors to correct the underweighting that
marked the past months. Both placings are very likely to have a knock-on
effect on the rest of the bolsa, simply in the enthusiasm that they
generate.
Ahead of either flotation, however, all eyes are expected to focus on how
the financial authorities will move. The Bank of Spain is extremely cautious
and conservative about easing the interest rates, but, observers ask, can it
resist for much longer the growing clamour to ease?
The inflation figures are more important than usual, in part exceptionally
so because they will cover two months, January and February - the January
figures were not released last month because the statistics office was
overhauling the CPI price base - and in part because they are expected to
show a strong improvement in the inflationary trend.
The expectation is that year-on-year inflation will be shown to have eased
to around 5.0 per cent or 5.1 per cent in January from the 5.4 per cent rate
in December, and that the National Statistics Institute will show a further
drop to as low as 4.7 per cent in year-on-year headline inflation in
February.
Figures like that should be good for the bolsa. A subsequent cut in German
rates would give the Bank of Spain considerable room to manoeuvre. 'Money in
Spain is far too tight, the rates have to come down but Germany has the last
word,' says Mr Alvaro Villacieros of the Madrid office of James Capel.
The Bank of Spain, of course, has a last word, too. It will have until the
week after next, and its repo auction, to gauge exactly what signal the
Bundesbank is giving and what the best response might be. It will certainly
be looking for a differential of at least 400 basis points against the
German rates.
For all the bullishness in the air, wise market analysts are extremely wary
of overplaying it. The Bank of Spain has every reason to be as tight as it
possibly can: wage settlements, which are coming in at between 6.5 per cent
and 8.5 per cent, are not showing the desired restraint and the government
deficit in 1992, according to the latest figures filtering through, could be
closer to 5.4 per cent of GDP instead of the 4.4 per cent claimed by the
economy ministry.
The Bank, moreover, is fully aware that fresh assaults on the peseta within
the ERM are all too likely. There is a 'risk assumption' among foreign
investors that the ERM could fall apart or, more exactly, that the peseta
will abandon its battle to remain at the heart of the hard core of the
monetary system.
Everything that the government and the Bank of Spain has said to date,
however, emphasises that the British option, with its plunging currency and
interest rates, is not an option for Spain. The Spanish bulls will be at
best cantering, never galloping.

the market lower, the ordinaries easing a penny to 78 1/2 p, and the 'A'
shares also down a penny at 75p. Swiss Bank Corporation was said to have
been a heavy buyer of both classes of Trafalgar stock late in the session.
The Seaq delayed ticker revealed a block of 4.4m ordinaries had changed
hands at 76p and a block of 1.8m 'A' shares had traded at 75p just before
the close of business. The broker has been acting for HongKong Land to raise

FT  13 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: FDA hits drug blue chip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUND managers specialising in the health and household sector, already
reeling this week from two doses of bad news affecting Glaxo, the drug
market's former glamour stock, were given another thorough shaking as
SmithKline Beecham (SB) shares fell sharply on bad news from the US.
The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) advisory committee rejected
approval of SB's Kytril, formulated as an anti-nausea drug, citing concerns
about side-effects.
Pharmaceuticals specialists described the rejection of approval for Kytrin
as a 'big disappointment', and said that the move was a 'significant knock
to confidence in the stock'. He said Kytrin is one of a handful of 'key new
drugs' for SB. He also pointed out that the FDA move was seen by the market
as a delay rather than total rejection. Another bear point for SB shares was
an article in the British Medical Journal which highlighted a review of
anti-depressant drugs, favouring existing preparations over newer drugs,
including SB's Paxil.
SB shares, heavily supported over the week as big international funds
switched out of Glaxo and into SB, tumbled to 466p before steadying and
closing a net 21 1/2 off at 469 1/2 p. Turnover in the ordinaries totalled a
hefty 6.2m shares.
The overall market decline and yet more selling pressure from the US put
paid to any hopes of a revival in Glaxo shares, which dipped to 656p before
stabilising and settling a net 3 off at 665p.

FT  13 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,900 resists the profit-takers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT should have been no more than the widely-predicted pre-Budget shakeout
in the UK equity market was intensified yesterday by nervousness over
political developments in Russia and in Hong Kong. A market already
generally depressed took a turn for the worse in mid-afternoon when the Dow
Average opened 50 points down, and the FT-SE Index dipped to within five
points of the 2,900 mark.
However, there was little sign of significant selling pressure and London
staged a comfortable rally in late dealings as the equity market moved into
the new trading account. The final loss of 37.5 left the FT-SE Index at
2,915.9, but dealers showed little concern at the day's setback.
'Not a bad performance, for the last day of the account ahead of the
Budget,' commented a senior dealer at a US securities house. Monday morning
will bring a heavy batch of ex dividend adjustments to share prices, and
dealers are already under orders to keep trading positions in restraint
until Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, has ended his
Budget speech on Tuesday afternoon.
Nevertheless, yesterday saw a heavy setback as profits were taken. Banks,
insurances, electricals suffered significant selling pressure and Hong
Kong-orientated shares fell on the adverse political developments there.
This week has featured a heavy list of trading statements from leading UK
companies as well as unexpected developments among blue chip pharmaceuticals
and a decline in global oil prices. Yesterday's setback eliminated gains
achieved over the week, leaving the FT-SE Index 6.2 down on the week. But
over the two-week equity account, the Footsie has gained about 1.7 per cent
as increasing confidence in a recovery in the UK economy has taken the stock
market to successive new peaks.
Seaq volume slipped to 769.3m shares yesterday from the 821.9m recorded in
the previous session. Around 66 per cent of yesterday's Seaq business was in
non-Footsie stocks, slightly higher than recent daily averages as profits
were taken across the market range. Retail business has remained high this
week, returning values of Pounds 1.65bn on Thursday and Pounds 1.61bn on
Wednesday.
UK government bonds opened higher and made further progress in the second
half of the session in spite of a dull tone in US bonds. But London dealers
said that gilts had been influenced chiefly by internal market pressures and
that prices had risen yesterday in response to the disappearance of a recent
big seller.

FT  13 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALLS on the Hong Kong market, along with worries over events in Russia,
appeared to provide an opportunity for continued profit-taking in the
derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
On the last day of the equity account, trading in the March futures contract
on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,940, some 10 points below its close on
Thursday. But for a small mid-morning rally which saw the contract touch the
day's high of 2,945, continuous selling drove the contract lower for the
rest of the day.
The poor opening on Wall Street only served to increase the falls in March
but traders said 2,900 had proved a successful resistance level.
March finished at 2,917, down 33 on its previous close and around 2 ahead of
its fair value premium to cash of minus 2. Turnover was a healthy 11,062
lots.
The traded options saw total volume of 34,175 contracts, of which 15,791
lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. Forte was the busiest stock option
with a total of 3,116 contracts, followed by GEC at 2,543 lots.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Money Markets: French futures drift
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION in the money markets shifted to France yesterday, as the weaking
franc caused the short end of the French futures markets to drift downwards.
The June contract Pibor futures moved by over 30 basis points during the
day, although it later rallied to a closing level of 91.23.
Dealers said that the movement reflected the increasing tensions in the
European exchange rate mechanism, highlighted by the fall in the escudo
against the D-Mark and other currencies. The Portuguese central bank
intervened early in the day in support of the currency, raising the rate at
which liquidity is absorbed by 0.5 percentage points to 13.5 per cent.
Dealers pointed out that speculation that Portugal might be forced to
devalue in the coming weeks was continuing to weaken the French franc and
force up money market interest rates in some countries.
However, he added that the run-up to the French elections later this month
was a second factor for the slide.
'The Pibor will remain very volatile into the election and probably after
it,' he said, predicting that 'there could be some nasty days next week' in
the French money markets, with short-term interest rates likely to be
heavily squeezed in the days before the first phase of the election next
weekend.
At the longer end of the French market futures were considerably firmer,
closing slightly up at the end of the day. Dealers suggested that this was
due to speculation that the French franc could gain from any fall in the
value of the D-Mark sparked by a new crisis in Russia. 'It's Russia that is
affecting the longer end of the market, but the ERM for the shorter
periods,' said another dealer.
Elsewhere in Europe, trading in German and British money markets was
generally quiet, although the longer end of the German futures market
firmed.
With the focus in Britain now firmly fixed on Tuesday's budget, UK interbank
rates remained virtually unchanged. Although the Bank of England forecast a
shortage of Pounds 1.15bn, this was successfully taken out late in the day.
Meanwhile the downwards trend in European interest rates received another
small boost when the Irish Central Bank cut the rate at which it lends to
commercial banks by 0.5 of a percentage point to 11.5 per cent.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc under strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European exchange rate mechanism suffered new tensions again yesterday
after the Portuguese escudo fell to a record low against the D-Mark,
triggering a slide in the French franc, writes Gillian Tett.
In early trading the escudo weakened to Es94.00 per D-Mark, down from its
opening position of Es92.50 per D-Mark. The fall was triggered by the
previous night's resignation of Mr Antonio Borges, the vice president of the
Portuguese bank, and rumours that Mr Miguel Beleza, the governor might
follow suit.
However, heavy intervention by the bank, which purchased the escudo at
Es93.50 per mark, and raised a key interest rate by 0.5 per cent, later
arrested its fall. The currency finally closed around Es92.47.
Many dealers continued to predict further falls, with some suggesting that
if the Bundesbank did not lower German interest rates at its council meeting
next Thursday, the Portuguese government could be forced to devalue by as
much as 10 per cent.
The strains on the escudo spilled over to other ERM currencies.
'It is yet another crack in the ERM, and the indirect effect of this has
been to weaken the French franc,' explained Mr Michael Feeny, market analyst
at Sumitomo Bank.
The French franc weakened from an an opening position of DM3.397. Although
the Bank of France was understood to have intervened heavily to prevent it
falling through the DM3.4 benchmark, it closed in European trading at
DM3.402.
The Spanish peseta also fell slightly on the escudo's weakness, closing
against the D-Mark at Pta 71.34, down from Pta 71.24.
With uncertainty ahead of the French elections likely to raise the pressure
on the franc, some dealers predicted that tensions over the ERM could grow
next week.
'Next week is a pivotal week,' commented Mr Avinash Persaud, currency
economist with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The dollar and D-Mark traded in a narrow band, with the dollar closing in
Europe slightly up on the previous day.
Although the political crisis in Russia continued to undermine the D-Mark,
this was being partly offset by the tensions within the ERM itself, dealers
said.
Meanwhile the Swiss franc continued to make steady gains against the D-Mark,
closing up at DM1.094.
'The Swiss franc has been the main beneficiary of the safe haven status in
the Russian crisis,' said Mr Feeny. He pointed out that it had also
benefited from the recent Italian turmoil, which has weakened the lira.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Profits roll in - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DIRECTORS are seizing the opportunity of a buoyant stock market to take some
very significant profits on their shareholdings. A classic example is
Gresham Telecomputing. Michael Whitaker bought 600,000 shares at 10p last
year, just before they started to motor. Since then, directors have taken
profits repeatedly; Whitaker himself sold 100,000 at 56p earlier this year.
The latest sales by Steve Purhase and Sidney Green were of 1m and 2m at 75p;
they retain almost 50m between them.
Tadpole Technology came to the market in December last year when the shares
were placed at 65p. Its share price performance since then has been little
short of staggering. With the company already capitalised at Pounds 56m,
Howard Kitchner, a non-executive director, has sold 100,000 shares at 308p.
Four weeks ago, he sold a total of 72,000 at around 290p, but he still holds
660,000.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Chattels are the goods - Jennie
Hawthorne tells how you can minimise liability to gains tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE HAWTHORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS looking for exemptions from capital gains tax often overlook the
personal effects known as chattels. These comprise tangible moveable
property such as furniture, jewellery, diamonds, silver, and collectibles
like books, paintings and stamps. Wasting chattels, with an estimated life
of less than 50 years - for example, a boat or car (not used for business) -
are excluded from CGT altogether.
Even if you do not have a Cezanne in the attic or a Georgian silver tea set
in the cellar, you have possibly acquired other possessions over the years.
These could well have appreciated in value despite the recession. No matter
whether such items came to you through inheritance or by shrewd or lucky
purchases - if they can be classed as chattels, gains made on them are
treated benignly by the Inland Revenue.
If you sell chattels for Pounds 6,000 or less, you pay no CGT at all. If the
proceeds exceed Pounds 6,000, your capital gain is restricted to five-thirds
of the excess. So, a set of apostle spoons that cost Pounds 500 and sold for
Pounds 6,300 will show a capital gain equal to five-thirds of the excess
over Pounds 6,000: that is, Pounds 500.
The mathematics mean that, for very large disposals, you are better off
under the normal rules relating to chargeable gains. But husbands and wives
each can claim the chattels exemption in addition to the usual CGT exemption
for sales of other assets on which the profit does not exceed Pounds 5,800
in the tax year 1992-1993.
The past few years have brought more losses than gains for many people and
even private homes, once considered a bedrock of security, have fallen in
value. But this is not always true of their contents.
An old kitchen dresser picked up for a few pounds could now be worth a few
hundred. A much-loved silver or dressing-table set, perhaps handed down by
granny, can sometimes fetch around Pounds 1,000 today.
And first editions, which may grace your bookshelves or those of your
parents, are in great demand and often sell for two or three times their
purchase price.
Kenneth Fuller, of Marchpane - located in the internationally-famous
antiquarian bookshop niche of London's Cecil Court - says a first (1930s)
edition of PG Wodehouse, selling for around Pounds 100 in 1987, now costs
around Pounds 400-Pounds 500. A first London edition of Alice in Wonderland,
which could be bought for Pounds 200-Pounds 500 in 1987, now costs Pounds
1,000-Pounds 2,000.
But the real icing on the cake is that when your possessions consist of
silverware, furniture, books, or any other of the items classed as chattels,
each of them can qualify individually for the Pounds 6,000 gains tax
exemption. The exception is when they make up a set.
What constitutes a set is a somewhat grey area and difficult to define,
according to Timothy Sammons, a director of Sotheby's. The Revenue says:
'Whether a number of articles constitute a set is a question to be decided
in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of each case. Six
matching chairs or a canteen of Georgian silver cutlery would prima facie
constitute a set.'
Thus, if a set of chairs which cost you Pounds 6,000 was sold for Pounds
12,000, there would be gains tax to pay (ignoring indexation) on the balance
over Pounds 6,000. If you sold six individual non-matching chairs for Pounds
2,000 each, you would pay no tax on any of them. That might, however, be
considered a trading transaction that incurs other taxes.
The best rule for taking advantage of the chattels exemption is to buy only
what you enjoy and can afford, and sell only when you must. The Inland
Revenue won a victory this week with a ruling by the House of Lords in the
Smith v Schofield case.
In 1952 Mrs Schofield inherited two pieces of furniture which she sold for
considerable profit in 1987. At issue was the order in which two reliefs
from CGT should be given, namely indexation allowance, which removes
post-1982 inflationary gains from the charge to tax, and time-apportionment
which is a method of exempting gains accruing before April 1965, when CGT
was introduced.
The Law Lords decided that indexation allowance should be applied before
time apportionment, which will reduce the benefit of indexation allowance.
Richard Rees-Pulley of Ernst &amp; Young which, with other accountants, was
involved in the case said: 'It is wholly unjust that a portion of
inflationary gains will be taxed as a result of this decision. As the Lords
have previously said, CGT is a tax on real gains. The government should take
urgent action to amend retrospectively the legislation to give proper
indexation relief.'

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Following Footsie - News in Brief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL &amp; Provincial is offering a second version of its Guaranteed Equity
Reserve account. This links the return to the rise in the FT-SE 100 index
over five years, with a guarantee of investors' money back if the index
falls.
As with most other products in this field, the investor receives no benefit
from the dividend yield on the Footsie, a significant component of return
over five years. The final return will be based on the average of the
Footsie over the last six months of the five-year period.
N&amp;P quotes a gross rate of 133.33 per cent of the growth of Footsie, but
this is available only to non-taxpayers. Basic rate-payers will get 100 per
cent of the rise; higher rate-payers will get 80 per cent and probably would
be better off in an indexed unit trust. Bonuses for early investment will
increase these returns slightly.
Withdrawals are allowed after one year but subject to penalties. If Footsie
has failed to rise, you will lose 5 per cent of your capital; if it has
increased, you will receive 50 per cent of the rise (for basic rate-payers)
and 40 per cent of the rise (for top rate-payers).
The minimum investment is Pounds 500 and the issue will close on May 31.
*****
PRIVATE investors looking for information on companies - including profit,
earnings per share figures and brokers' forecasts - can, in addition to the
sources we mentioned last week, consider the Earnings Guide. A monthly
booklet costs Pounds 270 a year and a weekly guide, for use on a personal
computer, is Pounds 1,200 plus VAT. Further details from Earnings Guide, PO
Box 1, Horsham, West Sussex, RH12 3YY.
*****
ENTERPRISE Zone investments, which allow full tax relief at the investor's
top marginal rate of tax, have gone quiet this year. At one point, they
seemed likely to overtake the business expansion scheme.
The latest offering is less glamorous than previous offerings involving
Olympia &amp; York, but probably less risky: it will buy cold storage units in
Scunthorpe. Collect 1, sponsored by Terrace Hill Capital and managed by
Property Enterprise Managers, will buy land in the Scunthorpe Enterprise
Zone on which 63,500 sq ft of warehousing is being built. There is an agreed
27-year lease to Scunthorpe Cold Stores, with a projected rental yield of 8
per cent. Rent is underwritten by the Dibdin Group, which has assets of
Pounds 19m. There is no external bank guarantee, and money has been put
aside to pay the first three years' rent, plus up to two years' rent after
that if necessary.
Minimum investment is Pounds 5,000, with a total capacity of Pounds 5.25m.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Travel: Beware of pelicans crossing - JDF Jones tells you
how to avoid large numbers of Germans and rampant commercialism in Crete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE WERE delayed in Siteia because the town's pet pelican climbed on to the
roof of our Fiat and refused to get down for half an hour.
There was nothing we could do. You cannot accelerate down the road with a
pelican on the roof; you hesitate to take a cudgel to him, or tip him into
the ditch, because he is the size of a five-year-old child and evidently of
an amiable disposition.
He stretched his great scaly neck over the windscreen, gazed at me with eyes
as old as Tithonus, and tapped on the glass in a welcoming manner as he
posed for the ever-lengthening queue of German tourists. Then he left his
signature on the roof.
Pedro the pelican will have to serve as symbol in today's Greece: something
to do with the visitor's difficulty in getting away from the hoi polloi.
That sounds a snobbish way of putting it, but the problem has to be
confronted head-on and I know that my Greek friends would wish me to call a
spade a spade.
The fact is that the Greek tourist industry has become so successful over
the past dozen years that the particular delights and wonders of the
country, as savoured by the traditional traveller for a century and more,
appear to be in serious jeopardy.
Greece these days - it is tempting to believe, especially in the shock of
first-time arrival - is a mess, a shambles, a spiralling descent into the
ugly vulgarity of mass tourism.
The country's extraordinary natural beauty is being disfigured fast by
uncontrolled ribbon development; the Aegean beaches, once empty, are
crammed, noisy and, too often, filthy; the villages are dedicated to
'English breakfast all day' and T-shirt boutiques; the greatest sites of
antiquity, which not so long ago were visited by only hundreds in a year,
now have to cope in season with thousands every day; the islands are alive
with the sound of Walkmen.
Is it true? Does it matter? And, if it is halfway true, is there anything we
can do about it?
Let us take Crete, as one example . . .
Crete is the largest, the mythically-richest, the most diverse and, some
would say, the most beautiful of the Greek islands. It can no longer be
denied that a long stretch of the northern coastline has now been colonised
by the package tour, with all that implies.
There is nothing necessarily 'wrong' with this. From Heraklion eastward to
Ayios Nikolaos the beaches are, mainly, good; the weather is superb; the
mountain backdrop is as ravishing as you could wish; and the tourist
industry has been developed to such a high point of professionalism that it
takes account of every pocket. But it does not have much to do with Crete
any more, and the strip between Hersonissos and Mallia provides traffic jams
and featureless concrete to rival anything on the Costas or the Algarve. It
caters, however, to a market that knows what it wants - and what it does not
want.
The Robinson Club at Lyttos Beach, outside Hersonissos, is a perfectly good
 -indeed, superior - example. Robinson's is a world-wide German version of
Club Med. The overwhelming majority of its 750 guests are German-speaking
and they are looking not for a 'Greek experience' but for a corner of a
Mediterranean field that is forever Germany: sea, sun, sport, lots of good
food at northern meal-times, and all put together with clockwork efficiency.
It is not surprising that many of the guests never go out of the
(securely-guarded) gates. Most of the clients are not interested in being in
Greece - Crete - as opposed to a sandbank in the Caribbean or a high-walled
beach estate in Spain. They have a perfect right to be uninterested in a
Greek experience. Need that matter?
The same point would apply to much of this north-east part of the island.
There are luxury hotels in the area, especially at Elounda, near Ayios
Nikolaos. My own favourite is the Elounda Beach, where you must insist on a
water's-edge stone cabin so that you look out towards Spinalonga's leper
fortress over the deep and shifting seas as if from the bridge of a ship.
The only snag at Elounda Beach is that it is a touch too big for its own
style; this means the food is nothing special. Again, though, you can forget
easily that you are in Greece and that King Minos lived with Zeus in a big
cave up on the horizon . . .
Crete is large enough to have a splendid expressway to whizz you across the
northern coast but, all along it, the signs of commercial development are
inescapable. Take the village of Yeoryoupolis, a long way west towards
Khania. With a lazy character of its own (and an immense beach), it was a
hot tip from the regulars. Now, though, it is showing alarming signs of
transformation. You must always, in Crete, beware of any development which
uses 'Minos' in its title.
So, what can we do to be saved? The answers are perfectly simple.
Get away from the coastal strip. This is a big, as well as a beautiful,
island. Five miles inland and you are at once in the lush Cretan landscape
of olive grove and orchard, cicadas and goat bells, set against the rolling
black silhouette of the high mountains. (In many of the Aegean islands, try
going five miles inland and you would be coming out on the beach the other
side).
Get off the expressway. The 'old' road is invariably quieter, slower, more
attractive, and full of those intimacies of local life which motorways are
built to by-pass.
Make that slight extra effort to go beyond the deck chairs and the beach
boys. Less than a mile beyond the crowds of Mallia beach, for instance, is a
1700 BC Minoan palace. There are renovated museums in Rethymnon and Siteia
which put to shame the confusion (and crowds) in that great treasure house
of the Archaeological Museum in Heraklion. Sir Arthur Evans' brave
reconstructions at Knossos are only three miles from Heraklion, which says
something about the continuing inter-relation between Greece past and Greece
present.
Look for the unspoilt alternatives, which are far more frequent than you
might imagine if you are recoiling for the first time from the urban jungle
of Heraklion or the one-way system of Ayios Nikolaos. When you flee Mallia,
for example, take a look at Milatos or Sisi, just a few miles round the
corner.
Go to extremes. Use that expressway and take yourself off to the eastern and
western coasts. Beyond Siteia, for example, in the far east, there is a
great chunk of idyllic landscape where even the guidebooks falter and grow
thin. Again, you need to be sensible. The one place to which you do not go,
not any more, is the famous palm beach of Vai. This is indeed one of the
Mediterranean's most perfect coves. Today, though, it is packed with beach
recliners made of plastic webbing and you must pay 50 drax to visit the
lavatory. I promise that you need drive only a few miles from Vai to find
empty sand beaches, waterside tavernas where your fish left the water only
minutes ago, secret olive groves and Minoan hill sanctuaries.
A bit further down the coast, you have the Minoan harbour palace of Zakros,
at the foot of a gorge and on the edge of the beach, with a spanking new
approach road to make it easy. Then you should head back inland, on to the
hills and down twisting lanes until you emerge again on the south coast -
and still never a sign of your fellow men.
My message is that Greece is indeed under threat but all is not lost. Until
the valley below Delphi is built over with retirement bungalows, or Crete's
Lassithi plateau becomes a golf course, damage will remain irritating but
superficial.
The essential Greece remains, for those prepared to look for it and to make
a few concessions in that search. But steer clear of Siteia's pelican. Avis
is still trying to scrub the mess off the roof.
Places are available on an FT tour of Crete from May 6-16, with
archaeologist Gerald Cadogan. The tour is being organised on the FT's behalf
by Cox &amp; Kings Travel (see advertisement on Page XII).

FT  13 MAR 93 / Travel: Greek delight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE IS another way to seek out the authentic, unspoiled Greece, and we owe
it to the country's national tourist organisation for what are termed
Traditional Settlements.
The idea is splendid and simple. In different parts of the country,
particularly the more remote and less 'commercially-attractive' regions  -
such as the Mani deep in the Peloponnese - the organisation has acquired and
renovated historic buildings and turned them into 'guest houses.'
They are not intended to be as ambitious or sophisticated as the paradors of
Spain or the posadas of Portugal, but they have perfectly acceptable modern
facilities to go with their simple, white walls, locally-crafted wooden
furniture and rich, warm textiles. The buildings are a delight after the
anonymous concrete of so many Greek hotels. They are, by definition, sited
magnificently.
In the Mani, for example, the most dramatic towers in the famous hilltop
view of Vathia turn out to be a Traditional Settlement, and you will have a
positive suite of higgledy-piggledy rooms quite unlike any motel in which
you ever stayed. At the other end of the country, in the forests and
orchards of the Pelion, Makrinitsa has three elegant, 18th century mansions
perched on the mountain peninsula north of Volos.
Back in the Peloponnese, Monemvasia - a sort of Greek Gibraltar - has a
renovated former monastery deep within the walls of the traffic-free
Venetian fortress. Offshore, the Traditional Settlements extend to Psara
(near Chios), to Chios itself, and to a larger group of neo-classical
mansions on Santorini.
This is as far as you can get from the styles of mass tourism; yet, because
the guest houses remain modest, they do not have the limitations of the
five-star, high-luxury alternative which is uncongenial to many of us. But a
hire car is essential.

Street, London Wl. Tel: 071-734-5997. Several UK travel firms handle the

FT  13 MAR 93 / Everest: the ultimate high - Rebecca Stephens sets off in
the steps of Everest's first climbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REBECCA STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HUNT, the veteran mountaineer, looked at me gently. 'Everest was not my
favourite mountain,' he said 'And I doubt, my dear, it will be yours.'
Only three years ago at mount Everest's base camp, I met four French women
who I thought were, quite simply, mad for wanting to reach the 29,028ft
peak. Surely women had more sense. Women wanted to create life and preserve
it, not throw it away for a mountain, I thought. But this week I am on my
way to Everest to face the same dangers as they did in an attempt on the
summit.
Our expedition is intended to mark the 40th anniversary of the first ascent
of Everest by the British expedition led by Colonel John Hunt. It has been
endorsed by Sir Edmund Hilary, who, with Sherpa Tensing, was the first to
reach that majestic peak on 29 May 1953. Our team - the DHL British 40th
Anniversary Everest Expedition - will climb by the same route they took, by
the Western Cwm and South Col.
We aim to raise Pounds 1m for Sir Edmund's Himalayan Trust, a charity which
helps build schools and hospitals for the Sherpa people, and conserve their
The expedition will cost some Pounds 250,000. Sponsors include DHL, New
York-based investment banking group The Carter Organization, Sally Ferries,
Glenmorangie, Foundation for Sport and the Arts and, clothing us head to
toe, Karrimor. After two years of preparation we set off this week from
Kathmandu to trek through the foothills to Everest base camp. In April we
shall set up camps high on the mountain aiming to climb, weather allowing,
in May.
The expedition, the idea of merchant banker Peter Earl and led by John
Barry, a mountaineer of some repute, is nine climbers strong. It includes
names such as Bill Barker, Harry Taylor, both Everest veterans, Dave Walsh,
Dave Halton, John Rowe and Dr Sandy Scott.
I am going as an amateur. In the autumn of 1989 I was at Everest Base Camp
reporting for the Financial Times on an Anglo-American attempt on the North
East Ridge. I did not climb; had never climbed. But since then I have become
quietly obsessed, abandoning holidays on the beach for the hillier parts of
Africa, Europe - climbing Mount Kenya, Kilimanjaro and Mont Blanc - and most
recently Alaska, where the Everest gang climbed north America's highest, and
coldest peak, Mount McKinley. The addiction takes a hold, like any drug.
And now I want to be the first British woman to reach the top of Everest.
What is it about the mountain that still draws climbers four decades after
the first ascent?
'Everest became rather more than a mountain,' Hunt says. 'It is so easy to
idealise our expedition, but there was enormous pressure to be the first
expedition - and a British one at that - to climb the mountain. All the more
so because following the war we were preceded (on the mountain) by the Swiss
and to be followed by the French.'
Hunt, and he suggests most of the 1953 team, agreed with the words of Eric
Shipton - who until six months earlier had been leader of the expedition -
when, on hearing of their success, said: 'Thank Goodness, now we can get on
with some real climbing.'
In the last 40 years 469 men and 16 women have stood on the summit of
Everest; 117 have died in attempts to do so. Man has climbed it solo,
without oxygen, and in May of last year 32 people queued to stand on the
summit on a single day.
Is the climb easier? Has Everest shrunk? Or is it that modern equipment  -
Gore-tex, quick-wicking fabrics which allow perspiration to escape, plastic
boots, light-weight oxygen cylinders - and an advancement in the
understanding of high altitude physiology has enabled climbers to overcome
the effects of the drastic reduction in ambient oxygen levels and the
associated susceptibility to the cold?
'It's easy to overplay the difference in equipment. I think we were well
equipped,' said Hunt; though undoubtedly the net weight of clothing and
oxygen then was considerably higher than it is today.
'Stoves were important,' he said; a comment that reveals quite how
experimental such things were in the 1950s. The Swiss failed in 1952 because
their stoves failed. The Brits knew this, and made sure that their stoves
could melt enough snow to enable each climber to drink at least seven pints
of liquid a day. It was revolutionary knowledge then, that it might be
essential to consume large quantities of liquid at high altitude; today it
is part of traditional mountaineering wisdom.
The biggest difficulty to overcome on that first ascent was, said Hunt, 'the
psychological problem.'
To enter the Western Cwm climbers must first clamber up the Khumbu Icefall:
2,000ft of gaping crevasses and shifting monoliths of ice, that collapse and
tumble with a whim.
'Terrifying,' said Lincolne Rowe, an artist accompanying us on the
expedition, who twice has been high on Everest. 'I can say so; I'm an
artist.'
In Hunt's day it had been passed only twice: 'It was a real hazard to be
reckoned with.'
A greater problem still was the last 1,000ft or so to the summit: 'There was
that uncertainty about man's ability to do it. The Sherpas suffered
especially from those doubts, and their superstitions that they should incur
the wrath of the gods for venturing above the South Col.'
It was a sacred summit: 'The monks at Thyangboche Monastery (in the
foothills) quite clearly didn't want us to get to the top,' said Hunt.
On the climbers' return the monks congratulated them - for 'nearly reaching
the summit.'
How different today: Ang Phurbar, the head Sherpa on our expedition, has
reached the summit twice. The barrier of doubt is down.
Might a woman have been invited to climb Everest in 1953?
'Inconceivable,' said Hunt. 'Had there been a girl she would have been one
of us - that would be natural, normal,' he reflected. But there were very
few male climbers then, and especially few women climbers.
When the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme - of which Lord Hunt was a founding
director - opened its doors to girls in 1958, it was considered their
preferred pursuits might be make-up and hair-style, dress design and flower
arranging, not motorcycle maintenance or potholing. This spring, eight young
people from the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme - boys and girls - are
accompanying us to Base Camp Everest, each one climbing Island Peak
(20,380ft) en route.
In 1953, Hunt's expedition had Everest to themselves. This spring there will
be some 20 expeditions on the south side of the mountain alone. But as Hunt
chose to entitle his loosely autobiographical book, Life is Meeting. He, and
Ed Hillary, George Lowe, George Band and Michael Westmacott will be
rekindling their 40 year friendship at a 1953 Everest reunion in Khumbu this
spring. With luck, we will meet them; and the old Everest hands will be able
to throw a tips to nine modern-day aspirants, as they trek by.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Point of dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN

<TEXT>
REMOTE and ancient, it rises out of the sea, in the shadow of the 1,500 ft
peak of Roineval on the south east corner of Harris - a rocky headland like
thousands in the Scottish Hebrides.
But Lingarabay point is not the same as all the others. Its special
qualities mean it might be blown apart, pulverised and sold by the shipload
as high grade aggregate in south east England, Germany and the Netherlands.
In its place, when all the dust and noise has gone, will be a sea loch more
than a mile square, but not a loch like all the others . . .
This grand scheme has caused an outcry from environmentalists. Yet it could
bring prosperity to the island and alleviate pressures on the environment in
the south of England where lobby groups have almost paralysed big mineral
working applications.
Scotland, with its tradition of industrial extraction, less people and more
space, may be a distant location from which to haul material, but royalties
instead of Pounds 3.50 a tonne are nearer 10p.
Lingarabay is the only large and accessible British deposit of the rock
anorthosite, which is especially hard and heavy. Can its removal, and
substitution with a sea loch be balanced with prevailing philosophies of
land use?
The government's commitment to sustainable development of natural resources
is in difficulty when the resource is being developed by being deported. But
language has been tortured to meet political ends before.
The matter of scenery, the Highlands core appeal, presents another teaser.
Who is to say the sea loch left behind will not be pretty too? The only
superquarry presently operating in the Highlands, at Glensanda on Loch
Linnhe, has hollowed out a mountain from behind and inside, leaving main
profiles intact.
Calnum MacDonald, MP for the Western Isles, thinks most local people would
support the quarry plan if the terms were sufficiently generous. But all the
expected national conservation bodies oppose the Lingarabay superquarry.
the owner of the underlying mineral rights, civil engineer Ian Wilson,
presents the superquarry plan as an opportunity not a blight, and a possible
saviour of the Outer Isles. He sees the quarry dust from pulverising rocks,
not as a silicosis-carrying pollutant, but as a valuable mineral which,
mixed with lime, could restore fertility to the island's tired and acid
topsoils.
Wilson says the quarry would bring jobs in a depopulated area, stop young
people emigrating, and fund a local enterprise zone. It would also provide
him with a royalty on each tonne, which, with a production forecast of 10m
tonnes a year, should not slip out of the equation.
d4
What makes this dispute so evocative is the pristine beauty of the site, the
dearth of local employment, and the sheer scale of the plans.
Financial sweeteners are being proffered to the community council and the
mining company has already offered a local concession - no working on the
Sabbath.
The Western Isles Council, its finances shattered by its investments in
BCCI, is considering the application. Coastal superquarries have already
been embraced by the regional council's structure plan. The Secretary of
State for Scotland has asked that the decision, to be referred to him. With
four other coastal superquarries in the Highlands being planned, Lingarabay
will be seen as a test-case.
Most commercial developments in the Highlands are opposed by retired people
or getaway types with no interest in local employment. Take the case of
farmed salmon cages disfiguring sea lochs, one white settler (English
immigrant) declared the uninterrupted sea-view was 'a right', Which shows,
perhaps, how the view colours the viewer.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Property: Swiss snap up Joel's stud - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week, Gerald Cadogan, the Weekend FT's newly-appointed residential
property correspondent, starts a fortnightly column of news and views on the
property market:
GOOD NEWS for British racing, as the Cheltenham Festival nears, is that
Swiss connections of the Marquesa de Moratalla have bought the late Jim
Joel's stud at Childwick Bury, Hertfordshire.
Joel bred many famous horses including Royal Palace, Fairy Footsteps and
Light Cavalry. The Marquesa, who owns Sybillin and The Fellow, currently
Gold Cup favourite, may increase her involvement in racing there. Agents
Strutt &amp; Parker have not disclosed the sum. In September, when Childwick
came on the market, the guide price was Pounds 2.5m.
In Ireland, at Cashel, Co. Tipperary, the late Percy Harris's Athassel Stud
will be auctioned on March 31. Its best known winners are Double Jump and
Maelstrom Lake. The early Victorian house comes with several yards, 40 loose
boxes and 93 acres. The guide price, a fraction of Childwick's, is more than
Pounds 350,000, or over Pounds 200,000 for the house alone and 28 acres.
Agents in Dublin are Hamilton Osborne King (01-676-0251).
The pop world comes to market. Dave Stewart, of the Eurhythmics, is selling
his London home in Randolph Avenue, Maida Vale. The house, on offer from
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) at around Pounds 500,000 freehold,
looks traditional enough from the outside. Inside the stairs and halls are
painted with trompe l'oeil urns and ruins.
Near Rickmansworth, in Hertfordshire, John Reid, manager of Elton John, is
selling Lockwell House, built in 1911. It has masses of rooms, 15 acres and
the trimmings we expect of showbiz - a newly-built leisure complex with
gymnasium, sauna and billiard room (complete with film screen descending
from the ceiling), tennis court, swimming pool and floodlit helicopter pad.
It could be yours for around Pounds 1.95m, through Savills (071-499-8644).
At the opposite extreme a sixth-floor studio, with bathroom and kitchenette,
in a portered block in Grosvenor Street, London W1 would be ideal for a
regular visitor who does not want to pay hotel bills. And the price?
Chestertons Residential (071-629-4513) invites best offers over Pounds
40,000 by noon on Thursday March 18.
The following day best offers over Pounds 200,000 close for a Grade II manor
house at Bittadon Barton in north Devon, with John Smale in Barnstaple
(0271-42000) and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Exeter (0392-433033). It is a 17th
century building with splendid outbuildings but needs money spent on it. The
agents have found that informal tendering works well for properties needing
investment and two recent properties in Devon have easily exceeded the guide
price.
For the last six weeks anyone wanting to repair a property but needing
access via a neighbour's land, has been able to apply to the courts for an
access order. The Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992 allowing people on to
others' land to carry out basic preservation to their own property, came
into in force on January 31. Simmons &amp; Simmons (071-628-2020) has issued a
note explaining how it works entitled Love Thy Neighbour.
Halifax Building Society has published its second House Names Survey. The
top five, with the first three the same as in 1988, are: The Bungalow; The
Cottage; Rose Cottage; The Lodge and Hillcrest. Shangri La, Chez Nous and
Casa Mia are still popular, but Dunroamin is restricted to Scotland, south
east England and Yorkshire.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Property: Where have all the aunties gone? - Rambling old
houses can gain from the extended family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN NORTH-WEST England house styles are diverse; from the brick houses and
the black and white half-timbered confections of Cheshire, to the rough
stone cottages of the Lake District, there is property to suit all tastes.
The M6 and its connecting motorways hold the region together, making it easy
to travel south or across the Pennines to Yorkshire or further north to
Scotland. Manchester's newly-enlarged airport is another plus for the
region.
For amusement and culture the choice is equally varied; from Blackpool
illuminations to the museums and galleries of Manchester and Liverpool. And
do not miss the treats in smaller civic collections, bought with profits
derived from the heyday of Lancashire's cotton industry.
Sportswise you are spoilt for choice; football, rugby league, cricket at Old
Trafford, the Grand National at Aintree, lake sailing, fell walking, fox
hunting or pony trekking are on offer. That will stimulate your appetite for
a farm tea - or dinner at Sharrow Bay, Ullswater - as you rest your limbs
and dream of Wordsworth, daffodils, Beatrix Potter and Ruskin.
Winter life in the Lake District can be far from a dream. Most cottages and
houses are built low to be out of the wind, the cottages usually dug into
the bank and tucked under the fell. They look idyllic in summer. But winter
means clouds hanging on the hills, and down in the dip no sun for weeks on
end. Can you survive that?
Flash flood becks appear after a downpour and are through the back door
before you can blink. Are you prepared? Before buying, check carefully the
direction the house faces - north may be too gloomy - and find how much
rainfall that particular part of the lake has, as it can vary sharply within
a few miles.
In summer be ready for tourist traffic; cars take maybe 25 minutes to get
through Ambleside. If you still want the lakes and a traditional cottage,
then Side Cottage at Patterdale - Lowther Scott-Harden at around Pounds
190,000 - is a charming example. In the next price band the company offers
the attractive white-painted 19th century Garth House at Skirwith in the
Eden Valley at around Pounds 225,000, and the solidly Victorian Lane Hall at
Weasdale for Pounds 265,000.
Sparket Mill, at Hutton John near Ullswater, a complete water mill with a
kiln for roasting corn that worked until the 1970s (mostly oats for
oatmeal), up to 20 acres, and fishing rights in the beck (trout and
sometimes salmon), is on offer at over Pounds 250,000. It is a surprise that
the agents still suggest that larger houses have a use as country house
hotels, since so many have ended up in receivership.
An alternative might be the use of such homes for extended families. If only
they could manage to unite and move back to use them as they were intended.
But where have all the maiden aunts gone?
Turn-of-the-century Fayrer Holme at Bowness-on-Windermere has 11 bedrooms
(10 with their own bathrooms), and planning permission for a hotel. Cluttons
offers it at around Pounds 695,000, and similarly the Georgian Rusland Hall
near Newby Bridge at Pounds 850,000.
Rusland is where the author Arthur Ransome, of Swallows and Amazons fame, is
buried. More intriguing, and cheaper at Pounds 295,000, is Thackwood Nook
near Carlisle, dating from 1681 and one of the two remaining Red Spear
houses in the country. These were armed manors the local yeomanry held
against border attacks.
In Staffordshire the superb Grade I Elizabethan/Carolean black and white
Broughton Hall that belonged to the Delves Broughton family is now owned by
an order of nuns who have made its 20 bedrooms into 34. Broughton could also
become a hotel. Strutt &amp; Parker offers it at around Pounds 750,000, with a
cottage for about Pounds 125,000 more.
In Cheshire, Pinfold House (in brick) at Marthall comes with masses of
stabling and a handy position for Manchester and the airport. Meller
Braggins offers it with Jackson-Stops for about Pounds 695,000. A cheaper
house with stables is Granary Farm, at Hawarden (Gladstone's country), 10
years old, in traditional style, and with a jacuzzi (Strutt &amp; Parker, around
Pounds 250,000).
More austere than either of these is the imposing Grade II* 17th century
Alvanley Hall near Chester, built of stone to make clear its importance
(Jackson-Stops, around Pounds 250,000).

FT  13 MAR 93 / Fashion: Hats off to the City sober-sides - Dressing for the
Professions / The Banker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD RAWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a fool would pretend that how you dress does not matter. And nowhere is
it more important than in the workplace, where your clothes send out a clear
message to colleagues and clients. Every profession has its own nuances. To
the outsider they may seem arcane, even pointless; to the insider they show
fine distinctions of attitude. Here Richard Rawlinson, in the first of a new
series, cracks the code of City Man - and City Woman.
THE CITY'S equivalent of the bra-burning woman of the 1960s was the merchant
banker who left his bowler hat at home. In the City of London, social
revolution stands aside for subtle evolution. But evolve it does, and the
transition from the extravagant Eighties to the nervous Nineties is as
clearly defined as the stripes on a New &amp; Lingwood shirt.
Gone are the wide red braces inspired by Gordon 'greed is good' Gekko of the
film Wall Street. Gone, too, are the brashly-coloured silk linings of
power-shouldered suits. The popular image of the yuppie, making easy money
over the mobile telephone while driving his Porsche down the Strand for a
four-hour lunch at the Savoy, is now a distant symbol of the Thatcher
decade.
The Square Mile of today is a much more sober place than it was a few years
ago. A combination of enduring recession and a string of high-profile fraud
scandals has transformed bankers into a more humble breed, reflected by
their increasingly sedate dress codes.
The cult of the individual is eschewed in favour of faceless, corporate
operators. When a young and snappy Warburg Securities employee inadvertently
appeared in a photograph on the front page of the Financial Times at the
launch of the British Telecom privatisation, he was reprimanded by a
superior. Flamboyant dressers are suspected of egotism and rebellion and,
with fewer jobs on the market, bankers can see the sense of keeping a low
profile and presenting themselves to clients as studious advisers.
Bold pinstripes have been toned down to chalkstripes or to navy or grey
herring-bones and grey birds-eyes. Prince of Wales checks, which crept in
among a few daring bankers in the 1980s, are now reinstated as spectator
sportswear. If any British banker envied US counterparts at Goldman Sachs
and Chase Manhattan their summer suits in cool cotton tan, they have now
lost all hope of ever being accepted at work in such informal attire.
Wide striped shirts have also given way to narrow stripes or plains in pale
blues, pinks and creams. Classic gold cufflinks are now prefered to the
frivolous Mickey Mouse links of yesteryear. Gentlemanly grey socks have
replaced the once familiar flash of garish colour between polished, black
Church's shoes and trouser turn-ups. Only ties remain as the last bastion of
self-expression, with circus animal prints by Hermes - or imitations by
Thomas Pink - replacing polka dots and paisleys as the ultimate in City
chic.
Lazards merchant banker Simon Pryce confirms that what was de rigeur a few
years ago is no longer acceptable. 'A colleague wears a paisley-backed
waistcoat which is considered outrageous,' he says. 'While there is still a
lot of money in the City, the emphasis is away from flaunting wealth towards
buying well-cut, well-made, classics which will last a long time.'
In a nutshell, the understated style of the traditional British gent, which
has always reigned supreme among the predominantly public school and
Oxbridge-educated City establishment, is back on top. While some younger
bankers were carried away on a wave of internationalism during the designer
decade, they have now come back to their roots.
However, it is, perhaps surprisingly, not Savile Row and Jermyn Street which
are the main beneficiaries of the preeminence of le style anglais. The
emergence of small bespoke tailoring business - usually run by enterprising
county girls operating from Fulham - are catering for busy bankers by taking
business to their offices. Similarly, mail order shirt companies such as
James Meade are increasingly popular among people who have little time for
high street shopping.
Gerry Grimstone, senior director of Schroder Wagg, has his suits made by the
similarly named Georgina Grimston, whose company employs former Savile Row
tailor Leo Costanzo, formerly of Huntsman and Henry Poole.
'People want better value for money as well as quality,' he says. 'They also
want the convenience of being fitted at work or at home instead of having to
waste a Saturday afternoon at the tailor.' Georgina Grimston's suits sell
from Pounds 600 to Pounds 800 with an extra pair of trousers, compared with
Savile Row price tags of around Pounds 1,500.
Rosemary Richards, another tailor, confirms the renewed conformity in City
dressing but adds that suggestive selling during fitting sessions can leads
to clients risking more adventurous styles. 'Most bankers say they just want
to look like everyone else in the office, but when we say that the narrower
leg is back in fashion and that single breasted suits are more popular than
double breasted ones, they often agree to experiment with cut.'
The status quo does not change very much when applied to women in the City,
even though there are fewer rules dictating their appearance. While some
overtly fashion-conscious women hold senior positions, most adhere to the
men's uniform of suits and pale shirts. These are then usually accessorised
with reassuring pearls and flat, black, patent leather court shoes.
Penny Scott, corporate finance manager at Hambros, says: 'I don't want to go
into a meeting and be noticed for ostentatious clothes. I want to be noticed
because I do what I do well. If I wore a short skirt, people would think
about my legs and not my brain.'
Scott owns eight bespoke suits ranging in colour from plain grey, blue and
olive green to a cherry red jacket with a black velvet collar which is
teamed with a black skirt. 'I may wear a dress if I am dining with clients
in the evening,' she says, 'but separates are more practical for work. They
can be mixed and matched and do not require as much dry cleaning.'
Pressure to conform is, on the whole, a cause of amusement rather than
irritation for most bankers. Anecdotes about the Square Mile's snobbery and
archaic traditions are always being exchanged. There is the one about the
new Lazards director who arrived with facial hair and was introduced as the
'currently bearded' Mr . . . . There is another about Warburgs men ordering
two suit jackets, one of which is hung permanently on their chairs so that
bosses think they are working late. They say one can spot senior figures as
they do not carry brief cases or umbrellas, leaving that to their
chauffeurs.
Considering the rampant uniformity, bankers are also remarkably interested
in each other's sartorial choices. One Cazanove employee, who wished to
remain anonymous, said that more financiers were wearing white Calvin Klein
underpants nowadays than the colourful boxer shorts prefered in the 1980s.
How did he know? 'We talk about that sort of thing in the wine bar after
work,' came the reply.
David Burns, 43, is director of the London office of Banco de Progreso in
the City and is keen on off-the-peg suits. He says: 'On the whole, as I seem
to be a standard size and I don't like spending a lot of money on what are,
after all, my working overalls. I travel a lot and generally buy my suits at
Brooks Brothers in New York where I pay somewhere between Pounds 300 and
Pounds 350 a time. But I do own a couple of Hackett's ones which cost rather
more but which I particularly like to wear when I want to look very English.
'I'm more particular about my shirts and ties. I buy my shirts from Crichton
in Elizabeth Street - their shirts are very like pukka Jermyn Street ones. I
like the colours and the fabrics and they're just Pounds 25. Some of my ties
come from Crichton, some, inevitably, from Hermes, and if I want to look
colourful my Garrick Club tie. My shoes are from Church's.
'On the whole we have to be fairly sober-suited here so there isn't too much
room for flamboyance or innovation.' David Burns is photographed wearing a

FT  13 MAR 93 / Fashion: Grunge to grab the grown-up glamour girls - The
shock value has been tamed, but faded and floppy is still the in thing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE YOU frightened of flares? Does grunge fail to grab you? If that is how
you feel about this spring's much-hyped floppy, faded look, think what it is
like for the stores which have to try and sell the clothes.
The young, who will embrace this 1970s-inspired style with open arms, will
go for a mix of chain store, DIY and second-hand. But real spending power
lies with a more sceptical, conservative market. Many will remember a
similar look from last time round and will take some convincing that they
want to wear it again. So the problem presently exercising minds among
buying and display departments is 'grunge for grown-ups - how to make it
wearable.'
Buyers for leading stores all believe that there is a market and that by
summer the customer will forsake power tailoring for a softer, layered, more
muted style - provided it is presented in a way which she finds believable.
Quite why British women of a certain age should wish to express solidarity
with a look that originated in young street musicians from Seattle and
avant-garde designers from Paris venting their anger at the consumerist
values of the late 1980s may look like one of fashion's mysteries. But it is
a classic example of the way in which trends evolve.
An idea with shock value, often politically-motivated and created by
improvisation, catches the imagination of designers with street credibility,
who use it in their collections to attract media attention. The consumer
thus becomes aware of it and, by the time it is filtered through the
modifying hands of mass-market manufacturers, she is used to seeing it and
happy to wear it.
The consumer probably knows little and cares less about its philosophical
origins but according to Ruth Chapman of Matches in Wimbledon, south west
London, an experienced filterer of trends: 'She knows something new is
happening and she wants to be in there'.
Besides which, seeming unalert to current trends could imply that you are
out of date in other areas of your life including - horrors] - your
profession, hence the pressure to adapt to the new.
The shops are under another pressure - the simple one of meeting sales
targets. It is up to them to make a radical idea irresistible to the
shopper. Geraldine James, designer separates buyer at Harrods in London, has
found this easier than expected. Initially somewhat suspicious of the grunge
look, she has found herself 're-ordering flares and flower-sprigged frocks
each week since the sale ended. People are delighted to find a really fresh
look after years of the short-skirted suit.'
The outfit she put together for us - black flares, a ruffled shirt and
patchwork sleeveless jacket - may look quite extreme but, as she points out,
it is open to many interpretations.
'You can take each element separately,' she says. 'Flares are a basic
component but try them in a soft fabric like crepe or jersey, which won't
grip your upper thigh or jut out abruptly, with a long, fitted jacket
already in your wardrobe. Look critically to check the proportions are
right. The soft shirt can go under the same jacket. Patchwork is a strong
1970s theme but a lot of people already own a plain sleeveless jacket or
waistcoat which can go with that soft shirt.'
It is, she says, a question of rethinking an existing wardrobe rather than
investing heavily in new pieces. 'Find something with a soft, lacy or
transparent effect to go under your jacket, rather than a crisp shirt. And
most people already have a flowery frock, so now think about layering it -
putting a skinny T-shirt under and a little waistcoat or cardigan over.'
For Ruth Chapman, softness is the crucial point. 'My customers will see
grunge as ease and fluidity rather than that scruffy waif-like look. The one
essential buy is a floppy cardigan or waistcoat to replace the jacket. Wear
it over soft layers, preferably chiffon, and you have a new, very feminine
look which men far prefer to power dressing. I think a smart silk cardigan
looks just as good for work as a tailored jacket. Mixed print is also a
strong look which is fine as long as you stick to two neutral colours like
black and beige or navy and white.'
At Fenwick, 'accessories make the look', according to Cathy Harris, buying
manager. 'You can go as little or as far into the 1970s thing as you want
just by adding accessories to a few basic pieces such as a print frock or
wide, soft trousers. That way you update without spending a lot.
'The basics are hats - floppy-brimmed straws or crochet berets, a long scarf
tied round head or neck, long ropes of glass beads, wire-framed or
small-lensed sunglasses and espadrilles or clogs. But whether you allude to
the style with one item or load the lot on is a matter for the individual.'
Joseph Ettedgui, of Joseph, in London's Brompton Cross, believes that the
aesthetics of proportion will win women over to the softer look. 'You only
have to try on shoes with a small platform to realise they look better with
wide, soft, maybe even flared, trousers,' he says. 'The easiest way to get
the look is with knitwear because it is so soft. We have done knitted flares
with a skimpy waistcoat top to give the right proportions. But we have also
put the same unreconstructed details, like seams on the outside, on more
conventional shapes.'
Even chain stores are on the soft and floppy bandwagon. Marks and Spencer is
doing brisk business with flares, while Principles set the tone well with a
spring brochure full of ruffle-collared jackets and soft fluted dresses.
But, as the so-called supermodels are discovering, it is not just the
clothes that set the look. 'Big hair' is definitely out, but if the prospect
of lank, centre-parted locks is just too dreary, a smooth bob to the collar
or shoulder-length looks good, as does a short feathered cut if you have the
requisite gamine bone structure.
Make-up is as soft as chiffon, with pale or brown-tinted lipstick and
plummy, Biba-esque eyeshadow colours applied with the lightest of touches.
But painted-on lower lashes and false eyelashes should remain the preserve
of those for whom the 1970s are a new trip.

FT  13 MAR 93 / How To Spend It: Pulling the rug from under your feet . . .
 -Lucia van der Post keeps her nose to the ground in search of carpets - and
finds some which are simply too interesting to go on the floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOR MANY people rugs are more than just a floor-covering
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
they are an art-form, beautiful, useful, and, once hooked, collecting them
becomes a life-long obsession.
Buying rugs is fraught with traps for the ignorant or the unwary but for
those who long to know more about them Alastair Hull and Jose
Luczyc-Wychowska have just produced a sumptuously illustrated book - Kilim,
The Complete Guide (Thames and Hudson, Pounds 36) - which looks at their
history and origins, and the varying techniques and designs that go to make
them up.
Besides being a visual guide to the multifarious designs found in these
beautiful flat-weave carpets, questions such as how to collect and care for
them and where to find a dealer have been addressed. Anyone embarking on
even the simplest purchase would do well to buy this book first.
When it comes to buying rugs it is as well to define what you really want.
Those, for instance, who are looking for attractive, affordable
floor-coverings rather than rare works of art might like to know about David
and Sarah Richardson who have set up a carpet shop in Sussex (26 Southgate,
Chichester. Tel: 0243-533025). They specialise in offering well-made,
affordable modern rugs. They do get the occasional antique and are always
happy to look out for special pieces for customers but the bulk of their
stock is modern rugs from Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan.
They buy directly From Turkey to keep the prices as low as possible and all
the rugs are made in the traditional way, hand-woven, hand-knotted, from
good quality wool using natural dyes. Some are slightly sun-faded as the
current taste runs to colourways that are gentler than the dyes.
The Richardsons buy from three main carpet-producing areas - Dosemealti
(lots of reds, blues and bottle greens with touches of ochre), Kars (in the
Armenian part of Turkey where the rugs are based on old Caucasian designs -
very bold but in soft, rather pastel colours as in the rug photographed
below right and Milas in Anatolia (here designs are often based on stylised
tree-of-life motifs or flowering diamonds within a prayer-mat format).
You could buy a small rug (4 ft by 2 1/2 ft) for about Pounds 110 while for
about Pounds 400 you could find a a 7 x 5.
Apart from the rugs, the Richardsons sell kilim covered furniture,
everything from footstools (starting at about Pounds 110) to sofas. When in
Turkey they buy worn rugs and always have a supply so that customers can
choose something to suit their own schemes.
Another supplier worth knowing about is Christopher Legge Oriental Carpets,
of 25 Oakthorpe Road, Summertown, Oxford. He is the chap to go to for old
tribal and village rugs, whether Hamadans, Belouches, Afghans, Q'ashgais,
Turkomans or Caucasians. Like everybody else, though, he has found the
supply of quality old rugs dwindling and he also sells top-class modern rugs
such as Gabbehs from Iran and those made under the Dobag project in Turkey
(Dobag being a government initiative to reintroduce traditional methods of
weaving and dying).
Prices range from small mats costing between Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 and a
large old piece selling for Pounds 5,000. In between you could find a 3 ft 4
in by 2 ft 5 in rug for Pounds 195, a 5 ft by 3 ft 7 in for Pounds 395 and
an 11 ft by 7 ft for Pounds 2,500.
Christopher Legge will also clean and restore. Cleaning costs Pounds 35 a
rug up to 24 sq ft and thereafter 50p per sq ft (plus vat).
Stothert Kilim Covering is not so much a source of kilims, more a place to
go for kilim-covered furniture. A wonderful way of using rugs that are too
old or frayed to survive underfoot, Stothert will use any of your own pieces
for covering cushions, pouffes, sofas, stools or chairs. For those who do
not happen to have any dilapidated rugs Stothert is also offering all his
designs covered in his own kilims.
As you can see from the photograph here (bottom right) the pouffes make
exceedingly attractive portable informal seating and doubles as an informal
table, as well, somewhere useful to store the magazines or newspapers, hold
the cup of coffee or rest the legs.
Kilim cushions start at Pounds 14.30 for the smallest and go on up to Pounds
56 for the largest, the pouffes start at Pounds 105 for the 18 in by 12 in
high size and up to Pounds 285 for the largest, 34 in by 14 in.
Equivalent prices if you supply your own kilim (or indeed any other fabric,
for kilims are not obligatory) are Pounds 92 and Pounds 124.
Armchairs are Pounds 725, while two-seater sofas are Pounds 1,300. For those
who have had enough of kilims, it is worth knowing that Stothert also offers
a range of tartan cushions, neatly finished and piped for prices starting at
Pounds 14.30. Stothert Kilim Covering operates from Saltcote House, Glasson
Dock, Lancaster LA2 OBS. Tel: 0524-844078.
Finally, if you have a rug or carpet, no matter how modest, that is showing
signs of wear and tear, that has suffered the usual fate of carpets in
households where real-life goes on, then you might like to know about Behar
Profex. A family business started some 80 years ago, it cleans, renovates
and restores.
While it does a lot of grand work, restoring treasured heirlooms and
valuable museum pieces (English Heritage, the National Trust, Christie's and
Sotheby's are all customers) it is equally happy to take on pieces of more
modest lineage.
The company will do everything from a simple cleaning job to a full-scale
restoration; it has restored a rug nibbled by mice, and removed stains from
a collection of Turkish rugs stained by flooding.
Prices vary according to rug size and complexity of work but the starting
price for cleaning a small rug would be about Pounds 50. Contact Behar
Profex at The Alban Building, St Albans Place, Upper Street, London N1. Tel:
071-226-0144.

FT  13 MAR 93 / How To Spend It: Open house on design solutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are interested in the latest looks for hearth and home than you might
like to know that, from March 21 to 25, 24 showrooms in Chelsea, London,
will be holding open house from 10 am to 5 pm every day. All you need to do
to join the design caravanserai is to visit any of the participating
companies - there you can ask for a pass and from then on be transported
from showroom to showroom courtesy of Vauxhall Motors.
Companies range from old-established and respected traditionalists such as
Colefax and Fowler and Nobilis-Fontan to more recent arrivals on the
decorating scene such as Jane Churchill and Beaumont &amp; Fletcher. All will be
showing the latest hot looks for the house. If you want details on Chelsea
Design Week (as it is called) write to Chelsea Design Week, 12 Hillgate
Place, London, SW12 9 ER enclosing an sae.
Heated mirrors sound like one of those simple ideas that leave one wondering
why nobody thought of it before. We all know that irritating moment after a
good hot bath or shower when we find the mirror is all steamed up, making
shaving or putting on make-up becomes hazardous.
Now Malcolm Syme has developed a range of heated mirrors - as pictured below
right - which solve the problem. Connected to the lighting circuit, each
mirror has a heating element which starts warming the glass when the light
comes on and so prevents it steaming up. They come with or without primed,
pine or 'old gold' frames, with their own Razorlight, or plain so that you
can choose a surround of your own.
Sizes are 420 mm wide by 500 mm high, 515 mm wide by 590 mm high or 420 mm
wide by 565 mm high. Prices start at Pounds 99.95 and include instructions,
two screws and one electrical connection. The mirrors are available at
Solaglas of Coventry and Dawson &amp; Gibbons, 55 Red Lion Street, London WC2 as
well as by mail from The Heated Mirror Company, Sherston, Wiltshire SN16
OLW. Tel: 0666-840003.
Traditional Belfast Sinks - solid, plain, sturdy, as pictured above right -
are much sought-after in certain decorative circles. Some prefer them
plainest of all in white but there is now a range of colours and sizes to
choose from. From the smallest, 24 in by 18 ins by 10 to the largest, 36 ins
by 18 ins by 10, they come in Delft blue, ivory, stone and cane. Prices
range from Pounds 72.64 to Pounds 180. For details contact Ceramic
Traditions, Bullers Lane, Hoddlesden, Lancashire BB3 3 NX. Tel: 0254-761500.
For those who love antique linens but have neither the time nor the know-how
to track them down Penny Kempton has the answer - she has a range of
bedlinen made to her specifications in China, all based on authentic antique
designs. Many are replicas of Edwardian and Victorian designs, all are
hand-worked and most include hand-embroidery, drawn threadwork or
crochetwork.
Penny Kempton started commissioning antique designs because of
ever-increasing prices and the difficulty in tracking down original
antiques. Everything is pure linen, which means they are not cheap but they
are good value - a linen top sheet costs Pounds 199 and a linen pillowsham
with drawnthread work and crochet edging is Pounds 34. There are embroidered
duvet covers (from Pounds 94 for a double) with matching pillowcases (from
Pounds 22 for standard, or Pounds 28 for continental size of 26 ins by 26
ins) as well as hand towels, place mats, napkins and the like. They can be
bought by mail (a free brochure is available from Penny Kempton, Antique
Designs, Orchard Farm, Antrobus, Cheshire CW9 6JY, tel: 0565 777376) or from
50 stockists in the UK. Ring Antique Designs for your nearest one.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Cheap, fresh  - and quick - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IDEA of being able to stop off on the way home from work to buy a
ready-prepared meal is appealing. Pop it into the oven, take a shower, put
your feet up with a drink and, presto, dinner is served.
That is the theory. But what separates this dream from reality is quality.
Every supermarket and high street chain now has menus that are supposed to
satisfy career-minded business people who are too tired to cook. The trouble
with mass-produced food, however, is that it is mass-produced.
Monosodium glutamate, onion powder, colourants, stabilisers and other
undesirable additives are much less rampant than they used to be, thank
goodness. Even so, chill-fresh dishes conceived in central kitchens for
network distribution tend to fall flat. Prepared on too large a scale to
bear the imprint of any one cook, and more concerned with shelf life and
uniformity than good textures and tastes, they lack any real character.
Blessed are those who live in neighbourhoods with a friendly
deli-cum-traiteur selling good hot food. Charcuterie, cheese and salads are
all very well in summer, but body and soul need something more warming in
unpredictable March.
Such shops, usually owned privately, tend to cater the way we do at home.
Fresh foods are cooked today for eating this evening. Recipes are personal
and flexible. Pots are stirred and tasted, with ingredients added and
seasonings adjusted along the way.
For those without a shop like this, self-catering seems the only solution.
The quicker the recipe, the better when the cook has already put in a hard
day's work at the office. And many people will agree that spending a little
more than usual on ingredients is well warranted when you want a good meal -
fast.
To major on such ingredients as scallops, steak, duck breast or calves'
liver could strike you as extravagant - but is it? In practice, home-cooked
dishes using these are likely to cost no more than mediocre meals from
high-street multiples.
If, on the other hand, you cook a quick recipe based on such ingredients as
chicken livers, herring roes, mackerel or pasta, you can enjoy a high-speed
meal at bargain basement prices - just right when Budget day looms.
SALMON UNDER A CRUST (serves 2)
A green vegetable such as broccoli, lightly-steamed spinach or French beans,
goes well with salmon cooked this way.
Ingredients: 1 tail fillet of salmon weighing 8-9 oz; 1 1/2 oz fresh bread
crumbs; 1 small shallot; the finely-grated zest of half a lemon; 1
tablespoon each chopped chives and parsley; 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped
tarragon; extra virgin olive oil; freshly-squeezed lemon juice.
Method: Chop the shallot finely and soften it in 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
Away from the heat, add 2 teaspoons lemon juice, then stir in the crumbs,
lemon zest, herbs, some salt and pepper.
Skin the salmon and brush it all over with a scant teaspoon each of olive
oil and lemon juice mixed together. Lay the fish, skinned side up, on a grid
laid across the gratin dish in which you will serve it, and grill for about
4 minutes under moderate heat.
Turn the salmon, then sprinkle and press the savoury breadcrumbs lightly
over it. Never mind if some of the crumbs fall off the fish into the dish;
they won't be wasted. Slip the dish back under the grill and cook for 3-4
minutes more until the salmon is just cooked through, but still moist and
tender, under a crust.
MUSTARD MACKEREL (serves 2)
This is an even more effortless recipe. It comes from Nigel Slater's Real
Fast Food, about which I enthused in my Christmas round-up of cookbooks and
which has been shortlisted for the Andre Simon award.
Ingredients: 4 mackerel fillets (2 mackerel); 2 tablespoons whole-grain
mustard; 1 tablespoon olive oil; the juice of half a lemon.
Method: Oil a shallow ovenproof pan lightly. Mix the mustard with the lemon
juice and olive oil and spread it over the mackerel fillets. Lay the
fillets, skin side down, in the pan and cook them in an oven heated to
425'F/220'C (gas mark 7) until tender enough to cut with a fork: say, 8-10
minutes.
Lift the sizzling fish out of the pan and serve with a watercress and blood
orange salad and good wholemeal bread.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Capital eats in Paris - Nicholas Lander
enjoys three memorable meals in a day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not easy to recommend restaurants in Paris as everyone seems to have a
favourite. But, with the pound at such a low exchange rate against the
franc, here are three distinctive restaurants that may make any trip to that
delightful city no less expensive but more memorable:
Breakfast. Cafe Le Flore, 172, Boulevard St-Germain.
Opposite Brassserie Lipp and next to Les Deux Magots, an other famous
Parisian cafe, Le Flore has been second home to many famous literary
figures, Huysmans, Sartre and de Beauvoir.
Its croissants and pains au chocolat are excellent; the coffee and hot
chocolate are strong and dark and the red banquettes offer comfort and
discretion. The waiters are suitably discreet, too. I sat and felt much
aggrieved as, on the next table, a middle-aged man introduced his much
younger fiancee to the waiter, also a Nicholas, rather than to me.
Any table near the entrance of the cafe's small kitchen offers the chance to
overhear the waiters' barked orders - 'un cafe, deux espress' and, even at
9am, 'deux bieres' - because the waiters, as in so many cafes, do not bother
with order pads.
Lunch. Chez Georges, 1 Rue du Mail, tel 42 60 07 11.
A restaurant that offers the definitively bourgeois cooking of the Lyonnais
area. It is near Place des Victoires in the 2nd arrondissement.
You should lunch there for those very French dishes - rillettes of pork,
fromage de tete, coq au vin or blanquette de veaux - and, also, for those
unforgettable French restaurant sights such as a table occupied by one
woman, wrapped in a fur coat with a poodle at her feet, happily moving
through a large, bloody steak, a bottle of red wine and a packet of
cigarettes.
Chez Georges, too, for a unique style of service. Le patron, dressed in a
chef's jacket, greets you although he handles nothing more than than a
credit card processing machine which sounds the only discordant note in a
busy room where the decor does not seem to have changed for 50 years. He
then hands you over to one of half a dozen waitresses who are comforting,
swift on their feet and in control. As I walked past the entrance to the
kitchen I overheard one waitress telling the chef, firmly, that when she
cooked kidneys at home, she cooked them in quite a different manner.
Fish included an escalope of salmon with sorrel, fillet of turbot with
chanterelles mushrooms and noodles and sea bass with a beurre blanc. The
house speciality was profiteroles filled with ice cream and a hot chocolate
sauce. Cheeses are excellent. Across the road is one of Paris's oldest, and
most picturesque, patisseries, Au Panetier. Cost is Pounds 25-Pounds 30 per
head as long as you stick to their good cru Beaujolais served in pitchers.
Dinner. L'Ami Louis, 32 Rue de Vertbois, tel 48 87 77 48.
This restaurant which, in its 60 years, has been owned by the original
Louis, then Antoine and now by a younger Louis, manages to do things I have
seen nowhere else in the world.
Your coats are taken and thrown on to a shelf that runs down both sides of
the dining room (the gap between the two lines of tables is exactly the
width of Louis's shoulders) the descent to the lavatories in the basement
the steepest I have ever navigated (do not let go of the rope handle) on the
dining tables napkins almost the size of tablecloths are provided and French
bread, sliced horizontally and grilled is borne to your table as a six-inch
tall edifice, only outdone by the frites which arrive, in the shape of a
bee-hive.
All the cooking is done on an ancient, wood fired range. When I was
introduced to the chef as a former restaurateur the only question he asked
was whether my stoves were wood-fired. He walked off in disgust when I told
him they were gas. There is no concession whatsoever to vegetarians. The
only accompaniments to the massive plates of food are a simple green salad
and watercress for a garnish.
L'Ami Louis is run on three principles. Firstly, it buys only the best
ingredients irrespective of cost. Then it cooks them simply and serves them
with unflinching generosity. My roast chicken, cooked with as much butter as
chicken, was moist and delicious. Snails and slabs of foie gras were large,
and the potato cake that arrived smothered in garlic underneath the confit
of duck was unforgettable, particularly as I had to steal it, morsel by
morsel, from my friend's plate.
Louis's customers respond to this generosity by ordering magnums of red from
a newly-improved wine list. Dinner costs approximately Pounds 60 per head.

Lane Fox is already marshalling his killer forces against them

AMONG THE marvellous haze of blossom on the first prunus trees, it would be
easy to sit back during this weekend, head for the suburbs and enjoy the
sudden beauty of Britain's streets. Even in the garden there is continuing
confusion: hellebores are flowering with forsythias, primroses have been out
for ages, and pulmonarias are behaving as if the Budget did not threaten.
Before setting out my plan of action, I must put in a word for a deep blue
pulmonaria called Highdown Blue. Special forms of pulmonaria seem to
multiply yearly, but this one has a vigour and depth of colour which
outclasses the many others I have tried.
Highdown Blue flowers madly at a height of about nine inches, but the colour
is so deep that it stands out at a distance in small groups, dotted at
intervals in the front of a border which is otherwise out of season. The
flowers wilt as soon as you pick them, but revive smartly if put in hot
water. This plant seems quite indestructible, even after somebody squashed
it by parking a car on top of it out of season.
Highdown Blue is my plant of the week, but it is certainly not my weekend
problem. Here, the answer is brutally simple: get a move on. Every year,
most of us attack our weeds and diseases too late. My armoury is already on
red alert, a task force with four props until somebody tells me of a fifth
which is even better.
In mid-March, you are most unlikely to be thinking about leaves on your
roses, let alone about black spot, the disease which strips them in so many
gardens from July onwards. Black spot was awful last year but, if you want
to control it this year, you must act at once. Indeed, in another 10 days or
so, you will be too late.
The weaponry here is a systemic fungicide which works through stems and
leaves and acts as a prevention rather than a cure. It needs to be in place
before the disease takes hold. The best chemical to buy is Nimrod T, sold by
ICI at about Pounds 5 for enough of a dose to cope with a large rose border
throughout the season.
The instructions suggest that you spray in May and never go away afterwards,
but experts prefer to begin much sooner and be more relaxed later in the
year. Already, young shoots on roses are wonderfully far ahead and so you
can strike the first defensive blow, making a serious impression.
Nimrod T is sprayed all over the plant. You will need to follow up at least
once a month but, insofar as anything combats this hideous disease, this
compound is the best answer. While you are out, you also spray the
hollyhocks, as Nimrod T is effective against the rust which acts like black
spot on a rose and strips off their leaves in August.
Among moulds, not spots, the mild and wet winter has been very welcome. I am
finding that there has been considerable carnage through the lower levels of
my planting, especially among pinks and anything with silvery tendencies.
Wet seasons are wonders for mildew and, once again, it pays to start very
early.
On anything prone to mildew - violas and most forms of clematis - I prefer
to use Benlate. After spraying clematis with this brand name, you have also
protected against the dreaded wilt. You can then start to feed, a process
which enthusiasts began on clematis as early as February. As an easy food
with a relatively high value, I still stand by Phostrogen, which is diluted
and sprayed on to the leaves.
Weapon number three is a familiar visitor to this column but familiarity
does not breed weeds, especially if you spray them with Roundup. Conditions
this week have been ideal for its use: calm, dry days have encouraged early
growth on grass and broad-leaved weeds, which are now sufficiently voracious
to take up a dose of their own death. For several days, we have been
spraying Roundup on to unwanted grass, dandelions, daisies, broad-leaved
weeds and that infernal little white-flowered bitter cress which is such a
space-invader during March and April.
The key element in Roundup is glyphosate and, previously, gardeners were
supposed to buy it under the name of Tumbleweed (which I always found to be
weaker and more erratic). Professionals, meanwhile, would go to a farm
chemical supplier, sign the poison book and use Roundup in bulk on large
areas.
Since last year, garden centres have been selling Roundup GC for gardeners'
approved use, a stronger weapon than the Tumbleweed of their past. Roundup
takes up to three weeks to show its effects, but it is harmless to gardens
because it kills only by contact with a leaf, not by lingering in the soil.
On my floral calendar, this month (as usual) is lined with mildly dotty
'Green Garden Tips.' In March, they suggest that we should all cover our
flowerbeds with polythene in order to encourage weeds to germinate so that
we can then spend April hoeing them off in bulk. I suggest that we all join
the 20th century and spray the really difficult weeds, which are not just
annual seeds and which 'Green Tips' somehow fails to discuss.
Roundup GC will knock out big patches of weeds and coarse grass if used now
during a dry, still period of the day. As yet, it will not knock out the
ever-sliming slug.
Slugs have had a dream winter during all the rain, and have already made an
hors d'oeuvres out of my dicentras and sandwiches out of the emergent
hostas. Fortunately, they are also very responsive to Growing Success, a
newish granular killer with aluminium sulphate.
The granules can be scattered or diluted, and I prefer to scatter them like
mouse-killer between plants. It is billed as a molluscicide, and I think
that the slippery beasts deserve it. It is not a bait but claims to kill by
'contact action,' and to be 'used by people who care about pets, birds,
hedgehogs and livestock.'
If you like pets, except slugs, you will love Growing Success. It is
spreading now through garden centres but, if you cannot track it, its makers
are at South Newton, Salisbury, Wiltshire; which is part of the Wessex Peat
Group. I now use it against slimers before anything else: the granules can
even be diluted and sprayed carefully among young seedlings, including salad
plants. So far, this final prong in my armoury seems to mount an effective
defence for several months at a time.
If you cannot face spraying, do try scattering, but also please take your
lesson from this early season. The flowers are early, the Highdown Blues and
all the primulas, but so are the pests, not to mention this summer's
diseases.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: A taste of the Pyrenees - The wines of
south-west France interest Edmund Penning-Rowsell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH of the Atlantic-side Pyrenees, inland from Biarritz and Bayonne and
within the big arc of the river Adour, is one of the most unspoiled parts of
France. A visit based on Pau, Aire-sur-Adour, St Jean Pied-de-Port and the
charming (if faded) small spa town of Salies-de-Bearn provides access to
some small wine districts that are re-establishing themselves after decades
of decline following the phylloxera ravages of the last century and the
subsequent economic difficulties.
Madiran and Jurancon have always managed to keep afloat and now have some
enterprising private growers, but the region is dominated by co-operatives -
without which few growers would have survived. All producers have a lively
vente directe trade.
The red wines are dominated by the tough, tannic Tannat grape but softened
by Cabernet Sauvignon and Franc, and the whites are made from a number of
local varieties, notably the Gros and Petit Manseng, the grape of Jurancon,
the Petit Courbu, the Arrufiac and the Baroque.
Tucked into the Pyrenees in the heart of the Basque country near the Spanish
border, the 170 hectares of mountainous vineyards is claimed to be the
smallest appellation controlee district in France. It is certainly among the
most attractive, with St Jean-Pied-de-Port the walled local capital. Mainly
red; most of the wines are made by the co-op in St Etienne de Baigory, but
the leading private firm is Brana in St Jean which makes a dry white too, as
well as distilling delicious Poire William from its own orchard. In
Irouleguy, Ilarria, a small grower, makes excellent Tannat wine.
Bearn-Bellocq. To the north of Irouleguy and centred on Salies-de-Bearn,
this small district is best known for an attractive rose, made two-thirds
white from Gros Manseng and another local grape, Raffiat de Moncade, which
has a slight sweetness on the palate. The main co-operative's red wine
brand, unsurprisingly in this region, is named Henri de Navarre.
Tursan. Thirty miles north of Pau and based on the small town of Geaune,
this is a VDQS rather than an AC district. The production is 50 per cent
white and 50 per cent red, 90 per cent of this is made by the co-op. The red
wine is Tannat blended with the two Cabernets, while the mainly Baroque
white is a fairly strong countryish but fresh wine. Michael Guerard,
proprietor of the famous spa restaurant and hotel in nearby
Eugenie-les-Bains and the inventor of cuisine minceur, is a distinguished
member of the co-op. He has his own 10 ha of white wine which is served in
the restaurant. The British agent is Corney &amp; Barrow, London, EC2.
Jurancon. The village is a suburb of Pau and the big co-op is in adjoining
Gan, but most of its 600 hectares are to the south and west. The often
spectacularly steep vineyards are on the first abrupt folds of the Pyrenees:
lovely country threaded by a web of lanes. Until the 16th century Jurancon
was red as well as white, but now is only white, made from the Gros Manseng
for the dry and the Petit for the moelleux which is the district's delicious
chief claim to fame. Sec was largely developed after the second world war,
when sweet wines went out of favour. Tanners of Shrewsbury list the
excellent Domaine Latrille's sec Ch Jolys '90 at Pounds 7.16 and the '89
moelleux at Pounds 7.19.
Madiran. Twenty-five miles north of Pau, this is the largest and most
distinguished AC red wine producer of the area, with nearly 1,300 ha and 50
owners who bottle and market their own wine. It is the centre of Tannat
country, accounting for 70 per cent of output, with the two Cabernets
forming the balance. Three co-ops make most of the 550,000 cases of AC wine
 -although even today only 10 per cent is matured in oak. By the standards
of the region there are several large estates. The biggest is Ch Montus and
Ch Bouscasse with a combined 60 ha, owned by the energetic Alain Brumont,
followed by the Laplace family property of Ch d'Aydie with 45 ha. The other
leading vineyards include Chapel Lenclos, Dom. Berthoumieu and
Lafitte-Peston. There are strong local efforts to improve quality and limit
grape yields, as well as united promotional efforts to improve the image of
this historically celebrated deep-coloured, bold, full-flavoured wine. A
small amount of dry white is produced under the somewhat hard-to-sell name
of Pacharenc du Vic Bilh, but it is welcome in the region's restaurants. In
the UK Madiran comes and goes on merchants' lists, but deserves more
exposure.
Saint-Mont. Much the largest district, covering a wide area in the
south-west of the Gers department, to the north of Madiran and the east of
Aire-sur-Adour. It only acquired VDQS status in 1981 and is dominated by a
union of three co-ops in Saint-Mont, Aignan and Plaisance that sell a large
proportion of the 11m bottle output under the name Playmont, with Collection
Playmont reserved for the better qualities. About 60 per cent of their
production is the popular Vin de Pays Cotes de Gascogne, and a quarter of
all Madiran is made at Saint-Mont. The top wine is the Tannat/Cabernet Ch de
Sabazon, adjoining the fine, turreted 15th century castle.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Enough to tempt a saint - A man of many
parts inspires Kieran Cooke's choice of food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE always had a soft spot for St Francis Xavier. He had a tough enough
life, wandering around the Far East long before the days of decent hotels.
And death did not bring peace; far from it. His fellow Portuguese decided
that Francis, being the great man he was, should be shared around.
There must be more parts of Francis spread around the world than any other
saint. A hand in Macau, a leg or foot in Goa. A substantial slice of him in
Lisbon. Various parts rumoured to be in Africa.
And so we move from saints to stomachs. The connection is simple. I was
climbing a hill above the town of Malacca, on Malaysia's west coast, getting
the juices flowing in preparation for a slap-up meal.
St Francis was buried in Malacca for a few months before being carted off
and cut up. There is a statue to him on the hill (one hand is missing).
Having paid my respects, the main business of the evening began.
Malacca is the home of nyonya food, one of the world's great, but
least-known, cuisines. Nyonya, basically, is a delicate blending of Chinese,
Malay and Indian. Lest anyone think this might be yet another example of
composite cuisine, along the lines of spaghetti and chips or souvlaki and
peas, it should be stressed that nyonya has been around for a considerable
time and has developed an identity very much its own.
At about the time in the mid-16th century that St Francis, still in one
piece, was doing his eastern rounds, Chinese immigrants were drifting south
into Malay waters. They settled in what later became the Straits
settlements: Penang, Malacca and Singapore.
Many inter-married with locals and, over the generations, local customs were
adopted. The women - the nyonyas - wore the Malay sarong. The men - called
babas - built houses mixing both Chinese and local architecture. Known
collectively in Malay as Peranakan, many became wealthy members of an
emerging merchant class. They developed their own Malay-based patois.
There are still plenty of Peranakan in Malacca today. Some of the
architecture still survives. But the food is the most enduring feature.
To call the recipes complicated is an understatement. A traditional nyonya
would take hours to prepare a meal. Like all great cooking, instinct and
approximation are far more important than rules on ingredients and detailed
measurements. In Malay, this loose cooking style is called agar agar -
equivalent to 'a pinch of this and a splash of that.'
There are leaves and nuts from Indonesia. Spices - plenty of them - from
Malaysia, India and Thailand. Dried fungus, called Cloud's Ears, from China.
Yellow rice with hard-boiled eggs dyed red. Coconut and tamarind. Shrimp
paste and blimbing (a small, sour fruit). All these, together with fish,
chicken, beef or other dishes, are mixed to make a lip-smacking meal.
A nyonya feast might start with otak-otak. In Malay this means brains but it
is, in fact, fish cake mixed with coconut and spices, cooked and served in
special herbal leaves. Then you could move on to such dishes as nyonya
laksa, (noodles with prawn paste featuring liberal helpings of chillies and
other spices, dried fruits, lime and pineapple); beef rendang (dried beef
with a sauce capable of ringing alarm bells down at the fire depot); and
perhaps a nyonya-style fish-head curry.
On no account should one sidestep the pudding. The Peranakan are hearty
believers in their kueh - small cakes and jellies, usually either stuffed or
covered in coconut, sometimes both. For something truly local, gulam Malacca
should not be missed: sago pudding cooked in brown sugar and coconut milk.
The meal is best washed down with liberal amounts of tea. A cooling beer is
excellent to have afterwards, relaxing in a cane armchair under a fan. Wine,
up against all those far stronger tastes, is a waste of money.
There are those who might want to rush out and try a bit of nyonya agar agar
for themselves. My advice would be to save up and go to Malacca instead. Two
excellent restaurants are ready and waiting. One, the Peranakan House in
Cheng Lock street, is in a traditional Peranakan house. Such is the noise
level in many restaurants in the East, conversation can be very limited. But
here there is peace and quiet - and great food.
The other restaurant, a sister to the one in town, is in an old Chinese
mansion at Klebang Besar, about five miles out on the coast.
I assume that Francis is up there, tasting the succulent fruits of heaven.
But it is a pity he could not have stayed together longer - in body and
soul. Even a saint might be tempted by nyonya food.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Not rich, but on top of his world
 -Clive Fewins meets a happy band of thatchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THATCHING IS catching, according to mathematics graduate Martin 'Barney'
Bardsley, who is confident that, barring ill health or acts of God, he will
stay in the profession he switched to 16 years ago at the age of 27 for the
rest of his working life.
'I have no regrets. My father, who started as a manual worker and finished
life as a teacher, thought I was crazy leaving a secure job in the civil
service, but I enjoy the work I do, even high up on roofs in the depths of
winter.'
Money is a different matter. There may be thatchers who drive BMWs and own
farms on which they grow their own materials, but Barney Bardsley is not one
of them. In spite of a working week that extends to six days and often
breaks into a seventh Bardsley, 43, expects to earn well under Pounds 20,000
before tax this year. The same goes for his partner David Brown, 37.
The two have shared all the profits since they merged their businesses to
form Bardsley and Brown three years ago, and it has worked.
'Thatching can be a solitary life and both of us still wonder why we did not
team up years before. David has always thatched - unlike me he comes from a
thatching family - but he agrees that shared expertise and risk taking is a
good idea, provided you trust one another.'
That view has proved particularly true in the last precarious year. Bardsley
and Brown have seen their order book shrink from one to two years in advance
to six months. The recession has had a lot to do with it. But there is
another reason: the number of thatchers has grown, not decreased, in recent
years.
'Nowadays it is possible to go on a six month course, buy a thatching
franchise and set up in business immediately after, and this is what a
number of people have done after collecting their redundancy money,'
Bardsley said. 'The result is that there are too many thatchers chasing too
little work. Some thatchers - some of them very good - face going out of
business.'
Bardsley is slow to condemn the new thatching companies - he says there are
some good ones - and he stresses the importance of younger people learning
the craft. But he dislikes the idea of teams of thatchers, often employed by
the larger companies. He feels this approach takes away much of the craft
element of the work, and the interest of the individual thatcher in his
work. It is this he enjoys most.
'This year it has been tough. David and I will only get near the Pounds
20,000 each we aim at if we manage to turn over Pounds 80,000, as we did in
1990, but with the bad harvest last year and consequent higher price of
straw, the wet autumn, rising insurance costs and increasing competition I
doubt if we shall achieve this.
'We could make more money if we dropped our standards, but this is something
neither of us are prepared to do. To us job satisfaction is all-important.
By now I would probably be earning far more if I had continued as a
statistician at the Transport and Road Research laboratory. But I can't help
being a romantic. I love thatching and the satisfaction it brings desite the
harsh winter conditions and the current insecurity.
'It is hard to describe all the satisfactions, but every roof presents a
separate challenge. It is hard to describe the feeling you get when driving
past a well thatched roof that you have done many years later and thinking
'I did that'.'
'On big roofs the work can be repetitive. But that only lasts until you hit
an interesting spot and with the two of us plus our apprentice, who is soon
to qualify, we are able to switch jobs to make it interesting for all three
of us.'
Thatching has traditionally been carried out by small firms, and even today
there are thatching families in which the line can be traced back for many
generations. However, while running a larger business with several teams has
been shown to be the way to make money, the Bardsley and Brown way is not
currently very profitable.
'Pricing jobs is very difficult, particularly when you know you are probably
competing with someone who is likely to come in beneath you with a stupid
price,' Bardsley said.
'Balancing up the jobs on which you make a good profit against those that
turn out barely profitable is very difficult. We price jobs by the square, a
square being 100 sq. ft, for which the price is Pounds 600. For ridges - the
trickiest part of the job - we charge so much per foot, depending on the
style of ridge.
'Then there are the materials. In our area, south Oxfordshire, Berkshire and
north Hampshire, we nearly always use combed wheat reed. This is the straw
left after harvesting long stemmed wheat.
'Generally we buy it from a dealer based in Somerset, for Pounds 485 a ton.
Buying this way guarantees the quality. But even then every load of material
has different characteristics. Even bundles in the same load can vary. The
skilled thatcher will be able to get the best out of the varying
characteristics.'
Bardsley and Brown will not guarantee the lifespan of their roofs. Bardsley
has seen roofs of water reed - the most durable thatching material - last 70
years and a good wheat reed roof should last 25 years before it needs a
fresh top-coat. However, nearby trees, moss or bad air circulation can
greatly reduce this figure.
'Thatching still comes back to skill and experience,' Bardsley said. 'If you
have a thatched property you have get to know and trust your thatcher, and a
good thatcher will respect that. Some firms - I call them factory thatchers
 -just go in and out fast and make the job last only seven or eight years.
They get away with it, and they often make a lot of money.
'I couldn't sleep at night if I worked that way. But the sad thing is that
village communities are changing rapidly and virtually no thatch-owners know
anything about the subject. They fall hook, line and sinker for a gleaming,
newly-thatched roof, whatever the standard of workmanship. Sadly, only a
skilled thatcher can immediately distinguish between the good jobs and the
atrocious ones.'

FT  13 MAR 93 / As They Say In Europe: Britain's overheated news economy -
Press Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND anniversary of the day this column was launched on an astounded
world seems a good time to reflect on the unique nature of the British
media. It stems from the intense competition among 11 national dailies and
the way that is heightened by the power of a well-funded nationwide
broadcasting system. In the rest of Europe the news market is dominated by a
couple of weekly magazines, one or two national papers and any number of
regionals which operate on a shoestring and poverty-stricken broadcasters.
That the British media exercise a uniquely decisive influence on national
political life has been notably demonstrated in recent days: in no other
country would what has been termed the 'moral panic' over juvenile crime
have provided the basis of such a concerted campaign that led to almost
instant action on the part of the government.
Foreign correspondents in London quickly become attuned to the
'nine-day-wonder' nature of the news. It results from the way national
dailies, and not only the tabloids, latch on to a single phenomenon to fight
competitive battles. Veterans of the foreign press corps who have been
scarred by numerous incomprehensible stories - Westland, salmonella in eggs
 -now take a sardonic view of those sudden eruptions that characterise the
flow of British public life.
But their daily rhythm is rigid. The Today programme on Radio 4 is part of
breakfast. They can relax until the World at One appears on the same
wavelength. These set the agenda which is pursued in Question Time in
Parliament and that in turn assures the headlines for the evening TV news
and next day's papers.
Thus the British debate runs like this: The Guardian carries an exclusive
about a secret report on the decline of the ice cream industry. The Today
programme gets hold of the story and runs a feature on the rise of American
ice cream in Britain. The original report is published in full later that
morning and the World at One interviews the Minister for Ice Cream. In
parliament during Prime Minister's questions, John Major rejects demands for
action. Next day the Daily Express leads on the headline, 'Ice cream: Major
acts.'
Look what happened to the last set of unemployment figures. Endless items up
to 'U-day' itself predicted that unemployment would rise above 3m. Then came
the figures. They showed that it stood at 2,995,100 seasonally adjusted. So
the media unanimously, and contrary to normal practice, seized on the
unadjusted figures which put unemployment at above 3m. How wise the Germans
are never to say when their official statistics are to appear.
One may wonder if the institutionalised overheating of the policy debate in
Britain damages the policy-making process. City economists, who should be
safely locked up feeding incorrect forecasts to their employers, become
famous, quoted and interviewed on all aspects of government policy. When the
pound was on its way out of the ERM last September, they appeared across the
media to sing the praises of devaluation. Now guess whether their employers
made or lost money on the sudden collapse of sterling.
The situation in France or Germany is quite different. For one thing, both
suffer a dreadful shortage of economists. There is some discussion of public
policy issues on the broadcast media but the usual fare of morning current
affairs programmes is provided by the clients of resourceful public
relations agencies. 'And now we take a look at the forthcoming masterpiece
of Jean-Luc Cineaste.'
It was inevitable that there was an intense debate in Britain on the
Maastricht Treaty while public opinion in most of the rest of Europe
supinely accepted the word of parti pris Eurocrats. But have the benefits of
this public debate outweighed the damage? Is the absurd chain of events at
Westminster not the result of an over-excited controversy that is constantly
fanned into life by highly-motivated and gifted newsmongers?
And they in turn are assisted by an astonishing number of well-organised
pressure groups, charities and of course MP's devoted to ensuring the public
benefits from their unique insights. All these have abundant access to the
nation's news outlets to which decision-makers feel compelled to pay
attention. Any time anybody wants an opinion in Britain there is always the
Royal Society for the Protection of This and That, Credit Russe Bigbang &amp;
Boom, the Sweatshop Association, Help the Rich, Women Against Men, the
National Truss and Hernia Foundation and Lord knows who ready to provide it.
And everybody who is anybody from Land's End to John O'Groats has to listen.
It could all get worse. There may yet be a Freedom of Information Act.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Sport: War of the puppets - The new F1 season starts
tomorrow / John Griffiths looks at the backstage battle over technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIANAPOLIS-bound Nigel Mansell was closer to the mark than perhaps even he
knew when, with his waspish parting shot at his detested rival Alain Prost,
he said that the Williams-Renault in which Prost will start the South
African grand prix tomorrow was so advanced it could be driven by 'a
puppet.'
Indeed, grand prix technology is hurtling forward so fast that, left
unchecked, a puppet might not be necessary. Max Mosley, the president of the
Federation Internationale du Sport Automobile (Fisa), the world governing
body of motor sport, says: 'We are talking about something which technically
could be only three or four years away.'
The cars, digital 'maps' of each circuit stored in their computer memories
and with an occasional adjustment from the pits via telemetry, could be
capable of racing on their own with steering, suspension and brakes
responding by computer to electronic 'vision.' At the moment, they lack only
the vision system - and even that technology exists.
Human interest? Slap a helmet and overalls on anyone prepared to go along
for the ride.
He or she would lack the skills of world champions Mansell, Prost or Ayrton
Senna - but would not need them. Nor, from the perspective of sponsors,
increasingly uneasy at the spiralling costs of grand prix racing, would they
warrant the Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m) which the top drivers received in the
1992 season.
Of all the team changes, personal rivalries, cash crises and other dramas
which have combined to make the 1993 season one of the most important in
grand prix history, the technology issue stands out. The grand prix world,
familiar with the problems of driving round a circuit, has found itself at a
crossroads.
Along one route lies Indycar racing - equivalent to grand prix in north
America - with which Mansell is grappling. Here, electronic control systems
are banned, gearboxes are manual and engines have to be shared among teams.
The emphasis is on equalising machinery to maximise competition between
drivers.
Down the other lies unchecked technology, ever-climbing expense and the
diminution of the role of the driver.
The recession has cut sponsorship budgets - one well-informed source
suggests a fall of 50 per cent this season - just as teams must find the
cash to keep up with the rapid technological developments. Manufacturers,
sponsors, administrators, engineers and drivers are asking, as never before,
whether grand prix should be sport or science.
Mosley, a barrister and a former racing driver, is staking his presidency on
curbing technology. On that basis, events in Paris on Thursday will be of
more fundamental importance than whether young Damon Hill beats veteran
team-mate Prost in the Williams-Renault at Kyalami tomorrow; or whether the
late-signing Ayrton Senna will upset the applecart with a suddenly more
competitive McLaren-Cosworth.
On Thursday, the FISA world council is expected to endorse the proposals of
its Formula One commission to ban, from the 1994 season, all electronic aids
which detract from the role of the driver. That includes the
computer-controlled 'active' suspension systems developed by leading teams
at a cost of millions; traction control, which stops skids automatically;
and possibly even the semi-automatic gearboxes which are one of the
dwindling areas of grand prix technology of likely relevance to future road
cars.
Some leading teams have grudgingly accepted tentative costing-cutting as
well as those measures aimed at helping less well-heeled teams, so
increasing the closeness of the racing this season. Even so, Mosley could
face a revolt.
There have been muttered threats of legal action against the technology ban,
on the ground that it has not won the approval of all teams. Mosley says he
will stick to his guns.
The prospect of a technology ban is viewed differently in F1's various
camps. For leading technology-driven constructors such as Williams, McLaren
and Benetton, yielding expensively-won advantage is a bitter pill to
swallow.
The attitude of the big manufacturers who back grand prix is conditioned by
performance. Renault, Ford and Mercedes (powering the new Sauber team)
oppose the ban. Ferrari, struggling woefully to get to grips with the
technology, would be quietly grateful.
Drivers, Prost prominent among them, are mostly in favour for it is their
skills which are devalued by technology.
Sponsors with no entrenched motor industry interests other than the simple
desire to stay exposed to a 100m global grand prix television audience,
maintain a discreet silence but welcome quietly the prospect of closer
racing at less cost.
Most important of all, the ban would mean that Indy and grand prix cars
could move relatively quickly towards a common specification.
Already, planning permission for been given for one Indy-style oval on a
disused British Steel site at Corby in Northamptonshire while Silverstone's
owner, the British Racing Drivers' Club, has completed detailed planning for
a second. A third is being prepared by Donington Park's owner, Tom
Wheatcroft.
US motor racing officials, who show distaste for the intense politics and
perceived gravy train of Formula One, pour cold water on the idea of a
F1-Indy 'marriage.' But Mansell's presence on this year's Indy circuit, and
sponsor pressure, could see the shotgun brought out.
A technology ban would be of almost wholly unalloyed benefit. Grand prix has
had its moments, Mansell's gloriously futile chase of Ayrton Senna at Monaco
last year among them. But the very fact that grand prix overtaking
manoeuvres are memorable as much for their rarity as their spectacle
underlines Mosley's concern about the grand prix processional.
Last month, Dale Earnhardt took a hard-earned victory in one of the most
famous US races, the Daytona 500. During the contest, the lead changed 38
times.
That is motor racing.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Sport: After Mansell - The new F1 season starts tomorrow /
Martin Jacques asks which driver will win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first grand prix of the Formula One season at Kyalami, South Africa,
tomorrow will provide some light relief from the politics that have
dominated the closed season. As the racing starts, F1 is afflicted by doubt
and uncertainty.
During the 1980s, F1 was in expansive mood. Attendances at races mushroomed,
television audiences grew apace, sponsorship brought unprecedented resources
to the teams, and the big car-makers entered the fray on a greater scale
than ever before. F1 enjoyed its own version of the boom years. Last season,
however, the recession began to bite. Three teams withdrew, and rumours in
the paddock suggested that all but the top ones were feeling the pinch.
The downturn coincided with a more existential crisis. The season proved to
be one of the most processional ever. Nigel Mansell in his Williams-Renault
dominated from beginning to end. He won more grands prix in the course of
the season than anyone had ever achieved previously.
Crowds dropped and, most seriously of all, so did television audiences. The
powers-that-be began to worry that the television companies might lower F1's
credit rating, with potentially dire consequences for the financial health
of the sport.
The secret of Mansell's domination was the remarkable technical advantage
achieved by Patrick Head and Adrian Newey, the Williams designers, over
their rivals. But this proved expensive and F1 was threatened by a pincer
movement: poor entertainment value and escalating costs.
To compound matters, negotiations between Williams and Mansell over a new
contract broke down and F1 finds itself facing the new season without the
world champion and, by common consent, the most exciting driver.
Worse, Mansell signed for one of the top teams in the US Indycar series, a
long-standing rival of F1 and the main reason why it has never become a
serious force in north America. Mansell's charisma saw European television
companies, including Britain's ITV, queuing to buy the rights to broadcast
the Indycar events.
But as the 1993 season prepares for the lights to turn green, there are some
encouraging signs on the track. The fear has been that there would be a
repeat of last year, with Williams - and Alain Prost, in particular -
disappearing into the blue yonder.
Pre-season predictions are, however, always notoriously difficult and
unreliable. They are based on close-season testing involving many different
circuits and conditions and, often, wilful attempts by one team or another
to conceal their true performance.
Last season, the majority of pundits failed to predict Mansell's
extraordinary domination: instead, most of them backed Ayrton Senna to
become world champion again. This season, needless to say, they have gone
overwhelmingly for Prost in the Williams.
In recent testing, though, the Benetton - fitted with all the latest
technology and driven by Michael Schumacher, the talented young German - has
gone well. So, too, has the new McLaren which, in the hands of Senna,
managed to break the lap record at Silverstone last week.
The McLaren's performance persuaded the three-time world champion to race in
South Africa: previously, he had left his intentions for the new season
suitably vague, even considering giving it a miss altogether should the new
McLaren not be competitive.
Meanwhile, many eyes will be cast westward as Mansell wends his round the US
(and, occasionally, Canada and Australia) in his Indycar. The F1 authorities
will no doubt be monitoring his progress with more than a little
nervousness: motor racing fans, however, are promised a double whammy. For
most of the season, F1 and Indycar will be on UK television screens on
alternate Sundays.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Sport: Off-piste with the fat boys - Skiing / Arnold Wilson
tries helicopter skiing in the deserted wilderness of Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT COULD almost be a Vietnam war film clip with snow. Every morning at 8.30,
five helicopters with headlights blazing come clattering into Blue River.
Without fail the adrenalin starts pumping.
Helicopter skiing is addictive and these days anyone with sufficient money
can do it. Forget virtuoso technique. Forget leaping off cliffs. Thanks to a
newoff-piste ski, the Atomic Powder Plus - nicknamed 'fat boys' or 'fat
sticks' - money, or lack of it, is the only barrier to those who dream of
heli-skiing.
Mike Weigele certainly has a lot of wealthy customers at his Blue River
resort in the mountain wilderness of British Columbia. One pony-tailed
client, who skis there eight weeks a year and takes lobster up to the lodge
for his private party, is worth Dollars 50m (Pounds 35.2m).
The Powder Plus skis, developed by Atomic, are being copied by other
manufacturers. The wide-bodied ski is revolutionising off-piste skiing, in
all types of conditions. The big heli-skiing companies in Canada - Canadian
Mountain Holidays and Weigele - have switched to them.
It is a little like having a mono-ski or even a water-ski on each foot. In a
sense, the skis enable you to cheat. They can make skiing off-piste so easy
that any reasonable intermediate can do it.
All week, while Blue River remained lost in fog, we rose above the clouds in
our Bell 212 to enjoy a feast of skiing with our new rental Powder Plus
skis.
Safety is paramount in helicopter skiing. The first evening and following
morning were taken up with safety drill. 'There are three Number One rules
of heli-skiing,' says our amiable guide, Bob Sayer.
'The most important is: 'don't break the helicopter'.' Guests have been
known to accidentally snap off the long proboscis that provides the
helicopter with radio communications with the guide and other pilots.
Next comes: 'Never ski past the guide.' Crevasses, avalanche slopes or both
could be lurking ahead.
The third rule is more positive: 'Don't forget we are here to have fun. We
do not need to move fast around the helicopter. Just be careful and we'll
all stay happy and have fun.'
There are other rules. 'Don't ski too close together,' says Sayer. 'We're
almost alone in more than 4,000 square miles of mountain wilderness, so
what's the point of skiing into each other?
'Keep an eye on the helicopter at all times when it is coming in to land or
taking off. And when you jump out of the helicopter, don't bury your head in
the snow.'
Soon we were skiing our first run, Cedar, an easy warm-up. *something in
here (HP) *
Then we skied a longer, more difficult run called Mousetrap before turning
our attention to Paradise, the first with real glacier terrain. Our guide
prefaced every run with instructions varying from: 'Ski in my tracks' if
there was a danger of crevasses, to 'you can ski five turns apart, either
side of my tracks' if the coast was clear.
The best snow conditions of the week were in feather-light surface
hoar-frost - formed when moisture evaporates from the snow and freezes  - on
a run off Augerhorn. The skis performed brilliantly, flattering our turns
and enabling us to leave almost effortless 'S' tracks in gunbarrel gullies,
couloirs and all kinds of snowfields as we swooped down one roller-coaster
run after another.
The 'fat boys' were pioneered by Georg Ehrschwender, a former train driver
from Salzburg, who was with us that week. He is a brilliant skier, and his
inventions include goggles with a chimney arrangement which allows hot air
to rise and thus prevents them steaming up; powder poles with bright orange
trumpet-shaped baskets; a metallic hat that snow simply slides off; and a
silver-foil loo for women caught short while heli-skiing - which he
thoughtfully set up for us during lunch on a frozen lake at the bottom of a
run called, appropriately, Nancy's Relief.
When Georg discovered that his fibre-glass prototypes worked, he burst into
tears - but he cried only half-way to the bank. So far, he says, the skis
have not made him rich.
As the week progressed, we switched between the Monashees and the more
rugged and adventurous Cariboo slopes, depending on snow conditions and
visibility.
Our pilot, Greg Kennedy, was always there at the bottom, waiting to clatter
off to yet another run. An Everest a day - almost 30,000 vertical feet - is
not uncommon, especially on 'fat boys.'
Weigele operates helicopters along a 4,000 square mile area of the Monashee
and Cariboo Mountains from his base at Blue River Lodge, a remote spot on
the shores of Lake Eleanor 370 miles from Vancouver. CMH, Weigele's rivals,
also operates in the area, but they are such big ranges that the nearest the
two operations get to each other is 20 miles.
'There's a ton of skiing out here,' says Sayer, over an excellent dinner in
the cosy chalet-style lodge. 'We have 300 named runs and another thousand we
haven't named yet.' Arnold Wilson was a guest at Mike Weigele Helicopter
Skiing Holidays (0101-403-762-5548), marketed in Britain through Ski Scott
Dunn (081-767-0202) and Fresh Tracks (081-335-3003). He travelled to
Kamloops, British Columbia, with Air Canada, 7-8 Conduit St, London W1R 9TG
(081-759 2636).
The two-and-a-half hour journey to Blue River was by a Mike Weigele
Greyhound bus. A seven-day package, excluding flights from Britain, varies
from CDollars 2,900 (Pounds 1,630) to CDollars 4,670 (Pounds 2,623) for
double occupancy accommodation in individual spruce-log chalets, some with
self-catering facilities.
The package includes 100,000 vertical feet of helicopter lift, with 80,000
vertical feet guaranteed. Extra skiing is charged at CDollars 14 per 1,000
vertical feet. Three-day packages start at CDollars 1,570 and five days at
CDollars 2,370.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Motoring: On the road with Little and Large - Stuart
Marshall tests a stately Mercedes and the cheeky Subaru Vivio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF SIR Edwin Landseer had seen them together, he would have dashed off
another version of Dignity and Impudence. As it was, my neighbour said I
really had gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. He was looking at the
two cars standing side by side in my drive; a massive Mercedes-Benz 500SE in
which I had just made a 1,200-mile (1,930 km) return trip to Geneva, and a
tiny Subaru Vivio.
Sublime is a good way to describe the kind of motoring the 500SE offers. Its
five-litre, 308-horsepower V8 had propelled its two tonnes on autoroutes, N
and D roads, over the Col de la Givrine and in Geneva's traffic without ever
flexing its muscles or raising its voice.
To my surprise, it returned 20.63 mpg (13.69 l/100km) on the autoroutes and
19.61 mpg (14.41 l/100 km) elsewhere, making 20.12 mpg (14.04 l/100km)
overall. For so majestic a car, driven fairly briskly, I thought this not at
all bad: a 3.2-litre 300SE did little better (21.48 mpg/13.15 l/100 km) on
an identical trip last year. But French unleaded petrol is FFr5.52 (around
71p) a litre, or Pounds 3.23 a gallon, making the fuel cost 16p a mile
(nearly 10p a kilometre).
You can see why large-engined cars are few and far between in France. And
why, with gazole two-thirds the price of unleaded petrol, well over 40 per
cent of all newly-registered French cars are diesels. Mercedes-Benz S-Class
salesmen must be like Rolls-Royce dealers, telling prospective customers who
enquire about miles a gallon that, if they have to ask that kind of
question, they cannot afford the car.
In town - even more so in a multi-storey car park - you are aware of the
S-Class's bulk; but on an autoroute, it reigns supreme. High gearing (nearly
30 mph/48kmh per 1,000 rpm in top), double-glazed side windows and minimal
tyre rumble make the interior quieter than club class in a 747.
From standstill, it takes off with similar vigour to a Bentley Turbo R - but
such foot-hard-down antics are discouraged the instant the driver sees the
fuel consumption indicator drop into low single figures.
It rides superbly and handles with an agility that belies its size. The
air-conditioned interior provides four people with lounging space, and a
fifth is not cramped. The doors and the lid of the vast boot are closed
silently by electric motors. All cars should have rear-view mirrors like the
500SE's. A single knob power-adjusts the interior and exterior mirrors,
folds the outside ones flat (ideal when parking on a ferry or in a narrow
street) and restores them to their original position.
The Pounds 61,800 asked for a 500SE is a lot of money but a 500SE is,
undeniably, a lot of motor car. But expensive, luxury-class saloons will not
be so important to Mercedes-Benz in future; it has announced plans to make
high-quality cars for all market segments.
People who reckon to travel first-class everywhere will still want large -
and large-engined - luxury cars. While they do, the S-Class has a secure
future. No volume-produced rival can match it at present for performance and
prestige. But no maker is keeping a closer watch on the formidably good
Toyota Lexus 450 than Mercedes-Benz.
From the sublime to the Subaru. Stepping out of the 500SE and into the Vivio
was a bit like dismounting from the heaviest of hunters and throwing a leg
over a Shetland pony.
The Pounds 6,999 Vivio is tiny: shorter than a Rover Metro, not much longer
than a Mini, narrower and higher than either of them. This makes it
ultra-handy in traffic and parkable almost anywhere; yet, four people can
fit inside without their heads touching the roof. Tailgate (and fuel filler)
open from inside and the boot holds a supermarket trolley full of groceries.
All controls, steering included, are very light. The 658 cc, four-cylinder
engine accelerates up to high revolutions with an electric motor's
smoothness but pulls so well that fourth, even fifth, gears are usable in
town.
Although the little wheels tend to magnify potholes and drain covers, the
ride is not in the least teeth-jarring. And with a top speed of 83 mph (134
kph), the Vivio driver need not fear motorway speed cameras.
Although I would not choose one for a long journey, it is more than just a
town car-cum-shopping basket. Let the eager little engine spin fast and the
Vivio holds its own well enough not to be an embarrassment on the open road.
Drive it gently and the fuel consumption will be around 50 mpg (5.65 l/100
km).
The only real snow I have seen outside mountain areas this winter was on the
A26 autoroute between Calais and the A1 interchange last week. So, I cannot
speak from personal experience of the Vivio's unique in-class feature of
four-wheel drive, selectable at the touch of a button in the gear lever
knob. But I know that its similarly-equipped, slightly bigger brother, the
Subaru Justy, copes most competently with snowy roads and muddy car parks
alike.
Many commuting businessmen burden themselves with large, load-carrying and
fuel-thirsty on/off-road 4 x 4s because, they say, they want to be sure of
getting to a country station in winter. They would be better off providing
the nanny with a Vivio instead of a Metro as a runabout. Then, they could
have a nice big estate as the company car - and commandeer the Vivio when
they need four- wheel drive on snowy mornings.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Records: Breakaway rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROD Stewart may be making plans to tour with The Faces again, and minds are
already boggling at the thought of John Cale and Lou Reed contemplating a
reformed Velvet Underground, yet the most interesting albums of the last
month have come from a newer generation of performers only too pleased to be
breaking away from the bands that first brought them fame. The urge to shake
off collective responsibilities and strike out on a solo career seems
stronger than ever, the shelf life of a successful band correspondingly
shorter.
Frank Black's eponymous debut album arrived at the same time as a press
release confirming the break-up of The Pixies, the band in which Black
(operating under the guise of his previous incarnation, Black Francis) was
the moving, vaguely sinister spirit. What ever the reasons for the band's
demise, it does not appear to have been a dispute over direction, for though
Black has recruited a new band (including one half of They Might Be Giants
and a former member of Captain Beefheart) the musical mix on Frank Black
(4AD CAD3004) is recognisably of a piece with the sounds and sources that
made The Pixies' four albums so distinctive and engaging.
The original concept was apparently to compile a collection of cover
versions, but only the Beach Boys homage has survived. All the rest is new
material from Black, in which he is able to give full rein to his pet
obsessions, especially extra-terrestrials and UFOs, as well as throwing in a
tribute to the Ramones and a brief nod towards John Denver. Just as often
though the verbal meaning is hard to divine, and then the songs fall back on
their exuberance to survive; the energy and the invention are unmistakable,
naggingly insistent.
Throwing Muses was the creation of Kristin Hersh and her half sister Tanya
Donnelly, but with Hersh's retreat into motherhood the band that threatened
to corner the market in opaque lyrics seems to gone terminally dormant. Left
to her own devices Donnelly has assembled her own band, named it Belly, and
after a couple of exploratory EPs last year now produced a first album, Star
(4AD CAD3002), which turns out to be a remarkably assured and insidiously
powerful collection.
Within musical packages that move easily between bright, clean pop and
acoustic-based country and take in all points between, Donnelly secretes
lyrics of undisguised bleakness, deploying her little-girl-lost voice with
unexpected resource and subtlety.
No such problems with Balinese Dancer (China WOLCD 1031), the second solo
album from Chuck Prophet, guitarist and a very good one too with the West
Coast band Green on Red. While there is no hint yet of that refreshingly
straightforward band going their separate ways, Prophet is clearly a
confident and accomplished solo performer in a style that is basically
country rock, even if the odd blues inflection is mixed in here and there.
His singing voice may be closest to Tom Petty, and he can manage a passable
Dylan whine, but the material stands up well in its own right, and is always
graced by Prophet's own elegant guitar playing.
For some of course, there's no need to lookback or hanker after a return to
former glories. There must now be a whole new generation of Sting fans who
have no idea who Police were or how their hero first achieved his present
eminence. And just as Sting's very genuine talent threatened to disappear
under the self-inflicted weight allusion and pretension he has produced a
new album, Ten Summoner's Tales (A &amp; M 540 075-2), which represents a
decisive return to his top form.
The references to Chaucer and to his own surname (Sumner) in the title can
be dismissed as untroubling conceits; the 12 songs here (ten 'tales',
together with prologue and epilogue) explore familiar Sting territory, even
though South America seems off limits this time. But there is a new
directness and simplicity in the songwriting and the arrangements; besides
which he is, whatever anyone says, a remarkably fine singer.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Making a meal of screen violence: Dr Lecter feels guilty.
Dominic Lawson says he need not worry, although his taste in wine is poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year Anthony Hopkins was knighted perhaps for services to screen
violence. In the Silence of the Lambs, Sir Anthony, as he then wasn't,
played the part of a cannibal, Doctor Hannibal Lecter, whose favourite meal
was human liver, washed down with Chianti. For this portrayal of gastronomic
perversion - Chianti, for heaven's sake, not even a decent claret - Hopkins
was also awarded an Oscar.
Now the great Welsh actor says that it might have been a terrible mistake to
have taken part in such a violent film. And the man who approved making Dr
Hannibal into Sir Hannibal, John Major, has told the Conservative Party
faithful in Harrogate that something must be done about 'the relentless diet
of violence in the media'.
Major's argument, assuming that as usual, he is following the conventional
wisdom, seems to be that the impressionable imitate the violence they see on
their screens. Being an impressionable fellow myself, I thought it safer not
to go to see The Silence of The Lambs. Otherwise I might even now be
imitating the main character, turning into a transvestite serial killer and
stuffing the larvae of rare moths down the throats of my victims.
Perhaps you too might be impressionable. Have you murdered anyone recently?
You must have seen hundreds of murders on television or in the cinema.
Surely some of it must have rubbed off on you. Or are you still the same law
abiding citizen with no sudden craving to eat human flesh washed down with
cheap Italian wine?
Television has become a convenient alibi, and not just for politicians
seeking to shift the blame for rising crime on to other shoulders.
The idea of television as responsible agent is also a convenient alibi for
those who most need it - criminals and their lawyers. You know the sort of
thing: 'My Lord, my client was a perfectly harmless football hooligan with
only a few minor offences - and then he saw Denis Potter's Lipstick on Your
Collar. After that he promptly and understandably raped his wife. I ask for
the Court's clemency.'
The point is that people who commit violent crime are not like you and me.
Their violence comes from within themselves, not down a television tube. In
fact, the more time such people spend watching television the safer the rest
of us are.
What is undeniable is that violence on television can be distressing to
watch, particularly for little children. Alan Yentob, the new controller of
BBC 1, said, in response to Major, that it was up to parents to protect
their children from violent television.
Parents should not need to defend their children from the BBC. Auntie should
not be like an unpredictable dog, a sort of electronic Rotweiler which needs
to be locked up and kept away from children and old ladies.
But Yentob is partly right: as adults we have a choice of what to watch and
what not to watch. If we grown-ups do not like violence on television, we
should vote with our fingers and switch off.
The new crusaders against what is usually termed 'gratuitous violence' argue
that we have lost the will to switch off, because we no longer have the
sensitivity to be shocked. They say we have become 'desensitised' to
violence, so that we can sit calmly grazing at our TV dinners while watching
scenes of horrific bloodshed.
This may be true, but if so, it is the images of bloodshed to which we have
become accustomed, not the reality. In common with many viewers of
television news I have become emotionally immune to scenes of harrowing
brutality. But recently when I witnessed someone being run over by a car, I
was shaken and shocked. That is why crowds immediately gather at such
scenes. They know that this is the real thing, not 'gratuitous' at all, and
something quite different in kind from the edited dramas of the television
screen.
Sir Anthony says that he will not do a sequel to Silence of the Lambs, so
disturbed is he by the effects of film violence. It is a fine stand. But Sir
Anthony should go ahead and keep his agent happy. The world will not be a
more dangerous place if Dr Lecter reappears in our cinemas. And who knows,
Sir Anthony might win another Oscar, and this time be rewarded with a
peerage.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Private View: Nature ramble with Marx's gardener
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GHOST of Karl Marx will be hovering over its tombstone in Highgate
Cemetery tonight, the eve of the great philosopher's death 110 years ago.
It was a quirk of history that the bones of the father of world communism
should come to rest not in the Kremlin wall but in a north London burial
ground laid out by financial speculators and managed by a group of
upper-middle-class English volunteer worthies.
Marx is buried in the later, east wing of the famous cemetery. Among his
comrades are Chubb the locksmith, Lobb the bootmaker, Foyle the bookseller,
Smith of Hovis, Cruft of the dog show and Hutch the cabaret star. More
congruously, there are Dr Dadoo, first chairman of the African National
Congress, and Claudia Jones, a black freedom fighter.
But Marx is old hat now, at least to the Friends of Highgate Cemetery who
bought the place 17 years ago: they measure his value by the pounds they
earn selling souvenir miniatures of the famous, bearded head. So it was not
to Marx's grave but through the heavy iron gates that protect the mysterious
and beautiful west wing - John Betjeman called it 'a Victorian Valhalla' -
that the chairman of the Friends and guardian of the tombstones, Jean
Pateman, conducted me last week.
Pateman is not the type to shiver at a memento mori nor be cowed by the
presence of the dead. She is one of those brisk, bossy women of ringing
accent and good family (the Ouseley-Smiths of Cheshire) who in England love
to sit on committees, raise money and run things.
She talked about the cemetery rather as if showing off her own, rather
overgrown, country-house garden ('don't walk on the vegetation if you don't
mind]') and with that English kind of pride which is full of superlatives
but from which all sentiment has been carefully scrubbed.
'You know,' she said, stopping to point out a stone angel weeping in the
undergrowth 'this is a team effort. I'm just the girl who's bullied and
stirred things along and promoted and driven and survived and . . . It's a
very big business now,' she added triumphantly.
Pateman is a mild name-dropper - it is part of her job, after all - and it
was occasionally hard to tell whether the names she dropped were of the
living or the dead. She discussed her famous supporters and tenants in the
same tone, as if discussing invitations to a dinner party. ('Christopher
Fry, our nicest, gentlest VIP, lovely man, absolutely charming . . . ').
How, I wondered, would Michael Faraday, the Sandemanian scientist, get on
with Joseph Frost, the Muggletonian, although both are buried in Dissenters'
Corner? William Jeakes, inventor of the hospital drying machine, would
certainly have something in common with that Dr Lee who decreed that
hospital windows could be opened. The Rossettis and Galsworthys would hit it
off. Tom Sayers, the prizefighter, could chat to George Wombwell, the
menagerie owner, about his pet dog Lion and Wombwell's pet lion Nero. I
should want to ask Sir James Tyler, of course. But do we dare put William
Lillywhite, the round-arm bowler, next to Radclyffe Hall, the lesbian author
 -especially if we have to invite her friend Mabel Veronica Batten as well?
Burial appears to be coming back into vogue. I asked Pateman why.
'I believe there is an extraordinary psychological need that many people now
feel to have something less austere and clinical and more in keeping with a
proper ritual,' she said.
Why do people choose to be buried rather than cremated?
She sniffed. 'Why do some people enjoy pancakes and others prefer fresh
fruit?'
Highgate contains 51,800 graves and the bones or ashes of 166,800 people.
The latest arrival, she told me, was 'a darling old boy of 94 who, for the
last 17 years or so, always kissed my hand whenever we met: he was a colonel
in the Polish air force.'
The cemetery's popularity has soared, from 12 burials a year when the
Friends took over to more than 80 a year. Space will have run out by the
millennium and prices - Pounds 540 for cremated remains, or 'cremains,'
Pounds 810 for a child's burial and between Pounds 2,200 and Pounds 6,850
for adults, according to the size of plot - will rise accordingly. You may
not book in advance.
The Friends describe Highgate as a nature reserve in a burial ground, and it
was plain that the living receive as much as attention as the dead. As we
climbed one of the paths, my guide listed the ground-covering plants: wild
garlic and Russian comfrey, periwinkle, lady's-mantle, wood-spurge and dusky
cranesbill, orange hawkweed, campion, Jacob's ladder and lung-wort.
Above us, a sycamore forest which had given way to ash woodland was being
cut to let in holly, yew and hawthorn, with plantings of lime, alder,
hornbeam, willow and aspen, and oak to attract the insects: 'About 286
different insects inhabit an oak, you know.'
It is a place, she said, for 'owl prowls and fungal forays' where
arachnologists, herpetologists and lepidopterists flourish. There are foxes
in the underbrush but the screaming peacocks disappeared some while ago -
strangled, probably, by the neighbours.
Its recent human visitors have included art students who came to draw the
monuments, mausoleums and catacombs, a party of funeral directors from
Belgium, restorers on their way to advise in Poland, landscape architects
from Italy, Norway and Finland, social historians and film researchers. The
Friends are squeamish about letting Highgate be used for horror films, but
many TV documentaries have exploited its photogenic atmosphere.
Conservation is a controversial business. Here, the policy is to patch up
rather than restore, Pateman explained as we circled the neo-Egyptian
necropolis that crowns the cemetery. It is the 'ruin-as-found' technique.
She began to elaborate, then broke off. 'That's Beatrix Potter's publisher
through there, by the way.'
When I mentioned the ivy draped in Gothic profusion over the monuments, it
seemed to touch a raw nerve. 'I'm not going to be drawn into the ivy
debate,' she said, firmly. 'There are three factors: it is a unifying
factor, it acts as a concealing agency, and it is a habitat for spiders. It
harbours the birds, of course . . .'
And it looks nice?
'Exactly. And it is only damaging to the softer stones.' Apart from anything
else, it would take armies of people to remove it all and it would look
perfectly horrifying.'
She indicated another grieving angel, gleaming white. 'The grave-owners came
and gave it a jolly good cleaning. Now, we can't say 'please don't clean'
though we can say 'don't bring any acid because it'll spoil the plants
nearby . . . But it does look a little incongruous. So does this . . .' She
pointed to an obelisk on the pathway, then checked herself and praised the
generosity of the shipping company P&amp;O which had restored the grave of
Broddie McGhie Wilcox, an early partner of the line.
Earlier, the chairman of the Friends had said she was too busy looking after
the living - there are 75,000 human visitors a year - to feel the presence
of the dead. 'But I'll tell you what I do feel. I feel afflicted by a great
sense of awe that wherever we move there is great and profound distinction -
the number of people who have made enormous strides in society.
'I mean, tucked away in there' (she pointed again) 'is the first person ever
to use an anaesthetic in this country - he was a dentist - several days
before the great operation at University College Hospital.'
Did he demonstrate on himself and pass away in the process? I asked,
facetiously. Pateman's eyebrows rose until they hit the band of her
home-made toque. She gave me an old-fashioned look: 'No comment'.
How would you like to end up, I asked her.
She laughed: 'I should like to become a tree, I think.'
Are you going to be buried?
'No, definitely not. Quite definitely not.'
Why not?
'Because - and this is highly personal - I really feel that cremation is
more hygienic and more appropriate and requires less space.'
Isn't that odd after you've spent so many years and so much energy tending a
graveyard?
'That's quite different,' she said. 'I was tipped in here because I happened
to be serving on the environment committee of the Highgate Society. I came
here very reluctantly.'
Eventually, she admitted that she would not object if her 'cremains' were
deposited at Highgate.
What inscription would you have on your tombstone?
''The old girl worked here', or something like that, I should think.' She
laughed.
Myself, I guess they will do better for her than that.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Out of the Getty, into the ghetto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM glad that Turner's Van Tromp Going About to Please His Masters is on
its way from London to the Getty Museum in Malibu at a price of Pounds 11m.
Britain is up to its ears in Turners. We should chuck a few more out. Other
stuff, too. We can hardly move in London for paintings, pots and rocks
Part of the reason for my equanimity is my admiration for the Getty Museum.
I was never a snob about it. I liked it at first sight. It opened in 1974.
Joan Didion called it 'rather giddily splendid . . . a commemoration of high
culture so immediately productive of crowds and jammed traffic that it can .
. . be approached by appointment only.'
It also seemed, she said, to stir up social discomforts at levels not easily
plumbed. The museum was thought to be vulgar. In 1986, at a lunch at the
Getty Trust in Santa Monica, I sat next to one of the Getty scholars, a
short-skirted professor of memorable loveliness who was happy to gossip. 'It
was kind of weird when it first opened,' she said. 'Here you were in this
supposedly Roman villa gazing into room after room of gorgeous French
furniture. It seemed the tackiest idea, but not any more. Now it's OK, even
studied and admired.'
I tried to visit the museum the other morning, but it was closed because of
a storm. Instead, I called at the Getty Trust to pick up its latest report,
which covers the period to June 1990. It shows how the Getty Trust, which is
run by clever people, is enlarging the kitty left by John Paul Getty.
This has set me thinking about the habits of the rich. It does not surprise
me that rich people collect art. It is often a form of aggression: a
parading of competitive wealth and taste. Conspicuous consumption.
What does surprise, now that I think about it, is the way in which the rich,
at death, entomb their pots and daubs in yet more museums instead of selling
them so as to endow charitable trusts whose specified mission was to help
combat the wretchedness in which the planet is plunged.
Take John Paul Getty. In 1982, after lengthy legal wrangling, the Getty
Trust received Dollars 1.2bn in assets from Getty's estate. The money grew
and grew. By March 1986, when I met the trust's president, Harold M.
Williams, the value of its endowment trust had reached Dollars 2.8bn. Today
it must be close to Dollars 4bn. The money is managed by experts. Its
minimum investment objective is a return of inflation-plus-5-per-cent. In
the years to June 1989 and June 1990, these investment returns were 14.3 and
11.6 per cent respectively.
Result: the Getty is sucking up tons of art and stashing it in California.
In the year to June 1990 the trust's total expenditure, including operating
outlays of Dollars 81m, was Dollars 250m, of which Dollars 140m was spent on
'developing its collections.' The trust is doing its job; doing what Getty
wanted.
'The mission of the J. Paul Getty Museum is to inspire and educate the
public by acquiring, conserving, studying, exhibiting and interpreting works
of art of the highest quality within (its) fields,' says its director, John
Walsh. It aims to provide visitors with 'an experience that will make them
want to return again and again.' In this it is succeeding.
But what was Getty thinking of? If southern California has a surfeit of
anything, it is a surfeit of fancy art. It is lousy with Old Masters. Why
didn't Getty donate his money to a hands-on war on poverty?
For example, the Los Angeles school system was described recently by The New
York Times as a stricken giant, hobbled by financial problems and hurting
from racial and ethnic strife. Many schoolchildren in Los Angeles, said the
Times, are impoverished, illiterate immigrants who have never read a book or
worn a pair of shoes and whose special needs are taxing the (mostly white)
teaching corps. Why didn't Getty aim his billions directly at the ghettos?
Rich people are still drooling over private art collections. I think that
they should stop it. If they cannot, they should stipulate, at their deaths,
that their pots and pans, their Turners and Cranachs, be auctioned to help
finance the war on want. Compared with that, nailing up Van Tromp Going
About to Please His Masters in a gallery in Malibu is both provocative and
decadent.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Records: Monstrous many notes] - Max Loppert on the merits
of Mozart opera on period instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mozart: Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail: 1. Monteverdi Choir, English Baroque
Soloists/John Eliot Gardiner. DG Archiv 435 857-2 (two CDs), and 2. Academy
of Ancient Instruments Orchestra and Chorus/Christopher Hogwood.
L'Oiseau-Lyre 430 339-2 (two CDs)
Mozart: La finta giardiniera. Concentus Musicus Wien/Nikolaus Harnoncourt.
Teldec 9031-72309-2 (three CDs)
DID THE Emperor Joseph really remark, after the premiere of Die Entfuhrung
aus dem Serail, 'Too beautiful for our ears, my dear Mozart, and monstrous
many notes'? The anecdote, often quoted, is probably apocryphal; but it
contains an astute observation, which is perhaps the cause of its regular
re-cycling. There is indeed a discernible imbalance at the opera's centre -
between the slightness of its Singspiel genre and subject matter and the
splendour, exuberance and sheer abundance of its musical substance.
Every bar overflows with marvels heightening the listener's delight and
simultaneously putting at risk the spectator's sense of dramatic continuity.
In every Entfuhrung performance, whether in the theatre or on record, a
basic problem of scale needs to be addressed at the outset  - in
oversimplified terms, the twin prongs of the dilemma are fulfilment of the
score's extravagant demands, on singers and instrumentalists alike, versus
maintenance of the necessary lightness of dramatic touch.
Two of the most recent recordings solve the problem more surely than most
performances of the opera I have heard. It can be no coincidence that,
unlike all previous Entfuhrung recordings, these employ 'period'-instrument
orchestras: seldom have the merits of doing so - tonal mass solid but not
oppressive, at-one-ness with voices, keenness of colour - seemed so obvious
(and, since the playing is expert on both recordings, the familiar failings
are entirely avoided). In both sets the dialogue is given in full (less on
DG); so are the musical numbers (with, for instance, those hair-raising bars
of far-flung decoration usually nipped out from Constanze's 'Martern aller
Arten') - yet not for a moment does the long opera drag or lag.
Hogwood's is the more intimate. He leaves the music to find its own shape
and direction; he does not make it his business to underline every rhythmic
accent or highlight every dynamic contrast. This works particularly well in
the popular-song-type numbers such as the final vaudeville, an andante of
the sort Gardiner tends to urge a degree too forcefully forward.
L'Oiseau-Lyre's leading singers are matched to the conductor's relaxed
Mozart manner: the quiet-spirited, gentle-toned Lynne Dawson and the
touchingly ardent Uwe Heilmann prove an unfailingly sympathetic leading
couple, but their ability to cope with the numerous technical challenges
Mozart threw their way is relatively modest - the brilliance that he
relished in his first Constanze, Caterina Cavalieri, is here considerably
dimmed.
The DG is based on the semi-staged Entfuhrung production that Gardiner
toured around Europe two years ago. There is a fizz, an on-the-toes quality
to the execution that amply compensates for the conductor's occasionally
over-rigorous beat: Gardiner's vitality, issuing as it plainly does from the
desire to tap as much as possible of the opera's peculiar musical energy, is
a fault on the right side. His Constanze, Luba Orgonasova, and Belmonte,
Stanford Olsen, sing with ease, a quiet mastery of style, beautiful tone.
They are true Entfuhrung virtuosos, less affecting, in places, than their
Oiseau-Lyre counterparts, but much more vocally assured.
DG's servant couple is preferable; neither Osmin, curiously, is quite up to
standard; both Selims make a strong effect. I shall want to return
occasionally to the old Beecham recording, for the incomparable charm and
gaiety of his conducting; I shall want to hear again such recorded
Entfuhrung singers of the past as Patzak, Dermota, Wunderlich, Gerhard
Unger, Edda Moser and Gottlob Frick. But for now at least, these are the
Entfuhrung recordings of choice.
Similar points can be made about the Teldec Finta giardiniera, latest in
Harnoncourt's recorded survey of all the Mozart operas. This work, written
seven years before Die Entfuhrung, is even more difficult to keep in balance
 -an opera buffa which along the way disgorges two astonishingly grand,
richly elaborated act-finales, a pastoral comedy for a septet of
romantically entwined characters which becomes darkened by episodes of
intrigue, jealousy and madness.
Again, the 'period' orchestra is a source of new-minted pleasures and
long-range dramatic possibilities unavailable on earlier Finta giardiniera
sets; and an even longer Mozart opera is here also given in full, without
making the listener long for the pruning scissors. Those expressive tics -
self-consciously underlined orchestral articulation, extremes of tempo
choice - that tend to divide the musical world into Harnoncourt admirers and
Harnoncourt detractors are less in evidence here; the recording was taken
'live' at a 1991 Vienna concert, but intrusive noises are few, atmospheric
excitements plentiful.
Violante, the aristocrat disguised as the garden-maid Sandrina, is Edita
Gruberova - pure and precisely focused, prodigious as ever in throwing off
passages of ornate vocal tracery, but notably lacking lacking in spunk and
spirit (she seems to have adopted some of the moonier mannerisms of the
middle-period Sutherland). Belfiore, whose jealousy has driven Violante into
hiding, is Uwe Heilmann - more secure than in the L'Oiseau-Lyre Entfuhrung
and every bit as involving.
Other parts are less remarkably taken - from this generalisation I except
Dawn Upshaw's sparky Serpetta. It is the trim cut and thrust of the ensemble
and the nimble movement through the opera's picaresque situations and
mercurial humours that afford the set its distinctive character, and win it
an enthusiastic recommendation.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Records: Long live the blues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL HARDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BLUES Is Alright sang Little Milton a little less than a a decade ago.
The faithful cheered, but in truth, the Blues seemed like a dying genre:
young blacks had turned to funk and even the crowd of white worshippers at
the holy grail thinned out as the likes of George Michael turned to the
softer sounds of 1970's soul which they refashioned as the basis of emotive
balladeering and dance music.
At the tiny Malaco label, Little Milton and fellow elderly blues survivors
(among them the marvellous Bobby Bland, ZZ Hill and Johnnie Taylor) went
through their traditional paces. The Blues Is Alright (MCD 7449), a greatest
hits of the label, confirms they were still legendary, but also that had
lost their ability to inspire younger listeners. The blues it seemed was
truly dead.
Then, seemingly from nowhere, came Robert Cray to refashion the blues and
achieve significant mainstream commercial success along the way. 1988's
Who's Been Talkin' (Charly CDCLM 101) captures him at his bluesiest and most
confident, a strident sinner confessing his sins and glorying in temptation,
knowing it will all end in pain. Then the trickle became a flood as lo and
behold legendary blues man John Lee Hooker, who made his first recordings in
1948, entered the 1990s with a series of hit albums. In his wake Buddy Guy
rekindled the flames of a dying career and also stormed the charts. The
blues, it suddenly seemed was very much alive. And so the re-issues (and
advertisements featuring blues men) gushed forth.
A good starting place for beginners is the budget offering 60 Great Blues
Recordings (Cascade CBOXCD 3) which spans recordings from the Flair and
Modern labels mostly from the 1950s. Apart from a few tracks by Hooker and
BB King it includes mostly little known performers. As a result, it is a
good working introduction to the blues as a genre. For more of the hits try
Sequel's The Blues Guitar Box 2 (NXTCD 185). Another triple CD package, it
touches more bases, including a fair number of white blues men, but,
possibly because its scope is larger, its impact is lesser. All Night Long
They Played The Blues (Ace CDCHD440) is another irresistitible compilation
of lesser lights, including Little Johnny Taylor, Saunders King, and the
wonderful Charles Brown, that works as a whole simply because the songs and
emotions tumble into each other seamlessly.
As the most successful blues man of the moment, naturally Hooker is the most
re-issued. Hence the six-CD set The Vee-Jay Years, 1955-1964 (Charly CDRED
Box 6) which includes virtually everything Hooker recorded during his ten
years with Vee Jay. Undoubtedly, a work of scholarship, it fails to capture
Hooker. Instead it merely suggests the variety of work he was capable of
without celebrating his laconic passion. For that you need Graveyard Blues
(Ace CDCHD421) a collection of early recording made for Specialty. Hooker's
chanted lyrics and repetitive guitar work may seem simple at first
listening, but their power remains undiminished after numerous plays, the
mark of someone who has teased an unconsidered passion from his music.
Memory, Pain (CDCHD438) is the title of Ace's second collection of Percy
Mayfield's recordings, and appropriately bleak they are. His biggest hit was
Please Send Me Someone To Love in 1950, but clearly he went unrequited.
Heard through a throng, Mayfield sounds like a a piano bar blues man, all
tinkle and sad saxes waiting for Bogart to make an appearance. Banish the
throng and you find one of the great poets of popular culture of the 1950s.
Like James Dean or Jean Paul Belmondo in a Bout De Souffle, characters who
strive for dignity and style but know they are not enough, Percy Mayfield
knows that the dawn brings forth no new hope. In his world, lost love is the
norm and suicide the major temptation, all held barely at an arm's distance
by the caressing sound of the coolest blues style ever. Or as he puts it: It
serves me right to suffer, it serves me right to be alone.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Records: Composers in person - David Murray on an
interesting series from EMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS NEW, expanded form, EMI holds the copyright to many recordings of
distinguished composers conducting and/or playing their own works: from
Lehar, Saint-Saens, Medtner and Holst to Hindemith and Messiaen. Its
'Composers in Person' series is going to represent more than 30 of them on
CDs, with the original recordings carefully re-mastered. That should whet
many appetites.
On these first releases, there is occasional hiss and crackle - and the odd
passage where a regular, faulty swish is audibly carried over from ancient
78rpm discs. Only aficionados will really want some of these releases: the
stamp of authenticity may sometimes be faint, the musical polish of some
performances inferior to some modern ones, the CD programmes constrained by
what this or that composer happened to put on record. That said, here are
quick notes on these first entries in the series.
Richard Strauss (CDC 7 54610 2) - his conducting of the pit-music, mostly
arranged by another hand, for a silent-film version of Der Rosenkavalier in
the mid-1920s (seen recently on TV) is illuminating about pace and emphasis.
In old age, Strauss used rightly to complain that his operas were being
subjected to ever slower, more languishing tempi. His performance of An
Alpine Symphony is almost a revelation: for once, none of its candidly
pictorial vignettes is allowed to outlast its welcome.
The curse of fake-symphonic pretentiousness is lifted, and whatever exactly
the 'symphony' amounts to - it sounds thoroughly taking, original, even
moving. I am not sure that any modern recording has captured its contrasted
effects so vividly, or rather any modern conductor; Strauss knew not only
precisely what he intended, but how to extract it from a sympathetic band
like the Bayerische Staatskapelle. The Stravinsky double album (CDC 7 54607
2) must count only as a supplementary volume to the huge,
all-but-compendious Sony collection I reviewed here a while ago. As soloist
in the Capriccio, the composer sounds tame, careful, studio-bound where
extrovert dash should be the order of the day.
Yet the album boasts notable attractions among its 1930s recordings. To the
great Symphony of Psalms the Alexis Vlassov Choir, whose members must have
been Russian expatriates, brought a passionate instinct for ecclesiastical
chant that I have not heard equalled in a modern concert.
The Octet had a team of crack French wind-players led by the flautist Marcel
Moyse, and their dry, nervy brilliance is still exciting. We also hear
Stravinsky with his long-term concert partner, the splendid violinist Samuel
Dushkin, in several of the transcriptions they devised together for their
recitals.
Milhaud (CDC 7 54604 2): the jovial composer features mostly as conductor,
with the benefit of characterful orchestral playing in tones that could
barely be imitated now. Those sounds - lean, pungent, often shrill - were
nonetheless what he wrote for, from the 1919 Boeuf sur le toit to the 1936
version of his Suite Provencale; and his own sense for treading a thin line
between cramped popular pastiche and unbuttoned vulgarity was unerring. So
it was too in his and Marcelle Meyer's account of the evergreen duo-piano
Scaramouche, rumba-finale and all.
Shostakovich (CDC 7 54606 2) is split between his 1958 recordings as soloist
in his two piano concerti, which now sound remarkably immediate, commanding
models (good trumpeter in no. 1), and some very uneven solo pieces. The
early 3 Fantastic Dances sound dreadful, as if he were tired of bothering
with them. The first four of the Preludes &amp; Fugues are thoughtful,
withdrawn, very much not concert-performances; better to hear Madame
Nikolaieva in them. The curdled recording of no. 24, the last pair, is of
uncertain provenance, but Shostakovich's playing there is far more vital and
communicative than in any of the others.
It should have been a good idea to pair Poulenc and Britten (CDC 7 54605 2)
on a disc with their long-term tenor partners, but the choice of works makes
them a queasy combination. Pierre Bernac (in his prime in 1946) addressed
Poulenc's wide-ranging, deeply felt Eluard cycle Tel jour, telle nuit with
heart-seizing insights. He did no less for other songs to lighter, teasing
verse by Apollinaire, Aragon and Louise de Vilmorin - always with the
composer's inspired prompting from the piano.
After those, Britten's 7 Michelangelo Sonnets and his 'Holy Sonnets of John
Donne' for the voice of Peter Pears sound abstractly intense, intricate,
crabbed by their fascination with ostinato patterns and other such. What
seems to be the nub of the problem is exposed in the Michelangelo songs: how
many Italians would even recognise the tight, dry Pears/Britten settings as
Italian, let alone as answering to Michelangelo's brave, unconstrained
feeling?

FT  13 MAR 93 / Records: Top notch requiems - Ronald Crichton reviews two
Brahms requiems and Gounod's 'Mors et Vita'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO recordings of the German Requiem of Brahms may come as a revelation to
those with early memories of partly amateur performances - voices strained,
strings scraped and wind squealed or burbled. The shock comes not only from
first-rate singing and playing but from the use of period (1860) instruments
 -among the obvious gains are sparing use of string vibrato and hard
drumsticks. The profound sighs of the opening of the new EMI set with the
Schutz Choir of London and the London Classical Players under Roger
Norrington (CDC 7 54658 2), will immediately show what I mean.
As well as clarity Norrington's reading has a plainness and restraint both
unexpectedly moving and well matched to the religious side of Brahms's
temperament. Baptised a Lutheran in Hamburg, he did not become an orthodox
believer, but was a devoted student of the Bible. From the Bible he chose
the text for the Requiem, less concerned with the peaceful repose of the
dead than with consolation for the bereaved living. Norrington's reticence
does not exclude high drama: the timpani at the climax of the second
movement (the slow march in three-four time), are terrifying. The more
impenetrable, thicket-like pages of the fugal sections are less daunting
than usual.
Those who like a more generally dramatic approach and a warmer, more
resonant acoustic may try the 1991 Philips version with John Eliot Gardiner
conducting the Monteverdi Choir and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et
Romantique (432 140-2). In his booklet note Gardiner talks of laying bare
the rock face of Brahms's texture. It turns out to have quite a few plants
clinging to it, but many will think no worse of it for that. The two last
movements in particular are impressively handled. For once the consoling
final pages sound like a real ending and the arch form of the whole is
perceptible.
Gardiner's soloists, Charlotte Margiono and Rodney Gilfry, are luxurious.
The soprano's exquisite, ethereal notes remind me of an admired Bach singer
of the inter-war years, Dorothy Silk. Norrington's Lynne Dawson and Olaf
Bar, less luscious, are equally convincing. Norrington's speeds are slightly
faster. There is room on his disc for the Burial Song, op. 13, another
revealing glimpse of the North German side of Brahms.
For a complete contrast turn to Gounod's Mors et Vita (with Michel Plasson
conducting the Orfeon Donostiarra and the Toulouse Capitole Orchestra (EMI
CDS 754459 2, 2 CDs). Gounod was a Catholic who came under the influence of
the Dominican preacher Lacordaire and at one time contemplated entering the
priesthood. For most of his career he was torn between the attractions of
sacred and profane love - but more prosaically, between church and opera
house.
Mors et Vita, a 'sacred trilogy', was written for the Birmingham Festival of
1885 as a continuation of Gounod's Redemption, given there with huge success
a few years earlier. Mors et Vita was dedicated to the Pope, Leo XIII, whose
sermons Gounod had translated into French. The first and longest of the
three parts is a Requiem, using the traditional Latin text. The style of the
Trilogy is clearly designed for large, resonant buildings (town halls, the
Albert Hall or Westminster Cathedral), where the echoes can prolong the
sound of the slow-moving harmonies. Outwardly simple music, (eminently)
accessible to large audiences.
Accessible, but not trivial or vulgar. There is an a cappella double chorus
(Gounod adored Palestrina); elsewhere the smooth surface is ruffled by
chromatic flurries, and there are hints (quite sinister in this context) of
the whole-tone scale. The large orchestra is discreetly used. Plasson's
soloists are distinguished: Barbara Hendricks, John Aler and Jose van Dam
spin their grateful lines with faultlessly even tone. The alto, Nadine
Denize, blends easily in spite of greater vibrancy in her fine voice. The
choir from San Sebastian offer a rich, firm body of sound but they make less
of the Latin words than the English choirs do of Luther's German in Brahms.
Plasson steers a skilful course between the twin dangers of hustle and
inertia.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: Berlin after Karajan - Andrew Clark finds Claudio
Abbado revitalising the orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Claudio Abbado hosted a dinner for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra
during last month's Italian tour, he told the musicians he did not want to
be called maestro. 'I'm Claudio - for everyone', he said. Returning to
Berlin, orchestra and conductor plunged into rehearsals for a concert cycle
inspired by the late 18th century German poet Friedrich Holderlin -
featuring composers as diverse as Ligeti, Rihm and Reger.
No two events better symbolise the changes in Europe's leading concert
orchestra since the death of Herbert von Karajan in 1989. No-one would have
dreamed of addressing Karajan by his first name, nor would he have
championed the 20th century programmes that dominate the orchestra's 1992-3
season, the first to bear Abbado's stamp as artistic director.
There was bound to be a reaction to Karajan's 35-year reign, but few can
have imagined it would be so fast and sweeping. In the vacuum after
Karajan's death, the musicians seized the chance to move out of his shadow
and modernise their image. Abbado was the conductor best equipped to share
responsibility for the changes.
Where Karajan was authoritarian, Abbado is mild and approachable. Conflicts
which marred relations between chief conductor and orchestra in the 1980s
are unlikely to be repeated. The musicians now have more control over their
working conditions, personnel and recordings than any other contract
orchestra. Tours are no longer dependent on Karajan's behind-the-scenes
deal-making: the orchestra goes where and with whom it wants - in May to
London with Bernard Haitink, followed by Israel and the US with Abbado. The
emphasis now is more on the music than the man in charge.
But Abbado is no door-mat: he has set out his artistic agenda and won the
orchestra's loyalty by virtue of his musicianship and imagination. Despite
warnings from the prophets of doom, expensive projects like last year's
concert performances of Il viaggio a Reims and this month's Holderlin cycle
have been an artistic and box-office success.
Abbado's repertoire and skills have nonetheless proved double-edged. Widely
respected for his Mahler and Brahms performances, he has yet to prove
himself in other core areas of the orchestra's Austro-German tradition. His
Mozart, Beethoven, Bruckner and Strauss lack the authenticity he brings to
Berg, Musorgsky and Verdi.
Nor is he a sound-merchant in the Karajan mould. The orchestra's distinctive
Klang has lightened up, becoming more slender and digestible, less
luxuriant. The increase in 20th century repertoire may be partly
responsible. The orchestra has also started engaging conductors with a
distinctly un-Karajanesque concept of sound, like Nikolaus Harnoncourt and
Pierre Boulez. Another contributory factor is the turnover of personnel
since the late 1980s - the orchestra is noticeably younger, more
international.
But the brighter, more energetic sound also reflects Abbado's technique and
personality. He is less of a perfectionist than Karajan, less
disciplinarian. Where Karajan kneaded the sound in circular motions,
gathering it and controlling it in a tactile manner, Abbado is more
spontaneous in performance - the arms flung open, the overall effect more
explosive. The orchestra sounds less like a machine, the music less awesome
and remote.
Unlike its chief rival, the Vienna Philharmonic, which guards its tradition
without recourse to a chief conductor, the Berlin Philharmonic has invested
heavily in change. Under Abbado, it is becoming a less exclusive, more
versatile and forward-looking instrument. In the competitive musical world
of the 1990s, the two are counting on each other to make it work.
The Berlin Philharmonic's Holderlin cycle opened with three sold-out Abbado
concerts contrasting Holderlin settings by contemporary and Romantic
composers. Abbado also took part as conductor and pianist in a chamber music
programme of Nono, Maderna, Kurtag and Holliger.
The choice of theme reflects Abbado's knowledge of and identification with
German culture, as well as his familiarity with postwar Italian composers
who have been attracted to Holderlin's world. Holderlin (1770-1843) is a
poet whose verse expresses a longing for the spirit of the classical era and
a belief in nature and beauty as healing forces. Mentally ill for the last
37 years of his life, he continued writing in fragments.
Holderlin's musical appeal lies in the melody and rhythm of his verse, as
well as the purity of his German. The challenge facing the composer is to
preserve and, if possible, enhance this appeal. Giacomo Manzoni's Holderlin
frammento for chorus and orchestra came over unmistakeably as a post-1960s
product - a complex web of aleatory effects and choral echoes, requiring the
musicians to scrape and stamp their feet, and ending appropriately with the
poet's words 'Pardon if I do not make myself well enough understood'.
By contrast, Wolfgang Rihm's waif-like Holderlin-Fragmente for baritone and
orchestra captures the mood of innocent isolation in the text, using simple
brush strokes for each word (cleanly enunciated by Johannes Kosters).
Ligeti's Drei Phantasien for unaccompanied chorus shows a similarly keen and
detailed response, avoiding the self-conscious vocal effects of Heinz
Holliger's Die Jahreszeiten or the anaemic quality of the Holderlin extract
from Nono's Prometeo. Only Richard Strauss, in his Drei Hymnen (sung by
Karita Mattila with Elysian beauty of tone), rode roughshod over his
material, clothing it in the same majestic-heroic flourishes he applied to
everything else.
Thanks to its vivid contrasts and Abbado's inspired direction, the main
programme had a powerful cumulative impact, ending with the nostalgic glow
of Reger's An die Hoffnung and the heavenly harmony of Brahms'
Schicksalslied. The chamber music concert, less convincing in overall
effect, included a soporific 45-minute recitation from Hyperion, which I
would have gladly sacrificed for a chance to hear Britten's Holderlin
settings. The Leipzig Radio Chorus, directed by Gert Frischmuth, made an
outstanding contribution to both events.
Claudio Abbado conducts the Royal Opera's new production of 'Pelleas et
Melisande' at Covent Garden, first night March 24. The Berlin Philharmonic
gives its annual Europa concert on May 1 at the Royal Albert Hall, conducted
by Bernard Haitink

FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: Concern for the young - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO 1, with its usual concern for the young, gave Rape is a Four-letter
Word on Monday (International Women's Day, celebrated only on Radio 2).
Radio 1 followed a listen-to-me title with sensible advice from a judge,
police officers, 'agony aunts' of both male - and female-oriented journals
and a psychologist. It is reckoned that only one rape in ten is reported; in
three-quarters of those that are, the woman knows her partner. The expert
presenter was Nicky Campbell, and he chaired a live discussion afterwards.
'I was very drunk,' one victim admitted. 'I was only fifteen.' More such
programmes are clearly needed, with items like the helpline on 0800 850 800.
And indeed next day Radios 1 and 2 had a joint 90-minute phone-in, Talking
'bout my Generation, where the young and the adult voiced their respective
concerns. What I heard was sadly full of old, rather Tory, thoughts. But
next Monday Radio 1 begins its three-part Consequences about rape, pregnancy
and parenthood.
In the circumstances, Saturday's Body Politics, Radio 3 on sex in the 1920s,
had less than its potential interest. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Out of the
Shadows, about the 1920s movies, was good on the reactions of European
directors to the post-war explosion of the industry (led by the Americans);
and Friday gave us two giants of the decade, Le Corbusier and TS Eliot.
Radio 3's Sunday play, Sarah Woods's Silence in Blue kept the sex offstage.
Lisa, crossed in love and sad at an abortion, goes to Australia to
recuperate, but decides instead to drown herself scuba-diving, when her
unborn child flies up to the skies. A mixture of simple travel-information
and interior thought, this struck me as one of the silliest plays I ever
heard.
On Monday, Radio 4 did better with Nothing Happens in Carmincross, adapted
by Mike Gerrard from Benedict Kiely's novel. The title represents the New
York thoughts of Mervyn, an Irish-American; but how wrong he is, for
Carmincross is in Northern Ireland, Radio 4's top drama locale. Mervyn (Ian
McElhinney) links up with Deborah (Kate Binchy), an old flame followed about
by her neglected consort Mandrake. After a look at Ireland, they attend a
wedding party at a Carmincross hotel; a warning comes from the IRA, then a
bomb that breaks up the party but reconciles Deb and Mandrake. This is
reported in New York as a 'distraction'. Eoin O'Callaghan was the director.
Neil Kinnock was John Humphrys's victim in his courteously critical series
On the Ropes (Radio 4, Monday). He was frank about what he confessed as
errors and expressed no hope of being Party-leader again. Perhaps he should
be in Radio 4's Friday series, Famous for 15 Minutes.
The Ghost of Thomas Kempe is a great story by Penelope Lively read through
the week by Willie Rushton - the first Radio 5 youth-offering I have really
liked, except the cricket. Kemp turns up in our own day as a poltergeist in
the house where 10-year-old James lives, and tries to involve him in his
activities, to everyone's alarm. Full of fun, and very well done.
On Sundays, the World Service series on South Asia has been covering
religions. I caught this week's, on the Parsees and the Indian Jews. I
learnt much about the Zoroastrian Parsees and their devotion to Ahura Mazda.
Their numbers are dwindling, due to a housing scarcity, though the Hindoos
have always been on good terms, apart from their Towers of Silence for the
dead, which will not do in multi-storey Bombay. The Jewish settlements are
diminishing too - they tend to move westward to Israel.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: Russian soul bared - Poetry in Performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE ARE AGAINST the McDonaldsisation of life] We are against the
international conspiracy of vulgarity against human subtleties' thundered
the Thunderer himself Yegveny Yevtushenko, poet of all the Russias, who flew
into London this week for an unexpected two-date tour which began in the
cramped surroundings of Waterstone's, Charing Cross Road.
There is no-one else quite like Yevtushenko in the world of poetry. His
demeanour is that of a man accustomed to being feted the world over - the
Hollywood-like aura of his personality; the extravagance of his charm; the
peackockish nature of his dress, which included a tremendous woollen scarf
as red as the Red Flag itself (though made by Burberrys); the dramatic
exuberance of his verbal delivery.
Yevtushenko is the populist demagogue of poetry, a filler of football stadia
in his native land; the poet whose books move off the shelves faster than
bread. All his life he played a dangerous, venturesome game with the Soviet
authorities, sniping at the heels of the tsars of communism. He never
emigrated; he preferred to fight the system from within and, like Neruda in
Chile, he became an Untouchable: too popular to be made away with; the
licenced beast; the conscience-solver; the token of liberalisation who was
rewarded with his dachas and permissions to travel when and wherever. But
was he puppet or puppeteer?
Now in his sixtieth year, he seems as irrepressible as ever, ranting and
charming by turns; punching his fist into the air, kissing the hand of his
English publisher - the very personification of the virtues and style of Old
Mother Russia, whose travails he continues to lament in his poetry. The fact
is, of course, that the two are indistinguishable. And no, it is not mere
vanity when he says, as he did this week, 'For me, the most important thing
is to express myself. My main fear is the experience of this life could just
be gone - dissolved in the abyss of oblivion'. The fact is that he must
survive in order to speak for Russia's soul. Russia needs him. But he has
learned a thing or two by surviving so long. 'Yes, I am praying,' he told
us. 'I'm working for the future of Russia - but all prophets are false. I
was an MP for three and a half years, then I happily left this field. In the
beginning politicians are innocent liars - they are forced to lie by us. I
am a poetician, not a politician.'
Some of the audience thought that delightful piece of wordplay too fine a
distinction - but when he went on to read 'Between the City of Yes and the
City of No' in the original Russian, dancing and prancing on his toes,
crossing his arms like a pair of flourished sabres, writhing his body like a
snake, and turning up the volume of his voice to an almighty growl, it was
quickly conquered.
India is the second-largest publisher of English-language books in the
world, but its literature remains largely unknown in the west. To lighten
our darkness somewhat, the Arts Council is currently touring a quartet of
Indian writers, which include the poets Nissim Ezekiel and Meena Alexander.
The elderly Nissim Ezekiel, a spry, fragile figure in shabby grey flannels
and blue plimsolls, is a poet of quick, darting, sardonic humour, who enjoys
working in many different forms and, being a successful playwright too,
projecting different personalities through his poems. One of a sequence of
'very Indian poems in Indian English' entitled 'Soap' dramatised an argument
between a customer who had bought a defective bar of soap and a bristly,
pugnacious shopkeeper. As Ezekiel explained to us, he is a poet who roams
the streets of Bombay listening out for those quirkish turns of phrase and
strange dislocations of language that give it spice and humour.
Meena Alexander, on the other hand, a poet who now lives in Manhattan and
spent much of her early life shuttling between the Sudan and Kerala, was a
more troubling figure altogether. Her poems often concern themselves with
terrible acts of violence - racist incidents, murder, rape, beatings - but
they were delivered to the accompaniment of such winning gestures, and with
such a high gloss of charm, that we quite forgot ourselves in them.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: Harvey's Passion - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS taken 12 years for Passion and Resurrection, Jonathan Harvey's 1981
'church opera' for Winchester Cathedral, to make the journey to London. At
Westminster Abbey, on Thursday, it left a remarkable impression - a
90-minute work of controlled mastery, economical in its forces (15 singers
taking 18 parts, small orchestra), sure in their employment, and
hypnotically powerful in overall effect - and so the delay seemed equally
remarkable. Plainly, Passion and Resurrection ought by now to have won for
itself a regularity of performance comparable at least to that of the
Britten Church Parables, of which it is a distant relative.
Harvey's aim was to make his drama - 12 scenes showing the final episodes of
Christ's life, followed by his death and resurrection - flower out of church
service in the manner of the medieval church dramas. So the opera is
enclosed within a liturgical event, and the audience is invited to join in
the congregational singing of plainsong hymns and the concluding Alleluias
and Amen. But, far from proving too limiting, too 'localised' in scope, the
blend of opera and liturgical ritual has been so precisely achieved that
even to an outsider to Christian worship it affords a wholly gripping
experience.
The nice judgment of where exactly to place those hymns - at moments of
climactic intensity in the unfolding of the narrative - is just one token of
Harvey's distinctive, confidently sustained artistic vision. He has bound
his scenes (most of them dialogues supported by spare accompaniment) by
means of instrumental interludes which vary in style, vocal idiom and
language according to the dictates of the dramatic moment - from modern
resumes of church-musical forms in modal harmonies to agonisedly angular
non-tonal outbursts.
Another token of the composer's skill, highly yet unassumingly theatrical,
is his placing and contrast of timbre - 'antique' brass echoing awesomely,
the shiver and tremble of percussion, the haloes of high harmonics painted
by the strings around the recitative. With beautifully calculated and
contained radiance the austerity of the male-voice-dominated ensemble is
eventually relieved by the female-voice incursions of the 'Resurrection
Garden', which builds to a concord of honestly attained grandeur.
The sum is a purposeful, compelling modern revival - from the inside, as it
were - of an ancient artistic form. The text, extracted in modern-English
translation (by Michael Wadsworth) from an Italian and a French medieval
passion-plays, was on Thursday unclearly delivered by too many of the
participants. This apart, the performance was of very fine quality - played
by Docklands Sinfonietta, sung by Michael George (Jesus), Paul Agnew
(Pilate) and Juliet Schiemann (Mary Magdalene) at the head of a devoted
cast, and conducted by Martin Neary.
As the latest offering of the Arts Council's Contemporary Music Network,
this simply staged Passion and Resurrection proceeds over the next ten days
to the cathedrals of Canterbury, Liverpool, Sheffield and Llandaff, and to
St Mary's Church, Bath. It is well worth catching in any of those places.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: More rows about the rough stuff - Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT BEGINS with a dust-storm on the horizon; swells to a giant twister; then
howls through the land turning homes to matchsticks and humans to
tumbleweed. It is turbulent and merciless; it is as regular as Christmas.
The violence-on-the-screen debate, in case you have been on another planet,
is back again. In the cinema, fate or chance or Hollywood have appointed
1993 the Year of the Shocker. Films like Reservoir Dogs, Man Bites Dog,
Hellraiser 3 and next week's Candyman - the last two films courtesy of our
own Clive Barker - ensure a high blood quotient in the cinema. Henry,
Portrait Of A Serial Killer has re-opened debate in the video arena. And TV
we know about from our own PM, though his idea of an average evening's
viewing seems to differ from that of others.
All this plus a new book, Hollywood vs America by Michael Medved
(HarperCollins, Pounds 17.99), presenting in print the case for family
values and the Moral Right: 370 pages of anger and sorrow on every supposed
exemplar of movie mayhem, from A. Schwarzenegger to B. DePalma via M.
Culkin. (The star of Home Alone gets a knuckle-rap for the way he treats
burglars.)
This row about rough stuff in the movies - let me leave the small screen to
other specialists - returns every decade and brings out the worst and best
in everyone. Twenty years ago it was A Clockwork Orange and Straw Dogs; ten
years ago it was the video nasties. Now it is 'Should we or should we not
encourage films about serial killers and snuff film-makers?' These two are
the flavour of the season. And the season began last year with the
big-screen release of films like Henry, GoodFellas and Basic Instinct, plus
the startling Oscar-sweep of The Silence Of The Lambs.
This year's New Violence builds on those examples, especially on Lambs and
Henry. The first offered a documentation of the physical/surgical realities
of a supposed serial killing case, plus a consultant psychopath (Anthony
Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter) who mesmerised the world with his mixture of
beast and boffin. The second aired the hitherto all-but-taboo topic of snuff
movies and DIY voyeurism in the video age.
Linking the two films, and their 1993 offspring, is the notion of murder not
for gain but for sport, spectacle or (in Lecter's case) sardonic
pseudoscience. Man Bites Dog has a 'hero' who records his own brutal
killings on video-camera. Candyman has a serial psychotic who wields a hook.
And the scene in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs which had hardened
critics and fellow film-makers gasping in shock or even exiting the cinema
featured a crook torturing a cop with a razor.
What made this scene unnerving was not any physical explicitness: indeed the
camera cut away at moment of impact between sharp instrument and
about-to-be-severed ear. It was the fact that the torturer admitted to
having no information he wanted to extract. He merely enjoyed torturing.
Each new movie-making age finds a new stratum of evil to explore, and each
new movie-going age must decide if the works on show are honourable or
meretricious. If the second, the usual two-word charge sheet reads
'gratuitous violence'. But what marks out today's cinema of cruelty is that
the phrase has lost pejorative point in an age when films featuring brutal
or sadistic events are about the excitement that characters obtain from that
seemingly motiveless cruelty. The phrase 'gratuitous violence' moves from a
description of the film's sensibility to a definition of its subject.
Years of censorship tradition and media moralising have decreed that murder,
torture or beating are justified as a dramatic spectacle if there is a sound
dramatic reason or motive. It can be for crime passionel or revenge; it can
happen in the hurly-burly of a crime or robbery; it can be the cathartic
rough justice meted out in last reel by hero to villain.
What it cannot be is violence for fun. Hence the seminal brouhaha, two
decades ago, over Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This featured a gang of
London bovver boys who beat up whom they chose and how they chose, wafted
from one attack-ground to another on a tide of sadistic impulse. When a
series of 'copycat' crimes followed the film's release in Britain, Kubrick
withdrew it and has not allowed it to be shown in UK cinemas again.
It remains a moot point whether a film like A Clockwork Orange actually
creates violence or gives a new style and direction to those already waiting
to commit it. Those who rush to the censorship prescription disregard this
point along with many others. To author Michael Medved's credit in Hollywood
vs. America, he condemns the folly of official intervention. But like many
denouncers of screen violence who also denounce statutory censorship, he is
censoriously devoted to the notion that a broader type of copycatting
exists: whereby impressionable filmgoers catch the 'general' habit of
violence from a film even if they do not mimic the specific deeds depicted.
The evidence - and Medved cites yards of it - still fails to prove that this
broader form of imitation exists. It seems at least arguable that movies
take their cue from life as much as, if not more than, life does from
movies; and that the eruption in the early 1990s of films about violence for
violence's sake is a response to a world where, long before the 1990s, the
chronicling of cases involving crimes-for-kicks or obscurely motivated
brutalities has occupied many a Western newspaper page.
What disturbs us about films concerning violence-for-pleasure - those in
which gratuitous violence moves from style to subject - is the seeming
motivational void around the crimes or outrages and the viewer's inability
to get a moral handhold on the subject.
There is no easy catharsis in films like Reservoir Dogs or Man Bites Dog, as
in the make-my-day violence dispensed by hero to villain in films from Dirty
Harry to Under Siege. There is no supernatural get-out clause, as in a
horror film where everything can be blamed on the Devil or the Beyond. Above
all, there is no ready moral which we can extract after the film, which
might make up for our bewilderment during it as we search for
motive/reason/explanation.
No ready moral except one. The box-office revenue proving that we the public
are drawn to films like these, by the tens of millions, suggests in turn
that violence-for-thrills is not really an arcanum at all. We all recognise,
even when we most cry innocence or ignorance, the attraction and excitement
of 'gratuitous' violence. And we all respond - licenced by the fantasy that
we are watching fiction - to the queasy truth that lucid intelligence can
co-exist with human bestiality (Hannibal Lecter).
We also live in a world besieged day by day by the evidence of 'motiveless'
crime or cruelty for kicks. Do the movies shape monsters or do monsters
shape the movies? If the next frontier in the Cinema of Violence is the film
where violence is its own reward and excitement, human beings might turn the
light of enquiry onto themselves before shining it censoriously on a genre
they pretend to condemn as alien when it may be a part, however small, of
each of us.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: Question of attribution - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVE THE sackings in the London auction salerooms, which have claimed some
well respected experts, combined with intense pressure on specialist
departments to hit profit targets, had a debilitating effect on the veracity
of the auction rooms' catalogues?
In the current recession fewer good items are being put up for auction, but
dealers complain that not only has there been a substantial falling off in
quality in recent months, but also in the accuracy of the catalogue
descriptions. In pictures, the main complaint is that the actual canvas can
bear little relation to its glossy photograph in the catalogue: anyone
foolish enough to bid without viewing the lot could be disappointed with
their purchase. But generally, catalogue entries on paintings, especially
expensive paintings, are almost overburdened with information.
The problem lies in sectors where time causes wear and tear to antiques and
the restorer has been active - notably ceramics and furniture. One recent
sale in particular, of furniture at Sotheby's in February, has caused a
great deal of concern among dealers, many of whom felt that some lots were
not all that they were made out to be.
Dealers are in an invidious position. They are both the great rivals of the
salerooms and also their best customers. Many of the doubtful lots will at
some time have passed through the hands of dealers and carry their
attributions. Dealers also make their biggest profits when their expertise
enables them to snap up poorly catalogued treasures. But they also worry
that if a private collector buys a wrongly attributed antique the whole
business suffers in the long run.
Furniture dealers are never likely to agree with all the catalogue entries
but in this auction the criticisms were vociferous. 'Surely those 18th
century wall lights are modern?' 'That Queen Anne armchair has new legs.
They are described as 'good' but if they are they justify an estimate of
Pounds 10,000, not Pounds 5,000'. 'Those 18th century armchairs have modern
needlework'. 'These 18th century pier glasses have 20th century carving'.
One particular lot caused a great deal of concern. A pair of parcel gilt
window seats, which sold for Pounds 30,000, was reckoned to be modern. And
so it went on. (Sotheby's disputes the fact that it is cutting any corners.
Furniture expert Charles Walford had re-examined the above mentioned pieces
when making condition reports and 'saw no reason to doubt them whatsoever'.)
Many of these opinions might be debatable but there was enough consensus for
the dealers to be taken seriously. They do not blame the cataloguers. They
attribute any solecisms to the extra workload caused by the staff cuts at
the auction houses, and the pressure to make every item seem attractive, an
impossible task when only the most desperate owners will dispose of decent
objects in the current depressed market. One prominent dealer described a
catalogue as 'just a load of lot numbers.'
Now that the salerooms frequently sell direct to the private collector they
must make sure that, in difficult times, they do not sacrifice accuracy in
the pressure to achieve turnover targets.
Last year a half of all the West End's box office money came from just ten
long running modern musicals. In 1993 it should be even higher with the
successful launch of Crazy for You, and with City of Angels and Sunset
Boulevard to come. The public's appetite to forget its troubles with
escapist nostalgia knows no bounds.
In the two days after it opened last week Crazy for You took almost Pounds
300,000 at the box office, a record for producer Michael White. But then
Crazy for You is a big show in every way. It re-opened the Prince Edward
Theatre, refurbished at a cost of Pounds 3m, and it cost another Pounds 3m
to put on. The money comes from Roger Horchow, and his friends.
Horchow is an American mail order magnate who sold out to General Cinema for
Dollars 117m - which allows him to indulge his passion for the music of the
Gershwins. It is proving a profitable passion: he is recouping handsomely on
the Broadway production, and, despite weekly running costs of Pounds
150,000, the exuberant West End show, with its old fashioned values in terms
of costumes, chorus girls and ritzy song and dance numbers, should hit the
spot with the middle aged, the middle class, indeed middle England generally
 -traditional theatre goers who in recent years have been starved of
product.
So farewell, then, the Arts Council of Great Britain, Lord Keynes'
idealistic post-War creation which was to usher in the Brave New World. In
an almost unrecorded move the government's lukewarm sop to Scottish
nationalism this week deposited the ACGB to the dustbin. Now Scotland and
Wales will have their own independent Arts Councils and there will be an
English Arts Council operating in London. An Act of Parliament will be
needed to make the changes official.
It all seems very messy. The Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales
will hand over the annual subsidy to the Councils but the actual sum, in
theory, will still be negotiated from the Treasury by Peter Brooke, the
Heritage Secretary. As things stand at the moment the projections are that
the grants for the next two years will represent real cuts in funding.
Surely the Scots and the Welsh will not stand for this at the start of a new
regime.
The arts in Scotland and Wales could gain from the inevitable politicking.
Just before the election last year the Scottish Office somehow found Pounds
500,000 to help Scottish Opera out of a financial embarrassment. Welsh
National Opera also received a sizeable hand out from the Welsh Minister.
Local pressures could mean that the main arts organisations in the two
countries will do well out of the new arrangements by playing one Minister
off against the other while the English Arts Council may become a poor
relation.

IN A HOTEL GARDEN by Gabriel Josipovici Carcanet Pounds 12.95, 148 pages
XANTHIPPIC DIALOGUES by Roger Scruton Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15.99, 277
pages
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT by Robert McCrum Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 225
pages
SINGLE people often have a surrogate family, the sort now called nuclear,
good listeners over the washing up, reassuringly domestic. 'Fish Pie', the
second chapter of Gabriel Josipovici's In A Hotel Garden, consists almost
entirely of dialogue over a family supper, with interruptions from the
sharp-eared son. Even the adult talk is elliptically plain although, like
ordinary chat well recorded, it suggests what may or may not be, what
happened or did not or might have done.
Ben has been on holiday in the Dolomites and, back in London, is telling his
friends Fran and Rick about it: well, something about it. Earlier, walking
the dog, he has told Rick how his girlfriend Sand left him straight after
the holiday and, with relief, he disposed of the debris in black plastic
bags. Narrative then tells more of what happened on the holiday, a meeting
with Lilli, a Jewish woman on her way home from Siena, where she was looking
for her grandmother's past; a great mountain walk with her; Lilli's stay in
Siena, reliving a family farewell made final by the Holocaust.
Of all this, Lilli's Jewishness in particular, Ben understands little,
though he feels much and guesses something. Lilli's experience of the hotel
garden in Siena, and Lilli herself, remain mysterious to him, glowing with
some inner importance, some experience of ineffable pain, some perhaps
misunderstood metaphor. This extraordinary book can be read in an hour, but
it glows on in the senses like the rock on the postcard Ben sends his
friends that, touched by the setting sun, glows in the darkness.
Almost without descriptions except of landscape in the mountain walk, it
offers a kind of otherness in which each question leads to another, each
door opens, like the hotel door onto the garden, onto other lives, memories
and cultures, asking complex, endlessly circular questions.
Roger Scruton's Xanthippic Dialogues, a riotous send-up of scholarly
writing, can be read in two ways. You can read the footnotes, which are
numerous and often long, ignoring the text but ending with the index, which
of course will take you back to it. This index is said to be compiled by one
of Flann O'Brien's creations, HP de Selby, and needs cryptographic talents,
since most of its names do not appear in the text, only echoes of them,
internal quotations, hints and ideas.
Or you can read the text, supposedly discovered in modern times, under odd
circumstances. Socrates' wife Xanthippe, Plato's mother Perictione, his
sister Potone and his nurse Castollux, Praxiteles' model Phryne and assorted
ancient Grecian ladies are assembled to rethink and humanise our
philosophical past and put the record straight. Each is a vivid character,
Xanthippe vividest of all: not a shrew or a harpy as history remembers her,
but a sympathetic, sharp-witted, clear-eyed companion to the less than
heroic curmudgeon she calls Socks.
If philosophy seems an unlikely subject for comedy, try this.
Robert McCrum's The Psychological Moment suffers by comparison with two such
companions, having neither numinous qualities like the first nor scholarly
fun like the second. Of course plain realism may produce as good a result,
but in this case it seems inadequate for its subjects - betrayal, grief and
guilt. It is an upmarket thriller about dirty tricks in Northern Ireland
and, because the narrator went to live in America when he was nine and grew
up to become one of Jimmy Carter's speechwriters, it is written in American
English.
Dense and often confusing in its action it has Sam Gilchrist, born Seymour
le Fevre, writing an account of things that happened years earlier, a task
of filial impiety made possible by his father's death. For the first
chapters, when it is impossible to know what weight to give people and
events, things remain uninteresting - near names, places and historical
signposts: not mysterious, simply a jumble of fictional facts. But later
they pick up character, the pace quickens and its Anglo-American view of
English life throws new light on familiar places. It may be faint praise,
since it clearly aspires to more, to call it a good read; but so it is.

DEGREE OF GUILT by Richard North Patterson Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 548
pages
HANDS ON by Andrew Rosenheim Mandarin Pounds 5.99, 282 pages
THE LAST STATION by Jay Parini HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 290 pages
DISAPPEARANCE by David Dabydeen Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 7.99, 180 pages
IN A hotel room in San Francisco, America's most famous modern novelist lies
dead. Next to him, still clutching the gun that killed him, a beautiful
woman struggles to rearrange her clothing. She is a nationally known TV
journalist and she has just fended off a rape attack, the kind of attack
associated with the likes of Mike Tyson or William Kennedy Smith. She has
been forced to kill to protect her honour - or so she claims, and who is
going to argue with her?
Yet there is no evidence of sexual arousal in the victim and the scratches
on the woman appear to have been self-inflicted. She certainly could not
have fired the gun the way she explained it to the police. Was she really
attacked or is she only faking? And if she is faking, why?
Step forward Californian lawyer Christopher Paget, world renowned as the man
who uncovered a Watergate-style scandal a few years back and forced the
resignation of America's President. Paget is the man to defend the woman on
a murder charge, if anyone is. He knows her very well, after all. They
enjoyed a brief fling 15 years ago and have a son to prove it.
But is the mother of his child really to blame for the killing, and if so,
how much to blame? The degree of guilt is impossible to judge in a case like
this. It is a subject that has been extensively aired in real life recently
and the author makes no secret of his debt to the Kennedy Smith trial and
the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas sexual harassment case. He tells a good
story, though without the dramatic flair of a Scott Turow. But it should
make a splendidly slick movie in due course.
The victim in Degree of Guilt was America's most famous living novelist. In
Hands On, a second novel by Andrew Rosenheim, the victim is America's most
famous living poet, a four-times married old reprobate who is the father of
computer whizz kid Robert Madison. Robert has abandoned a professorship at
Harvard for a job at Oxford, where he is the Artificial Intelligence guru
for an electronics company, charged specifically with the task of teaching a
computer to write.
The author is obviously talking from the heart because he himself came to
Oxford as a Rhodes scholar and stayed to become Director of Electronic
Publishing at OUP. He is as well placed as anyone to make a computer write,
one day. Meantime he is indulging in a little wish fulfilment with a blackly
comic tale of computer programming and corporate life in the electronics
world.
It is an engaging piece of work. Madison eventually persuades the computer
to write poetry indistinguishable from his father's, thus revenging himself
for the old boy's bad behaviour during his childhood. One could name a few
novelists in the same spirit, whose stuff has clearly been written by
computers for years . . .
Happily, Jay Parini would not be among them. His historical novel The Last
Station won a small prize in America a couple of years ago and deserves to
succeed here as well. It tells the story in six different voices of Leo
Tolstoy's last days, as seen by the various factions warring round him - his
wife, daughter, doctor, secretary, chief disciple and hanger-on - and last,
but not least, as seen by Tolstoy himself.
Parini has used historical records whenever possible, but where there are
holes in the narrative he has cheerfully plugged the gap himself. The result
is a very plausible study of Tolstoy's terminal decline, beginning with
unhappy days at Yasnaya Polyana and continuing via his sudden departure from
home to his last illness and death at Astapovo station, surrounded by more
than a hundred journalists from around the world. The story is perfectly
well known, but Parini manages to bring it alive again, as if the reader is
there, rather than simply reading about it, which is a much harder trick
than it looks.
David Dabydeen's Disappearance is an allegory of England in decay, as seen
through the eyes of a young Guyanan working on an engineering project near
Hastings. The Guyanan's job is to shore up a cliff and so prevent a village
from crumbling into the sea. He makes friends with his landlady and learns
much from her about the failings and inadequacies of his adopted land.
It is all so very different from the mother country he had admired from
afar, as a youngster in the Caribbean. Even the sea wall is suspect, after
he has completed it. The author's message is uncompromising, but he writes
well, even lyrically. Guyanan himself, he has chosen to make his own home in
England, so perhaps the country is not quite as hopeless as he depicts it
here.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Books: Master of patriotic verse - This biography reinstates
the true value of Tennyson's poetry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENNYSON by Peter Levi Macmillan Pounds 20, 370 pages
SLIGHTLY more than 100 years ago, in October 1892, Tennyson had the biggest,
most public funeral of any English poet - a spectacular ceremonial in
Westminster Abbey with survivors of the Light Brigade lining the aisle. It
was an appropriate final tribute to a poet whose work had penetrated every
literate household in the land. What other poem has ever become so
inextricably interwoven with history and national pride as The Charge of the
Light Brigade?
When the Duke of Wellington died, Tennyson (who had been appointed Poet
Laureate two years earlier in 1850 on the death of Wordsworth) wrote: 'Bury
the Great Duke/ With an empire's lamentation,/ Let us bury the Great Duke/
To the noise of the mourning of a mighty nation . . .' It was an Ode in
which Tennyson gave robust patriotic expression to the Victorian moral
outlook in the famous couplet: 'Not once or twice in our fair island-story,/
The path of duty was the way to glory . . .'
Most of the time today we apprehend poetry, when we bother with it at all,
privately, almost secretly, through the eyes, listening to the sound of the
words only with the mind's ear. That is quite different from the way
Tennyson and his contemporaries listened to poetry. For them it was read
aloud regularly as part of general and parlour entertainment. Tennyson's
contemporary Browning perfected the notion of a poem as a histrionic
monologue. Even a poem-sequence stemming from a deep sense of personal loss
like In Memoriam was conceived in terms of public utterance.
Peter Levi, a poet himself, is highly sensitive to this aspect of Tennyson.
and reminds us of it when commenting on the poems. His biography of the poet
comes in the wake of several previous ones in recent years, such as Robert
Bernard Martin's Tennyson: The Unquiet Heart (1983) and Michael Thorn's
Tennyson (reviewed here last year). There have also been published during
the past decade three volumes of The Letters of Alfred Tennyson and in 1969
there was a truly complete edition of the poetry with copious biographical
notes on each poem edited by Christopher Ricks.
The basic facts, then, are not in dispute and Levi has no tremendous
revelations to unfold. His fresh light arises from his more erudite
discoveries - a copy of the Post Homerica of Quintus of Smyrna inscribed in
Greek (by Arthur Hallam he surmises) to Tennyson and providing him with the
source for the sequel to Oenone. We read once more of the poet's upbringing
as the fourth son of a drunken Lincolnshire rector, and of his attendance at
Louth Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was one of the
earliest members of the Apostles debating society.
He went down from the university with the Chancellor's Gold Medal for his
poem Timbuctoo but without a degree. He made his poetic debut in 1827 in the
slim volume, Poems by Two Brothers, a joint venture with his sibling
Charles. Then in 1830 came Poems, Chiefly Lyrical of which he was the sole
author. It was cruelly savaged by that notorious literary hatchet-man of the
period JW Croker - 'Croaker', Levi aptly calls him - in the Quarterly
Review. And as if this was not enough misery, a tragic blow followed when an
urgent letter from abroad informed Tennyson that his great Cambridge friend
Hallam (who was engaged to be married to his sister Emily) had died of
apoplexy in Vienna.
Levi discounts the view taken afterwards by Tennyson that, had his other
friends not supported him at this time of crisis with their praise of his
work, he would have given up poetry altogether. In the event he began In
Memoriam soon after his friend's death and he continued to draft poems
treating of the legends of Camelot. Levi dates the emergence of Tennyson as
a great poet to this period.
For those of us who belong to a generation whose taste for Tennyson was
systematically poisoned, first by reading TS Eliot's complaint that he
'ruminated' tediously, and then by the strictures of FR Leavis, the
deeply-felt responses in this book are a pleasingly corrective experience.
Levi rates the song 'Tears, idle tears' as a 'sad and perfect lyric'. That
was the very poem Leavis made the spearhead of his attack, contrasting it,
much to its disadvantage, with a more poised poem of regret by DH Lawrence.
But Levi discriminates too. He suggests that The Idylls of the King are
fatally flawed and most of them should be read quickly if at all. He feels
that the best part of The Princess is the Prologue, with its description of
an open day in summer in the grounds of Park House for the members of the
Maidstone Mechanics Institute. (The funfair scenes in Ken Russell's recent
and notorious production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Princess Ida were
ultimately derived from this instance of Tennyson's descriptive skill).
The plays Levi regards as more or less unreadable and certainly
unperformable; but he thinks that Maud (severely panned by George Eliot when
it first appeared) is 'a powerfully impressive poem'. He finds in it 'a very
full and fully sexual expression of love, which as a younger and unmarried
man Tennyson could not have written (there he differs from Tolstoy)'. It is
these bizarre throwaway comparisons that have such a salutary effect on the
reader; like the book as a whole, they send one straight back to the poems.

<TEXT>
ALIAS OLYMPIA by Eunice Lipton Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 12.95, 181 pages
FOR EVERY one art lover who knows her name, thousands can instantly
recognise the face and body of Victorine Meurent. She was the bold model
with the tight little frame and steady, daring gaze whose depiction in
Manet's Olympia and Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe revolutionised European nude
painting and outraged the 19th century art world. Contemporaries called
Meurent 'a female gorilla' and marched through the Salon with sticks and
umbrellas to attack her portrait. Now she is something of a feminist
heroine, the plucky naked girl who stares out of the canvas defying male
expectations of submission, the star of a sexy fete champetre who refuses
her part in the erotic script.
Who was the woman behind the image? Alias Olympia is subtitled 'a woman's
search for Manet's notorious model and her own desire', and began as Eunice
Lipton's attempt to find out. Lipton is a distinguished art historian, but
she soon discovered that history had buried Meurent as a typical model -
prostitute, alcoholic, loser - nicknamed 'the Shrimp'. Meurent is known to
have painted as well as modelled, but records, documents and interest in her
were negligible. There seemed no book to be written.
But Meurent became for Lipton an obsession, and scholarly research a
detective trail of blazing personal urgency. With wit and perception, Lipton
describes how she lived, breathed and dreamt Meurent, how lacklustre
archivists and Parisian alleys drove her to paranoia, how she came to see
the Parisian model born a hundred years before her as an alter ego who
shared her own problems with family, lovers, feminism and the art
establishment. Biography merges into autobiography, art history into a novel
as she creates her own idealised Meurent: a defiant lesbian artist who
whizzes about Paris, sells her paintings, drinks alone in bars, does her own
thing.
The result is a clever, unorthodox, enthralling book which combines
criticism and fiction in elegant symbiosis. Lipton's overarching theme is
the century-old treatment of women as objects in art and culture, and the
way this continues to condition how women see themselves. Here Meurent is
the breakthrough, 'resisting centuries of admonition to ingratiate herself',
consigned to (patriarchal) historical oblivion as punishment. Manet, who
after all created the radical image, gets no credit.
But you do not have to agree with Lipton to enjoy her story. Her format
allows a plethora of juicy digressions - sharp words on the pampered,
male-bonded lives of Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, for example, snap into
an analysis of why Renoir and Manet and Monet endlessly depicted one other
painting, but never drew the women artists working. Lipton has inspired
hunches, admissions of uncertain assumptions or dead-end routes which a
narrower scholarly work would lose. Most dazzling is her confidence to turn
the tables on herself and unearth research that shows how pathetically an
ageing, down-and-out Meurent traded on the Manet connection: a final joke in
which Meurent refuses to play her author's game as trenchantly as she
declined to satisfy the 19th century viewer.
Alias Olympia joins a small, impressive genre of post-modern criticism -
Richard Holmes' Footsteps, Cecily Mackworth's offbeat account of Freud in
Lucy's Nose last year - where the academic search is the story, where loose
ends are not tied up and uncertainties are accepted and bring life to the
narrative. It is cultural history at once learned, provocative, original and
unstuffy.

THIS IS a very pleasant, quiet book. It does not flash or thunder or try to
impose an ideologicai interpretation or go in for psychoanalytical theory.
In the hands of a professional scholar, it would probably have been three
times as long, burdened with five times as many footnotes and dragged behind
it a bibliography of 20 pages. The result would have been less readable and
probably less wise.
Sometimes the book skirts on thin ice when the author ventures into European
problems or Britain's economic development, but the ice never cracks. Apart
from a few weaknesses, it is an excellent book, in its quiet way seductively
readable and illuminating. Reading it is like eating a dish of well-buttered
brown bread, very nourishing, very sustaining, and very rare these days.
It is about John Ponsonby, who became Viscount Duncannon as a schoolboy and
succeeded as 4th Earl of Bessbrough a few years before he died in 1847. The
old Ponsonby estates were in Ireland, near Kilkenny, but the family rarely
went there for his mother was sister to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire,
(and a Spencer) and preferred their house at Roehampton.
Indeed, Duncannon was born into a very large whig network which took Charles
James Fox as its hero and leader: a part, therefore, of that vast whig
cousinage based principally on London but which also spent a lot of time
visiting each other. The core of his circle were the Cavendishs, Spencers,
Fitzwilliams, Lambtons, Howards and Lambs. Duncannon was related to most of
them.
It was a dissolute society enjoying the kind of sexual freedom which people
enjoy today but with its own taboos (you did not sleep with marriageable
girls of good family) and shibboleths (male infidelities were mere 'scrapes'
and openly gossiped about). The tone was set by the Devonshires: the Duke
brought up his bastards in the same nursery as his legitimate children. His
mistress, Lady Elizabeth Foster, was a close and loving friend of his wife.
Their more dangerous obsessions were drink and gambling - in the case of Fox
and the Duchess of Devonshire almost ruinously so. Duncannon's mother, whose
lover, Granville Leveson-Gower, was 12 years younger than herself, bore him
two girls but they were brought up apart from the family. She was almost as
extravagant as her sister, Georgiana. To put it mildly, the whig cousinage
was randy, extravagant, alcoholic and arrogant.
One of the fascinations of this book is to see how the scions of this group
adjusted to the vast political and social crises which ravaged Britain
between 1810-50. Their world was toppling and changing as fast as our own
has done this last few years. Duncannon, in his somewhat subfusc yet
debonair manner, was remarkably effective in guiding Britain through those
tempestuous times.
He made three great contributions to British political and social life. He
strengthened the office of Chief Whip; cleaned up the morass of antiquated
administration that was responsible for public and Royal buildings; and kept
Britain afloat and almost at peace in Ireland during the turmoil caused by
the Union.
His skills were a capacity for business, for the quick mastery of a complex
brief which is the hallmark of 'a man of business' in politics. As Chief
Whip he kept the whig opposition coherent during the long premiership of
Lord Liverpool, creating an umbrella that sheltered and kept together
old-fashioned whigs like Fitzwilliam and red-hot radicals like Alderman
Wood. His attention to detail was prodigious and he obviously possessed the
most important yet elusive of political qualities - charm. He was always
relaxed, cool and courteous, yet rock-like in basic principles derived from
Fox.
This biography is easy and enjoyable to read, not profound in itself but
driving one to brood on the complexities of politics and the art of
governing in a changing world where the future was hard to forecast. Some of
our cabinet could read it with advantage. Dorothy Howell-Thomas is to be
congratulated for resurrecting a remarkable man not only important in his
day but significant to posterity.

THANGLIENA: A LIFE OF T H LEWIN by John Whitehead Kiscadale Publications
Pounds 25, 437 pages
'WHO ARE these Victorians? By what mark are we to know them? What creed,
what doctrine, what institution was there among them which was not at some
time or other debated or assailed?'
THUS GM Young in his Victorian England: Portrait of an Age. We will find a
partial answer to the question in this excellent biography. But the answer
will be disconcerting. Much of the value of Thangliena lies in the fact that
the biographer, ostensibly narrating the life of a typical 'Guardian' in the
old Anglo-Indian mould, reveals the inner man.
Lewin was a Victorian imperialist; born in 1839, he died in 1916. He was
characteristic of his age and class in his energy, range of interests and
accomplishments, his undoubted devotion to the Lushai Hill Tracts tribesmen
he first vanquished and then ruled paternally. But Lewin was consumed
nevertheless by hatred of 'this beastly country', and burdened with longing
for an English arcadia where he could gain peace of mind.
Lewin did not find that peace; even in retirement he was reduced to
depressed resignation, solace in music and tobacco. Unfeeling parents,
unhappy schooldays, and the horrors of the Mutiny through which he fought
aged 18, may have shaped his temperament into a pattern whereby the surface
was all action and decision, the background dark and obscure. Such a
psychological evolution was not uncommon with imperialists, who devoted much
of their lives to unselfish service yet could never find true fulfilment
therein. These Victorians, who brought a kind of law and order to the world
 -even if a punitive expedition always remained to back them up - were
conscious to a degree which perhaps we fail to appreciate today that 'the
day's work', as Kipling expressed it, begged more questions than it settled.
James Abbott amongst the Hazara, Robert Sandeman amidst his Baluchis, faced
the problem which confronted Lewin on the distant frontier between Assam and
Burma, one which John Whitehead describes so well. He narrates Lewin's
experience in the 1860s and 1870s of nearly a decade of endeavour in a
destructive climate. Did the Lushai and Chin Hill tribesman accept
'pacification'? Up to a point. Did these tribes want schools and telegraph?
Yes, very much up to a point. Was Lewin's zealous work interpreting and
transcribing their dialects appreciated? Yes, and it is here that we can see
why these men of the wild green earth called Lewin 'Thangliena', the
'Lushai's first white friend'.
Lewin was so honoured - much as a tribe in Iraq called itself the Beit
Mackenzie, 'Mackenzie's people', in memory of some otherwise forgotten son
of empire - not because he subdued, ruled and succoured them, but because he
identified himself with them, living as a man amongst men rather than as a
ruler amongst ruled. He did so in the hope of answering that nagging
Victorian question: for what purpose am I here, in wilderness or by the
Surrey pine to which, his health broken, he rather prematurely retired.
Answer came there not; doubts multiplied, about religion ,about women about
himself.
Yet Lewin left his mark, and in an imperial context after all. The Lushai
and Chin tribes were courageous guerrilla warriors in the second world war,
and succumbed to no Japanese lures. One hopes that, in some Victorian
nirvana, Lewin had his question answered at last.

COLLISION OF EMPIRES: BRITAIN INTHREE WORLD WARS 1793-1945
by AD  Harvey Hambledon Press Pounds 45, 784 pages
COLLISION of Empires is not one book but three. Its sections - on the wars
against revolutionary and Napoleonic France, and the First and the Second
World Wars - are separate works. They all just happen to be about long wars
since 1793 in which Britain was involved.
The book lacks two of the characteristics necessary for a contemporary
historical bestseller: copious illustrations and a price under Pounds 25.
But it has the rest. It is very long, very readable, very detailed, crammed
with footnotes evidencing colossal research; and it purports to address a
'big question': how did Britain's experience of the three wars compare?
Mr Harvey barely begins to answer that question, but his lucidity and
erudition are not to be gainsaid. As an account of the inter-connections
between politics, diplomacy and military strategy in three European wars
since 1793, his book is masterly, full of insight and sympathy. The minutiae
 -pages, for instance, on the origins of the Machine Gun Corps and why Sir
John French was not sacked earlier as commander of the British Expeditionary
Force - can be oppressive, but Harvey's grasp of constitutions, dynasties,
strategy, technology, national accounts, and more besides, is remarkable,
dazzling professional and bedtime readers alike.
Harvey has an eye for the vivid quotation and cutting aside. After a survey
of the chronic incompetence of pre-1914 Habsburg administration, he remarks,
'only an Austrian archduke could have fallen victim to a second
assassination attempt in one day.' Tannenberg, Ypres, Verdun, Caporetto, the
Somme, 'toll the passing of an age that was unprepared for its own demise
and died hard.' Stalingrad was 'only the nemesis of a consistently hubristic
style of campaigning.'
The hubris, and the insulation of military and political elites from the
horrors of all three wars, are deftly intertwined with passages on the
technicalities of tanks, gas, average earnings and high-definition radar.
'Generally,' Harvey opens one chapter, 'the military favoured new or
improved ways of killing people.' Like the fusilier who wrote back from the
trenches of the Somme, 'If hell is any worse I would not like to go to it';
or the First World War air squadrons in which the mention of casualties or
enquiries about colleagues missing at mealtimes were forbidden; or the
hundreds of German youths whose names are inscribed on gravestones in
Bergfriedhof, Heidelberg, 'the gazetteer of Nazi advance, retirement and
collapse.'
But when it comes to the 'big question', one looks in vain for an answer.
There is no systematic comparison of the three wars, even by way of
conclusion. Indeed, it is not clear why the war against revolutionary and
Napoleonic France is included at all. A three-page introduction says it is
on the grounds that 'in a sense, at least as regards Britain, it belongs to
the era of 20th-century warfare', while 'the assumptions behind the decision
for war in 1914 and 1939 will be more clearly understood if the earlier war
is taken into account.'
In a sense, yes; in many others, no. As for the assumptions, the evolution
of post-unification Germany, the Irish question, and the exigencies of
late-Victorian and Edwardian imperialism would add more clarity to the
decision for war in 1914 than pages on George III as a national symbol, or
paper roubles in circulation in the 1790s. For a book ostensibly about
empires, there is remarkably little about empire, either at the theoretical
level or by way of description of the imperial dimensions to the three
conflicts under examination.
Much of the book is not even loosely related to the theme of Britain in
three world wars. Calling them 'parallel cases' and suggesting that they
might give us a 'clearer idea' of British motivation does little to make
relevant lengthy sections on why Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and the US
did or did not declare war in 1914. Ditto the fascinating discussion of the
varieties of fascism, and of 'isolated ideologues' of similar ilk in Belgium
and France. 'Aspects of the three wars which tickle the author's fancy'
would be a more apt sub-title.
Only in the final paragraph is there a hint of an over-view, when Harvey
half-heartedly invokes a cycle from 'national wars fought without national
leadership, as in 1793-1815' to 'wars fought by national leaders determined
to survive in their bunkers while the nation as such perishes in the nuclear
holocaust outside.' But who was 'the nation' in 1793, and how was it able to
go to war for 22 years without its 'national leaders'? True, Harvey is
somewhat confused about the identity of the leaders. At one point William
Pitt is 'a royal servant surviving by royal favour'; later he is 'no royal
stooge' and only 'ostensibly' George III's servant. But whether George III,
Pitt or Wellington were at the helm, it would be intriguing to know how the
French wars are supposed to have been fought without them.
To be fair, Harvey gives a response to such carping in the concluding
sentence. 'We will know better,' he informs us, 'where we are going when we
have got there, and a book like this one cannot be more than an attempt at
an interim report.' If the interim report takes 756 pages, keep a retirement
or two free for the final solution.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: New trust offers 8.5% yield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW investment trust offering a yield of 8.5 per cent will be launched
later this month by Grahams Rintoul, a small fund management group. The High
Income trust will invest in convertible stocks - fixed-interest securities
which can be converted into ordinary shares.
The theory behind convertible investing is that the high yield gives a
decent income and, if share prices rise sharply, there is a chance of extra
profit by exercising the conversion option.
The theory has not worked too well in recent years, though. The average
convertible unit trust rose just 19.4 per cent (offer-to-bid with income
re-invested) over the five years to March 1, according to Finstat.
High Income's manager, Nick Coombes, says that unit trusts specialising in
the area can be hit by redemptions, which require them to sell their most
liquid - and often their most attractive - stocks. Furthermore, many of the
convertibles issued in the mid-1980s were by companies on acquisition
sprees; many deals turned sour late in the decade and the early 1990s.
Coombes says there are still plenty of good stocks available in the market,
such as Tarmac, Amec, Rank, BAe, BICC and Hanson. His main aim is to ensure
that the trust can continue to make its dividend payments, which will be
paid quarterly. If that is achieved, he says, the capital will look after
itself.
The trust's capital structure is that 70 per cent will be in ordinary shares
with the rest in zero dividend preference shares, which will be on a
redemption yield of 8.5 per cent. The build-up of the zero's value will be
charged against the trust's income account, which has tax advantages. But,
as with other split capital trusts, if the manager fails to perform, the
demands of the zero will eat into the value of the ordinary shares.
The chairman of the trust will be John Short, the former manager of BZW
Convertible trust, the only other investment trust in this field. It is top
of the UK General sector over three years, with a rise of 64.1 per cent, and
its shares stand at a premium to asset value. High Income trust will have a
restricted six-year life, which should limit the danger that the shares will
fall to a discount.
Under the present rules, the trust does not qualify for personal equity plan
status. So, income-seeking investors might consider it as an add-on to a
Pep, such as those on offer from Cazenove, Fidelity, Foreign &amp; Colonial or
M&amp;G.
The minimum investment will be Pounds 1,000; annual management charge will
be 0.8 per cent; and issue expenses will be no more than 4 per cent. The
broker is the London-based Greig Middleton. The launch is scheduled for
March 25, so details may alter if there is a change in economic and
financial conditions before then.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Medical insurers curb premium rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH insurers have begun to lance the boil of medical cost-inflation which
has bedevilled the industry. The result is a lower rate of increase in
premiums this year - an encouraging sign after a period when a combination
of factors seemed to be pushing private health insurance out of the reach of
many people.
Insurers reassess their premiums twice a year, although customers pay only
once. The British United Provident Association (Bupa), the largest medical
insurer, announced increases of 14.7 per cent for the year for individual
subscribers, but those renewing company schemes will see an increase of only
7.2 per cent. These figures followed increases the previous year of 23 per
cent.
Norwich Union Healthcare has increased its premiums by 10 per cent for the
year, a figure equalled, on average, by Western Provident Association. This
figure is higher for the elderly - pensioners on WPA health insurance
schemes which qualify for tax relief face an increase of 25 per cent this
year, following a 36 per cent rise last year.
But these rises are only averages. On some policies, insurers have frozen
premiums, or even decreased them.
Private Patients Plan has announced that premiums will drop by 5 per cent in
July. When combined with the increase announced earlier in the year, that
means premiums for around 250,000 policy-holders, will reduce or stay the
same.
Reductions will fall mostly on budget plans - for example, a family headed
by a 50-year-old would see a reduction in monthly premiums from Pounds 41.40
to Pounds 38.20.
What lies behind the increases? Lawrence Hager, of Noble Lowndes, identifies
several factors which together cause the trend to higher premiums. These
include:
Medical inflation - which was highlighted last year when the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission investigated consultants' prices.
Technology.
Cost-shifting from the public sector to the private.
Utilisation - the amount of times each policyholder makes a claim.
Anti-selection - the phenomenon by which those who realise that they are
likely to need private medical treatment are more likely to take out the
insurance.
In the US last year, these combined to force an increase of 20.5 per cent
for 1993.
In the UK, medical inflation - as measured by the cost of each claim to the
companies - had been allowed to get out of control, but the insurers now
seem to be putting a lid on it. According to Arthur Large, chief executive
of Bupa, costs per claim increased by only 2.2 per cent last year, following
7 per cent in 1991. This is barely ahead of the rate of inflation.
But rising premiums encourage further anti-selection (as those who consider
themselves fit decide that insurance is no longer worth the expense), and
also increase utilisation of the service.
According to Large, Bupa's policy-holders claimed 7 per cent more often last
year than they did the year before. But members of corporate schemes - less
prone to anti-selection - actually claimed on their insurance 1.7 per cent
less than in the year before, and Bupa's company premiums were not raised at
the beginning of this year.
So, the years of cost-inflation may bring consumers some benefits. Insurers
have been forced to offer a wider range of products, allowing consumers to
avoid paying for cover for ailments which would be just as well treated by
the NHS.
WPA, for instance, now has 15 different products with different levels of
cover. A family headed by a 50-year-old could pay as much as Pounds 1,442.90
a year, or as little as Pounds 369, for its insurance.
According to Julian Stainton, of WPA, the latter only covers 'quality of
life' ailments (such as varicose veins), for which NHS waiting lists are
justifiably longest, and does not cover acute illnesses, for which the NHS
is usually speedy.
Watch out for further changes to premium structures. Medical insurance has
grown much more expensive, but at last the insurers have been forced to keep
an eye on what doctors are spending and to address the needs of the
consumer.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Top annuity rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO feel they need not worry about inflation now it has fallen to 1.7
per cent should take a look at the annuity table. All the annuities are
'compulsory purchase' - the kind bought with a pension fund on retirement.
You can buy an annuity which grows by 3 per cent annually, or one which
increases by the rise in the retail price index each year. Note that the
amounts paid out initially for the 3 per cent annuity are much higher than
for the RPI-linked annuity. That means actuaries expect average inflation to
be considerably higher than 3 per cent over the lifetime of their
annuitants.
RNPF Nurses, which appears in several lists, offers annuities only to
members of the medical professions. All figures were supplied by The Annuity
Bureau, 11-12 Hanover Square, London, W1R 9HD, tel. 071-495 1495.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wind-up worry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER SELLING a business in 1970, my wife and I were left with a company
which had previously run the business. Since that time, it has been
reorganised by the tax authorities as an investment company - my wife and I
being the sole shareholders.
In the beginning, the value of the investments held amounted to very little,
but this has grown gradually over the years to Pounds 20,000. There are no
debts and no activity other than the payment of a few hundred pounds for
secretarial services to my wife. But accounting charges amount to around
Pounds 400 per year, which seems a waste of money.
Because of our age - we are both 70- plus - we wish to liquidate the company
but have been quoted Pounds 2,000-plus for this. What should we do?
It might be preferable to take a different course from formal winding-up:
namely, to have the company struck off the register of companies as having
ceased to trade. Briefly, you would pay off any creditors and all taxes and
distribute the assets as dividend. You then prepare a balance sheet, which
need not be audited if the company has not traded since the last accounting
date.
The directors should pass a resolution to take personal responsibility for
any unquantified liabilities (accountancy fees) plus a resolution that the
company has ceased to trade, is no longer required, and that the companies'
registrar be asked to strike it off the register. Signed copies of the
resolutions and balance sheet are then sent to the registrar with a note of
the company's tax office and reference number.
If the inspector of taxes responds to the registrar's enquiry and confirms
that all tax liabilities have been settled, the registrar will normally
proceed to strike off the company. This will involve considerably less cost
than a winding-up.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

my wife or myself suffered serious injuries.
My insurance company has paid me for the car but the other side, although
admitting the horse was responsible, is refusing to meet such additional
direct costs as hospital and hotel accommodation.
Your remedy here would lie in sueing the owner of the horse for the loss
which you have incurred and which the insurers are not prepared to meet.
This might present difficulties if the horse was not being ridden and had
escaped from private land; but section 8 of the Animals Act 1971 makes it
possible to establish negligence in keeping the horse in such circumstances
that it was able to get into the road in the way in which it did. You would
be wise to consult a solicitor.

soon as possible.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: NS to get an arbiter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS

<TEXT>
A NEW recruit is to join the ranks of ombudsmen and arbitrators handling
complaints about financial services. From April 1, the newcomer - styled an
'independent adjudicator' - will determine disputes between the department
for National Savings and its investors.
The name of the adjudicator - picked from a field of 50 legally-qualified
applicants - will be announced soon by the Treasury. The job is part-time
and the appointee will take over the task from the registrar of friendly
societies.
Investors might wonder how an adjudicator appointed, paid-for and provided
with office space by National Savings' overlord, the Treasury, can be
described as independent. But although NS has around 30m investors, very few
of those involved in disputes are likely to come into contact with the
adjudicator - or even to learn that such an official exists.
Unlike the banks, most of which display posters or leaflets about their
ombudsman, NS has no plans to make any information about the adjudicator
available in post offices. And, apparently, it intends not to reveal the
possibility of adjudication until very late in a dispute.
An NS spokesman said this week that if a dispute reached an impasse after
'protracted correspondence,' the department would then tell the investor the
matter could be referred to the adjudicator.
The annual report of the registrar of friendly societies shows that in the
year to September 1992, he dealt with 18 NS disputes: 10 over NS savings
bank deposits; six over savings certificates; and two over stocks, bonds or
premium bonds. Third-party title disputes were the largest category,
accounting for 11 cases, followed by claims for additional interest (three
cases).

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Mips and Fips, options for Lamont to
ponder - Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLORS of the exchequer have created a variety of new investment
vehicles in recent years, such as personal equity plans (Peps) and
tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas), while abolishing a number of
low-yielding taxes - such as the excise duty on matches and mechanical
lighters.
Will chancellor Norman Lamont's March 16 Budget follow that pattern? If so,
as a private investor I hope he will introduce two new investment vehicles -
Mips and Fips - to take the place of the business expansion scheme (BES)
which ends on December 31.
Given the prime minister's recent statements on the need to encourage
manufacturing industries, then Mips (manufacturing investment plans) might
have some appeal. Investors would receive tax relief on their investment in
newly-issued shares in start-up and existing small businesses which used the
funds to develop or expand their manufacturing capabilities.
Mips would be restricted to companies with assets less than, say, Pounds
10m. Subsidiaries, or companies associated with major companies, would not
be eligible. The tax relief terms could be somewhat similar to those that
apply to BES investors. There would be no limit on the total amount each
company could raise by this method of funding.
Fips (film investment plans) also would provide BES-style tax relief for
investors who put money into encouraging and expanding the British movie
industry. Each production, regardless of the size of its budget, would be
open to private investors. Ideally, this would encourage production of more
films with mass appeal (as opposed to art house movies, which might receive
subsidies from the new national lottery). With luck, such films would lead
not only to a steady stream of income from foreign sales but also act as
world-wide promoters of British talent. Films with excessive violence would
not qualify for Fips.
The ideal tax for abolition in the Budget is stamp duty on share
transactions. If the chancellor feels he cannot get rid of this iniquitous
tax completely, then at least it should be abolished for private investors,
leaving institutions to continue paying it.
Stamp duty on house purchases could also be abolished. If this was
accompanied by an announcement that mortgage interest tax relief was being
phased out over, say, the next 10 years, then this would help to lubricate
the housing market and, in the long term, save the government huge sums of
money. It could also help shares in house-building companies.
There has been much press comment about the government's need to borrow yet
more money to fund its spending plans; and it has been suggested that the
rules for Peps should be amended to allow gilts to qualify for inclusion.
But I would much prefer that Peps were abolished. As well as an increase in
capital gains tax allowances, private investors should be given roll-over
relief instead.
Already, some forms of institutional investment benefit effectively from
such relief; unit and investment trusts pay no CGT when share-holdings are
bought and sold. The individual taxpayer becomes liable for such tax when
the units or investment trust shares are cashed in. A private investor
should be able to benefit personally from roll-over relief on his individual
share transactions. So long as the proceeds from a sale are used to fund
another investment (shares or gilts), then no tax should be levied.
The chancellor should also make it much easier for people to organise their
own personal pension schemes without the need for fund managers and
trustees. They should be allowed to set aside part of their income for
pension purposes and invest it how they wish: if they lose it all, hard
luck] But at least they would have direct control over their own destiny
(plus the tax advantages).
Fund managers in Britain have control over an uncomfortably large proportion
of companies and industry. The time is long overdue to encourage and promote
much more direct investment by private individuals - particularly as they
are more likely to complain loudly in cases of pathetic management than some
institutions.
There are a number of companies that may suffer from the Budget. It has been
suggested that the chancellor could extend VAT to domestic fuel and power -
perhaps at 5 per cent initially - in order to help fund the government's
deficit and demonstrate a 'green' policy. If that happens, shares in all
utility companies could be hit.
Fortunately, I hold only a modest number in Southern Electric (so I can
complain at the next annual general meeting about the poor power supply to
my home). But no such levy should be applied to Scottish Hydro Electric,
which provides the 'cleanest' power in the UK.
In his Budget last year, the chancellor increased tax on leaded petrol at a
higher rate than unleaded, and said this continued the government's
'long-standing and successful policy' of encouraging people to use unleaded
fuel. I expect he will widen the gap even more this year.
The Inland Revenue has completed a review of company car tax and the
chancellor is expected to announce further increases in this area. Suppliers
of expensive vehicles may suffer as these could well attract higher tax,
while the benefit of company car insurance could be affected similarly.
Whatever the chancellor announces, I hope it is accompanied by a statement
showing how the costs of government and administration are being reduced.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Credit card bills blunder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE with a National Westminster Bank Worldwide Fund for Nature Visa
affinity credit card should handle their statements from the start of the
year with extreme caution - and they would do well to check the figures
carefully.
NatWest admitted last week that thousands of these cardholders had been
overcharged because their payments had been sent to other people's accounts
by mistake.
The funds were misdirected for the first payment period after the 15,000 WWF
accounts were converted into ordinary Visa accounts - in the period January
1-26 this year.
The bank had identified the error by the end of the month and changed its
systems so payments after that time were correctly credited. But it chose
only to make reimbursements to customers who contacted it to complain that
their payments were not shown - which it said amounted to 'a significant
number' of complaints.
A senior manager in its credit card services unit decided that it was not
necessary to contact anybody else who was affected, although it would have
been possible to identify these cardholders.
Only a few days ago, when a customer complained to a more senior bank
official, did NatWest decide to contact every customer with a WWF account
and adjust their statements.
The bank says it has now brought in a team to identify all those cardholders
who may have been affected and to arrange reimbursements and some possible
additional compensation. They can all expect to receive letters of apology
in the next few days.
Any WWF customers who made payments which were not credited to their
accounts will see that money restored and will have the additional interest
charges made against them removed. The bank said it was also considering
offering some extra reward.
Any other Visa customers with statements showing payments from others
misdirected to their accounts will see the money removed, but will not be
expected to pay the additional interest they owe.
NatWest has apologised for the errors and said that no customers would be
left out of pocket as a result of the mistake. The bank has launched an
internal inquiry to see whether disciplinary action is called for, and to
prevent such incidents happening again.
NatWest said the error occurred after it decided to withdraw the WWF
affinity card in late December last year. A 'human error' when converting
them into ordinary Visa accounts meant that some went to other people's
accounts with the same identification numbers.
However, the issue demonstrates how important it is for all bank customers
to check their statements meticulously. Only last August, NatWest decided to
write to 1m credit card holders after discovering statement errors following
a change in computer software.
The Consumers' Association said last week that the incident was just the
latest instance of the lack of adequate checking carried out by banks on
their customers' transactions.
A survey it carried out last year showed that one in seven current account
holders with UK banks had found inaccuracies in their statements.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Lump sums, the case for caution -
Living with redundancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOLS WINNERS are usually advised to put their winnings in the bank and take
a holiday before doing anything with their money.
If you have been made redundant you may feel like anything but a pools
winner - but the advice still applies: do not do rush into anything with
your redundancy lump sum.
What you finally do depends on your financial circumstances, but it is not a
good idea to tie up money when facing an uncertain future.
David Harris, of Chantry Financial Services, fee-based advisers, says: 'For
the first one to three months you should do nothing from an investment point
of view until you are in a situation to make long-term plans.'
Put the money in an instant access building society account in preference to
a bank account, since interest rates are likely to be higher. Postal
accounts, which give reasonable access, pay some of the highest interest
because of their low overheads. If your spouse is a non-taxpayer, depositing
the money in their name will reduce the overall tax burden.
Even if your redundancy pay-off is sizeable, many will find it is
insufficient to live off for the rest of their lives. It is therefore
essential to draw up a personal budget in order to make financial planning
easier. Write down all sources of income and expenditure for the next six
months, including income from equity investments and financial commitments
such as a mortgage. Do not forget direct debits.
You must also contact creditors to tell them that you have been made
redundant: even if you do not need their goodwill immediately, you may need
it eventually, and unless they know of your changed financial circumstances
they cannot make allowances for them.
Although it is unwise to make financial investments immediately, do not
ignore essential insurance. If you no longer have life or health insurance
cover because these had been provided by your employer you should consider
taking on a new policy, especially if you have children.
Some insurance companies will agree to continue health cover for an
individual who had been in a company scheme without requiring a new medical
examination. This will have to be arranged soon after leaving the company.
It is also important to maintain existing pension levels. If you had a
company scheme, you could leave the pension with the company, or transfer it
to a personal scheme or your new employer's company scheme if you find
employment. This subject will be addressed in a later article.
You should cut unnecessary expenditure by using your lump sum to pay off
expensive debts, such as credit card bills. Most cards charge an annual
percentage rate of between 21 and 26 per cent. If you need to borrow, it may
be cheaper to arrange a personal loan with your bank.
If your redundancy pay was not substantial it would be unwise to use all of
it to pay off debts, since you will need money to live on. It is therefore
important to get financial advice. 'Tied' agents, who can only sell the
products of one company, should be avoided in favour of an independent
financial adviser, preferably one who charges fees.
Most IFAs are remunerated by commission from insurance and other companies
to encourage them to recommend their products. This cost is borne by the
consumer through high 'front-end' charges.' Although many
commission-charging advisers are scrupulous about their recommendations,
fee-based advisers - who charge for advice directly - do not face the same
potential conflict of interest when giving advice.
The adviser should be registered under the Financial Services Act - check by
telephoning the Securities and Investments Board's central register on
071-929-3652.
If you have share options in a save-as-you-earn share option scheme operated
by your former employer, check the scheme rules. Most company schemes allow
an employee who is made redundant to exercise their share options within six
months of leaving the company, regardless of the original option date.
The disadvantage for those who leave a scheme early is that they lose the
bonus payable towards the end of the contract. This increases the final
interest payment and therefore the amount available to buy shares.
The alternative, if you can afford it, is to continue the scheme until it
ends and take out the cash.
If your redundancy payoff is small and you need access to cash, you should
start by liquidating those investments with the smallest penalties. Taking
out the cash saved in the share option scheme is one option, as is selling
shares, but watch for any potential capital gains tax liability.
Raiding a Tessa is another solution - you simply pay tax on the interest
instead of receiving it gross at the end of its five year period.
You can make savings by stopping a unit trust or investment trust savings
scheme; this is penalty-free and the scheme can be revived once you have a
new job.
Long-term investments you should avoid cashing-in include endowments and
whole-of-life or similar plans because the return for early surrender is so
low. 'You are stuck with the policy anyway and you will not be able to stop
premiums without losing money,' says Peter Smith, of financial advisers Hill
Martin. If you have no choice, check the surrender value with the insurance
company and compare it with what you would get by selling the policy to a
marketmaker or at auction.
If you find it difficult to keep up your mortgage payments, see if your
lender is prepared to suspend capital repayments or to defer interest if the
mortgage is on a repayment basis. Remember that these interest payments will
mount up. The lender might also be prepared to extend the term of the loan,
thereby reducing your monthly outlay.
In last week's article, the figure for unemployment benefit payable for a
dependent adult is Pounds 26.60, not Pounds 25.55, according to the DSS.
Unemployment benefit is not affected by statutory redundancy pay.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Saints aims for best of both worlds
 -Investment Trusts / Philip Coggan reports on Scottish American, which
offers both income and an international flavour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVESTOR who wants an international portfolio often has to sacrifice
income. But Scottish American Investment Company - or Saints, as it prefers
to be called - pays quarterly dividends and offers a yield of 4 per cent,
barely below the present return on the UK market.
The trust was founded in 1873 to invest in US railway bonds. At the time,
they were offering 3 per cent when gilts were returning just 2 per cent.
The American flavour lasted until the early 1980s, when the trust had 30 per
cent of its assets in the region, but the holding has fallen to 11.5 per
cent. That is one reason the trust prefers the name Saints to its official
title.
Like many other Scottish trust groups, it was managed by a firm of Edinburgh
lawyers which needed a vehicle to manage its clients' money. It was not
until 1970 that a separate management company, Stewart Fund Managers, was
established. This, in in turn, merged with Ivory &amp; Company in 1985 to become
Stewart Ivory.
The present manager is Teddy Tulloch, who joined the firm in 1972 and has
been looking after Saints since 1985. He is responsible for asset
allocation, but stocks are selected by specialist regional teams.
Outside the UK, the trust concentrates on growth-oriented stocks, looking
for those with high returns on equity, a strong balance sheet and a positive
cash flow. Its UK portfolio has to pay the dividends, so the managers aim
for a yield on this portion of around 25 per cent above that on the
All-Share index.
The 10 largest investments at December 31 were: Davis Service, Independent
Insurance, British Telecommunications, Bowater, Christian Salvesen, British
Gas, Shell, Powell Duffryn, Boots, and Value &amp; Income Trust.
Many trusts gear up (borrow to invest in shares) on the ground that returns
from equities beat fixed-interest returns in the long run. But the managers
of Saints have set themselves a challenging task. Its main form of borrowing
is an issue of unsecured loan stock, which rises in line with the FT-A
All-Share index. The argument is that a manager ought to be able to beat the
All-Share - otherwise, why employ him?
Nevertheless, it means that if the manager does have a bad year investing
the gross assets, the effect on the net assets will be doubly bad since the
indexed stock (worth Pounds 67.6m at the end of 1992) will have risen in
value. Stewart Ivory can take some steps to reduce this risk by hedging in
the futures market.
As the graph shows, the trust has kept pace with the All-Share only over the
past 10 years. It had two bad periods - one in the early 1980s, when it was
stuck with too many unquoted oil stocks; and another late in 1989, when it
was over-exposed to small companies.
Over the past two years, however, the record has improved. Although the
trust is 14th out of 19 in the international general sector over seven
years, with a return of 142.9 per cent, it is eighth out of 21 over two
years. (Figures from Finstat are mid-market to mid-market, with income
re-invested over the period to March 1).
Allowing for the UK gearing of 20 per cent, the trust's net exposure to UK
equities was around 46.7 per cent at end-1992, with other assets split
between North America (11.5 per cent), continental Europe (8.1), Japan
(5.6), Pacific Rim (8.1), unquoted (6.7), fixed interest (10.3) and others
(3.0).
The trust has had some success in attracting individual investors (who now
own around half) and the discount has narrowed to 13 per cent, compared with
22 per cent at end-1987. The annual report of the company is one of the best
in the investment trust field, with clear breakdowns of the portfolio by
sector and stocks.
Key facts. According to NatWest Securities Limited, the net assets per share
on March 10 were 168p, putting the shares, at 145p, on a discount of 13.7
per cent. The net assets of the trust were around Pounds 375m on that basis,
and the gross assets around Pounds 450m. The market capitalisation was
Pounds 325m and the yield 4 per cent. The manager's annual fee is 0.25 per
cent of shareholders' funds, plus 3.5 per cent of total income less
borrowing costs.
Board. All the directors are independent of the managers. Jack Shaw, the
chairman, is deputy governor of the Bank of Scotland. Other directors are:
William Berry, senior partner of legal firm of Murray, Beith and Murray; Sir
James Mellon, chairman of Scottish Homes; Dr Janet Morgan, an author and
director of WH Smith; and Barry Sealey, director of Scottish Equitable.
Savings scheme and PEP details. The minimum investment in the savings scheme
is Pounds 25 a month, or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. There is an initial
charge of Pounds 10 plus VAT, which is deducted from the first payment.
The trust is fully Pepable; there is an annual charge of Pounds 25 plus VAT.
For those who buy the trust through an independent financial adviser, there
might be a charge of 3 per cent plus VAT. This is a change from Saints'
previous policy when investors had to pay commission even if they did not
consult an adviser. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,800 for a lump sum,
or Pounds 150 a month.

   THE YIELDS on permanent interest bearing shares
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
which are building society shares issued to raise capital for the society -
have been steadily falling as their prices rise.
In our last table, which showed prices at midday January 21, the gross yield
on Britannia Pibs, for example, was 11.35 per cent; that had fallen to 10.86
per cent by midday on Thursday. The price rose from 114.50p to 119.75p over
the same period.
The fall in interest rates has been favourable to Pibs prices and although
yields have fallen, they are still high compared with returns from equities
or deposit accounts. This helps account for the increasing popularity of
Pibs with private investors looking for income, but it is also a reflection
of the risk they carry.
Pibs pay a fixed income twice a year net of basic rate tax. Any gains on the
sale of the shares are exempt from capital gains tax.
They are deeply subordinated - which means that were the society to
collapse, Pibs holders would be behind all other creditors in the queue for
repayment.
If there is another cut in interest rates, prices can be expected to
increase further but once interest rates turn upwards, prices will fall.
Since Pibs are irredeemable shares the building society is under no
obligation to repay the principal, so the original investment can only be
regained by selling the shares. Falls in price therefore threaten the Pibs
holder's capital although the income remains fixed in perpetuity, subject to
the society's ability to maintain payments.

FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: German bourse chief executive to
step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rudiger von Rosen, one of the most prominent figures in the campaign to
strengthen Germany's financial markets in recent years, is to step down as
chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, the single German stock exchange
which came into being at the beginning of the year.
The move came as a surprise in Frankfurt as it was only recently that Mr von
Rosen had his contract as chief executive renewed until the end of 1994.
He is to be replaced by Mr Werner Seifert, a Swiss businessman who is main
board director of Swiss Re responsible for the company's primary insurance
activities.
Mr von Rosen will retain his job as chief executive until the end of July
when Mr Seifert, 44, will take over. The official statement said that Mr von
Rosen would stay on as an ordinary member of the managing board but
Frankfurt financiers said that this was unlikely.
Mr von Rosen, 49, was not available for comment yesterday. He is a former
head of press relations at the Bundesbank and personal assistant to Mr Karl
Otto Pohl, former president of the German central bank.
He is one of the more outspoken figures on the German financial scene. He
left the Bundesbank in 1986 to take up a position as managing director of
the Frankfurt stock exchange, the largest in Germany.
He was a key figure in the campaign which led ultimately to the creation of
the Deutsche Borse, a holding structure which brings Germany's eight
regional stock-exchanges partially under one roof.

NET profits at ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, rose by nearly 10
per cent in 1992 with buoyant results from North America helping to
compensate for a relatively sluggish performance at home and in Europe.
The bank said net profit climbed by 9.6 per cent to Fl 1.68bn (Dollars
908m), while profit per share rose by a more moderate 5.6 per cent to Fl
5.51. The dividend is being held at Fl 2.90.
'Given the fact that 1992 was not an easy year in several countries, the
result is satisfactory,' said Mr Robert Hazelhoff, ABN Amro's chairman.
Total revenue at the bank was up 8.5 per cent at Fl 12.28bn, while total
costs saw the same percentage increase to Fl 8.32bn, producing an 8.5 per
cent gain in gross profits to Fl 3.97bn.
ABN Amro attributed the high rate of growth in costs to the acquisitions
last year of Talman Home Federal Savings of Illinois, the London-based
European operations of stockbrokers Hoare Govett, and CM Capital Markets of
Spain.
The first-time consolidation of Talman helped double ABN Amro's gross
profits in North America to Fl 811m. Without Talman, results would have
risen by nearly 68 per cent. Mr Hazelhoff said the emerging recovery in the
US had led to a rise in demand for credit from small and medium-sized
businesses.
Lending in the US rose by 38.9 per cent, compared with just 3.7 per cent in
Europe and 7.2 per cent in the Netherlands.
At home, gross results fell by 3.4 per cent to Fl 2.5bn from Fl 2.59bn in
1991. The previous year's figures had been flattered by nearly Fl 200m in
book profits from the divestment of two intermediary companies.

FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu forecasts Y20bn loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer maker and number two in the world
rankings, expects to post a pre-tax loss this year, the first since the
group was listed on the Tokyo stock exchange in 1949.
Fujitsu, which owns ICL, the UK computer company, yesterday said the
unexpected length of Japan's economic slowdown would leave the group with a
pre-tax loss on a consolidated basis of Y20bn (Dollars 159.2m) for the year
ending March, 1993. This reverses an earlier Fujitsu forecast of a Y30bn
profit.
The Japanese computer group, which emulated and strove to surpass IBM, the
US computer group, will end up following its fiercest rival into the red.
Fujitsu says it will pay a final dividend of Y3 a share and not the Y5
forecast. Consolidated revenues, which were forecast in October to be
Y3,600bn would instead be Y150bn less at Y3,400bn. However, ICL was expected
to make a profit, Fujitsu said.
Fujitsu said that the profit revision comes as a result of the sharp fall in
demand for computers and in profit margins from computers. While markets
worldwide have been affected by the slump in corporate investment, the
Japanese computer market, in particular, has been hit by cuts in capital
investment by corporations and financial institutions.
While computer companies normally expect a burst of demand from customers
just before the closing of books in March, this year that demand did not
materialise, the group said.
The Japanese computer market in the past five months has been disrupted by
price cuts, which have eaten into the profit margins of computer
manufacturers.
Of the Y90bn difference between Fujitsu's profits forecast in October and
its latest forecast, Y75bn relates to its computer business, Y5bn to
electronic devices and Y10bn to communications equipment, Fujitsu said.
Fujitsu has a heavy financial burden after its purchase of ICL for Pounds
700m and recent expansion of its semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the
UK.
The group announced earlier this week that it would reduce graduate intake
next year to 300 people, compared with 2,200 this year and nearly 4,000 in
1989.
Capital spending is expected to remain at this year's level while R&amp;D
expenditure is gradually reduced.

SENIOR management at Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the world's third
largest steel company, changed yesterday for the second time in six months.
The reshuffle is related to the forced resignation from the state-run steel
company of Mr Park Tae-joon, its founder, for his political opposition to
South Korea's new president. The departure yesterday of Mr Park as Posco
honorary chairman triggered the resignation of two top aides, Mr Hwang
Kyung-ro, chairman, and Mr Park Tuk-pyo, president.
The two men were promoted last October when Mr Park stepped down as chairman
due to his refusal to support Mr Kim Young-sam as the presidential
candidate.
Posco's new chairman is Mr Chung Myung-sik, current vice-chairman. The new
president is Mr Cho Mal-soo, vice-president for new business investment and
purchasing.

FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais may fall into
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, the big French bank clouded by controversy following
aggressive expansion, last year had its worst results for two decades,
according to Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman.
This suggests that Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest banks and a
flagship of the French public sector, may have made a loss in 1992 since in
1974 the group fell into the red with a net loss of FFr177m (Dollars 31.49m)
under the impact of recession and a prolonged strike.
Mr Haberer said in an interview with a French newspaper yesterday that it
would not be possible to privatise Credit Lyonnais in current economic
conditions. France's conservative coalition, which is the firm favourite to
win this month's parliamentary elections, has confirmed that it hoped to
privatise both Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, the other
large state-controlled bank.
Credit Lyonnais was last year affected by the slowdown in the French economy
and the legacy of the aggressive lending policy it pursued since Mr Haberer
became chairman in 1988.
As a result, it has been much more vulnerable than other French banks to the
weakest areas of the economy, notably commercial property and small
businesses. It has been hit by its involvement with a number of
international corporate failures, including Mr Robert Maxwell's media group,
the Olympia &amp; York property company and MGM, the troubled Hollywood film
studio.
Mr Haberer, who was appointed by the current socialist administration and
whose position may be jeopardised by a change of government, blamed last
year's poor performance on a steep increase in provisions.
He said Credit Lyonnais had been badly affected by its exposure to property
and business failures in France and by the difficulties of its Dutch
subsidiary, which was responsible for the MGM deal.
Credit Lyonnais has announced that it barely broke even in the first half of
last year with net profits of just FFr119m after provisions of FFr6.3bn. Mr
Haberer said it would be forced to make higher provisions for the second
half.

FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: VW confirms Lopez has left key
position at GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest car manufacturer, confirmed yesterday that it
has persuaded Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to leave his job as head of
global purchasing at General Motors in the US.
The move comes only weeks after GM and VW both denied reports that Mr Lopez,
who has a reputation as a tough cost cutter, would be leaving to join the
German group as part of an overhaul of VW top management.
VW refused to say what Mr Lopez's role would be, but it is widely expected
that he will be put in charge of world purchasing following the meeting of
the company's supervisory board on Tuesday next week. Mr Lopez, who last
year moved within GM from Europe to Detroit, is credited with giving GM the
most competitive cost base of any of Europe's volume carmakers.
VW sold a record number of cars last year but is labouring under a number of
serious problems amid what chief executive Mr Ferdinand Piech last week
called the most severe downturn in the German car industry since 1945.
Part of the response has been to put pressure on suppliers to cut prices but
it is believed that the company plans to implement an overhaul of its
sourcing arrangements, headed by Mr Lopez.
Operating losses in the core VW division are thought to have been DM1bn
(Dollars 619m) last year.
The company is planning to cut its workforce by 36,000 people to 276,000 by
the end of 1997, a reduction of 13 per cent.
Mr Lopez's departure casts doubt on the future of GM's cost reduction
programme, which is a vital part of the company's efforts to restore to
profit its loss-making North American carmaking operations.
GM insisted yesterday that Mr Lopez had put in place a sufficiently strong
team, and so changed the group's methods of parts purchasing, that the
programme could roll on without him.
Some analysts said the costs drive was so much a product of Mr Lopez's
iconoclastic management style that it was likely to suffer from his
departure after only 10 months in the job.

FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: German bourse chief executive to
step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rudiger von Rosen, one of the most prominent figures in the campaign to
strengthen Germany's financial markets in recent years, is to step down as
chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, the single German stock exchange
which came into being at the beginning of the year.
The move came as a surprise in Frankfurt as it was only recently that Mr von
Rosen had his contract as chief executive renewed until the end of 1994.
He is to be replaced by Mr Werner Seifert, a Swiss businessman who is main
board director of Swiss Re responsible for the company's primary insurance
activities.
Mr von Rosen will retain his job as chief executive until the end of July
when Mr Seifert, 44, will take over. The official statement said that Mr von
Rosen would stay on as an ordinary member of the managing board but
Frankfurt financiers said that this was unlikely.
Mr von Rosen, 49, was not available for comment yesterday. He is a former
head of press relations at the Bundesbank and personal assistant to Mr Karl
Otto Pohl, former president of the German central bank.
He is one of the more outspoken figures on the German financial scene. He
left the Bundesbank in 1986 to take up a position as managing director of
the Frankfurt stock exchange, the largest in Germany.
He was an important figure in the campaign which led ultimately to the
creation of the Deutsche Borse, a holding structure which brings Germany's
eight regional stock-exchanges partially under one roof.
It encompasses the DTB futures and options market and the Kassenverein
settlements organisation.
Bankers said the move reflected the influence of Mr Rolf Breuer, main board
director of Deutsche Bank and head of the Deutsche Borse's supervisory
board. A statement issued by Mr Breuer said that Mr Seifert's appointment
was necessary to complete the Deutsche Borse's management board.
This would help the process of integrating the different parts of the
Deutsche Borse's activities and the goal of increasing the transparency and
liquidity of Germany's financial markets, the statement said.

FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: CRA bids ADollars 716m for coal
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining group, yesterday launched a hostile takeover bid
for Coal &amp; Allied Industries (Cail), a coal producer in the Hunter Valley
area of New South Wales, almost exactly two years after the failure of an
earlier offer.
The ADollars 11.50 a share bid values Cail at ADollars 716m (USDollars
487m). CRA owns 40.4 per cent of Cail following a ADollars 7.85 a share
offer in March 1991, and the purchase of a further 2.9 per cent stake
yesterday.
The offer is conditional on approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board
(Firb) because CRA is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, the world's
biggest mining group.
Mr John Ralph, CRA chief executive, said the acquisition of Cail was an
integral part of the group's strategy of increasing the size of its coal
business. However, he said the offer would not be increased.
Mr Tony Haraldson, Cail chief executive, urged shareholders not to respond
to the offer until it had been considered by the board. He said the board
would probably meet early next week.
The long-awaited bid represents CRA's second attempt to leapfrog Broken Hill
Proprietary (BHP) as Australia's biggest coal producer by acquiring control
of Cail.
The offer, which is pitched at 14 times average brokers' forecasts for
CAIL's earnings for the year ending June, represents a premium of 28 per
cent over the ADollars 9.05 closing price of Cail shares on Thursday.
However, Cail shares closed ADollars 2.05 higher at ADollars 11.50
yesterday.

HUDSON'S BAY, Canada's biggest retailer, surprised the market with a 31 per
cent gain in final-quarter profits to push earnings for the year ended
January ahead by 41 per cent, Robert Gibbens writes from Montreal.
The group benefited from strong Christmas sales, declining cross-border
shopping, lower interest costs and a better economy in western Canada.
Full-year profits were CDollars 116.7m (USDollars 93.8m) or CDollars 2.32 a
share, against CDollars 82.8m or CDollars 1.61 a share. Sales totalled
CDollars 5.15bn, up 2 per cent.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Week in the Markets: Gold edges above seven-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD ended the week, in the words of one analyst, 'clinging manfully to the
ropes by the skin of of its gold-capped teeth.' It closed on the London
bullion market yesterday at Dollars 327.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.20
on the week but holding above the successive seven-year lows seen earlier.
The market went into reverse from the beginning of the week, shedding
Dollars 2.80 on Monday and retreating to Dollars 326.05 on Wednesday. It was
fixed at consecutive seven-year lows on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The fall was heralded last week by the decline of South Africa's commercial
rand to 3.19 against the US dollar, pointed out Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst
at Williams de Broe. At Dollars 328 a troy ounce, South African producers
were able to sell their gold forward at R1,050, leaving them a healthy
profit.
The retreat below the recent trading range between Dollars 327 and Dollars
332 led many analysts to predict further falls. Mr Lawrence Eagles, of GNI
the London futures broker, said the market was looking very bad technically,
and predicted a rapid decline if Dollars 325 was breached, possibly to below
Dollars 300 by the end of the year.
While support has held at Dollars 325 this week, there is little apart from
Far Eastern demand to support the gold market, which has lost its lure for
investors in the West. 'There is a total lack of interest,' said Mr Euan
Worthington of SG Warburg. 'People have other games to play.'
Much of the demand in the Far East has come from China. A recent report from
American Precious Metals Advisors of the US suggested that the country
absorbed 800 tonnes (26m troy ounces) last year. This more than offset the
650 tonnes sold by central banks, including 400 tonnes by the Dutch.
The threat of further central bank sales continues to hang over the market,
while any rally is likely to be met by further producer sales - particularly
from South Africa.
Events in Russia, where Boris Yeltsin is fighting for his political
survival, have helped to boost platinum metal group prices because of fears
of supply disruption. Platinum ended up Dollars 6.95 on the week at Dollars
351.25.
But any so-called 'safe-haven' money is expected to go to the US dollar  -
and the stronger the dollar, the worse for gold.
As one London dealer told the Reuter news agency yesterday: 'Gold looks
awful which ever way you look at it.'
On the London Metal Exchange copper has shone dimly in a week of little
interest for the base metals. Three-month metal closed yesterday at Pounds
1,546.25 a tonne, up Pounds 48.50 on the week. In dollar terms it moved
above the Dollars 2,200 level.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, said that of all the base metals,
copper had the most robust fundamentals. Stocks on New York's Comex had
declined by 14 per cent from their mid-February peak to 97,116 tonnes,
giving a clear signal that the US was emerging from recession, he said.
However, Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist with RTZ, the world's biggest
mining group, said this week that while the US economy was recovering, the
German and Japanese economies were not. He pointed out that Western Europe
and Japan accounted for roughly half the Western World's consumption of
non-ferrous metals.
'Even with the US recovery gathering momentum, therefore, prices of metals
and minerals are unlikely to depart far from their present trading ranges
until late in the year at best,' he predicted.
In the softs markets cocoa has continued to slide, again giving delegates to
next week's International Cocoa Organisation council meeting plenty to chew
on as they struggle to reach a compromise that might lead to a new agreement
with economic clauses.
The London May contract closed yesterday at Pounds 689 a tonne, a fall of
Pounds 20 on the week and Pounds 73 off the recent peak.
The retreat has mainly been attributed to the failure of last week's talks
on the cocoa pact in Geneva. Profit taking by a few speculators who were
gambling on the talks succeeding turned into technical selling as chart
levels were breached.
'There has been long liquidation by the speculators, the trade, the funds
and the industry,' said Mr Tony Chadwick, of Prudential Bache. The situation
had been worsened by the fact that the market had absorbed a lot of selling
from producer countries during the recent rally.
Consumer and producer delegates in Geneva were able to agree only that
350,000 tonnes of cocoa should be withheld from the world market. They will
be trying next week to agree on how a withholding scheme should be financed,
and at what level prices should be defended. Any progress could lead them
back to Geneva.
The New York raw sugar market, which has been pushed over 10 cents a lb by
cuts in the estimated level of Thai production because of drought, went into
retreat at the beginning of the week. But yet another cut in the Thai
production forecast to 3.51m tonnes - the lowest level for five years -
moved the market smartly up again.
The fall in estimates for Thai production has been quite dramatic - from an
early season forecast of 5m tonnes it came down to 4.44m tonnes at the end
of last month and 3.86m tonnes last week. Thai production is likely to
remain the key factor in the sugar market, with some analysts expecting a
move above 11 cents soon.

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Airtours buys more shares as largest Owners
holder accepts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the holiday company, yesterday continued to buy shares in Owners
Abroad, the rival holiday company for which it is making a Pounds 294m offer
ahead of next Tuesday's close.
Airtours' shares rose 6p to 339p yesterday, allowing the company to buy
shares in the market at up to 150p, and taking its total purchases in the
last two days to 7.13 per cent of Owners.
Airtours is allowed, under takeover rules, to buy in the market up to a
price equal to the value of its paper offer, which at the close last night
was 149.3p.
It also emerged yesterday that Mercury Asset Management, Owners' largest
shareholder, had accepted the Airtours offer. After purchases of 400,000
shares on Thursday at an average price of 141.5p, MAM holds a 15.04 per cent
stake.
The pivotal shareholder is now Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, which has
been buying shares since the bid was launched and controls about 10.8 per
cent.
Phillips has not declared whether it will accept Airtours' offer which
leaves the outcome of the bid finely balanced.
City observers said yesterday that Thomas Cook, the travel agency, could
still block Airtours' bid by buying shares in the market next week.
Last Monday, Cook made a tender offer for 12.5 per cent of Owners' shares at
150p conditional on Airtours' bid failing. Instead of strengthening the
Owners' case, the move was broadly greeted as irrelevant, particularly as
Airtours' share price continued to climb.
A purchase in the market by Cook would be doubly effective if the shares
were bought from an Owners' shareholder that might have otherwise accepted
the Airtours' offers.
Airtours' brokers said last night that they were pleased with the purchases
in the market, even though there had not been enough sellers at 150p to
allow purchase of the 10 per cent stake it is allowed to buy under takeover
rules.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said he was confident last night but
added: 'This is a close run thing. Where would Owners' share price be
without the bid? I am urging shareholders to accept now.'

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pilkington expands via Pounds 95m purchase
 -Buy from Heywood will lead to bigger share of the UK market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glass group, is paying Pounds 95m for the UK and Irish glass
processing and distribution business of Heywood Williams, the building and
automotive components distributor.
Pilkington said the purchase would give it vertical integration in the UK
similar to the pattern in continental Europe. The acquisition follows the
1990 purchase by St Gobain, the French glass maker, of Solaglass, the second
largest UK glass distributor.
The deal, on which Heywood's shareholders will vote on April 1, has many
attractions for Pilkington. It would gain a leading 24 per cent of the UK
distribution market, letting it market new products direct to customers and
improve manufacturing capacity utilisation.
It would also enable Pilkington to use some of its unrelieved advance
corporation tax, and would immediately enhance earnings. Pilkington's shares
rose 7p to 108p.
However, analysts said the price was high, and feared that although
Pilkington would increase its sales to the Heywood business it could lose
sales to competitors.
Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington chief executive, said the group's lack of
control of distribution had put it at a disadvantage in the UK market.
If the deal goes through, the Heywood business would increase its glass
purchases from Pilkington from the current 60 per cent to 100 per cent.
This would lift Pilkington's capacity utilisation in the UK to about 95 per
cent.
Mr Leverton admitted that the price showed that Heywood 'understood the
strategic importance to a glass manufacturer' of gaining control of
distribution. But he said the merger benefits would in effect halve the p/e
Pilkington was paying.
The businesses being acquired were making an 'on-going' profit for 1992 of
Pounds 5.2m. The added benefit of an 8 per cent rise in the glass price from
February 1, which Mr Leverton said was 'absolutely sticking', would give an
exit p/e of about 17 before the merger benefits.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, executive chairman of Heywood, said the structure of
the UK glass market had changed radically in recent years, influenced by
glass prices down more than 30 per cent since 1988, higher imports and St
Gobain's acquisition of Solaglass.
'We came to the conclusion that the business under our ownership was
unlikely to return to satisfactory levels of profitability,' said Mr
Hinchliffe.
Mr Leverton was conscious that customers of Pilkington which compete with
the Heywood businesses could be upset by the tie-up. He said the operation
would be run on an arms length basis.
'About 50 per cent of the market is still held by independents who buy a lot
of glass from Pilkington. We must ensure that they can live comfortably with
us,' he said.
The deal would involve a goodwill write-off of Pounds 52.6m, and would be
financed by debt. This would increase Pilkington's gearing from 80 to 90 per
cent, Mr Leverton said.
However, Pilkington expects to recoup 'significantly more than Pounds 95m'
from the sale of its US spectacle lens business. It is also looking at
selling a stake in its Australian subsidiary.

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Few buyers are found for Isosceles debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENDERS to Isosceles, the Gateway food retail group in the middle of
restructuring talks with its banks and shareholders, are finding little
success in selling debt in the secondary market, traders said.
Although many deals have been mooted, at prices around half face value for
the senior debt, few trades have been completed, one New York based dealer
said.
Estimates were that about Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m of the Pounds 1.05bn of
senior debt had been sold.
The company said it had not been notified of any debt assignments. Buyers
could, however, purchase a 'sub-participation' in a loan which would mean
the original bank would still be regarded as the lender.
One banker involved in the refinancing talks said that anyone buying the
debt was taking a risk since the form of the restructuring was still not
agreed. An investor buying a sub-participation would not even get a 'seat at
the table' in the talks.
Bankers said the Isosceles talks were progressing and they hoped to agree
the refinancing in principle by the end of the month.
Isosceles has a standstill agreement with its banks until May 28, though one
said 'this could always be extended'.

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Heywood sale lifts share price 53p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Heywood Williams rose 53p to 239p yesterday on news that the
company was selling the part of its glass distribution business which
supplies the UK construction industry.
According to Heywood 59 per cent of its sales will continue to be generated
by the building industry despite the purchase of the largest part of its UK
glass division by Pilkington.
Heywood also announced that, including the business to be sold to
Pilkington, it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.5m in 1992, a decline of 71
per cent from Pounds 19.2m in 1991.
Despite a fall in earnings per share to 1.7p (17.4p) the company is
maintaining its final dividend at 8p, making a same-again 12.5p total.
Heywood will continue to sell glass to the automotive industry accounting
for another 33 per cent of sales. About 70 per cent of group turnover will
remain in the UK, according to Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, executive chairman.
There will, however, be a distinct shift in the balance between sales of
glass and those of plastic and aluminium - much of which is sold to the
building industry for doors and window units.
Plastic and aluminium in future will account for about 63 per cent of sales
compared with 37 per cent previously. Glass sales will shrink from 63 per
cent to less than 40 per cent, said Mr Hinchliffe.
He said the group was getting out of underperforming businesses which would
be better managed by an integrated glass manufacturer like Pilkington. This
would allow the company to concentrate on more profitable operations.
Sales of aluminium and plastic extrusions, mostly for housing repair and
maintenance, had risen by about 10 per cent during January and February
compared with the first two months of last year. Sales in the US, after a
record year in 1992, also remained strong.
European markets, however, remained under pressure due to the economic
recession.
According to the group, the book profit of Pounds 54m on the sale of the UK
glass business would, under FRS 3, provide a windfall gain of about Pounds
16m to pre-tax profits in the current year.
It would also leave the group with net cash of Pounds 65m which it planned
to use to finance acquisitions to expand its remaining businesses.

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: SmithKline Beecham suffers double blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs group, received a double blow
yesterday.
First, a US food and drug administration committee refused to recommend
Kytril, one of its most promising drugs. And secondly, a study was published
suggesting that Seroxat, its anti-depressant which analysts believe could
reach sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 700m), was no more effective
than earlier and far less expensive medicines. SB's shares fell 21 1/2 p to
469 1/2 p.
The study, published in yesterday's British Medical Journal, analysed 58
trials to compare old anti-depressants called tricyclics with a new
generation of anti-depressants called selected serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs).
These include SB's Seroxat, Eli Lilly's Prozac, and Pfizer's Zoloft.
The analysis suggested that SSRIs were no more efficacious than older and
cheaper tricyclics. SSRI manufacturers have never claimed this, but have
argued their drugs were more effective because they generate fewer side
effects. This allows more patients to continue taking their medicines.
However, the study claimed that 32.3 per cent of patients on SSRIs dropped
out of the clinical trials compared with 33.2 per cent on tricyclics.
SSRI manufacturers had previously claimed there was a 10 per cent difference
in drop-out rates, said Mr Nick Freemantle, research fellow at the Nuffield
Institute for Health at Leeds University and co-author of the study.
If that had been true, then the extra cost of SSRIs would have been money
well spent. A tricyclic can cost only Pounds 1.43 for 30 days treatment,
compared with up to Pounds 33.90 for an SSRI.
The only sales point left to the SSRIs was that they were less toxic than
tricyclics, said Mr Freemantle.
About 400 suicides a year are related to anti-depressants, he added.
The study concluded that first line treatment of depression using SSRIs may
greatly increase cost with only questionable benefits and that the drugs
should not be routinely used as a first-line treatment for major depression.
In the US, the FDA's gastrointestinal advisory committee were unable to
recommend approval of Kytril, because of potential carcinogenic and
cardiovascular side-effects.
Mr Bob Bauman, SB chief executive, said the committee had not felt competent
to comment on these issues. The drug is used to prevent nausea in cancer
patients receiving chemotherapy.
'We are confident we can resolve these issues with the FDA,' he said. 'We
have already satisfied 20 countries about the safety of this drug. There is
no evidence in humans of carcinogenic side-effects.'
Kytril had worldwide sales last year of Dollars 55m. Glaxo's equivalent drug
Zofran has been licenced in 63 countries and generated worldwide sales of
Pounds 163m during the last six of 1992.

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: EFM Dragon bid forces change at Drayton
Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAYTON ASIA, the far eastern investment trust, is giving its investors a
choice between a unit trust or a new split capital investment trust.
The proposals are designed to defeat an all-share bid from EFM Dragon, a
rival trust.
Those who choose the unit trust, Invesco MIM's South and East Asia Growth
Trust, will be able to realise their holdings for cash at about 98 per cent
of the diluted net asset value of Drayton Asia.
The proposed split capital Asian investment trust will have ordinary shares,
zero dividend preference shares and warrants. Investors will be able to
choose between a package of the three or a combination of shares and
warrants. The trust will be managed by Invesco MIM for a fee of 1 per cent a
year.
Drayton said that the investment trust proposals offered investors between
101.5 and 102.3 per cent of its diluted net asset value, compared with 98.7
per cent under the Dragon offer.
Mr Ratan Engineer, the chairman of Drayton Asia said: 'With these proposals,
shareholders and warrantholders will now have greater choice, enhanced
flexibility, new opportunities for gearing and most importantly, better and
certain value.
'On this basis, I strongly urge shareholders and warrantholders to continue
to reject the Dragon share offer.'
EFM Dragon responding by saying: 'These proposals are complex, uncertain as
to value and the timing of their implementation remains in doubt.'

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Church rises 11% despite Canadian
difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHURCH &amp; CO, the shoe maker and retailer, yesterday announced pre-tax
profits up almost 11 per cent from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.9m for 1992.
The improvement comes against a background of 'exceptionally difficult
trading conditions', particularly in Canada, the company said. There,
turnover increased by 11 per cent while operating losses grew to Pounds
455,000 (Pounds 54,000).
Mr John Church, chairman, said: 'The devaluation of sterling will help us
because we are so heavily involved in the export game.'
The final dividend is held at 9.5p for a maintained total of 12.5p,
uncovered by earnings per share of 12p (11.6p).
Group turnover increased 5.5 per cent to Pounds 68.9m (Pounds 65.2m) and
operating profits were little changed at Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 3.17m). Net
interest payable fell from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.09m.
The group said it was pleased with the performance of its UK retail and
manufacturing operations. Margins rose to 7.5 per cent (6.2 per cent) and
turnover advanced to Pounds 49.2m (Pounds 48.3m). US losses rose to Pounds
88,000 (Pounds 15,000).
A Jones &amp; Sons, Church's wholly-owned subsidiary, lifted pre-tax profits to
Pounds 569,000 (Pounds 290,000). Turnover increased to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds
28.7m). The dividend is again 34.1p, from earnings per share of 37.6p
(27.3p).

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Disgruntled franchisees consider action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disgruntled franchisees have met to consider what action they can take after
Mr Howard Hodgson, the former chairman of funeral parlour group, PFG Hodgson
Kenyon International, called the receivers into his latest business venture.
Receivers were appointed early last week to Prontac, a year old franchise
operation, which provides a computerised book-keeping and management
accounts service to small businesses through a network of 85 franchised
outlets.
Subsequently, Mr Hodgson called the receivers into Hodgson Securities, a
holding company, after months of difficulties with trading companies in the
group including Prontac.
The franchisees, who paid between Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 17,000 for a
franchise package and then claim they spent many thousands of pounds more
trying to secure a client base, were angry that they had been kept in the
dark about the company's problems.
Over half of them met on Thursday to consider what action they should take.
They claim that Mr Hodgson and his fellow directors failed to provide them
with the marketing expertise, a computerised accounting package that worked,
and the necessary support of a network of qualified accountants which they
had been promised.

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clark board considers bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark, the family-owned shoe manufacturer riven by
shareholder dissension, met yesterday to consider several bids for the
company, believed to be pitched at between Pounds 150m and Pounds 160m.
A decision on which offer will be recommended by the board is expected to be
announced in about two weeks, along with the group's annual results. These
are expected to show a slight improvement.
One bidder is a consortium of investors including existing institutional
shareholders and Electra Investment Trust. Other interested parties are
believed to include FII, the UK footwear manufacturer, and Berisford, the
food and property group.
Neither Berisford nor FII would confirm or deny involvement in the bid
process. Electra was unavailable for comment.
Speculation has centred on offers of between 180p and 220p per share. At
200p, Clark's would be valued at Pounds 154m.
C&amp;J Clark put itself up for sale in December following an acrimonious
boardroom row over development strategy. The dispute was triggered by a bid
approach from consultant Mr Colin Fisher and backed by Electra.
The four board rebels - led by Mr Lance Clark - who sought to unseat the
chairman Mr Walter Dickson and director Mr James Power last year are
expected to oppose a sale unless the price comes in at the top end of the
range.
It is believed they want to retain family control of the business, but would
be unable to refuse a high enough price.
The decision to put the company on the open market was part of a truce
agreed with the rebels last October.
The bid process began in December when Clark's set up a committee to review
offers. Clark's said the board had met five potential bidders. However,
sources close to the tender said that only three bids had been tabled.
It is known that many members of the 500-strong Clark family, which controls
70 per cent of the private group, would be keen to sell their shares. Many
of them, dependent for their livelihood on the company's dividend payments
and hard hit by Lloyds' losses, were shocked when depressed trading and
losses forced the group to slash the interim payout by 50 per cent.
In the six months to July, Clark recorded a Pounds 3.5m pre-tax loss on
sales of Pounds 285.1m.

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Huntingdon shares fall 22% on profits
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Huntingdon International Holdings, the life sciences and
engineering services group, fell by nearly 22 per cent yesterday after a
profits warning and the announcement of a rationalisation of its US-based
engineering and environment services group.
The shares closed 45p down at 163p.
Huntingdon said that trading conditions for the US companies were now even
worse than when it announced its first quarter profits of Pounds 3.73m last
month. It further reduced its profit expectations for the second quarter.
At the time of the figures announcement it blamed continuing weakness in the
US economy and abnormal weather.
Huntingdon is closing 10 of the engineering and environmental services' 80
US offices 'as a result of a strategic review of the company's US
businesses, and in the light of the continuing decline in some areas of the
US construction and environmental markets.' The construction sector has
historically contributed more than 50 per cent of the company's US revenues.
The costs, estimated at Pounds 3m or 2.5p per share, will be taken as an
exceptional charge in the present quarter, and is expected to result in an
after-tax loss. In last year's second quarter pre-tax profits were Pounds
3.37m.
An improvement in US trading was not expected until a general revival in the
economy reached the construction industry.
However the management said that the performance for the the rest of the
year to September 30 should be ahead of last year, helped by the continuing
strong performance of the life sciences group and the Travers Morgan
consulting engineers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Headway, the consumer and industrial goods specialist, reduced pre-tax
losses from a restated Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 883,000 in the six months to
December 31.
The company, however, budgets for a first-half loss as sales by its dominant
garden furniture subsidiary, Aronstead, are heavily biased towards the final
quarter.
Losses this time were struck after costs of Pounds 103,000 for the major
reorganisation of Aronstead.
Turnover for the period was Pounds 10.05m (Pounds 11.11m) and losses per
share were halved at 3.7p. The results have been prepared in accordance with
FRS 3.

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cut in interest boosts Cussins Property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cussins Property Group, the residential property developer, reported profits
of Pounds 740,000 pre-tax for 1992, against losses of Pounds 365,000.
Turnover fell from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 16.3m.
The main reason was a fall in interest charges from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds
657,000. The company said a large part of the comparable figure related to
discontinued activities. Borrowings were also cut over the 12 months from
Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 6.5m.
A tax credit of Pounds 733,000 (Pounds 150,000) helped earnings increase to
10.3p (losses 1.9p). However an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.71m (Pounds
2.36m), including a full provision on commercial property, left the loss for
the year at Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 2.58m).

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: KBL extends Brown Shipley bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KREDIETBANK Luxembourg-eoise has extended its 30p-a-share offer for Brown
Shipley Holdings by a week until next Thursday after adding acceptances of
only 1.4 per cent to the 29.8 per cent of the equity that it already owns,
writes Jane Fuller.
Since KBL launched the offer, which values BSH at Pounds 4.8m, on February
18, a potential rival has appeared. Guinness Peat Group, the UK investment
vehicle for New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley, has taken a 22.3 per
cent stake, paying 35p a share for the majority of it. BSH's share price
closed at 43p yesterday.
GPG announced this week that it was contemplating making a full bid and
asked for the same information as had been furnished to KBL.
KBL has stressed that its offer is the only one on the table.

FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: British Gas uncertainty behind Victaulic
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY over the future of British Gas was behind Victaulic's 5.4 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year end to December 31.
Profits at the pipes and fitting maker fell from Pounds 14.32m to Pounds
13.55m on reduced sales of Pounds 101.2m (Pounds 114.8m).
The company's main market with British Gas has suffered from the uncertainty
over the future structure and ownership of the pipeline network.
Mr David Stewart, managing director, said British Gas had cut back on all
discretionary spending on the network unless there was a pay-back within a
year.
'There has also been a squeeze on costs because of the pricing formula on
domestic gas.'
Mr Stewart believes the uncertainty will continue after publication of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the future of British Gas. 'I
do not think we will see any benefits until 1994' said Mr Stewart.
In the group's other main market, there was a reduction in the level of
refurbishing distribution mains in the water industry. However, the company
benefited from the increased penetration of the market by polyethylene pipe.
Lindapter International, which sells and designs specialised construction
products, was bought from the receiver of Henry Barrett Group for Pounds
4.8m.
The group still ended the year with net cash of Pounds 6.2m.
Earnings per share fell to 20.3p (21.25p). The final dividend is increased
to 5.3p (5p) giving a total of 7.8p (7.35p).

FT  13 MAR 93 / Fortune favours the big: Alan Cane on the effects of a
computer price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compaq, the personal computer manufacturer, cut the cost of its products in
the US this week, signalling another round of blood-letting in a price war
which is devastating the industry.
Victims include comparatively well known names like Everex of the US, now
protected by the provisions of the US bankruptcy code.
By the end of the year many smaller suppliers are expected to find
themselves in equally dire straits, leaving the pc business essentially in
the hands of the industry giants - IBM, Compaq, Apple and Dell.
Computer buyers, on the other hand, have never had it so good. A colleague,
seeking an economical computing package to handle the business of his local
parish, was quoted Pounds 1,760 for a powerful pc complete with ink jet
printer and office software. Over two weeks, the price was reduced by Pounds
200.
In the US, the cheapest of Compaq's pcs now sells for Dollars 1,100. In the
UK, Vtec, a supplier from Hong Kong, sells a similar machine with
sophisticated software for Pounds 1,099. Prices for machines of equivalent
power would have been over Pounds 5,000 only a few years ago.
Industry ob-servers are not yet decided whether such price cutting can
continue. Some argue that it is unrealistic to expect prices to fall
further, but that additional features will be included at the same price.
Software, for example, can be included as part of the deal. Sold separately,
the Lotus software included with Vtec's Pounds 1,099 package would cost the
customer about Pounds 700. Vtec is able to offer such a deal because, for
substantial volumes, software can be bought from software suppliers very
cheaply.
Other analysts suggest that at least two more rounds of cuts equivalent to a
further 25 per cent decline in prices can be expected.
In the short term, however, further falls are unlikely in the UK, where the
fall in the value of the pound is already forcing some smaller pc
manufacturers to raise prices.
But over the next few years, for the international market as a whole, the
most likely outcome is that the pace of price cutting, running at some 40
per cent a year, will slow sharply but that prices will continue to fall.
The decline in prices is already prompting a shift in the balance of power
in the industry. In particular, the success of 'no-name' clone makers, is
being reversed. No-name companies, manufacturers with little track record in
the computer business, had been taking market share from established
suppliers, selling copies of IBM's standard design at a substantial
discount. Vobis of Germany, for example, grew from nothing to take 4 per
cent of the European market last year, selling 368,000 machines, according
to the market consultancy InfoCorp.
The reversal of the trend can be dated to June 15 last year when Compaq,
world leader in high-performance pcs, launched a range of machines priced
only slightly higher than the no-name competition.
Given the choice between a machine from an anonymous manufacturer and a
Compaq for only a few dollars more, customers opted enthusiastically for the
branded product. Compaq, found itself unable to meet orders. 'We thought
demand might double,' says Mr Joe McNally, managing director of Compaq's UK
subsidiary. 'In fact it quadrupled and at one stage you had to wait six to
eight weeks for delivery.' Compaq's initiative was swiftly matched by IBM,
which launched its own low cost 'Value Point' computers.
The market has been boosted as a result. According to Mr Gordon Curran of
InfoCorp, most pc dealers in Europe, with the exception of the UK, saw sales
in the first six weeks of the year increase by about 10 per cent compared
with the same period last year.
Availability has become an important new consideration; many manufacturers
failed to anticipate the demand for new, cheaper products and found
themselves short of stock. The problem has been exacerbated by shortages of
components, including flat, liquid crystal screens for laptop computers and
some varieties of the Intel microprocessor chip at the heart of the majority
of pcs.
Clone makers are being squeezed from two directions. From one side, they are
finding it difficult to meet the challenge of the big brands now their price
advantage has been pared away.
From the other, unless they have a strong relationship with Intel and other
suppliers, they will be forced to buy critical components on the open
market. A high-performance chip which a large manufacturer can buy in bulk
at Dollars 60 a piece could cost Dollars 100 to Dollars 500 a piece in the
market, if it can be obtained at all.
It all adds up to a grim outlook for clone manufacturers. They will see
their bigger competitors increasingly regain control of the market for both
sophisticated personal computers able to take the place of minicomputers and
for low-cost systems, which will be bought by large organisations, small
businesses and individuals for home use.
It is no coincidence that Digital Equipment, the world's largest
minicomputer maker, is redoubling its efforts in pcs with the aim of being
one of the world's five top suppliers by 1995. Nor is it surprising that
Olivetti, Europe's biggest pc manufacturer, is preparing to launch a new
range of machines with which it hopes to steal Compaq's thunder. Mr Corrado
Passera, Olivetti managing director says: 'Price war is the name of the game
and we are ready to play it.'

FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Liberal Democrats show consistency on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES KENNEDY MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Major must persevere' (March 10) is wrong to accuse the
Liberal Democrats of having become 'shameless opportunists' over the
progress of the Maastricht Treaty ratification legislation.
We have been principled and consistent throughout. Last November we
supported the government over the 'paving motion' debate; subsequently,
unlike the Labour Party, we have been willing to vote with the government
over key procedural votes which have made possible the passage of the Bill.
In several of these divisions our votes have been essential to secure
progress.
We have made clear from the outset our ambition to see Maastricht improved
in two particular respects - viz, reversing the UK opt-out over the social
chapter and winning greater institutional democracy at all European levels.
Monday's vote was consistent with the latter objective.
The real 'blame for delay' rests with a prime minister who has been too
timid for too long in seeking to face down his rebels. This week's setback
is a failure of coherent Tory government, not constructive Liberal Democrat
opposition.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Cost of marketing PEPs inevitable - as is cost to
clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S M C KELLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Philip Coggan ('The high costs of 'good' advice', March 6) examines
three PEPs recently launched by Fidelity, M&amp;G and Cazenove and concludes
that M&amp;G 'is not being greedy' with its high charging structure - it's just
that it has to pay commission to intermediaries.
You may think it odd then that M&amp;G still attracted more money directly from
the general public than Cazenove with much lower charges. The reason is that
M&amp;G had a much larger marketing campaign to promote its PEP and the costs
are of course borne by the client. There is no point in launching a new
product unless people buy it: therefore, unless a company like Cazenove can
promote its product more cheaply through favourable press comment or
existing discretionary clients then it has to advertise, direct mail or pay
commission to intermediaries.
His argument that intermediaries should recommend Cazenove over M&amp;G on a
pure charging structure is absolutely right. However, he fails to mention
that if we did then by the time our fees had been removed the client would
be in exactly the same situation. After all, we have to pay for our own
marketing costs as do M&amp;G and Cazenove.
Mr Coggan states that the FT would much rather see fee charging financial
advisers and I can assure you that I would as well. However, the average
member of the public is still not ready to pay fees in the same way that
they do for accountants and solicitors.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Taurus the victim of unclear objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK H BROOME
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Taurus fiasco ('Stock market chief quits over Taurus', March 12)
shows the folly of trying to implement complex information technology
projects without clear objectives related to requirements of the end
customer.
In this case vested interests, particularly registrars with jobs on the
line, appear to have been most in mind. Any first year computer student
knows the problems involved in splitting up databases without real need.
William of Ockham had it right first time - Keep it Simple, Stupid]
Last July we changed our bank, and produced 30 or so unnecessarily
complicated transfer forms on our own computer for the appropriate
registrars: we are still fielding payment errors. Separate registrars are
redundant in such a system; the whole process should be centralised and
payment instructions altered on the authority of the registered beneficiary
without the need for all trustees to sign.
National Savings are much better organised and far less costly and
bureaucratic, and we had few problems with other government departments.
Smaller private investors without their own administrative back-up should
steer clear of the stock market - with or without Taurus.
